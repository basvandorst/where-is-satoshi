I had my 2fa account hacked. I believe there is a 2fa hack.( I am still investigating – so not 100% sure)but believe this is how they got in below:
 Once they have access to your email account they  usally put on a redirect and also attach a gmail account with recover via a code to your main email ( your phone must on that email as recover and 2fa)
They go a password reset on the exchange account and do a recover password on the gmail account  at same time . which send a 6 digit code to your hacked email . they use the recovery link and that code to get in . ( this I believe how they go in to my exchange account)

could not get Bitcoin core wallet 0.15.1 to send bitcoin to Electrum v3.0.3 to a SegWit address
it starts with bc1 -( address show up in red)
make it hard to use segwit if the main wallet does not support this feature

at present I am using a new phone and email just to be safe. till I understand it better

I believe they do both ---- any breach of rule = Freeze account and report to Government ---- otherwise you could draw out funds and disappear -- also depend on $ amount --- Less than $10k may be ok - 1 million dollars = freeze

are you sure? I read somewhere it treated as  a commodity . mean it has capital tax . also you need to prove ownership ??
bank doing thier job --- they report you to the aust gov and freeze your account till all is sorted out

yep! we know - buy $10 of bitcoin with at $20 fee and wait a month for confirmation make perfect sense . However your $10 could be worth $200 by this time next year .

what about fee from exchange to your wallet ? and from your wallet to the  exchange ? . mempool backlog massive - fee expensive - business ending bitcoin usage due to high tx fees and long delays .

does kraken have segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:40:12
well if you walk into a bank with $100k in cash and tried to put it into your bank account - they would freeze your account and report you.
so if you transfer $100k from a Crypto activity - it like cash --- tax man wants 50% - government wants to make sure it does not come from crime. so the freeze you account. I guess you need to spent it in a casino or horse racing -- or find a place where they laundered money . Other than that you need to prove owership and pay tax.

be carefull with bitstamp I had a bad experience , I tranfered 30 bitcoins and to a new account - it  got hacked at transfer time  and bitcoin got tranfered out to hackers wallet . What the hacker did was close my account and bitstamp did not sent me an email to authorize bitcoin transfer . in all lost 30 bitcoins .

is a 120,000 nodes good ? - bitcoin has about 20 million users . 
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:32:26
I agree an attack is coming this month - but not with price rise. I believe BCH people want to take over BTC and will use hash power to do it.  BCH with new  DAA change can do blocks every 10 minutes on very little hash power.
They will point all hash power to bitcoin make sure it high - then remove it - and point all the hash power  to BTC2x chain or back to BCH . BTC1x will have no hash power(or very little)  and unable to do blocks every 10 minutes and cannot do transaction causing panic in + $100 billion economy so then 2x or BCH may become the longest chain. and will become the new bitcoin --- anyway that my guess
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:53:29
I don't believe BTC core will even consider 2 x change at present or even as a good PR. they are very talented  group – one of world  best software development group  and we are lucky to have them .however they are acting as group of arrogant prima donnas . You need to hedge. There will be issues in November.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:08:15
people follow the money . if B2X is the main chain plenty of node will follow - also most exchanges already have B2x node . I don't believe you need many node to run bitcoin - its only 3 transaction per sec and small blocks ,all miners will run nodes if mining b2x - this is at about 80%- exchange only require 6 node to validate a coin(also see BCH they have enough node to run the network)
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:58:08
BCH have a plan -H/F it not a bug - BCH forked so they can mine coins every 10 minutes with very little mining hardware . they plan to use mining hardware on BTC to get the difficulty very high and then stop this may result in BTC not having any blocks for many hour making BTC un -usable . they then hope to take over the chain and become the real BTC. ( yes it sound like a fairy tale)
They have the longest chain, they have exchanges,they have 75% mining power, they have deep pockets,and they may have 50% of "bitcoin" users on side
after all they own bitcoin.com  (we the BTC core people have bitcoin.org)
new people and some user will be confused . general market won't care . and they have not broken any laws - November will be an interesting month....
BTC people will be busy  -  fighting B2X split
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:28:02
could drop to $0 tomorrow - Gold=No - Bitcoin= Yes
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:34:37
If you buy B2x now at $1500 and take over $125 billion chain and B2x is perceived as an "upgrade" therefore becomes bitcoin at + $7000 you may make up $100m in no time.
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:02:38
I run a full core node as well - 1 cpu = 1 vote . and I do care . If tx take too long and fee's become to high bitcoin will become unusable and will be worthless and will die or BCH will become the new bitcoin - yes take bitcoin name -- they own bitcoin.com and new users don't know the difference

Can a node run on whm/cpanel?

Thanks I already run a node at home. don't like that my ip is tied to a node and wallet  --- some governments like to spy . -- I try and hide behind a vpn --- I was looking for cheap alternative

Thank  --cpanel is very low cost -- I guess it will run on windows hosting

20 million people have bitcoin . 13,000 have nodes  so I don't see how you Know what user want . IMO - I would think most users don't care if its 1x,2x or BCH . as long as bitcoin increase value ,they hold bitcoin to be rich . IE $ value is king. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:09:50
if core did 2x it would be ok - because we trust core code.( I believe it also on core road map agreed a few year ago)
IMO - the only reason we got segwit was because of NYA people - so we should upgrade to 2x but core does the code. we will need 2x anyway in a few years  and it would help clear tx backlog and lower fee's  . segwit is only deployed in very few exchanges and may take another 2 years before we see any improvements due to segwit -  so 2x helps bitcoin in short term and long term
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:21:27
all part of the BCH plan to take over the BTC chain
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:42:16
or a bug in the code or BCH wins or s2x wins
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:46:25
I still think it a risk . and should be taken into account if selling airdrops . They may have lined up mining support and could end up the main chain .

if s2x have more than 51% hash power,200 full  nodes, plus economic node at most exchanges and have the longest chain - can s2x become bitcoin ? .
a lot of people believe s2x is a upgrade to bitcoin and does not need relay protection

@_date: 2017-11-07 01:08:55
I have seen it referred to as a "upgrade"  to bitcoin so 2x is the new bitcoin  therefore does not require relay protection. however because core did not do this code I will trust only the 1x chain . (core code). - new user to bitcoin will not know the difference and will not care
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:58:28
buying S9  would take to long and this is going to happen this month NOV 2017.  I being a user of BTC since 2011 and this year is the time I felt that there are high risks in holding the right coin because I believe with the value of BTC being very high; and more than one group of people want to control BTC. It is possible that BCH - which controls a lot of mining power and may have access to mining rigs through some back door code take control of the BTC chain via some sort of attack . all I am trying to say is be careful because it possible that 2x or BCH could be the next BTC and don't under estimate 2x or BCH people . 
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:58:00
some people call it an upgrade to bitcoin  ie  faster tranfers and lower fees now . ( but it really want do away with core - because segwit will take another 2 years to implement and core will not add biger blocks any time soon) we need core so we will have to put up with a slow network
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:17:48
most of the miner go to where they can make the most money - they will make sure it is BCH .
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:47:35
 segwit is going to fix this ? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:45:12
bitcoin 2x could become bitcoin--- they have 80% hash rate,most of the exchange support and have full node , the can easly run up 2000 bitcoin 2x full node , could have the longest chain (80% hash power  ( and not mine on bitcoin 1x).bitcoin.com on side  all you need is a few whale buy 2x coin  now and  - taking over the chain and making lot of $$$ because they brought 2x cheap
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:41:52
how will this decentralize mining ?
you need a country with cheap labour ,cheap electricity and good internet . You can already buy your ant miner and install it anywhere in the world . all this give us is a second manufacturer in china.. just need a country with electricity at $0.02 per kw/h 
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:16:30
yes - stop in fighting ---concentrate on Fixing slow transaction and high fee's ---exchanges and wallets implement segwit soon

@_date: 2017-10-27 01:11:27
Thank for your comments, I am suggesting that core codes the 2x code or tell us when they plan to do this. The hope is to stop in fighting in the bitcoin community and this may lead to other coders   dropping their 2X plan because they can see a clear path to bigger blocks via core
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:46:44
I hope it soon . or they tell us when
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:45:57
I think core doing 2x is an opportunity to get some of the business people back on side and not have an un tested and  unwanted fork  . IE good PR -  make friend instead of more enemies
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:19:31
maybe core need to tell us of there plans -it is good PR - and this may stop people being divided on bitcoin direction or not knowing .
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:39:31
it up to you .just trying to help with risk advise
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:41:00
To some extent the NYA people helped get segwit implemented and they would like to implement 2x. If core does the code mostly everyone will be happy and use the code. If the NYA people do the code it put bitcoin at risk. So in my opinion it is better to have the bitcoin community happy than in fighting and take risks on bad code with no relay protection.  One day we will slip up and destroy bitcoin and no body win other than alts
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:29:35
no just November go read /btc
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:10:35
I don't understand . Why does core not want to consider to write the code for a 2X upgrade even if it at a later date. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:31:58
It a PR exercises. If it core code it will not be a hard fork - I run a full core node  0.15.0.1 – I don’t care if it ~ + 300GB – at present bitcoin community is being torn apart by in fighting – we  will wake up one day and a alt coin will have taken over
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:39:53
thanks - reading link
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:26:46
only advice -- if you extract s2x from current btc chain and sell them  and it become the BTC chain you could lose money . I don't care and have no "corporate bosses"
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:54:41
I think the 2X people want a clear path to compete with BCH and other ALTS --- core needs to react by announcing that path with some time scale – this may result of having more of the bitcoin community on side
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:06:47
I think it’s more a PR exercise. The NYA people believe 2x will fix congestion issues and allow bitcoin to go forward. I am led believe this is an easy code mod for core  where the compression code to improve from  2-4 MB will be complex and may take years and this compression  code will work on top of 2x . We need to give user and business people and upgrade path and also give no reason for other groups to release bitcoin code that will result in a fork EG BCH and maybe an S2x fork . so what I am trying to say make friends with NYA people by giving them what they want and also it will put a lot of pressure on the BCH as core  bitcoin should have about the same transaction per seconds as BCH. ( sorry not an expert on bitcoin just a user since 2011)
