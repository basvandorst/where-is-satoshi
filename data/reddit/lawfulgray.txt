And in 20 it will say bitcoin and altcoins only.
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:32:04
... That feel when you don't own any btc and so you want it to drop enough that you can buy some
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:46:03
but does it have the name? also, Im worried people might confuse the 2.
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:04:46
How was the JEWISH Karl Marx anti-Semitic?
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:16:19
One might think they are counting on confusion between the 2.

Oh hahaha.... take your upvote.

Semitic is not the same word as semitism. Im only informing you of the dictionary's definition.
I only found it interestion cause anti-semitism could mean 2 different things depending on how is used; discrimination against semites, or alternatively, being against the promotion of jewish charistics, ideas, and influence.

Does he bring up the jewish ethnicity or just the jewish religion?
Also on an unrelated note. I actually thought semitism meant the jewish ethnicity and since I was wrong and what it actually meant surprized me. I thought I would post its definition.
Semitic characteristics, especially the ways, ideas, influence, etc., of the Jewish people.
I even checked other dictionaries to be sure that definition was right.

Oh no I spilled a raw egg on the pizza.
Don't waste the dough, just cook it slightly and tell the customer its a special menu item.

Better pineapples than egg

Was about to say, Bitcoin isn't made better by the inclusion of banks. Infact, centralization is one of the biggest threats to the existence of a free and open form of exchange.
@_date: 2019-01-19 18:48:01
But wouldnt that mean it wasnt a chicken egg, but an egg that had a chicken in it?
@_date: 2019-01-28 04:19:27
Lmao! Yeah, im sure this is the first person to think to buy drugs with bitcoin.

Sorry son I already spent it on this bag of grass.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:22:21
Nah, he is just screwing with your imagination

The us dollar could be inflated at will (and was/is). Ill take the gold.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:42:52
cause its a metaphor for a menis.

You sure it wasnt that the rest of the industrial world was bombed and you had to buy american goods?
@_date: 2018-04-05 09:34:42
So what like some means of force in the hands of the individual to counter the force of the state? Or did you mean a set of rules that dictate the limits on what the state is permitted to make laws upon?

I don't remember that movie well, I pretty much only remember a round sphere bot entering the UN to address the world leaders before detonating itself with a nuclear bomb.

Bitcoin, still worth thousands of times more than US dollars.

Yes, but you still have the choice to choose to be inefficient or risky.
