Amazon was an innovational online marketplace. Walmart is very much still the king of retail.
They were not direct 1:1 competitors when Amazon launched, and Amazon could not have risen as a standard retail store because Walmart would have murdered Amazon.
So his point still stands.

I had problems withdrawing $1600 in coins with an ACH transfer. I called MtGox a couple times during the course of a month and they just stalled.
However, I then asked them to change my withdrawal back into BTC, which I then transferred to an outside wallet. This got me my coins in a couple hours, which saved me from losing everything when MtGox swindled everyone about a week later.

I mean, the cloud is basically just a hard drive. There's just a lot of company hardware in between your computer and that hard drive.

I cannot imagine a more perfect response to such an absurd comment.

34 coins in 2012, sold in 2013 Made about $1,400.
I'm happy about it I guess.
It would have been lost to MtGox anyway.
