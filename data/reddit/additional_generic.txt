So .... do you owe them 5k or $100?

Y’all are disappointing me.  Do yourself a solid and watch Spaceballs. r/wooosh

Know your client, a law all US exchanges must follow.

He himself may not have any idea what bitcoin is, but he has happened to appoint a couple BTC positive people to relevant positions.
@_date: 2019-07-07 01:09:51
Wait, you thought it was real?
@_date: 2019-07-02 00:11:25
Why does “$100 worth of CBT on 50x leverage” even mean?
@_date: 2019-07-11 09:07:04
When will then be now?

There is a penis on the line that it happen by the end of next year.
@_date: 2019-07-02 00:41:03
So do you have to pay a fee on every trade?  If you turn the “5k” into 50k do you just give it back?
@_date: 2019-11-05 14:39:16
I have seen so much hate for those here , why?

Or to be in an elected position
@_date: 2019-08-24 17:54:52
Ah yes, you listened to the propaganda.
The truth is, bitcoin is trivial to use, but only sophisticated uses are able to perform an anonymous transaction on the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:27:26
Wait a second... what...... exactly is going on here
@_date: 2019-10-18 23:14:17
It is trivial to generate a new address, if you are paranoid move it nao
@_date: 2019-08-17 04:54:19
Just you
@_date: 2019-06-18 18:19:15
It is pretty trivial to follow ownership of nearly all the BTC in existence.  Surveillance is already here.

Season one was so good, season two was such trash

Without physical access it approaches 0. With physical access it is possible with an exceptionally sophisticated attack, Precision and skill through the roof.

Coinbase, where it takes you three weeks to get registered and they tax you more than most BTC ATMs.
@_date: 2019-06-19 19:23:24

Bitcoin is a Yuman right.

Sorry I use the term tax to apply to any fee or cost of use.  MTG term slipping into normal speak.

They follow all laws so no?

CoinFlip ( CoinFlip.tech ) has 2 way ATMs.  They they have a 3.99% sell fee.  That is better than some exchanges.
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:58:13
I am unsure what the Coinbase fee is.
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:11:01
I don’t think google will give someone with no experience the ability to safely remove a secured tamper resistant chip from the board, open the secure chip properly and use a it to retrieve the positions, then be able to consume the millions of positions and determine the seed.

Valid, Facebook is evil for sure.

Why only expose US citizens?  You don’t need an SSN to generate an address and participate in the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:41:50
10k has been considered an important “psychological barrier”. If BTC sustains this a month it will be pretty important.
@_date: 2019-06-29 05:59:53
Man I was mining back when the coinbase was 100 BTC and 100 BCH and you also got 15 Kanye coin.
@_date: 2019-12-22 15:58:52
These guys refuse to list sum coin
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:56:15
It is kinda foolish to say you heard about BTC before the genesis block.  At least you see that.
The number of people who had heard of BTC before genesis has to be around 30 people.
@_date: 2019-06-17 03:16:32
Idk, Coinbase is 2.99 flat a sell right?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:36:38
[clay pirate]. Well yes.. but also no.
@_date: 2019-09-06 00:56:42

There should be a bot that simply says this then locked the thread every time this question is asked.
@_date: 2019-05-20 10:39:37
Not likely... I could see a world where that could happen, but honestly that is as likely as John McAfee eating his own dick
@_date: 2019-05-18 22:00:27
Well, lol that is an image of a DC power network, that actually was not suited to be able to scale.
Tesla has to create AC power for our power grid to actually scale.
