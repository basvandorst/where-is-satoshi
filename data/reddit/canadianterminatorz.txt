Yeah i fucking hate ASICs. They create centralized processing power that makes Bitcoin less secure

Keep patting yourself on the back OP...
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:00:06
Bitcoin should not be the only currency. Other cryptos provide benefits too that are not available with bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:30:14
There is no point. Just people patting themselves on the back as r/bitcoin has been doing for over 5 years

Encrypting is a good idea. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-01-31 01:30:16
Looks like I missed the gold rush. Ahh well I'll just buy some with my BTC :D
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:13:42
But I can generate the public address from the private key, correct?
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:39:33
Thank you for helping me. I'm going to create an encrypted backup instead and verify that it works.

Do you see any possible negative consequence of writing down the private key of an altcoin and then deleting the program off the computer?
@_date: 2014-02-19 08:22:32
Oooh! Thank you for reminding me. I totally forgot about change addresses. 
@_date: 2019-11-26 00:32:38
Yep, this subreddit has been this way for at least 6 years.

A fellow local. Fuck this city
@_date: 2018-06-23 22:23:40
I bought mine in 2013 on localbitcoins

But lightning network isn’t on mainnet is it?
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:19:15
I bought the top 8 and boy was I fucking stupid
@_date: 2018-11-30 15:48:38
People get paid today so hopefully they buy to drive the price up. I hope ��

I did this 5 years ago and have made 60k from it. I bought 2k of bitcoin then and now it paid off my entire loans :)
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:08:06
Even if I sold now I've made 40k. Veteran of the 1k crash

And before someone says buying immediately is better 66&amp; of the time. I should remind people that this may be true for stocks but not necessarily for crypto as it's an unregulated market subject to pump and dumps. Personally, I'll stick with DCA especially since I get regular surplus paychecks
@_date: 2018-07-13 19:18:33
Let's just conveniently ignore how high Bitcoin's fee were last year and pat ourselves on the back huh r/Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-04 09:42:45
Ahah :) in 2013 I ended up unsubscribing because of anxiety. Worked out well. But I'm back. Going to keep buying crypto regularly now
@_date: 2018-04-04 09:55:07
Is the Blacklist worth watching?
@_date: 2018-04-04 09:20:27
As typical. It's best to ignore it for a few years tbh
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:16:01
Got paid today! I'm buying $400 worth
@_date: 2018-12-15 23:58:36
Bitcoin is meant to be a digital currency that doesn’t rely on a trusted third-party (like a bank, credit Union, Venmo, Paypal). What other way do you know of that can do that?
@_date: 2018-12-22 01:59:37
I'd like an example on iOS too
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:17:12
I think they're legitimately running out of bitcoin, because I can't find any on localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:00:04
Monero is superior for this imo. However all darknet markets accept Bitcoin and not enough support Monero
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:33:40
I've just checked :) And people are actually selling. Sorry. But they're selling at around $950 CAD
