I'd be happy to buys shit with btc, but it's just way too akward to do when all the sites I care about don't take it and the few sites I come across that do I either don't care about or are just overly complicated as opposed to clicking PayPal, or tapping a fingerprint sensor (if on mobile)

[insert literally anything here]
"This is good for bitcoin!"
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:34:51
Well it went down a lot since  so the only other perfective available would be standing on my head to make that look not down, stop circlejerking BTC if you have nothing useful to add.
@_date: 2018-07-13 05:52:58
Well I hope Mr Bitcoin reads your well founded post and adjust ms the price accordingly 
@_date: 2018-07-30 08:43:02
Bitcoin does not have the features to even compete with a crippled just one of those fiat companies
Stop posting crap
@_date: 2018-11-13 20:18:59
Yeah, and companies have the right not to work with anyone, you can't force them to serve so wine they don't feel would be good to associate with

Fuck off with these posts guys, no ones gonna say 'yeah, I like bitcoin, it sure does have some spectacular memes, I done know anything else of it but the memes are DANK/10'
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:41:56
How so? I hold some, but I don't lie to myself/others saying BTC is the most amazing thing and we're all going to the moon and only have discussions about price when it's doing well. Seeing it as some magic currency, that's the shitty strategy.
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:45:00
I hope it gets to $999,999.99

@_date: 2018-07-24 14:45:02
For the most part though serious discussions will get brushed aside by memes / other shitposts
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:18:10
Do you have any reasoning bitcoin is doing well other than the fact it's not going down yet?
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:13:20
Three bulls heard the rancher was bringing another bull onto the ranch.
  
First Bull: "I've been here five years. I'm not giving this new bull any of my 100 cows."
  
Second Bull: "I've been here three years and have earned my right to 50 cows. I'm keeping all my cows."
  
Third Bull: "I've only been here a year, and so far, you guys have only let me have 10 cows. I may not be as big as you fellows, but I'm keeping all 10 of my cows."
  
Just then an 18-wheeler pulls up in the pasture carrying the biggest bull they've ever seen. At 4,700 pounds, each step he takes strains the steel ramp.
  
First Bull: "I think I can spare a few cows for our new friend."
  
Second Bull: "I actually have too many cows to take care of. I can spare a few. I'm certainly not looking for an argument."
  
They look over at the third bull and find him pawing the dirt, shaking his horns and snorting.
  
First Bull: "Son, don't be foolish -- let him have some of your cows and live to tell about it."
  
Third Bull: "Hell, he can have all my cows. I'm just making sure he knows I'm a bull."

No, just someone who would rather see things as they are and moves on whatever, where up = up and down = down.

No. If crypto were ever widely used (big if) it would definitely not be bitcoin nor one with bitcoin core values/concepts.
