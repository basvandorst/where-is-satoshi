Agreed. Codes don't xfer to a new phone. I had contact each service to disable the 2FA. It took a bit of time, along with passport photo, residency proof, etc. The exchanges I needed it for (Coinbase, Polo, etc) all had procedures in place since this is not an infrequent occurrence.

I wrote a correction and got this reply as part of an upcoming revision:
8.1.2      Bitcoin Cash (BCH or BCC1)
In 2017, Bitcoin users adopted an improvement proposal for Segregated Witness (known as SegWit, where transactions are split into two segments: transactional data, and signature data) through a soft fork. SegWit made it possible to store transactional data in a more efficient form.  However, a group of users had different opinions on how Bitcoin should evolve – and developed a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain titled Bitcoin Cash. Rather than implementing the SegWit changes, the developers of Bitcoin Cash decided to increase the maximum blocksize (additionally the developers made changes to other aspects of the system, such as the difficulty adjustment algorithm). When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
1The ticker used for Bitcoin Cash differs depending on the exchange; some use BCH, some BCC

A lot of interesting replies. 
For me, while bitcoin is not simply an investment and I do not look at it in the traditional sense of a trader. I've bought and sold stocks, indexes, sector funds and rotated in and out as I viewed long and short term trends. But I've never seen anything like bitcoin. It is so much more than an investment, it is a path to freedom. (OK, I admit that I'm a cultist here.) So while I understand the trader mentality of take some profit and run, I see bitcoin as an avenue for freedom. Not just for me, but my descendants. Yes, I agree, it is a gamble. But I play the LONG game. I'm thinking generational here, not next week, next month, next year. If it fails, oh well, I'm still OK. I have enough resources to survive no matter what.
I don't pretend to see the future. But throughout history, the piper must always be paid. Unsustainable debt built on the false Keynesian premise that you can borrow yourself out of debt rules the entire planet. Surely ("please don't call me Shirley") there is no good ending to this. How could there be? Our fiat currency is loaned into existence, with central banksters skimming as best they can. And the debt is ever increasing. There comes a time where debt service exceeds capacity to be met. And then it implodes. It can't be pretty. Many will suffer, unrest will be rampant as promises will not be met.
One poster asked what anti-fragile meant. So I reply, are blocks being confirmed every 10 minutes or so. Has ANY financial network had this much up-time?  Yes, price is manipulated, but the network preservers. I see behind the smoke and mirrors. I see beyond the manipulation. And I see goodness.
I come from a family with a long tradition of being self-employed. Read between the lines if you will. When the SHTF, there will only be you. And what you have that is beyond seizure. While LEAD may trump GOLD, I can't think of anything that trumps crypto.  (OK, maybe a rubber hose).
Stay true to the vision.

Cash out and diversify are always options. My average buy in costs are around $20/coin. So I considered selling some at $100, but held on. In April, 2013, when it went crazy and shot up to $260, I held on, only to watch it deflate back down to $100 for most of 2013. Then, it went hockystick crazy in December, and I got caught up in the "ToTheMoon" fever, only to watch it again crash from the MtGox implosion. 
I stayed on the roller coaster all of 2014, when it rallied back to $650, and when it continued to fall, rallied again, then fell some more, and ending up at around $300. 
Keep in mind that I am self-employed (own my own business), and I am very well paid. I am diversified in cash, stocks, bonds and real estate. I do not need the $. I also had a lot of gold, most of it purchased in the 80's and 90's, when it was under $400 for the most part, and my buying it then was considered a stupid investment by many.  But I knew what fiat was, and I understood that gold was the peoples money. I continued to buy it, even as it peaked at $1800 in 2011, and watched it drop over the next few years. Still, I had it in physical. I could hold it!
I had lost almost 10% of my holdings in inputs.io, in mid 2104. BTC was around $650. I think that that stung me the most, and I kicked myself for not understanding the warning signs that were so clear then, and even more so in hindsight. While I wanted those coins back, but was unwilling to fork over fiat at $600. In early 2015, when BTC was in its doldrums, I decided to sell (actually swap) a chunk of my gold for BTC. I had a lot of miscellaneous gold back then, rubles, helveticas, collectables, commemoratives, etc. So I ended up replacing what I lost in inputs.io and added even more. And I was happy with my BTC holdings, even thought the price languished in the $200's for most of 2015. I believed in its potential.
2016 was a strong year for BTC, with prices moving up a bunch, mostly in anticipation of the halvening. I watched the first halvening, and understood the dynamics of supply and demand, and did not expect an immediate pop. The pop was as the end of 2016.
Now here, in 2017, we shot way up, to far, too fast, in another hockey stick formation. So its drop from the ATH was not unexpected. The "drama" of two coins,potential fork, and the ETF decision helped fuel that drop, and the vitriolic uncertainty has been pretty toxic. 
But I understand, that within this community, that these are rational financial decisions by actors that have big financial interests in mining equipment and mining fees, that are being cloaked in social media propaganda and manipulation. Yet BTC keeps chugging along. A block every 10 minutes. Without fail. anti-fragile.
Sometimes (as others in this thread have observed), I let my ideology lead my financial decisions. I believed in gold, and I believe in BTC, and the concept of crypto-currency as well. And the fear that another crypto will overtake BTC is potentially well founded, especially one that is constructed in such a way as to avoid the mining centralizations that are currently plaguing us. 
But I guess I will hang on a little while more, and see how it plays out.

I've had a long term relationship with my US bank. It's not a big national chain, but it does have 50 or so branches so it's not small either. I've banked with them for 20 years, having two business accounts and a personal account. I know the staff and branch manager and have chatted with them for years whenever I was in the branch making routine deposits, getting bank cheques, etc. 
When I did my first 6 figure withdrawal last summer, I went in and without saying what from, I said that a wire will be crossing into my account that day, and that I was just letting them know. I later used those funds to purchase property. 
Towards the end of 2017, I cashed out &gt; $1 million. Again I told the branch manager this beforehand and had no problem. A few days later, I sat in her office and let her know that even more was coming in. These numbers were far and beyond what I normally transacted. 
So I told her I was an early investor in this thing called bitcoin. She was fascinated and said her son was getting involved and wanted to know my opinion on etherium and other coins. We had a nice discussion. Needless to say I had no problems at all. I made a point of telling her that I was thrilled to pay taxes on my profits and she understood. Meanwhile I continue with my businesses as usual. For me, it was no issue because I had developed a long standing professional relationship with my branch and branch manager. I think it made all the difference.

In about a year, I'll take 10% out and put it into a triple tax free bond fund from Vanguard. This will generate sufficient monthly tax free income for me to live on. I'll report the gain, and when taxes are due the following year, pull out a small amount of additional BTC just to pay the taxes. Report that withdrawal for cap gains agains and rinse and repeat till paid off. The balance of my holding will remain untouched till after 2020.

Figured it out. But it was weird. I wend to my offline copy of bitaddress.org.html and tried to make a new encrypted paper wallet, and it would not encrypt. The circle/wait ball just kept circling. So I went back to my old Dell, sitting on the floor, waiting to be wiped, and the frigging thing decryped!
So, why would a new machine not decrypt, but my old one would? Any ideas?

If I get up to pee in the night, I check the price. I have bitcoinity on one of my browser tabs at all times. I read everything, all the time. Been onboard and hodling since 2012, so I've seen a few of the rise and falls. Never sold, always bought more. 
Tried trading here and there, but wasn't good at it. Lost a few coins on inputs.io. IMO, this is the best game in town. Wild West was never this good.

You might be right. Chrome was used to crypt/decrypt on the old machine, while Firefox is used on the new onel. I haven't yet installed chrome on the new machine, but will do so simply to test this out.
If chrome check out, this raises the question of why does firefox have an issue with the encryption/decryption?
