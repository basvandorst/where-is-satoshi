Thank you, dont forget that it is not about the price of the wallet but about the value that is on the wallet.
A custom engraving and other coin logos etc. are already in the planning stage :)

Thanks for your feedback.
The price is the result of german handwork and the premium quality wood.

Hey guys,
first of all thank you for the feedback. We really appreciated it and took your feedback seriously. With your support we successfully negotiated again with our local manufacturer to lower the production costs. Also we decided to do it nearly without profit to lower the price, because this is our first project an we really want it to be successful.
So we are proud to announce that we can provide the CoinCase now for 99 Euros. This will be our last try, because there will be no more discount, this is the limit of the limit for a product, which is handcrafted in Germany.
Again we would appreciate your feedback. If you are interested check out our kickstarter campaign. [
Also if the campaign will be funded, we want to customize our products, providing you various sorts of wood, different logos, your name engraved and more.
For the context, here is the link to our first post: [

A few months ago we, two students from Germany, asked ourselfes where do people keep their hardware wallets?
Many wallets probably have a high value and are left lying about in the drawer or the shelf.
Even for us little cryptoinvestors this was no solution.
So we decided to develop our own unique case, which represents the wallets value. Just have a look.
For more details check out our kickstarter campaign.
Feel free to give us some feedback!
