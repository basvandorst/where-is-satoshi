Yep. The x axis is the value, y is the time.

It is a sample drawn with a cap of one point each 60 seconds at most, but esentially you can see how the profile of transactions has mover during all the history of bitcoins.
Vertical coordinate is time; horizontal coordinate is log(value), for some transaction output in the sampled minute.

Thanks for the suggestions about rendering; I am now trying to plot the open UTXO only, lets see if I can set better boundaries. 
The round amounts of USD (?) are a funny feature, it means you can actually extract the exchange rfrom the blockchain. Not surprising, but nice to see it.

Well, actually the density is higher today, of course, but yes there are some mistery in the old ages. Note that I have sampled 1 transaction / minute, so in the first year all the transactions are visualized, but then after the online gambling appears it is easy to saturate this limit.
About manipulations: note the top left corner, this last month a lot of very very small payments. Perphaps people bullying the authors of wannacry?

extracted with bitcoin-iterate, a very fast tool in C to read the blocks.  And then to python:
    import matplotlib
    matplotlib.use('Qt4Agg')
    
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    unspent=pd.DataFrame()
    for chunk in pd.read_csv("iterated.gz",header=None,chunksize=1000000):
       chunk=chunk[pd.notnull(chunk[1])]
       intervalo=np.max(chunk[1])-np.min(chunk[1])
       chunk[1]=pd.to_datetime(chunk[1].values,unit='s')
       chunk[2]*=0.00000001
       del chunk[3]
       del chunk[0] 
       unspent=unspent.append(chunk.sample(np.min([chunk.shape[0],1+intervalo/60]))) 
    plt.gcf().set_size_inches(10,32)
    plt.scatter(unspent[2],unspent[1].values,s=0.03,marker='.',color='DarkRed',alpha=0.2)
    plt.xscale("log")
    plt.xlim([0.0000005,500000])
    plt.gca().tick_params(labeltop=True, labelright=True)
    plt.gca().grid(True) 
    
    plt.savefig("test001b.png", format="png", dpi=150, quality=100)

See here the two first years of transactions. The ones in red are still unspent
@_date: 2017-05-21 20:47:19
Most of the patterns told by in the previous graph  do apply here
For this drawing instead of subsampling I have simply used a very low alpha for the points. So it is not so crisp in the early years, but it represents accurately the areas where outputs have not been spent. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:19:14
So not exacly addresses but transaction outputs. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 05:38:31
Yep BTC. So it is funny you can see the fluctuations against dollar.
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:30:07
I would need to detec the USD value from the table, as hinted in the other post. A lot of statistic work.
