@_date: 2017-12-18 17:39:05
wouldn't count on it
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:43:57
i'm a fucking CPA, nothing has changed in terms of taxation. Its a real asset has always been classified that way and when you exchange one real asset for another you are taxed on it. 
Quit freaking people out for no reason you fucking buffoon

@_date: 2017-12-22 19:01:47

1030 isn’t changing, currency for currency has and will continue to be taxable.

Real estate has been free of your "made up rule change" for awhile now. Its called a 1031 like-kind exchange and is the only one that isn't taxable.  Stock for stock, stock for land, etc is all fucking taxable. Please stop posting about shit in which you have no clue 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:11:02
you're probably investing in the wrong asset class 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:37:25
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:09:26
would care you to dig up some IRS tax code to prove this point you're trying to make? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:02:20
this narrative is over used and completely incorrect. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:56:12
dilly dilly 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:00:51
agreed, annoying as hell
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:45:17
This is true for other real assets as well.  If you have X amount of stock and have unrealized gains and buy a house with it you owe tax on the amount even though you bought a house with it. 
Literally no tax rules changed OP just has no idea what he's talking about
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:45:39
OP you have no fucking clue what you're talking about
