This will be my last post on this thread. When you're 65 years old and look back on your life, please feel free to reread my comments and understand how, when the truth was directly in front of you, you completely and utterly missed the significance of anything I said.

[Your point?]( I'm sorry not all people share the same investing intelligence, to the point where it is considered trolling deviating from the mean of value investing. What I'm trying to tell OP is that he should throw literally all of that 15K into Bitcoin and retire in 2025, not diversifying that unbelievable leverage.

Yes, and watch me turn that 500,000 into 10,000,000 in 2 years. The magic trick is to buy and literally hold Bitcoin through just one halving. The hardest part about Bitcoin is the psychology part, most people cannot comprehend the technology and growth potential because they have no relative other asset to compare it to.
The technology is revolutionary, and has jumped 125 billion market capitalization in 5 years because the market is beginning to understand the impact it will have globally. Probably .001% of people on the planet actually own Bitcoin seriously, what happens when that number hits .01% or .1%? The price jumps in orders of magnitude and there's no going back to traditional cash. Think like a stock trader, only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist, the technology is only 10 years old, and 80% of the coins are already in circulation.

Yeah, no. Diversification is for people who don't have a clue about investing. Read what billionaires say about this, Warren Buffet didn't get rich buying index funds. I made 500k on a 50k investment in the stock market without diversifying because I knew the assets I held would exponentially grow.
People who get rich invest in 2-3 assets they know will appreciate in order of magnitudes. They do not eat the opportunity cost of holding cash/index funds, which has a linear growth of near zero.

I did max out my credit cards? 38k in living expenses on credit, credit limit is 39k. I'm not taking loans just yet, waiting to do that on Bitcoin. Right now my credit score tanked after maxing out my cards, so I'm not going to get approved for anything more than a few grand unless I can wait a few months.

We do have the ability to invest with absolute certainty, because the Bitcoin protocol is public and the price can be forecast. There are models such as Stock To Flow that predicted Bitcoin's 10K price in 2010, because  the protocol is constant, predictable, and immutable. There are no assets like Bitcoin because all other assets can have their values changed by exterior forces.
Bitcoin is a deviation from assets like stocks, bonds, precious metal mining, repo lending, swaps, options, cash, index/hedge funds, warrants, etc. All of those things are controlled and correlated to outside forces. Bitcoin is the first asset of its kind that has zero correlation to anything beyond its technology protocol ruled by POW decentralized consensus.
OP should max out his Bitcoin portfolio knowing that he has a first mover's advantage on a new emerging technology that has legitimate exponentially growing scarcity.
