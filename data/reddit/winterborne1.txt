I'm banned permanently as well.  I had my identity stolen, and the thief used my PayPal account to buy a bunch of stuff and racked up a balance.  PayPal came after me for the expenses and even though I provided proof that my identity was stolen, they still wanted me to pay the balance.  I told them I wasn't going to pay it and they'd be better off banning me from their service completely.  They complied with that compromise.  I pretty much hate their company for not helping me with the identity theft issue, but it sucks whenever I'm trying to pay for something online that only accepts PayPal.  I have to beg friends to do it for me, which is embarrassing.

I really don't think ghash.io even wants to be at 51%.  If they succeed, it damages the faith in the currency, which in turn, damages the value of the coins they hold.  They could attempt a double spend, but they'd have to make it really worth it, since the opportunity would be rather short, and it would have to outweigh the benefits of continuing to operate at a sub-50% level with increasing value/bitcoin.

You make excellent points which remind me to be wary of politically-driven conjecture, especially from within the Bitcoin community.  Just because the Federal Reserve suffers from many of the same flaws doesn't mean we should laugh off the points Velde is making.

What's most interesting to me is that this is the same Federal Reserve economist that wrote [Bitcoin: A Primer]( some time ago which seemed to be one of the most comprehensive, yet concise primers illustrating the inner workings of the Bitcoin protocol.

It's actually impossible to "store coins" anywhere.  The coins themselves are just balances attached to a specific key pairing (public/private keys) and ledgered on the blockchain.  I think what you meant to say is that the private keys aren't stored on the phone, they are just accessed via blockchain.info's service which your phone connects to with an identifier and password.  This would contrast with the way a program like Electrum works, where the public and private keys are both localized on your machine (so you can access your private key even when your machine is offline), and the software merely communicates your transactions directly with the Bitcoin network.  Whether this is safer than blockchain.info or not depends on whether you think YOU are better at keeping your private key away from intruders, or if blockchain.info is better at it.
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:04:01
Tried that many times.  No luck so far.  Should I keep crying?
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:49:24
I had an address created using a blockchain.info wallet from years ago and had written down my login info for blockchain.info plus a 15-word mnemonic seed.  When I tried to restore the wallet on Electron Cash using the seed, it ended up with a different address.  Also I had to check BIP-39 in order to get the program to accept the seed.
Back in the day, blockchain.info wallets used to let you see the private keys but when I checked today, I don't see it anymore.  All I have is a 15-word seed and nothing seems to play well with it.  Any ideas?
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:13:52
How would I go about getting the keys from Blockchain.info?  I've been clicking all over the website and while I definitely can see the public key in my wallet, the private key is nowhere to be found, and there doesn't seem to be any publicized way to contact them and ask how to retrieve my private key.

Why even have the die?  What's the problem with just coming up with a number from 1-12 just using your head?  Are we afraid our brains aren't random enough? (genuine question)
@_date: 2015-04-06 19:51:17
That makes sense, but it leads me to a followup question: Should pure randomness be the ultimate goal here?  Or should the goal be in creating a unique key pairing that cannot be discovered by hacking into a device or stealing something from your home, or threatening you with a wrench?  I ask because my brain may not be sufficient to come up with a single random number, but if I'm just sitting next to a calculator, punching in digits left and right and not paying any attention to what numbers I'm choosing, then would that not be an effective way of generating a key pairing that is safe from intruders?

I took my gf to eat at Le Petit Jardin in Los Angeles the other night, which accepts Bitcoin.  Bill came out to 0.09 bitcoin after the tip.  That was probably the largest expenditure of bitcoin I've had yet, even though it was around the same amount of bitcoin I had spent a month prior, buying food delivery through foodler.com.  Spending bitcoin just stings a little bit more when the price is ramping up.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:31:25
It's absolutely nothing like saying that.  Bitcoin has risen 1000% every year since it became a thing.  The Chinese "bubble" put it somewhere over 7000% for Q4 2013 alone.  What OP is saying is, "The 7000% ride was fun, but I'm invested in the 1000% natural growth."  Gambling on the other hand has no natural growth unless you're counting cards in blackjack or playing a bunch of novices in poker.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:47:33
Right.  But when you believe in Bitcoin as a technology and not just as a commodity, you believe its 1000% yearly growth is justified.  Moreover, when you take note of the other innovations currently being built atop the Bitcoin platform, it further justifies future growth.

I don't disagree with you that an overwhelming amount of Bitcoiners have bought in for the purpose of "ending the Fed".  But you also have a population that sees Bitcoin as a way to eliminate compliance costs and a way to instantly transfer value globally.  By all accounts and measures, already-successful companies such as PayPal and Western Union are technologically obsolete, and Bitcoin has already surpassed them in volume.  If remittance were Bitcoin's only purpose, then it should already be considered successful.  But it doesn't end there, does it?  The concept of colored coins still lingers in the wake.  There are already signs of Wall Street preparing to invest loads of money in Bitcoin startups.  Look elsewhere in this subreddit and you'll see fancy new gadgets people are inventing; some are prototypes, others are already being used in the wild.  All the signs are there for future growth.  I'm not one to tell people that Bitcoin cannot fail, but I'll be the first to say the future outlook is more promising today than it was last year.

They could do whatever they want, but they still can't touch your Bitcoin.  For that, you'll always have value to your name.  With dollars, however, they can take your money right out of your bank account, and then raid your home and put you in a cage while they dig up your backyard looking for buried cash.  For what its worth, you're not a tax evader unless you don't pay your taxes.  Bitcoin users aren't tax evaders by default.

$250,000 isn't that much money to some people.  Especially to be one of the first people to take a commercial flight to space.  Some people have already made many times more than $250,000 just by buying into Bitcoin a couple years ago.

I agree with the sentiment of the OP.  However I have to disagree with a lot of the comments about being more intelligent.  They are not more intelligent.  If they were, they wouldn't be spending so much time talking about how they are more intelligent.  The circlejerk is strong in without a doubt.  But I've found that does so much circlejerking about being smarter than it makes the subreddit unbearable to read.  Neither or is the place to go for investment or speculation strategy.  One is always bullish, the other is bullish or bearish with no substantial reasons to state their case.  I prefer visiting because behind all the "everything is always great" mentality, you still have a lot of informative articles and publications here about new innovations and infrastructure.  At this point in the Bitcoin timeline, I care very little about its market price.  I just want to hear about what people are doing within the Bitcoin economy.  I want to hear about new businesses opening up.  I want to hear about Bitcoin ATMs, Trezors, prominent bitcoin figureheads engaging with politicians and bankers, you know...ACTUAL developments.  I've found that this is the subreddit to go to for that sort of material.  I go to if I just want to feel superior to someone else.

There are two aspects of Bitcoin that use cryptography.  There's the hash function algorithm that miners use to create new blocks in the blockchain, and there is the relationship between the private and public keys in the digital signature.

If you're an average user who doesn't take extra measures to protect anonymity, then the government can definitely track your expenditures and uses of Bitcoin.  However, it's even easier for the government to track fiat currency, especially if you're a bank customer.  Moreover, the government can actually directly *take* your fiat currency, while they can't touch your Bitcoin, even if they know you have it.

Does anybody else think that a rise in Bitcoin popularity might lead to a rise in Linux popularity?  When people start governing their own money with their computers, they might end up forcing themselves to learn quite a bit about computer privacy and security.  Personally, Bitcoin has led me to learn about PGP, Yubikeys, Tor, etc., and now I'm ready to use Linux for the first time ever.  Does anybody think that might also happen for "casuals" everywhere if Bitcoin takes off?
