Oh no. What can I possibly do to change your mind. You must be an important person in your own world. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 15:49:58
I forgot for a second who you were. Oh Almighty God of Bitcoin, and infallible master. Of course having a mining majority with enough coin and nodes rebel against small blocks will not possibly lead to anything. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:57:23
Homeschool doesn't count. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 02:02:45
And with majority hash power, nodes, and transactions. What chain would that be?
@_date: 2017-02-05 01:15:12
It's not about SegWit or even a hard-fork. It's about the absolutely disgraceful way that core has treated miners with 100s of million USD invested in the network. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 15:53:22
Bitcoin is far past a stage where we will ever see any form of largely distributed mining power. 
It doesn't matter if ASIC is forked out since the same entities also hold a vast majority of GPU mining power. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:08:34
We know all this. But it's still a stopgap. I would just prefer to roll out SegWit and dynamic block size in some form in a single fork. Especially considering how hard it has proven to be to reach consensus it makes no sense to wait.
@_date: 2017-02-15 22:05:58
What kind of pointless calculation is this? No it doesn't. If you have no equipment, it will cost money to buy it. But you also currently MAKE money mining so how the hell is it a $13 cost? or $1500 an hour?

At least not loser kids. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 14:20:52
Is your argument that they don't deserve to be rewarded for making a massive and extremely risky investment into securing the Bitcoin network? Or are you arguing that they were the only ones who wanted free money and that huge bitxoin holders in the rest of the world were simply too stupid to want free money?
@_date: 2017-02-07 14:10:02
No. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 14:18:30
I'm advocating that the Bitcoin ecosystem works the way it works. The fact that the current situation is not ideal doesn't change that fact. 
If the holders of 100s of millions of USD in Bitcoin that have zero investment in the ecosystem wanted to determine direction they could easily (like it was in 2013) run more hardware securing the network. 
The fact that 2-3 people (a wild fallacy) have massive investments in the ecosystem per default mean that they care more about the future of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 01:07:47
Do you have any ballpark idea of who you are talking about? Outside of the fact that the person in question has almost unlimited access to funds he also has several very large miners committed already. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 12:54:21
Most likely yes. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:26:42
The value of Bitcoin is underpinned by utility and investment in ASIC. A fork with neither quality will simply fall on its own knife. There is no "real Bitcoin" or "true Bitcoin", it's crypto. 
I'd majority of miners representing majority investment mines a chain it will per definition hold value over a fork. 
We can argue all day but nothing changes that. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 15:51:59
Quite a few of the large miners I know hood their profit in Bitcoin and sell only what is needed to make power and infrastructure payments. And quite a few of them good very significant amounts. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 14:28:54
And it would create an altcoin with close to zero network security and no practical value since you can't use "community consensus" against a 51% attack. 
Also worth noting that the same capital that own a majority of Bitcoin hash rate also run the largest GPU farms in the world, so there's that. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:01:50
Ethereum is not even close to a comparison. Learn how Bitcoin works. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 20:28:10
With majority hash power there is no "attack" simply consensus. Seems people are too dumb to remember that the longest chain in the true one. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:56:07
And all of those reasons are perfectly acceptable reasons not to want to activate SegWit. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 22:00:19
You miss the point. Majority hash power forking and spawning enough nodes will create the only working chain. 
Do you think a split chain at current diff with say 10-20% hash power and hour long blocks will have any support?
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:05:12
Choose what. A minority chain with 1 hour blocks and no exchange rate? 
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:14:10
It's quite adorable to pretend that $100 million in ASIC, nodes and capital is somehow "powerless" in the debate. This is the short-sighted anti-China view that has Bitcoin where it is today.

@_date: 2017-02-04 20:29:07

@_date: 2017-02-10 17:29:15
Not at all. They are acting just as the system is intended to allow them to act. The fact that you have a different view doesn't make another view maliscous. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:35:27
Oh.. and how many GPU miners would it take to propagate a block at current difficulty and protect a minority chain from 51% attacks from ASIC? Yeah. No. Try again. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 14:27:31
Seems like a very safe bet as it sits now. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 14:24:01
Of course. But how is that an argument for a certain chain if you hold coins on both chains?
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:56:46
The mining community isn't that large. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 01:16:58

Nothing. It's a comment, it doesn't say anything. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:59:33
In short. No. There is no Proof of work that is functional at scale that would move hash power away from the current hash power leaders, secure the network and be suitable for  the Bitcoin blockchain. 
Trying to move to proof of stake would most likely kill Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 05:37:42
Absolutely. I'm just pointing out that this coin contains "actual Bitcoin". 
@_date: 2017-02-02 14:08:24
That would be a pretty bad AI considering Bitcoin ASIC is useless hardware for anything but SHA256 solving. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:58:05
Except th fact that the people blocking consensus are the ones wanting the hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 01:07:15
Force? Do you think exchanges will list the one with 10 min blocktime and $100s of million in ASIC backing it OR the one with 2 hours blocks and another hard fork to POW planned? 
I welcome SegWit, but some hasty POW fork because they want to disregard mining majority is a terrible idea. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 01:17:34
"the only".. yeah, cause 1+ hour blocks isn't really a big problem... 
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:43:13
And compared to $100+ million in ASIC. How massive of an investment is it for the miners to spin up a few thousand nodes and simply validate the chain with majority hash power?
@_date: 2017-02-05 01:15:54
On Ethereum and IOTA. Not Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 15:50:45
.. someone needs their medication.
@_date: 2017-02-05 14:52:45
Yes. If you hold coin before a chain split, you hold those coin on both chains after a split. Only coin mined or received after the split are chain-bound to a single chain.
@_date: 2017-02-07 01:07:08
Of course not. You can run whatever you want. Doesn't exactly change the network though.

I guess that is a point. I just personally don't see how anyone is going to create a value carrier blockchain that long time survives fighting majority hash rate. 
Short of somehow forking to a GPU algorithm, or a less secure Proof of work.

There is no definition of what benefits Bitcoin. Core supporters believe SegWit does, and big blockers are of a different opinion. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:11:36
Depends on your motives and motivation. But a second fork on a split chain requires an extra fork of course. We shall see what happens. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 02:56:07
I have quite a history of fighting for larger blocks and agree that it's indeed not an either/or argument at all. 
Most "big blockers" (which I personally think is like 'pro lifers' a terrible description of an interest group) aren't arguing against core. 
They/we simply argue that for the sake of the longevity of mining SegWit has to be combined with larger blocks. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:10:23
I think we are all aware of the difference between soft and hard forks. I just think that considering the time to consensus it makes more sense to fork once for dynamic block size and segwit over SegWit first, followed by a hard fork a few years down the line when the risk is equal but the stakes even higher. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 00:56:43
I don't think there is much resistance just to "spite" the core team or SegWit. And the people that hold any power, capital and miners resist core for logical reasons.

Contact Bitlawyer (here on reddit under He's a solid guy, and does escrow etc. I bet he could send a letter without charging an arm and a leg. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 04:47:27
Why would the chains both have anywhere near proportional hash rate if a fork occurrs? The entire concept of a fork is dependent on the chain splitting due to majority hash rate wishing it to split. I doubt the secondary chain would get more than 10-15% of the total hash rate at a split. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 20:27:11
Ha ha. You guys are so adorably delusional if you think Bitcoin would be worth more than $5 if majority of miners jump ship. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:55:22
And how do you magically fork to an alternative algorithm on a SHA256 chain that is split by consensus at a point in time you are not aware of? 
It's not exactly super easy to re-fork with segwit, new algorithm, and new difficulty on a split minority chain with almost no hash power or block propagation at an hour in best case. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 01:34:30

@_date: 2017-02-05 17:56:23
Not true. The market and economy matters, but a chain that doesn't propagate blocks in any form of reasonable timeframe will always lose. Large majority hash power will cause the minority chain to become useless.
@_date: 2017-02-05 14:22:16
Nope. What I am suggesting is that if you make massive investments into securing the network, knowing the rules for now the network works you become arbiter of the asset. 
Didn't seem to be an issue when U.S. miners had a majority 3 years ago.

BitPay is a payment processor. Bitcoin going up or down doesn't make his business rich or poor. Transactions happening does. High volume down or high volume up doesn't matter. Tony also isn't a trader or some kind of price oracle, looking to him for direction on price makes no sense.

Both are needed. You can't indefinitely tweak and improve without also increasing storage size. There is also zero reason to hold on to 1 MB blocks due to moore's law.

No. This hasn't been true before and it won't this time either. What happens is thay miners watch the halving, and if price goes up they keep coming like nothing happened. If price goes down, they sell their equipment and hash rate drops. Either way supply is limited and buy pressure remains the same and price rises. It's a self fulfilling prophecy.

Never understood this. Bitcoin us a $9 BILLION ecosystem. If there is a need for a foundation, hire 5 people at $75k a year and take up donations. If it's the right people there are countless companies, individual and miners that can split the cost. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 14:37:42
Nope. I'll buy at $640-ish thoigh. I think we will have a retrace before halving. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 00:05:49
Sure. If you think more than 25% of the miners is gonna fall out with the stroke of some magic wand, you are crazy.

Most of the answers here are BAD and I'll  tell you why. It completely depends on your circumstances. 1. Do you pay for power? If not, it might very well be a good idea. 2. Do you have easy access to purchasing bitcoin otherwise? 3. What is your outlook on Bitcoin price? I know lots of people have gotten 'burned' from mining and cloud mining, but of course there is a chance of making money from mining. 95TH without power cost for $10k, if you don't think that's a good idea you must be crazy.
@_date: 2016-06-02 12:58:08
I would argue that if it survives 15 years, there are many that will consider it the standard currency. My daughter is 11 and she sees Bitcoin side by side with USD. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 20:12:25
By 'scale' do you mean that it's hard to pay for ice cream? Cause I think I'll rather rifle through some change, than ask my cashier to wait 20 minutes. Don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin for most things. But small physical transactions is not one of them.

Most likely. And it's most likely the creditors running the miners until halving to recoup some of their losses.
@_date: 2016-06-07 20:53:12
Just like it was at the previous halving?
@_date: 2016-06-08 18:52:33
Sure, but does that mean we don't need a block size debate or more improvements. None of the improvements so far "solves" the problem. It just pushes it a little further into the future. I for one don't see the solution as being private sidechain projects. That's not Bitcoin.

It doesn't. But a difficulty increase is a natural effect of more hardware being deployed after or during a price increase as the higher price drives more miners into the ecosystem.

Nope. He really is this bad at grasping the very basics of the network even though he spends his days coding. It's not that LukeJr is stupid, quite the contrary. He just has zero idea of how the bitcoin functions 'in the world' as opposed to his own narrow vision of what it 'should be'.

No shit he does. Snowden has a previous relationship to SpiderOak, and Alan from SpiderOak is on the advisory board of Zcash. If your ultimate goal is JUST privacy, then Zcash is a great idea.

LukeJr has always demonstrated a childlike inability to comprehend the network cost of decentralization and always seem to draw some kind of parallel between node 'hardware cost', block/blockchain size and amount of nodes. Something that anyone over the age of 9 can easily understand is not relevant. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 21:21:37
Nothing of what you just wrote matters, because it's still an unsubstantiated claim. I think you underestimate the amount of trolls and shills on that are paid to slander companies and projects. While you may not be, it's impossible to say. Hence we should all treat anything without evidence as just that. Unsubstantiated. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 01:48:53
Absolutely there is a reason. What it is, I can't figure out. And no, I'm not talking about traditional mixing. I'm talking about payment channels where it is literally impossible to track source. On the way for Bitcoin. Also feels a little like using absolute privacy as the only reason to use something is sort of.. dumb in 99.9% of use cases. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 20:17:41
I agree, we are not at 'internet 1992' yet. But I also think that with the current global architecture, the bitcoin revolution once it starts, will spread faster than the internet did. There is no hardware infrastructure that needs to get built out.
@_date: 2016-06-03 21:07:59
It's not about your motivation. It's about the fact that we should treat accusations without evidence as just that. Even if you aren't lying, there is massive incentive for other companies to spread misinformation about their competition. And if we just take anonymous claims as gospel, we ruin the ecosystem.

I'm far less worried about $0.20 than just a trend of relying on transaction price floating fixing the block size issue. The fact that wallets and exchanges can't keep up with the increasing fees and transactions taking hours is death on wheels for new adoption.

Ok. Core is currently under pressure because there is an urgent need to increase the transaction per second count. One way of doing this is through lightning/SegWit and another is a hard fork for larger blocks. 
If part of the community blocks SegWit then core might have to consider larger blocks as well as SegWit. 
If segwit is activated and relieves the pressure enough the incentive structure may be altered and bigger blocks easier to disregard with a smaller part of the community caring about the other aspects of bigger blocks such as the ability to provide a larger fee pool that sustains mining post reward decrease.

I want both. I am just pointing out that it's not the same as a blockchain increase by hard fork. It's a transaction increase unless the transaction type conforms to SegWit standards (yes it will increase size, just not to 3.7 MB unless transactions follow certain rules). 
This matter for information other than transaction data etc.

The fact that you have to invest $50 in hardware or run a node on a $10/month VPN shouldn't in my opinion restrict growth of the network. 
The fact that you personally want Bitcoin to be something ('digital gold') ar the expensive of mass usability doesn't define Bitcoin that was in fact designed as p2p cash. 
This is also an entirely different debate than whether or not nodes can handle larger blocks. 
Your personal opinion doesn't make anything bullshit. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 16:29:20
I think the question was asked because a lot of people here seems to live under the delusion that SegWit will activate at 'majority' and somehow scale to 95%. No idea where they get this but still.
@_date: 2016-12-10 18:44:10
For so many reasons it's hard to even list them. For starters. Letting miners decide block size (even if that was a thing, which it's not since nodes signal) isn't even illogical since they are the sole investors in securing the network. 
Unless you think running a $30 node is the same as $10 million in mining hardware. 
@_date: 2016-11-27 19:52:21
or not. There are actually sane arguments against allowing SegWit activation without a firm promise of hard fork to larger block size.
Miners understand this because their livelyhood relies on it and SegWit alone jeopardizes this. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 14:59:33
You might be factually correct but this is still a very weak argument. Best case a few core developers basically tried to fool the other party into thinking that core were rolling the fork code into a commit to buy time for SegWit. Highly unethical no matter how you slice it.

PART of core signed HK, which doesn't make it a 'core signed proposal' but something in my view worse. Some core members signed an agreement they knew they were in no position to enforce.

@_date: 2016-11-23 22:51:21
I generally agree that SegWit is good. It just dislike that the proponents of it seem to think that it just "solves everything" calling out anyone that wants both SegWit and big blocks as some form of obstructionist. 
I don't see me or anyone else just not blindly believing core to have zero agenda or pushing for SegWit over larger blocks as hard as they have to be automatically correct.

How do you read that and come to the conclusion that block size increase is in "cores plans"?
The only thing hunting at it is that there "may come a time when something something". Not exactly what anyone who wants larger blocks is looking for. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:00:51

Without timeline or commitment. Sure, it's good that they are reflecting on the 'possible need long-term' but that's a far cry from a commitment. 
You might also note that this is from the same Hong Kong meeting where they have already backtracked their commitment to the miners on this very issue and a year old.

No. It's a transaction volume increase. It does not raise the size of ALL transactions or records, and require transactions to be of a certain type to effectively increase transaction volume.

@_date: 2016-11-29 18:35:06
How is that a comparison. I would argue that a better on is: I want both wheels and a roof on my car. 
The problem most proponents of bigger block size through a fork that changes the block size function is that once SegWit is active and lightning etc. Becomes the "standard" for transactions there is zero guarantee that an actual block size change will happen.
Then you can drive your car in the rain without a roof until your dealership thinks you deserve a roof, cause you already paid for the car.
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:03:54
I am not against SegWit. I am against ONLY SegWit as solution to the scaling issue.
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:04:41
Absolutely, I agree. Just pointing out that core devs have a history of not wanting block size increase, which just makes me more leery of accepting that core would work on solutions to the transaction issue that includes larger block hard fork. 
It does seem I may be wrong and that core is actually at least working towards providing this code as an alternative or in conjunction with segwit. And no one is happier than me if this is happening.

1. Fair point. 2. LukeJr comment history is proof enough. 3. My point is just that once SegWit is established as a defacto standard for smaller transactions the "need" for larger blocks might be relegated to the sidelines. Not taking into account the need for on-chain mining fees as a part of long term viability for mining. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 00:44:38

Unless you are too dumb to realize that's a complete fallacy.
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:01:18
Depends on your view of the bitcoin ecosystem. If you believe you should be able to transfer smaller transactions (NOT micro transactions) under say $5 at a reasonable cost it is. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 20:37:20
You are making a lot of assumptions here. Like that small block supporters are all of a sudden going to start mining on some larger scale, which is not the case currently. 
And yes, while fees will rise 1 MB blocks or even slightly larger might very well cause fees to hit a pain point for users that is still too low to motivate miners.
Obviously none of this is for certain. But it's a distinct possibility that can't be ignored.

@_date: 2016-11-29 15:02:54
What if I told you that supporting SegWit and supporting a hard fork to larger block size aren't mutually exclusive in any respect.
The narrative of that is toxic and dumb. 90% of 'big blockers' want both, just not a rush to SegWit with zero promise of larger blocks as well.
@_date: 2016-11-29 15:07:42
No shit. If this community had any brains they would stop complaining about other people voting with their mining power and actually nut up themselves.

Please don't use "straw man" it just makes anyone using the word seem like they are straight out of My point is obviously not that it's not changing at all. My point is that if we are too scared to possibly do something radical that may result in a price drop, that can hamper evolution. And at this point, in my opinion Bitcoin isn't large or well used enough to warrant that fear. 
Ok, I will buy that I wasn't completely clueless but it certainly was a decent portion luck.

@_date: 2016-11-30 02:23:10
Anything is possible. My personal belief is that once the SegWit proponents realize that they will never reach their 95% goal they will commit to a time table for a hard fork to larger block size and SegWit will pass with this table in place for some fork of on-chain scaling in 2017/2018. 
The end. Everyone happy.

What speed? I am not saying you shouldn't be able to run a node, but to keep growing bitcoin, perhaps hosted solutions is the answer. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 22:53:03
I disagree. There is absolutely a way to scale with block size depending on how you view the evolution of bandwidth and storage. 
Yes I agree that off chain alternatives are a food way and I'm not arguing 100 MB blocks in the near future but I also don't consider side chains or off chain transactions to be nearly as secure or trustworthy as on-chain. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 14:32:01
Because Blockstream has no business model and never hopes to make money. That's why they bankroll core developers.

@_date: 2016-12-20 14:46:18
Here we go again. Someone posts an obviously experimental way of running a full node, and Luke grabs a hold of it as proof that 1 MB blocks are already 'pushing the limits'. Disregarding completely (or not understanding) that OP's solution is a proof of concept and not a recommended general environment. 
Not sure if I should laugh or cry.
I agree that decentralization is desirable but can we stop pretending that hardware and bandwidth are the limiting factors? Do you REALLY think that 100,000s of people would run nodes if they were just less taxing on internet and hardware? Cause that has NEVER been the case, there is NO proof it would happen, and there is ZERO proof that larger blocks would cause the number of nodes to plummet. 
For lack of a better word: You are just pulling random numbers out of your ass a passing them off as 'proof' that large blocks are bad. You can't possibly know anything about this before it's tested and it's exactly as likely that higher usability and bitcoin value as a result of higher TPS would lead to increase in node count despite hardware and bandwidth requirements. FACT!
@_date: 2016-11-25 00:18:21

Seems that protesting and stalling SegWit is working just fine. I don't see us having this debate or work being done on an actual fork to larger blocks without it.

It's not a one way relationship. How hard is this to understand? Without sustainable mining there is no bitcoin, just like there is none without nodes, or without users. 
The entire system is designed the way it is WITH THIS INTENT. This is why consensus is important, for bitcoin to succeed all parts of the ecosystem has to be in consensus.
@_date: 2016-12-14 19:03:10
I think it's quite obvious that there will be several competing blockchains. That said. I would prob estimate that 95% of all altcoins are pointless and will hold no long term value at all.

LukeJr has always been a strong opponent of block size increase. To the point that he argued 1 MB was too large. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 02:21:46
Fact is that bitcoin for all it might have become or is turning into was designed to be peer to peer cash. Not a 1% gold vault of digital asset confirmation. 
I think it can be both, but even the apolitical gold requires larger blocks for on-chain verification even if it should only scale to a tiny fraction of a full transaction network. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 23:40:55
Ah, got the person mixed up. Well, I for some need verification and a less vague roadmap in the light of members of core recently coming out strongly against any block size increase. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 20:53:56

Yes segwit does increase the useable block chain size, but that's hardly the main reason for it. Or at least it wasn't at onset. It also makes lightning a lot easier to run and includes other benefits. 
And yes I agree that it's a good thing. It does however not scale the way dynamic block size would so there are definitely things SegWit doesn't solve long term.

No, the point for Luke is ALWAYS that decentralization at literally ANY cost is better than bigger blocks. He doesn't care if the network is usable at all as long as Hamid on a 14400 BPS modem can run a node on his T81 calculator.

Large miners are holding out for core to make a firm committment on timeline for on-chain block size increase to protect their own interest in the face of the next reward-halving. 
It's really not that strange. With 1 MB blocks there is a risk that fees don't cover cost of mining. They simply want SegWit AND block size increase to ensure that fees keep mining healthy in the future.

Correct, but it does give core a stronger position to continue ignoring hard fork options as it temporarily relieves pressure caused by a small block size increase.

There is no confusion. Transactions through LN or any other sidechain will pay fees to that chain, not directly to miners. Period. That's not even a argument it's a function of how they work. 
There are absolutely models where they can or might choose to pay fees when they use the main chain for commit but it's not even close to guaranteed. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:30:07
But they will be settled as large tranches of transactions (unless I have completely misunderstood LN) and the collective transaction fees will be a fraction of what they had been had they been on-chain separately. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 00:41:45
Idiot comment, from a likely idiot. Also: Is there really an argument that core didn't jump the gun? How dumb do you have to be to put forward a proposal that miners don't want and require 95% commitment for activation? Pretty damn dumb. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 02:25:05
'large margin' of 95%? Oh no. Then maybe read the activation threshold before you look like an idiot.
@_date: 2016-11-30 17:46:49
Ah. Makes sense. Related: what do you think the chances are that we will get a solid statement from core communicating a timeline for a block size hard fork to dynamic or larger block size as a middle road for reaching 95% SegWit in the coming months? 
It seems the dialogue has gotten somewhat more productive lately so it seems like a smart way to go to appease both sides to move on, activate SegWit and start working on a safe and consensus driven hard fork in 2017.
@_date: 2016-12-20 12:39:39

IF you believe that the ramp-up in production will actually happen when you create a double decker bus that has infinite room in it's top compartment. 
This is what the ViaBTC/Core argument is about. Almost no one on the large block side has any real aversion to SegWit as a concept, they just want some form of assurance that bigger blocks will actually happen as well. 
This is also what the entire Hong Kong accord was about. No one is interested in blocking SegWit just cause they don't like the idea, it's about the fact that once SegWit is in place, Core will have no reason to listen to the mining community and provide bigger blocks, or so it seems at least. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 14:25:50
Fitting use case around Bitcoin is a terrible idea compared to evolving the blockchain to fit use cases. Bitcoin isn't a mature business waiting for customers, it's a start up looking for a killer app. 
That kind of thinking WILL kill bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:10:35
No one is really concerned about fees/rewards for the time being. The concern is if a large amount of transactions move to lightning and mining reward is halved. Larger on-chain blocks would guarantee larger on-chain usage and higher fee pool for miners down the road.

Read up on SegWit and how the block space is used. A 3.7 MB theoretical limit for SegWit blocks is not the same as 3.7 MB of current block space. 
Segwit about doubles (at widespread usage) block size, and allows certain types of transactions if used to reach around 3.7 MB

If you look at history and general trend it doesn't matter much if you long BTC or Alts. I believe Bitcoin will outperform general altcoins as an index, but vs. Fiat both are a better position.
Remember, alts don't have to fail for bitcoin to succeed. We are all in the same boat (except for scamcoins. That boat can suck it!)
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:30:21
Ok. Here goes:
1. SegWit 'solves' (if it works as intended) the transaction per second issue for everyone that is fine with off-chain transaction propagation.
2. It also gives us some breathing room in general capacity for certain types of on-chain transactions. 
3. However, in doing this it also siphons transaction fees from on-chain transactions since off-chain (lightning etc.) transactions do not pay transaction fees to miners.
4. It is an entirely likely scenario that Lightning becomes popular enough that a majority of transactions happen 'off chain', possibly decreasing or stabilizing on-chain transactions fees at a level where mining may not be profitable after say one more mining-reward decrease.
5. This would decrease security of the bitcoin blockchain as miners fall off due to inability to mine profitably. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:15:13
How do people think this is so unlikely? If they were banking on (pun intended) larger blocks to facilitate more data in on-chain transactions their entire model might very well be broken by SegWit. 
SegWit isn't the same as on-chain scaling, especially for a large consortium who might be attracted to bitcoin purely for it's distributed on-chain security and immutability.
@_date: 2016-12-11 17:13:21

SegWit is NOT a simple straightforward solution. It's a stopgap that moves transactions from on-chain. 
In my opinion we need both, and the fact that core focused to heavily of SegWit is a huge weakness.
@_date: 2016-11-24 23:54:02

@_date: 2016-11-23 23:37:27
Ok. It won't "siphon" fees. But it will accept fees for transactions that occur outside of the Bitcoin block chain for the purpose of paying miners. 
And yes, if is likely that fees will rise. However, it is not a certainty that the system will work in a way that compensates the miners the same way as an increased number of on chain transactions would. 
This is why larger blocks is necessary together with alternate solutions such as SegWit.

@_date: 2016-12-08 14:05:10
No large miner relies on Roger Ver as their only source of information. This stupidity has to stop. Large miners simply want a firm timeline on on-chain scaling because they are worried that SegWit will cause issues down the road when mining reward halves and 1 MB blocks possibly do not provide enough transaction fees to sustain a healthy mining revenue. It's really not rocket science.
That said, core has been moving in the right direction lately and I expect that once they commit to scaling block size through a future non-contested hardfork miners will vote SegWit through. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:19:35
Almost completely different issues. A GPU/CPU relies on a nearly 100% functionality of gates on chip while an ASIC can run just fine with 2-3% up to 20% of all gates dead. It's FAR easier to tape out functional chips for ASIC than anything else due to this.

1. Core went back on the Hong Kong accord that included provisions for block size increase
2. LukeJr among others have expressed in no uncertain terms that they are against a block size increase
3. It might not be harder to fork post SegWit, but what incentive does core have to do so when they are already against it? The ONLY hope for a hard fork to larger block size that guarantees just that is to force Core's hand to increase block size before SegWit.

I don't think anyone is really saying "let's push though a contested fork right now". Even Viabtc etc. Are stalling SegWit to bring core to the table for a roadmap that clearly contains a hard fork, not to realistically fork the network in the next few months.

I think you are wildly mixing two arguments. 
Pretty much 'everyone' agrees that it's urgent to increase transaction capacity. The debate isn't 'should we' but 'how'. 
SegWit does this in a way, which is great. The issue that some (me included) have with it is that it does so without any concern for miners (I have described a worst case scenario before). 
I love SegWit, and would like to see it pass. However, without a firm commitment to on-chain scaling I think it's very 'risky' to trust that core will follow through and actually work on on-chain scaling after SegWit is passed. 
Hence the 'mexican standoff' between SegWit supporters and supporters of hard fork to bigger blocksize. Not saying you can't be both, I am.

I generally agree with your assessment outside of the adoption rate of SegWit. If you subtract BU and Classic signaling SegWit has already reached about half (roughly) of the 'other', and in short time. 
Remember there are probably another 10-20% that run nodes but simply don't follow the community closely enough to 'notice' a need for upgrade yet. 
I think as a whole the transaction volume increase issue is of the greatest urgency and importance to the active community.

Honestly, the thing I like the least about and is the childish viewpoint that just because you don't agree someone has to be 'wrong'. 
The bitcoin ecosystem isn't a cohesive single cell organism. Miners will to some extent have different priorities than investors, investor different view than users, users different than Node operators etc. It's just how the ecosystem works.

Pointing to market price in an asset on it's third hard fork that was overvalued wildly to begin with is a genuinely idiotic idea to try to show 'how a hard fork can go wrong'.

@_date: 2016-12-08 19:21:50
Not 4 MB unrestricted space though. But it does double capacity.
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:50:10
Not at all. Of course the ability to choose payment channel is great, and so is segwit. My point is just that it also allows explosive growths that does not benefit miners directly. 
I'm not saying "cripple the network to pay miners". 
I'm saying "make sure to keep on-chain fees in mind when making decisions since miners are a necessary part of the ecosystem and securing the network". 
SegWit and for example lightning will be great but they fact that lightning fees do not directly contribute to mining rewards is something that has to be considered as blow reward diminishes. 
And yes, I should have noted 2MB and not one. That is my fault, segwit does double block size so that's good and will work as a stopgap. 
That's all. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:06:07
Agreed. There is however quite a bit of 'gray area' between just keeping 1MB blocks and pushing all other transactions to off-chain, or combining larger scaling blocks with off-chain alternatives. 
I personally would like to see dynamic block size AND SegWit as a solution that allows medium-sized transactions to be feasible on-chain at a fee that isn't prohibitive and pays miners for their work  at the same time as microtransactions can take place on Lightning etc. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 15:09:58
You might want to check with the core team again. Nothing currently hints that they are working on anything related to a hard fork. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 00:31:54
It shouldn't have. A roadmap based on vague wording and without timeline isn't a roadmap. 
The above leaves plenty of room for core to simply stall indefinitely using sidechains and claim that there 'just isn't a need right now' while miners dry up due to income loss. 
All people that are looking for larger blocks want is a commitment to it. 
@_date: 2016-11-27 18:12:16
Absolutely. But if you want to improve the network the two (will of the community) and the will of the developer group is bound to follow pretty closely over time if they expect to move Bitcoin forward.

@_date: 2016-11-23 22:57:22
It matters because miners in a near future will rely on transaction fee income for profitable mining and if the amount of on chain transactions is low, we may hit a point where no one wants to pay the high fees for on chain transactions. (Assuming existence of side chains to handle them).
This could (not saying will) lead to lower hash rate, and a weaker block chain. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 00:06:29

The Bitcoin ecosystem can retool for any other Crypto faster than you would ever imagine. There is no 'too big to fail' in crypto. If users move on, they move fast.
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:44:59
Lightning can indeed offload transactions from on-chain. But it also comes at a cost since those transactions won't share their fees with miners.
I am also not sure that this idea that Bitcoin on-chain transactions should only be for large transactions and high fee is something that everyone agrees with. It just seems to be some default belief among small block supporters. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 02:20:20
Of course it comes across as petulant. But you can't deny that it has had an effect. There is now an actual conversation about block size outside of random yelling and bans, and it seems core are coming around on the idea instead of random core developers arguing that it will never happen and that Ver is just some kind of 'blockchain terrorist'. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 14:46:08
And if you think 11 months is time that bitcoin has to just sit around with 1 MB blocks and mempool out of control you are truly a 'special' kind of optimist. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 01:50:05
All I want is for cars (transactions) that pay a higher fee to be included before others to be faster and honk at other blocks when they pass.
Make it happen. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:01:04
This isn't a valid opinion. People that actually understand how money moves quickly realize that 'token value' is almost irrelevant to fungibility and an electronic currencies ability to move value. 
If I have $100 FIAT, and wants to move it to China using Bitcoin. The Bitcoin price is 100% irrelevant if I instantly convert to BTC, and someone in China converts to Yuan within say an hour of my transaction. 
Bitcoin can be worth $1 million each, and it doesn't make a lick of difference to the transaction.
Yes, you can argue that 'no one wants to sell Bitcoin if it keeps going up' but that's irrelevant as well as long as there is a portion of coin available for movement.
@_date: 2016-11-29 13:03:54

I am not at all fundamentally against SegWit, I think it's brilliant. I just think that many people are missing the fact that it does siphon fees from main chain and that it doesn't 'solve' the block size issue.
@_date: 2016-11-29 00:35:48
I don't consider SegWit to be a 'block size increase' proper. Yes it increases the transaction volume that a block can handle but it is not the same thing as a hard fork to larger blocks. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:45:03
Have you tried not being part of a community that bashed every single fiat to BTC service for the last 2 years? 
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:04:24
I agree. But the fact that there is an issue points to a larger problem related to how core communicates.
@_date: 2016-12-05 20:20:16
Hah. Damn kid. You can't even stay on topic. How the hell is anyone supposed to have a conversation with your autistic self. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 14:54:20
And none of the measures currently being front runners deals with on chain scaling or fees.
@_date: 2016-12-03 13:27:48
That core developers obviously are passionate, possess in general very deep understanding of the technical aspects of bitcoin, and have a vision for how they propose scaling is best handled. 
Even if I personally disagree, and would like to see a timeline set where SegWit activation is followed by development, testing, immediate proposal and implementation of code that allows for a high consensus hard fork to dynamic block size. 
I think the "Core (or UL for that matter) are out to destroy bitcoin because they work for 'X' or are part of 'agency X'' are simply conspiracy theories dreamed up by people that can't grasp that smart people can have different views on how to solve a problem without it being a conspiracy.
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:12:51
"fuck cooinbase and circle for acting like banks, fuck their customer service for being slow, fuck their fees" two weeks later "baby come back". Yeah. Have fun with that. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 22:55:38
Good points. Though I would argue that miners actually can stall Segwit indefinitely unless core drops the threshold for activation to contested levels. 
That said. I think the latest development where core actually has (it seems) made some concession to start looking more seriously at not only SegWit but also block size increase is a very good sign. 
Something that may not have happened had there not been a lively debate regarding the issue. 
So perhaps the system does work. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:02:39
"more profit" you act like miners are just sitting on a beach watching money flow in. 
You realize that a lot of large miners were sweating at breakeven on million dollar investments at halving, and will do so again next halving. 
The fact that they currently are making a healthy profit doesn't reflect that a lot of then went bankrupt when Bitcoin hit $250 last. 
And as far as "good riddance" you have to be pretty dense to think Bitcoin would survive a halving where 50%+ of all miners leave the network. 
Cause it wouldn't.

And saying that there are no small blockers is simply not true. There are several core members that are even arguing that 1 MB blocks are too big for 'proper decentralization' and that blocks really should be smaller. 
It's entirely possible that SegWit without larger blocks lead to miners not being able to mine at a profit when miner reward drops again, it's the entire reason why so many miners support larger blocks as priority effort.

@_date: 2016-12-14 14:17:04
The point is that miners interest intersect with the interest of Bitcoin. Without successful Bitcoin there is no profitable mining. 
Saying it isnt is like saying that "you can't put the power of auto makers in the hands of shareholders". Why? Cause destroying your ecosystem and source of income is good for any part of your business?
Only an idiot thinks that miners somehow are "out to destroy" Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 13:31:34
1. Miners are needed in POW. 'concern for miners' isn't about treating them like some privileged species but simply realizing that for the system to function miners who have invested $100+ million in hardware are a group that has to have a 'say' in the future of bitcoin since they are a part of it.
2. OK, I can buy that but hard fork to larger or dynamic block size is still different from SegWit etc.

This isn't a roadmap. It's a vague and worthless way of getting around committing to a block size increase.

@_date: 2016-11-24 02:16:16
If you bother to actually follow the argument no SegWit itself doesn't, but it enables easier use of Lightning etc. That does indeed not directly contributes fees to miners. 
And I seriously doubt anyone would be super excited about SegWit alone was it not for it making lightning etc. Easier to integrate.

There is VASTLY more bitcoin mining than litecoin in China. Core was caught trying to misrepresent blocksize increase at the HK conference (only a few members signed the agreement, but it was still shady). Only very recently have core accepted the fact that the community wants both SegWit AND blocksize increase. This is a direct effect of ViaBTC etc. blocking SegWit activation so I support the big-blockers fully in this. Otherwise we would likely have had SegWit and NO plans for blocksize increase. That's not even debatable in my mind.
@_date: 2016-11-29 00:26:41

I'm not sure I am buying that argument at all. 95% was a limit set for activation by core themselves, dipping under that for activation no matter the reasoning would likely be a pretty big deal. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:15:31
I agree, but I have to also point out that core made a HUGE error in judgement when they assumed SegWit would pass 95% after they knew good and well that the mining community were unhappy with being ignored in their requests for a form timeline towards on-chain scaling.
They are technically brilliant, and dedicated people but I get the impression they are simply out of touch with a large portion of the community represented by large companies and huge investment in mining equipment. 
Don't be Betamax. Sometimes you have to listen to the market even if you are convinced your solution is the most technically proficient one. 
That said, I support SegWit, but am also of the view that it has to be combined with a firm commitment and timeline towards on-chain scaling to activate. 
Like it or not, miners have 100s of milions of USD invested in securing the network for a fee, and you can't just ignore them. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 15:48:39
Seeing causation due to correlation isn't sound. Ever. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 00:33:03
It's like a coal plant with zero emission, that is allowed to set fees according to consumer demand. So... what's the problem? And what' power' does it give miners that they don't already have? 
None of that is an argument for 1 MB blocks, or even close. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 20:44:40
Not if you throttle it correctly. And well, if that's still the case. Maybe not run a node.

Agreed. And for what it's worth, I don't believe that 10MB blocks is viable for most nodes as of now. 
I simply think it's an interesting conundrum whether or not to move forward with scaling the network OR cater to lowest common denominator. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:09:26
It's very simple. 
SegWit, while a good idea (I support it, more on this later) will cause transaction fees through lightning etc. to run on a separate channel to a large extent not benefiting miners. 
This is fine, but for the blockchain to have a maximum chance of sustaining profitable mining over the next and following reward halving this has to be combined with on-chain scaling. 
Large miners want a guarantee that SegWit is followed by on-chain scaling and so far core has been unwilling to make this commitment. 
That's it. In a nutshell: Miners are worried that once SegWit activates transactions will move to off-chain (for all intents and purposes) channels and fees will no longer be able to sustain mining once reward decreases. 
It's not a conspiracy, it's just different parts of the ecosystem with different priorities. Natural and healthy.

Oh look. The 13 year old COD player showed up to spread his wisdom.

Oh no. Please scold me, nameless cutie blowing SegWit like the antidode is in it. We can't all be thesilentwitless

Well, REP is a token not a coin. But good luck on your no doubt deep research.

That's great if true. Would never have expected him to actually contribute to a possibly larger block size considering his historical opinion on the matter. Respect to for this if true.

TLDR: Instead of evolving bitcoin as per Satoshi's white paper or years of consensus here are some half-decent ideas of how we could work around it. 
Why? If you get a flat tire, you change the tire. Filling it with rags or driving using a round piece of wood stapled to your rim just isn't as good of a solution. That's why most people don't do it.
@_date: 2016-12-19 13:52:06
No. Decentralization is a priority of the network in YOUR opinion. There are plenty of people who believe that scaling is a bigger issue than decentralization. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 13:48:44
Absolutely agree. It's a principle issue where the question is whether or not to take into consideration those who wish to run nodes in areas with sub-standard internet coverage or not. 
I know what you are talking about. There are many areas in the U.S. with 'developing nation' internet. 
That said, what should we do about it? Cater to lowest common denominator or move forward towards scaling without those who do not have access to 'western standard' internet access. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 22:36:51
FACT: Not really in a real way unless you have to upgrade internet. Hard drive space is dirt cheap.
FACT: Well, supply. But yes.
FACT: There is no reward today is there?
No. It's not digital cash if you can't use it as cash.

Seems everyone here are happy to gloat every time Ethereum has an issue. Completely missing the point that Ethereum is failing forward while bitcoin is standing still. 
Not like we have any examples of large entities being passed by smaller and more agile projects. Phew

The amount of jealous-dumb here is at unacceptable levels. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 03:38:21
I can't say I'm happy with it. But I also don't have a magic solution. I do think it will resolve in the next 3-6 months in some way.  Everyone has a pain point and no one wants to see Bitcoin fail due to innovation loss. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 14:03:03
And why should anyone care about that? You just come off as childish in your continuous rants against anything that questions SegWit.
@_date: 2016-12-14 18:31:34
Not even close. Unless you believe there will ever only be a single useful block chain. Like.. literally no other service or product ever in the history of man.
@_date: 2016-11-28 05:52:51
No miners, no Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 17:34:46
Agreed. But due to the community split on the small/large block issue literally the only core members that get any coverage are the extremists. 
Core really needs to figure out how to communicate like they actually have a roadmap, and aren't just 3 people with the most radical views.

Natural growth contain bursts from time to time, doesn't mean it's spam attacks. Even if it contains spam that doesn't mean we won't have massive issues next price rally or deflation.

There is no 'floodgate' for hard forks. Block size size is a very specific issue that has been debated for years
. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 14:02:26
I fail to see how this is strange? He complains that core hasn't been willing to listen to the Bitcoin business community. A claim fairly easily verified. How is this not a standpoint to understand?
@_date: 2016-12-08 16:41:12
Agreed. That's why I described it as history. Core has indeed come around to doing serious research and moving in a more miner friendly direction as of late. 
And yes, segwit is to a certain extent on chain scaling. However, only to about 2 MB for all transaction types.

LukeJr is defined by his down need for personal greatness and religious fanaticism. To this day, I have never heard him admit being wrong about anything ever. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:03:06
Yeah, that's not how it works. Simply because on-chain and off-chain isn't the same thing. 
It's like arguing that PayPal solves credit card fees.

They tested signaling, they didn't mine using it. Check your facts.

It's not a secret advantage, it's just that they don't care about their capital cost in Fiat since they can't move the money out of the country. OTC trades for large amounts of Bitcoin in China is at a crazy premium over market price.

I completely disagree. The difference in price/GH and Watt/GH between S7LN and S9 isn't that great at all. 
@_date: 2016-05-31 15:18:30
The S7LN is pretty sweet.
@_date: 2016-05-31 13:25:01
Outside of the power efficiency the S7ln is actually a better purchase. 
@_date: 2016-05-31 15:28:41
Of course, that's what I meant with 'Outside of the power efficiency". Problem for me being that I really don't want to run a 1300W Jet Engine in my house :)

The only thing you can be sure of is that ALL crypto casino's are more of less a scam. 10 miles of fine print, and withdrawal problems galore.

Virtually no risk of that since you have about 20 years

Bitmain generally sell above calculated break even for miners.
