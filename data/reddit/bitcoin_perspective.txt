To be fair, no one outside of here wonders why it's called a cult.  Only people inside the cult see it as anything else.

I have to disagree.
Bitcoin has been INCREDIBLY successful in being a window into that horrible libertarian hellscape.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:10:14
And if you'll direct your attention to this thread, we see our "future wealthy elite" begin to tear each other apart when they realize the horrible truth:  a speculative bubble cannot last forever.

Yeah, there are absolutely no systems in place to prevent, nor rectify fraud with credit cards.  
Unlike bitcoin, which is fraud proof and offers no way of a someone using your funds without your permission as well as simple and effective reversals of transactions if through some miracle you were a victim of fraud.

My favorite part is that they're dividing into sub-factions of "this is all a bullshit article" vs. "He needs our protection" vs. "He's a front man for the REAL Satoshi."

"2014 is the year of Bitcoin"

Seems to me the sad ones are those who honestly believe that they're going to be the new global 1% because they either left their computers on for months and months or bought internet fairy dust when it was "cheap."
And then posting threads about "owning" someone for an incredibly technical misstatement.
There are a lot more sad people on than the few you decided to mention.

@_date: 2014-02-24 19:09:11
1. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins.
2. Satoshi personally holds nearly a million of them.
I guess my question is:  if bitcoin became the world's de facto currency, is this okay with everyone?  Because it seems like a fairly ridiculous idea to let 1 person control nearly 5% of the world's currency.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:28:01
Well, the rumor is that 3/4 of a million bitcoins were stolen from Mt. Gox.  
Which was the biggest and most well-known exchange.  People's coins are gone, and their dollars are probably gone, too.  The thinking is probably along the lines of "if it could happen to the biggest exchange, it could happen to any of them!"
Speculators have been propping the price up, and they've lost their confidence that bitcoin will make them rich.  They're out.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:45:31
I'm not sure all of these calls to make this journalist feel unsafe by posting her personal information online for daring to "out" this guy are going to get rid of the perception that bitcoin is a creepy cult.

Yeah, the multiple posts calling Satoshi a "savior" and re-reading everything he's written, then marveling at its greatness is NOTHING like a creepy cult reading its glorious leader's words and swooning at the mere mention of his name.  Nope, not at all...

To be honest, this scenario has never come up, and the odds that it will are pretty much zero.
I have no use for bitcoin.  It offers me nothing that I can't get anywhere else.  That may change, but the odds are against it.  I suspect that there are plenty of companies working on solutions for my possible internet commerce needs that don't involve me having to exchange my USD.
Good luck with your 50 cent bitcoin tips.

@_date: 2014-03-30 22:56:01
I understand the technology and find it very impressive.  If bitcoin had truly stayed "the currency of the internet," I could have easily been using it today.  It's a great way around the scary world of spending money on the web.
Then two groups of people got involved and absolutely ruined the whole thing:
1) The libertarians/Anarcho-capitalists, who decided that bitcoin was destined for something much bigger than a great way to consolidate microsoft points/ facebook bucks/ etc.  No, bitcoins were going to become the de-facto currency of the planet, and take down central banking, and usher in a golden age of "breaking out of the shackles of the oppressors!"  Despite all the incredibly obvious problems with bitcoin becoming a world currency, they started using it to further their agenda.
2) Speculators.  As soon as bitcoin became "worth" more than a few pennies, folks started seeing a get-rich-quick scheme worthy of the 21st century.  Suddenly, a group with a vested interest in bitcoin's "success" had a major voice in the conversation.  Their goals aligned a bit with the libertarians, in that if bitcoin became the single world currency, they'd become rich, by the limited number of bitcoins.  "Up, Up, Up!" and "To the moon!" became substitutes for actual conversation.
Together and separately, these two groups have turned a pretty neat idea into a frankenstein's monster that brings out the absolute worst in the absolute worst people.  Neither group wants to address any problems with bitcoin, or admit that it being the first crypto doesn't mean it'll be the best or most successful.  All they serve is their agendas.
The funniest thing is that dogecoin, a coin based on a ridiculous dog meme, actually might be the crypto that comes out as an actual success.  No cap on the number of coins that will be created makes it pretty much useless to both of these groups, so it's become a neat way to exchange value over the internet without being the libertarian hammer of change/ my ticket to living on a yacht for the rest of my life.

Because it's not a good investment.  After every one of these drops in price since the 1st of the year, this sub has been filled with cries of  "cheap coins!" and "now's a good time to buy!"  SO FAR, these have been off base (obviously that may change). 
If you expect bitcoin prices to rise, you have to ask yourself why.   Merchant adoption has yet to move the price upwards.  Instead, the downward trend has continued.  Despite all of the "good news," for bitcoin, as an investment, bitcoin has been steadily losing its value.  
If you're investing based on faith, it's really not all that different than playing the lottery, is it?  You have a complete unknown outcome, but "know" in your heart of hearts that you're going to come out on top.   If that's enough for you to invest $11k, you should go for it.
