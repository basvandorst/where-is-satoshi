Yeah, I mean in general, not just CSW. Even if the real Satoshi came forward and signed a message with the private key it won't be good enough. All Satoshis are fake Satoshis.

Wealth distribution has nothing to do with decentralization in a PoW cryptocurrency. Mining centralization is the main concern with Bitcoin.

That proves he has access to the private keys. Not that he is Satoshi.

An anonymous snake whose only contribution is co-owning bitcoin domains? Yeah okay.

How is creating an API key suspicious activity? They were just collecting credentials for months and as soon as they decided to do something irregular with them, red flags popped up and they were dealt with.
Also you're just speculating the amount of phished accounts. With 5+ million user base they'd need quite a lot of accounts to be classed as a "very wide scale". Doubtful they had many, so there is nothing really note worthy about API keys being created on that sort of scale over the period of months.

Obviously not going to check them all, but I just went down the list and spam clicked random ones and they're all right for me. Don't know what you're talking about.
Also I don't own the site, merely sharing it with everyone.

That is not even the post in question. This is the post on satoshi's original p2p foundation account.
Althought it is debatable still if it was him or not as some people claim the account has been compromised in the time between 2011 and 2014 when it was posted.
