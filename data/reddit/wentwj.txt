There's a lot of problems bitcoin needs to solve, but supply isn't one of them. Transaction times and fees need to come down, but because bitcoin is dividable I don't see why a drastic increase in supply is needed. If anything the increasing price increases the usable supply of bitcoin, as smaller divisions are now 'useable' currency. Making the biggest issue in my mind the fee and transaction time, because that's what's keep smaller increments from become 'usable' currency and capping the price

under new tax law those will no longer be like-kind exchanges. But I believe that won't go into affect until 2018
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:53:18
it made the rounds after the tax law was passed, this is just a random google of "bitcoin tax law like kind". The like kind exchange was clarified in the new tax law to only be real estate

So you basically have a wallet on each exchange, and a local wallet.  You can transfer from the exchange to your local, but presumably some people have money on wallets on mtgox?  Could you transfer btc off your mtgox wallet right now, or is that frozen too?  
People keep talking about what people will do when mtgox reopens, and I guess I'm just wondering if something is actually preventing those people from doing the same thing at other exchanges right now.

... and then later have to tell them that it has only stayed at a flat value.

mtgox is down, not processing orders.  Bitstamp is down, everything else is crashing.

If you somehow think this crash is going to be spun into a positive because of "high volumes" you're wrong.  This came at the worst possible time.  Over the last few weeks there's been a LOT of legitimate interest in bitcoin, however the detractors argued that it was volatile, over-valued and possibly susceptible to attack.
The fact that it crashes down, several exchanges all collapse all possibly over an attack, is just going to confirm the fears any legitimate investors/vendors had about it, and scare people away from the platform.
I like the concept of a crypto-currency in theory, I was even considering buying in at bitcoin when it inevitably came down from it's crazy $200 value, but the way in which this crash happens, maybe severe enough to permanently damage bitcoin itself.  If not permanently, than at least for a long time.

I agree that a  DDoS attack doesn't make sense from someone investing. Each time the chance of an immediate recovery sinks.  I don't buy big banks either.  Bitcoin is so far away from being useful, and despite the doom and gloom talk here, I don't really see why a bank would much care if it dealt in Bitcoin vs any other currency.
Assuming a DDoS is happening, I'd be more willing to believe it was someone trying to extort the exchanges.

The consensus seems to be an attack.  I'm still not 100% convinced it isn't just high volume.  A lot of people started watching bitcoin (myself included) during the build up, and especially when the crash started.  Logically as one exchange goes down, the others would probably experience further load potentially causing a domino effect.
Without seeing server logs it's hard to say if it's a real DDoS or if it feels like one simply because of the huge traffic.  Neither case would really surprise me.

I've seen some graphs, that if true, do suggest a DDoS, but originally I assumed it was increased traffic.  Not new users in the last two days, but a slow build up of new users, which rapidly drove the price up to 266, then as soon as one started selling, they all sold in a firesale, hence the major price drop.
Even if a DDoS is happening, the price a few days ago was insane, given Bitcoins current state of being an investment, and not a legitimate currency, the $266 price was unwarranted.

I'm really curious if there's really a DDoS going on at this point.  This reasoning you're providing makes zero sense.  A DDoS attack only makes sense if it was done very quickly, to tank the price so they can get in low and have it spike back up.  At this point they risk doing permanent damage to bitcoin tanking it lower.
Not being aware of the actual server issues, I'd be inclined to think it's just a significantly higher traffic than any of these sites have ever seen.  Due to the boom, and then the insane interest surrounding the crash
