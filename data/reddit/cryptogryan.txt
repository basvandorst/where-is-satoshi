I think this is an important question to contemplate. Back when segwit2x was still a thing and it looked like it might fork with majority hashpower, many people caveated saying that it was only the longest *valid* chain that mattered. I still buy this definition more than "longest chain" because I don't want any miners to fork to a bitcoin variant that increases the total coin supply, or whatever other consensus changes might seem appealing.
Ultimately, I feel that the real decider is where the economic supermajority ends up. Now is a super weird time with BTC dominance so low. I expect that in the long run there will be one clear winner, but I'm not holding my breath. The market can remain irrational far longer than I can remain solvent.

To be fair, Lightning doesn't require segwit -- any fix to transactional malleability will do (as I understand it). Of course, BCH has no implemented or planned fixes for transaction malleability, so it does indeed appear that they're putting all their eggs in the "bigger blocks" basket for now.

R selection refers to a species that has many children and provides very little care for each child (for example, a turtle). K selection is a species  that has few children but puts a lot of energy into each one (for example, a whale): 
The idea in the comment, as I understand it, is that BTC is like k selection: a small block size with lots of work on making the coin usable in other ways (segwit, lightning, etc), whereas BCH is r-selected (large block sizes and little care to other scaling methods).
