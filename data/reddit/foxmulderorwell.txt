bitcoin was at it's highest with the most memes...
less memes now and look at what bitcoin is doing. 
coincidence? i think not

i have mutual funds... so yes i am invested in these.


so your advice is put you money into something that has no backup insurance, is untested, basically gambling, and where you could lose everything you put in....
that's your advice? stay away from banks, because you were dumb once, and put it all into crypto...?

"However... if I were to lose the ball, which is less likely than if you were in charge of the ball, the government would give me/you a new one. Also if you give the ball to Timmy instead of me, he won't charge you a monthly fee, or a fee when you want it back, you can basically use it free of charge. We also have other balls you can borrow should you want more than 1 ball. We will charge you for that, but not for holding onto your personal ball"
Guys.... banks have there purpose/role. and a good and important one at that. If your "bank" charges you money to get your money out or to keep it there every month. Than your a damn idiot. There are numerous banks and credit unions that do not charge any fees for standard checking and savings accounts.
don't be dumb

no overdraft fees is penalizing idiots who say they have the cash for something and try to buy it, when they really don't....
overdraft fees are for liars and/or idiots
@_date: 2018-05-09 20:34:29
and the ball is difficult to sleep on under my mattress/can burn during a fire.... and sometimes you need balls that to be a certain brand and style and not the new fancy balls, because sometimes you can't use the new fancy ones at certain places.
and if i put all my balls in one egg basket(crypto)... well we know not to put everything in egg baskets.
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:11:36
it's perfectly fair... and even if it isn't, welcome to life, life isn't fair

Which means in January the loss was worth about $261,352.58....
which means in 10 years it will be easily worth 1,338,210.53....

all the people bitching about the "bribe" and "fucking" over others....
have you ever ordered anything by mail? ever have it come quicker than 5 days/ 2 day/ overnight?
you paid for it get to you quicker than those who ordered theirs before you, why weren't you a piece of shit then, but OP is now? it's the same damn thing
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:00:03
it's cool. but...
how long before "skimmer" type devices get put in on those?
plus the fees are ridiculous
@_date: 2018-05-09 20:44:30


 because you don't want me to put them in the bank, even though it's free and safer


that still leaves me the question of where to store my old balls for short term, easy access, but very secure storage. and also negates your previous sentence of more places accepting the new fancy ones
@_date: 2018-05-27 03:31:39
it's not really bribing...
i mean in the mechanic world, any type of mechanics... work gets done in order of importance.
even if you bring your car in first, if another person needs their's out sooner, then it's expedited, if they're a more important customer, a more frequent customer, etc...  some pay more for this, some companies have legit fees for this.
it's akin to package delivery...
i ordered mine first, but you paid for overnight. you get it first.... is that unfair?.... no... then why is it unfair in this case?
@_date: 2018-05-07 20:28:07
i meant in regards to "skimming" your bitcoin/stealing bitcoin in someway
Ie... somehow redirecting bitcoin to not your wallet.
@_date: 2018-05-10 01:20:19


don't have bare bones money in your account.
you don't get overdrafted from bank fees. you get overdrafted when you buy shit and you don't have the funds in your acccount to cover it.
I have overdrafted once... and I got no fee assessed, because my bank is good, and they give you 1 overdraft protection a year... at no cost to you
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:11:10
apparently it is...
like the 5 guys secret menu
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:20:38


don't buy shit you can't afford and pay your bills on time.........?
@_date: 2019-03-13 18:01:05


that's electricity bud. I think it is too, although a lot of downsides(like catastrophic melt downs)
But batteries is a growing field, and will power most of the world when it comes to what can't be "plugged in"(to nuclear power) ie... cars, busses, etc
@_date: 2019-03-13 04:21:05
it's a long term thing dude. Just looking at my house, My forecasted electric bill would be 90$. I can produce 92$(estimated) worth of electricty with panels if i get them.....
I am making money on that. There are some people who make well over the cost of their normal bill
@_date: 2019-03-13 04:33:03
I've read all about it. There are certainly trade offs.
But batteries, and electricty is the future of the world. plain and simple
@_date: 2019-03-13 04:19:15


it's actually less toxic waste than previously produced by his operation
Literally less than before, his title clearly states that.
What kind of special are you?

What is bitcoin doing to scale/get faster/get cheaper/keep up with more users using it daily?
@_date: 2019-03-20 22:21:03
i should do this... just start leavin QR codes for my bitcoin addresses around
@_date: 2019-04-23 05:19:24
Anyone feeling this way lately... if so it will get worse ;)
@_date: 2019-04-05 03:22:10
FUN FACT...
When Bitcoin reached it's ATH at around 20k $. Less than .5% of the global population owned ANY cyrpto(Bitcoin)
(based on "x" amount of wallets at the time divided by 4.... ie... average person probably has about 4 wallets.)
Imagine what that price will be when 1% own some, or 10%
@_date: 2019-04-23 01:55:47
FUN FACT...
There isn't enough gold in Fort Knox to account for all the U.S dollars in circulation...
in fact, you would need about 816 Fort Knox's to have enough gold to account for every US Dollar.
Of course, that makes sense right... Because we all know "the dollar" isn't backed by gold anymore....
It's **"backed by full faith and credit of the United States of America"**
And the US just so happens to be about *22 TRILLION DOLLARS* in debt!
My point? Gold and the US dollar is about as valuable as Bitcoin... in that it's value only comes from the value that people give it. We value the dollar which is an infinite source, backed by the highest debt in human history, and a precious metal that until recently had no practice use, AND until recently couldn't be created but now actually can.
Fun facts.

BTC vs BCH vs BCH SV
which one and why?
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:49:55
so is it gonna die for good? or what? why so low? 
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:34:30
1 mill is possible.
look at it this way, bitcoin made it to 20k and less than 1% of the world owned any(that's being generous at 1%)
Imagine if 10% used and owned it!
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:11:10
[too soon? so sad, will this ship right?](

shit you smart main'
@_date: 2018-11-27 04:36:05
luckily i have investments in 2 of those...
what about the claims of the SV guys of bigger block sizes 64mb... eventually 128mb...?
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:39:11


completely agree. but it is very possible
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:04:10
pretty big difference IMO... 1 person might only be 3 years apart and attracted to girls who more or less may look more woman than some women do.
also, it's not like comparing that. It's literally not a ponzi shceme, or any type of scheme. Even if it has no USD value, it can still function and work, that's the whole reason for it was made.... thus if it works exactly as intended than it's not a scheme
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:05:44
by definition(and actual structure) Bitcoin is NOT a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:45:09
why such sad times?
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:12:03
and that one too...
but don't worry. most my buys are near ATH's :/
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:50:41


they could...
or it could go down another 3k in 3-4 days
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:29:12
i said back in when it was still at around 10k, that it would never reach 1k, and if it did it would cause a buying frenzy.
i'm confident that it won't go below 2k/ will shoot up crazy if it gets close to it
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:20:00
getting ready to make a buy... been well over a year.
should i hold off a bit more or buy now?
@_date: 2019-01-25 02:39:12
 DO YOU DAY TRADE OR LONG TERM HODL?
@_date: 2018-11-27 04:14:35

what percent of the world's population owns ANY bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-10 04:05:57
if you don't choose both, you're an idiot.
if you had to chose one, chose stocks.
(stock market is 200 years old, it was just at it's ATH. if you hodl you are literally guaranteed to come out on top)
(fyi... i buy crypto)
@_date: 2018-04-13 04:30:25
explosive news for sure
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:52:58
Does this apply to you right now?
@_date: 2019-05-08 22:09:22
how so, what are the consequences of disclosing such info to random strangers online who don't know you?
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:26:19
yeah, use hitbtc..................
@_date: 2019-05-04 05:47:12
look at it this way...
Bitcoin reached an ATH at around 20k $ per bitcoin.
At that time less than half of 1% of the entire world owned any. That .5% is generous, and most likely below .1%
Imagine if 1% owned some, or 10%....
that's why there are such astronomical forecasts
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:30:50


that's the law.
coinbase does business with banks/is a bank(FDIC insured), banks are not allowed to do business with gambling companies... ergo sending your crypto from coinbase to a gambling site violates their policy and puts them in jeopardy
@_date: 2019-05-04 05:43:51
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:50:19
why though?
specifically why
@_date: 2018-12-29 07:01:15
Better than getting .2% interest rate in a savings account.
that being said, discover has 2% for their savings account, get on that shit!(after you buy bitcoin)
@_date: 2018-12-21 00:05:35
ELI5 what USDC is?
Just made some more buys on coinbase after more than a year, saw it on there.
what is it?
