I like gold, but the idea that there is a lot more of it in the universe makes me like bitcoin more and more each passing technological day.

I had this problem when using a wallet that didn't support Segwit. Check the wallet you are trying to send from if it supports segwit. If not, find an intermediary that can do both (Segwit / Non Segwit) to bridge the gap before sending to Coinbase.

$0.4 off a gallon. Holy shite!

I bet Nelson would buy at the top and sell at the bottom.

The way I think of it is, Miners are doing work for a certain price. If the halving was priced in Miners would be making wayyyy more money than they are now. Once the reward halves, those miners will be making half the amount of BTC on new blocks so the price has no choice but to go up to remain profitable for those individuals.

That's amazing. If there was something like this for the US I would use it!
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:25:39
Doesn't change the fact that it's entirely wrong in every category.
The network is constantly getting stronger, volatility is lower now than it has been in recent months, and we're seeing increased usage especially in places like Venezuela.

It's not an opinion, it's quantifiable, there is evidence to support otherwise. Also Bitcoin is everything it's predecessor is answer more...
@_date: 2019-01-28 02:37:26
Right, but the price if a dollar is always a dollar.
@_date: 2019-01-27 03:12:48
How does the price of a dollar change???
@_date: 2019-01-28 02:38:43
True but that's more related to buying power. What you said made be think 1 dollar could be 5 dollars. There is always a 4 dollar difference between 1 and 5 dollars lol.

Send me $50 on the cash app and I'll send you $50 in Bitcoin.

That's the part that blows me away. I love that I can run a full node, with lightning network off a 25 dollar raspberry pi. The possibilities are pretty much limitless. I can't wait to see the next generation of apps that are build on top of blockchain.

Layer 1 Bitcoin is not meant for super fast transactions. Layer 1 is mostly meant for settlement of larger transactions IE, Lightning network. Get ready for huge things.
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:08:00
If anyone says they are forking, holding your own bitcoin entitles you to the fork regardless if you use an exchange or not.

What did you use to build this shop? I'm impressed!
@_date: 2019-05-13 08:05:10
That's pretty much how I explain it because a multisig dual channel transactions dont compute well with most people.
I like to think that, this is how we will earn interest on our bitcoin by "staking" into a lightning channel so that others can transact in a liquid way. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:56:51
Also the low fees are impressive, relative to on chain payments.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:46:01
Amen, not everyone sees the significance of what Lightning Network offers as a scaling solution to Bitcoin.

Hoe who is you playin' wit, back dat .dat up!

I just woke up from a little nap. Was contemplating cutting my losses, then said "Fuggit, I'm gonna sleep on it." Glad I did. =P
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:54:01
Maybe we should let it stay on the path it's going for a little longer first?
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:57:47
This is only a first iteration. Getting a UI working through this shouldn't take too long.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:51:18
Upvote, I want to see a discussion around this.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:55:42
It isn't necessary to transfer it to your wallet, but depending on how paranoid you are usually your wallet is the safest place.
The exchanges are 24/7.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:54:04
There are lightning enabled mobile wallets out there, yes. Check out eclair!
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:31:40
Good point.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:58:06
Was it too late a month ago? There is no way to tell when it is too late. if there was then it would defeat the purpose of investing lol. I honestly feel like BTC is just catching on mainstream. I talked to our director about it today, and he came from a banking background, yet had not even heard of BTC. So in my opinion barring some major catastrophe with the blockchain, or repeated hack attempts against the major exchanges, BTC is still on its way.

Why does the bidwall fail? I see orders go in for almost 5 dollars under the bid, how does that work?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:00:38
I won't lie. I was pretty upset at the amount of panic that ensued today. Wish I would have just looked at the price this morning and went on with my business.
Took a nap at 109, woke up to 200+ again. New high today/tomorrow?! BTC Here to stay? People perpetuate madness?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:37:21
Upvotes for Tenacious D. This shits not happening today that's for sure. Let the dumb asses jump out and lose money, then watch it soar right back up in front of their eyes.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:56:25
You should be able to set the transfer fee in the settings menu. I believe it's also what "helps" your transaction get processed quickly.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:48:32
Congratz! This put a smile on my face and some fire in my heart! Go bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:58:32
How does that stop someone from creating a buy order with a friend at lower price then selling into the market at current price?
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:44:00
The way I'm seeing it. The infinite divisibility is a major factor. At some point people will only be able to buy divisions of bitcoins instead of buying in at full/multiple bitcoins. I like that it keeps rising, it makes people think "Why did I not hear about this earlier?". 
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:43:55
Came here to make sure no one even uses this. Glad we didn't lose something that people cared about...
It's like the future banks are all fighting for business right now... And most of them would be like hiring a jackrabbit to work their IT department.

d00d you made 50 cents watching video sites!?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:49:04
I Think it's hilarious that even the "Spartans" most likely sold their BTC out of panic. I took a nap at 109 thinking "We'll get back from this." and just woke up to 215 again.
To see a fellow D lover as the top post was a nice little sign to top it off =]. Thanks for the post!
