Great article, my favorite part.
"As of May 6, 2016, bitcoin’s average daily liquidity for the trailing three months3 nearly matched the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) and was three times that of the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ), as shown in the graph below.4 These numbers are surprising considering bitcoin stored $7 billion in value at the time, while the GLD stored $34 billion and the VNQ stored $56 billion. In our opinion, equal or superior volume with a fraction of the assets under management underscores that bitcoin is punching significantly above its weight."
But I do question the statement where they say  million people hold some material bitcoin. While it is possible, I think its very speculative as many people have many different addresses, not to mention there are many addresses with fractions of coins just left on them and abandoned. 
@_date: 2016-08-22 14:31:56

My only problem with Storj at the current moment (take in mind its in beta and rewards are being paid out by the organization themselves) is that the rewards aren't enough to justify leaving a small data center running considering depreciation costs, electric costs and other nontangible costs. Hopefully this problem fixes itself when it fully releases and payments adjust for customer demand. The only thing that worries me is Shawn(leader of the program) believes the way to success is corporate deals with companies that already do cloud storage, rather than going after consumers themselves. Im not sure if I see the same way. Regardless a very interesting project and well see how it turns out. I wish them the best!

However what gives much of the value to the lost coins is speculation on them being lost. If it goes unreported people may just assume someone is holding them. This makes it very hard to 1. Actually know how many are lost and 2. Assess the adjusted value for the lost coins. I think as time goes by we will get a better idea of how many are actually lost through blockchain analysis. 12 years down the road when the vast majority of coins have been mined, if coins haven't moved in 18 years there's a pretty good chance they never will. I would like to see a service that compiles all the addresses of coins that haven't moved in say 5 years or more, total them up and adjust accordingly when old coins move and newer coins become 5 years old. It would be interesting to have that data.

Imo if we don't have centralized institutions that are insured regulated, reputable and allow use cases for people who dont actually ever want to hold the currency, we will never get mainstream adoption. We need to cater to two types of users. Ones who have the knowledge and tech savvy to avoid using centralized institutions and can keep their own coins secure and those who have no intention to do any of those things. The etf would be a huge step, allowing people to truly buy and speculate on the underlying currency without having to bother securing it. This may be an unpopular opinion on this subreddit but it just happens to be mine.

The rewards for an average person to run their computers unused storage are even lower than that of data centers (note when I was talking about data centers I really just meant home network datacenters). At the current time I just don't see people other than those who have a sufficient amount of space for some other reason farming until the return becomes higher. I think many who are doing it now are purely speculative on STORJX. It was a while ago but we talked on slack and the way you were presenting it seemed like that was your main plan. Im sorry if I misinterpreted what you were saying. Like I said this is all my opinion. I actually own some Storjx and participated in the original crowdsale. If im wrong im wrong just giving my opinion.

Andreas made this point in a recent talk. Hopefully it will distribute mining farms as well, but the price will have to raise as well for that to happen.

Without some sort of browser accessibility it won't be realistic to assume it might be a real competitor to places like amazon and ebay.

yes but the demand would change depending on how many coins people believe to be lost which is speculation. I would say rises demand have been the main overall price driver up until now and will most likely stay that way in the near future. Also coins that dont exist can be offered to manipulate the price it goes on in many exchanges and even in real world markets like silver and gold.

I love bitcoin and dislike the fed, but having a nation based currency that is slightly inflationary helps growth and helps grow a nation's economy. The point of bitcoin, gold and other assets that fight inflation is that you are given a choice, bitcoin especially where some countries make it illegal to move out of the currency. The problem with a deflationary currency is in order to grow a country's economy you need people to consume and people who are willing to invest in capital and take risks so businesses can hire new workers and build new factories/machines. If you have a deflationary currency, people will just hoard money and banks won't loan anything because its just better for them to hoard it. There are many other reasons why just thought Id give a few. There's a lot of people who say bring back the gold standard and lets make our currency deflationary, but from an economic standpoint it will do more harm than good. The key is having options for smart citizens who want to save their money to consume at a later time.

As far as I know that is what will happen. With the block halving its asymptotic, there will never really be 21 million bitcoin it will just get very close to reaching it. Although im not sure what happens when the halving is 8 decimal places out, but that point is so ridiculously far out, I wouldnt even worry about it. The one thing I wished was part of the bitcoin code was not a halving every 4 years, but a step down every month that equals a halving every 4 years. This way you dont have a shock to miners and the market slowly adjusts.

During the ghash fiasco home miners were still semi relevant because there were companies selling to average consumers. Almost all of those companies are gone now or not selling to consumers, thats what I meant by different. The average home miner at that point was incentivized to stick with ghash because of the regular payouts and more reliable profit.

I never specified an amount that they would have, I think the comment about the 10x market cap of bitcoin comment by me was a little misleading. I was trying to show a scale and how small we are in comparison and how much money these institutions actually have. Most likely big mutual funds wouldnt carry 1% in bitcoin yes I agree but there are many smaller funds that manage hundreds of millions to billions and make riskier bets like hedge funds that could easily double the price if they were invested.

The real benefit as a store of value over gold in my opinion is a known definitive finite supply. (We know roughly how much gold is left but not anywhere close to definitively) Also the rate at which the supply increases is much better than gold because research shows that when gold prices go up, the amount of gold mined increases greatly.

Obviously if anyone changed the 21m cap no one would change over to the new chain. The only way I could see even the slightest possibility of debate coming up is if the cap is raised and the wallets are scaled for example the new cap is 210m coins and every coin you have now makes it that you have 10 coins. Even with this theres almost no chance it will happen since the community is so divided.

@_date: 2015-06-05 11:30:20
Downvote me to oblivion but the I think there is a serious possibility of a bait and switch for many of these Wall Street companies talking about a distributed ledger. IMO there is a possibility of them ditching bitcoin and making  a distributed ledger that will charge a use fee and secure their own blockchain themselves. Or just have people secure it for them and instead of paying out in tokens just pay them in USD. Nobody believes this could happen because of the longevity and distributed nature of bitcoin, but from the bank's perspective too much is at risk and out of their control. If you get all the big banks together and have them agree on an alternative, its going to become a standard. Im not saying this will happen but the total disconnect of the decentralized ledger from bitcoin is scary and not by coincidence. Whatever game they are playing I want to know. For everyone saying they dont want to taint the idea of blockchain with bitcoin since it has a bad rep needs to realize the only way we get past that is for reputable people to endorse bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-12-29 18:35:31
Yes but its hard to do it in large amounts without raising the price and institutional investors dont want the need of security that comes along with holding their own coins. Go in and pitch most fund managers the idea of buying the currency, but they will have to keep it securely. Oh and if it is stolen from them they wont have any restitution, it will instantly turn them off. Most hold paper products in nice packages and nothing physical (not that you can really call bitcoin physical)
@_date: 2015-06-19 11:22:07

Bakkt brings very little new features to the table.

The take away quote scares me the most because what might happen is a catch 22 type problem with the currency.

How so? I have moved a large portion of my portfolio into real estate for the cashflow and its worked for me. The biggest problem is the barrier to entry but with interest rates still very low compared to historical rates, there are a lot of benefits to mortgaging properties.

Wallstreet etf could do it, also could just be a steady rise from good news/more and more atms getting added so regular people will buy like half of one or little bits. Heres a cool site that counts the amount of bitcoin atms out there ( its nice to go there every couple of days and see the number rise. Also notice how south america/africa are blank. These are two markets bitcoin has still yet to infiltrate fully but could be massively beneficial. Only time will tell.

You're an idiot, i'm not a "butter", i'm realistic. Go through my history I have not once bashed bitcoin, only criticized a few parts of it, one of which is the rapid pump community on r/bitcoin saying things like "$10,000 a bitcoin in inevitable". People like that genuinely hurt this community and are the equivalent of the people calling for bitcoin to fall to a dollar. Nothing is set in stone, and no one knows what the price will be. On reddit you can spout out these baseless analyses without any fear of consequence, so when I see people putting their money where their mouth is, I respect them. Regardless if they "threw  away" their money, they truly believed it was going that high and made a choice instead of sitting idly by and yelling for the price to hit the heavens.

Realistically poor African villagers don't really save much money and if they do, eventually someone will come up with a service that will offer a safe storage solution with the ability to withdraw into a phone wallet.(Does coinapult allow the storage of funds?) It sucks having a company holding the private keys, but I think for poor African villagers it might be one of the better solutions. It makes it so damage/stolen phones don't mean a total loss of savings and people essentially can't be blackmailed/threatened/robbed of their coins. In some places that have very little home security they might be better off taking the security risk of a company holding their keys. I know this is an unpopular opinion and I wouldn't recommend it for people who have other options.

If you have a large amount of coins, you can put three of them in different places so you arent fully vulnerable if you were robbed. For example, maybe 3 different lock boxes at three different banks, or just 2 and one for everyday use.

Actually bitcoin is better in ways because unlike gold, which when it becomes more profitable to do so, more is excavated and mined, bitcoin can only be mined at a fixed rate.

We have been calling it for months that gox was going to fail and warning people to get out. I feel sympathetic for you and people who lost money, but that is what happens in an experimental technology. Cold storage and paper wallets are the only "safe" place for your coins.

The supply of gold is actually not deflationary, all the data shows that as gold becomes more expensive much more of it is mined yearly and inflates the supply. Maybe 1000 years down the line when all the gold is mined, but for now the idea that gold supply is deflationary is wrong. Bitcoin is better than gold in this way.

I sometimes have that " if i just keep buying and waiting I'll be reasonably wealthy" feeling, but ground myself when i start to think that way. I do this primarily because in our age we see so many new things that life cycles hardly ever last 15 yr + and relying on bitcoin starts to make you lazy in other aspects of life. You see it al the time in the work ethic of Silicon Valley startup workers. Many of them just assume that at one point they will be multimillionaires so they blow money dont save and end up at 40 and in a rut. I am still in love with bitcoin, but it is a hobby for me and i need to move my life at the same time regardless. Just a rambling but i see many here who are the complete opposite of buttcoiners and are willing to die by bitcoin and will take no criticism.

Those who arent afraid are not the investors here, if you want to treat bitcoin as an investment then you should be afraid, you are potentially talking about a massive amount of coins that could potentially be dropped on the market, but if you believe in the idea around bitcoin and are planning on keeping it for a long period of time then you shouldn't be as worried. Even if satoshi tanked the market, it would eventually recover. There is also the idea that every day that passes the chance rises that he no longer has access to those coins. I don't know if I believe that idea because all evidence from satoshi has shown that he did everything purposely, dotted his i's and crossed his t's, so either 1. he doesnt want to spend them because it will make him a target or 2. he purposely got rid of the private keys to detach himself from profits of bitcoin. Take your pick of scenarios.

Security for the average joe is the biggest problem with bitcoin as an asset class IMO, not the volatility. I think once we have avenues for people to invest through a third party that can worry about the security,  like an etf , bitcoin will become an established asset. Although everything inside me tells me to not trust other people with my private keys, i know some people might be better off with someone doing so.

Im not a huge fan of Mike Hearn, but just because he has different opinions doesn't make him a crony. The future reality of it is influential people in the industry will make two types of businesses. The first is one seeking regulation or to abide by the rules and the second is the opposite. The market of users will be the deciding factor on which way bitcoin moves.

In a perfect world I don't see a problem with economic planning with government backed currencies, while I would agree with you in our situation it might not be effective to do so. I am not offering a solution to the problem, merely an opinion on the current state of affairs. I think realistically we are stuck with government backed currencies in everyday life for sometime, but we are on the forefront of change. I don't believe we are on the edge of hyperinflation, however I do believe that mistakes of the corporations and banks are being burdened on the American people who used sensibility and austerity to save throughout their lives. Hopefully bitcoin is the start of a long trend of electronic assets that can counter the poor track record of the fed and cater to a free market by the people and for the people. I would argue in our day in age the greatest contribution to ones independence is financial control and I hope the visions laid by this generation in the last few years will eventually come to fruition.

I like this idea but IMO there needs to be a few things that could make it easier. Take in mind many of these things counter what many bitcoiners like, but creates an easy user experience for the majority.  1. No more comments that say tips happened, they just do. Second, every reddit account is tied to one public key so the average user can figure it out by ways of being able to look it up. You can opt to control the private key if you want, otherwise the tip bot would keep it and it would just have you setup a pin to claim your funds.( ok because were not talking about large amounts of money). If users wish to check their funds they simply lookup their username and withdraw it with a PIN number they originally setup. The biggest flaw is trusting the bit with the keys but since were talking a penny an upvote, funds wont be so substantial. This is just my opinion and i know the security flaws are massive but the simplicity is what matters with things like this. Please ignore typos I typed this between classes on my iPhone. Also feel free to rip me a new one or suggest anything in the comments :)

"Margin and leverage trading in Bitcoin is unwise"
Margin and leverage trading is a natural progression for bitcoin, and it lets companies who want to deal in it hedge against unforeseen circumstances. The problem with leverage trading now is that there aren't massive buy and sell walls on each side. On the stock market leverage trading is plausible because you have millions of dollars on each side which hardly ever fall through.

Inflation and printing money isn't the problem, in fact many healthy economies do it. The problem is inflating the currency too much and lying about doing so. The government uses the Consumer Price Index to measure inflation which is bullshit because it measures consumer actions rather than directly calculating the amount they are allowing to enter the economy. When Bernanke says he isn't "printing money" he is talking about not increasing the paper money supply in circulation, but turns a blind eye to the fact that the fed is letting banks borrow massive sums electronically with ridiculously low interest rates. Here's an interesting article on how the inflation stats are misrepresented.

"is not based in the US. Not interested in sending money and my personal information to a foreign company run by a bunch of morons who vouched for mtgox." Kraken was just an alternative for people who arent from the US. Also find one major company in the bitcoin space that didnt vouch for Mtgox at one point.
Coinbase isnt for day trading, it is for getting your coins safely and you pay for safety at this point in the game. 
If you havent realized most of the companies that are in the bitcoin space are run by people that are all friends with eachother, it is just how it works with something that had a tiny user base that expanded greatly.

TMZ tracking bank accounts? Im pretty sure that is very illegal (not saying TMZ doesn't cross the line) but if you purchased bitcoins with a service like coinbase you should be fine. After that as long as your public address isn't tied to you then no one will know.

A side effect of a deflationary currency. Many will say this a dangerous feature, but honestly IMO I see bitcoin as a great store value in terms of inflation protection against fiat.

How can you say its not different? your talking about the difference between millions of dollars vs billions of dollars. Percentage wise it might be the same , but you cant look at it in percentages. As it stands we are at around 16B if each coin was worth 10k our market cap would be 160B lets be generous and say half that needs to enter the market to push the price that high up (because many coins are off the market and not going to be sold). That is still 64 billion dollars that has to enter the market. Its not impossible, but that much money entering the market means that we will have to go much more mainstream than we are now.

Except I would argue they arent in a brutal competitive market. I would say they are probably more of an oligopoly.China running the majority of the hashpower is unique because of the cheap/government sponsored electricity. Almost every country in the world can not compete and the people who have connections to even getting the cheap electricity have some sort of government connections. Not to mention the chip manufacturers are in China and they have some sort of relationship with them. To some extent they are friends with each other and are incentivized by the current high transaction costs to not signal for segwit.

Coinbase is taking the necessary steps to avoid getting shut down because of non compliance with US regulations. Personally I can't really say I blame them, rather I think their actions are just collateral damage of a messed up regulatory system. There really aren't big regulations yet, but they have to be careful if they want to survive. This is why without relaxed regulation in the US, bitcoin entrepreneurship is going to get decimated. If you are uncomfortable with coinbase and the government knowing exactly what you are purchasing and spending, don't use coinbase period. Beware US based companies for the time being.

Technically there is risk to holding the USD, but not a very high risk. I know many here think the US is going to crash and burn, but I dont see that happening any time soon. Comparing the riskiness of holding the USD versus bitcoin is comparing apples to oranges. Holding stock indexes are your best and safest bet for storing wealth in the long term. I like bitcoin, I have a good amount, but to blatantly say that there is no way it is going to fail is just untrue. It still has the possibility of just staying where it is and becoming a niche that never breaks out.

Lending bitcoin is a terrible idea. If the price goes up, people default, if it goes down, you lose money. Same reason why many underdeveloped countries don't have long term loans denominated in their own currency or at all. 
It also turns out that P2P lending in general is a pretty bad idea as many of the people searching out for loans on the internet arent very reliable. Even extremely high rated individuals default sometimes. Lending club found this out the hard way, which is why they have gotten to a point where they offer you free money to lend there.
Its a good idea in theory, but in practice there are too many bad actors and undesirable variables.

sadly I dont have enough to lobby for very long, but the Winklevoss twins did basically lobby when they were trying to get the ETF originally on the NYSE.

With any stock etf though, you are still purchasing holdings in companies. Specifically an answer to your question, China has a few very risky ETFs, but like I said the government recognizes the equity. The government still has no idea what bitcoin is, many different organizations have different opinion.

If you want to be more conservative, put your money in the S&amp;P. On average you are looking at doubling your money (including reinvesting dividends) every 7-8 years or so. He would still have a very hefty amount of money to aid him. It might not be tens of millions, but it will still be very nice and much less risk than bitcoin. Up to you though. Maybe a 50/50 split would work. It depends on your risk profile.

Weekly or daily withdrawal limits, which go up with the amount of information you have provided them. I agree it might be inconvenient if you want to do it under the radar, but it can be done.

Most serious traders right now don't expect the ETF to go through anyway at this point in time.

They should be hedging the price of bitcoin when selling drugs in order to make back a predictable amount. Also if they are holding business funds in bitcoin then they are going about it the wrong way. Drug dealers need to treat selling drugs like any other business and keep funds in fiat after a purchase because at the moment bitcoin is a great transactionary method but a bad store of value method.(Note it would still be a bad store of value method if it went up 100$ because the key is less volatility.

Bitpay is not the only solution to hedging, it just packages it nicely. Farmers have used forms of hedging for centuries to make sure they were paid for their crop and drug dealing can be thought of as the same. "or does bitcoin really offer any unique benefits into the practice." This statement is completely false, using bitcoin allows them to use bitcoin only services anonymously(bitcoin is as anonymous as you make it) that can vastly increase their customer base, while never having to make in person transactions which are dangerous and risky.

maybe, I think its hard to tell so either of us could be right. Were not really sure how many will sell. My reasoning is that many people who hold a 1 or only a few full bitcoin might not sell at 1,000 because that kind of money isnt necessarily very impactful, but at 10k a coin they could pay off their college,debt,ect. But it will take time to tell, either of us could be right. I think eventually we will get that high, im just not so sure in such a short period of time.

Price of Ether hit 1 billion in market cap (the guy in grey) and many people say that the block size debate of big blocks (guy holding the bigger box) and small blocks also known as core and the current blockchain (the small box guy with all the money) is causing people who are upset with the fighting to move their bitcoin money into ether.
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:48:33
Sure, there are services in the works that will be built upon bitcoin which basically use an in house block chain so hypothetically a few bitcoin could be moved around so quickly that more will never be needed from a transactionary standpoint ,unless there are very large transactions (which would most likely show people are using it for some sort of store of value). So hypothetically once these services are built our current market cap or an even lower one could be used to run the whole system. Because the money is moved so frequently and such a few amount would be needed to facilitate the entire system velocity raises substantially.
@_date: 2016-03-01 12:46:54
My problem with core is they complain about centralization with block limit raising, but on the other hand they want bitcoin to be strictly a settlement layer which will rely on companies and the LN to do transactions for everyday people transferring money.

I think it may be sarcasm like well hand over all the wealth to wallstreet, but he could genuinely not know. As for not needing the etf, i wholeheartedly disagree.

In an economic  terminology it's called transaction costs and there are very very many to holding bitcoin by yourself especially if you are not tech savvy.

So this is essentially a bet against Bitcoin the currency. Why? Say you put a Bitcoin in worth 100 and you buy 100 worth of stock. Bitcoin goes up to 200. But you still have only 100 worth of stock so half the btc you put in. It's for people who want to either hedge against Bitcoin or people who can't currently enter the market but can use Bitcoin as a currency exchange system. However I thought the article said you need a million minimum so I'm not sure how big their target demographic  is going to be , because in most of the countries that don't have access to the stock market, it is going to be hard to acquire a million in Bitcoin via an exchange.

A few of my friends work on wallstreet, one who works specifically in compliance and I have talked with her multiple times about the ETF. Its not just bitcoin that is a risk, anything that is new in the SEC's mind is a risk. The SEC is specifically rewarded for not taking risks.
@_date: 2017-02-06 07:19:00
You could have written in comments when there was a commenting period, but that has ended, not much you can do now. In reality, regular people have no say in getting the ETF approved. Even if we had an overwhelming majority and no negative comments (there were a few), the SEC won't approve anything that they think has above average risk, or the ability to make them look bad. Barry Silbert's application to be listed on the NYSE just opened up a commenting period so if you wanted to, you could submit a comment [here]( Just take in mind there is most likely far less weight on comments or what the general public thinks and more weight on suggestions from other regulators, banks, ect.
@_date: 2017-02-11 15:46:40

Your information was taken somehow. Next time I would advise using a hardware wallet if you dont have much technical knowledge. There is still a small chance it can get stolen, but much much smaller than the possibility of leaving it on a wallet with access to the internet on a daily basis. The idea is to get the coins onto something that isnt always online. if you are interested in purchasing a hardware wallet, personally I like the trezor, but it is currently sold out, so the next best for me is the ledger nano. It may be around 75$ but if you are looking to purchase a large amount, it is worth every penny.

We have talked about this multiple times over at bitcoinmarkets. Every person has their own opinion on how factored in it is. In my opinion it is partially factored in, but I think as we get closer the hype might make it raise the price a bit more and also might bring some of the market cap that fled to Eth to come back short term. (Just a guess) There is also an argument that people like me are continuously pumping money in each paycheck regardless of price to stack up before the halving so that might add a small boost. Its anyone's guess though only time will tell.

It was not invented but it was definitely a major possible feature early on, that is still possible through off chains and side chains.

Everybody is waiting for the world to end. Im weary on saying we are going towards a full blown financial crisis. I think well have a pull back but I doubt were going to see a breakdown of all financial institutions. China has been in a bubble for years now, ending QE isnt a problem as long as banks continue to lend and people are willing to take loans. Our stock market will most likely correct big time, but its not going to crash to 2008 and great depressions levels. Idk im not going to point out all your points but I think it is more likely we see a financial recession rather than a depression in the short term.

I want to know if they are going to release a statement on whether or not they are going to put it through again, or just wait for markets to mature. 
Personally if I had their money and I wanted it to work, I would be going to minor exchanges in other countries with much smaller amounts first as a test base and then apply once established. However im sure that would cost a fortune in lawyer fees and be a nightmare getting through regulatory difficulties for something they wouldnt really make a profit on.

So I talked to Shawn Wilkenson on IRC and Slack the past in the past few weeks and we talked about farming (their name for mining) the currency. Basically what he said was buying new hardware and running it probably wont give you an return on investment. He believes that it is really for people who already have the space and arent using it for anything. Also they dont plan to sell directly to the consumer but rather to companies which they will take a cut and you will get a much smaller amount. The majority of STORJX (The currency) is also in the hands of the developers and I really don't see the economics of the price rising. The only way your friend would make an ROI is if the price of the currency skyrockets which would make sense to just buy the currency. I have been in the crowdsale and doing the test groups and you get MUCH less than you think you will. For example I had 5 TB running for a month and only received around $13. Thats running my pc almost 24/7 for a month. You wont get ROI.

@_date: 2016-06-04 16:54:52
Im going to half disagree with you there. I think we may see some movement from the gold market to the bitcoin market just based on the fact that bitcoin is a store of value with a set amount unlike gold which, when the price moves up the amount mined moves up as well . This happens primarily because of more or temporarily shut down gold mining firms entering/reentering the industry. Gold traded on the stock market is also a very tiny fraction of the amount of gold traded wide. I think if we were to get something like an etf, most of the investors would be people looking for returns, so moving over from stocks. I don't think people who are seeking fixed stable returns are going to move away from that market. Im sure some will just like anything else but I wouldn't state that massive amounts would come from that market. Just my opinion though. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 21:36:59
I thought this was a sarcasm post. The danger isnt losing current users, the danger is losing future applications that will be built elsewhere because the bitcoin blockchain can't handle them. I get LN is coming and so is segwit, but they are not here now, and companies   arent going to build something and hope the network can handle it in the future. They are going to look elsewhere to platforms like ethereum or private blockchains, which aren't as safe but still have benefits over what they are using now.

Im talking about a major bank, which would take the loss from hack in order to get their customer funds back, just like what happens if they were robbed in a bank robbery.They are insured by private entities beyond the FDIC . In all likeliness they will hold X amount of bitcoin in a cold wallet and never move it around, just play with numbers in their system. I really dont see them taking bitcoin at all (unless they possibly might exchange it for USD directly), anywhere in the near future. In the eyes of governments, I don't think bitcoin will be viewed as anything but an asset or commodity for a long time to come.
@_date: 2017-01-21 17:50:44

Im usually against regulation, but I think there should be at least one or two regulated exchanges for every country.

Not to mention they can follow the path that they consider to be the real bitcoin and the user hardly wont really ever see the fork money directly. An example is GBTC holders never and wont ever get a benefit from bitcoin cash, only Silbert will and even if the fund increases assets, what you are entitled to doesnt change. So Silbert runs the fund and also refuses to back down on segwit2x. What if he decides to sell all of his core coins and buy segwit 2x. People holding the fund who have no interest in segwit2x are going to get fucked. Not that I think he will do that, but it is a possibility.
GBTC is a scam in my opinion. With high management fees the amount you actually own is slowly getting eaten away and having it tax free in an IRA isnt a big enough of a selling point when you ultimately are losing that tax benefit over time.

Im pretty sure its actually illegal to pay the ransom in the United States.
edit: Also I don't get why HBO would even pay, its not like their revenue model relies on advertising during the episodes, I would guess the amount of views they get is used mostly as a bargaining chip in the deals they make.  They could make the argument that having the episodes released is going to going to stop people from subscribing to their online services, but in reality this far into the season, the vast majority of people who want to watch the show live are already subscribed and those who are going to torrent it, will torrent it. Unless they have something publically damning, it just doesnt make sense to pay.

Yes they are held more accountable in the way that when they register they have to list peoples names, identities, ect. who run the exchange. Try disappearing one day or try saying "we were hacked sorry". They are going to end up in court because you actually have someone to sue. The people who are running the exchange have an incentive to not exit scam or run with the money. I would say that is being held much more accountable.

She doesn't know what it is, how to buy it or secure it. There are no do overs in Bitcoin, someone gets your password and steals your coins, that's it. No way to get them back. I'd tell her either learn about it herself by looking up videos and checking out the side bar , or wait until we have an institutional product like an etf. Bitcoin is not a friendly space for the non tech savvy.

Well Vanguard offers like 1000 different products, but I assume hes probably going to go into something like VTI ( Vanguard Total Market ETF) which on average returns 10% a year and doubles your money  over a long period of time with very little risk. If you are young and saving for retirement in 30 years or so it is a pretty good investment. He could put like 300k in there and not have to worry about contributing anything to his retirement. Bitcoin might outperform VTI (I personally think it will as well) but you have to measure your risk tolerance and everyone has an opportunity cost for which they are willing to cash out some.

Guys don't shoot your loads too quickly we won't likely get news until January and more likely than not they are going to delay again until they absolutely have to make a decision. The winklevoss twins are just showing the sec they are prepared should a positive outlook come. I said it before in another thread but the sec isn't going to approve anything that there's even a small chance of having them look like idiots on so I wouldn't consider this a sure thing especially without insurance. The solids etf at this point seems more likely because of their accountability for funds if something happens, even if it's ultimately an empty promise.

I think outside factors at play will stop this from happening, UNLESS the price continues to rise and make it more profitable, then all bets are off.

The problem is miners have a bargaining chip by blocking segwit now to get a fork done before or at the same time and they aren't going to give that opportunity up. They have zero faith that core will honor a hard fork after if they allow segwit to go through. I don't think we will see any type of compromise until something happens.
@_date: 2017-01-20 15:16:37
This is not an ETF right ? I believe this is just them trying to list their fund so you don't have to be an accredited investor. Am I wrong? Their fund doesn't interest me, there are very high fees in the long term, which an ETF would most likely not have. There is potential that if another ETF is released though, they will lower fees to compete.

Also I NEVER said bitcoin wouldnt go above 10k I only said I doubted it would happen in 2017. I have been in this space since 2012 and I am more optimistic than I was back then. The problem is setting realistic expectations when everyone on this sub is calling for a 100k bitcoin in a year. Take in mind many of these were the same people who either left the space or sold during the two year bear market while many of us accumulated. 
Im just putting out what the facts are for this moment in time and they are that an ETF isnt going to be approved. Weve been "on the cusp" of an ETF for years now but in reality the SEC doesnt want one and they will be the end all be all decider for the immediate future. Liek I said, maybe in a few years, but I dont see this one happening.

People early on who have a large amount of coins cashing out is not only highly likely , but very expected. I posted in another thread but people with larger amounts of money tend to move towards lower risk portfolios. If you had millions worth of coins and could live comfortably now and in the future of what happens in bitcoin, wouldn't you sell some as well? It is just a natural thing that happens in markets where the value of something raises so quickly. The difference between now and 2013 is that we can eat up the supply much easier than we could back then.

The SEC doesnt care, they see where the majority of the trade volume is happening and it isnt on regulated exchanges. They are also very hesitant about giving an ETF to an asset class that is easy to obfuscate ownership and hide (Jay Clayton called it asset verification). Many people are getting rich and very few are reporting gains for tax purposes.
They might just be using it as an excuse to not approve an ETF who knows, but I do know that is their stance on the matter, at the present moment. They dont want an approval and they wont be approving one in the short term.I think it will take time and more built up pressure from institutions in my opinion. Give it a couple of years and I think well have one.

There was discussion about this on bitcoinmarkets and the filing is pretty much bullshit and not going to get passed.

Im not wrong, BS In Econ from a top tier university which requires many intensive labor markets classes so let me address your comments one by one.
"Cheap prices have done shit for middle class and working class Americans." Wrong, over the last 100 years Americans on average have been increasing quality of life regardless of income bracket. 
"And you still will be pissed that your kids get beat up at school by Latino gangs and that none of the schools are worth shit anymore because half the kids can't fucking speak English." Your lack of proper education in a field with demand has brought your child to a bad neighborhood and school. 
"Oh yeah, your taxes have gone up too, because the wonderful immigrants all have decided it makes more sense for them to stop by the emergency room for free when they need to."
Taxes have actually gone down in the last 100 years for almost all income brackets. 
"Bottom line: cheap goods don't compensate for loss of jobs and industry." That isnt a problem with the industry. 
This is a job with the individual who needs to return to school and reeducate themselves for the changing market. Things are not black and white and many of what i said seems extremely harsh but the work force is a cold brutal place. You know what happens when you force companies to hire Americans and remove cheap labor? They leave and head to other places.
Like I said before, our biggest threat to this country is the wage gap NOT the immigration problem. People want someone to throw under the bus and they chose the weakest targets. 
Look at that chart, the US is making more than ever before and its not going to you and me.

LOL I was sleeping but I am now awake to a million notifications. Just an update for everyone since there is a real possibility that 10k will happen in 2017. 
. No i havent forgotten, I get messages everyday at this point
. No I havent sold any of my coins, in fact I have more than when I made that statement. 
. I always thought bitcoin would hit 10k but I didnt think it would happen in 2017, which is why I made the comment. Personally I thought it would be more like 2019-2020 during the next halving, but things happened much quicker than I thought.
. John McAfee has nothing on me
At this point im mostly just trying to run out the clock. Since there is a possibility of it happening, I should probably set specifics. The price has to cross 10k USD on the bitcoinity average (so we get a nice gif) it cant be a flash spike like what happened to gemini a few months ago, it has to be what most people would consider real . If it happens I will do something, I promise.

We're not talking about the unseen economic value of something here, we're strictly talking about the increase in price. As an investor I don't care if Exxon destroys the planet if their share price doubles. As a concerned human being on the planet I do, but the two are separated.

If I had to guess Roger got the straight story which was " as long as there isnt a bank run, we can continue to earn back the stolen/lost bitcoin" and Ver tried to stop the possibility of a bankrun, but ultimately the boost in price caused people to pull off coins and they had to issue withdrawal delays, which was the beginning of the end.

Ill make you a 1 btc bet it isnt at that level in March or hell even at this time next year. Things take time, been watching traders on bitcoinmarkets talk about it for years. Not addressing obvious facts. Trends are nice to look at, but you need to look past them because most charting models are made for stocks and places that money can get to easily. Bitcoin still has a large barrier to entry with purchasing it in very large amounts and securing it safely by yourself. The amount we need to hit 10k per, we would need to have better connections to institutional investors via an etf or another financial product. It could happen eventually, in fact if it did, I would be a very wealthy man, but I just dont see it happening in such a short period of time.

I guess today I want to get downvoted to oblivion, so here I go. Social responsibility is a joke when it comes to investing, its like ethics in Law. Very few people actually give a shit in practice. Companies like Phillip Morris who kill people and the environment soar in price because people only care about making money. 
The rational investor should only care about making the best return just like rational businesses should only focus on what makes them the most profitable. If I am a business that has radioactive sewage that could kill a handful of people if I dump it, but it would cost $5 more for me to dispose it properly, im going to dump it and kill those people. You are more than welcome to invest in lower return products that dont kill the environment and dont act rationally, but you are inefficient.

"Or could it be that bitcoins will actually not be valuable in the future...." It is very possible that this could happen which is why the price isnt higher. If there was a 100% chance bitcoin would become a store of value for billions and go internationally mainstream it would be at a much higher price, but the fact is the future is unknown. Hypothetically bitcoin could be replaced by something else, it could not become a store of value and just a transitory currency with price fluctuations. Still the beginning anything could happen.

You can severely hurt the price though. Make it illegal to transact in or hold. Go after the choke points like exchanges. Basically make it very hard to use, transact, purchase, ect. Kills speculation because the big wallstreet money wont ever invest.
Everything will basically move to the darknet, which doesnt mean it dies, but it will remain a niche asset. Lets be realistic, if big governments wanted to, they could hurt bitcoin together. It would cost them a lot of money and manpower though.

The biggest problem is Bitcoin has become such a big thing that it takes months to convince people to accept change, unlike altcoins which you can pretty much make changes uncontested, which I have to admit would be easier. Half the community still believes bitcoin is perfect as it is and nothing could improve it. I hope people become more open minded as time goes by, but most likely  it will just become harder to get things done. (Look at Block size debate.)
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:14:25
This makes much more sense, she probably just thought it was bitcoin because linden dollars are also a form of digital currency (albeit not decentralized or cryptographic, more akin to egold). Especially since the gig was in Second Life (linden labs is the game developer) and the amount of coins, given the timing, doesnt make sense. We would know who made the offer if it were that many coins, since there were only a handful of people who had that much and we mostly know who they are.

I love bitcoin, I have about 95% of my net worth in it. That being said, bitcoin is not replacing fiat currencies, it isnt replacing the S&amp;P500, it isnt replacing business that have no need and will never have a need for crypto or blockchains. 
By the way in terms of adoption, we have no idea how to evaluate if crypto is at the bottom of the S curve, because it is really something that we realize in hindsight. There have been many technologies that had tons in investment that ultimately fizzled out. 
 
Lets be realistic and not mislead people here. For most people, 90% into the market and 5/10 % into crypto is the best move. It might not make them as much money as being in as much as I am, but its about managing risk. Im young enough to make it all back and still retire comfortably, that is not the case for my father or mother.

Eric is speaking as a free market economist. Unfortunately I disagree with him on this one. I personally don't want a free market labor force. I would rather work towards finding a minimum wage that maximizes a livable wage with a small amount of unemployment.

Running an economy on a deflationary currency is a very bad idea. At risk of getting downvoted to oblivion and despite what many people in this sub think, the gold standard was a bad idea.

People spend less on many goods because their money will be worth more tomorrow. When you have a capitalist economy this means businesses dont hire more workers because they are selling fewer goods. People also horde the currency itself so you dont have the investment into the government through tbills and businesses through stocks. A small amount of inflation and a reasonable debt to gdp ratio are the way to go.

Selling these coins is actually very good for the long term even if we completely disregard the price. Spreading those coins out is great for wealth distribution so things like this are more unlikely to happen in the future.

Part of the point of bitcoin is no one can force you to do anything with your money you dont want to, so if he wants to sell that is his decision.

yes but the straw that broke the camel's back during the housing bubble collapse, was that homes crashed in value and people became underwater. Also people are far less likely to be buying cars they cant afford as a means of speculative investment. Cars almost always lose value the second they are purchased. Homes were considered investments so people thought they could afford more than they actually could. We wont have this problem as much with auto debt. I personally think that if we have another bubble collapse that kills jobs, the next bubble that is going to pop is student debt, as people wont be able to get jobs and pay back their loans. However loans post 2008 almost always have cosigners so theres that too.

Youre comparing a currency to a company. Roman banks all collapsed when the empire did yet the denarius still has value as a collectors item.

Mining with GPUs was out in 2013. FPGAs and later asics killed gpu mining. However I did run a large scale gpu mine in 2013 mining altcoins and trading them into bitcoin which paid off for me. Sold off my machines before scrypt asics hit the market and put that money into bitcoin as well.

I was doing this along with many other players (granted there probably werent many like me that were transferring most of my earnings into btc) in 2012-2013. I didnt even run it on a large scale. I ran 10-15 accounts and made probably 300ish a week. I saw Chinese farmers with hundreds of accounts. Runescape is tricky though because Jagex (the developers) goes through periods of banning and not banning accounts. One day they might come in an wipe out your entire operation and you have to lay low for a month or so.
Also the key is having good bots that are not public and shared with large communities. Someone who has the ability to create good bots with decent methods of making money can make millions a year botting various games.

If you read the statements about why, they obviously will still affect the Van Eck and SolidX proposals. The SEC has little to gain by allowing, what is still a very risky asset class to trade as an ETF to average Joe investors. 
They just don't want the risk. Even the GLD ETF was heavily fought over and that is an ETF on a commodity thousands of years old. New chairmen will be coming, which could possibly sway the vote, but at this point in time, I dont believe it will happen, maybe in a few years.

He hasnt moved his coins since bitcoin was a month or two old and just did. Theres a site that tracks how many "bitcoin days are destroyed" when he does this. Im not really familiar with the site but its basically saying that many people thought those coins were lose or never going to be accessed again. Hes letting us know it was him just to let people don't have to speculate on who moved coins.

The 2.5x mining cost is a bad metric. Historically it might have gone up, but just like other commodities, mines can easily shut down. Historically I will say we see people mining and gambling on profits, but if it got low enough where they couldnt pay the electric bills, they arent going to mine. We have gotten close to this point before

Tim Draper is the third in line of VCs he was already very wealthy growing up. Im not saying he hasnt done anything, quite the opposite, but he started with a leg up and had the capital to invest at an early age. He also has an agenda as he owns a ton of bitcoin. I highly doubt 250k is coming by 2022, but would love to be proven wrong. It requires too much of the world's capital to move into bitcoin, something that wont happen in a mere 4 years.

Shares can only be sold by people who have been holding shares for 12 months, probably meaning even if shares hit the market there probably wont be a massive amount as they arent that keen on selling right now at the current bids. They could set asks though which might be met but probably more as a novelty of having the first GBTC trade. I woudnt expect anything massive happening right now imo. Also take in mind the second they sell the taxman is going to want his cut. Imo most of Barry's shareholders are going to keep their coins off of brokerages.

Probably didnt give as much exposure as they hoped for, thats why both parties decided to opt out.

DPR's coins were not forfeited, they were seized from the site and the government allowed the owners to come forward and claim them.

Yeah but currently there arent huge sites that cater to crowdfund investing without having to prove you are an accredited investor which is something like 2 mill in assets or 250k earnings a year. Also barriers to entry were like 5-10k now sites like crowdfunder are working on revamping so they can literally be the kickstarter of investing. Now you dont have to just give away money to a kick starter, but actually invest and make a return on your investment. IMO sites like kickstarter and indigogo are going to hurt badly in a year or so when people start realizing they can support a project and get a cut of the profits.

Im part of the silverbugs community as well as bitcoin and Im actually very surprised how many people on that subreddit are fans of bitcoin as well.

In a very basic way a negative interest rate is an attempt to have a tax on cash and force people to spend it rather than horde it, or at least invest it in the asset market. Unfortunately the Japanese market isn't performing well so they are looking for alternatives, which Bitcoin seems to be one. The other alternative is literally people buying safes and hoarding bills at home.

Be held in your hand I guess, but its mined more when the price is higher so its not really released at a stable rate like bitcoin. The struggle isnt necessarily what we need bitcoin to do its how to get people to accept it as an alternative.
@_date: 2015-10-24 16:57:47
Being compliant and censorship resistant are not mutually exclusive. Software can be built on bitcoin to provide what each user wants to make of it. The biggest problem here is lack of incentive for developers. Developers don't earn money like miners for contributing to bitcoin so they are willing to take on projects from third parties who have "skin in the game" If you want to see projects that don't appeal to the "mainstream", it is up to the community to fund them. Almost all entrepreneurs in the bitcoin space are out to make money  and many have no interest in your values, they are interested in selling their companies and retiring at 30.

The list goes on and on. Banks and other corporations dont want to be involved in public ledgers underpinned by bitcoin when they can service their purposes with a private blockchain. It is very clear at this point and no one wants to have a serious discussion about it, but rather they just say "fuck the banks".

Its not just one or the other, bitcoin can be built upon to support both. Many people argue that if you become compliant with governments and build the infrastructure that allows tracking and blockchain analysis, censorship resistance goes out of the window, but that isnt true. Because bitcoin is a protocol people can build the type of utilities they want on top of it. Think of accessing the internet via google chrome vs Tor. As long as the base protocol remains unchanged (most likely it will or else the majority wouldnt go to the changed version.) we are fine.

I have been calling since the beginning that it is a real possibility that private blockchains are all the banks really want and not the bitcoin blockchain. The companies that are adopting the tech don't want open systems and the private blockchains will still work better than what they have. Sure they are not as secure but they don't have the inherent costs the bitcoin blockchain has. Instead of people opening a dialogue on the subject so we can talk about it they just downvote you and regurgitate whatever they hear from people like Andreas and Ver.

Before this approval only accredited investors (wealthy individuals) were allowed to participate in private company investing. Kickstarter and Indigogo get around this by making everything a donation, however in 90ish days when this becomes effective all americans will be able to participate in private company investing so you can get shares prior to an IPO. For example if Oculos Rift did crowdfund investing you would have earned money for your shares when they sold it to facebook rather than getting screwed over.

GBTC is eating away at the coins you actually own through management fees and if there ever was an etf on the horizon all that premium you are paying would be gone. If you plan on holding for multiple years, long term you might actually be better off paying the capital gains tax.

If the price doesn't rise miners will drop out but not 50% of them. Many will also continue to mine at a theoretical loss due to tax breaks. As long as income is greater than variable cost ( electricity, workers, ect) miners will still mine.

How relevant Satoshi's response to Mike is now.Curious what he/she is thinking about the block space debate going on now.
"The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide.  Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It never really hits a scale ceiling.  If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size.
By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10.  Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions. "

3 months is a long time in the bitcoin world. Honestly as much as I want it to be I doubt it will be completely on the bitcoin blockchain.

It depends on the market though if gold goes down consistently and mines halt production indefinitely and then suddenly the price soars, all these firms are near instantly ready to enter back into the market. You really see a big lag when the price stagnates over a long period of time and then goes up and there needs to be new mines created and explored. You see this in oil production as well, especially with the recent crisis going on.

If you learned about it in Corporate Finance, you should have also learned about the Efficient Markets Theory or just what efficient markets are in general. The bond and stock markets my not be perfectly efficient but they are close to it, the bitcoin market on the other hand is nowhere near efficient. Because many of the investors are/were not aware of the halving previously or aren't keeping up to date on news, pricing things in is nearly impossible at this time. Because the market is still in its relative infancy not everyone is fully informed and the market is not efficient.

Bitcoin doesnt want the in person market. I say give that market to creditcard companies and bitcoin takes the online market.

I once saw a movie where Santa Claus could no longer deliver presents because his sleigh ran on Christmas spirit and no one in the world believed in Santa anymore. A kid gets Santa's book and starts reading out what people wanted for Christmas and restores the lost spirit and Santa is able to deliver the presents. What does this have to do with bitcoin you ask? Well bitcoins are basically the presents and the Christmas spirit is the belief in bitcoin around the world. There is no way to value a currency based strictly on the desire to use it internationally. Bitcoin growth or death will always be speculation. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, its just impossible to predict the future of. What I can tell you though is internationally, people fear their governments, and as long as there are governments and organizations to fear people will find a use for bitcoin. Bitcoin is a new age example of the greater fool theory at work.

I use bitcards , which have worked so far ( I say so far because you never know if something is 100% safe)  they might be worth checking out. With that sort of money I would spend however much you had to in order to make sure the coins are safe. You could also wait until some other options like trezor start rolling out. That being said I bitcoins are still an extremely risky investment, so good luck sir.
@_date: 2013-06-08 17:45:41
lol they got the last guys question completely wrong. He was asking if, because bit coins are mined by computers, won't companies who have the most computers own the majority of the bitcoins? The answer is no because the amount of computers on the system far outweighs what these large mining companies would be able to afford/run. Not to mention currently most mining companies sell their majority of bit coins onto exchanges at the end of the month to cover electricity and take immediate payment gains.

it is sending a message to governments that think it is ok to fund wars on our dime. It is sending a  message to bankers who think they can manipulate our economy and make us believe that the only place feasible to store our money is in a bank. Money is oxygen to these organizations, cut off the supply and they die.

Btc isnt stable enough to hold large amounts of personal savings yet. We need to create a much higher demand and increase the market cap to a reasonably high amount 500b-1t before we can make a claim like that. A feat like that takes time and hold which may have a loss this year has withstood the test of time with a mostly positive return and over a period of centuries. Good things take time

How does Bridgewalker work to keep the USD to bitcoin at a consistent price? Does the trade not actually trigger until you spend the money, or do you have a reserve amount to cover the trade?

I got a good laugh, I mean there are other jokes too, just to name a few, memecoin , Hobonickels or what about BBQ coin? I mean do we really need to have a coin dedicated to BBQ?

The corrections might be minor at this level, even not noticeable , but I agree with you if the price rises too quickly we will see a correction. Plain and simple this is because everyone has an opportunity cost at which they would sell their bitcoins. Some people have a smaller price, some have a larger one. If the price moves too quickly more people move to a price where they would sell their bitcoins. This in return lowers the price which could potentially scare off others and a large sell off commences. With no corrections you risk popping another bubble and worst of all risk price stability. The key to bitcoin is stability because it is a currency not a stock.People don't want to pay with a system if it risks losing what they put into it in a short period of time. TLDR-Slow and steady is the way to be.

oh wow I didnt know the cap was that high Thanks for the info!

I always use BTC-e because its usually the lowest due to complications with deposits. However it also feels like the most realistic because its a good place when you need to turn bitcoins into USD fast.
@_date: 2013-10-31 04:44:09
I love bitcoin, but it shouldnt be on primarily because it is far too small to be considered anything but a complete risk. In addition most on are looking for medium risk/conservative investments. The reality will change, but it will take some time.

sadly I have been here mining coins on my computer since they were 30-40 $, but being a poor college student is still a poor college student regardless of the price. :( I have 2 btc so i cant complain, but this was at a time when many others who are millionaires now, bought coins.

How does the card work in general? Say i ordered a card that says 1 bitcoin. It would come with zero and i would just have to send 1btc to the public address on the card? Also how does one go about withdrawing from the card? Thanks in advance, i have just been confused with offline wallets in general.
@_date: 2013-11-01 23:39:33
You guys should make a classic hot sauce for bland people like me :)
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:56:18
Do you guys ever plan to possibly create a card with a bitcoin balance that can be used as a credit card and just exchanged to the desired currency?

There is also a small chance that Paypal is sold on the idea of bitcoins and looking to try and get ebay to accept them in order to add a well known service to a release. The biggest obstacle for a company like paypal accepting bitcoins, is lack of Grade A merchants who take them. Just my two cents

Erik is one of the most well spoken and level headed bitcoin guys around. Erik gets my vote as well. Roger Ver would also be ok. Imo Jon Matonis might not be right, as well as Mike Hearn

@_date: 2013-12-14 08:48:51
Ok I understand where youre coming from. I was thinking more on the lines of using bitcoin to fund an account that would be dipped into every time certain transactions take place. You see this with alot of games and having premium currency. You can buy like 500 special gems or whatever and use them however you see fit.

The real question is who has sizable stakes in bitcoin. To be fair someone like Gates and Schmidt could throw 5 million in bitcoin each and not even notice a loss on a balance sheet.

I wish KnCminer the best of luck and hopefully they deliver. A mining company with good PR, but most importantly trust, could kill in the industry right now.

Yeah, but this is where I am confused because I would think this method would keep transaction fees artificially high. If bitcoin needs "x" amount of hashing power to process transactions and miners require "y" amount of reward to be worth it to mine, wouldn't that mean transactions of lower amounts pay a higher percentage to work?
