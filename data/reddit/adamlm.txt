Thank you for this, now I finally understand the differences between Segwit and BU.

I am really concerned about rules of winning lottery in U.S. I mean you are obliged to pose on photos like this. Potential robbers will know your name and face. Nice. Here in EU if you win you can remain anonymous. Only the chief of local lotto office will know your identity.

Very nice, but kanji is so annoying for those who don't speak Japanese, hope to see English version soon.

I admire your hard work. Please post this address and I'll send you a tip. My bitcoin app can't read QR from saved photos.

Does blockcain.info wallet support segwit transactions? How to generate one? Do I need to have a segwit address there?

The same. I exported private keys from Multibit 0.5.18 and imported them into Electrum which allows you to set the fee manually based on current values.

I suggest you to use the following photo for this thread:

Oh tenebrix...and then fairbrix... and the first altcoins like peercoin, terracoin (that one with deflation) and super-fast bitcoin deployed as "geistgeld". I'm also on bitcointalk since 2011 :) and holding since then.

No, you will be able to recover your coins on both chains using your private keys. The more coins you keep the more you will have on both chains so it's a good idea to hold until August

I think that it doesn't matter what wallet software do you use - the most important thing is to have your BTC on the address which you control (owe the private key) before August 1st. Then all these BTC will be available on both chains after a hard fork.

Paper wallet means you control your private keys  so it's ok

I'd say between $5000 and $10000
@_date: 2017-06-24 07:43:39
After a fork there will be different wallet software for both chains. You will be able to import your keys to both wallets. You will have two separate coins with the same keys, that's all.
