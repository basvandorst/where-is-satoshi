Probably because it's a very nuanced argument on how it's a scam. Bitcoin users obviously know, but I think it's not very obvious to the non crypto world, where both sides have reasonable sounding arguments to non experts.

Play store is the trusted social circle in this context. You can still install apps that aren't from the play store. If they banned it from being installed at the OS level, I'd call that censorship. I'm fine with this form of censorship and think it's reasonable to not list malicious apps in the app store.

I guess I'm still not following. Are you saying rich people or even middle class people would prefer a risk-free 1% vs a risky 10%? Who doesn't have access to the stock market? Poor people with no money? Are you saying poor people living paycheck to paycheck need extra incentive to spend? Who would be hoarding their money in 1% cash vs not spending/investing it?
The 30% of the population carrying a credit card balance would probably benefit from having incentive to save, instead or incentive to spend, imo. The upper class will always prefer 10% investments vs risk free 1%. I just don't know is benefitting here.

I don't really follow this logic. Stock market returns are based on inflation rates as well. If inflation was 1% or -1%, I'm still going to buy what I need and invest the rest at 8% or 10%, depending on what the inflation rate is. That's how rich people do it, which is the bulk of investment money. Rich people don't think, oh I can just get 1% holding it in cash, so no need to invest it at 10%.

That would add up for merchants/companies.

The explanation is rather simple, actually. Dems/Repubs think the solution to basically all problems a private company has is a government solution. If private banking is causing a problem, more regulations. People don't view Bitcoin as an answer to that problem, they just see it as some new fangled thing that will need massive amounts of regulations in order for it to work. They hear a story where someone got hacked, and think this thing is useless until we get more regulations so nobody can get hacked. That's essentially already what traditional banking provides to them.
Also, most people don't have a problem with the banks or fed.

That's what I was referring to with they focus a *little* too much on the short term, but overall these companies still massively care about the long term. Like that's one example. But other examples of them expanding into mobile, expanding into esports, buying out other companies. These are long term growth opportunities they're trying. I'm not super familiar with the company, so I'm sure I'm missing something, but for every shortsighted money gran these companies do, they also have things brewing in the pipeline down the road.

It makes sense. After a certain amount of time, nobody will likely ever collect it. Plus money is fungible, so they can always just pay it back from someone else's money if someone claims it way later than expected.

It varies state to state. Most states set the dormant account times at 3-5 years. Interest accrued and the balance would be given to the missing money department (the states treasury), which you can file a claim and get back. It's a good policy, imo. If you haven't accessed your account over X years, there's a good chance you've forgotten about it, and can now get it back more easily. If you knew about it all along and didn't forget, try to access it at the bank but it's gone, the bank will tell you how to get it back. 2 years does seem too short, but after some amount of time the bank shouldn't get to keep your money. The missing money website makes it easier to track down dead relatives money you don't know about or money you forgotten about, instead of trying to contact any bank, utility company, etc, your parents may or may not have had.
Some company owed me like $100 that I forgot about. Without this law, they would have kept it. But every few years I search the missing money website and I found it, so I now got that money. The policy is intended to help you get money back you legitimately forgot about with the small consequence of money you didn't forget about but didn't access over X amount of time gets sent to the government and makes you have to do extra steps to get it back. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 14:42:02
This policy is intended to help people get missing money back. There's a million organizations that might be "holding" your money, but if you don't know they have it, you will never claim it and the bank or company would just keep your money. With the policy, now there's a centralized organization you can contact to get that money back. I think it's a great policy. There's also situations like dead parents that you wouldn't necessarily know where they kept all their accounts at. Sure, the companies could all just keep the dead person's money and let the onus be on the kids for tracking it all down. But it's easier to just contact one central place to see if your parents had any accounts you didn't know about.

Money is an inefficient tool used to allocate human time. The more automation grows, the less this tool is useful.

Whether or not it's in bitconnect or btc or stocks, you and you wife need to be on the same page if you're investing money. Doing any investing or big spending behind your spouses back when you're saving up for a house and have a kid is a pretty shit thing to do.

They arguably focus too much on short term results, I agree. But most big companies still spend billions on capital expenditures, research and development, etc, that all could have been delayed. That's literally billions of dollars of taking small hits in the short term to put themselves in a better position long term. Even a company like Pepsi which shouldn't need to do much spent like 5+ billion to improve their long term position last year.

I think the idea is we've already gone from 100% cash to 8% cash where the rest are digital ledgers that can be exchanged for cash if need be. But as digital ledgers become more common, there can be offshoot digital ledgers as well. You often see this now where there are basically side economies where you can't convert out the money to cash, but those digital ledgers help guide people's time. Think even something as simple as reddit upvotes. How many upvotes you might get helps determine how likely you are to respond/create something. In a fully automated world where everyones needs are met, I imagine there may be no need for money.
Money has gone down in value since the 1840s. $1 in 1840 is now worth like $29.

The bank didn't steal the money. The bank gave it over to the government to hold in a centralized searchable database for missing money. Had he legitimately forgotten about the account or died, he or his kids will now have a chance to reclaim the money. Without this policy, the bank would just get to keep money in cases of legitimately forgotten money.

Because they're not smart. Businesses routinely take small hits in the short term. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 17:55:33
That's the story being spouted, but how true is it? People love to talk about it, but only with respect to the long-term sacrifices they think companies are making. But even a company like Pepsi which makes consumer staples and shouldn't require too much, spent 5B+ last year for long term prospects, when in theory, if they were focusing on short term stuff, they wouldn't have spent that 5B and given it to shareholders for extra profits today. What's really happening is big companies spend *a little* too much time/money on the next quarter, but most big companies still favor the long term. Can you even name a big company that's not doing R&amp;D or capital expenditures for the long term?

Sort of. Losses can be carried forward over to next year.

It could even be as simple as one outlet like the Associated Press covered it, then everyone else realized it was trending and quick wrote up some mimic article based on the press release.

I think maybe it can be? Like if it decreased by 110%, for every $1 I've held onto, that $1 has turned into a debt obligation of $0.10. I'm not 200% sure about this though.

Also write it off against gains made in other places (like stocks) and carry forward losses to following years to deduct another 3k vs income or vs other capital gains.

I find this article misinformed. Market cap is a perfectly fine way to rank coins. All the same issues exist in the stock market. Companies do air drops, splits, dilute their shares, lost shares, etc all the time. The only difference is that in the stock market, it's incredibly efficient, mature, and liquid. So the effects of companies doing these things gets price adjusted in seconds. The crypto markets are incredibly inefficient. That doesn't mean market cap is a useless measure. 
Think about what's happening. If, for example, tron was going to massively dilute your shares, that would be an excellent time to sell. Anyone buying in or holding at a similar price after a massive dilution is probably making a terrible mistake. However, over time, markets get more efficient and these issues should correct themselves. In the stock market, when companies massively dilute their shares, people short or sell right before the dilution happens and the price gets updated in seconds.
In the case of a split, compare it to a stock split. When PayPal split off from eBay, holders of eBay now had 1 share of eBay and 1 share of PayPal. They added a new company to the s&amp;p500 "out of thin air."  Anyone with half a brain would understand that PayPal market cap plus eBay market cap should roughly equal original eBay market cap. The price reflected that in seconds in the stock market. Now in the crypto world, if bch splits and forms bch and bsv, the market cap of the 2 should roughly equal that of the original chain. Except the market is inefficient. If all the sudden the combined market cap is significantly bigger than that of the original chain, now is your opportunity to profit from this market inefficiency. You should be buying bch before the split, then selling them both after the split. That makes you profit, and makes the market more efficient. That's exactly the kind of thing HFT firms do when they notice systematic errors in people's valuations of stocks. It's not a problem with the market cap measure, it's showing an opportunity to profit from an incredibly inefficient market.

I'd diversify some of it into some index funds. Something like VTSAX is a great fund that invests in every us stock on the market. I'd put at least 25% of your crypto into that.

Pretend you had ~500k cash right now and no investments. What would you do with it?  That should be your answer of how much you hold. My guess is you wouldn't go put 400k+ into btc right now. If you had 500k cash, I think it'd be reasonable to invest 20-100k into btc, depending on risk tolerance. 400k+ would be pretty damn ballsy. The only reason to deviate from this idea is tax costs of switching. It may make sense to hold marginally more than you otherwise would to avoid some taxes.
I agree on 100k to stock market. I'd probably go much higher, but at least 100k is definitely a good idea. Diversity is important. Btc has a non zero percent chance of dropping 90%+. Stock market won't. I'd recommend putting 400k into stocks and think about chucking (ie. holding) 100k into crypto for diversity, not vice versa.

You're confusing holders vs have bought it once in the past. Probably a whole mess of people bought $100 during the latest bull run, then dumped it when they lost half.

I actually think apple was almost never an obvious buy. Tech was moving fast and this year's iPad was next year's piece of garbage. They also had a big problem called competition. I mean Apple's worldwide market share in PCs fell from a peak of 9.6 percent in 1991 to 2 percent in 2004. That's the kind of company that can go under pretty easily. That's also the kind of company I wouldn't trust to succeed with the iPhone, even with first (real) mover advantage. They clearly were doing something wrong in selling and/or making tech. It took me many many years before I finally believed apple had turned a leaf and knew what they were doing. Anyone that held apple since the 90s or whatever must have had balls of steel not to cash out. Thinking apple was obvious is pure hindsight bias.
