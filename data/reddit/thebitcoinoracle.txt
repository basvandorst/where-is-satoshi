^ yes, what if we're the same person in 2 different browsers. Inception kinda deal. I didn't think of that. Or maybe I did. I mean, maybe we did?
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:39:32
No, it would not count. The bet is not about Gyft (even though Gyft is totally awesome). Me and PeahesorPears have been PMing, and I think it's a good idea to make the exact parameters of the bet more specific and then post them here. But anyways, PeachesorPears is correct.. Gyft has nothing to do with it.

We are waiting for a reply.

Absolutely NO connection, no. I didn't even see that user or his twitter. I didn't know that "oracle" is a sacred/copyrighted word! 
No, me and that person are not connected in any way (that I know of)
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:52:46
Actually, that's the least trivial (from an engineering perspective). I should know. 
EDIT: Upvoting for some love to devs
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:33:00
I don't think so.. but if there's a lawyer out there who could chime in, please do so.. and if I'm breaking anything other then corporate policy, then I might have to delete this :(
I don't want to go to jail...
Anyone with legal knowledge care to help? Or maybe I could rephrase my original post? PM me or post here please.

Warmer.. warmer!!! 
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:49:17
Nice. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:44:22
Yeah neither would I. If theres a lawyer with experience/insight in this matter, please PM me. I'll bitcointip.
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:13:39
+I am in too. (if you are).  PeachesorPears - I sent you a PM
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:01:38
I like this idea better. Can I DM/PM you?
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:37:53
This is not an article.. this is a post, by a person, on Reddit. Articles will come after Thanksgiving. And you can disregard if it bothers you ..it's not too complex..
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:46:20
? Dont understand the connection? There was a video on eBay's blog.. but that was several weeks (months?) ago and was a informative kinda thing. There's not some eBay/Starbucks evil conspiracy if that's what you're suggesting.. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:36:18
I figured this would happen. Ok.. just please refer back to this post in a little over a week por favor.
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:34:49
Thank you man. I'm a BTC enthusiast as well.. so it's exciting. I'm surprised at the people either calling me a troll or one guy said he hopes I get caught and fired!! That's rough. What's with all the harshness :-/ 
I even offered to bet 1 BTC and have Seans Outpost hold it in escrow
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:05:24
It's like a week away man. And you want me to get "caught and fired"?! Woah dude. Not cool. This subreddit actually wasn't as harsh if my memory serves me right. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:59:52
1) If I made enough, I would buy a shit ton of Bitcoins.. But I already have a decent amount actually. 
2) This is not an article.. this is a Reddit post, that you can choose to ignore my man.. and I can't speak for eBay. All big corporations do not have one giant pool of employees. I hope eBay/Paypal stay the hell AWAY from BTC actually.
3) I'm not going to sell my Bitcoins ever. I'm going to use them like I currently do.. that's kinda the point of Bitcoin (in my opinion.. but I'm biased)
4) ?? I'm not exchanging my coins for fiat..even after the USD value per BTC keeps rising. Some people are into it for that, and I'm cool with speculation, but that's not my thing. I actually believe in it. 
Other devs out there, who've ever worked very hard on a project that they really strongly believe in will understand where I'm coming from. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:41:44
Exactly. Sanity. Yes. Progress. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:52:10
Thanks. Likewise dude.
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:47:11
You're on. How can we set up a bet? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:41:30
For the final time, no, I am not that account, I have never seen that account or his twitter, and I didn't think the word "oracle" was trademarked by anyone. I even said sorry! You're an angry person man. You remind me of this one guy who used to post here "Reality4U".. that guy was just depressingly tragic. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:34:32
Yes.. I just created this account, and that too via a VPN. I'm not going to lose my job because I can't contain my excitement and posted on Reddit. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:33:37
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:21:01
It is a coincidence, I didn't even see your twitter handle! Ugh.. sorry, I wasn't trying to cyber squat! 
All - this person is absolutely correct, we have no connection, and it's a major coincidence. I was just trying to be anonymous and cool with my name. Clearly I'm not that innovative. Sorry to the other Bitcoin Oracle. We are not the same.
We could be long lost.. oracle cousins though? ;)
EDIT: just re-read your post. I'm not using your twitter name.. I didn't even see your twitter.. and I'm not trying to "pump up the price" because I don't think an over excited post on reddit can have any impact on the Bitcoin economy.. I just felt it was only a week away so what the hell. Again, I'm sorry if you think I intentionally used your twitter handle. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:42:40
Well.... some people would consider it inconveniently. But.. it was not for nothin'!
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:12:32
YouTube "Roxette" right now. Right. Now.
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:14:59
PeachesorPears idea of having Seans Outpost escrow and keep 10% is more in tune with something I'd be down with. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:31:16
7? I'm behind Hotspotshield and/or Spotflux. 
*Cue the people calling for my head for trying to engineer a Spotflux and Hotspotshield and Sbux and Bitcoin Conspiracy*
