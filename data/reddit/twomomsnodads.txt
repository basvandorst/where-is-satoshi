if debt is growth stolen from the next generation, then what to make of an economy and government based entirely on having something before you can afford to pay for it?

Sure can't, too many bloated government handouts the Boomers need funded. Can anybody get a hold of whoever promised to fund those State Pensions? Hope Mom and Dad aren't depending on the failing economies of the state to subsist them for 20-30yrs.

What if there is no income tax, but a 20% sales tax to compensate? We will all still be buying stuff, perhaps the heft of taxation needs to be present in that transaction instead of tied to your SS# and employer wages. I dunno, just bullshitting.

Sure, but the usd is not bullshit today. It still buys houses and healthcare and food and bitcoin. I think the idea is when the usd is revealed as a scam, and all confidence is lost, and all value is lost, bitcoin would still have value. Just like the house you bought with fiat.

Saying China sucks is not offensive to any Chinese people? Only White supremacists get upset when you shit on American foreign policy? Still don't see where the 'hatred and racism' came from. Stop posting this inane garbage.
