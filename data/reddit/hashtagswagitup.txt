The more people use it, the more demand goes up, the more value goes up (see the past 4 years and how value has grown along with number of users). The more people use it, the higher the market cap, meaning the market will be less volatile and larger funds will be needed to manipulate the market. 
So, the more users there are, the higher the value and the more stable the market will be.

This is true, burning coal also generates greenhouse gasses. However, it's easier to get green electricity than green oil. Solar, wind, geothermal, etc all will get more efficient and popular over the years. Electric cars are a stepping stone.

I think in larger cities income is usually greater for the same jobs. A IT guy might make 50k in a suburb but 75k in NYC, but likewise all the costs are greater as well.

This one, updated to the most recent version through the Play Store

I recommend the Nexus 5 if you don't need the gimmicky features of the s5 (fingerprint reader and heart rate sensor), its cheaper, has the pure Google experience without any bloatware, and IMO has better build quality.

Reimporting the key worked! Only took 3 hours for the transaction to show up, lol. Hopefully the problem doesn't persist, although I do like the more advanced features of Mycelium; maybe I'll just stick to that.

Yes, I'm using that one. Latest version 
@_date: 2014-10-03 23:00:56
It hasn't been at that price for 2 years though
@_date: 2014-02-01 20:51:56
Will give that a shot. I'm not too concerned since it was only a few dollars worth of btc, so if all my Mycelium addresses work, I'll just switch to that app instead. Sure is strange though.

To be honest, I'm not quite sure what the difference is. Probably both, but I'm I want to hear from people who "have their money where their mouth is". I feel like this people are more educated and well-researched in regards to whatever they are investing in.

The blockchain shows the transaction with 10+ confirms. It shows that the address got the payment. However, it still doesnt show up in the Received tab in the app. I restarted the app and reloaded the blockchain, no change.

They still have them, I got a replacement card in the mail a month ago. Haven't even activated it yet
