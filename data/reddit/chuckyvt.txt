Every other crypto currency has shown an ability to execute hardforks.  If it is impossible for the Bitcoin community to execute hardforks, the long term viability of Bitcoin is going to be suspect.

Just wanted to say, I completely agree.  The all or nothing thinking in the community is frustrating.

A base blocksize increase is the one method we know of that will immediately help transaction throughout, and reduce fees.  The bigger segwit block via the witness discount is fine, but as we are seeing, it is not trivial to implement and is going to take time.  Compromise isn't terrible.  A modest block size increase keeps things on the rails until more better longer term solutions are implemented.

Everyone so often someone floats the idea of reducing blocksize, and most laugh it off as being ridiculous.  At the same time, most laugh off the idea of increasing it above 1 MB, as if there is something magical about 1 MB.  (There's not).

There what, 11000 or so nodes.  Realistically what are we talking about here if Bitcoin went to 2MB base block size.  Dropping to 10K nodes?  9K nodes?   Seems like a worthwhile trade to be able to transactions with BTC again.

It's crazy to me that he is "toasting" the current state of the network.  The 1MB cap has but us way ahead of incentivizing network security via free market.  The 12.5 BTC coinbase reward is plenty to accomplish that, but fees are now doubling it.   The goal is free market via many transactions paying a reasonable fee, not a very few paying very high fees.

I lost 2 BTC on MtGox.  Thank god I had transferred the majority of my coins to Coinbase a couple months before.  I still feel terrible for the people that had large losses there.

This.

Miners probably wouldn't fight a larger blocksize, many  have advocated for larger blocks for quite a while.  Most agreed to Segwit2X quickly, it's getting some manner of consensus in the community that was/is the difficult part.

All great and good.  But can we also please consider a blocksize increase in 2018 as well?   It helps in the near term.  And LN isn't going to help if you can't open a channel relatively easily.
