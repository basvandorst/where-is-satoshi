I personally never complained about Coinbase being "too meddlesome"; KYC-AML regulations in the USA are very vague and incredibly hard to implement. 
I guess I'm not really being that critical of Coinbase and I take back my original comment to a degree; they are allowed to take customers' explanations at face value assuming there is nothing else they know that would contradict what the customer is saying. I would be curious how Big Vern explained that level of volume; did he claim those were his ownership profits from Cryptsy?

Assuming they are now insolvent and cannot otherwise drum up the funds, bankruptcy is the only option. I would hope their lawyers are telling them that they can't favor creditors if they are getting ready to file for bankruptcy; even allowing customers to withdraw their deposits if they can't make everybody whole would be a no-no.

You know what would be cool for the website with "zero fluff" to do? Provide a link to the auction website, not regurgitate a Reuters article. It took me all of 3 seconds to find it.

I don't see how that can be their position, regardless of what their ToS said. Yes, they're not liable if, for example, Bitcoin goes to $0 when in Bitfinex's custody because that's outside of the exchange's control... but that's not what we're talking about here.

A socialized loss ONLY for bitcoin-related balances? That's disfavoring one class of creditors for no legally justifiable reason (other than this class was unlucky and happened to be holding bitcoins at the time the hack occurred). This is asking for a lawsuit and/or an involuntary bankruptcy petition.

Only a few coins are Ulbricht's. This auction is mostly for other people's seized coins.
@_date: 2016-08-22 18:50:26
Fair enough. But then you're only talking about a very small percentage of BFX's customer base, possibly with no relationship to the customers who lost the most money from the hack (i.e., a billionaire might have only had a few hundred bucks on the exchange but an otherwise asset-poor day-trader might have had tens of thousands).
So they would be treating two different classes of creditors differently for no reason other than their net worth. Which comes with problems of its own.

So Cryptsy's CEO had a *personal* account at Coinbase used it to exchange US$3.3MM worth of bitcoins in 2.5 years into his personal bank accounts... and Coinbase didn't consider this at all suspicious before Dec 2015?

Yup. 
What constitutes "overwhelming consensus"? Consensus amongst whom exactly? 
I have seen the term "economic majority" thrown around but what exactly does that even mean? I don't think people who use it have even come to a consensus (heh) on what it means. The term barely exists outside of the Bitcoin world.
XT did not meet this standard even though 75% of hashing power seems like it constitutes an "overwhelming consensus" of an integral part of the network, in addition to being a good-enough proxy for an "economic majority" (in my opinion, it is indeed the *only* proxy for "economic majority" which can possibly exist, no matter how you define that term, despite it being merely good-enough). Miners are after all merely servants of the network. Indeed, the Bitcoin Wiki seems to say as much: "As long as mining is conducted for economic gain, then any change adopted by the miners needs to be supported by the economic majority for it to be successfully implemented."  It simply does not make sense for miners to use a Bitcoin client which generates blocks which nodes won't recognize.
Maybe if I had mod power over this subreddit things would make more sense.

Wow. This post is two hours old and it hasn't been removed yet? I thought BitcoinClassic is just an alt-coin... Shocking. 
Or is it because some (utterly bullshit and impossible to objectively quantify) "economic consensus" standard is being met and, therefore, it is not an alt-coin?

He shot himself in the foot by not properly challenging the seizure of the most damning evidence pre-trial. The judge even pointed out the strategy and was perplexed by it (but didn't speculate on whether the challenge would have been successful). A proper challenge -- if he lost it -- may have created problems for him if he was called as a witness in his own defense...but he didn't do that so the decision was a complete strategic loss overall.

Are these supposed to be comparable? They're not. You're referring to a Bitcoin protocol-level bug.
The DAO is a failed smart contract based on the Ethereum protocol in which there is a (proposed) hard-fork of the protocol itself to remedy its failings. It would be like the Bitcoin protocol being hard-forked today to undo customers' transactions into MtGox.
@_date: 2016-06-29 20:08:12
I doubt he had any belief he would ever run away with the funds as there was a large chance that a way would be discovered to deny him the money, not to mention the problem of trying to actually spend it.
He likely had large short positions on every exchange and came out handsomely ahead. I'm sure his identity could be figured out if you get an investigator or two with subpoena power on the case (which has likely happened).
@_date: 2016-06-23 15:00:19
Bitcoin and Ethereum are similar in one respect: they both allow for direct democracy to change the protocol.
With Bitcoin, that's hard. Always has been; the protocol changes only when a supermajority is on board and usually takes months to reach required consensus, unless there's a critical protocol bug. Hard forks are extremely rare and limited to correct specific issues.
With Ethereum, on the other hand, hard forks are in the Foundation's plan for the protocol so it's natural that the community would want to expand their use to fix issues not directly related to the protocol.

This is not entirely accurate. The Uniform Commercial Code allows for the invalidation of contracts that are unconscionable (i.e., so unfair and/or one-sided in favor of one party to be against public policy to enforce).
You could (easily, IMO) make the argument that the weakness that the attacker exploited makes the smart contract "unconscionable" and should be invalidated. 
That said, are the Ethereum developers or "community" the right ones to make this call of unconscionability? In the real world, these things are determined by relatively neutral judges, arbitrators and/or juries, not by people who have pecuniary interests in the outcomes (the developers were investors in The DAO), and we never let the popular masses determine outcomes in civil disputes.

Not just Ethereum but the whole concept of "smart contracts" took a hit this past week. Good. 
"Code is law" is an extremely dangerous proposition when the code is being used for sophisticated high-value commercial transactions.
@_date: 2016-06-26 21:54:48
This is silly.
Today, if a lawyer misdrafts a contract with an "or" instead of an "and" when the intent of the parties was clearly to say "and", the contract will be enforced with its intent in mind.
If a hacker in a smart contract does the same thing, the users of the smart contract are SOL.

This is not true. 
The IRS has determined Bitcoin is subject to capital gains as "property". Short term capital gains are taxed at identical rates to regular income; long term capital gains are taxed substantially less than regular income.
On the other hand, foreign currency gains -- the only other option available to the IRS to classify Bitcoin and it simply didn't meet the definition for foreign currency -- are *always* taxed as regular income.
At best, treating it as "property" is a wash tax-wise.
But I agree re: regulation. Any sort of US-based virtual currency futures market will now take years to get past the CFTC; it took years just to get regular exchanges out of a legal gray area.
@_date: 2015-11-25 22:13:28
Um. Property under the Internal Revenue Code is anything that isn't legal tender. So IRS "properties" includes CFTC "commodities".
