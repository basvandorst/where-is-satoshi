not your keys, not your bitcoin.
clearly by the looks of his replies, op is a kid. you say 1k, 1k what? if that is usd, then clearly you can buy hardware wallets.
you cant retrieve it even if you cry with blood. serve that as a lesson.

let me get my crystal ball
@_date: 2018-05-18 23:22:46
sure, i can make calls when power is out using "smart"phones, they have batteries now anyway. yeah, powerbanks/car chargers too. you cant bring your wired landline with you while traveling, do you? network overload? landlines have interruptions too, dont discount that. hmm, answering phone calls nowawadays is just one tap away, even toddlers can accidentally do that.
i can call even if im in bed, bathroom, almost literally anywhere.
there's just too much pros to cellphones vs landlines. so cellphones make it better. there are downsides to both, but cellphones have the upper hand.
@_date: 2018-05-10 20:02:31
@_date: 2018-05-22 06:01:19
@_date: 2018-05-18 23:06:27
wait, i cant take my landline in the bathroom, or else i'll break the wire. /s

@_date: 2019-10-07 03:34:06
sometimes it might go up or down, and later it might go up or down.
@_date: 2019-10-28 13:22:12

@_date: 2019-10-25 17:45:05

for the record, you never disclosed your seed to anyone nor to anywhere, correct? even then, you have passphrase, which i suppose, you also never disclosed it to anyone nor anywhere.
is there somebody by any chance could possibly have  physical access with your trezor while you were sleeping?
@_date: 2019-10-07 18:57:35
it may go up or down.
@_date: 2019-10-28 16:47:23

@_date: 2019-10-30 14:52:21
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:33:37

@_date: 2019-09-18 15:15:28

@_date: 2018-04-24 05:50:51

@_date: 2019-09-03 15:01:02

@_date: 2018-04-27 11:41:06

@_date: 2018-04-09 15:23:11
typical filipinos
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:42:33
what i mean with lost is the exchange might not be helpful. anyway, thanks for your help people.
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:36:17

@_date: 2018-04-26 05:36:38
ahhh not again
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:51:37
i dont know what cryptocurrency is all about anymore. i think we should call it "cryptoprofit" now. people always think about profit, not its purpose.
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:16:28
maybe another chineese new year or something?
@_date: 2018-04-21 16:34:50
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:32:51

@_date: 2018-04-24 06:28:24
so i should not be worried? its been 8 hours now without a single confirmation.
@_date: 2018-04-28 02:55:52
i think him alone is enough. i dont think nerd devs have the nerve and thick face to do what he is doing.
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:52:19
its all about meme.
