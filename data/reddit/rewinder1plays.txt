I'm seeing 13.5, if today is the day of breaking out, I don't see it touching the lower trend line anymore. 
Well fingers crossed :)
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:37:01
2 am UTC
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:29:21
Candles close 2am utc
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:10:07
Lol almost everyone takes a loan to buy a car I Europe. I love how you just throw around random crap without any facts.. oh wait I forgot we are on Reddit..
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:23:26
I was talking 22h hours l
Later lol. So it closed below just an hour ago. We'll see if it holds now.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:43:49
Simple facts of branding and development team size should reassure. Now that the news are unraveling about "Bitcoin hitting history's worst 36% market share" it'll probably resume the bull run.
In fact I'm having a small prediction that if it closes above 14k today, we are resuming our trajectory to Mars.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:19:01
You can still fund your account with BTC, which is what you would normally do. So thanks for clickbait news.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:36:00
I've noticed the same. Still a lot of people profiting out, I thought everybody (edit. W
who were planning to) would have done that by now - a lot of opportunities were given to exit around 15k..
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:40:11
Eth also.. I was expecting Eth (it'll get pumped to over 1k when/if the bull run resumes. But LTC I am not expecting to do any crazy movement but just get dragged up slowly with the next bull.
Eth gaining momentum. But I have a feeling the BTC pairs will be worse in a slightly longer run because of the recent growth..
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:25:37
Closed below so we might see it going further down once more, could not break the upper resistance for now..
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:05:17
This is going to blow off as a 2% blip. There are services that allow you to use your BTC in any online vendor.
We are on a bull train and the FUD is from mostly the people who have a fear that they missed out AGAIN on a 50% drop. 
Just fucking buy and hold with an amount you are not afraid to loose, and stop delivering your "expertise"" It'either going to be worth 0usd or a shit ton more than now.
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:24:23
How hard it is to Google 2am UTC. I actually said universal time. It closed below btw.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:27:29
Haha did Gdax crash again?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:37:58
Oh yeah and the obvious, just the buying volume was the last drop what I was waiting for.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:42:05
First of all, Bitstamp backlog of withdrawal is around a week. Depends on SEPA or not it takes a couple days more.
Second, I believe this must be either stupidity or fake news. "Open a support ticket" with 2 mil in withdrawal pending, give me a fucking break..
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:39:54
Bcash fan, ignore this dude :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:42:12
SHITTERS CLOGGED
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:35:54
Looked in to my crystal ball lol. Many variables, mainly what I've been saying for couple of days. 
- BCH pump is over (+ insider trading sell lol)
- Holidays beginning 
- Just another FUD driven correction like last time, there were no seriously troubling news (except the usual bubble and crash talk fucking everywhere haha)
Transaction times and fees FUD are identical to last BCH pump, being spammed as it were back then.
But do your own research always, don't believe a random straight up! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:10:16
Wow that push only required around 100 coins. I think some one person panicked and dumped his whole stash. Well he's probably regretting, even though he's a millionaire now ��
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:47:29
Umm what
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:18:29
He's calling the loud, inpatient ones salty idiots. Most of the silent ones who bought on the way are smart, patient and know the risks involved with volatility.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:56:32
Wow which exchange. Lucky bastard.. haha
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:36:43
I was waiting for this, I feel more relaxed now about my 30k(ish) ATH prediction, it requires a slow steady bull train over 20k during the holidays.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:36:23
People pump everything back in investments after gifts and such have been bought, it's been a yearly occurance. 
The price is clearly bottoming out atm. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:01:16
Welp. Support failed, going for another ride..
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:08:15
Lol agreed, same will happen as when the first fork happened. "Wow, it's not crashing - BUY BUY BUY". Until the CME i believe, then the volatility will start most likely..
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:15:27
Not any day soon tho. Futures FUD for crash did not happen, so money pouring back in until CME. My guess it's going to reach 20k before cme.. 
Infact It's about to break an important resistance in the next hours..
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:37:57
Sorry about my ignorant comment. I'm just fucking bored about the "FEES ARE SO HIGH, LIGHTING NETWORK WILL NEVER HAPPEN' comments in the sub. 
We all know this ride is all about greed but bitcoin will prevail after this bubble(?), and the next one. The technology WILL improve. Probably after it cools down after this hype is ended.
You should think about your investment though, maybe too much on the line? And please don't say "it's not an investment" I've heard that too many times. It will be an investment until it's a working product..
Have a nice day bud
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:43:12
Hahahah lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:30:02
Dip is over? Looks like support has been found and retested. The dips are getting quicker and quicker, we are officially parabolic... 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:03:38
First 12k. Pull back 10-11 then 15, thoughts?
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:34:06
Great video Seth!
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:20
Same here, maybe after breakfast I'll check the price.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:41:04
OK. That flash crash was nuts, any idea what triggered it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:49:35
That GDAX 1h tail must be the longest one I've seen haha..
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:28:38
Ah yes, the dip was cut short remember? 7800 -&gt; 5500 so 25%. I was off but there was that whale who did admit for cutting the fall short that time.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:22:09
Ah it might do one more push, there faked support for BCH at 3300. Somebody still manipulating..
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:03:05
Agreed, I don't really understand. People do make mistakes in life only to learn from them.
I was holding through the shit storm, even did a little increase here and there in BTC. But yeah, also had to learn from the past.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:56:44
It came and went away. Isn't this the time when it dropped 35% to 5500. So the prediction was somewhat correct :D 
Timespan wasn't tho lol..
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:53:29
Oh my...
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:22:15
Flagged because I said edit. "the other currencies" too many times. Prepare for the flood of cash pouring in back from the other cryptos.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:31:58
I've said it a couple of weeks ago. The question is when will they time the short. Immediately? Maybe, but they could stretch it out even to a 100k, thanks to this dumb "we are going parabolic" mentality. I'm more afraid of the market being totally destroyed and people losing their money to these future shorters..
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:07:06
FUD and a planned attack to pump BCH (as always), it's gonna blow over soon. 
BTC will probably pump after this near 30k over Christmas and New years.
When the price is dropping I advice stay out of Reddit :)
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:55:18
@_date: 2018-05-28 12:20:21
Nowish, 6800-7200
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:48:32
There was a tiny flash crash just now though which lowered the support, now it gotta retest that..
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:40:36
I'll have to agree or we come close, it'll probably settle somewhere around 3600 after the shit storm. Just take a look at how puny the resistance was going over 3K, the sell mania is over and I'm pretty sure shorters lost a ton of money today, thank god. The 5K mark isn't so laughable now, eh? 
Love this community btw, I've been lurking for a while nao :) Just my 2c 
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:50:13
Heyy this is my tune! 
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:44:38
Rice is a myth guys! Does not work. Silica gel is the best you can get for draining out moisture. Biggest problem is corrosion though, which can only be removed with isopropyl alcohol and rubbing. This applies for all electronic devices! Speaking out of work experience here :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:37:09
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:19:48
You know the drill, it's going to be a snowball rolling down the hill filled with FUD, false hope, panic etc.
It's a herd momentum and we have seen that over and over again..
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:34:23
Last time there was this much hopes and dreams there came China. Before that the 3k touch. Before the SEC disapproval. Reddit was full of hype and hopes of the next "10K!?!?!"
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:04:29
It has begun :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:41:57
Going big is a solid way to go :) Get a nano ledger while you're at it and keep it somewhere further away from your reach when you finally decide to jump in! This way you will not get itchy fingers and sell over time :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:15:40
Thanks bro!
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:31:38
This is the fastest (=worrysome) "correction" of all time so far.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:29:47
Nice. It's going to take a couple of days for them to process the first wave of registrations and deposits. Shits about to go down.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:48:45
It's not done tanking, wait 2 weeks. Patience
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:31:04
First step is behind, long level has been breached.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:25:07
A whale is trying to push it over on BitFinex though
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:41:31
And literally is useless for the time being and pure speculative store of value. This fomo is crazy..
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:14:33
I'm sorry to be the bad news bearer.. Just think about it for a second. I'm just here with an opinion to get traders to think about possibilities. LONG is safe ofcourse, but this bear might be a longer one too. (1-2 months)
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:38:16
Lol so painful? You are going to be a happy man in a week.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:42:34
We might not see under 5-6k prices anymore though, just a heads up..
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:50:59
Withdrawing my 9K prediction because the s2X delay..
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:04:39
I agree loosely with the correction levels, it even might touch 4000. For a long though I don't think the bull run is over and the exponential amount of people joining the crypto community will not keep the price low for long :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:17:02
I'm afraid..
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:59:39
This was my prediction with the S2X going through. A correction would have happened somewhere at the end of Nov. Now it's imminent..
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:57:08
Withdrawing all positions. Not talking in hundreds 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:06:56
Good talk.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:32:18
I have a bad feeling about this. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:18:36
I'll take an educated guess that it's not over. All the respect to BTC but just a warning to be wary for the next 1-2 days.. Longers relax and hodl, take a cold beer and close internet for a week.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:31:01
It's weird to me that selling high is always talking about getting losses. You have already made a profit at that point and only if you buy higher and sell low after you'd be making a loss in fiat.. I guess people don't think fiat as a currency anymore, maximizing crypto amount?
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:30:56
This pump might go over 0.4 BTC value.. frightening..
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:52:11
Regrets are coming when it hits 9K
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:56:13
Sure for a few more minutes until the fake pump is over.. No point on holding BTC now for hopes of securing position for both forked coins. 
Sad news but inevitable correction now in the works.. BTC would be better off without this s2X shenanigans.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:54:57
Few weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:43:32
Just a note for anyone who cares to have a conversation.
I've been pretty accurate with my estimates if you care to look through my posts :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:00:27
SORRY! Forgot to post my usual disclaimer! 
Do not take investment advice online. Do your own research and risk control your assets.

Sucking in moisture in an environment where moisture is not wanted and before it condensifies in to liquid. Shoes, clothing etc..
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:30:29
Thanks. 
A tweet got me thinking originally so I asked. Might be serious, might just blow over as fake news..
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:54:12
Agreed.. patience, patience people.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:13:39
It'll shoot past 8k in a day, next (last mostly certain one IMO) stop 9k
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:12:49
Wow all this confidence that the dip is over.. What is going on?
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:24:13
Yeah you can call him too at 1800-cryptohelp
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:27:41
You're funny
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:51:06
It's gone in to a bear, just be honest with your self and ask the question "why did it go up to 7.5k?"
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:23:59
I've tried to tell people lul
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:20:37
Exactly. It seems that the time associated with the word patience is now days reduced to 6 hours or so..
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:01:20
Long for sure, no worries. Keep hodling guys :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:05:43
I find it funny when I get down voted for a fair warning! Remember I posted this while the bull pump was happening.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:27:58
I love making bear trade profits. +8% today already, no worries here :)
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:39:51
Welcome to the club! If I'm right, just the short squeeze alone will shoot it 9-10k..
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:04:49
How do you reckon?
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:12:30
I lolled at the death cross news too btw
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:29:10
Thank you man.
@_date: 2018-03-31 08:30:15
Well seems like I'm the only one who put my money where my mouth is..
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:21:58
Do you have a reason for why it's still bearish? Where is your counter point?
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:33:26
I checked, up 5%
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:57:22
Lel, I made a nice 3,7% profit on that uptick. In this market it's all about trading you pleb. What is the problem with people understanding short term predictions :D
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:34:38
The source seems to be bitstamp for some reason, whenever the price lowers and sell orders cave in, something or one eats them all at once and in rare occasions the market reacts by causing a buy wave.
It's been happening for a couple of days now, today even more consistently.
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:13:05
I will thanks! You hodling beast you ;)
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:00:06

Have you shorted?
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:33:40
haha thought you were sarcastic all in. gg
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:17:12
This trend im seeing now is why I'm buying. Most people are confident that it'll rise, they are just waiting for the dip and selling and buying lower.
I love looking trends and psychology of them and the trend is definetly bullish all over Reddit. 
People defending their trade attempts of trying to buy in lower is a good indicator that the tide will turn around rather rapidly in the coming weeks :)
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:50:51
It's just a short term prediction, nothing delusional rofl.
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:24:29
Instead of unnecessarily commenting on a shitpost about a matter that has no relevance to the conversation, why not just not comment in the first place?
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:01:48
Haha dyor
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:56:44
Gotta admit I was a little naive about the amount of greed in this market, can't people turn short term bearish? Happened to me when price broke support on 14th. I'm opening a long position again at 4-5k
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:24:14
I was talking about the clearly individual/s whale buy walls, that got eaten up :)
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:08:50
And liftoff.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:32:32
That I would call a good trade. I'm just saying that big buyers are stepping in, and when that happens.. well you've seen it before.
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:06:22
Thank you for letting me know! This post is irrelevant with that new information.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:21:12
But it is going to?
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:40:17
Dirty money exchanging hands?
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:47:30
They might look what I call fomo spikes, I've never seen so many in a day though.
And a couple of bigger players are clearly FOMOing too, not many large sell orders has been placed today.
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:10:28
This does not look like a bull trap this time. Well we'll see in couple days!
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:33:06
In matter of minutes lol. Welcome to crypto I guess.. Also millions of any currency lost and won by traders just because of this one guy.
There was absolutely no reason, so I guess it was some lucky guy drunk or high overreacting..
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:15:33
I would rather see a week-month lasting recovery, not a straight up fomo launch. Btc needs a stable trend to build a base for traders.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:19:00
Same all over Europe. These yanks don't research before they open their mouths..

I still see trading on Huobi and OKcoin for example?
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:25:12
What the fuck is your problem. What is so hard to comprehend about "short term".
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:59:24
Quick rebound, slow rise. You've seen it before too. Maybe a dip or two in between because of itchy fingers but volume is too big before the "pump" for just a blip. I may as well be wrong, just my 2 cents. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:22:09
There has been of "ITS OVER 9000" for the past 4 days...
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:59:35
That's literally what I said..
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:37:40
Well put a !remind up, I'm curious my self too obviously haha. Just a new kind of volume and activity mixed with some TA and a pinch of gut feeling.
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:34:23
Mostly bitcoin core update, but the timing of this is impeccable though haha
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:14:40
It's still there.. Chinese volume isn't decreasing either, which I was most afraid of. We will see what happens, this is more of an exciting event for me this time around. Been getting quite good results for past months :) I love the difference in opinions tho, makes it all the more interesting!
@_date: 2017-09-26 01:55:10

@_date: 2018-02-22 13:27:42
Not kidding, i trade. Just calling the bottom on this latest cooldown now.
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:05:44
I found the source, thank you for letting me know! The table has turned indeed, I must now delete this post. It's all for the good finally.
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:44:18
Sorry I meant the price being +10% off us and eur trade prices is the reason. And yes, there is an absolute impossibility for a regular Chinese citizen to make a buck out of this. I presume zejayt, you have never been to China. I have and I do know a few upper mid class folks, and they can't even imagine of doing business in anything else than CNY without being regulated and monitored heavily. It is a closed country when it comes to business and trading. Only straw of luck I can imagine if they have family aboard, then that might be a possibility.
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:02:29
It's a spy!
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:10:28
This does not look like a bull trap this time. Well we'll see in couple days!

Am I uninformed or you? I read two operators are continuing operation for 1.5 more months? If that is so, I will have to reassess..
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:21:22
+/-10 % would be a correction to my assesment. Didn't expect the reaction to be so violent to obvious news that every Chinese should already now! I sometimes forget how impulsive and dumb Chinese upper middle class is in stock and crypto hahha.
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:56:47
Yeah oversold rsi combined with some other indicators is one of my favourite and easiest ways to make a few percent extra.. GL man thanks for the support :)

@_date: 2018-02-23 00:30:29
And all it took was a 1.5% price drop, think about that. Sellers were mostly smaller traders, with one 500 btc panic seller, wonder who that was :D

I had to reassess due to new info about the Chinese exchanges! Dip or not, the original post is now obsolete.

You can downvote me after November lul

Well if that is true then my argument is invalid. F**k me.. The table might turn after all. Can you find me a source for that?
Edit. Argument is invalid for the most part. Correction for the bounce back is most likely inevitable but it might not test 3k in the case if no more CNY withdrawal or deposits are available..

I've just never seen the price react so violently hundreds of times per day, something new is going on. Maybe a larger whale buying with a bot?
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:21:22
+/-10 % would be a correction to my assesment. Didn't expect the reaction to be so violent to obvious news that every Chinese should already now! I sometimes forget how impulsive and dumb Chinese upper middle class is in stock and crypto hahha.

I'm not being mean, just sarcastic. Hopefully the dip sellers will learn.

Yes it is, one of the reasons I came to believe this bounce back rode too high too. 
Mainly I'm afraid because Chinese volatility just dropped dead after the rise, lead me to believe that big bucks made their �� for this bounce back and holding off or shorting on for another dip. (It was night time in China, mostly bigger traders watch the markets). Usually activity is WAY higher at night, which means regular mid-upper-mid class bought with the bounce during their evening.. we'll see yet again how it goes. This is short time assesment, I believe in BTC and in long bull for crypto.

It's going to get crazy. The breach of long high level will drive the price up like crazy. Shorters trying to recoup some of their losses, panic buying. Timing will be impossible but I do believe that something around 9K is not an issue.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:02:42
This man sees it too. It's was a huge buying force and people just kept selling and selling... Pigs getting slaughtered :D
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:32:15
And please spare me the "double bottoms", I know and I'm going against some of my analysis on ta because I'm seeing something new. Looks like brand spanking new money is entering. First time since Dec

That's literally what I said..
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:35:39
I trade bitcoin to get more bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:12:36
9k here we go.
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:51:54
I trade, uptick as in one day. Not long-term prediction
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:46:39
you doo, but usually when just browsing and in a minute it's changed. sure my heart skips a beat :D
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:28:41
FUD will be there, BTC price will start to increase soon. It'll shoot past high resistance levels setting a new trend line for those levels. Panic buying will start at 6-7k, which will be push it higher. 
We may reach even numbers around 9k in near future. Definitely a correction will be due by then.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:13:49
9k soon.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:23:03
Only now it would have been a worst possible trade, no indicator would have saved you of buying before it rebounded over 9900, hence FOMO buying what we are seeing now.
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:11:31
First short squeeze just happened, hope you holding still. I'm aiming at least 7500-800 at first after that 7400 stop sell. I got lucky and opened another long 6450 lol.
