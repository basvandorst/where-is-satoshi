I prefer Pepsi, but I'm not trying to call it Coke and support a crooked company that does for personal gain.

Go Bitcoin. To hell with the rest of crypto.

Media? I think it was on here.
Haven't watched TV or read a newspaper in about a decade :)

I guess that's what I was getting at.

"There were several crypto-billionaires in attendance"
Sounds like BS to me. Apart from Satoshi, weren't the Winklevoss twins meant to be the first crypto billionaires?  I seem to remember that only being called recently, probably when BTC price was much higher than it is now.

Just ignore the idiots.
You literally got downvoted for posting concrete proof.

Try going into a sub for doctors or any other highly specialized area, and poking holes in their established consensus after seeing maybe a few sensationalist 2 minute reports in the news about their field.
Thats pretty much what happens when people from r/all come and spout shit about bitcoin.
Lots of people here have been studying bitcoin for much longer than a doctor needs to study to qualify. Hand in hand with that generally goes a solid understanding of economics.
As I say, test it out, find a highly specialized sub, rock up and start telling people the consensus is wrong, without even being able to explain why in a way that would convince anyone other than a rank amateur.

 &gt;Where's the lie?
What % of all bitcoin moved do you think goes via ATM?
No one is paying $20 in transaction fees unless they want to, just like no one is stopping you from from finding the most expensive listing for a particular item on ebay and purchasing from that seller.
As you can see the *average* fee right now is about 3USD.  Don't forget to take into account that most people are still over paying.
I bought something yesterday (Yes it's a currency, I even got a 20% discount against fiat), when I sent payment my ledger wallet suggested 6sat/byte.
