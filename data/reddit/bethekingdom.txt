I'll post tomorrow to see what happens. Hopefully it works out.

I don't think you realize how great these jeans are. Yeah, you can go get your run of the mill (hehe) type of jeans at Old Navy, or Gap no problem, but you're not going to get the quality that these give. Those are mass produced without any care. These are hand made in batches of 50. I've seen the jeans being made, I've even helped in the process.
On top of that, they are made with selvedge denim rather than regular denim. selvedge denim (if you didn't read the link I posted) is made from looms which are no longer made anymore. Selvege denim has a much higher thread count, you might say. They are way denser than normal denim jeans. Once you break them in, theyre the most comfortable, multi-use "pair of pants" you can get.

Does this work with Litecoin? Also, I am using Windows and know next to nothing at all about Linux
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:20:56
Good idea. I'll do that now. Thanks for the idea!
EDIT: nothing.

Bitmit does have an escrow system, and it's very safe to use.

Level 3 requires your full ssn (kept on file at all times), your actual fingerprints, a copy of your passport, a blood sample, and a sample of at least 10cm^2 of of your skin.
They ***need*** to know it's you.'

I tried 5 different times, each with a different answer for that question.. None of them worked. I had to wait until I got one that didn't include that question, then I got it on the first try.

First thing from Cincinnati that I've seen that's bitcoin related. keep it up

Thanks for the link, man.

It's a pair of jeans that you cherish, they ARE expensive, I know that! Simply, put, you get what you pay for. If you think $30 jeans are worth it, by all means go for it! I do not care what your wardrobe consists of. Having one pair of jeans you buy for life is definitely worth spending extra cash.
If you can't afford it, don't buy it.

I'd love this

I feel like he was trying to imply there would be legal consequences
@_date: 2013-03-14 13:42:06
What would the implications be if he did run with the coins?

Okay. Will it work if I just try Ubuntu without installing it? I'm pretty sure that's an option at the boot menu
