in the EU it's not illegal, cause you are the owner of the bill. That means you are allowed to do whatever you want to. BUT nobody have to accept a tainted bill. That means in the worst case you lose the amount of money the bill is worth, casue nobody wants your bill. BUT also the central banks have to exchange your tainted bills with new one, if you didn't marked the bill or they can't proof that you marked the bills.

I was at a conference Last weekend. There, one of the speakers, Professor of Risk Management, said that the BTC itself is by definition deflationary, but all the serious forks are a kind of inflation. This is a very interesting point that may be worth discussing, but it would be a new kind of inflation. Why should one print more dollars for an inflation, one could also bring out a second dollar, which differs clearly by appearance etc, which the leaders gladly spend.

If a seed is preinstalled just re-set up and generate new seed. Ledger himself has pictures on the internet page that look like the inside of a ledger. who says there is still a hardware between being switched, can its open and compare with the pictures!
