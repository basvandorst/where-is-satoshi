holy smokes, you do not have money invested when switching search engines. If you went from google to askjeeves, you are not moving capital when doing so. You are hung up on fees, that's not what I addressed. I understand that there is no cost when switching coins. Great. The problem is the financial risk. That's the problem. A person doesn't not have to worry about making a bad "trade/switch" when choosing a freaking search engine. Yes, there is a reward if you make the right switch, the right trade, but non of that comes into one's mind when picking a search engine. Again, financial risk, not fees. C'mon man you can't be this dense.

search engine choice or investing in cryptos.
Which one of these can you lose money on? One has no risk the other has a lot.
Edit: to help you understand even further. Which search engine do I have to invest money in to use?
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:23:59
Wasn't talking about switching at all. You are not really switching are you? When you start using one search engine over another, there is no financial risk. That's why the comparison is ridiculous.
The risk is trading to another coin and for that coin losing value comparatively from what you had initially.  Also, hoping from coin to coin trying to chase gains will turn you broke quick. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:20:27


right because when I switch search engines I'm randomly choosing from 100s and if I pick the wrong one I have the possibility to lose half my money... great comparison
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:26:42
The value is in relation to bitcoin. Bitcoin is in increasing in value comparatively to other altcoins.  Each altcoin is priced as BTC.  The supply, market cap and price are all factored in for all coins

what's preventing crooks right now putting counterfeit dollars into bitcoin ATMs? North Korea is the largest producers of counterfeit US dollars, they could easily launder fake USD and buy bitcoin as we speak.  
The problem with your analogy is demand. Let's say that Binance prints a billion Tethers. Who are they selling it to? Answer, people who have bitcoin or other crypto to trade.  Now ask yourself, how did those people obtain their bitcoin/crypto?  They probably bought it with fiat money.  Demand has to flow into the exchanges or the price of tether would drop to zero.  
If you look here:
notice that the price fluctuates but it is settling for around 1 USD.
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:34:50
I'm all for bitcoin but, you are not going to win over anyone with this opinion, sorry but you sound like a cultist. If both bitcoin and the price of random house both drop to zero, the person with the house at least has a place to live.  At least that is what the majority of the population sees. To try to convince them other wise is idiotic.  You should just stick to the reason why bitcoin is needed, rather than comparing to what someone else has invested.

Slavery, indentured servants, having a job. All the same right? No need to define parameters, or the scale of individual human suffering... 
There are actual slaves today in a number of countries, and your concern is what? People getting paid not to work?  
Again, stop diminishing real slavery. It's fucking offensive. If you want to talk about social programs that help people who are underprivileged, then go ahead. But quit using hyperbole. It's not helping the cause. When people hear you equate having a job with slavery, they are laughing at you and thinking you are a complete idiot.

The health care system in the US has saved far more lives, and ever other country on the planet has benefited. The US subsidizing the majority of the worlds medical advancement. If it were not for these breakthroughs the majority of the world would be decades behind. Saving millions of lives.
 
And that is not even accounting for charities, the Gates Fund alone, has saved millions upon millions of lives, which has had no help from the government.
So again your numbers do not add up when comparing, and your article has proves nothing. Unless you got another one hidden in your sleeve.
It's weird how all these communist ideologies wind up as a totalitarian regime, huh? All based on Marxist ideology. All of them. You live in a country where capitalism keeps you fat and full but would never live in a place like Cuba or Venezuela. Heck you wouldn't even live in a food commune, where people are paid equally. You are a fraud
You think communism would work... You are what is wrong with this world, and history proves it again and again. You would send people to the gulag and forced labor camps to seek "justice" you would let people starve to death, so people would have equal pay, and prop up a regime. Kudos to you.

No one is arguing for it, but it's naive to think that socialist/communist aren't the ones who want control of the "whip".


There are so many examples feudalism through history with so many wildly varying degrees of freedoms and sovereignty or lack there of.  The change out of feudalism was not from progressive ideology but from the industrial age and the push of technology. In the modern era, kings or queens are basically mascots for said nation, and prime ministers are the ones at helm.  To think it will revert back to this after the industrial AND information age is silly.  


How is a country that has made drug use/trade illegal an example of ancap?


an example of virtually zero property rights, and the general population choosing nomadic herding vs large scaling farming, coupled with massive foreign food aid crushing the stability of stationary farming.
Not too sure how ancaps feel about property rights, but I'm sure there is some nuance to it.

That article is about projected numbers and not what has occurred. So you have failed to bring any evidence to the table. 
When people talk about communism killing millions, it is a direct result of it, not indirect result.  When communist governments take seize land, and force farmers to make steel or force them to sell their harvest at unsustainable price, that is a direct result. When communist governments put millions of people in gulags for political decent and force them into labor. 
People do not die directly in the health care system in the US. They go bankrupt. You will not be turned away if you go to a emergency room. Million have had their medical bills forgiven due to the inability to pay for them. There are literally thousands of charities to pay for medical expense. Again, no one has ever been turned away from an emergency hospital. So sorry that link does not prove anything that is being discuss.

It varies A LOT from country to country. AGAIN, the US already has healthcare for the people who need it the most. Poor, Elderly, and disabled.  Everyone else has enough resources to get the healthcare in need. Seriously you can't be this dense.

These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.
Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.
1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes. 
2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax. 
3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance. 
4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels. 
**5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.**
6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State. 
7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan. 
8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture. 
9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country. 
10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children’s factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, &amp;c, &amp;c.

The government.
Just as the federal reserve and centralized banks have controlled currency, the government has control over businesses. The misconception is that the government levels the playing field with regulations and laws, but unfortunately the outcome is that companies use those laws to stifle small business or to cut out competition. If you want a better understanding of why so many people that support bitcoin support free markets, look into Milton Friedman. There are a ton of great videos on YouTube, especially the ones where  he debates an audience who oppose his views. He also predicted the idea of bitcoin in 1999.

The US stock market is up from the great depression, it's up from the 2008 crash at an all time high. So by your logic since the US stock market is at an all time high from both of those crashes, then there was really no bear market. If you were to tell people that they would laugh in your face.  It is fucking idiotic.  It also makes people extremely wary to invest when you have people like you touting that there has never been a bear market in bitcoin, because you sound like an idiot.

You are misconstruing corporatism with free markets. When governments try to regulate markets they only create inefficiencies, which in turn companies turn into advantages in those very same markets, making them more powerful. That is what creates corporatism.

OK in your scenario, How will traders who have money in tethers affect the market, when tethers suddenly vanish?
With MTGOX the bitcoins were stolen and sold on the market. Hundreds of thousands. 
So walk me through it step by step, If tethers completely disappeared then what? Who is selling what?
The only thing I can see is the trust of the exchanges with tethers being damaged when this falls through, but that lesson was learned with MTGOX.

If tethers were the only other asset one could trade for bitcoin, then I would agree with you. But that isn't the case. You can trade it for a majority of fiat currencies on an number of exchanges, in addition to ALL of the other cryptocurrencies. 
How do you think tethers works? Why do you think it exists?  People wanted to trade in cryptos, but because of the volatility, they also wanted to hedge against it and park the value in fiat (Mostly US dollar), seeing how it's the least volatile comparatively. Banks saw this and thought it wasn't good (Banks aren't on board funding something that will rendered them obsolete), so they stopped doing business between the exchanges. Exchanges said fuck it, we will just create an asset tied to the US dollar. That's what happened. 
If you go on the exchanges and buy USTD, and it's tied to the value of the US dollar, how are you increasing the value of bitcoin? AND you are also claiming that it is only bitcoin that is being pumped by tethers when anyone can buy any alt with tethers on the exchanges.

How? Tethers market cap right now is $645 MILLION against bitcoin's 131 BILLION. When MTGOX happened it was trading 70% of all bitcoin trades. USTD (tethers) is not just traded on Bitfinex, but almost all exchanges that trade alt coins. In addition to that, they are traded with all other alt coins. See here:
If Tethers does go down, all exhanges AND alts will take a hit, and seeing how small the tethers market cap is compared to the whole crypto economy, I can't see it making an impact anything comparable to MTGOX.
Also were there any alts being traded on MTGOX?

Again I was only addressing the fact that it will not be MTGX 2.0. Won't even come close. 70% of the Bitcoin supply was stolen and sold on the market. Also for tethers/bitcoin it's less than 16%, because of the alts. Now walk through the scenario, tethers vanishes on the market. What happens? Who is selling what? No one is selling tethers. They are gone. They weren't real in the first place. That's what everyone is worried about. So what happens? Explain the scenario and give some numbers.

nope, in the free market, companies only have the profits that they make to re-invest back into the company.

maybe computers, but right now it's between the free market, which leads to capitalism, or having a third party, which will always   be a government entity which leads to socialism.
Also, you do realize you are in a sub for bitcoin, which was created to function as a free market, right? To function outside of centralized authority.

You mean the developing countries of the sons and daughters of farmers? Those countries lifted millions out of poverty.  They have choice between working at a factory or working on a farm. If the factories were not there, than what? What would they be doing? Living in a utopia? They would be farmers like their parents. They choose to work in a factory because they deem it to be a better path. If it wasn't they would not work there, they would work on a farm.


Examples? You got any?


private security does not compare to any nations army in any shape or form. how many of these private securities have tanks? missiles?  Do you know the cost of a sizeable army, with proper weaponry over years to be effective? It's in the trillions, there are no companies or corporations even close to have that.
You are failing to see that a majority of people will not risk their life unless it's for a noble cause. Are you going to risk your life for microsoft? Or would you risk your life for country or higher cause? 
The fact is without the government these companies would fold and become bankrupt if people were that anger to fight against them through violent means, and if they have that much anger they would surely have enough movement for boycotts. Just google "banana republic", and see how the United Fruit Company was on the brink of being overthrown due to exploitative practices.

He's right about the scarcity of cryptocurrencies, but bitcoin is not all cryptocurrencies.  You could also make the same argument for the US dollar. That it has no real scaricty because other countries can make their own currency, nevermind inflation and quantitative easing. Same goes for gold, it has no scarcity because there are other metals and elements that exist. 
Bitcoin itself has scarcity because it is coded in, 21 million only. Even if someone were to change that code, bitcoin would fork and the original bitcoin with a 21 million set limit would still exist. This 21 million limit will always exist. Gold on the other hand might one day be completely devalued by the discovery of massive gold deposits either here on earth or somewhere else.

This is more along the lines of Tethers or using the USD for a default currency.
 
"The first step of the plan was to create a virtual currency, the real unit of value, or URV, of which was roughly set at a par to the US dollar."
Before that Brazil had changed currencies 5 times to unsuccessful stop inflation/hyperinflation. By using a URV people could see what the value of something was at the grocery store and everywhere else.  So instead of using the USD when the currency fails (which usually is the case with smaller nations) they created their own virtual currency that was basically tied to the USD sort of like what Tether is to cryptos.
This was only successful because the USD was strong and stable, but would have failed if the USD were to suddenly fail.
