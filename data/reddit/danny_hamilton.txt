All of the local animal shelters, animal hospitals, and county animal control have been notified. Several friends and family drive and walk around the neighborhood whenever they have time.
I just happen to have some bitcoins, and figured I'd see if I can get a few more people in the area looking around by offering a reward.  Then I cross-posted to various local subreddits.

Social media (such as fourms, reddit, and facebook) are good for getting information to a large number of people very quickly.
Another user took it upon themselves to cross-post to the bitcoin subreddit, which I certainly appreciate.
