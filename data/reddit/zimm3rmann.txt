With solar it will probably never break even. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 13:57:52
You'd be better off purchasing Bitcoin still. Power cost is a huge factor in mining ROI and solar is a very expensive way to do this.

Right? I have less than 6 BTC and still keep that shit in a TREZOR

That's the thing, these people who blow up over stuff aren't feminists. Feminism is all about equality, but the people who get upset over stuff like this don't want equality, they just hate men. This tumblr variety of feminism is to equality as terrorists groups are to Islam. They are completely missing the point and are extremest in achieving their goals.

You wouldn't have to cash out all the BTC, just at least 1 million USD of it. You could do this fairly quickly without serious effects on the exchange rate. 
@_date: 2015-05-02 16:20:28
Here is some of it 
@_date: 2015-05-27 13:19:37
Still pretty trivial to do, and they don't show the advantages of using their "Cloud" platform over Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:39:15
Every exchange has some security risks, and it makes sense that they wouldn't immediately announce what was exploited, especially if there's an ongoing investigation. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 00:40:38
That would be neat. Google Wallet NFC payments already use a virtual card. You could select Coinbase and then tap and pay with wallet and have your BTC converted to USD on the spot. Not a true Bitcoin payment but it would make it a lot more useful.

Hahaha, hadn't heard of that one before. I'll stick to my Trezor after reading this part 
"The Glacier protocol requires over $600 in equipment, and approximately 8 hours of work to perform
an initial cold storage deposit."
Now if I had millions worth of bitcoin it would be something I'd consider but for 99.99% of the world it's excessive.

They probably create a request to some remote server that signs the transaction. I highly doubt there's any kind of wallet in the machine.

Mine shipped on the 20th and I don't have any info either. Kinda frustrated because I didn't see anything about where it shipped from when purchasing. I would have paid a bit more and gone with amazon.

@_date: 2013-12-06 02:26:47
That's fine. I'm against the fact that the US Government siezed those coins, but as a supporter of the openess of Bitcoin, I would gladly accept them. Rejecting certian coins is a bad path to start down.

The difficulty will be higher. Every day that a shipment is delayed (over a year for many) is a day they would have been making money. If you get it in November, it will talk a lot longer to turn a profit than last summer.

With a true free market, there likely not be massive corporations like Monsanto.

Right. Bitcoin is divisible to very small amounts, just like the US dollar. You can't do much with just one of your penny / fraction of a bitcoin. BTC .00007 won't really buy anything, just like a single penny won't buy much. You also wouldn't move a  single cent between banks.

I feel ya. I got interested in Bitcoin for a brief time when it was around $8-9 and then forgot about it. I bought 10 coins back then, and ended up loosing my wallet. I heard about it breaking 75 last week and I have been watching it. I really regret losing the wallet and not buying more.

Well, it depends on if you are doing pooled mining or not. With this miner, if you started mining today you would make about $19,000 this month. They say it won't be delivered till December, which by then you would make about $3,000 that month, $2,000 the next month, and about $1,000 the next month. Realistically, knowing BFL's history, you won't see these till the middle of next spring at the earliest. By then you might just barely make ROI.

That sucks. The only reason I made this post is because I saw sooo many negative things about them when doing a search on here. I'd guess that the volume they are processing when the value is fluctuating that much makes it very difficult to not make mistakes. I bought now because it's been stable for a bit.

I like that its a microcontroller instead of a raspberry pi. Yeah you can tweak more stuff on the Pi, but it's also hackable. I guess you could just not connect it to internet, but still. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 16:36:40
The payment is through moneygram. There's nothing special about it being a transaction to get bitcoins.  
@_date: 2013-08-06 16:24:57
I'll take an XL gray one. PM me on Reddit with the address as I don't have a bitcointalk account.
Thanks! 
Edit: From the time I posted this comment to the time the shirt shipped was around 2 hours. Bitcoin is amazing.

Wow, that's quite the tip these days. You're awesome! 
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:53:28
It's a closed platform, so there is no way of knowing what they can and can't do. I'd imagine they could remove an app. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 13:52:52
Exactly 
@_date: 2013-07-21 19:10:00
Only better performance for users who wish to use TOR. Mojority of people don't need the anonymity when buying BTC. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 23:28:30
Thanks a lot for doing this! I've bought 3 from you so far (still waiting on one), and look forward to making it 6. 
@_date: 2013-09-21 19:43:37
I'll do it for cash if you are in the US. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 06:59:22
Because, spending Bitcoin is good. It's not all about profit for some people, many like to just use it as a currency at it's current value. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:12:04
I like the theory that Satoshi is multiple people and Gavin is one of them. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 03:12:11
Along with 1/3 of the games that I already own.

Also he's a bit of a fatty. I'm 6'2", 200lbs and still a bit overweight.

They occasionally do stuff like bongs and vapes and stash containers. I don't think there's a category. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 02:04:19
Air filtration via static possibly?

You can't update through other means. Your main OS components come from Apple and are closed source. They aren't terrible computers, but I would personally never pay the premium price for them. And while they may be attractive in some aspects, the use of skeuomorphism is pretty atrocious in my opinion. I use macs quite a bit at work, and adobe software runs well on them so I can't really complain on that front. I like having privacy though, and in that case my only real options are GNU/Linux and BSD. With all this NSA stuff going on, I wouldn't use an OS that isn't open source.  
@_date: 2013-06-02 21:35:12
There is only $1.20 in it. 
If it was a couple BTC, someone might try all the combinations, but I don't think you can get it from this. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 00:01:21
French people, man.

Dude you run such a good business. So much respect. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:02:53
Then someone will make a TI84 with an ASIC peripheral and the arms race will start all over. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:58:00
Right, that's a mobile device though. On personal computers this has not been an issue in the past. Sure, windows does it with UAC but that's a bit less obtrusive. On OSX it's adding in an extra step that was not previously there. The first time I was setting up my mac at work and I went to install firefox and it stopped me from doing so I was pretty frustrated. What they have now is not horrible, but I fear the direction that personal computers are headed. Closed platforms like Windows RT and IOS are probably the direction that Microsoft and Apple would like to take personal computers too. In the future you might not be able to install anything they don't want you to, which is pretty terrible. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 13:33:37
Wow, I never knew about the Linode hack. I won't be using them anymore. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 05:22:04
Yep, pure luck. Nothing to do with hashing power, haha. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 00:27:14
Why would they want to take over though? People would just stop using Bitcoin. It would quickly be worth nothing. In their current situation, they are making good money and will be making more and more in the future. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 04:58:35
Don't buy from him then? 
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:19:37
This. You don't need crazy hashing power to confirm transactions. People would take over just to keep Bitcoin alive. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 03:50:27
I told the lady at CVS that I had no idea how this stuff works. She showed me where the phone was and everything on there was automated. The only difficult part is you need to make the amount you key into the phone the total amount (with fees). Other than that, it's super easy. Buying $96 worth and only paying $6 in fees works for me. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:58:08
I'm not sure if I have anything in this account, but if I do you can have it. 
+ALL verify

You can always tip the custom payment address that is generated for your transaction. 
@_date: 2013-07-20 21:21:05
Only if its SHA256, and most are Scrypt. 
@_date: 2013-06-16 17:10:41
$35. I'll mail you one if you want to pay in BTC. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 04:37:28
But they have also canceled transactions in the past because they say it is "too high risk". Unless they have changed that, it's not super reliable. It's an amazing service when prices are stable.

Not terrible. I think it's worth it for the fun of putting something together. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:31:42
So could anyone with the capital though. And they might do that, which is exactly what is happening now anyways. Those who have money to buy expensive rigs are able to make money. Gone are the days of mining bitcoins at home. 
@_date: 2013-07-24 19:20:37
Well, the city that they are in is bankrupt, and you *will* be a victim of crime while living there.

Instant transfer is amazing once you get authenticated. To test it out, I went to a restaurant today and placed my order. I got out my phone, bought .5 BTC, it hit my wallet instantly, and then I bought a gift card with Gyft. So I paid for my meal using Bitcoins that I started the order on when I ordered my food. Also I had the giftcard before the food even got there. Amazing. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:52:54
I only had a little bit in blockchain.info, but with the rest of it I have paper wallets and then I keep a small amount in Coinbase because their app is pretty good.

I'm not suggesting total anarchy. I believe we can have a society with complete individual freedom, but if you violate the rights and freedoms of another person you are punished.

If not the largest holder of bitcoin. I think it would be interesting if someone found a backup of his wallet before the government transfers the funds to other addresses. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 18:11:42
Of course. I was just saying it's not likely they would generate coins. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 16:41:07
The transaction fee goes to miners who are confirming transactions. So the money leaves your possession, but goes to someone else in the bitcoin network. The money never leaves. 
@_date: 2013-07-28 03:08:13
If you are looking to buy Modafinil, I can vouch for Rex (on littlebiggy) and MedsForBitcoin. Sucks that BTCnootropics went bad. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:26:45
I have that much too. I was dumb and went from BTC to USD and back pretty quickly. Now I have like 0.0098BTC, and it's not enough to even get it out of the exchange. Combine that with the  0.0002712 BTC, and I have like.. less than 50 cents. 
@_date: 2013-08-17 15:22:23
Nope, that isn't it. There may be a good number of transactions, but I guarantee it's not a significant part of the volume spike. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 03:11:50
CVS. The directions on the slip are easy enough. It is technically a bill, and that's how you pay it.
