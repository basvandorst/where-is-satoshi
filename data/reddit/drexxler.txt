Why on earth would someone buy one of these usernames?

That's awesome! It'll be crazy telling people how you were able to buy a car for $60! I was going to buy my first bitcoin the other week when they were at $200.. then I logged on today and realized how high they've gotten so quick, I figured it was now or never.

For some odd reason OSX likes to pretend it can correct my spelling without telling me.. I've never typed it with spaces before haha.

Hmmm... Maybe I'll write up my own site that integrates with it..
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:18:40
Yes I do.

I'm not. I just happened to load the charts and I saw it drop over $100 in 30 seconds. People were selling volume from 100-200 bitcoins. It just made me feel a little panicky.

Why not just offer to sell the username to CoinValidator then, I just see no need for a public thread.

Regardless whether he was kidding or not, it's not like it would be a dumb thing to do (if I could live without a car for a month or two). I could sell my car for around 5-8k, which in about a month or two could very well be 7-15k. I'd basically get a free upgrade lol
And if the bitcoin market takes a dump, I'd just cash out real quick and live without a car for a bit. I'd be doing the environment a favor.

That's bitchin man.

I agree it's definitely going to go back up. I just was posting here to figure out what exactly would cause it to crash THAT FAST. I'm talking $100 in less than a minute. It was just surprising, that's all.

I'm in for the long term, I already accept my money invested as lost. I'm just hoping that in a year or two it'll be a nice pile of free money :)

No need to down vote so much... I was simply asking a question..

You can, but it's not obvious enough. General &gt; keyboard &gt; shortcuts. Add bitcoin in both fields, done.

If I lived in an inner city, I probably would. Living in the suburbs, it would be impossible to get around without a car.
