I don’t know if this statement is true, but if tether was willing to fudge numbers a little, there is no reason to believe they wouldn’t fudge them a lot.

It’s funny, I had a friend who made this exact same product when btc went to 1000 $ usd. At the time, he was all about it, then one day, he said he didn’t believe in btc anymore and dropped the project.

After the halfing about 6k usd would be Chinese miner break even point and they make up 66% of miners. They could drive out the rest of the mines with a little patiences.

Is this because the bakkt lady got a new job in government?

What I mean, is that the people with the new bitcoins won’t sell them for less than it costs of mine them.

Is it like a puzzle I could solve and win the btc or is it more of an example of what can be done?

It’s both, some is overnight, which increases liquidity, while others are 14 days or more, that is essentially the qe side of things.
To say it’s printing 500 billion is a little dishonest, but it is kind of true at the same time.
I think your concern about the jargon is legitimate, but it could also be a part of the deception. In a way, it’s only a problem if you understand, and as most people don’t / can’t understand it sort of remove some of the problem of it. Markets are really about faith, people can’t loose faith if they don’t understand.

Making it confusing helps because it doesn’t scare people. Basically If people don’t understand, then they have less reason to worry and market is basically build on faith and trust.

In a perfect system, supply cut in half with same demand should cause upwards pressure on price. 
But not system is perfect.

You know, Chinese miners are profitable at 3k usd, after the halfing they will be profitable at 6k usd. So we’ve already reached the moon.
