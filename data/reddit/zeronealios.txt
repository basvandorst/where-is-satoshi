For all the people saying convert to coins and withdraw...YOU CANT! Kraken put limits on the amounts you can withdraw coin wise. So once they scam you in you can only withdraw $5,000.00 worth of crypto daily. Up to $50,000.00 monthly. If it even works and your like me, and you sold it in 2017, trying to get it out in 2018. You get to be taxed TWICE! Yay. Avoid like the plague.

Does anyone have the legal business information for these scumbags? Its getting close to a month and they wont release any of my funds.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:21:24
I have asked support for their legal business name, address, and EIN multiple times, they are dodging the question and not answering. Fraud. Stay away.
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:09:02
If anyone has the actual address we can take action on that would be awesome. But this post is to keep people away from them.

That is the plan. I still wanted an open discussion about this.

You guys are really sweating over this thread.

An intuition that sets limits that low on the amount of money that you can withdraw is most certainly INSOLVENT. They cannot afford to pay everyone at once...so they don't.
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:59:14
Are you not going to give this information out either? Is it because kraken is not an actual exchange? Not only is it not licensed but its not really an exchange?
When people have been "trading" thinking they are exchanging bitcoin with USD have you really been holding the bitcoin in reserves and banking on it to keep going up? Then paying out people little bits of USD at a time as the price was rising and keeping the difference.
A few months ago when people started selling like crazy, did your ponzi scheme fail? Were you not able to handle the amounts USD requests especially as the price plummeted. Sounds like an insolvency scenario to me.

1. No. I will not send you another support ticket. Its not going to happen. All of this information is going to be made public.
2. A FATCA question. YES. It most certainly is. And without Kraken telling people where their money is being held how can they know if they need to file one or not. Your openly stating Kraken will not answer what country clients money is being held? Are you people fucking retarded? At what point did you think it was a good idea to practically say, "Yeah we are hiding this information from you"
3. I'm going to assume you just admitted that the cryptos are not sold. They are held. And this was a ponzi scheme. You are cutting people checks in increments that you can afford. There is no USD account with my name on it. Kraken has stopped the verification process so clients cryptos are locked in an account that can only be withdrawn $50,000 a month. And they are not allowed to withdraw USD.
          
*These are the first hashtags of my life. Kraken...You should be proud. In the unlikely event that you are a legitimate company. How foolish of you people not provide this information to your clients.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:07:48
Well that is not exactly the same. I understand what you are getting at with day traders wanting to make more money by compounding, then getting taxed and making it harder for them to do that. However, they have the ability to withdraw. I do not. I also have no proof that the money...is money.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:15:02
Yeah they need to be removed from the US. With all the trivial stuff going on with Crpyto and laws...we really don't need a company like this making the waters muddy. I also enjoy seeing fraudsters eat it... like FXCM.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:34:03
It's probably not advisable to steal peoples money. It's funny how you comment on this but don't fix any issues.
Additional note: If anyone is thinking of using them valuable information can be found here.

I have plenty of support tickets.
For any readers seeing this quick response time. It is because they have scripts running to check if someone is posting about the company. This looks bad so they got a PR guy to try and save face.
You will never get responses. And when you do get a response it will be some auto generated nonsense. Just look at my previous posts. Look at what other people are saying as well.  I even have posts directly on the Kraken support thread that were never answered.

I will be getting a tax attorney Monday. I don't see how it is a taxable event. If I were to sell a house and someone wrote me a check for said house and then the check bounces... how is that a taxable event? The house was sold but no money was transacted.
 
Or better yet I sell a house and the person on the buying side of the transaction sais, "No you can't have your money...in money form." How is this a transaction? The transaction never took place.
But I'm sure the IRS will see it differently. So Ill have a bunch of paperwork for 2017-2018.

What bank is the US currency held in? Is it a foreign bank? Will your US customers also need to file the necessary paperwork for having a foreign bank account? Also, provide proof of banking with this bank.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:27:28
Is it? What failed exchanges? I have never dealt with a failed bank or exchange. I'm simply going off of property.

So you sell a car to me and I cut you a check for 2,000 dollars. You goto the bank and try and cash it. Nope. Can't. It was a fake check. Did that transaction take place? Do you pay taxes?

Update: I was correct. Talked with a CPA this week. He informed me of something called "Constructive receipt"
"Income although not actually reduced to a taxpayer's possession is constructively received by him in the taxable year during which it is credited to his account, set apart for him, or otherwise made available so that he may draw upon it at any time, or so that he could have drawn upon it during the taxable year if notice of intention to withdraw had been given. However, income is not constructively received if the taxpayer's control of its receipt is subject to substantial limitations or restrictions"
If you have fallen for Krakens scam talk to a CPA.

If I were to evaluate for risk and reward. It favors heavily on just paying the long term tax for 2017 and take all the little losses and fees for 2018.
