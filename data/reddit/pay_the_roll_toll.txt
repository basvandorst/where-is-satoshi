No, I really haven't.  Every landlord has required checks (or money orders).  The assumption being that they don't want to deal with that much cash on hand.
I suppose if you *pressed* the issue, they're probably legally required to allow cash.
How do you pay your utilities?  Send cash through the mail?  I wouldn't even know where to go to pay my utility bill other than their website.

How does this work?  You walk to their house and give them cash...or?
Do you have an actual lease?  I've never even heard of a landlord that accepts cash.

How do you pay your rent/mortgage with cash?

Tread lightly.  I just signed up for this (I've decided to start spending a lot of my coins lately), and the credentials it gave me to log in don't work.
I don't super care, because I wasn't going to use this anyway, but that's really annoying.
This is why chargebacks exist in real life, bros.  I have no way of getting my 0.018 bitcoins or whatever it was back now.
That sucks.
(I'm messaging support right now, but I honestly don't want to spend more than a few more minutes trying to track this down.)
I'd give it time for them to work the kinks (ha!) out before using this (if it's a service you legitimately want)
edit: Support tells me: "I'm sorry, your email address is not found"
edit2: an email came through after about 20-30mins.  If you sign up, give it a LOT of time.  I wonder if they're doing this manually or something?
edit3: I'm in, but it looks like this equivalent to pornhub.com etc.  My username and password don't work on any of their "channel" websites.

How old are you?  You don't have and don't want a bank account...
How do you pay rent?  How do you receive your paycheck?  How do you pay utility bills?

Sortof...  It's more about price stability.  It's nice knowing that the $100 I have on my phone is still going to be about $100 next week.
