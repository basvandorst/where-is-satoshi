Worked. Thanks for the help!

That's a fair point.
More network manipulation.
Can that even be solved? Say you increase the block size to 2mb. That doesn't actually fix the spamming problem. The only thing that would fix the spamming problem would be to have a blocksize large enough to accommodate the extra spam. Except the problem with that is that it would drive the fee down too low to make mining profitable.

And that's the *real* problem a of non-fixed blocksize. It allows the miners to manipulate the market.
If mining gets too concentrated, then the primary miner(s) can simply invest into an alt, then dump the current coin. Everyone thinks the miner fees would be the best profit, but imagine if you were able to invest into bitcoin back when it was $0.10/btc and you get the idea. There could very well be more money in dumping btc and switching over to an alt that you're heavily invested into then promoting that.
A fixed blocksize would never face this issue because the size increase would be modeled to match the circulation rate (i.e. match growth of transactions).

They rarely don't go hand in hand.

Which was created back in a period when few had access to buying gold in a meaningful way.
Gold also doesn't have things like hard forks which create gold knockoff that the market has to deal with.

He's not wrong. Believing they'll make it smaller is probably wrong, but believing they'll control the blocksize to maximize profits, isn't wrong.
If you were to increase the blocksize to 10mb right now, then pretty much everyone could get their transaction confirmed within 20 minutes. At that point, they'd cut their fee by over 90%. Remember, time is valued exponentially, not linearly. So if it takes 6 hours, people are going to be willing to pay a lot more than 6x what they would pay if it takes 1 hour. However, there is a cutoff point where people won't care too much between say 10 minutes and 20 minutes if it means paying 2x more to cut it in half (marginal utility of time).
Therefore if they increase the blocksize too much, profitability will begin to drop as the nominal value of time isn't great enough to cover the margin cost of said time, therefore causing people to just pay them minimum for 20 minutes.

Market manipulation happens all the time. The difference is how much it takes to manipulate said market.
Bitcoin had a jump and dump the day of the announcement and it took just 0.005% of the total market cap of Bitcoin to cause a 13% price surge which was used to take money from people with pending futures orders.
That's almost impossible to do with regular asset markets.

I'm not talking about the network spam, I'm talking about periods when the network isn't being spammed (i.e. normal operation).

Ah yes, the EEA, a cabal of multinational corporations that are giving their "support" (i.e. the proverbial high five and pat on the back) but not dropping a single cent into the public chains or tokens.
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:40:00
I have yet to see a single piece of news that said ANY company publicly state they've invested in any tokens or ICO's.
That's what makes me fully believe they're planning on usurping the code later (once it's far enough along for their liking) and implementing their own dapps that run on their own private chains.
It won't be some private chain between all the companies, but rather an individual private chain at each company.
Logically, it's cheaper for them to run private chains rather than use the public chain especially as *most* if not all of those corporations have at least one location with a massive server room if not an entire data center so they therefore already own the hardware to run the middleware (ETH variant).

Fight for freedom would require a true revolution and nobody these days has any willingness for real revolution anymore.

Because if EVERYONE is hoarding bitcoin, then it goes towards infinite and it's just everyone betting against each other. That's a complete zero sum game at that point. A tower of cards waiting to collapse.
The net value means nothing because you can't actually liquidate without the price dropping an insane amount.
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:22:47
Not if your own exchange runs market making.
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:34:30
Because it creates fake volume on the exchanges. Hard to see real buying and selling if it's all just back and forth free trading.

Diamonds exhibited the same properties until synthetic ones were created. Then nobody gave a shit about natural ones anymore because they were insanely overpriced.
Bitcoin doesn't mean shit unless you have a massive amount in a SINGLE address (which most wallets now use clusters of addresses instead to increase security). Very few people have the money to say "look I'm holding a 100 bitcoin in this address just for shits and giggles". You get the same applause if you have that much in your bank account or stock portfolio. Few really care.
I'd say you guys are all overthinking it.

You missed the critical part of US government power grab law:
If you purposely keep your transactions *under* $10k so you stay under the legally required minimum for reporting, you are breaking the law as well. It's called structuring and has the same criminal penalties as not reporting.
Welcome to the crap I've been saying about this stuff since day one and why I never believed cryptos were the future.

No it's not. *Blockchain* is that. But you're not buying ***the*** blockchain with bitcoin you're buying ***a*** blockchain.
Who cares if you can publish a transaction?
BIG deal. I can publish a YouTube video or get on Facebook live and flash stacks of cash (people do that A LOT). It doesn't mean jackshit. For all we know it was your rent money.

100 BTC could tank the price 10% on OKC.
You saw it on the futures especially.
People would drop like 500k of futures and the price would have a flash crash and recovery.

I think what he means is that the cost of transacting is proportional to the value of the network.
If the cost of transaction drops faster than the reward of mining, then the network security ends up decreasing. If it decreases enough, the network can be successfully attacked.

Liquidity != real volume though.
It was just speculation, especially using bots.
Effectively people feeding money into a slot machine.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:13:10
More zero-fee trading.
So less moon and more speculation.
