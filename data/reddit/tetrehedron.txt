Thanks what's the limit on there and is it pretty secure? I read another article of a website that got hacked and lost millions in crypto.

100% agree with you brother. Key thing you brought up was "don't invest more than you can afford to lose, and forget about that money until 5, 10+ years in the future". Too many people threw in more money than they can afford to lose, they took out loans and put things on the line in hope to get rich quick. So when crypto dropped they were forced to sell off. Especially at times like these alot of people lost alot of money, and hope. And are broken. They put in too much in and had super high expectations in such a short time frame. We all did but too many went in too aggressive.

It's both I was gonna include the main reasons why I'm holding but I feel that's for another post was also was gonna discuss key things of crypto and other investments. One of the main reasons for me is fiat inflation is 2% on average which is pretty scary if you put in the numbers and how wages dont keep up with it.

I found a bitcoin at in my area  I put in 20$ and got $12 worth of bitcoin. That's  %40 fees it didn't even say anywhere in the machine. I'd rather take 1-2% fees from exchanges any day.

Cause of the China thing right. Should I wait a couple days or weeks? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:52:51
Thanks I will keep an eye out.

True, although can it be possible if FIAT money fails and we are left using crypto currency say 100 years from now. Bitcoin being one of the main ones. I guess I'm on the hype train it's possible it can have unimaginable growth.
 If you went back in time and told people that bitcoin worth 0.06$ not even on par with the dollar, would in less than 10 years reach 5,000$ per unit. People would of laughed at you.

On the website I posted? Which website do you think has a fair deal
@_date: 2017-09-09 06:51:41
I'm looking to invest in bitcoin for the long term. It's truly a phenomenon I can't wait to see where it will go. I'm also looking on investing on blue chips. And also doing research  on Penny stocks for short term. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:56:02
That sounds like a good investment strategy. Thanks for sharing. Hopefully one day it will reach 1 million dollars for 1 bit coin. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:52:20
Thanks man that's pretty deep. It hits to close to home. Are you me from the future...
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:58:14
True I'll focus on percentages, I just checked for 200$ it's 0.04 of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-09 06:46:28
Thanks for the advice. I'm planning in investing in bitcoin long term. And penny stocks short term wish me luck.

No they are stocks worth less than 5 dollars. Investing in these stocks for long term and hoping for one to be the next Facebook is financial suicide. They are highly volatile and the plan is to catch the stock when you think it's as low as you think it will go and after a huge drop there will be a bounce. Sometimes there is no bounce and stock can possibly die. If begins to drop past you limit, just cut your loses and pull out. You don't wanna be running on hope.
If a stock is worth 0.2$ and goes up to 0.5 you sell them. Obviously you are not gonna get rich investing one stock at a time. So you gotta buy a ton of these stocks say 500$ or 1,000$ worth. You usually wanna bet 20-50 of your investing money. 50% is pretty bold but if you want maximum growth and you are confident, then go for it. 
I've been studying penny stocks for 5 days and I'm still not confident enough to go in and start. I suggest do practice runs. Do research a company see how they are performing and the pretend you invested 1000$ when the stock is at .40. And treat it as if you was real money and write when you pull out and stuff. Have a game plan before hand. Ima do 100 test runs of these before I get started I suggest you do the same if you are interested.

I'm never using a crypto atm anymore. The one I used was a 40% fees I'm not kidding I put in 20$ got $12 dollars worth of bitcoin. The fees are ridiculous. No where on it did it say the fee %. No wonder people stay away from these.

I was an ATH buyer got more into crypto and learned a lot. I'm not selling. Even if this year is a disappointment I still see a lot of potential. It might take my investments to pay off in 3, 4 or even 5 years down the line and that's fine with me.
