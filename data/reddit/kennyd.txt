You have 'experts' and you have experts.
I am the latter. Good day sir.

**1 - THIS IS JUST GENERAL MARKET CYCLES. BITCOIN RISES, THEN IT GOES DOWN. RIGHT NOW IT'S GOING DOWN. IF YOU LOOK AT THE SMALLER TIMEFRAME LIKE WEEKS OR MONTHS YOU DONT NOTICE THE TREND, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT YEARS THE TREND BECOMES OBVIOUS. BITCOIN ENTERS AN ACCUMULATION PHASE, A BUILD UP PHASE, A BUBBLE PHASE, AND THEN A BEAR MARKET PHASE. ACCUMULATION IS A PERIOD OF TIME, OFTEN MORE THAN 6 MONTHS, WHERE BITCOIN DOES NOT MOVE MUCH. THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE ACCUMULATE BITCOINS. THEN IT BEGINS IT'S BUILD UP PHASE WHERE IT WORKS ITS WAY BACK UP TO THE ALL TIME HIGH. THEN IT ENTERS ITS BUBBLE PHASE WHERE WE SEE AN UNSUSTAINABLE RISE TO A NEW ALL-TIME HIGH, BEFORE ABRUPTLY ENTERING IT'S CRASH PHASE, WHERE THE PRICE CRASHES FROM IT'S ALL TIME HIGH TO A PRICE MORE THAN 80% LOWER. RIGHT NOW, WE ARE BETWEEN THE CRASH PHASE AND THE ACCUMULATION PHASE. WE ARE COMING VERY CLOSE TO THE ACCUMULATION PHASE, PROBABLY WITHIN THE NEXT 3 MONTHS. I DOUBT THE PRICE OF BITCOIN GOES BELOW $2400.**
**2- PEOPLE TRY TO PREDICT THE PRICE, AND THEY ARE OFTEN RIGHT, SO THIS IS DEFINITELY THING. HOWEVER GOING DAY BY DAY THE ACTION CAN BE VERY HARD TO PREDICT. IT IS EASIER TO PREDICT PRICES LONG TERM.**
**3 - BITCOIN'S PRICE WILL PROBABLY REACH $100,000 OR $200,000 - THAT'S 100K OR 200K, BY THE YEAR 2023. IT'S DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AN EXACT PRICE, BUT NEXT YEAR WE WILL SEE AN ACCUMULATION PHASE AND THE FOLLOWING YEARS WE WILL SEE THE BUILD UP AND BUBBLE PHASE.**
**GREAT TO HAVE YOU BE APART OF THIS FINANCIAL REVOLUTION, EVEN THROUGH THE LOWS, ENJOY YOUR CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS!**
