Hey! Sorry for the super late reply! Haven't logged in with this account in a while. We launched now, so give it a shot! And the twitter link is fixed!

Thanks! We can't wait to show everyone.

We'll launch the beta soon and you'll get a chance to try it out! Streamium is p2p, so while there will be a static page to set up the connection, there is no need for servers. The video and payments will flow directly between content provider and client. 
Decentralization is amazing. :)

The error you are seeing is caused by not having properly setuped the peerjs server. Right now it's pointing to a local server, but you can change it to a non-local one by removing these lines: 
Sorry about this, but the project isn't ready yet. It will be soon though!

Without getting into much detail:
1. A content provider will go to streamium.io and set up a stream (name, USD/min rate, bitcoin address to receive payments) and get a url to share the stream with a client (or multiple clients). 
2. The client then loads the URL, commits as much bitcoin as they'd like (which determines the maximum amount of time they can view the stream)
3. As the client views the stream, the provider receives payments every second using a micropayment channel. All this is entirely p2p-- there is no middleman.
4. When either party ends the stream, the micropayment channel is closed and the transaction is pushed to the Bitcoin network. 
EDIT: keep in mind this is will be a beta and a proof of concept. It's a first step. We can see this technology being used for some pretty amazing things. That's why its open-source :)

Hi! Thanks! Streamium started in November when some friends got together for a Bitcoin hackathon. It's unrelated to Bitpay or any other company. 
We're aiming to launch the beta in February! We set up a landing page at Streamium.io with the February target.

Hopefully, sooner! :)

No, I was referring to the license that governs the use of the code: 
We're all from Buenos Aires, Argentina, but coincidentally one of use did actually go to MIT (but this has nothing to do with the use of the MIT license.) 
The rest of the team went to ITBA, an excellent technical university which is like the MIT of Argentina! (
EDIT: typo

The future is bright! But, FYI, you won't need to install or run anything for Streamium! It runs in your browser and all communication (video and payment streaming) is conducted directly between the content provider and the client. No need for nodes :)

Getting paid with a micropayment channel while you poop.... isn't that more of a project for buttcoiners? :P
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:19:44
Is there anything else? :)
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:25:58
Right off the bat, you'll be able to set up streams on streamium.io (and then post the links wherever else you'd like)-- no need to install or program anything. Keep in mind that this is free-- streamium is not a middleman.
Right now we're focused on finishing a working product that is both useful and shows the world what's possible... but rest assured, we already have plans for what's next!
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:22:40
Absolutely! In fact, that's what we're counting on! We're excited about the technology and wanted to build something to show the world what's possible. This is merely a first step!
