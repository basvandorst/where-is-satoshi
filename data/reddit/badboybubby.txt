I think bitcoin is about to go on an epic pump, the media outlook and the financial institutions have just changed tone about bitcoin and I think there about to plow in big style over the next few months or more.  I am not nervous at all but I have been hodling for 18 months  :-)

I think the 'Thank You' should very much be from us to you sir.

I just started my own node two days ago just waiting for it to catch up to the current block.  Its a raspberry pi 2 so could take a while :-)
I followed this guide 
It says pi3 but my 2 is running fine at the moment.

Can't argue with such in depth analysis

I'm waiting for a moon 10x this size but congrats if this is your moon.

I am just waiting on the arrival of my ledger and then I will be removing my coins from blockchain.info because of there stance on 2x.   NO2X

You receive the exact same for all bitcoin you hold part or full coins

Whilst the fee's are currently low on BCH and probably will be on 2x when it forks over time if they were to become popular and there number of transactions rise then they will only hit the same bottle neck Bitcoin currently has and there fee's would start to rise also.  
Another bad point for these two alts is that over time because of there scaling choice they would start to become centralized also, because fewer people would be able to run nodes because of the cost of storage space, bandwidth and processing power, whilst this may not be a major problem in developed countries in poorer countries there will much less nodes running and since one of the core values of bitcoin is to help get poorer countries banked, keeping the entry level as low as possible is key.

The general sentiment in this post is correct we need to hassle and keep bashing these groups to fully implement segwit,

I don't think an ssd is the answer its processing power that is needed to process the transactions faster, your node has to process every transaction ever done on the bitcoin network.  Chill it will get there my raspberry pi node took around 10 weeks :-) but is now up and running.

I feel it may be a touch centralized around the Universa Corporation.  with trusted approved third parties.  It sounds as promising as an Jamie Dimon coin to me.

I have just this minute put my order in for a nano s, so I can get my coins off blockchain.info before the fork,  I don't like there stance for the upcoming 2x fork.  NO2X.  I should have done this months ago to be honest.
