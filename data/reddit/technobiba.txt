And essentially,

given operational costs were almost non-existent, you conclude what?

Yes, this is true, but they could be thinking: "Kill it before it lays eggs" :)

This is actually a great idea. Give your loved ones 0.2 BTC each *on top* of the usual presents you ment to give.
This way, the money is going to stay in the family (and bitcoin will hopefully grow).

I have an urgent message for you, Ross!
Use liquid soap, you greedy fuck.
@_date: 2013-09-28 09:15:45
As I have said, q=2/3 seems good. It would still benefit early adopters, but not so so unfairly.
@_date: 2013-10-29 18:00:18
Well, possibly. But it's still risky.
@_date: 2013-10-08 19:18:01
The bets being visible is the least of my concern here, but you are thinking in the same way I do. See my comment.
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:59:27
Hey, It's an experimental post. I've seen its score ranging from +20 to -10.
Moreover, I've written that because of lack of design (it looks too plastic to me), not because of it's geeky features, com' on! :)
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:58:28
I don't get your logic. Why do you have to restock at precise time of purchase?
Buy anytime you want, before, after, whenever you have time and money.
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:15:01
This is wishful thinking, sorry. We agree that early adopters weren't stupid, therefore they used multiple wallets (either multiple small ones, either one big, one small). They have spent only the small ones, keeping the big intact for later.
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:14:00
Ross,

You are more likely to win the lottery, several times in a row.
You can then convert winnings into bitcoin :)

Yes, you can roll out a new currency without benefiting early adopters unfairly. See my post.

Downvote. Gold doesn't have a default unit, therefore nothing is to be matched.
@_date: 2013-10-08 19:00:49
This game is prone to inside manipulations. Since the punishment for betting late in the game is only a fee to you, anyone endorsed by you is able to bet freely.
Hint: the payout should be dependent on the betting time, not your "rake". That means one bitcoin put in 5 hours early counts as 1,2 bitcoin put 2 hours before the end.
*In short*: 1. Coins put in earlier should account for more. 2. Players betting late are doing so at the expense of other players, so they should benefit, not you.
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:18:40
I just wanted to do so 2 days ago. There was this guitar tuner for 3€. I had to go trough painful credit card registration, which didn't work at the end.
There is a place for a middle party who'd buy applications for you with fiat, given bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 16:56:09
Yep, exactly. I'm paying around 12€ for a non-managed one.
But if you want to compare the prices of normal hosting and a VPS, you have to take managing into the account / price.
@_date: 2013-11-02 09:02:15
I don't know if I agree. So, you're saying the displayed amount is final? What if user inserts more money? What if he waits an additional minute and exchange rates drop or rise drastically?
I don't see a point how this early precalculation could help at all. I think bitcoin is mature enough for users to just think: I want a $100 equivalent in bitcoin, since that was their intent. This step is redundant.
Moreover, since the cash limit is $3000, there won't, in practice, be any drastic exchange rate fluctuations as the consequence of the buy.
@_date: 2013-09-28 20:57:28
I'm not implying Satoshi could have done better in terms of giving everybody equal chance.
You could have, by not saying everybody had the same chance to be an early adopter. That is simply not true. Got it?

Continually, but selectively.

Trezor: How the f* do they know 0,4M bitcoin were lost?
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:15:30
Are you stupid or what? I said: do restock, but it can be tommorrow or yesterday, not precisely now.
@_date: 2013-10-03 10:11:55
With government resources, this is pretty doable.
1. Use some advanced OCR
2. Employ 3-5 guys to do the same task (duplicate work), then check for inconsistencies between their work. In worst case, you can brute-force the illegible/dubious data.
@_date: 2013-10-27 12:02:46
Small countries are biased, there might be few reasons. For Slovenia, I'd say, since Bitstamp was operating here, a huge amount of downloads represent their internal needs.

They don't even support EUR, are you that optimistic?
@_date: 2013-10-05 18:38:22
How much time did you spend making this application?
Why are page generation times so big (in range 1/10 to 1/5 of a second). That is not going to sustain significant load.

I'd rather bury myself 10 feet under ground than wear this shit.
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:55:05
I have raised the number a little. However, you are overestimating in my opinion. Bitcoin has still a lot to go, which is, in fact, a good news.
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:58:54
Please, stop using Windows. Some might say it's inferior in terms of security design, but that is debatable, however, in my opinion true.
But what is for sure - a much much bigger percentage of windows computers are compromised than linux, mac or in fact, any other OS.

More than bitching, I want you to view my post as an idea for discussion.
@_date: 2013-09-28 12:31:11
I suggest you look into philosophy of fairness, equity &amp; justice. I assure you, not everyone had "the ability to become aware of bitcoin just as early as anyone else.", there are simply too many factors involved.
@_date: 2013-10-26 09:50:22
Original difficulty was 0. That means infinite increase per day. Unless you want to convince me otherwise?
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:57:45
300! is a pretty large number.
@_date: 2013-10-27 17:05:45
I agree with you too, pal. There is also another problem. Some people don't have enough money for a whole coin or they don't want to invest so much, so they keep out, thinking they have no chance.
We should emphasize divisibility more.
@_date: 2013-11-01 21:17:30
To point out the obvious, there is an unnecessary step of amount selection, since that is completely determined by your fifth step.
I know the reasoning behind is to get ahold of the exchange rate, but that could be done in a simpler way (or not at all, or by simply writing the exchange rate in the corner).
Moreover, there should be also *an option* "hand me a free informational leaflet", with bitcoin simply explained for new people and to prevent stalls.
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:46:33
It's a bad commercial. Focusing on wrong aspects of bitcoin, such as tax evasion, etc...
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:47:21

@_date: 2013-11-07 11:57:54
Which part of "or yesterday" don't you understand? If the price dropped, the situation would be just reversed. You can't know.
Moreover, you don't have to restock at precise moments in small increments. Let's say you've done 10 transactions at 0.1 BTC over the course of a day. It's fine if you restock 1 BTC at once around this time.
My point: Creating software for this is pointless. Why do I even bother with you, since you're clearly inferior?
@_date: 2013-10-16 06:08:20
The problem with those people is just their insecurity. O'shit, it has dropped 10%, sell, sell, sell, quick!
@_date: 2013-09-28 09:13:50


Well, that is highly debatable. Let's not get into that. That is also not the point of my point. I'm an altruist so I consider other people a lot.
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:41:04
Yeah, just do that and bitcoin is a dead-man.
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:12:06
What the fuck is that title supposed to mean?
@_date: 2013-10-26 09:40:08
3.86%, actually. Get your maths straight.
@_date: 2013-11-01 14:05:00
Definitely better, but more like:
1. Wallet selection
a) Create new wallet
b) Use existing one
2. Cash deposit (deposit the cash and tap DONE)
3. Palm scan
And on the printed walled, you should write: "This is your bitcoin wallet. Do NOT lose it."

After playing this game for a whole day, I have finally uncovered their hidden address. This has brought me 5BTC, which is not a small amount. :) I'd like to say that they were completely fair regarding everything, and this is also the reason I'm posting this here.

10 is perfectly valid in base ten. It is not like saying 5 in base 5. If he wanted to make a joke, he should phrase it like this:

Yes, let's cheat a bunch of people and then make justice only to those, who complain.
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:54:41
Currently, there are about 2 million nonempty bitcoin addresses, from which I estimate 600K people (because almost everyone owns multiple addresses).
Thus, the current average is around 20 BTC. Don't be pissed about this, we have a lot of really rich fucks, who hold large amounts (not mentioning the US government) and cause bias.
For example, in our country, the average salary is unexpectedly high for the same reason. Therefore, the *median* is the statistic you should be asking about, not the mean. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 19:23:31
Sorry, guys. I have watched the video, but the interface is an UX (user experience) failure. Moreover, it looks like 80's cash machine. Work on it!

Obviously a made-up story. But it gets the point across. I agree.
@_date: 2013-10-26 19:33:20
Which part do you need more explanation on? You cannot compare raw meat to a prepared steak at the best restaurant.
In your post, you asserted people needn't anymore to pay for crappy shared hostings, they should just take VPS every time.

@_date: 2013-11-07 10:20:17
Moreover, even pointing out the right transaction doesn't prove this wasn't a setup.
@_date: 2013-10-27 11:49:12
Well, I still think small countries, like Slovenia or Lithuania are biased. Would anyone dare to guess why?
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:59:08
I estimate the current median to be around 1 BTC, rather a little less. Hopefully it'll drop over time, which means more equal wealth distribution.
@_date: 2013-10-19 15:23:14
No way.
@_date: 2013-11-01 12:34:10
As an UX (user experience) proffessional, I can tell that the whole interface and the process is really bad / tedious. Moreover, design looks like it has been made by bad designer, who time-traveled from the 90's.
I'm bashing because I wish the best for you. Please work on the things I have pointed out. Simplicity is the thing that attracts people. Please upvote.

@_date: 2013-11-02 09:15:57
Yeah, this is no brainer, I'd like that too. But it's not going to happen soon. But that doesn't mean bitcoin doesn't solve anything. Listen...
Since the current billionaires have a lot of fiat, they could afford to buy a lot of btc. This is inevitable.
But eventually, after few decades, the wealth will redistribute more evenly. Since the rich will be purchasing real goods and services from ordinary people, they will have to eventually earn the money in a way that the same ordinary people will see as beneficial to them. Not by fictitious banking, money printing - the stuff ordinary citizens have no control over and is currently happening.
*Point: We cannot eliminate inequality, but we are better off with bitcoin.*

It doesn't matter if they start moving or not (they could as well be moving between addresses owned by the same person). But if they are put on sale (increasing supply), then, yes.
@_date: 2013-10-26 09:22:16
50 BTC is a pretty nice amount! Do you still have them or are they lost?
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:12:37
It is. If you want to run bitcoind service on your server, for enabling purchases and don't want to use Coinbase or similar service. Next time, think!
@_date: 2013-10-26 20:59:54
I won't even try to explain again.
VPS and shared hostings are two completely different types of service. They might overlap for a small % of the people (ones with enough technical knowledge), but this is rather an exception.
To everyone their own.
@_date: 2013-10-09 04:32:24
Then % sign should be written explicitly or in a decimal form 25% -&gt; 0.25

Wow. That's a huge fee.

Thanks, I have been researching the blockchain for quite some time now. However, this site is quite good, check it out (both links):  
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:47:06
The reason they do that is to relay all the risk to you. That's a huge cheat.
You buy bitcoins for X$. They buy them immediately, since they have your money.
After one week, if bitcoins are worth less, they grant you your order. If they are worth more, they sell them and pocket the difference.
It's this simple. Coinbase is a disgrace to the community.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:59:46
No, because then you cannot run bitcoin client and local server at the same time.
@_date: 2013-10-26 14:17:05
Nope, A is digit "10" in bases n&gt;10, not 11, as you have said.
1 0 (one, zero) in base 10 in just 10. And nope, difficulty is not 10.
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:11:47
Lol. You can't say that, it's all about the denomination. It's like saying oil is worth much more than gold. You have to be more specific.
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:25:50
As far as I know, there is nothing in the bitcoin protocol that allows arbitrary commenting on the transactions.
This is purely a feature of some website, which could be a goner tomorrow and FBI doesn't care about at all.
Don't get too excited.

@_date: 2013-10-30 16:04:12
Well, not being a native speaker, I have first looked up the phrase "on the cusp", which apparently means "at the beginning". So, the poster thinks the bubble is forming, *despite* all the facts he presented.
@_date: 2013-10-06 09:44:21
This is a quite good way to think about this. When bitcoin was $15, I was saying I was going to buy it when it hits $5.
But it just kept rising, and before I trully realised, it had been around $160 and there I had foolishly stepped in.
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:19:51

@_date: 2013-09-28 09:22:00
If you are speaking about bitcoin stabilisng to some X value of let's say dollars, that shouldn't happen, as dollars are inflating over time.
Even if bitcoin keeps the same value, it should grow in relation to dollar.
