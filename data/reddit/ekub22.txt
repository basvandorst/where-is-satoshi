Thats very unkind of you. I don't have any holdings in any cryptocurrency currently. I was interested in sia coin because i was planing to use their cloud hosting service. I used to hold Monero, sold it when it reached 140$. Why you are so mean?

Bitcoin distribution is very unequal anyways. Thats why it is not the future of finance. Blockchain technology is very promising but Bitcoin is not. The founder(s) of Bitcoin has ~1.500.000 BTC and never spent them. There is only 5.000.000 BTC left to be mined and it will take ~120 years to mine the remaining coins. Think about this, 16.000.000 BTC has been mined within the first 8 years, and the remaining 5.000.000 is going to take 120 years to mine. I don't know why no one is talking about this ridiculous situation. Blockchain technology has very bright future but to my opinion BTC is obsolete and no one should own one. Distribution is terrible. Investing in BTC is literally gambling with your money. I am not saying you wont profit from it, people made shit ton of money from it. But it is just like a pyramid scheme, early adopters become rich, and newcomers has to find more people to sell BTC to increase its price and thus, profit. Please don't hate me for expressing my opinion, any counter argument is welcome.

This is like going to Vegas, go all in and then brag about how great of a decision you made.
