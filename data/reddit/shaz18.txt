Who's the smarter one if he dumped his btc at $16-20k USD in 2017/18? Him or HODLers that rode out the last bull run but never sold?

Investing is always worth it if you can afford to lose the money if things go wrong.
One thing many investors regret in life is why they didn't start investing earlier :)

Minor service outage. Btc back up to 15.3k.
And btw, $400-500 at 15.5k isn't a major drop :D

Maybe she was busy or something and thought OP said eleven hundred? ��‍♂️

Came here to say this. It's a personal question which I would not like to answer and this is the most neutral and situationally funny answer you can give without sounding like an asshole.

btcmarkets is good :)

That was because of Mt Gox.

+1 for Trezor and its completely open source so I'm more comfortable with it

Why does BTC trade at a premium in Aus :/
$9k AUD = $6.9K USD.
I understand that it will also sell for a premium but when I buy BTC to purchase goods and not to hodl, it does become more costly than it has to.

If I knew the answer to that I would be swing trading every fluctuation and making millions haha. No one knows buddy, just hold on tight and have a plan for when you want to sell and get some profit. Don't get too greedy and sit through the peak and the crash that usually follows in hope that it will bounce back. You can do something like selling 5% at price X, then 10% at price Y etc.

Relax. It's going back up. Coinbase/Gdax seems to be having some issues and people are shitting themselves.
This was an exceptional opportunity to buy the dip.

Please do not store your crypto on an exchange, it is not your crypto if you choose to do so. If the exchange gets hacked tomorrow or goes bankrupt you can kiss all your money goodbye. Hardware wallets are a cold storage option of storing your cryptocurrency on an encrypted USB device in which YOU have complete ownership of your coins. The Trezor or Ledger devices are encrypted devices which stores your crypto and private keys OFFLINE and also signs transactions. The hardware wallet protects your cryptocurrency from being stolen for example if you have an infected device the hacker cannot access your cryptocurrency because the Trezor/Ledger protect it. I use a trezor and strongly suggest getting one if you have half a bitcoin.

People with $10 USD can't buy Apple products either but that doesn't stop Apple from being successful.

Btcmarkets is good in my experience
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:15:33
It's only down 1.6k actually which is 13%. This is normal fluctuation in crypto so please ignore the FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) spreading troll.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:08:34
10,300 in 3 hours from now.

Sell on Btcmarkets. You send the bitcoins to your wallet on there and then sell them to other traders on the exchange. You will receive AUD in your exchange account when your bitcoins sell, which you are then able to withdraw to your bank account.

Bitcoin is still in its growth stage as a technology. We are early adopters.
Just because Bitcoin is a high valued unit, does not mean you need $6500 to own Bitcoin or a portion of. People with $400 can also be involved.
