Hey, thanks for the input! 
What would you say to [this comment]( abount Bitcoin.de's fees being too expensive or at least more expensive than the others?

Thank you very much for your answer.
It is still not very clear to me, still, where is that $310.92 value coming from, since my coins have just been doubled without any real value aggregated to them.
I also editted my reply to your first comment. Mind explaining that too, please?
Again, thank you very much for your help and apologies if I may be asking too basic questions.

Do you mean that GDAX fees are lower than Coinbase's or is there something else that I need to know?
Also, should I worry about North-american coin traders being myself in Europe?
Thanks in advance! :)

I might have skipped some economy lectures, but are you saying that these investments are going to be doubled or what?
Sorry for being so naive. I'm really new into this whole thing.
If yes (which I doubt), where is the value coming from? I can't just copy+paste my money and double its value, as far as I know.
Edit: in your analogy, which would be the "businesses" (from me and from my friend) when it comes to Bitcoins? I thought BitCoins didn't have any administration or company behind them.
