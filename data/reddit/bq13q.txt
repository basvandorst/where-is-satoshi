Zuckerberg and Gates of course were born rich, just not billionaires in their own right.
But your point stands.

Is there a better way to find btc-accepting merchants in .ar than  Because right now it appears that there are fewer merchants in all of Argentina than in San Francisco where the fiat is much more stable.

Two hotels, one restaurant, and 11 non-retail listings in all of BA. Coinmap has 101 listings.
It wouldn't take much for Bitcoin to be twice as big as it is in BA now, but it would still be a pretty niche novelty AFAICT. What's going to change to motivate regular porteños to make their first purchase with btc?

I was there last month and came across no businesses that accepted bitcoin and met only person who'd even heard of bitcoin. It's true, I could have gotten a Subway sandwich, but overall I was very let down by all the .ar btc hype. As you can see from coinbase, it's pretty much all specialty services, not retail or dining or anything you might need or want in the ordinary course of daily life. As a tourist, you might be able to pay for lodging in btc but other than that the pickings are slim.

When I was visiting .ar, I wanted to buy stuff, and nobody I met wanted anything to do with Bitcoin. Probably less than half of them would take USD. I think it would be a great help for the popularity of Bitcoin if it could be easily converted to local currency. Even in the face of Argentinean inflation, it really doesn't matter if you only buy a few days of pesos at a time.

Does it allow buying pesos for bitcoin as well?
