Nothing. Unless you think banks will use Bitcoin for that, in which case it competes with Bitcoin, which they won't, so it doesn't.
@_date: 2015-06-10 06:54:16
They can't. Which is why they'd use a private ledger.

XRP is Ripple
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:20:22
It's not. 1m is less precise than 100cm. 1.00m is as precise as 100cm.

I assume that wasn't the hacker himself and actually someone who purchased it from him? Hence the apparently.
@_date: 2014-11-02 13:11:23
That's what "of" means. Of implies membership, in implies number of people between you and the next person like you.
@_date: 2014-11-01 16:43:05
Can you spell it out for me, because I still don't see the point.
@_date: 2014-11-01 15:39:09
There isn't one. Your question doesn't make sense.

Please find a way to donate to the people and not Hamas.
@_date: 2014-11-02 06:15:01
That's actually the opposite of what that means, though. One in a million means for person like you, there are 999,999 normal people. So you want to be one in a billion = 999,999,999 normal people. One *of* a million makes more sense.
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:08:36
You are weird.
@_date: 2014-04-10 09:27:28
No, the cost is fine (which is why I chose it), I meant writing "0.0008 BTC" is ridiculous. Writing 0.8m฿ is also fine, but he seemed to be arguing that two digits of precision of ฿ is fine, a fidelity of 3 quid. I give up!
@_date: 2014-09-26 09:46:08
 Does some great pieces, like the Chine Bitcoin mine one from a while back.
@_date: 2014-04-09 23:51:50


Because 3.46 is still $4.50 more. You'd need two more decimals to be practical.

4. Roger digitally signed v7 but only scan signed v8, knowing he could prove he signed v7 but no one could prove v8. Not that I think this is likely at all, but still a possibility.
@_date: 2014-04-10 01:11:13
Oh, perhaps I misunderstood what you meant. Do you mean BTC is fine for transactions above ~$1500 and you'd use something else for smaller purchases?


I don't understand this point at all. 0.0008 BTC for a pack of gum is ridiculous and it will only get worse as BTC appreciates.
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:31:04
Yeah... OP sets up a dumb strawman then knocks it down... nice. If all centralised exchanges used the same network it'd make sense.
@_date: 2015-05-25 21:56:52
Agree, makes more sense just to not sign v8 at all, unless this was all an elaborate ruse to make Star look like a fraud. Really doesn't appear to be the case but is at least a possibility.
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:33:27
I have treble figures of bitcoin, I'm not a buttcoiner. But a VC sending a well funded company $70 is dumb. Like people giving Bill Gates Reddit gold.

What did the parent comment say?
@_date: 2015-05-24 07:28:23
The Fedwire for dollars for primary banks. ACH for smaller. Correspondent banking for international client banks. That's just USD. And CLS for international inter-bank currency settlement. And the DTCC for derivatives. And... for securities... bonds... loans... That's why.
@_date: 2015-05-25 22:11:41
I don't think he signed 1-7, only 7. I assume 1-6 were drafts and not signed. Resigning and replacing a contract 7 time would be very unusual.
@_date: 2015-05-24 04:22:56
Like E-ZPass.
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:24:21
This is a terrible reason to love bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-10 05:44:26
The first part of what you said is nonsense. 1.2 km is as precise as 1.2 cm? The unit very much matters in precision.
The second half of what you are saying contradicts the first.
@_date: 2015-05-28 19:53:58
No, Roger offered $1m to prove Roger wrong. If anyone could prove that he PGP signed v8, which he didn't, and which this evidence proves he didn't. So Roger owes him nothing.
@_date: 2015-05-04 19:59:38
The contract wasn't as a contractor. It was part of a settlement agreement because Jed was a founder. After founders leave these are pretty commonplace.

Link to the source spreadsheet?
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:12:51
No OKcoin or Huobi? Two of the, if not the, two biggest exchanges in the world?
@_date: 2015-05-28 22:10:55
Because it's impossible to prove Ver *wrong* about PGP signing a document he never signed, which is why Roger offered $1m.
@_date: 2016-06-24 23:49:13
None of them. The model makes no sense.
@_date: 2015-08-03 21:18:12
It's a bit creepy, tbh!

Who is the central authority? Dude, do some homework.
@_date: 2016-02-24 02:16:54
*sarcastic. Ironic is different.
@_date: 2016-02-24 05:51:22
Good point, even better.
@_date: 2016-09-20 06:06:57
Ah, fair enough.
@_date: 2016-09-20 04:39:17
You didn't?
@_date: 2016-09-20 04:39:37
I probably missed some sarcasm here, but I don't get it.

Antpool are aware of this and will be following up.
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:48:49
That's a particularly subsection of "decentralised". The current banking system is somewhat decentralised (there's more than one actor, all working independently in concert with each other), but not as decentralised as a system with more participants, like bitcoin. Tying lots of independent databases together into one immuntable decentralised databases but still with the same number of participants still has benefits, without the use of hashing.
@_date: 2015-04-27 01:10:19
I think you've missed the point of his report. The banks won't use mining and so hash power is irrelevant.
@_date: 2015-11-19 21:32:56
This is so ill-informed. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:01:43
A lot of gold bugs invest in mines rather than gold itself, similar thing.
