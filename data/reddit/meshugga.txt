Oh jeez, that is *simply not true* - a fiat currency solves a specific problem that non-fiat *can not* solve - growing with economys demands. You might wish it was so, but it ain't.
What BTC actually threatens are money laundering provisions, tax income etc.

In Austria, (and I believe the whole SEPA region), any bank can withdraw from your account just using your details on behalf of their (verified companies) customers, but they will also be liable for the transfers legitimacy. That's also the reason why you can reverse any such withdrawal in a 50+days timeframe after the fact.

This is an urban legend, and not supported by current data forensic knowledge. Hard disks don't save "zeros and ones", they save a RLL encoded data stream in ever so slightly changing tracks on the hard disk which are held together by incredible science, clever software (running on the hard disk), factory parameters and a little bit of magic.
If you overwrite a sector with zeros, the data on it is gone.
If you overwrite a file with zeros, and your filesystem decides not to write those zeros in the same place on the disk, or you're using ssds which often employ a similar strategy, you might have *a very tiny* chance.
@_date: 2014-02-13 07:34:01
Sorry, that is what happens on SSDs (which I didn't go into) with the TRIM command (and sometimes very clever firmware that emulates TRIM on non-TRIM capable systems), but a hard disk does not have such a maneuver, as it is of no intrinsical use to it. If you write to a hard disk sector, the data *will be written onto the disk*, if the power doesn't go out before the cache could be emptied. It might not be the same physical sector in a very minor amount of cases when sectors are re-assigned due to error/wear, but a hard disk will not "ignore" data just because it's 0.
Any speedup you may encounter is due to the puffer on the hard disk controller and any sort of compression that may happen along the way.
Try dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX on a linux system. I promise you, there is nothing faster than using any other in-memory file or pattern in an amount of data where it matters (i.e. a multiple of the disk controllers rw cache).

How stupid must a reporter be to not take the much greater probability into account that the Bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto is someone who knows the "real" Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto and took that handle as some sort of sign of respect, or because the name sounded cool. Someone who Nakamoto worked with over the years or otherwise was inspired by him or just heard his name in passing. That's much more probable than this guy using his real name.

They are only asking you for ID, nothing more.* AML compliance is a perfectly legitimate request. If you do not want to comply with the rules of a government backed currency, then don't use it.
\* asking people with tainted coins for IDs is an excellent way to inhibit large scale laundering in small bits, which is the only good method if you want to disseminate tainted currency. If you are able to comply, it means you are not the perp, and it increases the laundering effort for the perp massively - they then need to create a lot of individually convincing faked ID scans.

From someone who once registered an snmp prefix with iana: those are the things that just need to be done, and it really doesn't matter who does it.
This registration has literally nothing to do with microsoft except that the go-to guy *on the internet* for this is someone with a microsoft email address who thought it would be a good idea to have that protocol handler properly documented. (The guy registered a bunch of other handlers too, like the one for irc://, lastfm://, ldaps://, even *magnet://*)
Yes, the iana might have considered his input stronger and faster than usual due to the microsoft address but much more likely [due to his past and current work]( But beyond that, literally anyone (with work in the field) could (and should) have registered the bitcoin scheme with iana. just so that it is done, and people implementing stuff handling uri schemes know that there might be something to support in the future. After all, it's still provisional.
And btw, since it's provisional, *anyone* can amend or dispute that entry.

Dave Thaler is an uber-expert and does a chore for the technical internet community by adding uri schemes. That's all.

It says the same "unsure, use with care" with almost every protocol.
He says that since it is about sending money, without further details, dereferencing it (i.e. processing the link to it's full meaning/starting software on it that sends money) should be considered dangerous.

I've been thinking about this problem you describe and bitcoin a long time, almost since it's inception. I don't think there's a solution within such a "currency", but it should rather be some sort of "debt clearing protocol" where everyone can open a bank and issue "money", or rather, credits. These credits may be backed by something (like bitcoin, gold, USD), and other issuers can vouch for each other that these backings actually exist. Issuers of long time good standing could even over-extend their own backings, and in this way create fiat money.
And in the end, if you want a payout for the credits you've accumulated, you initiate a clearing-chain into the currency you desire.
And the best part: it would work within the name paradigm.

@_date: 2011-06-04 11:08:26
I think you are entirely correct in your analysis, I do not however concur with the overall conclusion of "soon".
Yes, it is a bubble. Yes, it is overvalued. Yes, it's deflationary, which would be fatal for a normal economy depending on it. No, not nearly enough goods are traded with bitcoin to justify the circulation. But for the foreseeable future, bitcoin is here to stay.
What's currently happening is, that those who own bitcoins, can only make use of them by trading. But they can ask an ever increasing price, for two important reasons: whoever wants to buy bitcoins, needs it for either speculating or for illicit business. And since bitcoin is currently the only real option for conducting illicit business anonymously on the internets (be it money laundering or drug sale), it will stay this way.
Think of it as gold (or shares of a company) - the value of the commodity never represents the value of the commodity for it's individual use only - a significant part of the value is always the possible future value, which mainly consists of the hopes and fears of investors. 
And since bitcoins are a commodity with *known limited supply* that can facilitate a valuable service (conducting illicit business anonymously), the future value of bitcoins are not that hard to predict.
However, the bubble *could* burst if one of those things happen:
* governments legalize drugs
* governments find a way to crack down on bitcoin users individually (i.e. completely control the internet)
* some replacement currency with better end user experience and the same features turns up
* a large portion of bitcoin owners with big portfolios suddenly realize that the large chunk of "value" in their hands could implode at any moment
* Mt.Gox (or some other broker) implements future trading and someone pulls a Soros and bets a lot of real money against the value of bitcoins.
* There is some major flaw within the implementation or math of bitcoin that can be exploited and/or render the current ecosystem unusable
I don't doubt that bitcoin will some day meet its master. But I doubt it will be soon.

@_date: 2011-08-01 06:59:28
The blockchain is a cryptographic construct, which basically consists of transactions which are signed with private keys. Simply said, it's a long list of "I hereby declare this amount of BTC not to be mine anymore but XYs."
Those transactions are publicly available *forever*, it basically is a neverending logfile that you can not alter after the fact because everyone else would say "hey, whatcha doin there?"
So XY doesn't need to be online, because his ~~wallet~~ balance consists of all the public transactions directed towards him, minus those he directed at other wallets. The "wallet" is XYs tool to actually create outgoing transactions based on what he received. Without the wallet, he would still "own" (in a metaphysical, not practical sense) the BTCs that were directed to him, but not be able to use them.
The key to understanding the basic concept is public key cryptography, which works in short like that: you generate a laaaarge number, which is the public key. The way of constructing this number, only known to you, is the private key. Now, due to the mathematical intricacies of this process, the public key can be used by anyone to verify what you signed (also a mathematical process) with your private key, which would be bitcoin transactions that you originated. There is a lot more to it, but this is the gist that you need to understand why this "neverending logfile" works.

Came here to say something similar. The usability score for bitcoin should really have been -10, not just 0. For a normal (non-enthusiastic, non-early adopter, non-tech savvy) user, it doesn't work on so many levels:
* no real possibility to acquire bitcoins during a normal checkout (like pp or mb) with a bitcoin-cart
* no possibility *ever* of credit-card -&gt; bitcoin exchanges due to the inherently contradicting natures of both systems
* Paypal address: user vs bitcoin address: some base64 string that can change (why?), be lost and is generally a handful to understand
* No central point of reference. No "bitcoin.com" who are the go-to for any and all problems
* Delayed payment notifications depending on network conditions
* Nobody "issues" bitcoins, or payment notifications etc - there is no authority. Payment notifications are a result of the system, not of a mediating party. That's a concept that's difficult to understand for non-technological people. "where does it come from" is a question that hits that nerve.
I know what the technical ramifications are, why stuff is like it is etc. I know that some of those issues could theoretically be fixed by fragmenting bitcoin into paypal-like entities. I know that there are advantages that come with the drawbacks. 
But what the bitcoin community as a whole needs to understand is, "nobody cares", as in "people just want to be able to pay somebody over the internet without thinking too much of it and being at risk". No one is (only) interested in market volatility, in the grand scheme of things, your libertarian agenda, the looming downfall of government issued currency etc etc. 
They just want things to work. Now, everytime someone posts a comparison like this, I become very sad, because those people obviously don't put their effort in the right work. You shouldn't try and rationalize and marginalize the drawbacks of bitcoin to make it appear more attractive by rhetorics. Because as soon as somebody tries it, they know that you bullshitted them, so it's really no use. What is worse is, you'll have produced a frustrated, scared and non-returning customer.
My advice would be, be glad that there is one huge market that bitcoin can survive on until it matures, which is drugs. Understand that this is the life-boat of bitcoin now, like porn on VHS. But the only thing that will carry bitcoin into the mainstream is not pushing people to use it and make frustrating experiences, but to develop *real* payment systems on top of it. They don't exist yet, especially not with the key requirement of "make it easier than paypal and moneybookers" and "accept every major credit card without pains".

You're mixing up a few things there. It's PC to say exactly that: 'i believe Europe has taken in too many single male immigrants from conflict zones' (provided this is said within a constructive discussion)
It's not PC to say "throw out them damn muslims"
Language is powerful, and everyone wants and tries to shape it. When we as a society (not as a communist regime mind you) arrive at something that is "PC" it just means that we are trying to set a common ground on what is acceptable to discuss over. It's kind of "the edge to the right" of the overton window. The right does the same with "the edge to the left" via ridicule, which you can recognize with terms like "Gutmensch" (in german), "dreamer", "socialist/communist" (in the us", "tree hugger" etc.
And if you use words or propositions that are not PC, then you're not getting into legal trouble or anything - the only consequence is, that people re-evaluate your personality and fitness for their company. And that's their right, isn't it?
I agree that there's edge cases, but I disagree that we're keeping the overton window in a "lets accept more people as they are rather than less" state is a bad thing. And this is not only done via language btw, but we were talking about PC :)
I'll even admit that there's a bit of friendly fire as certain groups are trying to understand themselves in their new position (I'm thinking of a few 'twitter activists'). But all in all, it's mostly harmless, and it's awesome to see a new generation growing up with less bullying, more interests and broader perspectives on live, simply because less personal traits are open for ridicule or denigration.
I'm amazed that when people watch Friends today, they can clearly see where the writers went wrong and used homophobia or transphobia for bad jokes, and how it's not ok to use people for an easy laugh like that.
I like this development. Don't you? Isn't it worth a little bit of more thinking before speaking, a little bit of more arguing, a little bit of self-reflection?

I think you're right with the thick skin, but I think that's a process that takes a lot of time for each individual. But I don't think it's the responsibility of a minority to have thick skin to endure attacks, basically placating the majority that openly wonders "why should *I* change, why should *I* do something different"
I hope that in the future, thick skin is less about "shut up and take it like a man" and more about admitting fault and taking responsibility for what's grounded in emotions and what isn't. What's yours and what isn't. And then working on accepting, owning that, building on it, and evolving.
And I don't think this is or should be a right vs left thing. If at all, personal responsibility was always a concept of the "common, educated center". At least that's the impression I have.
But I do think that the right is currently leaving this process completely to the left. There seems to have been no positive societal advancement of the past 20-30 years that they took part in shaping. At least that's what it looks like to me, but I may be biased, so I would welcome examples to the opposite.

@_date: 2013-04-12 15:16:01
Or maybe their IT offers a lot of different services, some of which are non critical or not security relevant and can benefit from a cloud. Like, the public websites for example.

It's not going anywhere.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:04:16
No they did, but they might not yet have re-written their order matching engine (which is a huge and non-trivial task if you also need to dispense with the use of an off-the-shelve RDBMS for performance sake) and just continued to throw hardware at their RDBMS. They may now be at the limit of how many RAM/CPUs you can put on one board.

Ever heard of ACID compliant relational databases scaling in a "cloud"? No? Me neither.

While I don't think that they're amateurs in the technical sense (all the trading bots generate a shitload of volume, the DDOS attacks seem to be well orchestrated, yet they are still online - not a sign of incompetence in my book), I totally agree that there are aspects of this incidence that give food for thought about improvements in their communication.
The price lag thing being the most irritating.

It's not their job nor their position to create "desirable consequences" for the "in crowd" with the "out crowd" as an instrument. That kind of business practice would be disgusting.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:03:44
Since the orders are lagging and the web page/login works flawlessly, yes, I assume it's the order matching engine.
And no, there are no (fair) systems for independent order matching. But please convince me of the opposite with a source where I can look it up.
@_date: 2013-05-15 03:10:16
You are right. Maybe small governments *are* the solution, but measured in country size, not in competence :)
Although, while the EU is getting a lot of flak, they are not doing the worst job either. But I guess it's easier when your role is more that of a mediator herding cats instead of a "real" federal government...
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:30:27
You would be foolish to prefer an outsourced "cloud" to inhouse hosting for what Mt. Gox does.
No bank is doing that, and that should tell you something.
In-house cloud however (Openstack or homecooked cloud concepts) is already the way to go, it's just a good way of managing your infrastructure and deployments. But it still does require you to posess the needed hardware.
And database servers are an entirely different thing altogether, those do not fit well at all in the cloud scaling paradigm.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:35:52
Because cloud instances traditionally perform worse for systematic bottlenecks like databases than dedicated hardware.
And no, it's not secure enough for the core of financial transactions. That's why no bank does it.
And no, the video you provided is about a data management service for financial firms - nothing to do with realtime trading or anything relevant to the matter. And certainly not the NASDAQ order matching system, which is the part that would be comparable.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:20:47
DB does not imply in or out of memory. Every order matching engine needs a database, otherwise it wouldn't be able to look up or sort orders.


Great, and it's surely easy as pie to adapt and integrate them during lunch break.
I'm always in awe how some people, despite apparently having experience, completely fail to see complexity, limitations, time requirements and proper procedures when someone else does something.
The systems you speak of are also *insanely* expensive, are almost never touched after they are set up and do not "scale" beyond splitting up commodities (which Mt. Gox has *one* of).
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:05:51
It would also be a severe trust issue.

You can tell the rails coder from the trifecta:
* Misunderstanding of core concepts of relational databases
* Happy go lucky attitude with security concerns
* "Cloud" as a valid answer to any question regarding scaling
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:05:16
Mostly security considerations. You can't just outsource infrastructure that handles real money in the way Mt. Gox does.
Suddenly, there's only a password or a security issue at Amazon between the hacker and the gold.

Gotta say, I like my little Austria pretty well too. Not that there is no corruption (on the contrary), but it ususally takes at most two elections to clean it all out. And the money lost isn't too bad compared to what actually works.

@_date: 2013-04-12 17:28:42
repeat after me: YOU CANT SCALE WITH MORE INSTANCES WHEN STRONG LOCKING IS REQUIRED WHICH ORDER MATCHING SYSTEMS DO.
It's insane how much misinformation even informed people have when it comes to databases.
And yes, even a custom order matching engine needs a database. You maybe won't see it as a seperate entity, but it is there.
It's not about "scalable systems being hard", it's about theoretical and physical limitations of the process you are modelling. Some things *just don't scale horizontally*, in fact, trying to horizontally scale with strict locking usually makes matters worse. This problem is so bad, that relational databases and other applications with shared memory locking tend to slow down with more CPUs if the queries are data intensive instead of CPU intensive.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:41:25
Absolutely, but a RDBMS used for order matching can also fit in ram and can be blazing fast.
But my point is, no matter how you implemented it (and I assume it's currently in a postgres, as it's less development overhead and very well tested), you still need locality for the order data. There is no way around that. You can "distribute" some of the workload, but one single server still needs to lock for the transaction itself, and this is where all the cloud gospel implodes eventually.
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:16:46
There's a lot of grey to black money in those banks. It's basically a big "fuck you and don't come back/do it again" to a certain clientel, and to the cyprus economy and political landscape that based their GDP on that.
They are (and I am) not sorry who they are taking it from, because those people "invested" there *for a reason*. Especially if the alternative is letting either cyprus crash or pay grey/black/tax evasion money accounts back from european *tax payers*.

I think he's talking about the level of delusion you have to buy into, not about policy decisions.
I find myself in the same state of mind when discussing economics with communists or libertarians (or "anarcho-capitalists"), or discussing societal policies with extreme right/left wing nuts, or religious folk. My whole head is pounding, I just want to scream "HAVE YOU THOUGHT THIS THROUGH AT ALL". But the worst part is, those people really think they did, while obviously lacking the mental capacity and/or know-how and/or experience... Where do you go from there? Literally Hitler.

But Amazon can't do that. They only provide MySQL as a SaaS (which is a joke), and their best instances are not nearly as fit as what you can custom-build.


What you're forgetting is, to do that is part of your core business. If you do not have the competent people for it, you shouldn't do it at all.
Think about this for a moment: How many people at amazon (network engineers, system operators, coders, floor hands, support staff etc) have access to the aws infrastructure that shouldn't have access to Mt. Gox infrastructure? How high are the stakes? You can actually start a new life in Belize as a millionaire by raiding just the online bitcoin reserve of mtgox or divert payouts.
While there is relatively nothing to gain for an amazon employee by disabling reddit or copying tumblr data, there is a *lot* to gain in regards to Mt. Gox. It would even pay off to infiltrate Amazon just for planning and executing that coup.
Mt. Gox would have to put implicit and blind faith into amazon (or any managed hosting provider) to outsource to them. Would you do that if you were in their shoes? Just so you can avoid that one downtime when something unexpected happens and your usual two thirds reserve doesn't suffice?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:11:05


And they are having *severe* problems when they require high perfomance RDBMS. The notorious reddit outages were a good example for that, despite the fact that they didn't even need strong ACID compliance like Mt. Gox does.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:10:48
There is cloud for webservers, mailservers, DNS, ... and then there are relational databases that require locality to comply with ACID efficiently.
Only people with a severely limited understanding of how RDBMS work can just shout "cloud" and be done with it. The reality is different.
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:51:48
The thing is, bitcoin is not really a currency - it is a commodity used as a currency. And a commodity bows to supply &amp; demand, and if there's no demand because the main economic factor is out, then there will be too much supply.

Yes, but there is increasing pressure on banks to conform to international AML/finance standards.
Look at for example people who deal with Liberty Reserver or similar: it's *ultra hard* for them to get a reliable IBAN/ACH bank account without strict and enforced AML policies and being licensed as a kind of financial institution. And it's not the company that enforces those rules, but the banks providing the accounts - otherwise they risk their ostrification from the bank networks.

He gave us some valuable insight into his world. Don't be an ass.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:33:15
Yes, please, more buzzwords.
Order matching requires tight and hard constraints that are usually provided and enforced by a relational database, which in turn requires locality to do that.
Of course you can develop an engine that does that without the help of a RDBMS, but it will be *vastly* more complicated (and thus buggier), and you still won't be able to get around locality - the same major impediment to scaling RDBMS in a cloud environment.

@_date: 2013-03-29 15:02:41
There's also another side to this, what OP isn't telling us: cypriot banks (especially Laiki, that's also why it got hit so hard) are notorious for taking funds with less due dilligence than most of the rest of the SEPA attached banks.
You go to a cypriot bank if you need an offshore account for your offshore mailbox company owned by a swiss trust fund managed by a lawyer acting as trustee. You only need to do this to launder the money when the origin of your money is questionable, such as tax evasion, grey market (illegal downloads/torrent trackers), drug income etc. You may say "but this can be traced" - well, yes, but only if a states attourney cares enough to employ a lot of resources (including a lot of translations, need for interpreters, local cooperation with LE etc). So as long as you don't step on anybody's foot or at least conceal the footstepping enough, you're golden.
In *any other case* you'd not go to banks in Cyprus, Malta, Gibraltar etc. You simply don't. If you have clean money and want it secure with good service, low fees and a bit of interest, you'd go to Deutsche Bank, Raiffeisen, HSBC, ... 
Those cypriot banks are not just wibbly-wobbly because of the recent crisis, they also take huge fees for those kinds of operations, give almost no interest and sometimes may even hold your funds for ransom when they get a whiff of that they might be ill gotten.

Sorry, I was talking about RDBMS. And RDBMS *are* the right tool for the job.
Locality is an issue for order matching, as it requires locks. I'm not saying you're using the wrong tools or anything for whatever you do, but for what Mt. Gox is doing, RDBMS is the only way to go. Or you develop your own order matching system as a trimmed down version of the functionality of an RDBMS, which will still require locality.

There are no "extra servers" when it comes to databases. That's the problem. Even on multicore systems locality matters to a degree that it impacts scaling.
