And you've seen even an iota of actual evidence to support the collusion claims? I know you'll say there are a bunch of democrats claiming to have evidence but nobody has actually produced any evidence, because there isn't any. Protip: The democrats and their propaganda machine lie to you constantly in order to manipulate you into voting for them. Russian collusion was one of those lies. So is most of everything else they say.

I see the collusion delusion is still alive and well! Explain to me how exposing the corruption of democrats by releasing their own unedited emails is "Russian Propoganda". LMAO

 propaganda:
    The systematic propagation of a doctrine or cause or of information reflecting the views and interests of those advocating such a doctrine or cause.
    Material disseminated by the advocates or opponents of a doctrine or cause: wartime propaganda.
The democrats have literally been doing this since day 1 with Russian collusion. They just keep repeating the same baseless accusation, amplified by their media partners, in an attempt to take down their political adversary. 
The number of investigations is pretty irrelevant considering NONE of them were about Russian collusion but a bunch of unrelated process crimes and tax evasion.
The investigation was unwarranted because the root cause wasn't Trump colluding with Russia to win an election, it was another attempt by the democrats to take down their political adversary. Think about it...so many logical inconsistencies...
What do the "words coming out of your president's mouth" have to do with democrat propaganda/misinformation? Ever think that the same people lying to you about collusion might doctor some videos to make the president seem bad?

I disagree, his associates have committed crimes but Trump has not. Here are some undeniable facts for you:
*1) Cohen is a lying piece of shit. Proven, lied to congress.
*2) Cohen will say anything the democrats tell him to, to reduce his sentence. Democrats literally coached him on what to say to congress.
*3)You're using a Lanny Davis quote (long time friend and attorney of the Clintons) as proof of a crime? You've got to be kidding....
*4)Who ended up paying the hush money in the end? Trump. So I disagree about the entire premise that it was a campaign contribution. It's a real stretch to call it that, but hey, anything to get Trump right?. Furthermore, the precedent set by the democrats in regards to campaign finance violations makes the accusations just ridiculous. Double standards.
*5)"There are undeniable facts the Trump and his associates have committed crimes" Completely disagree, what crime did Trump commit? 
*6)Follow-up to 5, "In total, Cohen pleaded guilty to five counts of tax evasion, one count of making false statements to a financial institution, one count of willfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution, and one count of making an excessive campaign contribution." There is nothing about crimes Trump committed, or in the rest of the article except for the bullshit coming out of the clinton's attorney's mouth. 
*7)Even if there were campaign finance violations, when a candidate violates campaign finance laws, it's a violation, not a crime, and you pay a fine. Just ask Obama, he got nailed for 1+ million and paid a fine while democrats/media gave him a pass. That sets a precedent, and I expect that everyone get treated equally? Right?
*8)This is all coming out of the SDNY, which:
*a)Is run by high level democrats.
*b)Best case scenario has a ridiculous anti-Trump bias, worst case is flat out corrupt and is playing their part in trying to take down Trump.
*9)By trying to argue that Trump committed crimes, based on a quote by an attorney to the highest ranking democrats, you really exposed the fact that you have not a clue of what's actually going on here.
*10)Don't take my word for it, look it up for yourself. Perhaps take a peek at the information sources the democrats vehemently argue you shouldn't be looking at. Try to reconcile the information. STOP TAKING THE MEDIA'S WORDS AS TRUTH, INCLUDING FOX NEWS

Still on your knees slurping up what your marxist masters are "dishing out", huh.

I don't have to tell myself anything. We knew Russian collusion was democrat propaganda all along, and we were correct. Again.

Dude according to who? Trump's opposition SDNY, Lanny Davis and do anything to save his ass Michael Cohen? You're still not getting it...just because "they" said so doesn't make it true. COHEN'S "LAWYER" WORKS FOR THE CLINTONS AND THE ONLY REASON HE'S SAYING IT IS SO HE DOESN'T SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN JAIL. Of course they are going to say it's illegal. They'll say anything. Again I would like to bring up points 1,2,4, 6,7,8. Politicians lie to get their way, democrats being the worst. I laid out a bunch of valid points and all you can say is: "the people on the TV said he's guilty so it must be" and "a bunch of people agree with what the first guy said so it's definitely true."

"warped version of reality" lol I'm not the one still insisting there is collusion, without evidence, even AFTER a 2+ year investigation by your own corrupt party.
