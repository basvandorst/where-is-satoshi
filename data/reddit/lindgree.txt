it's actually in the auction rules that nobody can participate on his behalf

Of course the policy is more nuanced than that.
It's OK to discuss altcoins when pushing SegWit.
It's also OK to discuss BU (an alleged altcoin) if it's in the context of shitting on it.

Why are we allowing this garbage post about an alt coin?

Willing to entertain this idea, however:  The beauty of longest chain = bitcoin is that it's objective and easy to verify.  Your definition is not.
"Strongest" is defined how?  I suppose you could point to the total amount of PoW done, but that doesn't help if the PoW algo changes or security is switched to something else like PoS.  Similarly, "valid" is defined how?  This is the really troublesome word.
The only thing immutable about the blockchain is what has happened in the past.  Any number of protocol changes could make your definition really difficult to evaluate in the future.
And even if you could define these terms objectively, it's not immediately obvious to me that the longest chain would ever be any different from the "strongest valid chain."

The "original" is the longest blockchain, period.  Read the whitepaper.

Is this kind of post what the bitcoin community is all about?

The idea that the U.S. government could, consistent with the First Amendment, prohibit someone from saying that they accept bitcoin in exchange for goods and services, is absolutely ridiculous.  Any law would almost certainly be swiftly shut down by the first honest judge who had the chance.

Money laundering statutes are the primary concern for organizations worried about accepting bitcoin (especially EFF; I was there two summers ago when they decided to stop taking bitcoin).  I think this concern is waning, however, as more and more "legit" merchants/businesses start accepting it.  We are beyond the days (or are we?) when bitcoin was a purely underground, primarily drug-sale currency.

It depends on the terms of your contract with the bank.  You probably agreed not to sue them.  Also you probably agreed they could pretty much do whatever they wanted.  And by "you" I mean everyone.
