Just like life, we would find a way :-P 
Internet in Cuba is highly controlled, yet many have access to the same content as you and me. Not as fast, but it gets there. Same thing in China, for those who know english.

Not sure if the data is correct though.

Assuming these stats are correct, the drop is probably related to BTC price falling, not because of the resources needed to run a full node.

How do you know if someone that dresses, acts, and looks like a cop is a fake cop?

Good point, but how do you know that the number of full nodes is shrinking then? Just like them, we can't see all nodes.
Assuming that one IP connection = full node is probably a bad way of tracking the number of nodes. Many ISPs rotate IPs (same node will use multiple IPs) while others started using NAT solutions because they don't have enough IPs and more users use Tor/VPN connections now (same IP, multiple nodes).
Edit: to the people downvoting, what's for if we can't ask questions?

Sometimes I have to receive international payments from other people. Before exchanging bank account details (iban, swift, etc) I tell them in advance: I also accept Bitcoin, we can use it if you want to avoid all the hassle.
Most don't own Bitcoin, but it's nice to have something that works by just exchanging a wallet address. Fees/speed should be improved though... I know about Lightning, but at the moment it isn't that easy to use.
