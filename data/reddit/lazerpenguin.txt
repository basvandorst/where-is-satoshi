and I used to be a bank of america customer, so that should say something about the the shitty customer service I've dealt with.

Well when this was all going down I did send you the order info through here. Should still be in your inbox.

"I have no idea about Instawallet. That's completely separate from BitInstant. Sorry."
This is the oh so helpful email response I got. Word of advice STAY AWAY FROM BITINSTANT 
Seriously worst customer service I've dealt with.

bitcoinstar sounds like a reality tv show :p

On the front page of instawallet it says please do not deposit bitcoins while we undergo maintenance. Do you think it'll still be there? Thanks for the reply

+1 bitfloor. I first tried bitinstant and they are terrible! bitfloor is the only way to go! I had my bitcoins in less than an hour and for less fees than bitinstant. It's been 5 days now and still nothing from bitinstant. Worse email responses too.

thanks, I've been freaking out about this whole thing for weeks now. Then I finally hear about putting in a claim, only for it to be shot down by a lame 404 was just another blow to my hope for ever getting that money back. I'll have a beer and check back in an hour.

Hey my url still shows a 404, anyone else getting this?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:26:22
It says:
 Instawallet is closed
Visit your wallet's URL to file a claim.
but when I click on my bookmark of my wallets url I get a 404. Any thoughts?

Dont even get me started on BitInstant, they really are the worst. Been 2 months and still waiting on 2 coins.

I'm hoping the servers are just overworked right now. Has anyone else had this problem?
