Yes. But would you give credence to a what a random person claimed, someone with zero credentials and without investigating whether those credentials seemed sketchy? Especially about the stock market?????
I just saw a post about being scammed posted to r/business. The individual hadn't bothered to ascertain whether or not that was the proper place to post his or her tale of woe, hadn't bothered to see if there might be a another sub that would actually be of some help - all of which would have taken a few seconds. And that person is wondering how he or she was scammed.

Absolutely and bitcoin will be worthless.
Now, are you going to give credence to a what a random person on the internet claims?

The bill was introduced in the House 1/3/207. Iran announced the change on Jan 29th.

Hypothesis, not a theory.

I am old. Not many of my compadres have ever heard of bitcoin and I imagine many will go to their graves never having heard of bitcoin.

"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. are among eight large U.S. banks that may have credit grades cut by Standard &amp; Poor’s on the prospect that the U.S. government is less likely to provide aid in a crisis."

I'm 68 and I am excited by bitcoin.
I mentioned it to an economist friend of mine years ago, said it was going to be huge (or yuge as they say now) and he was *rather* dismissive.

He very clearly says something contradictory on a daily basis.

What a fucking moron. I was listening to NPR in the car and and an economics commentator was talking about his tax plan, how onw one day he says he will cut taxes for the 1% and the next day he says he might raise them for the 1%.
The guy sounded like he was going to cry. He said how do you report on someone who says something contradictory every time he opens his mouth?

I watched The Big Short Last night and then see this first thing this morning on reddit. Internet synchronicity strikes again.
