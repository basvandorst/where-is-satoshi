Can you elaborate on the risk of having your UK bank account frozen because of transferring money to an exchange? 
You explained a lot above but I'm confused if the accounts at risk are those of the individuals or the exchanges. The final paragraph suggests the former or perhaps both. 
I have made four transfers to two exchanges. Two were to a UK exchange and two were SEPA transfers to an EU bank. There has been one SEPA transfer back to my account. 
I would like to assess the risk of my account being frozen
Thanks for your thoughtful comment.

Is it? It was painless for me (from UK) and much quicker than Coinbase (from US account).

I thought I might have been at risk because of that paragraph.
I was concerned that any transfers to and from and account itself suspected of fraud (or being used to aid fraud, as it seems is the case here, even if it is down to inexperience) might put me at risk.

How can you tell what the price is? Where are you getting that? I see $154 on Clark Moody and I saw as low as $110 on BitStamp (maybe even 90 but I'm starting to question myself on that one...)
Still though... so much lag.

I too used to use Blockchain.info and in terms of speed you are no doubt correct, BitStamp is much slower. 
Still, BitStamp is an exchange and you can transfer money in an decide when to jump in.
