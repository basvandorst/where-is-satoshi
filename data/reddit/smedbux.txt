If Paypal didn't have a ToS that was signed by the vendor, Paypal's efforts could easily be considered illegal under section 2 of the Sherman Act of 1890. Businesses are not free to do as they choose.

Well they aren't really advertising the competitor *through* them per se; they're just advertising the competitor and using Paypal at the same time.
Being in the position that Paypal is in is not inherently illegal, but whenever Paypal makes a move to "box out" the competition, whether or not the seller signed an agreement with Paypal, Paypal is violating the Sherman Act. See the [Microsoft antitrust lawsuit]( in which Microsoft (among other things) signed an agreement with Dell to force Internet Explorer on Dell computers instead of allowing Dell to promote Netscape (research showed consumers liked Netscape more than I.E.).
If Paypal were to directly stipulate that vendors using its service couldn't use Bitcoin as well, Paypal would be violating antitrust legislation. This restriction is why Paypal doesn't just openly prevent Bitcoin affiliation in the first place. The reason Paypal was able to "go after" this vendor and not be prosecuted was because Paypal could pretty much just pick any reason out of its ToS as to why funds were frozen, etc.
**TL;DR** Antitrust legislation prevents Paypal from openly requiring its users to be Bitcoin-free because that would be an abuse of monopoly power. They just attacked this specific vendor because their ToS basically lets them shut down whomever they please.
I'm an economist, not a lawyer, so I don't know too much about the legal specifics; but I can assure you the Sherman Act is a big thing they teach you in Microeconomics and it's taken very seriously.
