Nah, I expected this. Just wanted to point out because honestly, I think they are just manipulating the price by making up these problems. They  cause panic and see the price drop, and buy cheap bitcoins. Well, that's what I suspect is going on. Now I'll let myself out to @_date: 2014-03-27 02:47:50
Most of the money is there tho. Population is irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:30:25
That's sad...
@_date: 2014-03-22 03:19:22
This is huge. If the fee goes down a little bit, just so many people might start using this. Also, credit card deposits will be awesome.
@_date: 2014-05-01 11:47:51
Yeah, I am [still alive]( and trading.
How about you? [Are you still there?](
The entire dialogue is relevant. :)
Bitcoin is science.
@_date: 2014-04-20 06:16:58
I had cavirtex, but had no other way to turn fiat into bitcoin in Canada. Also the verification takes too long, and is too invasive if you ask me.
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:31:49
Wow. I really wish you get your bitcoin back. This is sickening. How much bitcoin was Gox supposed to have in storage? I really want to know why this happened.
@_date: 2014-04-22 12:18:24
I guess I am leaving Cavirtex for VoS. Carvirtex was the worst.
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:03:58
It has disaster written all over it.
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:06:05
Thanks for info. VoS was not there when I bought my first coin, but I mean to use it from hereon.
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:41:50
People learn about finances operationally.
Without seeing intuitive front-ends for payment methods like those for Paypal, debit, and credit cards, people will not perceive Bitcoin as a payment method.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:07:08
Wow... People have a lot of money.
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:54:54
What happened?
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:26:33
Please, elaborate. This gonna be good. Also, I think you get why I posted this in the first place.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:36:45
That made me chuckle.
@_date: 2014-05-01 13:32:17
How about [*Want You Gone*](
I would like to think GLaDOS as Gox, and Chell as Bitcoin.
GLaDOS put Chell through a series of experiments that seemed benign at first, but later turned out to be designed to kill Chell. Chell survives the impending doom, and finally escapes the evil that took so many things away from her. I hope she is in a happy place now.
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:31:17
Now it really feels like Gox is just into price manipulation. They just want to buy 'em cheap.
@_date: 2014-02-06 04:19:01
Can you withdraw bitcoin from Gox now?
I thought you can't even withdraw bitcoin from it.
@_date: 2014-09-18 03:07:53
Still waiting for that invite.
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:23:07
looks like systematic money laundering.
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:56:58
It might be due to long term customers of Mt. Gox moving their dusty bitcoin out of Mt. Gox. To be safe, you know.
@_date: 2014-05-02 08:19:40
Maybe they have bought a bunch of bitcoin as fall-backs. Now they are just doing w/e since they profit either way. In fact, they profit more this way since they can keep both bitcoin lovers and haters as customers in the future. It can't take too long for Paypal to turn themselves into a coinbase copy in addition to what they already are. Even the color palettes of the logos are similar.
@_date: 2014-09-18 07:05:48
They are missing these features?
These are pretty important features.
I haven't got to try Circle yet, but if these features are indeed missing, I'll simply wait until they are implemented.
@_date: 2014-02-17 06:51:02
I got the reference without watching the video, and I am proud.
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:30:24
I hope it comes back soon. Maybe I should move to Bitstamp.
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:44:38
Unless it says "MtGox Was an Inside Job 2011," it's still relevant. It will be a hit at Bitcoin conferences. And if it turns out to be an inside job, you can boast your intuition before all of us. I promise you a reddit gold if such turns out to be the case. ;)
@_date: 2014-03-30 13:34:12
I just noticed it too.
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:37:42
Sounds like a nightmare.
@_date: 2014-02-10 09:09:50
Much shame.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:34:23
...Pie chart?
@_date: 2014-05-01 04:55:48
I think this was intended as a pun, but I think this is exactly what we need and what we will get in the future.
Equal opportunity for education for people, and high transparency and verifiability of the degrees and certificates received. This can be done if some people constantly monitor each others' progress, and add certainty points to one's credentials. The number of certainty points  that can be added is based on the auditor's own credibility and so on.
The current education system is as unfair and corruptible as the current financial system. Some may call it daydreaming, but I think that's what's going to happen.
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:32:15
If BTC-e shows the proof, I am going right back in.
@_date: 2014-05-01 05:02:14

The number of certainty points  that can be added is based on the auditor's own credibility and so on. This way people with more education, experience, or training (professors, teachers, employers, schools, experts in the field or other people who can more effectively validate credentials) can give credits to people. Like Github but more quantitative and all-inclusive.
I really like what GitHub is doing to the field of computer science, and how it is accepted as a better credential than most degrees. This is certainly a way towards equal opportunities and anti-class-ism.
The current education system is as unfair and corruptible as the current financial system. Some may call it daydreaming, but I think that's what's going to happen to our education.
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:32:04
About time really.
@_date: 2014-04-01 01:20:49
Buy before May, and make fortune.
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:29:03
Cool. Wish it was more elaborate though.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:37:57
Let's hope there's no way but up from hereon. Little bumps are fine. People losing all of their BTC is not fine.
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:33:08
Is this for real? Where could the bitcoin have gone?
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:48:57
I appreciate the simplicity.
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:28:27
That's a 50:50 bad or really bad chances. I like how you put numbers on your guesses!
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:39:02
Well done. Yes, the major selling point of Bitcoin is low transaction fee, and the adjustment had not quite caught up with the rising price.
