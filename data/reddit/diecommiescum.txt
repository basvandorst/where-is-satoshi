Smart Contracts are basically simple programs that can be stored and run on the blockchain. Ethereum has this functionality directly on it's primary chain, which is why it shits the bed during big events like people playing with nano pets. This is also why ETH is a shitcoin and can never be money.
Being a side-chain, RSK allows these features without interfering with the main chain. It can be merge mined, meaning existing bitcoin miners can mine it without additional overhead along with bitcoin.
Because the sidechain doesn't require the same rules as the main chain, it has faster blocks and can therefore do more transactions, which condense back on the main chain.

The difficulty adjustment creates an economic disincentive against inefficient mining, so as the price levels off when it's rise is complete, energy use won't funded by speculation/rising prices. This necessitates, as a matter of economics, that electricity won't be wasted as it won't be profitable because it has to compete with efficient mining such as hashing water heaters.

It can only be positive for these reasons:
* The futures themselves are paper and can't manipulate the market, it would require a market manipulator to buy the coin before shorting- thus creating a pump before the dump.
* Shorts are offset by longs.
* Futures are a tool for companies looking to enter the space without risk... this makes it possible for a PayPal/Venmo to integrate Bitcoin without the risk of Bitcoin they hold crashing. This is an adoption catalyst.
* The short term volatility it can cause will only attract more money trying to arbitrage it.

The paper wallet generators are just javascript that uses gibberish input to randomly generate a seed and thus generate public/private key pairs.
Since it is so lightweight, it's handy for offline (cold storage) use. 
The downside is also the benefit, the key needs to be imported or swept into a connected wallet in order to spend. As such, it's good for long term holding as you can keep the paper wallet in a safe. 
There are websites that serve this code, including ones that serve malicious versions of this code, so best to download a trusted one directly from github and run it offline (being a clean system that can't possibly have malware on it to effect or steal keys):

None of those scenarios are logical, and charts can't predict the behavior of people, and people are ultimately behind the price.
We have every reason to believe the futures catalyst brings money into the market, so no crash. It can't go to 3-5M quickly because there aren't yet enough onramps... need a few years for that at least.

Bitcoin is not a product and at this point it really won't benefit from more awareness. A better use of funds rather than a commercial would be creation of a product or service company that offers something people want, but only sells it in bitcoin.

The mempool would seem to indicate that plenty of people are using it as a currency... more than it can handle in fact.
Hodling is not mutually exclusive to use as a currency, it simply means that you replace your spend as to not reduce your hodl.

Economic science isn't that hard to grasp, I suggest trying it.
Wealth can't exist without wealth creation. Wealth is not a zero-sum game. Poverty is the result of not creating wealth, it has nothing to do with distribution.
You could not have a dollar or satoshi to your name, but if you have all the physical possessions and servants you could ever need then what's the difference? 
This is why keynesians have it backwards, they think inflation is the creation of wealth, when it's the creation of wealth that inflates currencies to certain goods.

A sidechain could easily be its own payment network, which then would consolidate transactions on the main chain.
Let's pretend sidechain "Bitcoin Payment Network" gets big, you transfer your funds to a BPN Wallet and pay BPN retailers... that side chain could have fast, large blocks... then just the end results of all those transactions get posted in a single transaction on the main chain.
It's conceivable that a sidechain payment network could work fluidly within bitcoin but allow or orders of magnitude more transactions. 
If Roger Ver wasn't a terrorist and had competent developers, he'd have created a payments side-chain rather than a contentious fork.

You realize that in fiat, which depreciates, negative interest rates are occurring throughout the world? Market forces create a race to the bottom for fees... go look at the Poloniex lending tab for an anecdote. 
For that matter, large nodes aren't even required, if you're making a large transaction there's no reason to use LN... on-chain fees are still a pittance for large transactions. 
Furthermore, nodes BTC isn't "inaccessible" any more than dollars in your wallet are inaccessible vs. your checking account.
The most logical result is most transactions will route through large retailers or sub-networks. A single R/Bitcoin channel could reach far enough to take a significant burden off the chain.

The creator intentionally misleads with regards to how routes will be found.
The sending node does not need to go out and map the network for each send, routing is done at each hop such that no hop knows what hop comes after the next. The number of hops gets reduced as the network gets bigger, not larger.
This helps ensure anonymity, decentralization, and distributed overhead.

* Bitcoin has created green electricity arbitrage by attracting mining operations to low-cost green electricity markets, like Quebec.
* Bitcoin still uses a fraction of the electricity of cubicle slaves sitting in a bank headquarters figuring out which war they need to fund and which congress critter needs a handy.

We'll likely see cycles of this for a long time, each taking a new form. Pareto's Principle says it should be 80/20, the question is which side of that Bitcoin ends up on.
Right now, shitcoins of no value that have potential pumpability are hot. Centralized garbage? Nothing but a whitepaper? Only one place for it to go... UP! 
That's the mentality right now.
Project that deliver value? An insanely profitable Binance who is doing a buyback/burn? Trading at like 1x earnings while the stock market trades at 20x. 
Eventually people will flock to value. Since there's little value out there, we should see a return to 80% eventually. Once more legitimate ICO's deliver, and the ICO market resembles the stock market and not a scam list, we may end up back at the 20% level.

The scalability issues with Monero are orders of magnitude more limiting than with Bitcoin. BTC does 100x the transactions without breaking a sweat and is on the precipice of being able to handle orders of magnitude more.
When the forks stop, we can discuss again, but for all intents and purposes... Monero is alpha software... Bitcoin is at least in Beta. 
Privacy by default doesn't matter if satisfactory privacy is available on demand. You'll have to substantiate your opinion otherwise. If anonymous transactions are effectively anonymous, non-anonymous transactions are immaterial. If you'd like to make the case that Merkle Tree + Shnorr + CJ transactions aren't sufficiently anonymous, you'll have to make that case specifically.... not simply state that it's not enough because they're not default. 
Just because Monero is better than 99% of the shitcoins out there doesn't mean it's a viable mass-market alternative to BTC. The first mover advantage resulting in network effect and thus network security cannot be dismissed. If BTC fails to achieve cryptocurrency nirvana, how much can you really trust what comes up behind it? If BTC fails, confidence in cryptocurrency will be so shaken that no other crypto will have a chance at meaningful adoption for at least another 10 years. 
Monero is one of the few altcoins I won't call an outright shitcoin, it's a great development project and I hope they make some breakthroughs we can adopt, but to pretend it's a contender anytime in the foreseeable future is asinine.

No, they don't. Early adopters who cashed out a small fortune may, but because they converted to fiat their bank would have a record and consequently report to the IRS. The average person who made a few hundred or maybe even a few thousand did not. In fact, compliance is actually impossible as by law you'd have to report buying a coffee with profits.
There was also no income tax here before 1913, so cash/gold kept the state very limited. Wires and Banks are what enabled income and wealth tracking. With bitcoin, there are no transmitters or banks to do their dirty work.

Shitchains and atomic swaps will have their use cases, even if its just automatic conversion of revenue to shareholder dividends.

I agree that the general stasis needs improved security, but you are conflating trading accounts (which may as well be dog tracks) with wallets (which like blockchain, may as well be Bank of America).
Any noob semi-proficient with PHP can write a bitcoin exchange, it's folly to think those will ever be secure in totality. It is more important to focus on education in that coins cannot be trusted in such places.
I use coinbase and consider it the most trustworthy exchange (yes I know its not truly an exchange), and immediately move coins out of it because so long as they are in it I have absolute zero control over them. This applies with every exchange, zero control is the problem, not the exchanges themselves.

Market feedback got most people out of Gox long before this happened, because it was obvious how bad they sucked and how good the competition was by comparison, there was no false sense of security. What good does the FDIC do you if the dollar collapses? zero.

I'm not sure there is a dedicated smear campaign going on. For the most part, the only MSM I watch with any regularity is CNBC (which is all about money and markets), and they are generally good about covering it fairly and having a bitcoin bull to counter any bitcoin naysayer.
Regarding the "bad news" and how that effects adoption, I think those impacts are minimal. It's not important to identify peoples feelings to it, but rather what kind of people there are.
* Younger people who are native to it, who focus on the pro's.
* Older, inquisitive people that will learn on their own and see the pro's with the con's.
* Older, bullheaded types who will reject anything new, only seeing con's.
* Mentally lazy of all ages who will not get into it (yet) because its not easily digested.
The last group is the swing group, as it becomes more consumer friendly we'll win some of them, bad news might also dissuade push some further away however. As kids today that are too young to appreciate all meanings of "money", a certain percentage of them will grow up as adopters and taking from group 4 and adding to group 1.
These groups being what they are, lets look at who the reporters/journalist are writing the negative articles. I am willing to bet, that with very little exception, the naysayer opinion pieces are written by either lazy or bullheaded individuals. Reporting on the Gox exchange stuff, shit happens, 500mill is in limbo, that's real news by any metric. The conjecture after the fact again is easily attributed to these personality types.

The margin call system makes it highly unlikely you'd lose your capital because a borrower went broke, but of course you're trusting Poloniex not to get hacked or otherwise disappear your coins.
If you autorenew at .08% it works out to roughly 30%/year APY.

Not the OP but i'll advocate for him, even though I responded on the debunk side.
His issue seems to be that deflation at the surface should seem to cause hoarding and as a result "pricing out" newcomers, thus creating boom/bust cycles.
I can only presume they're ignoring that even inflationary fiat goes through crushing deflationary cycles, that objects constantly improving and getting cheaper (TV, CPU's, Cell Phones) sell best. He also doesn't quite understand that being priced out of bitcoin can't really happen, as fractions of a bitcoin work just the same as a whole bitcoin.

Yes, blockchain.info lets me export the private key for the address where I've had coin up until today. However, when I use that private key in ABC/Electron, it imports a different address with no transaction history. It's like blockchain.info is giving me the wrong private key.

Even us OG's have some bags. But it's important to remember that's what they are, bags.
Investing in alt-coins is like investing in scratchoff tickets. Sometimes it pays, but usually they end up in the trash.
The narrative that Bitcoin has run and others have more room to run is one of the most ignorant things someone can say, because if you're familiar with what makes Bitcoin unique you realize it cannot be replicated, and how far it's run has **zero** impact on how far it could run. It's ceiling is only limited by how much fiat exists in the world, the same limit alts have.
Furthermore, if Bitcoin were ever to get its heels nipped by something else, would you really trust that something else to not get nipped too? If Bitcoin loses supremacy in the next decade then this space is probably rekt for 2 decades because no one will trust the new top dog not to get usurped.
We're not talking MySpace vs. Facebook with this shit, we're talking TCP/IP vs. Appletalk.

Suffice it to say there is no universally agreed upon meaning for the word "liable" in this context.


Taxes are illegitimate, thus, no one legitimately owes anything. There is only what the government **has determined** we owe, and unless your gains are reported- they can't determine your crypto gains are owed.


Bitcoin is valuable as a currency as it marks the countdown to the death of sweeping taxation.

Do you even crypto?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:54:43
That's only the supply side of the equation, the demand is the unknown. It's safe to assume however that 21M will never be in circulation for M3 calculation purposes, as 3-4M are already expected to be lost, and of the remaining mined, only 5M are actively being circulated according to analytics.
This means, that in the short term, everyone is basically bidding over 5M coins, which creates a liquidity crunch. 
Let's pretend Venmo wants to invest $10M into Bitcoin to sell through their app, at $10k we would figure that to be 1000 bitcoin... but that requires 1000 bitcoins be sold for $10,000, which there may not be, thus driving up the price.

Price doesn't matter. Crypto is the future of money, it's convertibility to fiat is only for the short-sighted.

Gold exchanges are centralized, gold storage is mostly centralized. Anything you think they're doing is only made possible by these two facts.

@_date: 2017-11-17 01:26:33
Being able to trace currency on the blockchain != being able to prove taxable gains or ownership. 
Let's say you used some KYC service like Coinbase, the IRS could easily find out how much bitcoin you bought and to what addresses you sent it. They may be able to prove who owns those addresses, such as exchanges or certian merchants.
That's where it ends, if you sent to an exchange they can't prove you gained. If you sent to an exchange they can't even prove it was your exchange account.
If you're still paranoid (quit with the fucking cop dramas man) and want to do something real shady, you can always tumble in and out of another chain and back again.


Bitcoin is about freedom. Freedom is anarchy. It's not about "getting away" with anything, you're right there, because you're not doing anything wrong by not paying taxes. Taxation is theft, and bitcoin enforces rules that prohibit institutionalized theft.

Demand creates supply, not the other way around. This is what drives the price up, to buy liquidity. Supply is really just a function of units in this case, not scalability. 
The coin supply doesn't effect alts at all since coins are divisible. BTC's first mover advantage has given it a competitive advantage in its network effect and resultant security. Bitcoin is the most secure blockchain, because it would be the most expensive to corrupt. This is why alts haven't taken over.

The story just begins there.
Companies who are chartered in the fiat world, in order to realize their profits in fiat, need a currency risk hedge in order to offer Bitcoin-based services. These futures are legitimate hedges in their eyes, and will open the flood gates for big companies to hold large amounts of bitcoin.
If Venmo for example wanted to sell Bitcoin without setting up a whole exchange, they couldn't without these futures because of the risk of Bitcoin crashing. Now, they'll be able to hold, sell, and profit with no risk of bitcoin price instability.

I see it as the reverse, speculators adding to the network effect of bitcoin is adding potential reward for the enterprising individuals who will make it ubiquitous. 
Is it the future of money? Doesn't matter. The more important question is, will the future of money be built on-top of it. Drawing in speculators will make DAO's replace Corporations, Tokens Replacing Shares, and on-chain settlement of off-chain payments. 
What you buy may always be denominated in another currency, but bitcoin will play a part in the back end as a reserve of sorts. Everyone will need it, and thus, bitcoin is like real estate- as it is simply space on a network everyone will need to own a piece of.

Dismantling the entire government would undoubtedly be better, the problem is people are hyperfocused on the relatively few beneficial things government does do. When you make the case against government, the retards say you're against those beneficial things existing at all. Thought experiments on how those things could be dealt with in the absence of government are simply to make the case that the hyperfocus is unwarranted and the strawman just that.
In reality, we'd probably have government-like organizations for roads and sewer and certain territories. It's no different than things like natural gas, if gas companies can run a pipe to every house so to can they run sewer lines. As for the roads those lines generally travel under, roads could have their own NGO who's power is limited to the roads and not other aspects of the economy, and voting/governance of that organization could be tokenized on a blockchain. 
Imagine holding road tokens that represent, for example, 100sqft share of pavement. The Ver's of the world could fork and go living in parking lot.

You can't be a store of value without having intrinsic value. Bitcoin is only realistic to look at as Real Estate rather than as gold. Not everyone needs gold, but we all need real estate to live on... so Bitcoin needs layers upon it in order to make people **need** to adopt it.
Any altcoin can mutably "store value" just as well as bitcoin, thus Bitcoin needs a competitive advantage. Right now, it's network effect.
In order to maintain that leading network effect, Bitcoin needs to compete in other areas, which is why we need the Layer 2 stuff.
BCH can handle simple transactions in the medium term, at the expensive of being able to do a lot of complex transactions long term. That long term needs to come to fruition eventually if it's to be any good at "storing value", otherwise it's just another blockchain no one has use for.

Government could just as easily come out and say everyone needs $1000/hr and to do nothing more than sit in an airconditioned room diddling themself... so why not do that? Oh, thats right, guess how quickly people would starve to death when those poor abused farm workers get in on that deal.

Let's say they used Garzik's company to trace your coins out of CB, to your wallet, then to Gyft or something like that.  They'd have to **prove** they went to your wallet, which they can't because its just digits in the blockchain not tied to your identity. Your deniability is you paid for some Steam games or something.
They would then have to subpoena Gyft to see if an account in your name bought any cards with crypto... they don't have this level of reach.
If they had that kind of reach, which they don't, it's sort of like how the police can't ticket everyone going 5MPH over the speedlimit. It's simply impossible to track everyone's speed all the time.

It's pretty simple actually. If you need a good or a service, you go pay for it, with your own money like a civil person. This is called demand. 
People that want money will then create supply. Using government to steal money from someone to buy something from someone else is just messy, contrary to the good outcomes a free market rooted in sound economics can deliver, and is generally an immoral practice.


It will.


No it doesn't. And it won't be. 


Exactly. This is why Bitcoin kills the government. So we can all live peacefully without thieves stealing from us.
People like you will find out real quick that your ideas suck when you can't steal from people to pay for them.

Technical analysis a glorified gamblers fallacy, you may as well ask a Ouija board what the price will be. Charts have no way of knowing what will move the market going forward.


2 exits over 4+ years, one of which was substantially lower than the entry that preceded it. That's a 50% success rate, a coin flip. The outperformance vs the market is simply because the successful trade was more successful then the failing trade was unsuccessful- with such a small sample we can only prudently attribute this to chance.
One lucky trade over 4 years is not a valid backtest. This is no more advisable than simply holding, particularly for the majority of people who haven't proclivity for the added sophistication.

Crypto will replace all money. Precious metals are cumbersome, and wildly impractical in the digital age. The list of problems with fiat goes on forever. Its utility has changed the world and will continue to do so.
With crypto being secure, frictionless, inexpensive, and anonymous-
 it will all but eliminate governments ability to tax. Governments will fall as they can't be funded and their few prized functions move to blockchains.

With currencies (not to be confused with blockchains), Bitcoin has the killer feature (network effect). Other currencies like Monero/Dash/ZC etc may have other features like better fungibility, speed and so forth. The question is, will they get its network effect before Bitcoin eats the lunch on their features? Unlikely... therefore Bitcoin will likely remain king shit as far as currencies go.
There will be other important blockchains alongside BTC, that serve much different purposes (MAID, PART, and whatever replaces ETH)... but so far other currency-only coins are dead where they stand.

If that's your philosophy for Monero, it too should be for Bitcoin. Bitcoin having utility as a currency is what makes it a viable investment vehicle and store of value, this is why those "investing" in Bitcoin for fiat gains do so for the wrong reasons. Bitcoin is simply better money.
Now, Monero and other alts **currently** do **some** things better than Bitcoin. The question is, will any of those alts make up for what Bitcoin is best at (Network Effect), before Bitcoin eats their lunch (Privacy in the case of Monero).
With things like LN, MAST, RSK, Schnorr, CJ... there's no reason to suspect anything will best Bitcoin purely as a currency before Bitcoin bests them.

States resulting in poor outcomes have nothing to do with geography, its simply due to the fact the state exists. States themselves are monopolies, monopolies result in poor outcomes. States become monopolies through violence, so the existence of said state is inherently a poor outcome. 
To solve the issue of states, an evolution is required, an evolution from republics/democracies to voluntary societies. Just as we evolved from monarchies, we too will evolve away from elected governments.
Blockchain becomes a tool in this evolution, smart contracts can a replace a significant part of the judicial systems role. Bitcoin of course replaces fiat and central banks. Those things being the case, blockchain can't by itself do much of anything politically, but it's a near perfect tool to bring about the obsolescence of politics.

Absolutely, and I agree with your perception. It's a fallacy a lot of newcomers are falling into, but not **entirely** without merit. It's only a fallacy if done for the wrong reasons... which as you say most people are.
If you missed the 10000x or whatever gains that happened with Bitcoin, and want them, you really have no choice but to take fliers on other "cheaper" coins. Even if we agree that Bitcoin will always be  we must admit it's not likely to 10000x again. 
Assuming that Bitcoin remains  and regardless of whether or not it does 10000x again, its still not unreasonable to expect that another blockchain will have some utility and increase tremendously in value from where it sits today. Where people get lost is not understanding why another coin does or does not have that potential. Simply being newer and cheaper is not a feature... it needs to serve a unique function. Most importantly, anyone who says definitively they know which one it'll be are deluding themselves.
I don't think Steemit will go much further than its at now, but you could make a case that it has a place alongside Bitcoin, because it's not competing with it. Same goes for things I do like, like Particl and MaidSafe. If someone is to invest in a basket of these types of things, things that have a place alongside Bitcoin, I think that's a valid strategy because any one of them does have potential to 1000x and not get crushed by Bitcoin improvements. 
Some of these noobies will get lucky because they picked the right new and cheap coin, most will be the greater fool that are holding onto a blockchain that Bitcoin has made obsolete.

Given that hydro and nuclear electricity is vastly cheaper than fossil fuel electricity, it seems it would be counter-productive for the fossil fuel industry. What we've seen is mining concentrating where electricity is cheap, meaning without subsidy, it'll promote green energy. 
It will also ultimately get built into consumer appliances like water heaters for further efficiencies, promoting decentralization all the while eliminating a wasteful banking systems full of offices that are full of commuters and the consumerist behavior inflation promotes.

This, and doing it with fiat is taking you out of the asset you're long as you wait to re-buy. You may end up making money in USD terms, but that could be less than if you simply held onto the BTC.
Better to try it with another crypto, as they're typically denominated in BTC so when BTC rises you don't miss out. You can also do margin on sites like Poloniex and sell something you haven't purchased yet when you know its going to tank. I've made killing shorting shitcoins lately.

The individual investor is important, but as you say likely not swayed by CNBC. I'm specifically referring to institutional money, and you'll note by watching that CNBC is on multiple TV's at pretty much every major location including exchange floors and in the bull pens of brokerage houses.

I actually discussed it casually with my mom a few days ago. My uncle is a relative tech head, for his age, I remember being a wee lad and him helping me install my baller ass 30GB 5400rpm hard drive in the computer I bought with money from my first job. He and I were talking about it on Thanksgiving, and my mom caught it in the news the other day and inquired having overheard us on Thanksgiving.
She's not technical, so I broke it down in what it means for HER. Most people don't care about the tech. I realized this by trying to explain it on a more meta level, and she stated it just sounded to confusing to be practical. I realized then that people need to be aware that, if you can use a basic app on your phone you can use bitcoin day-to-day (obviously we aren't quite there yet from a security standpoint but it won't be long). The same people who never thought they needed anything more than a bag phone in their car 15 years ago live and breath on their tablets and androids. Crypto usability will get there too.
Ease of use issue? soon to be a thing of the past. Here's the issue for us Americans though....
The government controls on FIAT.
The reality is, exchange between BTC and fiat needs to be fluid, and right now it isn't. This isn't a failure of the bitcoin market, its that its so hard to move fiat around. Coinbase is the fastest and most reliable thing we have, and we're still subject to ACH times. Localbitcoins has its place, and a great failsafe, but its not for the mainstream.
One of the talking heads on CNBC capitulated and went to buy some, and reported back on what a bitch it was and how he was unsuccessful (went to Gox).
We've come a long way since April already, with Gox being nearly a SPOF. But we have a long way to go in terms of accessibility.

capital gains are gains over 2+ years IIRC, since its only been a year it would be taxed at income rate. OP, best to reserve 1/3rd of whatever you cash out beyond $1500 for the tax man and make an "estimated" payment of that amount through the IRS website before reporting time so you don't get nicked with any penalties. A 3rd is probably high, but its better to get a return than a bill + fees.

You're right, it's a mistake I won't make again. Every time I've tried to time the market I've failed.

Sounds like a valid reason to cry, to their support though would be best. What 2FA method are you using? I've had no issues with Authy.

so far I've started with 1.9 and turned it into 5.2 with a modified martingale system in roulette. The issue is I'm getting an statistically odd number of repeats, which has forced me to modify further and slow me down.

No. Not open source and you don't control your data. 
DO NOT USE THIS UNLESS YOU TRUST EVERY ONE OF YOUR PASSWORDS TO EMPLOYEES AT SOME RANDOM COMPANY NOT TO BUILD IN A BACKDOOR.

I sold after the run to $200 a week or so ago... boy do I feel like a silly goose.

He also compared a startup selling niche SaaS to local .govs to salesforce.com because they're in the same sector. As a tech professional that was immediate grounds for dismissal. He also covered the company I used to work for, which I personally saved myself from 6 figure losses by dumping my stock when I left shortly after his coverage.

Thanks for responding. Could you provide any insight into the delayed spins? At first I thought it was a glitch with my browser or something to that effect, but its occurred on multiple machines at different locations and at different times. This is probably a larger annoyance than the result of the spin.

be more vague.

not bad... and I've actually made more... have most of it earning on just-dice as an investment.

It did read in Obama's voice for some reason.

I can only imagine, there's something like 80k pages of US code. Reserve amounts would likely be a starting point combined with the slowness between ACH transfers.

I put $3500... I think:
Adoption triples... $3000
Two major profit taking sell-offs... $1500
Noobs loose keys/wallets... $2000
Existing noobs become veterans and up their stake: $3000
$500 thrown in to accommodate for fiat depreciation.
