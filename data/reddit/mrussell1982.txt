The big thing with bitcoin is its decentralized and no one person owns it but isnt lighting network an actual company that has a ceo like a bank? Trying to understand

Plus he there is a good chance he raped a minor.

I have questions will the average person be able to operate a ln hub.  Dont u have to have decent amount of btc for the payments to flow.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:58:36
But i thought the latest thing was that its a store of value.  Not going spend it with the fees now days.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:31:09
Isnt btc basically controlled by blockstream. Backed by bank. No one ever answers this. Still learning

Not really take any 15 year period of the s&amp;p and its never been negative and the 10 year has only 1 such time. Anyone in there late 20s with a 401k is up huge. Easiest way to become a millionaire. And thats where most come from.

Exactly just wait till tether collapses

U take fred to court. Thats what banks do
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:10:01
Its going to go lower once tether collapses in few months
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:38:15
Yeah but 1,800$ gain prolly 400$ of it would go to tax. Still nice 1400 or so gain.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:21:56
Yeah and most 401ks are in mutual funds like s&amp;p 500 not individual stocks
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:34:05
Yeah just wait for tether to implode
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:02:04
Sure u did.

The stock market has ups and downs just like bitcoin but history tells us that my invest in the s&amp;p500 will continue to grow. S&amp;p has never had a 15 year negative return. Most 401ks are for the long  haul. I keep an emergency fund of cash in bank but besides that dont invest in the dollar. Have some crypto as a speculative asset
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:25:05
Never been a negative 15year period for s&amp;p 500 so pretty safe future
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:51:51
I agree thats why only 5% of net worth is in crypto. I know my 401k and other stocks will be worth more in 30 yrs. Never been a 15 year period where s&amp;p was negative. So anyone that  says stocks are gambling doesnt know the market.  Since 2009 up over 400%.

Most in middle class will never experience wealth due to living above their means.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:45:55
I think its more whales. For the last 3 months exchanges have had mass registration but for the last month btc and crypto in general been going down. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:33:42
It may go down but it always goes up over time. We have a 100 years of history. And what do u call the last month of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:59:47
He sounds like a long term investor and stock market is a garunteed return over the next 20 years. Never been a negative 20 yr span or even 15 yr span. In 2012 bitcoin was a gamble. I think the key is to be diversified. Have some in crypto stocks real estate. I really believe in 50 yrs $ will be digital now wether thats btc some other crypto or some government digital $ who knows.

They dont have to answer a usa subpeona. They have created 1 billion since then more like they know its about to burst. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:43:03
Of course but u the s&amp;p500 is a weighted fund.  When u single pick stocks  5 or so for portfolio u rarely beat the s&amp;p500. Plenty studys show it out performs so called expert stock pickers.  U are protected from the downside of 1 stock dragging portfolio down.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:59:34
Prolly bought at 19k though
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:18:52
For the average american the stock market is not a big deal. Most have their money in a 401k and wont be touching it for years. I have a 401k and safe to assume in 25 years will have more than 7x returns roughly. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:54:20
The poor in america are in debt mostly cause they think they need a brand new car and material things and pay for kids college at a private or out of state college or stuxent loan debt. People in general dont know how to manage $. Go to a 2 year community college then 2 years in state public college work summers and save. Live below youre means. I know not every circumstance is the same but car debt in usa is over a trillion. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:55:37
I know the point drop means nothing. Dow loss not even in top 25 ever. Its all about %. And i am not worried about my 401k as much as crypto dropping. Stock market has proven itself over time. Crypto still young and hopefully recovers like it has in the past.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:16:51
In usa more millionaires are created each year from 401k savings than anything else. People just want to become rich and not work for it. I like to be diversified and do have crypto holdings but only 5%. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:20:38
Since 09 s&amp;p is up 400% so dont think going to be so bad if down alittle
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:43:07
Alot of people are convinced one day btc will be the usd of today. I believe digital currency is the future but prolly not for 50 years and prolly be some government currency.
