I think the debate is whether *all* currencies should be deflationary. There are economists who think so. There are also ones who don't. Read Mises *Theory of Money and Credit*. 
Basically a lot of mainstream economic equations are made by simply observing historical data. The problem with this approach is that the equations are not rooted, as any real economic theory should be, in human nature. These equations fit the data until they don't

Savings is good for an economy. On the ground level it's withholding from consumption.

I'm no expert, but logic so far has led me to Austrian economics.

Investing is "good" when it's done with purpose. If you don't have any good ideas it doesn't help that you are throwing money around
Edit: to elaborate, there is only a given amount of humans and resources at a particular time. So whether everyone is investing or only a few people are investing does not make a difference on the amount of total work that can be accomplished. It only affects the signals to what kind of work is prioritized.

It is a good thing. Those mega corporations are probably overfunded because people need somewhere to store value. They pick a basket of popular stocks because "that's what you do". If they don't have any *information* to add, their investment is sending a false signal. That signal results in the company hiring more employees or raising SV salaries. 
If they don't invest, then a smaller amount of dollars are in the economy overall chasing the same amount of goods and services. This is equivalent to them having spent the same investment instead of on tech stock, equally across the entire economy. What's better about not investing is the removal of the false signal

How do we feel about moon-bounce technology? Instead of using the internet, nodes could broadcast their txs and receive current blocks in a way that might be even more censorship resistant because it would not be traceable back to its origin (all signals seem to originate from the moon instead of a local location).
I'm not sure the details, but signals have been sent/received with \[as little 3 milliwatts\]([

You're right to say currency. It's a form of money. But money behaves very different than commodities.

He did say "I could care less about Bitcoin". That means he cares about it.

Unfortunately, in my country, you are required by law to buy a certain amount each year to pay taxes :(
