I remember seeing this exact gif when all the crypto news sites were saying it's going to go from 6500 to 50000 and the people buying for the first time were growing tired of waiting a whole week.  Then it fell to 3500 and stayed there.

second lesson in crypto:
It'll keep falling and then fall some more.  And just when you think you can't handle anymore, it'll fall and you'll sell.  After you no longer have any bitcoin or money to invest, Bitcoin is taking a rocket ship to the moon.

Violent crime is going to 50000 mid-December.  Look at this graph I made that goes straight up.

Imagine if bitcoin could be mined by putting that processing into Folding (research cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, prions, viruses) instead of meaningless and wasteful number crunching.  Wasted opportunity.

The secret to bitcoin.  Buy it, and it will have a record drop.  Hodl for as long as possible.  And when it keeps falling and you can't take it any more, you will sell, and in a few minutes, it'll be at the highest price it's been for years.  We are all in of our own private multiverse and this happens to everyone.

Bitcoin will resort to isolation when all alt coints have died.  Until one day the son of Satoshi comes along and kisses his sister.

I think most Bitcoin holders are too young to realize that people don't have tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in their checking account depreciating due to inflation.

Sorry to hear of your loss.  I can't imagine the magnitude of the grief.
Everyone who invests experiences this to a certain degree.  And only after you invest for a while, you realize the likelihood that you would have held out until it far exceeded your wildest imaginations is zero.  You can't change the past.  You sold because it made sense at the time.  You might as well say you should have bought some stock when it was less than 1% of what it was now because you got investing at that time and you had the money.  But the truth is, it didn't happen and you're talking about changing the past.  It is hard to look at the graphs and daydream of what could have happened though.  We all do this.

any dip is when it goes down a lot.  the problem is you don't know when the dip is going to stop dipping until it has gone up a lot.

Good video, but at this rate, one bitcoin will be worth ~500 trillion dollars in 20 years.  And it'll crash down to 100 trillion dollars?
