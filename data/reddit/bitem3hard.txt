Never heard of bitpay but that sounds stupid not to just use a bitcoin app if they can't do the job. I would love to get tipped in bitcoins at my job.

It's ready now did you even call coinbase or bitpay? Otherwise commenting on something you know nothing about makes you look pretty ignorant. no offense. I suggest as most bars do paying the tip in cash. Problem solved.

Why not just tip the server directly in bitcoins? You can send them to any phone smart or not right?

I can but it's more ideal for servers to get cash until bitcoins become more accepted and they will want cash for at least 1 more generation if bitcoin even makes it that long but if it never even gets out to the mainstream even if only the geeks can appreciate it that's better than doing nothing. Now coinbase and walletbit seem to have worked out the tip software so again it's only a bitpay thing now.

The only issue I see is not from accepting bitcoins at all but the tips which the obvious solution is cash.

I would just let them scan my smartphone's qr code then walk away and leave it up to them to chose how much to bittip me. I guess I could print out qr codes but that seems like a non digital solution and a hassle to keep track.
I will say most people probably would probably just prefer cash for tips and it really helps prior to a lunch break on a budget.

Can't you pay the bill with bitpay then pay the server directly with bitcoin spinner?  I don't like the idea of my boss taking my bitcoins (or cash) then paying me later. I want P2P.

LOL just tip in cash problem solved. You're making up problems that don't exist.
@_date: 2013-05-03 07:18:31
Should exist? I don't think that's really on the merchant as tips are always up to the person giving them to determine how he wants to pay with obvious exception of what the server prefers which will always (for a very long time) be cash.
It's funny you say you want to have bitcoin payment for tips but you know what...no server wants it and those are the very people we're talking about. So respect us hard working servers and give us cash and what we prefer not what you prefer to pay us. You would be lucky for any business to accept bitcoins and here you are bitching about tips. Srsly..

It's not a hassle at all. Bitpay's process is ready easy but it seems most of you have never used it so you have no idea what you're saying.
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:31:48
It works fine. You're overstating an issue? with tips and that is it.
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:29:19
First off why would you tip your server in bitcoins? Just use cash problem solved.
