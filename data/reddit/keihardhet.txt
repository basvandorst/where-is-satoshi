The real life monetary system isn't much different anymore than the crypto world. 
If hackers steal coins, the users pay.
If bankers steal money (even fake, invented money), the users/taxpayers pay again.

- don't let it sit in an exchange, ever (as soon as the trade is done, move whatever funds in whatever form fiat/BTC out of there)
- maybe get a wallet like Ledgerwallet or a paper wallet (one wallet per 1 bitcoin for example). This way, even if there is one wallet ever hacked in some freaky manner, you won't lose all your funds (chance of that happening is extremely small, but it exists, certainly when you sit on it for a long time like 10 years or something, who knows what quantum computing will ever be able to to in cracking it).
Other than that, not much risk of something silly happening. 
- And of course: keep your private keys somewhere safe: not on your smartphone, or any device that's online or in the cloud without heavy encryption. (minilock.io is a good one for example to encrypt your files)  
- Things like magnr.com are also holding your bitcoins and even give you interest on the amount. But it's risky (like an exchange)... can never know if they're still around next week, let along in a few years.  But it's an option, a very safe one as long as the service exists (it takes all the hassle out of holding bitcoins vs. they can go Mt.Gox on you).

Your economic views make no sense here. So if bitcoins fund project 1, they cannot be used for project 2 at the same time. That's normal isn't it? Because 1 satoshi is 1 satoshi, not 2. 
Same with a dollarcent. If you give a dollarcent to project 1, it won't be there for project 2 (however, when project 1 is done, the people behind it, can maybe spend the bitcoin or dollarcent again to another project, or maybe they've spent it on electronics, or wages and that in itself can be invested in any way,... perhaps in project 2, 3 and 4).
The ability to print money in the fiat currency allows you (on the surface of course) to invest in project 1 and 2 at the same time, because they've printed some extra money for you to do so. But the projects both get a devaluated amount of 1 dollarcent each in that case... weakening the economy in general through inflation.
So no matter if there's a finite amount of bitcoin or some extra could be "printed" or "created"... you end up with limited choices that lead to the same conclusion: it's currency, and currency by itself is a means of dividing wealth and transferring it. Bitcoin is in this case no less or more that fiat currency when it comes to funding projects.

All things considered, there might be some other element making people move to anything else than bitcoin. For example, if the electricity consuming mining operations are ever to be deemed 'too polluting' by any sort of government (I speak, somewhere in the future). And they are going to hunt down miners and forcibly close them (just one example, there are tons to be dreamed up). Then people will maybe move to some underground mining platform that uses less power and is not to be easily detected by other forces, or even pre-mined coins or some other system we don't know about yet.
The point is, there are so many variables. The Livra was once the main currency of France, before the Revolution, and it was replaced by becoming totally obsolete because of inflation and power-plays by the new government (who forced people to give land back in exchange for this coin that had only 30% of the face value). 
Something like that might happen when bitcoin gets opposition from big powers. Yet, there is hardly any opposition that physically does anything against crypto in general. That day will come. (I don't hope for it, but I think it's inevitable). When that day comes, the true power of bitcoin will be shown. Because it's more resilient that you'd think. That's the true value of this coin/ledger system (not a currency yet in stick terms).

I agree with you, as someone who just starts out and wants to help out the network, the experience is very bad. 
I don't know how many thousands of people got even put of by installing the default bitcoin client (just as a wallet) and gave up because the 3 weeks it takes in some cases to get the wallet to sync (I know there are ways around this, I know there is electrum and such,... it's just someone who hears about bitcoin, goes to bitcoin.org and gets the first official client to be safe... and then gets a very very louse experience).
All this, while the bitcoin foundation does nothing at all except spending their money and not having a clue.

Maybe use transferwise.com to exchange bitcoin for fiat?
Transferring an amount to a specific registered user (for example a new sort of exchange website, where you need to be member of so people can rate your service and reputation, and all members need to use transferwide too or something). Then trade currency with anyone on Europe/Asia who's willing to trade?
Just thinking aloud here. 
Maybe time for a little experiment ...  
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:35:23
In it for the greed is no good, indeed. But the speculative aspect was also a factor in the price increase and growth/adoption. The speculators need the coin as much as the real users need them, and the users need the speculators and vice versa.

My opinion is, that from the moment there are two coins, they will both collapse to &lt;10$ since the casual user will not know what's going on and the rest will see their investment hit and panic sell like crazy.
Bitcoin has its problems, but splitting it or changing too much right now will hit it beyond repair.

Sell it all now (except for some 10 BTC or so on the side),... put the money in a SCHB or VTI stock ETF and wait 10+ years. He'll have an income for life and you don't have the risk of bitcoin. 
The tech advances that will happen between now and then are too much of a risk to even begin to understand where bitcoin will be by then. 
But you can be reasonably sure they will still be a stock market with these ETFs going strong.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:38:06
No, that's not what I was saying. If we end up with two 'flavours' of bitcoin (for whatever reason) it will.  In this case, it might be for all the good reasons you mentioned, you'll still collapse because the trust is gone.

Explaining bitcoin to small shop owners (even webshop owners sometimes) is hell. They don't trust it, they don't see how they can benefit from it, they don't see how their customers can use it (or basically don't have a high opinion of their own customers) and on top of that: a very poor incentive to start doing anything with bitcoin.
I've tried a few small business owners to start accepting bitcoin after they complained about the enormous costs of the bank-card terminal operator here in my country (there is only one here, and they use their monopoly to ask prices that are downright killing small businesses).
When you explain bitcoin to these owners you get:
- I don't see why this can be as good as free, there must be a catch.
- The volatility, oh the volatility (even when you explain they can convert to fiat as soon as they want after getting incoming bitcoins). 
- Can I avoid taxes with it? (followed by the question on where they can convert bitcoin into 'cash' anonymously. 
- Can my customers get bitcoin? Because my customers are total morons and they wil not 'get it'.
After a while I gave up explaining it. They rather keep paying 23% of their income to these card-terminal mobsters than trying something else. (Not that 100% of their customers would convert to bitcoin, not at all, but even 1% would make a difference in the income of these small shops, who need every euro).
 
My opinion now: 90% of small business owners in my country are lazy, uninformed, old fashioned and too afraid to even do some small investment (apart from the bitcoin debate, some of them were even admitting to be too afraid to have any goods in stock... they are literally sitting in almost empty shops waiting for customers to come in, to tell them "Yeah I can order that product for you, come back next week". 
After which these customers leave, order it themselves online and never return to that dinosaur shop again.
Instead of converting small businesses to bitcoin, I think they should just convert themselves to operational, modern shops first... or wither away like they are doing now most of the time.
The ones that survive will surely accept all kinds of payments, including bitcoin.
For bitcoin to go mainstream, in my opinion: retail must first convert to something more dynamic and performant. That's ongoing right now, so just wait, relax and we'll see where we end up. But don't put your energy in to small businesses (except for the niche markets where some of them really know what they are doing), must of the time they're long dead without even realising it.

The panic I read in your posts, hints at greed combined with impatience. 
You want to make a quick buck, "betting" on bitcoin, while you hope the price will go up considerably after a day.
Look at the price history. Pick at random place, any time in that history.
Then cover the rest with a paper and imagine the line continues and time moves on... you keep moving the covering paper and ask yourself would I have sold here?
With investments or gambles, it's always the same: you almost always buy at the highest point, because that's when this investment gets attention in the media.
If no one talks about bitcoin, and you didn't hear for it for 3 months, then check the price ... and if you want... buy and HOLD. 
Panic selling is always bad, but panic buying is even worse.
Afraid you missed out on this fabulous bitcoin-profit? Well, who knows... you'll always be unhappy because when it's going up you smack yourself for not buying more of it in advance.
And when it goes down, you smack yourself because you were 'stupid' to hold.

When a normal user buys bitcoins, is this impacted by this BIP100 or BIP101 stuff? I guess I'm not alone in having close to no clue on the insides of this blockchain debate (stopped following that a while ago). I'm in favour of higher block sizes than 1MB, but can someone tell me if I need to do something as a normal, casual bitcoin user to choose for the BIP100? Or is this pure on the mining-side of things and is a bitcoin client and a bitcoin unchanged?
Is there a page/wiki somewhere where this is clearly explained for non-insiders?
@_date: 2015-08-24 12:25:23
Don't get me wrong, I'm all in favour or a cryptocurrency, main reason is that I think 'the people' should own money in any shape or form, not some shady governmental institution that prints money whenever it pleases.
On the other hand, I think bitcoin is totally not the place to invest in when markets are declining. When the economy worsens (and I think it will) then the first thing to go is things that are volatile and too high risk. Bitcoin is both (certainly for the common investor, I'm not talking about people who know the technical in and outs of bitcoin very well).
Second, when a crisis deepens, or even evolves into some kind of war-like situation, then bitcoin and the network operation of the bitcoin network will become difficult. I'm sure it will survive, but many, many people will be unable to spend or buy any bitcoins. Compare it to 90% or the ATM machines breaking down or going out of power over night without anyone to repair them or restore power. People will not be able to buy them, nor spend them coins.
Also, the big miners and big players in bitcoin are slowly becoming shady institutions themselves, not really far from what the federal reserve's role is. But there's still time to fix that I guess.

BIP-6 private key, generated at random with dice.
Then put this private key on a BIP6 capable locally downloaded version of a wallet loader on a USB drive then place this on a computer that never goes online or is sandboxed (offline off course). Generate the public key from it and from there, you can load all your coins on there the regular way at once.  
When you ever want to spend the coins, make sure to move them ALL at once from that address. 
No technology involved to store it except for the blockchain itself. 
Keep that private key safe (not on a smartphone, laptop or anything, just an acid-free paper hidden somewhere... I keep mine in these double sleeves for Magic the Gathering cards,... that protects it enough. 
Ledger is a fantastic product, I use it myself, but it's still technology, with a chip and a tech parts. It can fail, be copied or spied upon if they really want.

  If I then swipe the paper wallet with a tool like JAXX or Breadwallet... is there a chance I lose my original value?
I don't want to end up with bitcoins on a chain that are less valuable, in case bitcoin is 100$ and bitcoin BIP148 is 1000$ ... I don't want to hold the original ones of course. How to see that I have the right bitcoins?

And why nog going further and totally brand it as a bitcoin wallet where you generate yubikey-one time keys that can be mapped to a bitcoin address for a limited period of time?

The same capitalists who own the banks, the big corporations and the government are now owning the miners and the industry behind bitcoin.

No surprise that with the adoption of BTC this is going the same way.

I would go in around $70 - $80 - What especially interests me is the knowledge people have about bitcoin. When I enter a shop with a fully automated cashier (the ones where the shop keeper doesn't even handle money, it goes directly into the machine when you pay) I always ask why they didn't use bitcoin too. While you do the investment as a shop to automate the cash register, then you might as well adopt bitcoin in the process. Zero of these shop keepers heard of bitcoin, I mean: zero.

bitquick doesn't really work very well, the third step is impossible to complete, as there is no "valid order" although I selected one

Anyone received this wallet yet? Was supposedly shipped a month ago. Is this for real?

Compare the features of NXT and Bitcoin, and you'll see who's far behind... (BTC in this case is standing still)

You forgot to mention that you can actually scroll down (there is no scroll-bar) in order to see the fourth candidate ... this is blatant vote-manipulation.

thanks for the clarification. Although there are advantages I think for the merchant, like the quickness of payment processing, the independence from certain card providers (and their expensive rates for renting the card readers and such) and of course extra customers (when your competitors don't offer bitcoin payments.  But I see your point that there are also disadvantages. It clears some things out. Here in Europe, credit card processors often ask ridiculous prices from the shopkeepers for even offering the services like paying with VISA or debet bankcard-systems. That's the reason a very large portion of small shops don't even let you pay with any card (even your bank card), let alone credit cards. For these shops there would be a big advantage accepting bitcoin imho.

So in other words:
I have 1 BTC on a paper wallet on june 30 2017:
After the fork (let's say Aug 20 2017 or so) 
I can sell my BTC after swiping the BTC from the paper wallet and transferring it to an exchange
I can cell the same paper wallet's Bitcoin Cash BCH with a compatible wallet and to an exchange supporting it, selling it over there as well 
Is this correct?

Also an idea to take a picture with an older digital camera (non network connected, certainly not with your smartphone!) and then encrypt the resulting image file directly on the SD card. 
The resulting encrypted file can be renamed to anything you know (e.g. birthday123.jpg) while it's in fact an encrypted file. 
that file can be stored on the cloud, or preferrably an own HD or so, if your physical access or passphrase on paper ever is damaged or lost, you at least have some backup of it in encrypted format. 
Of course, this can be brute-forced in theory, or be opened if there would be a big bug in the encryption tool you used. But even then, they have to find your specific file first. (You give up a very minor % of security here, but avoid total loss of your backup seed).
The SD card is best to destroy completely after use, as it will still contain you unencrypted files probably. (I burned mine to be sure)

Seeing the reactions here, it's not something that will be solved in a few days... I'm not going to buy ETH or any other coin, I'm back to fiat currency and I'll wait until something is done about all this mess... somewhere in September maybe. And yes, if BTC is 5000$ by then, so be it. Better pay a higher price for a better coin / network than being in this quicksand-situation at a 'low' price... 
Interesting times.
