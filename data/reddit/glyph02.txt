Why do you say the investigation was not obstructed?
Russia attacked us. Trump is siding with Russia instead of the US.  He also is siding with Saudia Arabia over the US.

The first part said that they could not establish a formal agreement to conspire, but that their investigation was hindered by the actions of the President and others.  The second part laid out those acts of obstruction by the President.  
Go back to the Don Jr. email.  It seems the only reason they didn't charge him with conspiracy there is that they didn't actually get the promised dirt on Hillary.  If they had, it would have been an open and shut conspiracy case.  "If it's what you say, I love it"
How is this okay?

The "othering" of people.  The constant stream of lies and division.
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:20:04
The reason Mueller wasn't able to prove conspiracy (as I understand it) wasn't because Russia didn't do bad things.  They did, and Mueller showed that.  It also wasn't because Trump's team wasn't working with Russia - Mueller showed that too (giving polling data, asking Russia to hack, etc).  
It's that they weren't able to find an explicit agreement between the two parties.  Basically a technicality (as I see it).  
Trump says "Russia - go hack Hillary".  Russia then attacks Hillary.  
Russia says I have dirt.  Trump says "Great. Give it to me"
People cry foul.  Investigation is launched.  Trump obstructs the investigation.
How is this okay?

Not true.  Please see here: 


Where did that conclusion come from?  Mueller basically said the only reason he didn't indict Trump for collusion was the departmental rule that you shouldn't indict a sitting president.  Mueller also said that Trump could be indicted on obstruction the day after he leaves office.

You can't blame Obama for this one.

Primarily I see it to be the manipulation of the voting public through facebook groups, memes, etc.  Getting people riled up, stoking racial bias, and propagating false narratives.
Secondarily seemed to be the Podesta &amp; DNC hacks and subsequent email dump by Wikileaks (and coordinated hype from Trump).
Third would be the compromise of electoral systems.  The story is that "no votes were changed, so it's okay" - but I see this as setting the stage for a second act - likely to play out in 2020.
I await your answer to my question on how you perceive this.
@_date: 2019-07-25 02:06:17
You're ignoring the opinion of the CIA and other government agencies who concluded that Russia interfered in the election and hacked the DNC.
We seem to be at an impass regarding things here.  Allow me to attempt to restate both our sides - let's see if you agree with me here.
You are saying that because Trump has not been charged with a crime he is innocent / exonerated / blameless and therefore has done nothing wrong.
I do not understand your views regarding Russia's attacks upon our country.  Can you help me understand where you stand here?  Do you agree that Russia attacked us as every one (including the FBI, CIA, Trump &amp; Pompeo) says they did?
My position is that regardless of the legal status of particular crimes, the evidence that I have seen (most of which was in broad daylight) shows to me that the President is acting in bad faith and is failing in his duties to defend our country.  He is giving succor to our enemy and attacking basic foundational principles of our country.
@_date: 2019-07-24 17:21:06
I have the same question.  I hope Mueller gets asked that and provides an answer.
You're right - collusion is not a crime.  Do you think it's okay that Russia interfered in our election to benefit Trump and Trump welcomed it?
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:26:05
I appreciate your earnestness, but I don't agree that the list I provided are "opinions."  Each point links to backing evidence/information.  
Immorality:  The "lock her up" chants.  He is advocating for the imprisonment of a political opponent.  It's especially ridiculous since his own family/staff have been doing exactly the same thing (using private emails to communicate about public work).
Also, thumbing his nose at the emoluments clause in the constitution.  Using the office of the presidency to enrich himself.
Racism: Saying that mexicans are rapists &amp; murderers.  "Shithole countries."  Muslim ban.  Birtherism.
I'll add on here - colluding with a foreign power to influence our elections.
Do any of these have traction for you?
@_date: 2019-07-23 17:38:01
Let's rock on with the collusion bit.
Goldstone: "The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.
This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.  This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump "
Don Jr: "Thanks Rob I appreciate that. ... if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer. Could we do a call first thing next week when I am back?"
6 days later, they met in person.
There was an offer of assistance and support by a foreign power (and an adversarial one at that), and an acceptance of that support by Don Jr.  I call this collusion.

I'm not claiming Obama is a paragon of fiscal responsibility, just that Trump isn't either.
Also - morality isn't easy to put a metric on, but Trump is clearly failing America there.

Hang on - you're only guilty after you've been convicted.  We're talking about bringing charges and the evidence Mueller outlined in part 2 of his report.
Let's go back to the question I asked about Russia attacking this great country.  Do you think that Russia attacked our democracy?  That they interfered in our election with the intent of getting Trump elected?

I got a friend interested this weekend.  Walked him through downloading Coinbase and creating his account.  I was going to send him $10 USD in BTC to get him started so he can see how a transaction works.  Except there was over $3 in fees!  Cancelled out of that and sent him $10 in ETH instead.  Fees = $0.20.

Cmon. Each point has citations. You can't find one that has weight with you?

Like national debt?
@_date: 2019-07-25 11:50:22
I see Mueller saying the opposite. He even said yesterday that Trump can be indicted for obstruction after leaving office. He said their investigation was hampered by lies and misleading statements by Trump and others. That Trump directed McGahn to fire Mueller in hopes of ending the investigation. That messages and communications were deleted and not available to the special counsel.
  
Trump has consistently taken Putins word over US intelligence. "he said he didn't meddle, and I believe him". Trump also just vetoed a bipartisan bill to sanction MBS and Saudi.

Let's unpack this a bit.
* Impeachment is being conducted in secrecy.
Impeachment inquiry hearings were conducted in closed door sessions (which is generally what you do when classified information is being shared).  However, members of the Republican party are part of these (and have equal speaking time allotted).  A number of these people were part of the group that "stormed" the hearing - they already had the right to be in there!
* They're basing it on 2nd/3rd hand info.  
The initial whistleblower's claim was based on 2nd hand info.  The inquiry has now received 1st hand testimony (including from a 2nd whistleblower).
* The Russian collusion narrative failed.
I agree, but I'd say that's because others failed and not because it was false. Our media/press failed to adequately describe/explain it to the average American.  It also failed because Mueller failed at his job (He didn't even interview Don Jr!)
* The Ukrainian quid pro quo didn't happen.
The President's Chief of Staff says it did.  So do others directly involved.  They've moved on from denying it happened and are now saying it happened, but doesn't matter.  I think it very much does matter.
I'm going to have a tough time believing anything that Barr comes up with.  He's clearly taken political sides here.
Ninja edits - formatting.

But.... Trump and Russia conspired in plain sight...  
During the campaign, Trump asked Russia publicly to find Hillary's emails.  That night, they launched a new hacking campaign. 
Putin publicly stated that he worked to elect Trump.
You're worried that the intelligence community had detected this (and other connections that are more behind the scene)?  
There's no secret conspiracy to remove Trump from office.  It's a constitutional process called impeachment.
@_date: 2019-10-29 15:13:10
Sorry - what whole thing is going to blow wide open?
@_date: 2019-10-29 18:47:27
Is there an actual transcript?  I thought it was just notes from the call.  Also, please remember that the call didn't happen in isolation.  It took place after many other back channel calls AND the funds being delayed.  Especially knowing that context, "Do me a favor" has much more significant meaning (at least for me).
Evidence is what matters for me.  So far, none has been presented in favor of the President's case.  In fact, it's all been to his detriment.  I'm curious as to what the alleged crime was.
I disagree that the dems are running a "bunch of clowns."  But I feel that's probably a discussion better left to another time...
@_date: 2019-10-29 14:21:34
Okay - I found a wikipedia page on it: [
Seems like yet another load of BS from Trump?  The article is a bit dated though, and I know that Barr was investigating.  Did they find any actual evidence?
