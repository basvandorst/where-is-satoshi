Ah you may be right. I remember reading about this theoretical "feature" of LN, but I don't know the specifics myself. 
My explanation should be regarded as a ELI5 for generic DDoS attacks in this case then.

ddos stands for Distributed Denial of Service, which has nothing to do with hacking or stealing. The best achievement is indeed just temporarily crashing the node / host.
In the most easy example :
It are 50 people that are trying to congratulate you for your birthday, whilst you can only respond to 2 at a time. The other 48 are instead of waiting on their turn, overwhelming you with 'congrats, congrats, congrats' untill you go Knockout due to brain overload.

Your argument that fewer Europeans go to college is provably false (
There is also no standard at all for who gets "free" education. In alot of the European countries schools and colleges do cost money, but simply far less due to the tax systems doing more for (higher) education.
The one thing I do agree with you, is that the top tier universities of the U.S. are unparalleled. Although that are just the top few.
