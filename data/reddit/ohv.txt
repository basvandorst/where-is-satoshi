The analysis should be only when you go to/from XBT/USD, in my opinion.  Its a gray area, because if you spend it after an increase you have realized that increase, but there are ways to perform routine transactions where it appears you have gained but you haven't:
1. You trade, unsuccessfully, and lose half your coin.  Meanwhile the price goes 4x (you're pretty bad at trading and want out!).  In that scenario coinbase says you 2x, when in reality you have exactly the same USD.  
2. I send money to another wallet, then it dips, then I spend some.  Then I send the rest back after it has gone up.  All coincidentally.  Coinbase reports I've gained money, in reality I've lost money just by spending at a bad time.  
A lot of people aren't watching the market every day just to carry out transactions with tax implications in mind.  And, its pretty volatile.
These types of things need to be figured out before this is a viable alternative to mainstream users.

Why?  Can't find one offer within $5 of the current price (say, bitstamp)?   Some range up to 10% high, is this trolling for stupid people?

I don't mean to be all I told you so, it just screamed shadyAF and then it happened to be verified shortly after.  Don't want people thinking a service like that comes with same risk as something more sophisticated (there isn't a sure thing in this game, but there sure is a range of shady)
gray/black market options for those who need anonymity are fine as long as users are aware that it's in the shady part of town for a reason.

nope, immediately available for transfer.  I mean, you have to wait for normal confirmation time if you want to send it to your paper wallet or something.  But they are instantly available.

Coinbase is instant ($100/week, much more after 1 month account) and all I needed to register was my bank acct/routing number.  Its as easy as linking your paypal to a bank.  
If you don't want to do that, you have to jump thru a ton of hoops, choice is yours.
The rest of your points are concerns.

Anonymity is worth something, I guess, if you need it.
I don't think that the OP sees benefit from localbitcoins for what he is doing.  "What is the most legitimate/least sketchy?"  Not some dude on the internet selling you coins at a substantial mark-up.  Definitely not that.  


Right, but the one I compared to was at the time the most expensive of the more common ones.  Bitcoin, like any asset, has multiple "current prices" dictated by the difficulty of dealing with them (compare bitstamp to btc-e right now it's 3% $15/coin difference since btc-e is shadier).  Localbitcoins is more shady, AND more money.

WHY?  why not just use FIFO on USD/XBT transactions with your bank?  
This is a question for people who buy on coinbase and trade elsewhere, then sell on coinbase.  If you buy and spend, maybe this system is appropriate, since you are realizing the difference at time of transfer.
Scenario: I buy one coin then transfer it to a trading platform, trade it during a 2x swing, and transfer my 2 coins back to sell.  Meanwhile since the price has doubled (hence the 2 coins), I'm paying tax as if I 4x my USD (2 coins x 2x price).  When in reality I've only 2x my USD.
Edit:  Whoops.  Rereading that scenario, I guess I did 4x my USD... but the question still stands!

Whoever wants to?  Don't pretend people haven't theorized about those numbers; I'd like to see those, even wild-ass-guesses.  
For me, understanding a system lies at the extremes.  Things click much better when I have understand the range/extent/etc.

48hrs has gone by, still think Localbitcoins is the right exchange?

Thanks! each of those are helpful.
The lost coins is fine as a wild ass guess.  10-20% (my WAG) of the 21 million starts to affect supply significantly.  
I'd imagine more are lost from early on, at pennies/coin, than will be lost going forward.  But people forget passwords and such all the time, it happens.  
I'm just playing with some numbers, its not meant to be concrete analysis.
