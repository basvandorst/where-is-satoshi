Unless people realize that BTC is bloated and too expensive to move anywhere with any efficiency.
Season's changing, there's a new bitcoin in town.

There are coins worth .00000090, and that is on an outrageous spike.
This coin was worth .00000002 less than a year ago, people were selling at .00000002 and buying at .00000001 making 100% profit.
Imagine their faces when it spiked to .00000250

Now more than ever we see attention seeking on an individual level due to social media. How many celebrities were there in the 70's and 80's? How many are there now? How many pseudo-celebrities have emerged on social media with bought likes and bought follows? These days more people than ever want to be famous, and they have access to a much wider audience thanks to social media and the internet. In the 70s and 80s the infrastructure for this kind of attention seeking simply didn't exist, now watch what they will do with it.

So then why all the hype about followers, "friends" and likes? If people don't want to have a big audience then why are there warehouses full of clickfarms that literally make a business of selling people artificial likes, comments and followers.
This is the only time in our history when the layman has access to personalized and manufactured hype at this scale.

Fluid is a dumb name that makes the new generation sound cooler than it is.
Generation Attention Seeking on Social Media sounds more like it.
Or maybe Generation Too Dumb to Use a Real Computer.
Don't ask me why I hate the new generation, I'm just fulfilling my destiny. It's all part of the cycle.
