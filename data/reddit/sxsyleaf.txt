All it takes is a single node that accepts it and the network is still running.
Even if 90% of the nodes disagree with the miners it's still the chain that the miners are creating that will be accepted. 
The current network of miners is what has the power, the protocol exists, the nodes exist and can be copied but the miners can't be copied they are what have the power.
That being said all the users could choose to leave but even then the network could still run.

For users to support a chain it has to be actively mined, in the case of a soft fork that also means that the majority of miners need to be mining it.

It would be stupid because changing the reward is a different level of severity, it's one of the few things that would shatter faith in the network which also reduces price. Changing block size or a feature like segwit would be fine overall.
That doesn't mean that there will never be a concensus and the miners will change the network

You do understand how transactions are confirmed right? they can choose not to confirm transactions and not to accept changes in the protocol. If all miners do this then you either have to move to a new network

they aren't powerless they can still do exactly what they were doing before, secure the network. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:11:03
Those new miners will be a fraction of the hash power and people will migrate to the chain with normal confirmation times(or an altcoin), by the time difficulty would adjust it would be too late.
If 100% of the miners could agree on anything and not change their minds then it would happen.

Once again if all miners make a choice you will have no choice but to comply or leave. Do you not understand this?


So even though we are talking about a situation where **all miners** do something if 5% of hash power held back you are looking at blocks being generated every 3.3 hours and that will continue for up to 3/4 of a year before difficulty adjusts. Even if all users stayed on that network it would be the equivalent of 50kb blocks which is beyond useless, people would move to a different coin.
You need to recognize that even though the miners have a mutually beneficial relationship now that doesn't mean it will always be the case and if there's a situation where they can see that that will benefit with no risk then they will take it. No one is ever going to change the rewards without tanking bitcoin and no miner is stupid enough to do that.

I know exactly how bitcoin works but i don't think you do since you don't understand how the network is secured. If all miners chose to do something then you have no choice to comply or leave.
if even 95% of miners chose to do their own thing it the remaining 5% would be mining a chain that was almost 20x slower. in a soft fork this means that the 95% chain would "win" and be the valid bitcoin implementation and in a hard fork it would mean that the 5% network would take 3.3 hours to confirm a block and on average it would take 4 months before difficulty is adjusted, worst case it would be almost 9 months. that would cripple the network.
If 100% of the miners chose something any alternative would be dead in the water, they would need to gather new hash power to even hope to mine another block.

Do you not understand the severity of this?
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:00:41
The bitcoin network functions based on how the miners agree to run it within the constraints of the bitcoin protocol.  The users can do nothing about that except hope the miners comply with demands.
The miners do have all the power today, there's a symbiotic relationship but in the end it's the miners who control the network.
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:00:40
The miners are what secures the network, aside from the actual protocol they are the most important piece of the bitcoin network.
Edit: Stop and think for a second what happens if the current miners choose to do something, the users have the choice to either leave or follow it. Contrast that to if the users want something, the miners will keep doing what they are doing and the users will leave or follow. no matter what the miners that exist today will create the longest(and therefore valid) chain

We are talking about all the miners here, If all the miners for Bitcoin start to mine something with slightly different rules then it's still bitcoin. For example if the miners choose to activate segwit or whatever it's still bitcoin and there's no alternative.  Like you can either choose to use what the bitcoin miners are saying is good or you can use the nonexistent alternative because at this point if the miners all agree on something no one will be able to come up with enough hash power to continue running the old network.


The users should care because that's the only choice they have.
This is why we decentralized mining is needed, The miners as a whole have complete power over the network and they have to.

The longest chain is bitcoin, that's going to be whatever the miners support.
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:21:27
Because it's not guaranteed to be more profitable. A change to the supply of bitcoin would mean that it's no longer a fixed/predetermined supply. This would result in loss of faith in the network.

the miners have all the power. They secure the network
