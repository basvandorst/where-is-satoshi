Go to coinmarketcap - open the price chart, change the slider below to view only about 3 to 6 months price in 2013. Slide the block forward for the next next 3-6 months and so on. Do it from early 2014 to 2018 and then zoom out..

I seriously do not understand the logic behind buying Bcash.   ver and his tools sold their btc to buy bch at low price and now they want us to buy into BCH so they can have their investment going up ?

People will not spend money in a deflationary situation as they await further reduction of prices (or appreciation of monetary value). This will eventually result in a slowing down of economy and result in bigger problems.

I feel you.. yesterday I was woken up by my wife when I was really enjoying a dream in which I was a millionaire. It hurts when you loose it all in a second..

My understanding is that you just can't reduce the size of the blockchain by reducing the block size. Where will you fit all the transactions? What you need to do is reducing transaction size. This is what segwit did. Now using small blocks are good for faster block propagation where as big blocks, such as 32MB require better hardware. Small blocks means better decentralization as any1 with a pi can run a node.

Salmoney is sound money and you have to do a lot of work to produce it. It is proof of work and anyone can participate.. true decentralization.

You don't have to do anything illegal. They will block you if THEY think your activity is suspicious. Of course you can unblock it.  Just highligting the point that getting comfortable with centralized services is not a good idea.

If the 4hr RSI is above 80,  brace for impact. If it's 90,  you run like your life depend on it.

Dca doesn't work if the price goes only down. But we know for sure that there are peaks which one can take advantage of.

Bitcoin is like cash. So keep it secure just like paper cash. If you accidentally give away your cash no bank can give it back to you. Jpmorgan is launching their own coin, hows that for an impact ?

Paypal can close your account any moment. No one can block you from bitcoin network.

Individual miners who is supporting the core should start pointing their miners to pools that do not support 2X.

Well, one metal has lost its value unexpectedly in the past.  Copy-pasted - As the oft-repeated **story** goes, **Napoleon** III was rumored to have eaten off of the **aluminum** plates while his guests had to make do with ones made of gold..

Take a look at the charts - mainly of number of confirmed daily transactions, mempool size on blockchain dot com or some other site. See where it is headed. Market price is not telling us the whole story.

By looking at the transactions on blockchain. One input and many outputs. You can see that one big BTC amount got sent to many users in one transaction. Check a bittrex transaction on blockexplorer.

The network hash rate of bitcoin is more than 5,658,924,901 GH/s. Its security is at risk only if someone has more than that computing power at their disposal.

Waiting for the usage of mBTC as standard instead of a full BTC at exchanges and price trackers so that people don't freak out on seeing the price..

I suggest you download a wallet client such as electrum on to your computer. Generate an address using it. Then transfer the money to it. Websites are prone to hacking or other types of risks. If you have a local client, you don't have to depend on any website to send or handle the money. Check on bitcoin dot org for some wallets.

Lol..  People are afraid of MtGox coins but they don't realize that each month 54000 bitcoins are being mined..

I had a similar feeling about hardware wallets.. but as soon as I had one trezor in hand and started using it, I removed all those blotted softwallets on my computer.. It is super easy and secure.
