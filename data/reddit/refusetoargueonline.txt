Very quietly. 
Almost as quiet as a totally dead idea.

Price setters. You never studied the free market or economics, this is obvious. Shutting down refineries to slow supply is market manipulation. 
You have no base in this field, you should develop one of you want to discuss it well. "Don't hold strong opinions about things you don't understand." Etc
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:09:24
You should study some finance and economics. Manipulating specifically refers to market makers who are able to artificially influence prices. It's not just supply and demand, which is what's going on when you go get gas. 
If you can't understand the vast difference between buying a tank of unleaded and shutting down refineries, you shouldn't be loud with your opinion. It'll be uninformed.

If an economist or finance guy tells you he can make predictions, run away.

I like that alleged monetary anarchists are attempting to inflict their one currency upon earth. 
"Take your filthy money and fuck off! Use mine, though....yeah, everybody. Huge for business. Thanks, you're making me a ton of money....or you were if money still existed....with 8 billion people use one currency whose supply can't be expanded, won't the dreaded "hyperinflation is coming!" monster cause us huge problems? Can we devalue our currency or switch....Maybe multiple currencies exist because it's a natural equilibrium. Nah. Bring on utopia."

I just learned not to throw out the baby with the bath water. Macro Econ is reliable, micro is a farce.

Who said anything about legality? I see how you're trying to change this argument to something pseudo-libertarian because you lost the original point, but it won't work. 
Market manipulation, price makers and price takers exist. You don't know anything about economics and shouldn't talk about things above your head. You'll sound dumber. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 04:42:33
Brilliant. Since they can't yet predict the dynamical interactions of billions of agents, YOU must be a viable alternative. That's classic.

Jesus. If you're so unable to temper your poor financial decisions that you need to put vast distance between you and your investment documents, if you will, then why the fuck are you playing in finance?

You mean six quintillion. I see no reason that the early adopters of Bitcoin can't rule the universe for thousands of years to come.

I'm imagining being able to hand a dollar to a vendor for a can of diet coke and getting forty cents of change. 
Your method is WAY more simple, so let's get some three or four parties involved in this. I like me some intermediaries. Hey, we'll also flip a coin (Real Coin: not yet trademarked) and if you call it right, somebody steals my money and I get jack shit. 
This simple, effective system you've all come up with is HYPER EFFICIENT compared to this insane store of value that's worked for ten thousand years. Kudos, you guys have solved the problem of making something simple and easy into a shocking skein of failures and loss. Everybody wins.

Kahneman and Tversky studied this stuff 30 years ago. 
Still doesn't make cryptocurrency into a viable option for anything more than criminal activity on a small scale. I'll stick to what is simple and effective.

So you're gambling with your losses? Interesting.

Is there ANY way we can use this to pay for drugs and assassinations? 
If not, I just don't see the use.

Nothing you have ever said or will ever say warrants conspiracy. Nobody is "astroturfing," your comment, it was simply idiotic.

Holy shit, this is the greatest financial advice I've ever heard. 
Where did you get your finance degree, and where in the field are you working?

But by the time the loan needs to be paid, the banker will be on Satoshi's rocketship to heaven. Ergo: 1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin.

And here they're all being proven correct. Good point?

U.S. economy on the brink of what? Another 2-5 years of bull markets? 
You kids are so insane that it just defies any explanation. A bunch of early 20's louts with no finance background dumping all their money and hope into a pyramid scheme. Sorry for your loss, but I'm sure this is all good for Bitcoin.

How many unique posters are even left on this Orwellian horror or a subreddit? It's pretty clear that the interest in this concept has dropped to almost nothing, and the price is just as stagnant. 
I was so close to buying at the beginning of 2013, because a decentralized currency has such potential, but my boss talked me out of it. I would have bought one or two, and I'd have lost 80-90% of that money. My boss owns a wealth management firm, and he went from intrigued to horrified in a few months of Mt Gox type news. 
But I digress....and in doing so, have I sidetracked the argument and now will be banned? Is it even allowed to ban people based on...what, not keeping pace with a discussion? What a tragic and obvious misstep. 
None of this will change the fact that the infrastructure needed for bitcoin is actually centralized in the hands of thieves, and that's the issue. 
Edit: voted down immediately? Lol. The future is bright for this sub. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:57:14
Wtf. 
Lol. So based on your theory, which I'll call "toddler-aged-object-permanence-pricing," the only way value changes is due to inflation and deflation? 
What is the absolute value of your home, then? If the price is inflating and deflating, where do you choose the start point for your value? When it was built? What if you rehab your kitchen by yourself, and your home value goes up? Was that because a certain amount of wood was removed from the market, so supply squeezes pushed up prices? 
This is what happens when you fixate on Austrian economics. Myopically blathering about inflation as the enemy of humanity. 
P.S. sorry for your losses
