IMHO the issue is perception. Since the start Bitcoin is a trust thing. You trust that the algorithm is not going to screw you. If someone forcefully takeover the network, even without a great collateral damage, the trust we will put into it will not be the same.
The bottom-line. If someone wants to damage Bitcoin trust, they have (and will continue to have) the means to do it.

The point is that
1. The cost to reward of "hacking everything" is too high.
Is no longer that big. Just find a zero-day exploit on a couple of the highest yield ASICs and you are set. 
The math is undeniable:
1. You need 20 BitFury to override 1 HashBlaster "I" – 20nm
2. You need 1692 Radeon 7970x3  to override 1 HashBlaster "I" – 20nm
3. You need 3837 ZTEX USB-FPGA Module 1.15y to override 1 HashBlaster "I" – 20nm
And we can continue. It is a ratios game. The higher the hashes needed the more important a single provider gets.
Remember that such an abuse can kill bitcoin. It is a trust issue.

Its great you are so sure, I am not. As the jury is still out on that one. I am more in a neutral position.

Cryptocurrencies are a very good thing. However, you can easily build a DDos taking control of 2 or 3 manufacturers. Even the difference between single manufacturers can cause it, when miners go in flocks to the new hardware. 
1. Everything can be hacked. We move to a different manufacturer, it can be hacked too. Unless you are mining without a network connection, it is difficult to escape.
2. They can be undetected if used properly. Lets say Amazon starts accepting Bitcoins, the one in control may attack a single target just diverting the computation to other blocks. Causing Amazon's to be delayed as he wish.
3. Even a single hour attack, can create a panic and dump event. (Just make sure to buy at the moment it happens).

Maybe, but depending on the motive. There is certainly lots of people interested in bitcoin to succeed (I am). However, there are others that are losing money (banks, governments, etc) because of it. 
The incentive is there, we just dont have to blindly believe it wont be worth.

The point is that they are not going to be invalid. The bitcoin paper states specifically that a 50% + 1 attack is one of the biggest issues of Bitcoin. There have been mitigation steps with checkpoints, and it is true the difficulty to revert operations back in time is big (the cost is exponential). 
However, there are interesting things you can still do when you control the 51% of the network. Like DDOS a particular merchant public address, and as an ASIC user you wont see any difference (only the merchant will feel the heat).

Great then, as a fellow computer science guy we can agree to disagree with subject matter knowledge on both sides. 
Luckily I am more in the building stuff. If I were on the black hat side and were sponsored by someone with stake on attacking bitcoin (like a government); There is where I would start looking for an attack vector.

You are worried about centralization of pools? Hardware centralization is far worse. :)
