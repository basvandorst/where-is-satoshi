Thanks for the response. I never really thought bitcoin would get that huge (perhaps I did not convey this well enough in my post) since it really seems like a crazy notion. But the thing is so many people with that "too the moon" stuff are on a hype train, and then some people say bitcoin will die tomorrow so I wanted to see someone who liked bitcoin but wasn't planning on topping Bill Gates because of it. 
The data center point due to the Blockchain size was a good one I actually didn't think about. 
Either way thanks and good stuff.

I agree witch is what makes me wonder where do people expect bitcoin to go? I'll edit my main post to include this question. Thanks for the input!

Thats why I asked. Explanation is good

Not really. People can spend bitcoins and buy more as they please. Just imagine though if Bill Gates tried to convert all his money to bitcoins.... there wouldn't be enough bitcoin even if we all sold ours to him (current market value), thus meaning bitcoin price would have to rise. So this "theory" is just saying if bitcoin becomes accepted enough, will its price have to go INSANELY high to meet with spendable wealth of the world.

Right, we stated the same thing. So the question is: Where does it have the potential to go to and why?

I am in the US. I have read some stuff about coinbase. Someone said they are more expensive, but if its the easiest then maybe thats the way. Would you recommend waiting or trying to buy now?
