Omg I love that.  I seriously seriously love that piece of artwork.  Any info on the public auction format or am I too late?

LOL!!!! Thanks for the heads up.  I got my coins out of there via UNO, chatted about it for a bit and then too was banned.  They are going insolvent.  Nuff said.  The writing is on the wall.  A few shills/trolls(?) are in there saying stuff like "they are the oldest, tried and true" etc.  Then I compared what they were saying to what people were saying about Gox back in the day... BANNED.
At least coins are in hand :DDD

Avoid, avoid, AVOID.  The site is run by crooks... either by crooks or people who are completely/purposefully inept.  Their business model essentially is to loan out other people's btc and charge ~4% to borrowers.  However there is no risk to the site as their model does not depend on repayments-- the ~4% comes right off the top and the rest is disbursed in the loan to the borrower.  (Please correct me if I'm wrong as they may have changed this).  But essentially they are brokering loans with btc that they are not responsible for and have little means to enforce any type of collections on behalf of the original coin holders.  Their model is just like the mortgage brokers back in '08 who didn't give two shits if people could afford houses or not since it wasn't their money that was being loaned.
Again, if you're wise you will AVOID.  I haven't had much experience with BitLendingClub (now LoanBase) or BTCPOP.co but I hear good things about the latter.
