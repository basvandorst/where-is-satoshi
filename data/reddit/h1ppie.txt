if they process 50k transactions a day, and .01% have a problem, that's 5 problems a day to fix.  No clue what their transaction numbers are, but that seems like a high(ly made up) error rate.

will you allow the node to be used for a TOR transit or exit node?

right on, thanks!

Your answer to the existing government assisted monopoly is to remove the regulations that are keeping the monopoly from getting worse?  How about we address the cause of the monopoly and allow more ISPs to have access to existing, taxpayer funded infrastructure.

The government has also granted a monopoly to cable and phone companies because it's not reasonable for every ISP to get an agreement to use all the individual pieces of property needed to deliver cable, phone, and internet service.  This is similar to other utilities like water and electricity.  Internet service is becoming an essential service, just like water and electricity and should be managed in a similar manner.
If companies want to give up their monopoly status and allow other companies to use this common resource, then I am fine with them ~~charting~~ charging whatever they want because they will quickly face a mass ~~executed~~ exodus of users moving to better services.  If they want to be a monopoly, then they need to be regulated.

thanks for you hard work!

you're paying for the internet, but don't have access to configure the router?

I'll gladly pay you Tuesday, for a hamburger today

yay, Tuesday!

So you put a disclaimer on it that says "Redeemable until $some.date.in.the.future".  after that date you recycle the funds.

Nice site, I like that it has instructions for multiple operating systems.  You can also get the OUI (Organization Unique Identifier) data straight from the source, [IEEE](

A place in line is up to $250 now.  Can't you see how hot this project is? ;-)
According to the project page, getting one of the 100 pre-release machines in December is $2500.  If there were some power numbers, that might be interesting.
There would also have to be some possible chance of that hardware shipping in 3 months, which is unlikely.  Some random guy with no credentials or history in hardware design or production is going to do in 3 months what established companies couldn't do in a year?  Right, sure. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

Ummm, ok.  What is  your expected power usage?  That seems to be as important, if not more, then the raw hashing rate.


So, buy a place in line to buy this hardware, 4 months from now, that isn't past the mock up stage?  BFL thought they were going to ship hardware 6 months after they started work on it, and they were already in the chip design business.  We saw how well that worked.


Oh, there is really going to be some hardware ready in December.  If the power usage is reasonable, that's a great price for 400 GH/s.
Let's take a look at the what other projects the Creator of this project has started and delivered on.  It won't take long, there's only [one]( ).


Raised a total of $7, with a goal of $80k, Sooooo close.  Someone should have told this guy about the NSFW alternate usage of the term "rim".  Or, maybe he already knew it.  


Oh, I see.  Give us all your money, and *if* we get to the point of shipping a product, you will get to jump to the head of the line.  If we *don't* get to the point of shipping a product, we appreciate your letting us keep the money any way.

Good point.  I wasn't thinking of this use case.  All the more reason to figure out how to spoof your MAC to one from a common manufacturer.
You could use a random MAC that doesn't match with anything assigned by IEEE, but that would just make you stand out, when you probably are trying to blend in.

After you go the the steps on the "Getting Started" page, you will get a customer ID.  To make a payment to that customer ID with BTC, go to Account &gt; Subscription management &gt; Bitcoin.  Put in the customer id, and it will generate a BTC address specific to that account to which you can send your BTC.
You should not need to put the account number in the note.

The MAC address doesn't go anywhere beyond the local network, UNLESS some other higher level program is sending it, think of you web browser sending the amount of installed memory, operating system version, free disk space.  It's not required for the communication to proceed, but stupid programmers are stupid.
The MAC address is also easily changed in software, so no need for a separate computer to try hiding it.
