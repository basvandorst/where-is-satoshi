This is Corey from BitPay.
Thanks for posting the transaction.
We are currently researching this now.
I will personally make sure that you are made whole as quickly as I can.
@_date: 2016-04-25 23:45:45
OK, here is the latest update.
Code ready to deploy to address an issue that impacted a small group of customers.
Since it is getting late @ BitPay and Valve we are waiting until tomorrow to re-launch...
This is so we can closely monitor the transactions and make sure things are going nice and smooth for everyone.
Thanks for your patience and this thread will be the first to know when we are ready for the next round of transactions.
Any of the customers impacted will be taken care of... feel free to MSG me if you need me to research a transaction or anything.... I am happy to help.

Explaining it like this works well: " Take a block of gold, cut it into 8 individual slices that weigh exactly the same. Would we both agree that each of those slices have the same value?" ( when they say yes, say ) "Just as gold is weighted/priced by the ounce, a single Bitcoin is weighted/priced by the decimal point." (Then tell them that a Bitcoin has 8 decimal points, give them the current exchange rate and tell them it is the value of 1 BTC... Next, tell them they can even buy .5 at 1/2 the exchange rate and start moving over a decimal place (.05) and tell them they can buy at that price (repeat moving decimal to right and telling them the value, at that measurement) until they have their ahhhhh Ha! moment. 
I found that this works 100% of the time. 😜 
The gold parallel sets the stage to explain mining (if they care). It also allows them to understand how sustainable Bitcoin is (regardless of the value) for a global marketplace even with a limited supply in circulation. Easy as pie!
As soon as people see it with parallels to things they understand. They can get their mind blown when they independently research it (on their own) like all of us have/do.
Plant seed, watch grow, start a forest fire!

Buyer Beware: Their web wallet goes down all the time and says NO BALANCE - when you actually have one (Does that scare you enough?), Chrome browser support is non existent. Technical Support does not address issues and ignores their customers. 
There are no stable versions of desktop wallets that support the device and everyone keeps saying "soon" (What does that even mean anymore with Bitcoin Companies/Dev efforts?)... Who want's to trust real money with BETA deliverables? 
This is a hefty dose of the truth... you have been officially warned. 
It's time for ALL businesses in Bitcoin to...own up to their issues, take responsibility for their actions, grow up and put on BIG BOY PANTS or the experiment fails or even worse... we beg for regulators to want to mess with utopia because companies can't get their shit together... This does Satoshi's idea a major injustice.... and is sad. Professionals rise up, amateurs please sit down.
I purchased two of these crappy little things.. so I at least know what I am talking about. Did SatoshiLabs pay for a favorable article to be written or did the author @ Coindesk just get really lucky when he used it the device to get pictures and content for his article?

This is a really good life lesson in disguise...
People aren't going to always agree with you. 
The irony of her response is that all technologies that change life as we know it...get scoffed at (by the dumb masses) at first. You should watch some early interviews with Gates and Jobs on TV with people laughing at their visions on how applicable the PC and the Internet would be for society. Your son is a pioneer and visionary at the very same calibre as those dudes.
She should have been smart enough to know better. Sad. I feel sorry for her. She sounds miserable and under qualified for her job. It sucks to be that person.
To crush a kids spirit is wrong, not cool and it's awesome you are dealing with it constructively. I can't really say I would have done as well as you with this ordeal (that's  one good reason my wife and I... homeskoo ours... I guess?).
You watch...It's going to have a very positive ending. 
Tell your son we ALL respect him (and you as well dad)!

Corey with BitPay here. I have sent you a message with my contact info. Our Payout API is an Enterprise grade solution with unbeatable pricing.
BitPay has the functionality that you are looking for and is the most scalable option you will find in the industry. 
It's exciting to see your interest in Bitcoin as a payout method. We applaud your vision and spirit of innovation. We want to see you successful and would love to partner with you.
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:21:15
Its not an issue of incompatibility. 
ADP + BitPay = mucho compatible
ADP simply has not integrated with the Bitpay Payroll API as of yet! ;)
Getting bitcoin needs to be easy &amp; getting it in payroll makes the most sense!
@_date: 2014-10-20 16:23:27
Yes, much FUD &amp; that is how things get changed sometimes (if the vendor really cares). 
I am pointing out that the product is a good idea... however -- the implementation is not ready for mass consumption (just yet). As stated before, If there are desktop wallets that support it that are NOT just in Beta... 
I will give it another shot... but in the meantime, Why should we allow people (friends and family) to buy these devices and realize the same thing/problems we are having? Satoshi Labs needs to address it and quit ignoring the issues. It's their responsibility.
I will try it again if/when the desktop wallets arrive out of BETA.. Until then, the myTrezor site is not reliable enough to depend on for regular tran usage. 
Personally, I have witnessed 4 instances that the site was down or said no balance on an address that I sent 10+ BTC to...(spanned over the last couple of months) frankly, that is an uptime ratio that I DO NOT want to lock up a decent amount of BTC over...&amp; gets scares that I have 0 BTC (intermittently) ... when  I need to transact out of my Trezor holdings. Who wants that? To have to feverishly look up on the blockchain to see what the "real" balance is...when that particular issue arrises...and still have no way to spend the funds until myTrezor comes back online... and/or you have to go find another less secure wallet to port a 24 word recovery seed that supports the same encryption as Trezor into.... is 100% an unacceptable answer.  Do you like that experience? I don't.
SatoshiLabs has even said the issue was fixed multiple times already... and it continually re-manifests (for more than 8+ hours at a time). This is a financial instrument NOT a plastic play toy. If companies play in a financial space building financial products... that kind of business.... requires a "to the satoshi" level accountability and a 99.9% uptime/reliability. 
How can I be my own bank... when I can't verify my balance and send payments when I need to? 
I don't know about you... but, People expect consistency with their money not Uncertainly... The Fear and Doubt parts come into play... when you have to look on the blockchain to see if the money is even there or not. Soooooooo, there's the source of your "FUD" claim.. and yes, It's is unashamedly that... a big pile of smelly FUD... until it get's fixed (If it ever get's fixed).
Love the hardware concept (obviously, ahead of it's time)... 
But, I don't trust their web site for obvious reasons...plain and simple...
it produces way to much FUD to be worth the time of playing with it.
On 10/20/15,  I will give you my 2 Trezors if NO Desktop Wallets support it (out of BETA).
@_date: 2014-08-08 23:16:26
Corey @ BitPay here. The good news is. 
We have a growing list of providers using our Payroll API ( each specializing in distinct areas of serving employers and even individuals. )
Payroll/HR is a very diverse market with no one size fits all option(s).
We are working hard to add partners that fill in ALL the gaps.
Helping more people get bitcoin easily is VERY important to us.
Send me a MSG with your contact info and I can pinpoint a solution that will work for you 
regardless if your employer is keen on bitcoin or not just yet!
In closing, if they are keen -  SPLENDID! - I am here to help show them a couple of ways!
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:40:15
There are several payroll options coming to market (as we speak) that help employers provide the service - as well as options for individuals that work for employers that aren't bitcoin savvy/ready yet. 
Payroll/HR needs are very specific to the organization needing them.
The good news is, the infrastructure is being built upon...
Multiple options being avail for the market = very good for Bitcoin!.
@_date: 2014-10-19 03:00:29
I purchased 2 of these devices and stopped using both of them because the problem mentioned in this thread is encountered with increasing frequency when needing to send BTC to someone for payment. It's a bit unnerving and scary to not have access to your funds when needed (even intermittently).
Soooooooo, I stand in wait... hoping that Electrum and MultiBit eventually release a stable version that support the Trezor...otherwise the Trezor is just a toy to play with when accompanied by myTrezor.com. 
I expect to see an influx of complaints since Coindesk has finally wrote a favorable article on the device (and people will buy it as a secure solution to store keys).... If SatoshiLabs and BitsOfProof don't start taking the web interface seriously, it's going to rear it's ugly head on them. 
The Chrome extension being inoperable is another huge problem for people... The lack of a support forum and community to share info is also a bit of a pain... I like reddit and all.. but to have to dig to see what issues others are having to figure out your own... is just plain retarded.
The concept behind the device is awesome and potentially reassuring for users from a peace of mind perspective... if they could get their act together and more importantly....desktop wallets start really supporting the device to get us less dependent on that crappy web site ( 
I agree with the below comment that says its amateur the way it stands.... but I still remain cautiously optimistic that they will get it all sorted out and it will be more dependable one fine day. To say it's not a Trezor issue is laughable. It is 100% their issue, if they are serious about customer service and their product in a long term strategy. If it's a product pump and dump... it will remain as is... or progressively get worse.  I guess time will tell?
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:57:53
I get a portion of my salary in bitcoin using the BitPay Payroll API. 
It's simply an after-tax deduction and much cleaner than messing around with exchanges and giving up my bank account info.
Who are you gonna trust? 
You are gonna trust the people that pay your paycheck reliably.

I don't think its up to them entirely. It's up to their vendor they purpose their digital cards from. Hence Walmart cards being no longer... My guess is, that was not their decision to pull a popular product.

Corey @ Bitpay here, We have a series of partners that we are in the process of integrating with our Payroll API (one is bound to be a good fit for you). 
Send me a msg with your contact details and I will be happy to contact  you to speak about the various options. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 20:47:22
There are multiple ways outside of your current ADP integration that give you (and others in your company) options to acquire BTC on payroll despite it still being the cleanest to get it from ADP (in the interim). Be encouraged that there are viable options out there beyond exchanges that can serve you that won't cause you to have to dump ADP. :)
Send me your contact info and we can discuss multiple options (&amp; pick the ones that make the most sense for you and/or your company). 
I am here to help EVERYONE get bitcoin on their paychecks. 
I get it on mine and LOVE IT that way!
@_date: 2014-11-20 07:48:24
I would love to have a conversation with you about your needs. I will send you my contact info via a msg and we can chat about your needs sometime later today. 
Just so you know, Many payroll providers use our APIs to provide Bitcoin payouts in many interesting and creative ways. We cover many payroll provider, employer and employee/individual use cases internationally and domestically.
We have many useful options available in our 'Bitcoin Toolkit' to architect and implement a winning solution if your needs are determined to be unique. 
Payroll is hardly a one size fits all scenerio... Especially with international remittance thrown in the mix. @ BitPay, We pay international employees in fiat as well as Bitcoin (on three continents) and totally understand the challenges and expenses involved. Bitcoin is by far the cheapest option when sent to international markets with reasonable liquidity. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:04:04
Yea, that's the tricky thing about bitcoin... It's up to the people to make it work. 
As more people have the opportunity to get it in payroll, more people that don't get it that way... will ask for it. 
It takes time, and now that providers are coming into the market to fill the gaps... is very encouraging to see!
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:01:48
Idea 4u: Start your own meetup with peers that you vibe with. Invite speakers that have the expertise you are looking to learn from. Inspire each other. Learn together. Discuss potential applications of the technology. Start small &amp; dream big!
Use google hangouts or skype for speakers that are not in your area.  
There are many smart people in this space that would not mind giving up an hour of their time to speak to your group over the interwebs. 
Record it, post it on youtube and help others.
Bitcoin is for everybody!
It's way cool your interested in it. 
Don't get discouraged. 
Be encouraged. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 01:36:05
We are integrated into multiple providers that have options for most of the use cases (each use the BitPay API for their underlying payout technology).
Here are the categories they fall in:
A) Innovative Payroll/HR companies that integrate bitcoin for their employers. 
B) Employers that need an external option to offer BTC to employees because {A} has not happened yet and they are eager to please their staff.
C) Employees that are sad because {A} and {B} don't apply to them just yet.
Send me a MSG with your contact info and I am happy to chat about the best options for you. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 00:01:41
We provide payout services to many payroll providers that use our API. How many employees do you need to pay? I can hook you up with one of our payroll providers. Email details to corey and I will make the introductions.
@_date: 2014-09-14 03:06:44
It's a good question... But the obvious answer is because consumers are the precursor to businesses.
@_date: 2014-08-10 15:16:32
Do you have a close up pic of the other side of the card?
If so, that would be helpful.
@_date: 2014-10-19 17:50:00
yea, such a great idea and poor execution. Typical, Bitcoin companies ran by developers... missing QA prowess and business acumen.
@_date: 2014-11-01 02:19:34
I bet all the magnetic striped cards would have to be replaced as well once communications came back online. I guess we would go back to sea shells for a period of time to let the chaos sort itself out?

@_date: 2014-08-09 04:06:02
Hmmmmmm? Corey @ Bitpay here...Use the BitPay Payroll API to build out the ability to manage all those payouts. If you are interested in that as a potential project... MSG me with your contact info and I can help you out.
@_date: 2014-12-11 11:37:00
Just because someone worked at JP Morgan, does not make them an enemy of Bitcoin. Payments people from all over need to move into the space and go thru the process of being unraveled and undone by what the Bitcoin protocol is really about. How else do haters learn to love and people influence others to contribute to a very relevant experiment?
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:46:14
This version of the application was in beta and only 2 days old. It also was in debug mode (and that attributed to the speed a bit) We have since made a ton of updates on the usability and responsiveness and it is much better. 
Our UX team will be watching cashiers at the Georgia tech football game tonite to gain more intel on how to make it even better. Thanks for the input. It helps and we will learn from it and incorporate when applicable. BTW - the beeps are now on the list of things we want to achieve next (thanks to you - with an on/off switch for sounds). 
Thanks again... We appreciate you.

This particular app was in beta at the time of the filming. It was also in debug mode at the same time (making it slower) It's much faster now and it does have a gratuity mode, it was just not enabled at the time  of this demo.

Create a Bitpay merchant account @  Use the client billing feature. It's intuitive and simple. Basically, It will email the client based off your preferences... the client pays the invoice with Bitcoin ... &amp; to get your money (however you want) ...You can adjust your daily settlement preferences to settle in any percentage of your local currency and/or Bitcoin. Works well in these types of use cases.

Finally got around to testing the latest version with one of my Trezor HD wallets. Worked great! I love that I can use it in "watch only" mode (with it unplugged) and spend after I (plug it in and) authenticate. It feels good to know there is a solid alternative to the MyTrezor site.  The only thing that I would change is... Throw up a dialog window to tell the user to plug in the Trezor when the send tab is accessed when the device is unplugged (to make the UX a bit cleaner). Great work guys! Keep up the good work... You're appreciated... Be encouraged!
@_date: 2015-01-06 23:01:56
I think that if they come back online and r/bitcoin and bitcointalk is not bombarded with "OMG where is my bitcoin?" posts... we will stabilize and things will chill. The overall perception is BitStamp are the good guys and will do the right thing to make customers whole. They have a bit of a challenge to overcome... and can make it positive --- if handled correctly and with integrity. Have your popcorn ready and get a good seat folks, we will see soon enough.

Right On! Very cool dude. Excellent stuff. 
I am not the only crazy one around here....yay!
The things you can get them involved in is amazing and as far as the imagination can go. We had one kid learning two languages, two instruments, fencing and hockey at the same exact time.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
That was bordeline child abuse...in hindsight....but he kinda wanted to do it all.
On a more relevant note...My youngest is getting into bitcoin hardcore...
he gets paid allowance in it and transacts for various stuffs of importance to him.
It's a proud daddy moment since I kinda participate in the space 8 hours a day.

***This might be a helpful tl;dr perspective for someone ***
We home-schooled both of our kids thru their elementary/middle and high school years... 
We took fragments from the unschooling approach and built a custom ever-changing curriculum for them.
It works if you are dedicated to rounding out their
educational gaps as you learn their gravitational interests,leanings and strengths.
The "system" doesn't , can't and won't be able to pay attention to the details to give them what they ultimately need without letting many others fall from the wayside. 
We couldn't risk our kids to be that kind of statistic and did not trust "the system" to shape them. 
Soooooooo many brilliant kids never are recognized or given a chance because they may not have the type of personality that jives with the educator or they look or act different from the rest of the herd. &lt;-- that is an important lesson to learn (in and of itself) as well... I get that.
Our oldest has a 4.0 GPA in college and started as a Sophomore out of the gate. 
He currently lives on campus, is well rounded, has already traveled 4 continents, has had access to many experiences that have given him a "unique edge", is incredibly mature (for only being 18), is a born leader and has a pretty interesting take on life thru his very own lens.  
He's still gonna make some stupid mistakes (along the way) and will continue to learn from each of them. That's life.
Some kids don't need a "common curriculum" as much as others.... 
while some kids thrive off the regiment.
Parents need to spend enough time with their kids to know what they need
and STOP AT NOTHING to make sure they are getting it. It requires constant creativity. 
Public School's aren't horrible (serve a key purpose in society)... 
they are simply not required for everyone to be "OK/Happy" and/or productive.
Believe me, there have been MANY times where it seemed like putting them in "traditional school" was 
a "better" option... especially when second guessing our ability to teach them... being poor as dirt sometimes
and being fearful we could be screwing em' up. BA HA HA HA HA HA HA!
In the end, we found the key is having a network of others for interaction and 
encourage the sharing/contribution of free flowing ideas/concepts to inspire one another.
Life-long/Long-term friends &amp; relationships make most humans confident, teach them the stuff that matters and makes them happy.
It's a major commitment, I applaud anyone who takes the sacrifice to raise, educate and takes responsibility for their kids.... I certainly wish I could have been raised more that way... but, my folks couldn't have done it with so many mouths to feed. They did the best they could.
We think of our 2 human resources as perpetual guinea pigs.
They stay alive and prosper... if you just simply give a shit about them, give them water, sunshine, food and try more often than not to prefer them over yourself.
In closing, What does a child learn from having to stand in single-file lines multiple times per day Monday thru Friday anyways?

Who knows dude?? you may have inspired some rich &lt;money bags&gt; person to do this... When that happens, I will come back and send you a tip... since you are the real pioneer in my book (and deserve some credit for birthing the idea into existence). ;) Any Promo for Bitcoin is good promo...in the end.

print them in limited supply with cute puppies, kittens and woodland creatures to circumvent the appearance of it looking like money (Beanie Babies 2.0).

Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Get Jordan Belfort to do the sales pitch... If your going to do a sketchy infomercial... you might as well do might as well have "The Wolf of Wall Street" involved... to make everyone want to buy in on the hyped up action. The hardest part is getting a legit real-time price ticker to show on the screen (showing the price goto the moon - hopefully) to accompany the countdown time-clock for the show... to create a buying sense of urgency.

Yes. It's called ADD/ADHD.

I don't disagree with you (pardon my sarcasm in the post). It is just... 2am seems to be a shady time for TV in general. The freaks come out at night. Mix it up...Go for the prime-time spot (if financially feasible)!
@_date: 2015-03-27 15:38:05
So funny, I was thinking the same exact thing. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:57:27
Yes! I would give it a try and keep more bitcoin holdings if it worked efficiently.
@_date: 2015-10-23 16:11:10
I Agree. I could have chosen better words. It's just important that's all. 
Will it be bitcoin alone or some other combined technologies to get to a scale [to handle all the inputs] needed for the entire worlds traffic...in the future or not? 
Thoughts? 
Will bitcoin just be a very efficient global settlement network that blows away the speed of an ACH? -- All options are still great and revolutionary. Opinions on that? 
@_date: 2015-10-23 16:14:53
I am fully engaged and happy to chat with folks about stuff... Let's just be productive and encouraging of one another...help each other in our path to build cool stuff together... is that too much to ask?
@_date: 2015-10-23 17:00:20
Yeah. it's all good man.
I see your points...
I love it that you care this much.
You are gonna make me research all weekend now.
Gee thanks. J/K
I am a payments guy - that is my angle.
Bitcoin as a payments rail - Money from sent from Y to Z.
20+ years in that game - 
I have lot's to learn still.
I still love every second of it... and innovating there.
Names Corey... nice to meet you.

"I don't intend to feed the Bitcoin Reddit trolling thing going on here...
I just love payments and want to see Bitcoin succeed (and it will)." - they guy being discussed
For the record i only said:  yup. really wish we would just do something drastic for it to scale to VISA tran processing levels. 
I did not intentionally take the name of DECENTRALIZATION in vain. Forgive me.

touche' nice one. [upvote]
@_date: 2015-10-23 16:13:54
Again. I could have worded it better... but it's 140 ish characters... give a guy a break.. ok? lol 
'Drastic' is a word that scares people I guess??? 
I think...little by little is also a very effective approach to things (when applicable). 
One thing is for sure, It will sort itself out in the wash.
Decentralization is great and very important to innovation/creativity...
Let's just not make it a religion...shall we?

Bitcoin is prepaid cash for the internet.
@_date: 2016-05-03 00:26:40
ha ha ha ha, I thought the same thing.
@_date: 2015-10-23 16:15:49
You will find I am not a disagreeable person by nature, willing to change my perceptions [and try to not be prideful]. It's a horrible place to be stuck in a non-pliable mindset. Let's talk. I am here listening.
@_date: 2015-10-23 18:13:17
Nope. that is not the motivation... but, thanks for playing. The motivation is building things that are useful with/for folks.

Who knows? Probably Alien intervention.
When that Greek dude (with the hair) on Ancient Aliens starts saying the protocol is Alien Tech.... To the Moon!

I asked Circle Support about a .csv export for taxes today and received this response:
"We are currently developing a feature for our customers to export a .csv file from their account for tax reporting purposes. You can expect it to be released within the next few weeks - we will notify you when it is live." 
I hope this helps.
@_date: 2015-10-23 17:05:56
OMG - that is sooooo funny... we do do that... don't we? Even our whitepapers suck as bad as our tweets sometimes. Ha ha ha ha ha!
@_date: 2015-02-13 07:01:12
No problem at all - It just finished. 
It was very high level content wise... 
It still was way cool and historic that millions of (tin foil hat wearing) folks got to hear about BTC for a whole hour live on nationally syndicated radio. ;)
