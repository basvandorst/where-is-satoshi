I find it really difficult to think that some nasty guys are chasing Alice's 0.42345425 BTC

Let's say I sold my 0.1BTC KYC output to a co-worker then he/she used it for a criminal activity. Does it make me a suspect? What's the regulation for this? Or is there any? If I touch drug money in any part of my life, does it put me in their radar?
I believe as long as one plays the game by the rules, it's ok.
