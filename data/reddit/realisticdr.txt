One thing that really creates great miscommunication among people is the time-frame people are talking about. One person is thinking in the one or two year range, while the other person is thinking 10-15 year range. This is very common, something I've noticed about Bitcoin, politics, and more. Anyway, I think what may be possible is that in 20 years, if current adoption and trends continue (which nothing is for sure, of course - you're obviously sceptical), what we know now as "bitcoins" may be a more stable, rare transaction utility/tool used only for bigger movements of value, perhaps. Litecoin may be used as daily currency of sorts in some parts of the world, while Dogecoin is a main sponsor of a new decentralized sporting league of sorts. Total hypothetical. 
Of course there is a lot of conjecture and wonder with such technology. You may not think it's that great, but a lot of people do. There's a lot of potential. New ideas are needed.  
Edit: I was going to say: you could be the person to use the Bitcoin protocol to write the first voting tool for decentralized voting in your local community.

I get where you're coming from. I may be biased but my city and region is gradually becoming more aware and adopting Bitcoin. We just got an atm in our city recently. We read about adoption everyday, whether it's big or small companies. Again, I see where you're coming from and can appreciate your perspective, but think that our ability to quantify adoption is pretty limited at this point in time.

Holy guacamole! That's a lot of Skyhooks and merchants Batman!

What? Tf? You don't make any sense. You aren't comprehending or reading what I'm saying. One of my first posts addressing you was: "... you can't help but see a degenerated world, void of mathematical sensibilities and reason." 
Don't you see? You're a stats guy, I mentioned that before you even replied. You're a stats guy and know how stupid people can be when it comes to probabilities and/or data. This has, in turn, left you unimaginative, bland, and stalker-like. There's a better world out there, dude. Your help is needed.
Edit: Just read a little of your post history. I see you like skydiving. I was in the military for a while and mostly like jumping, too. Some people think skydiving is statistically and veritably stupider than bitcoin. They have a point. I don't necessarily agree with them, though.

I think Figure 1 is too much, too soon. Swap it with Figure 2 at least, which is much more intuitive and open to understanding. Overall great in my somewhat limited knowledge.

I agree with what you're saying in many respects. A lot depends on where you are personally in the "adoption" process also, which is something to remember. Some people, I've found, just don't have the time, wherewithal, or desire to understand or see change in a system - they're just too busy with life and children or other problems/issues. 
With that said, I'm with you a 100% on speaking up intelligently and positively on the matter when the times come. I truly think just asking merchants if they accept bitcoin or not is powerful. Describing it as "solving an old math problem" and "saving owners money by bypassing visa, mc, paypal, etc..." is a great combination to pique their interest.

Speaking to myself?

Ah, a 100% imagination depleted reply from the weird stalker guy. I guess that's why you're a stats prog. [Good one](

I've been following the twos of yous conversation. It's been great, thanks for it. So, you guys/gals may have heard and thought of the implications of Bitcoin and may have become desensitized to some of the potential benefits, as I see it, in the long run. 
One of your harsh critiques above, wonderkindel, is akin to 'why a protocol?' 'why a protocol for monetary value?' 




 .. because we need it. Oooh scary "corruption" is actually rampant in modern culture at modern population levels. Because we built it and has proven useful and adaptive. *Because its mathematically understandable and applicable across numerous regions of time and space in innumerable forms.* 
Edit: My point is that regardless of your personal position, if you understand Bitcoin in both protocol and currency, we should be looking to further adoption and education, regardless of mere *potentials* of control by banks, corporations, or governments. We have a tool at hand that is ... nice.

If you're pre-ordering mining hardware, don't do it. It's highly finnicky wares with a lot of testing and re-testing before shipment. The companies that sell the hardware are all shipping late because of this. It's not just a BFL thing. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 04:37:28
I, too, worry about greater control through classical "one-world currency" means, but envision a [brighter]( side of life: humanity is progressive and adaptive in nature. In a long enough time-frame, a person's desire to do something different for greater good or alter the status quo or environment approaches maximum likelihood. That could be improving the latest gadget or implementing the latest provably fair voting system (now possible, let's get on it). The Bitcoin protocol enables more people to see avenues of growth and adventure that we didn't know to exist while, also, simultaneously working around any previous supposed limitations or trust issues. 
It's a double-edged sword, though, I suppose. We need real leadership right now to represent the better, more righteous future. We also need more people thinking in new ways with our new-found abilities - whether it's the bum on the street, the NSA analist, dumb-ass scientist, or corrupted politician. We have a chance to really transform the world for the better. It's not the end all be all for the human adventure or condition, but if we can use but a fraction of the potential energy in Bitcoin through "universal" ledgers, we'll be moving in what seems to be an overall positive direction.

Interesting paper. The author seems to be a little biased, but that may be my interpretation. It's a good summarization with highlights of potential benefits, though I don't think he fully grasps the pervasive nature of the internet and people and associated software and hardware when speaking about paying taxes at the central bank and/or plenary power of the government.   
@_date: 2014-06-25 17:19:53
Your sarcasm and condescension are laughable. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 17:36:39
We're ridiculously full of ourselves? Heh, yeah, ok. Says the guy that is addicted to acting like a weird stalker. Your behaviour isn't "watching a car crash ... that hasn't happened yet" as you've so adroitly explained. It's more like you standing on the side or in the middle of the freeway waving your foam hands that say "repent now or go to hell!" - in hopes you'll get to watch a crash or accident and "help" those in need. That's more accurate.
Edit: You know, I get it, you have critiques on bitcoin. That's cool and is totally warranted. What's not warranted though is your condescending "oh honey ... I've been on this sub longer than most people can read" non-sense. Pfft. Statistical progammer - nice ;) You've probably tried to be real nice and reaonable in the past with your criticisms (probably hmm?), but got so tired of the flak, that you've resorted to acting like a prick. I cant' necessarily blame you, but it's weird and unhealthy, in the long run. 
I'm in Bitcoin to help humanity. Call me stupid and a cult member if that helps you sleep at night. Though, I have quite a bit of education and am mathematically inclined to a degree higher than the average person and like to think I see a path to assisting the world and humanity through bitcoin, whether it ultimately succeeds or not. Just getting more people understanding monetary policy, which bitcoin has done, could be considered a success.

Yeah, the whole "ID" for the means to buy food or drugs is irrelevant to the matter at hand.
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:15:33
I agree with the OP overall. Though, I see the issue at hand something like the parable of the broken window insomuch there's a problem being created where there wasn't one before. So, there are essentially infinite number of "bills" for serialization in the bitcoin universe, right? How many are going to be deemed clean and worthy out of infinity?
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:50:31
Well, I stand corrected then. No schools have lockers!?
@_date: 2014-06-25 17:26:01
Painfully obvious that you just can't help yourself. You're addicted to acting like a condescending know-it-all. See, the difference between people like you and people like "us" is that we see a better world out there - you, on the other hand, can't help but see a degenerated world, void of mathematical sensibilities and reason. Bravo. 
See, you may be right. Bitcoin may fizzle. But, not if we have anything to say about it. There's more of us than there are of you. :)

This is killer. It makes Bitcoin explanation sensible and smooth. 
Bitcoin addresses are like lockers at school! Easily related. 
"Anyone can send money into any other locker they want by just writing the locker name, but you can only take something out if you have the key. If you have the locker key then you can open the locker and send some money to any other locker, almost free, in a minute or less. ... 
This is the big cool new important amazing idea people are excited about: 
    -World-wide free perfect memory book of up-to-date facts      that anyone can see any time, and
    -No one can change the past facts."
