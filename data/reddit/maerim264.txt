@_date: 2018-05-06 07:51:06
@_date: 2018-05-31 00:35:17
It was a great sign when they starting accepting it . 
Now its a great sign they are not ? 
Same as the people who say the price dropping is a good thing .
Denial is one hell of a drug 
@_date: 2018-05-06 08:55:33
You were warned ...

Looks like its bleeding $$ 
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:30:40
There is no manipulation  .
Only supply and demand.    Right now the hype is over and less people care about Bitcoin. 
If you did not already cash out over $10,000, you will only lose more actual money in future .
But you don't care I guess.
So why post telling us again? 
Thats the opposite of not caring .
@_date: 2018-05-19 10:58:44
You watch too many super hero movies .
Learn english and stop being a drama queen.

@_date: 2018-05-23 02:05:18
Agree 100%
The gold rush is over 
Any major new money is already in ..
If you made $ than good for you ..
If you missed out, do not expect to see such gains ever again.
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:38:50
Another atm ripping people off ...
Why is this progress again? 
@_date: 2018-05-21 09:07:44
How long can we keep using that same excuse ?? 
1 year ? 10 years ? 
@_date: 2018-06-21 00:40:05
So everything you invest in will grow if you just wait long enough ?  
What a crock .
The boom happened last year . 
You were either in or out then .
BTC will always have some value but we have already seen the peak .
Lots are just in denial . 
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:38:23
Dumbest thing ever said .  Congrats
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:26:03

@_date: 2018-06-13 11:27:24
Ok  ... crazy person
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:03:36
He is right. 
Gold Rush is over .
If you made $ than great .   
If not, keep refreshing that web page and be depressed seeing red candles. 
No reason at all it will go over $10,000 again.   
@_date: 2018-06-01 06:56:58
So you felt qualified to write a book about it?   Now your not able to form your own opinion about it .
.. 
Sounds about right 
@_date: 2018-06-12 09:41:12
Its not a scam .
Rules and laws change almost daily .
This is part of this exciting new internet $ we play with. 
Its not all fun .
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:38:03
Less than 1 year ago ...
Sad huh ? 
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:58:15
Dumb ....
You will never see any profits .
Unless your only doing it because "you believe in the technology"
Lol 
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:24:58

@_date: 2018-06-08 10:00:39

Sell now or lose more $ every hour 
Your choice 
@_date: 2018-03-30 07:28:36
Liar     
Just admit its 95% about the $
Why else did you invest 
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:02:32
You two are more boring than my friends .... only with dumb accents .
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:53:32
Zooming out does not have the same WOW factor as before ...
Stop putting false hope into people
@_date: 2018-03-20 01:12:17
Even your response is boring .
Yawn

Drama queens make me bored.
Grow up 
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:19:27

This is very bad and annoying .
Stop being bad and annoying .
Thanks 
@_date: 2018-04-10 05:55:55
Welcome to btc 
If it gets regulated, the price stays tbe same and nobody gets a lambo ever..
If not,  you can expect the same pattern you seen the last few months ..
Price lowering by $1000 eaxh month or so till triple digits ...
Time fo make any real $ is over 
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:29:50
Get use to it   
Not seeing $8000 till 2022
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:33:49
Enough with the liars ...
Same as you wanting a girl, she says no ...    then you say you only wanted to be friends anyway because you appreciate her too much.
You wanted to get rich and found out you will not .   
Now you have to justifiy it somehow

Complete opposite of what bitcoin is suppose to be about .
DO NOT USE THEM 
@_date: 2018-04-29 13:18:53
If you want to pay 20% at some shady atm in horrible part of town, maybe...
