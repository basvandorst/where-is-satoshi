I really like it, but why show the next 30 days of trading data? Then you can just buy and sell on every single rise and fall without any negative effects as you know what's to come?  
Should you not be showing the past 30 days of history?

I suppose that is true, but for someone like me who likes to make a trade and see if I predicted correctly the game loses a lot of fun seeing as I know whether I was correct or not before I make the trade.
But for the purpose of simply battling for the "highest score" sure that makes sense.
Great game otherwise! :)

Several months ago, I uploaded a few private keys to blockchain since my offline wallet was being a complete mess. A few hours after uploading it, all of my bitcoins disappeared. So if they were hacked, they were hacked quite some time ago.

Hehehhe made me laugh.

1-2 days if I remember correctly for SEPA transfers.
I went with kraken instead though. So honestly I have no idea. Then again I only use kraken to buy bitcoin, then sell it straight away again other places.
As of right now, I'm holding in kraken though. Waiting for price to drop further, buy as much as I can, wait to a rise in price. Then continue selling.

Wouldn't that be considered in the green?
Sorry, I've spent a lot of time in forex trading before I started with cryptocurrencies in the beginning of december. Could be a term only used in forex.

Honesrly I'd just buy from Kraken or Gemini. Slightly more convoluted but fees are muuuch lower.
If you're ok with fees and want convenience use Wirex or crypto.com.
Send me a PM if you need help. Happy to take you step by step through it.

Neteller is made by Paysafe Group PLC, the same company that has brought Skrill, PaysafeCard, PaysafeCash and of course, Neteller.  
You could try contacting them on their [website]( probably best to go through their sales and ask to be redirected as I imagine that's the fastest way to get to an actual human.

Thanks. Fixed it.

Be prepared for a crazy drop anyway. Everyone's moving to BCH after the B2X fiasco. Even Bitcoin.com is advertising to use BCH instead.

Brollikk, your intentions are good, while I agree "slightly" with TechnicalFrame with the idea behind giving a man a fish vs teaching him to fish, he is being an asshole.  
I'm super amazed at what you're doing, any help is better than no help at all! You're an awesome person for doing what you're doing.   
I would suggest putting the money towards getting better clothing, finding a potential job and housing. I know of some other organisations that builds mini houses for the homeless which I think is pretty awesome. While small donations won't be able to do that, maybe it can be enough to facilitate transport costs to such a place?

I personally use the following:  
Mistertango (Looks like shit, works like a dream)  
Skrill  
Here's a list someone put together:

If I remember  correctly it is 1%, Send me a message tomorrow and I will double check for you. Currently out at a pub with work colleagues so don't have access to a PC but if you send me a PM I will check as soon as I wake up

It's exchanged at market rate on deposit at  Once exchanged, mistertango takes a 1% fee.
So I guess as long as there's liquidity on btc-exchange then there's only a 1% fee

A very simple way to find out is, who controls the private keys? Are you sending your bitcoins to the website and seeing a balance go up on the website? Or are you seeing your own wallet on the webpage that only you have access to?
If you don't own the private keys, you don't own the bitcoins. Simple.

I had a closer look at this. Bitgo is probably one the best places you can store your bitcoins. In the event of any failure you can use the below tool to get your unencrypted private keys and access your wallet from anywhere.
[Bitgo Recovery tool](
If I were you, I'd leave those bitcoins right where they are, safely placed in your bitgo wallet.
EDIT: IT allows you to recover your bitcoins by sending it to another wallet using a recommended fee desginated by bitcoinfees.21.co.
I presume in the event that you'd like to access your private keys you can contact bitgo support and ask them to get a tool that can unencrypt your private keys. Most likely there already exists such tools, and I just haven't found them.

I just opened an account and had a look at it. I have to admit it's quite impressive. Bitgo seems to be incredibly secure.
I don't see anyway in which you can export your private keys though. I found that you can download an encrypted with your passcode version of your private key but I found no way in which to view your unencrypted private keys. 
In the most likely scenario you'll be absolutely fine, but incase anything were to go wrong, I don't see any way in which you can open your wallet anywhere other than on bitgo.
This means if there's a hardfork you'd need to rely on bitgo to split your coins and make sure they do everything right.
In the event that anything goes wrong it's good to have your private keys so you can open your wallet anywhere. From the looks of it your wallet can only be opened on bitgo with their encryption. But only you have access to it, so it is as secure as you can get. Just maybe not the best in the event that anything could go wrong.

What website/exchange is that? Haven't seen it before.
