I'm guessing you think that because it isn't a commodity (which is disputable, imo) it can't be money, and things that aren't money but are a unit of exchange are called "fiat".
That is not why they are called fiat, they are called fiat because their value derives solely from a legal authority forcing the use of them, usually in the payment of taxes/denomination of debt contracts.

These are all cases of fraud, except the Skyrim one. They all involve misleading people to buy your work.
On the Skyrim one, what you mean is unclear, I'm a programmer, and there is no 'copy the code and release as your own game.' I assume you mean selling complete, exact copies (compiled software, artwork, game resources) as if you had made them, in that case, it would still be fraud, because you claimed to be the creator.
If you mean creating a very similar game and calling it Skyrim 1) this is how nearly all video games are created, and 2) who cares? The only people in the world who would care are the developers of the game, and to be frank, they are not special, and should devise a way to capture profits that doesn't impose constraints on third parties (btw, many game companies already are, because they whether they realize it or not, the reality of the world is that intellectual property will never be respected by the majority of people, they know how cheap it is to copy information, and see IP as a scheme to restrict the supply of a nearly limitless resource - information).
Edit: as long as they continue to call it Skyrim, it might be fraud.
Almost everything related to intellectual creations is slowly moving towards a service model precisely because "intellectual property" doesn't matter in the real world. The ones who are successful are realizing that creating culture is a service, not a product, and adapting their business models towards that end.
Note: in all these cases it's only fraud if they actually claim to be the original creators, and exact payment. I am a programmer, I write software for a living. I do not think that I have a right to secure future profits based solely on _someone else spending their resources copying my past work_. In fact, I think that copying past work (and occasionally improving on it)  is basically the source of human progress.

You're land is scarce and belongs to you.
What data I encode on my hard drive is up to me.
"Copyright" says that my property rights are inferior to your copyright.
When I "violate" your copyright I do it without harming anything you actually own.
Copyright is inherently an attempt to usurp property rights.


I responded to them, I didn't brush over them.


So you're telling me they just magically have copies of everyone's work the moment it's written down? It's the creator's responsibility to enter into NDAs with anyone they show the work to.

The rich can invest to fight the falling value of their currency, the poor often do not have the knowledge of investing to do so, and rarely the funds (especially with all the fees nowadays).

@_date: 2014-10-07 09:15:41


1) Feelings are not enough to justify the use of force against someone. Copyright rests solely on force. I am not a party to you're copyright contracts, but somehow, due to the magical thinking of government, they are enforceable against me, even though it doesn't damage your existing property - only frightens you about potential future profits.
2) What you're talking about is not a fundamental rights issue, it's an issue of how an entrepreneur/laborer gets compensated for their work, it's akin to whether or not they get paid in cash or credit. I am telling you that the way it currently works is fundamentally violence based. It does not have to be that way and in fact functioning systems exist that would compensate people without using the threat of violence at all. Some people would no longer have a bully on their side. This does not mean they won't get compensated, no one likes to work for free, and if their compensation was inadequate they would simply not do the work. The only real difference would be in the order of operations.


Again, why does it matter if it's a large company or a small one?
If disney thought this filmmakers work was worthy of distribution, why wouldn't they want a contract with them for the first-to-deliver advantage?
The creators of content will simply need to work out compensation in advance of releasing it (I believe this is called an option contract).


And who would ever show them a script again?


1) This is only possible with static content.
2) As I have said before, there is nothing wrong with copying. You do it with every word you utter, unless you claim to be the originator of those words. Many of the non-personal thoughts you have are derivative of the (unpaid for) culture you were raised in. Your name was even invented by someone else, probably thousands of years ago.
1) What criteria makes something a copy vs. an emulation?
2) How long should "intellectual property" last for?
3) What should happen to "intellectual property" when the creator dies?
4) Assuming copy and emulation are distinct for you, are they both wrong?
5) What makes copying wrong?
6) What makes selling a copy wrong?

Why does the size of the entity publishing the work matter to you (NBC), and if it doesn't: do you think the same standard applies to fan-fiction?
The model of information-as-a-scarce-product is just plain wrong. It will collapse. It's on it's way now.
Especially with the rise of things like Kickstarter, IndieGoGo, (Lighthouse?) funding of creative work will be much less problematic in the future. And distribution platforms (Netflix, Steam, Amazon, Spotify) will want content created regardless of whether or not they can capture profits perfectly and in perpetuity anyway.
The model of how this stuff will work is not drastically different from what there is now - the only problem is a lot of people don't want it to work this way. They want "creators" to "own" the result of their work in a way that just doesn't match reality. The major part that would change is the relationship between content producers and content distributors. Mostly in that content distributors would not be required to pay creators. This sounds much worse than it would be, most content is given away already. The major difference that would happen is that 1) most distributors would begin producing content for their networks in house (many already do this) for the first mover advantage of having the content on day 1. 2) Independent content creators would likely produce on a commission or subscription basis.


You can stream almost anything you want for free right now, no one is stopping you. I personally use mostly commercial services to get my entertainment (Netflix, Amazon, Steam, Spotify). Their models are 90% on point with what I am talking about. If copyright disappeared tomorrow they would still have a customer base. The "free" alternatives all come with opportunity costs: risk of pc infection (for laymen), unpredictable content quality, unpredictable availability, no customer service whatsoever.

The difference between copying a table and copying software isn't as clear as you seem to think.
Copying a table is literally exactly the same concept as copying software, and I mean the plain old copy operation that every computer does when you right click and press copy, and then later click paste. 
Copying a table =&gt; taking wood you already own mimicking the abstract form of someone else's table.
Copying software =&gt; re-configuring magnetic polarities (or whatever your storage device uses) to mimic the abstract form of someone else's software.
In both cases the person doing the copying is using real world resources they already own - the only difference is that it's drastically cheaper to copy pure information.
In your apparent belief system "intellectual property" is in direct conflict with real property rights.

I guess it does fit a recent definition in monetary economics. One which suffers from a continuum problem, IMO. If whether or not something is fiat relies on it's endogeneity that implies it exists on a continuum.

Information asymmetry is core to the understanding of Austrian School economics.
The problem with 'regulation' is precisely that there is no credible way to select regulators that are on the right side of the asymmetry in the first place, even if there was one it would be prone to corruption. And when they are corrupt, they are likely to get away with it.
On the flip side of that there are market based 'seals of approval'. 
For example the UL you find on most basic electronics is a certification from: [Underwriters Lab]( that the product meets industry standards. This is a market-based entity that loses market share over time if they are not a reliable source of information. And this is just one example of a market based solution. The other possible solutions to this problem that don't involve regulations are bounded only by imagination and effectiveness.

I mean if I walk around saying "he got all that money from stolen target data" about anyone that had some cash on them, wouldn't anyone in earshot be liable for this same crime, if they transacted with the person in question?

Blockchains are ledgers, nodes are accountants, miners are notaries. 
Every notary has at least one accountant that they trust to validate and verify the state of the ledger, which may or may not be themselves.
Notaries are allowed to self issue a scheduled amount of Bitcoins when they notarize a new set of entries in the ledger, in addition to the scheduled amount there are voluntary fees that a notary may collect upon notarization.
Notarization standards are enforced by &gt;= 51% of the other notaries agreeing on the state of the ledgers.
Notarization standards ensure that the self-issuance does not exceed the scheduled amount, and that the notarization task happens roughly every 10 minutes.
The rules are secondarily (but necessarily) enforced by incentives. Changing the schedule would cause a near-instantaneous devaluation of Bitcoin, so notaries do not wish to waste their investment trying to change the schedule.
Edit: mentioned fees.

Also I think it would be useful to point out to Peter that bitcoin can be backed by gold (via Colored Coins), it's just that the market does not find this to be useful (maybe due to current technical burden) at the moment.

That's neat, it will always be inaccurate though, unless your claim is that these mathematical economists can perfectly account for (and predict) the actions and internal reasoning of billions of intelligent creatures, based on a few aggregate measures. Humans learn. Predicting the actions of a learning being with mathematical precision is basically impossible, especially if those learning beings are allowed to see you're predictions before the due date.
By using qualitative analysis an economist can make qualitative predictions.


Neither do pure mathematicians. Does that make math wrong? Unscientific?

His opinion was simplistic and under-developed. That is not a sound reason to not speak on a subject. Conversation is a primary factor in teaching people things. Not everyone is an introvert (I am) who does the research independent of face-to-face interactions.
There are many prima-facie reasons for an experienced trader to think that Bitcoin is a scam. There is a reason that Erik Vorhees extended a civil hand towards him. He understands that Peter has good reason to be skeptical, in Peter's world many of the characteristics of Bitcoin scream "Penny stock pump and dump, pyramid scheme, ponzi."
Saying that someone has to know all of the characteristics of something before they have a right to opine on that thing is frankly supporting the concept of argument from authority.
Writing somebody completely off because they were wrong about one thing is very short-sighted.

Supply and demand. If you think this is unreasonable price level you don't understand either the suplly or the demand, or both.


That's changing all the time, look here:  . That site has had a growth in registered outlets that is absolutely astounding. Less than 2 weeks ago they had about 650 locations registered there.


That's because the userbase is growing dramatically right now, and the suplly is limited. This will necessarily cause a continual panic cycle in the people who don't understand user adoption curves.


That may be true, I have no experience with it. When I want to buy bitcoins, I do so through face-to-face meetings. When I want to sell I buy something that I consider worth while at the existing retailers who accept it.


Few people get paid in bitcoins. But there are many reasons that I want to have bitcoins vs. fiat currency (or even gold, which I also like).


It is. But It's also a way to avoid the currency risk of the USD. If you expect bitcoin's value to rise vs fiat (which I do) then you feel safer in bitcoin than in USD.


May be true. I'm willing to try something new instead of USD/Fiat. As I see it as long as there are markets that accept it in and no superior currency, the worst that could happen is the price goes down. Which I don't care about as long as the currency survives.


I like the potential for anonymity but even without it a fixed supply currency is a thousand times better than Fiat. Especially when there are no intermediaries that can prevent me from spending it.


So was the internet when it first came about. New tech means new problems to solve.


Escrow is possible through the protocol itself, with multisignature transactions. Even so, reputation matters. If you don't want to do due diligence on a retailer, the system may not be ready for you. But it will be, just wait.


So what? I'd bet a large number of daily transactions in USD are for beer and cigarrettes. Does that have anything to do with the viability of USD?


Vs the infrastructure to run all the intermediaries in fiat? I'd bet you that it's not even 1% of the traditional consumption.
Also it's not waste. That's not computation solely done for the sake of computation. Those computations are what secure the network.

Speculators can't really hold a price level indefinitely. If they try to hold it too high, buyers will dry up until someone lowers their asking rate, the first to do so being the person who nets the highest prices at that instant in time.
Conversely they can't hold it down for long either; Other speculators will buy them up for arbitrage, since non-speculators will be willing to pay more.

A full node keeps a complete transaction history, and synchronizes in real time with the rest of the network. You'd be running an automatic auditor for the rest of the network.
TBH, though it wouldn't do much but waste your CPU cycles, the mining network already aggressively does this (I believe).
It might provide a benefit to the network in the sense that you would route transactions to miners if you open the proper port (I think, I don't really know).
Jiten is right, after all the light nodes have to get their information from somewhere.
