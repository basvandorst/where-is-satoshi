Highly unlikely the coins are redistributed tbh. I think whales dump (let's say 1000 coins at 13k) and then buy back the same amount of coins at a lower price (1000 coins at 11k). They've effectively just made 2,000,000 dollars by doing so

i don't see it affecting price as much as you think. bitcoin doesnt care if china bans it, and it certainly wont care if china decides not to ban it. hope i'm wrong

High is pretty far from low

Don't mind the trolls. 
Make sure you have the option to select your own seed phrase, write it down and store it somewhere safe. 
Download ledger live to install/uninstall apps on your ledger and you're good to go

maybe noob question, but what does it mean by putting btc in ln network? im pretty sure my btc are all in a native segwit address. is this considered it in the lightning network?
@_date: 2019-10-12 23:57:58
Apps on ledger are just different crypto currencies you're interested in storing (bitcoin, ethereum, etc)
Definitely have some bitcoin but if you're interested in alts ledger supports a lot of them!

Bought $20 last night. Should I cash out and use my profits for 20 nuggets at McD?

Thank you for explaining!
@_date: 2019-10-23 10:09:13
Thank you for clarifying! So if I had my btc through ledger they take care of the lightning channels every time I send btc?

Gotcha. I think I was confused on the difference between lightning network and segwit but it makes sense to me now

because 0.00001 BTC could be worth 10000000000 dollars in 69 years and you woulda sold low for a dumb lambo

normally it'd be complete after 6 confirmations, but may be a glitch on their end. has it been resolved? if not you might wanna contact coinbase support

no one's holding a gun to your head telling you not to sell. your money your problem; make your own decision. all i'm saying is if you're panicking during a price drop then you probably put in waaay more than you should've in the first place
@_date: 2019-12-05 17:44:41
It takes some time for the transaction to be confirmed. If you've confirmed its the right address it'll get there

nothing is guaranteed in any market and is all technically speculation.. not sure what kind of scientific evidence you're looking for
