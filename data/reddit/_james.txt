A Chinese man, a German and an Irishman walk into a pub. Only the German has remembered his wallet so he buys all the drinks for the night. At the end of the night the other two settle their debt by sending him bitcoin from their phones. All the transactions are completed successfully.

Tbh i'm not up to date on what the best security products are at the moment, i hear that the default microsoft antivirus, microsoft security essentials is pretty decent.
I think what's more important is how the average person uses their computer. If you have a wallet.dat on your pc, be a lot more thoughtful checking links before you click them, avoid clicking through untrusted sites, don't open an email from someone you don't know that says you won a bitcoin cruise, you know the usual stuff.
The most important thing is any btc that you don't think you will be spending in the near future should be kept offline in a [cold wallet]( and only keep small amounts on 3rd party (online wallets and such). This minimizes your risk.

Thanks! I was going for simple and functional.

This is good. You should post this at bitcointalk

It can be, but it has to be diversification on merit. The alt has to solve a problem that the current market leader bitcoin can't (which is why it won't be litecoin, as it is redundant). There are a few interesting concepts being worked on at the moment dealing with things like completely anonymous coins etc that will have some demand.

That's actually not true at all. BTC is one of the only investments on earth that could conceivably hit $0 in a day. If some inherent flaw was found in the protocol the price would absolutely plummet. Outlawing it may also have a similar effect. I'm bullish bitcoin but lets not get silly - we are still in beta, the risks are still huge

You likely would've sold at $40 or $100 or $200 though right?

With less regulation comes more responsibility on the community to learn to police itself. People need to be active in warning others against scams. You think it's bad now, wait until impoverished nations start hearing about bitcoin in numbers and we start getting bitcoin 419's.
Likewise, users need to perform a little more due diligence into companies accepting bitcoin than they would normally. It's just the nature of using a non reversible payment in an unregulated economy.
As well as adding scams to bitcoinscammers, if you recently purchased something with BTC leave a review (good or bad) on a review website:
[Bitcoin Yellow Pages](  
[Crytic](

The thing is it's kind of win win. If it rises, then yay we make money! If it "stagnates" and the price stabilizes, it strengthens bitcoins image as a viable medium of exchange. If we want mass through business, stability is our friend.
