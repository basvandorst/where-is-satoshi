TM is an inhibitor to various offchain scaling solutions though.

The core developers had nothing to do with this being ACK'd.  Infact,  luke-jr gave a NACK  response after reasonable discussion with Charlie Lee in that thread.

I think when it comes to changing the status quo, we're all in this bag together trying to disrupt existing systems.

Put it in a P2SH then?


I don't think anyone was expecting this to work in a everyday wallet, its more about the concept that yes,  using the private key linked to the address originally provided, the recipient could spend this output.

EI8HT wallet is very stable,  never had any issues with it.

They help when of those 12,  8 are just mining off the top of 1 miners node.
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:19:08
You want a lock time of `Math.floor(Date.now()/1000) + (60 * 60 * 24 * 30 * 12 * 50)` (~`3028162646`, or `0xb47e1856`).
Then it'll just be something like: 
``` 
0xb47e1856 OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP OP_DUP OP_HASH160 {pubKeyHash} OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
*edit:* added missing OP_DROP
To spend, it'd just be a normal P2PKH signature?

This is open source software,  no one is owed anything.  You want an explanation? Find it yourself.
The extent of any contributions explanation may be simply to garner its support/integration from the project owner/managers,  that is all.

Read the post,  he describes how there are several in-the-works improvements in the relay space that are going to make this all possible.
@_date: 2015-12-07 07:42:39


Somehow that seems like it'll hit that infamous "low priority" tag.
@_date: 2015-12-14 22:05:14
I don't think you realize how difficult a problem you just proposed is.
@_date: 2015-12-15 02:14:15
This has nothing to do with forking.
@_date: 2015-12-15 02:18:32
Your delay is not related to this.  Your delay is because your fee is too low anyway.
It *might* eventually be accepted due to priority, but, that is probably less likely than you think.
@_date: 2015-12-31 07:12:43
Pay someone to do it for you then?
I wouldn't want devs burdened with translation at every step,  let alone to then be persecuted by an uneducated audience.
@_date: 2015-12-17 20:53:03
It is a little endian integer:  I think.
Thanks for spotting the missing OP_DROP :)
We only need P2SH for it to pass IsStandard, but yes, no need to do the HASH160 if we do it via P2SH.
@_date: 2015-12-14 08:17:59
It's not relevant.
This PR only just got merged,  and would not have had an impact on the ecosystem yet (unless miners were already doing it).
Infact,  the number of people running the master branch probably number less than 0.1% of all nodes. [citation needed]
@_date: 2015-12-08 00:22:02
A lot has been merged in the last month,  including a lot of performance improvements to make even 8mb blocks possible CPU wise.
I'm sure between that and the multitude of relay related proposals at the conference,  he may have adjusted his opinion as to whether it is possible.
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:18:03
The core developers had nothing to do with this.
@_date: 2015-12-17 08:40:23
Depending on how smart the wallet is.
50 years leaves a lot of room for improvement.

Help build on tools that analyse the blockchain to encourage privacy research in the blockchain.
Join market needs lots of work too.
@_date: 2015-12-15 02:22:56
Was it confirmed because of priority though?
Most people are transacting less than maybe `0.1BTC`, it would take almost a week for them to get sufficient priority for this to be even begin to be relevant.
@_date: 2015-12-14 07:21:09
No it doesn't.  Your lack of a fee explains that.
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:28:39
Age is not relevant here.  You can find people like this at any point in life.
@_date: 2015-12-08 00:14:32
To only read this TLDR would be to miss 90% of the useful information surrounding this,  including maintaining blocksize patches for 2, 4 and 8mb such that they are ready to roll out if necessary.
@_date: 2015-12-20 13:52:06
I can regenerate this,   might take some time though.
@_date: 2015-12-16 03:08:04
You don't want to stop prostitution,  we want to stop harm.   Agreed that [this aspect of] bitcoin changes nothing in the US,  however,  in markets where it is already legal/regulated,  this reduces cash/chargeback risk, which is a huge benefit.
@_date: 2015-12-08 00:38:11


And 


I'd posit his strong opinion was based upon the instantaneous relay of blocks larger than 1mb,  which as shown by jtoomin in his presentation,  has huge delays currently (latency wise).

RBF doesn't need consensus.  It is policy.  Not a rule.
The only reason miners need to include *any* transactions in their blocks is such that they can make more BTC on fees.  That is all.
@_date: 2016-01-19 07:23:57
Because SegWit has a test network which developers are testing against,  and its mostly ready.

You 3 are dicks.  You may not agree with his policies,  or his ideas.   But at least have respect for a fellow human being.

And obviously 1 transaction which contains all the movement of BTC in that instance.

I'm not sure if you intended it,  but this entire post reads in favour of Core?
@_date: 2016-01-06 08:41:58
And LN brings us closer to it.
@_date: 2016-01-19 07:25:06
Sure,  lets increase the risk even more :S
@_date: 2016-01-27 05:37:06


I understand this in theory,  but how can that be quantified?
The core development often sets the tone for what is available to have consensus on, simply because, that for technical issues,  it is the **technical** community that drives consensus. (I'm wilfully ignoring the failed politicking to other parties that is also occurring)
Are you simply trying to say, that anything that is contentious should never be allowed into Bitcoin,  if its not unanimous,  it should simply not change?
@_date: 2016-01-24 09:13:38
This also applies to open source wallets unless you review every part of the code and compile it yourself.
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:19:56
If everyone wanted big blocks.  Why is core still so important?  The fact is the majority of node operators understand more about the ecosystem then many redditors and put their faith in developers who are working in their best interests.
Many of the developers are all working very hard right now to push out actual fixes to bitcoin.
Increasing the block size in an O(n^2) system simply DOES NOT SCALE.    If you have ideas,    propose them.   Otherwise let engineers focus on solving the problem, and not worry about catering to this rabid crowd of know it alls.
@_date: 2016-01-13 06:41:24
I know.  Core has not agreed to merge it yet,  as there is no viable solution.
@_date: 2016-01-18 07:12:39
Except the market is often irrational and uneducated.   Sounds like a great idea!
@_date: 2016-01-13 00:47:11
There was a soft-fork to prevent low-S transactions being accepted.
I don't think you're correct.
@_date: 2016-01-06 22:40:43
SegWit is decoupled from all these ideas.  That is the point,  SegWit is an enabler for these ideas **after** its deployment, not part of it.
@_date: 2016-01-30 09:50:10
Just broadcast a higher fee.  It may actually make it,  as a lot of miners run full RBF (not opt-in) already.
@_date: 2016-01-06 22:39:43
Because you can balance your own risk by waiting for those soft forks to become stable, without any adverse risk to the rest of the system.
@_date: 2016-01-17 07:45:47
No,  its just a filter for the mempool.   I have a filter on my mempool that accepts/relays no transactions (I run `-blocksonly`).
The difference is entirely whether miners decide to run this as **their** policy, which is entirely up to them, and always was.
To that end,   several miners have already been running like-RBF policies for a while,  this just standardized it such that it made the actual RBF consistent (assuming they run it).
@_date: 2016-01-07 00:39:05


I haven't read the proposal in depth, but, most of the script improvements/rewrites have/will be/been proposed/suggested as upgrades after the initial integration of SegWit.   This may or may not fall into that category.


By including a version number in the script field, you can arbitrarily choose version 0 (the current state of affairs for scripts) or version N, where N is some present/future softforked-in upgrade or functionality.

@_date: 2016-01-19 23:08:36
It's not like they just ignored the problem.  So much was needed for us to even get to this point.  2mb blocks would have been impossible 2 years ago without the work done in the time since.
@_date: 2016-01-08 05:17:01
I think this is the most important take away.
Nothing is wrong with the concept,  its just that if you're repeatedly trying to keep up with soft forks,  you're basically handing all power of the upgrading to miners.
@_date: 2016-01-07 00:37:06
That is the point, the amount of effort and testing is likely going to be very similar for either change, but with a soft fork, the only risk should be in the added behaviour,  compared to hard fork where the behaviour could be catastrophic to *everyone*. 


When did you consider bitcoin stable? It is subjective to the user.


What someone could do the same in a hard fork?  That would be catastrophic.
@_date: 2016-01-13 11:09:16
No, of course not.  You still have your money,  its just not showing up in the software your using.
Either upgrade your bitcoin software, or try importing it into something like Electrum.
