Hello Ematiu,
I'm trying to recover that wallet now. After importing the first of the 3 backups on the Copay MacOS wallet, I get this error:
Could not update wallet:
And this is the output of the bws server:
info Client Err: 401 /v2/wallets/?includeExtendedInfo=0&amp;twoStep=1&amp;r=37282 {"code":"NOT_AUTHORIZED","message":"Copayer not found"}
&lt;&gt; ::ffff:127.0.0.1 2018-01-30T18:50:30.032Z "GET /bws/api/v2/wallets/?includeExtendedInfo=0&amp;twoStep=1&amp;r=37282" 401 55 1.517 "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.87 Safari/537.36"
How do I recreate the wallet? I also can't find how to import the 2nd private key required to spend the funds, I see "Incomplete" on the app Home.

Sure there is. Here's his BTC donation address:

I really hope this is not intentional. Looks like a bug in their Bitcore suite with the high congestion the BTC network is dealing with.
Or maybe it is?

If you haven't already,

So it is not possible to re-create a 2-of-3 wallet using Bitcore Wallet Service on another server, with the backup files?

Thanks a lot, will try and get back to you if I encounter any issues.
Can I recreate the same wallet for Bitcoin Cash? Maybe using Bitcore v5 attached to a BCH node?

You are the MVP in r/bitcoin today!
@_date: 2017-09-23 00:00:50
Now, we just need an higher resolution one!
I like it a lot. Thinking of getting a tatoo about Bitcoin someday, this is ispiring a lot, cheers!

I had maxconnections=32, trying to remove it now...

Check previous comment, the port is reachable from outside network. cURL can succefully connect to port 8333.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:34:47
Unfortunately, it did not work.
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:13:43
Just ordered a Pi 3! Can't wait to support the network running a full node. Of course, supporting  too!
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:40:48
Yes. I emailed 21.co, apparently their node IPs were in my CSF firewall ban list.
