I don't have more than a single computer in my household.
I have no way to tell whether they are corrupt or not outside that they will not load into multibit anymore :/

i had the second newest version then tried using the newest. neither work. the older one says:
Could not load the wallet file - The error message was "com.google.protobuf.InvalidProtocolBufferException Protocol message tag had invalid wire type."'
the newer version is more generic and says:
Unable to load wallet "xxxxx.wallet" or backups. See help on "Wallet Backups" for more details.
The error was "com.google.bitcoin.store.UnreadableWalletException
Could not read wallet
com.google.bitcoin.store.UnreadableWalletException Could not read wallet".

I have my .wallet and .info files for every wallet i've ever made.
I also have the info from ~/Library/User/Application Support/Multibit but its log info. I still don't know what to do or how to fix any of this. I'm just getting the same messages:
Could not load the wallet file - The error message was "com.google.protobuf.InvalidProtocolBufferException Protocol message tag had invalid wire type."'

when i made a new wallet i saved it to a folder where it created a .wallet and a .info file. i thought those were the backups :(
i just looked and saw that i could export private keys but i don't know what thats about. so no i don't have them.
are you telling me that without those i just lost 500 bitcoins because of a multibit error? can the .wallet and .info files not be repaired somehow??? is there no way i can still export my wallet private key using the .wallet files i have not using multibit? this has to work somehow

The software itself is working fine. It just refuses to load up the .wallet files into the software so that i may access the coins and the error messages provided just say COULD NOT READ and nothing else.
i have a friend coming over now with his PC, going to transfer the wallet files to a fresh version of multibit on his computer but i doubt that will do anything, as far as i can tell the problem is with the wallet files, not the software so me moving the wallet files to someone else's computer shouldn't theoretically help as i'm bringing the problem with me.
the first github link i posted above implies a similar situation but the creator of the software said that the wallets were gone. i can't believe that if i still have the wallet files, the coins are still there that because of a corrupt file they are lost forever. the creator needs to help me. you can't throw away someones life like that, like garbage.

.dat files aren't created for wallet files. there are the .wallet and .info files and then a second .wallet file with the date as the backup i think. none of them work.

i'm on a mac but i'm not using time machine. how do i even allow a professional to try and help recover it when if i send them the wallet or info files for the wallet it essentially gives them access to my bitcoins??
i didn't export my wallet's .wallet or .info files or export my private keys. i didn't know to do any of those things. i've just been using the software, creating new wallets and storing those files in a folder on my desktop. thats all i've got. i don't understand why they won't just load up into the software. those bitcoins are all still there
