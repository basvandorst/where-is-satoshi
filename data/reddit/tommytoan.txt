we heading to somwhere between 3 to 5k until etf or soemthing else comes out.
Chance alts could boom if BTC finds its bottom. Maybe if ETF is delayed 6+months, we could see altcoins moon over xmas..

Whats needed is reasonable, sensible discussion, imo tweets/comments like this just encourage fomo, and fomo/fud is horrible.
- look at the dotcom bubble, see how high it went in 2000, look how long it took to get back there. Understand that it may be similar for crypto.
- everything in crypto is extremely overvalued. Some would argue ridiculously overvalued.
- pointing out the above does not = crypto is shit and will never succeed.

the politics, morals and ethics of everything in bitcoin are incredibly mixed, if push comes to shove the majority are on the side of lambo though.
bitcoin and crypto fundamentally has extremely egalitarian ideals. It has the best of intentions. Whether it works out that way in practice...
The main point here with crypto in regard to this posts question is, bitcoin my not be the answer, it may not give us true decentralization and all the other goodies.
But its the correct step forward, perhaps an essential step. Most of us are thinking lambo, but decades from now with bitcoin version 12.5, perhaps then it starts being the peoples money.
@_date: 2018-08-08 08:58:30
fair point, still, they arent all bad. Perhaps we see all those 3rd and 4th string cryptos in various niches like privacy/cloud storage/mobile apps go under and that money move to others

balls of steel using on of those things.

the big one for me, and probably an obvious one, the egalitarian themes pretty much every coin adopts and sells itself on, and how greedy they are/ will get

if you trust bakkt, sure.

im in the same boat atm. Charts across the board are in no mans land, we have had death crosses everywhere.
Just hope you bought recently and that the bottom isn't far off. Despite that the TA is telling us to run for your fucking life!
@_date: 2018-05-13 02:39:51
its better than bitcoin for this kind of use, probably LTC and dash are the best. fees and speed just no comparison.

he called btc a bubble at start of year, it was a bubble, it popped, it went down to 6000, he starts investing.
good trading decision imo, despite how much i think hes one of the lowest forms of human being ever to exist.

its just a study, a piece of research, if they haven't gone out of their way to artificially enforce their conclusions, then its just a bunch of data and findings for people to interpret as they will.

to be brutally honest, if this at the very least brings more scrutiny down on tether its a great thing, its essential.
Tether is like a massive blister thats turning into a late stage pressure sore, the sooner we lance this fucking thing and remove it from the crypto world, the better.
Its gonna hurt like fuck for us, but it needs to be done.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:27:45
we have seen much much crazier shit, tether is dodgy as fuck.
on a side note, if anyone wonders what it would take to bring BTC down to serious yearly lows, like sub 3k, it would be just about any negative speculation about tether right now.
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:53:19
really appreciate the reply, thanks.
ETH just hypothetical, as i should have noted more thoroughly in my post. My questions in the end have been more around understanding trading pairs, which you and others have helped me on greatly.

@_date: 2019-06-23 08:08:28
i think then my question is how can i get the best value buying alts right now.
If i buy alts with BTC, will i get as much value as buying alts with USD?
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:06:50
if i purchased BTC to ETH right now, that value isn't very good because BTC is high and likely to go down.
But if i buy USD to ETH, and ETH is already low, if BTC goes down $2000 in a day, and ETH doesnt change in value (hypothetically speaking) then thats fine.
... i think thats correct.
im better to buy ETHUSD than ETHBTC right now?
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:26:48
so $1000 USD is going to buy me the same amount of ETH as buying USDBTC, then ETHBTC?
(if we assume no fees/price stays same)
yeh i think im getting it now haha. Appreciate you hanging in there with me and explaining! exchange and transfer fees are the killer, so the cleanest way i can buy an ALT will yield the greatest value.
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:21:46
how is it stupid?
@_date: 2019-06-23 07:39:44
yeh but alts are low now, but btc is high, does that matter?

i think you are judging my intelligence and knowledge very harshly. when a person reads a comment like yours... its just a negative overall human experience.
Its lazy, honestly, rather than try to tailor a response to a person, put some effort in, you just paint broad negative strokes. If you took the time to write as much as you have, why not do it properly? I think your approach is very black and white, i hope you don't apply it outside of reddit.
also, i should have very clearly stated hypothetical from the start, so mb there. I thought in my 3rd paragraph a person would have understood im talking hypothetical and not looking for financial advice.
@_date: 2019-06-23 10:51:57
the harm you do saying something like "Forget cryptocurrency which you have exactly 0% chance of understanding..."
it far and away does more harm than the good of possibly deterring a person from making poor investing decisions.
when a person types out and hits post on a sentence like that... thats a life crossroad right there. Thats where you need to sit back for a good 5 minutes and just check in with yourself.
And I mean that. If i spend 5 mins checking in with myself on my basic understanding of numbers and monetary concepts, you should spend 5 mins checking in on your strategy with communicating to people over the internet.

if i was richer, i would agree. If shit hits the fan and my quality of life is seriously threatened, then yeh i will agree. Whilst im in this incredibly privileged first world position, i will be burying my head in the sand.
@_date: 2018-07-06 11:23:33
perhaps its going to play out differently, perhaps it wont be BTC that leads the next moon, perhaps we start to trade coins against a different outright leader, like eth or neo instead.
