Great video.  Very clear explanation of the working of the Fed.  
Question: if ordinary people switched over to a crypto economy, what would happen?
Taxes would continue to be paid in USD.  The Fed would continue to create USD.  But as accounts shifted from USD to bitcoin, the USD would lose its value.  Interest rates on USD would rise, because who wants to buy Treasuries, when the dollar value is dropping?
The good: current debts of the US Government would be easy enough to pay off in the new cheap dollars.
The bad:
Unless lending systems emerged in bitcoin, loans would be prohibitively expensive.  Without loans, commerce would grind to a halt.
Maybe it would be good, eventually, to run on a system with minimal debt, but right now it's how business is done.
As the world economy switches away from USD as a reserve currency, every USD holder gets massively poorer.
Am I right?  What else?
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:08:03
Of course there is value in the ecosystem.  But that is not identical to the technology itself, and therefore, the comparison to other technologies isn't quite right.
@_date: 2014-03-12 22:06:48
Quite possibly.  The valuation is based on Candy Crush's grip on the user's psyche.  They're selling an addictive drug.  But btc's gyrations are way more addictive.
In fact, this is a worry of mine.  Btc is volatile and Goldman, like everyone else, points out that this makes it an uncertain store of value and a terrible unit of account.  However, the volatility is also its key to success as a drug.  We get little hits of dopamine with every fluctuation.  If it ever does get really stable, maybe interest will slowly die down.

Interesting question!  In a deflationary recession, everything drops except the most liquid of assets.  In 2008, gold fell during and after the crash, right along with stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.  Only once QE got underway did gold start to gain again.
You know what went up?  Treasuries.  Even though everyone anticipated QE, Treasuries were the safest, most liquid asset at a time of panic.  They were deemed safer than other currencies, so the dollar soared in value.
The question is whether bitcoin would behave more like gold or more like dollars.  At this point, I think it would behave like gold, because it is much harder to spend than dollars.  Soon, though, it will be widely adopted, and much more liquid than dollars.  Then, I would expect bitcoin's value to go up in a recession, as it is both safe and highly liquid.  
But we're not at that point yet.  It's still viewed as an illiquid (due to flaky exchanges) and risky investment (due to volatility) that would be dumped in heartbeat as people need cash for real needs, day-to-day.  
Another way to think of it: the global pile of money, and with it, "play money" shrinks very quickly during a crash / recession.  Certain expenditures will remain the same even during the recession -- food, shelter, clothing, i.e., Walmart purchases -- and others like luxury and investment will decline.  Bitcoin is not a necessity at this point, but a speculative investment.  If this community keeps growing, it may be a really functioning currency, and not a speculative investment, and then it would have nothing to fear in a recession.

If regulators wanted to do something useful, they could compel exchanges to prove their solvency in this way... even if it were only to the regulators themselves.  That would require only minimal information for the regulators themselves and leak nothing at all to the larger community.

Another thing has changed: a larger percentage of potential investors have already heard about bitcoin.

5% of gold would be fantastic.  Until there is a compelling, knock-down, answer to the  worries about 51% attacks, bitcoin will not replace gold.
The remittance market is another story.  As Allaire said, it is a predatory business that bitcoin can destroy if there's  enough liquidity and functioning exchanges worldwide.  
Most of that savings will not go into the value of bitcoin, but rather, the pockets of (typically poor) consumers worldwide.  That could grow the world economy by a trillion or two each year from the bottom up.  Even better news than making a little more money off one's bitcoin investment.
More than looking at existing markets bitcoin can disrupt -- gold, remittances -- I'm excited about the markets bitcoin will create.  Right now, there is no way to pay the Iranian blogger, no way to purchase many overseas products, no high-speed, easy commerce for the 6 billion marginally banked.  
Bitcoin isn't just going to take a piece of the pie, but "grow the pie higher" as someone once said.  It's just going to be growth that happens from the periphery inward, rather than the usual "Goldman first" pattern.

Two things need to happen to prevent manipulation.
1. The "market cap" needs to grow at least 100x, so the fiat-wealthy cannot manipulate.
2. Early adopters need to diversify, so the bitcoin-wealthy cannot manipulate.

May I ask: why did you keep your coins in an exchange with a horrible, horrible reputation for ineptitude?  If you had that many coins and left your job for bitcoin, you must have known about paper wallets.  Why didn't you put some btc in cold storage?
I left Gox in June 2011 when they proved their amateur status and never looked back.  I have a tiny fraction of the coins you had.

Yeah, really bitcoin has taught me more about humanity than money or tech.  Humans are idiots who thrill to price spikes, despair at drops, anchor on prices that are 1000% increases, experience adrenal withdrawal symptoms when prices are stable, and are generally wracked with paranoia and drawn to FUD.
Thing is... I am human too and display all of the above characteristics.  Though at least I've been here since June 2011 and have a little perspective on my own tendencies.
@_date: 2014-01-26 02:10:40
Shiller spotted the two major bubbles of the past 15 years, so I give him a lot of credit.  But I doubt he understands the tech in this case.  He's looking at the charts and the amount of transactions in bitcoin.  He's not thinking about all of the possibilities.
But you're right about everything else.  Bitcoin does two things really well: one is to make payments very efficient and fast.  That brings a lot of efficiency to the marketplace, disintermediating the existing payment services.  That makes bitcoin appealing, but doesn't necessarily increase the price, because the transactions can convert back to fiat so quickly no one needs to hold bitcoin for long.
The other function is to limit supply.  This makes bitcoin  appealing as a store of value.  Volatile?  Yes, of course.  But the trend should at least be upwards, given the limited supply.
The store of value function is where bitcoin's price is driven.  Gains go to investors.  The payment efficiency function doesn't reward investors so much, but mostly users (merchants especially, but also consumers if they get discounts).
Hopefully these two functions will work together to make the currency overall valuable.

The headaches will not be on the tech side.  It is a fairly simple idea, and no shortage of smart people working on it.
The problem will be on the legal / regulatory side.  What is it to "assign" a certain value or privilege or ownership to a certain portion of the blockchain?  How does one write such a contract and is that contract enforceable?
In contract law, there are lots of restrictions on enforceable contracts.  (For instance, the fees that a business charges to customers cannot be egregious.)  Likewise, if a stock certificate, say, is stolen, then that certificate cannot be enforced as a proof of ownership.
These complex legal limitations are part of what makes the legal and financial services world so expensive, and I don't think they can be automated.  
This is a super-promising space, but don't look for the kind of radical "permissionless innovation" here, at least in the short term, because we are really talking about contracts, and contracts are the subject of hundreds of years of common and statutory law that is anything but simple.

Good question.  Well, gold is deflationary, so their arguments apply equally well to gold, yet they won't admit they're wrong about gold either.

Maybe so. I'm not into alts myself, but I think of them as a guard against one point of failure for crypto.  Suppose China has 51% of asic computing power, PLUS the factories to keep it.  Suppose they decide to control the currency.  What do we do?  Especially if all our alt ideas are converted over to side chains?  
I hope folks keep working independently of the btc blockchain, for the sake of ecological diversity.  Sidechains are like every foodstock plant being tied to the dna of a particular strain of corn.  Not a good idea in nature, and no better an idea in currency.

Paper wallet 'on Coinbase'?  Don't understand.  If it's really a paper wallet it should only be on paper. 
The question is whether Coinbase has your private keys.  If so, then you only have a paper copy.  That's not a true paper wallet.  If not, then they can't lose your money on your behalf.

If people voted with price, we just wouldn't see such hysteria on reddit, is all i'm saying.
My question is: why does everyone continue to mine on GHash despite the warnings?  For profit.  but if that very same decision caused bitcoin price to drop, because worriers like myself sell when hashing power is concentrated, then maybe they'd make a different decision for the same reason: profit.
If coin prices go down, you lose more in profit than the minor efficiency gains on GHash.  That is all.

Well, good luck.  It's still a prisoner's dilemma, the bane of libertarians everywhere.  Invisible hand does not solve collective action problems.
If a bitcoin wallet is hackable and whoever hacks it can steal, say, 10,000 coins, then I can *whitehat* and improve bitcoin's future, but not get any bitcoins for myself, or hack it and get 10,000 bitcoins, which my hack will make worth less in the long run.  Let's say my hack makes bitcoin worth 1% less.  So stealing is worth 10,000 - 1% of 10,000, which is 100 btc = 9,900 btc.  White hat?  Depends on how much I hold.  If I hold only 10 coins, then by prevent one hack, I stop a 1% loss in the value of the coins I already hold, e.g., .1btc.
From an individual's perspective, the black hat strategy pays a lot more.

It's amazing to me that the cold wallet could "leak".  Isn't that the whole point of a cold wallet???  The coldness of a cold wallet is the fact that the private keys are not online.
Didn't anyone have to manually scan the private keys to the cold wallets?  Wouldn't their wallet show them as having enough in the hot wallet, but customers' complaints required them to go to the cold wallets?  Wouldnt' that alert them to issues before they emptied all of the freaking cold wallets?

Not true.  The banks do not delay these payments for months.  Why is withdrawal relatively easy from the other exchanges?  The banks just pick on Gox?  And only on the withdrawal side?

There's a sucker born every minute and fraud and incompetence will never cease.  The free unregulated market does not stop these things ever.

First, I am not convinced the doomsdayers are right.  The market says they're wrong.
Second, I think btc will drop if there is a crash.  Look at the behavior of gold in 2008.  It dropped as people fled to the most liquid assets available, while Treasuries skyrocketed, even while Bernanke was announcing that he would be dumping dollars from helicopters to avoid a Great Depression redux.
In any kind of crash, there's just a massive loss of dollars on balance sheets.  That is the money supply shrinking.  People start to sell their "investments" to meet real, pressing needs.  Currently, those needs cannot be met in bitcoin, which is a speculative investment.  When things go south, speculative assets get dumped.
Now, in the aftermath of the crash, during the recovery, gold took off as people feared inflation.  I would expect a similar pattern for bitcoin.

This is Tyler Cowen's argument, that the low barrier to entry means bitcoin's value simply equals the marketing price of rival currencies, and nothing more.
The positive spin is that with infinitely many new coins possible, one cannot say that crypto is deflationary.  There's an unending money supply in the form of new coins.
Myself, I think these new coins reach a different audience.  They will be unstable, small, fun markets, but not reach a broad audience of vendors.  It will bring people into crypto, who will then discover bitcoin.  I don't think it will cannibalize bitcoin.

Good hypothesis, but I'm not actually sure it's bullish news.  If a miner's btc holdings have been converted into ETF funds, the good news is that's a lot of money flowing into bitcoin right now from fiat.  It's also a sign that more Wall St. money will be on the way.  
The bad news is that is a lot of bitcoin that was illiquid and will now be circulating.
ETFs buy and sell on the markets.  When investors want to cycle out of the ETF, those bitcoins will not be sold back to the miner off book -- I don't think anyway! -- but will be sold at Gox/Stamp/BTCchina or whatever.  So new sales are coming to the exchanges, but not new buys.
So it's bullish in one respect and bearish in another.  Short-term, I think it's actually bearish, but good for that miner, and long-term, good for bitcoin too.

Just make a paper wallet for large amounts on bitaddress.org. Make several copies and use BIP-38 encryption with an easy-to-remember password.  Spread the copies of the paper wallets around -- home, office, etc.
Send each paper wallet address a maximum of 5 coins.  Scan the public side of the wallet in blockchain.info and follow your wallets.  When you want to spend your coins, just scan the private key with blockchain and enter your BIP-38 password.  Then your follow-only cold wallet becomes a hot wallet and you can spend with blockchain.
It's not hard.  Takes about 15 minutes to get your coins on paper wallets.
There's no need for 3 kinds of media, loading or running and special software on your computer or anything.

agree completely.  I am worried about the regulatory hammer coming down, though, along with the trolls.
The uptick in price is due to four things, IMO:
1. MtGox was already dragging the market down, at least $300 worth of price drop, before the final news broke.  So most of it was priced in.
2. The loss of all those coins from Gox accounts was deflationary.  It reduced the supply not of real coins, but of coins people thought were available.
3. For those interested in buying coins, Gox is no longer an option, nor is bitcoin builder.  There are no "super cheap" coins anywhere.  So those buyers had to go to the legit exchanges, driving prices up.
4. People like myself felt the panic was an over-reaction, a kind of reverse-bubble, and bought into it.

If there's no exposure to btc, then it could be done simpler within an ecosystem of bitpay / circle just crediting and debiting accounts.  No need to involve the blockchain.
Also, if that's how btc will be used, then no one will need to hold it.  Therefore, there will be almost no demand for the currency.  Velocity will be near infinite, and therefore money supply will be absurdly high, and therefore, bitcoin will be worth next to nothing.

What no one is saying is that increasing the velocity of money is massively inflationary.
One of the main arguments that bitcoin is not worth much is that very little time is needed for, say, remittances, so there's no need to hold onto lots of btc in order to enable it as a payment system.  But a similar point holds for the dollar.  If velocity increases, the value of a dollar decreases:
M*V= P*Q

You can always store coins on your wallet, for each of these currencies.  What we need is easy paper wallets for all of the alts.  Go to BTC-e to make the exchange and scan your private key to trade, then get back into paper wallets.

This was David Woo's methodology too.  I don't think it works.  Remittance business can be completely owned by bitcoin.  But that doesn't mean bitcoin price will go up too much, for instance.  Why not?  Because that service won't require people to hold bitcoins for more than a few seconds, during the two exchanges on either side of the transaction.  So it won't increase the net demand for bitcoins very much at all.  This is a good thing, since the savings from Western Union, etc., will just go directly to the users, rather than holders of bitcoin.  But it shows the methodology is faulty.
On the other hand, if bitcoin replaces some of the investment in gold, that would require that users actually hold it, and that would push the price up.  David Woo is a pretty smart analyst, and I'm surprised he didn't think about this...

You can withdraw bitcoins from Gox, but you cannot withdraw dollars, because they don't have any dollars.
Therefore, to escape Gox, you must convert your dollars to bitcoins.  No one is converting bitcoins to dollars, though.  So the price of bitcoin goes up.
It's a major money-making opportunity for anyone with the ability to cash out.  If you can withdraw cash, you can make a killing by buying btc at Bitstamp and selling for USD.  Maybe Karpales is doing this to line his own pockets.  Surely, he has some cash he can get out personally.

One more vote for localbitcoins.  Meet up with an actual human being in a public place and trade coins for dollars.  That's the quick route.  Meantime, get a coinbase account and get verified.  But that takes some time.
You can't use any reversible form of payment, because bitcoin payments are irreversible, and if you pay in reversible form, you could always reverse the transaction and keep your bitcoin and fiat.

It's not just that we're in a gap... the two roles are fundamentally in tension.  Speculative investments are supposed to grow; currencies are supposed to be dead stable.
Think about how it will play out in time, even in the rosiest scenario.  
1. Bitcoin gains adoption and use --&gt; value rises dramatically.
2. Speculators drawn to the volatility, while currency users put off by it. --&gt; value swings with crazy investor psychology, rumors, etc.
3. Some of the volatility is downwards due to the observation that volatile currencies suck.
4.  Downward volatility puts off savers (store of value users) leading to more downward price movement.
5. Btc is "cheap", so a lot of speculators on the sidelines jump back in, driving the price back up.
6. Weak hands out, the price stabilizes, infrastructure is developed, speculators spend a little to grow the currency, not a lot of trading action.
7. Lack of volatility looks pretty good -- maybe this thing could work! -- and more speculators are back in, thereby introducing volatility, mostly upward, and we're back to step 1.
I'm not sure how the cycle is ever broken.  Speculative investment vehicles are just not stable, and currencies need to be stable.
Maybe it gets *so* big, and so widely distributed that the swings are small enough not to undermine its use as currency?  
Maybe it doesn't matter if it's volatile b/c ordinary users will purchase derivatives to offload the risk onto speculators?  (Inscrypto.)
Maybe it doesn't matter because it will only ever be a payment or remittance system, where btc is held momentarily.

First: You may get some of your money back.  Probably not much of it, but some.  Wouldn't it be tragic if you offed yourself and then Karpeles somehow found his lost private keys or Satoshi stepped in and made everyone whole?
Second: push off the suicide date, whatever it is.  This is not a decision to be rushed, and your mindset might change over time.  Your situation might change over time!  You might struggle to find work, end up doing some things online for a btc startup, which ends up going to the moon.  You just never know.  You may find love.
Third: don't beat yourself up about the paper wallet thing.  What's done is gone.  Joy's soul lies in the doing.  You are not your wealth.  You have a skill set, a life narrative, and relationships.  That's who you are.  If you hadn't ever made money in btc, and simply lost your job, do you think you'd be suicidal?  No.  So, you're in the same position now, only you had a momentary fantasy of wealth.

I am guess she carried a lot of risk during the days / weeks it takes to transfer fiat, and made her money on price movements rather than arbitrage per se.

There wasn't exactly an alternative.  Now there is.  Your argument would work equally well against a system that confirmed instantly and provided perfect dispute resolution.  You're just appealing to the status quo.
Bitpay is 1%, as opposed to 3%.  It is instant and poses no chargeback risks to the seller.  How is this not an improvement?

Well, it was an inconsequential number of coins at the time, and I did email them about what went wrong, what was I missing, but simply received no response whatsoever, not even the boilerplate they send out now.
Gox was trading Magic the Gathering cards, then a bubble brought tens of thousands of investors and then they got hacked.  They were just overwhelmed and my shit fell through the cracks.  But I never wanted to go back.
Now, you don't have to listen to the constant stream of posts here, or even the twitter feed. Just look at the price.  Price does not lie.  How is Gox consistently $100 over stamp??  For all the Gox defenders, explain that.
It's because it makes little sense to sell on Gox when you can't take USD out.  Simple as that.  Otherwise, if Gox is so great, arbitrage the fuck out of the market and get rich.  But if you can't arbitrage then stop defending these incompetent (or worse) assholes and encourage everyone to do business with an exchange where you can actually get money out as  well as put it in.

Actually, the cost is 1.9 billion at the moment: 
Agree that we could see a shift to Litecoin if my scenario played out.  But really, who wants to invest in something subject to double spends if someone really wants it?  Crypto survives, but no one will trust it with their life savings or company's savings if it is subject to this kind of disruption.  Like I said, physics and geology don't have this problem.  Bitcoin is still social, still relies on human beings to be rationally self-interested and not co-ordinate their self-interest in defense of an existing 7 trillion dollar monopoly.  That takes a bit more faith than math, physics, or geology.  It's psychology.

1. They had 5 million USD seized by the Feds.
2. They lost money in hacks.
3. They hinted recently at security problems -- people are speculating that their cold storage has been raided.
They don't have the coins, and they don't have the cash.
Think of it this way:
If they have the coins and the cash, why are they being so shady about everything, moving their office, taking forever on a fix, not doing manual withdrawals, not proving they're solvent by signature, not communicating, etc.?
Why haven't they been allowing timely fiat withdrawals for months?  Why has verification been taking 2 months?
Theirs are not the actions of a solvent exchange.
@_date: 2014-02-23 02:43:07
This is Tyler Cowan's argument.  Bitcoin is deflationary but crypto as a whole is wildly inflationary.  It's an infinite money supply, so long as new coins are created and marketed well.
@_date: 2014-01-09 13:29:56
I agree there are so many other vulnerabilities.  I guess the 51% attack is the scariest, because it goes after the network itself.  
Regulation and taxation can be circumvented or met on the political playing field.  Eventually, the laxer countries will reap economic rewards and force others to follow.  
Computer security can be improved with products like Trezor and the Piper paper wallet generator.  Education should improve too.
Volatility is being addressed with derivatives.  
The encryption itself is pretty secure for the foreseeable future.  
51% is the only long-term worry I have about bitcoin that I can't dismiss.

If the community decides to reverse this theft, if it is a theft, and if it is discovered, then we have democratic (mob?) justice...
What other thefts will be reversed?  Will we eliminate the FBI coins?  I thought the whole point of this currency was that bitcoins are fungible.
What if some of the currency that I have purchased was, say in 2011, stolen from MtGox?  Do I suddenly lose it, even though I paid market price?  Wouldn't the fear of that rollback radically drop the price?  Since God knows many bitcoins have at some point or another been involved in an illegal transaction.  Should I be trading in my bitcoins for freshly minted ones from a miner?  I thought I didn't have to worry about the age of coins when I bought them.

Did you read the documents? They claim 8% of bitcoins are in India. That sounds preposterous to me, but if so, that is not insignificant at all.
I think this is really good news, at least with respect to one agency.
The arguments for India's irrelevance I have seen on this sub are not persuasive:
--Most of India is super poor, lives in rural villages, and doesn't use tech.
So what? There's also a lot of India that is rich, young, urban, and tech savvy. What about them?
Another segment of the population is quickly urbanizing, getting tablets, and to a much greater extent, SMS-capable phones. They're poor, but rich enough to buy phones and motor scooters. Don't tell me bitcoin couldn't be useful to them, not to mention, as enticing a speculative gamble as lottery tickets.
--It's all about the gold in India. Bitcoin will never catch on.
Gold smuggling is a major issue in India. Isn't bitcoin transfer easier than gold smuggling??
--Too many languages are spoken in India for effective mass adoption of a new technology.
Really? Bitcoin can cross linguistic boundaries. Also, India doesn't need to adopt bitcoin en masse in order for bitcoin to be successful there. If it took off just in Bangalore and radiated outward, that could still have profound effects on the development and adoption of the currency worldwide.
In short, I am still bullish on India. Their remittance market is maybe the biggest in the world. At the very least, bitcoin should be eating Western Union's lunch. But that requires a functional way to exchange bitcoins for rupees on the Indian side.

After warning people to get out and being downvoted into oblivion by Gox apologists over the past weeks and months... sorry I have no mercy.  
If you're an early adopter and haven't been trying to get out of Gox for three months, you deserve to lose your coins.
If you sent btc to Gox to sell at an inflated price, knowing they had stopped USD withdrawals, you deserve to lose your money.
I know there are a few innocent victims here, but of all the exchange bankruptcies we've seen, Gox is the most obvious.  Everyone has seen it coming for months, and there was ample evidence of incompetence years ago.
Sorry, but I feel nothing but disgust for Gox customers.  I hope they lose everything and leave btc, even if it drives the price down.  
Do not reward shit businesses with your coins!!!

I also don't think BTC is as secure right now.  For 2.5 billion USD, you could buy 51% of hashing power and execute double spends.  Can you tank gold so easily?
Heck, GHash.io almost has 50% already.  It wouldn't take much... a nefarious actor or two, and bitcoin is corrupted, destroying trust in the currency.  Physics and geology are less secure than math, but bitcoin is more than math.  It's also a social network, and that is not as trustworthy as either physics of geology.
I think the estimates are way too high.  Bitcoin needs to develop, too, not just in user friendliness and security and capacity for high volume, but also, running nodes has to be incentivized as bandwidth requirements increase, centralization must be resisted, etc.  We have a lot of work to do before this is a currency worth anywhere near those valuations.
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:13:19

He has only been negative about bitcoin-related things on two matters.  One is the 51% attack.  He worries about that more than most people here.  So do I.  The other is Gox.  He's written negatively about them for the past couple of weeks.

Here's a scenario.  Chinese regulators cannot kill bitcoin and decide they must.  They simply waltz into all of the bitcoin mining operations and ASIC factories in China and demand their product.  Then they execute 51% attacks, etc.
Here's how much it costs: nothing.
Is it likely?  Don't think so.  But when we argue about the gold supply, that's not the sort of reasoning we engage in.  See what I mean?  We just don't have to worry about those kinds of scenarios.  No government can undermine the credibility of gold for virtually no cost.
Having said that, I am long bitcoin and not so long on gold.  Bitcoin is an amazing payment system.  But Falkvinge-type valuations require it to equal gold's level of security, which it does not yet do.  
Rather than live in denial about that, I suggest we think defensively and work to ensure decentralization and robustness of the network.

I get what you're saying, but their point was actually worth making.  Zero-fee transactions clutter the blockchain and are easily subject to double-spend attacks.  A demonstration like theirs against a dice site served a purpose.
It was also assholish.  But early on in this currency's history, we have to see what bad actors can do, in order to know how secure the network is, and how to make it more secure.  Imagine this was happening for the first time at 100,000 per bitcoin when it's thoroughly enmeshed in world commerce!!

Um... when credit tightens, the most liquid investments rise and everything else falls.  In 2008, everything fell except treasuries: stocks, bonds, housing, gold, oil, pork bellies.  If you think bitcoin would "skyrocket" during a crash, you're saying it would act like treasuries rather than anything else in the economy.  I respectfully disagree.

Why, thank you!  My first tip.
@_date: 2014-01-05 08:57:06
Right.  Volatility risk has to be low enough that saving an additional 1% by taking direct payments seems worthwhile.
My advice to local merchants has been: use BitPay and take 2% of your payments in bitcoin and 98% in USD.  In other words, pocket the savings over visa/mastercard and invest it in bitcoin, since it was money you never had before accepting bitcoin in the first place.
If merchants do this generally, they will be partially "paid in bitcoin" in the currency, not just the payment system.

I hate GHash as much as anyone, and I like your post.  But, as far as their previous double-spend, they were actually making a good point.  Micro-transactions with no fee on a gambling site are not sustainable because they are easily subject to double-spending attacks, and GHash demonstrated that.  I have been freaking out as much as anyone about 51% attacks -- I've written many posts on it, all quickly downvoted to the basement -- but when I looked into this particular double spend, I actually came around the GHash's side.
Don't trust them anyway, though.  I don't trust anyone.  That was supposed to be the whole idea behind bitcoin: no trust required.

It was all buttcoiners in this sub and now, a lot of fun with the Karpales saga, but not a lot of basic questions that we always get in a boom cycle.  
I think a lot of the buying is being done by the same people who are selling, only in different amounts and at different times.  A few whales are unloading, weak hands are folding, and traders are trading.  I don't see a lot of new users though.  Maybe soon, but honestly, I'd rather see btc just drop off the radar for a couple of years and develop quietly.

Imagine there were only one miner.  If the price is staying high only because he's hoarding, he continues to stockpile bitcoins and the "high" price is only an illusion.  He'll have to sell eventually, and when he does, the price will come down by the same amount.
Now, imagine there are many miners.  The first to sell gets the highest price, because the others' selling will drive the price lower (given fixed demand).  So there's an incentive to sell right away.
(And no, speculation and mining are not totally separate.  ROI on mining equipment requires speculation about price over the useful life of the tech.)

Miners are paid in bitcoins.  You have a nice way of putting what a bitcoin is: the right to write to the blockchain.  (And proportionally: a lot of bitcoin means the rights to a large chunk of the blockchain.)  If that right is worth a lot, for whatever reason, it will make sense to mine.  If that right is worthless, it won't make sense to mine.
Now, I suppose the other functions of the blockchain could be so valuable that governments and businesses would mine just for the sake of securing those functions.  That *could* happen!  But is that what Adresessen is talking about?  I doubt it!

The question is whether, when the market rebounds, does it rebound *more* in the first up period, or does it rebound more in later periods.  If it rebounds most in the first up period, you'll miss it.  If it rebounds more in later periods than the first, your strategy is sound.  So, for a given period, you have to make that prediction.  Otherwise your advice is unsound.
For that matter, it may rebound within a period, only to drop immediately thereafter.  Your strategy could be suggesting a buy on the edge of another downturn, missing the entire upswing.  You have to "predict" that that won't happen.  Everyone has to predict something.
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:18:46
There is no way to answer your question:
If the market of sellers dries up, it could go up to $1000 with only $1000 in case.  If everyone decides to dump their btc, it could take a *lot*.  
There is no way to make the calculation without knowing at what price bitcoin holders would sell.
Maintaining the price with freshly minted coins is another matter.

I don't think Andreessen knows what "emergent property" means.  (Then again, I've read him bashing on liberal arts education, so that would include philosophy.)
What's true is that the currency value can fluctuate wildly while the blockchain still has value for many purposes.
What's false is that if the currency drops to very little, that it doesn't effect the other functions of the blockchain.  Of course it does, since there won't be an incentive to mine, and that will make an attack cheaper.  An attack would be disruptive to the other sources of blockchain value.
Simply put, there are just different kinds of value in the blockchain.  One is currency.  There are many others.  They are somewhat independent, but all other functions depend on the network, and the strength and health of the network *does* depend to some degree on the strength of the currency.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:26:19
Just a little suspicious here.
If he's your "friend", why would you pre-announce the sale, so as to spook the price even further downward?
Why is your friend waiting until Thurs / Fri?  In the middle of a crash, if he wants to fund some businesses, he should just sell quickly.
In no case would it make sense for him to hold onto it, while the price is crashing, and signal the market that he's about to dump, and in which denominations he's about to dump, and THEN sell.
Either you're a terrible friend or you're lying.  Which is it?

He admits it's "loose".  What it shows is a decoupling of value.  I do get that.
You could use a very small portion of the blockchain to keep track of the entire stock market.  BTC doesn't have to be super high for that function to take off, because bitcoins are so highly divisible, just as there are so many possible domain names.

They don't mine more coins as prices drop.  Number of new coins mined daily is the same... actually much less, now that it's not profitable to mine.  So blocks will be few and far between.  This could paralyze the network, true.  But it certainly ain't flooding the market with new coins!

When it can drop 15% in the blink of an eye, it makes no sense to hold.  As a payment mechanism only, with fiat on both sides, it's not terribly efficient.  Also, if that's its only use, the *velocity* of bitcoin is going to be incredibly fast, because people hold it only long enough to exchange.  So in effect the money supply is enormous, since velocity is a component of supply.
I was really hoping (still am) that volatility would (will) die down and settle into gold-like levels.  Looks like that won't happen for a long, long, time if ever.
@_date: 2015-01-05 06:07:43
If sellers outnumber buyers at the fixed price, then once the buyers have all bought their coins, some sellers will remain, trying to sell their coins.  Who will step in and buy those coins from the remaining sellers for the fixed price?
If buyers outnumber sellers at the fixed price, when all the sellers are out of coins, some buyers will still want coins.  Who will sell it to them at the fixed price?
Once you have fixed the price, then if sellers outnumber buyers, there will be a glut of coins for sale at that price with no one to buy them.  If buyers outnumber sellers, you'll have a shortage of coins (the sellers will be all sold out).
Econ 101.  In a free market, price is where the supply and demand curve cross.  Go to bitcoinwisdom and look at the order book.  Price is determined by the most extreme values of bid and offer.  Now imagine what would happen if only one price were allowed as a point of exchange!

I think the wheels of the regulation machines around the world have already been set in motion, unfortunately.  The only problem is that bitcoin is not already out ahead and proving its worth and popularity among the people.  This way, when JP Morgan kills it through their government lackeys, no one will care.  I think it's worse, wrt regulation.
I agree about infrastructure, tech, and everything else growing quietly.
And lastly, I have been convinced that some regulation might not be a bad thing.  This sub is scam after scam after scam.  The community has not shown the ability to self-regulate.  People are stupid and need government protection I guess.

3. Price of bitcoin tanks.
4. Bitcoin mining becomes massively unprofitable.
5. 51% attack becomes cheap.
6. Attacks on the bitcoin network disrupt sidechain.
7 ...?
I think we can see ahead in the sequence, and the sidechain would have an interest in either mining at a loss or keeping the value of bitcoin reasonably high.

I want to know why it goes to $10.  If it's a serious problem with the protocol, I may be selling.  If it's just the FUD / Silk Road coins / Bitstamp stolen coins / Butterfly Labs sales to cover customer reimbursement / panic selling then I would buy, and probably would buy more than is rational, as a percentage of my net worth.
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:29:40
The fact that they communicate *like* Gox in a crisis and that they have a good reputation with customer service just makes it worse.  Why would a responsive company suddenly go Karpales?  Maybe the problems are worse than they're letting on, and they're actually in full panic mode.

I've only had great experiences, and in fact met some smart, interesting people. 
Take a few precautions: meet in a bank, for instance, or in a bank branch that's in a local supermarket.  You can print a paper wallet before you go, bring only the public key and check on the blockchain to make sure your payment has gone through.  
I wouldn't do crazy large amounts with unknown people, but find someone who has done some sales and is well rated and do a moderate amount.  Risk isn't absolutely zero, but then again, neither is life.  You could always slip and fall in the shower and  break your neck.

Can you post this in a separate thread? Serious misunderstandings out there on this issue, and it is a serious one for the protocol/currency/network.
@_date: 2015-01-10 06:28:17
Agree completely.  Suppose you need a system for achieving dynamic, distributed consensus.  Why build an entirely new network and then secure it?  If bitcoin isn't still secure enough for you, take some fraction of what you were planning on spending to secure your network and throw it at bitcoin mining, using the blockchain instead.  
Here's another way to think about it: the security on the blockchain that's already being provided is nearly free.  All you need to do is buy up a small chunk of the chain (i.e., some coins).  Given the divisibility of bitcoin, you don't need to buy many coins even for a complex system.  (This fact is not necessarily good for bitcoin price.)
Then if you need more security, add to the power that's already on the network, rather than building a new one.
It's far more efficient to buy some coins and build on the bitcoin network than start your own and secure it.

On how to buy: as everyone has already said, Circle, Coinbase, etc. is one option.  But it depends on whether you like privacy or not.  Those companies track all of your purchases and will flag you if you send money to an address that is associated with "suspicious activity" like gambling or weed.  It's pretty intrusive, but not everyone minds that.
If you value privacy, go through localbitcoins.  You'll pay a little more and it's less convenient, but kind of fun to meet other bitcoin people too.
Now, as for how much to buy and when, my only advice is to dollar cost average in.  Don't buy all at once, particularly right now, while a knife is falling out of the sky, unless you have an extremely high tolerance for risk.
If you buy once a month, for the same amount of fiat currency, you'll get a lot of bitcoins one month and fewer bitcoins another, depending on price.  You run a much smaller risk of buying at a peak (or a dip!).

@_date: 2015-01-16 07:29:17
Now give the compound APR version.  It will be even more spectacular!
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:20:28
I've been waiting forever for mining to become unprofitable.  To me, you have this *big* unknown, which is the bitcoin price.  If price falls, suddenly, you can't pay back the investment on your mining equipment.  So you have to make this very difficult price prediction.  You also need to predict hashing power, and its growth.  Those are extremely difficult predictions to make!
So it's never made sense for me to mine, since I could no longer do it on a graphics card.  If you really believe in price increases, buy some bitcoin.  If you're not sure, then don't buy specialized ASICS!
But yeah, glad to see capitalists learning about risk through the rigors of the market.
I hope bitcoin rebounds and people are more rational in the future, both in terms of investing in mining and also ponzi schemes / frauds / security / etc. 
I hope the community learns from all of our crazy-ass mistakes.  Right now, the beating on bitcoin is worse than what Oregon took from OSU.

In some markets there are people looking to buy that much.  Meet in your bank lobby and make the deposit before leaving.  Security precautions, obviously, will be paramount, but it's doable.

How does the "reporting" work?  What prevents reporters from taking massive positions, then reporting favorable outcomes?  
On Intrade, the comments on many of the bets were filled with controversies over ambiguities in the wording and the outcomes of bets.  Some were clear cut, but many were not.  In those cases, I imagine there will be a side market in bribing reporters.

20% btc purchase
20% mining with renewables
20% massive giveaway
20% startups
20% worldwide lobbying efforts
The 60% giveaway, startup, and lobbying efforts make the 40% btc and mining investments take off.  $200 million in worldwide political donations could do a hell of a lot.  So could $200 million in faucets / givewaways.
$200 million in mining would give you a voice in the future direction of the currency, even if it isn't profitable.
The investment of $400 million ($200 for giveaway purposes) alone would drive the price well up and bolster the whole community.

So, today bter.com is hacked and bitcoin drops $40 in minutes.  Meanwhile, Obama visits Silicon Valley and officially endorses Apple Pay as a way to receive government benefits.
Bitcoin is a long shot.  Doubling in 2 years is way conservative.  It could go 10-fold again easily.  But it could also go to zero.

1. There's no reason not to think of gold itself as a technology.  It's valuable in part because of its utility, and it has been surpassed, as a technology, by cryptocurrencies, which are more divisible and transportable.
2. Bitcoin is an interesting technology, in that it can co-opt innovations of its peers, while preserving its network advantage.  Not all changes can be co-opted, but it has a lot of flexibility in how it responds to the new cryptos.  The new crytpos, on the other hand, have to establish legitimacy.  (Good luck!)

If by "change the world" you mean put you on a par with billionaires for no good reason, then no, bitcoin will not "change the world".  If by "change the world" you mean make transactions more efficient and prevent systematic graft by large institutions who control governments and militaries, then... probably not, but maybe!
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:45:03
Notice I said "whether and how".  Libertarians think efficiency gains shouldn't be redistributed and they want their own private armies.  (I saw this firsthand in S. Africa: armed private security guards in every grocery store parking lot, but no police anywhere.)

For 1.5 billion, you could employ some engineers, build a factory, and take down bitcoin.  If I were a VP at Goldman Sachs, this is what I would propose.  Take out the competition, or at least keep them under the thumb and dominate the mining market for a fucking pittance in global banker money.

If bitcoin is THE currency, that is political.
However, it could be A currency, one among many, without libertarianism suddenly becoming a reality.
Since I think the latter scenario is far more probable, I agree that for most people, btc can be seen as a good thing independent of politics.  Everybody loves efficiency.  We can fight about whether and how to distribute the gains, but I agree with OP: that is a different fight.  Let's focus on the efficiency gains first.

I had that thought too.  Why didn't China just drop the currency controls, rather than open up bitcoin?
Here is my answer: keeping the controls in place forces people into bitcoin.  The flow out of Chinese currency will still be much much slower than if they dropped the controls.  However, this way, Chinese people acquire a lot of btc instead of usd.  That ultimately helps them dominate this new currency, and still keeps their exports affordable in USD.
It could be they are having it both ways: allowing greater economic freedom and prosperity for their citizens, and sticking it to the US.

I heard Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCChina, saying that in China, merchant adoption doesn't matter.  It needs to be valuable as an asset first, in the minds of Chinese people, and then merchants will start accepting it.  They are going the other way: first as an investment, and secondly, as a currency.  
Very interesting.  And it makes sense.  China is a saving nation.  US is consumption-based.  So they think: what is a good mechanism for wealth preservation?  We think: what can buy us cheap shit made in China?

Classic game theoretic problem.  Ghash.io is convenient for miners.  Each miner stands to gain by staying with the pool.  Bitcoin as a whole loses as Ghash approaches 50%: it undermines trust in the currency.  
"What? our currency depends on mining decentralization and there is no mechanism to ensure it's decentralized?  I'm not going to bet 100k that random internet people won't do that!"  Sells btc and buys Treasuries.
Does this worry the miners?  In theory it should, but in practice?  No.  They will go to the pool that is best for themselves in the short term.
Don't believe me?  Look in these comments at the Ghash.io, unconcerned miner.  Or look at the history of centralization of mining.
For those who are talking about forking and switching to scrypt... yes, bitcoin could survive such a move, but imagine the impact on price.
Ghash.io doesn't have to double spend all over the place in order to crash the currency for the foreseeable future.  It only needs to approach 50%, with a proven record of double spends, and some clueless media folk need to figure out what could happen.  
No serious Wall St. money is going to put itself at that kind of risk.  Better to deal with Bernanke's predictable low inflation.
Will we solve the problem?  I don't know.  The Easter Islanders chopped down the last tree.  We show no signs of slowing our carbon production.  Etc.  I'm not terribly optimistic.

Downvote me in to oblivion if you will, but that doesn't make the issue go away.

I don't expect the price to go to $1k.  I expect bitcoin to fail.  But I think it has roughly a 10% chance of succeeding, where "succeeding" means equalling 1% of the USD and then being $10k per btc.  No hope involved.

Right, the worst-case scenario is pretty bad.  It's merely a theoretical possibility, but if we had blocks confirmed at 100 minutes, that would further drive down price, making it even less profitable to mine.  That would cause more miners to drop out temporarily, which would increase confirmation time even more, which would drop the price further, etc.
I suppose, the code could be patched in such a scenario, but it would have to be done in an orderly, agreed-upon way, and only in an emergency.  But that might really destroy the currency, or at least wipe out its price.

They wouldn't get free money from the Fed.  On the whole, it would hurt them, as they currently make their living on the inefficiencies of the transfer system and their monopoly on the money supply.
However, for the FIRST bank to buy, sell, and store bitcoins securely, it could be a major advantage.  The easiest way would be for one of the major banks to simply buy coinbase, and then integrate coinbase with their existing business.
Bitcoin could grow amazingly fast with the vast resources of a single major bank behind it, and their influence in DC.

I have often had this thought.  In fact, I've thought about how to design stabilizing algorithms.  Shouldn't be too hard in a market this small if you have really deep btc and fiat pockets.
If I were a really really big whale, this is what I would do, and in 3 months point to the "stability" as a way of drawing in investors, encouraging acceptance, etc.  
But then, with that success would come a huge rise in price.  The only way to stabilize it would be to sell all of your bitcoins!

You should understand this about trading: the price reflects current sentiment.  Fear and hope about bitcoin are balanced precisely at its price, no higher and no lower.  
When you try to time the market, you think you know better than the sum total of players who are buying, selling, or holding.  Understand that this is a risky proposition.  Understand that when you are wrong, which will probably be 50% of the time, if not more if you're a noob, it is entirely your responsibility.
What are people supposed to do?  Censor themselves so you don't make a poor investment decision?  Really?  Think about what you're asking.  
Some people on here did think it would go to $200.  That was their honest opinion.  Others thought it would shoot back to $1000, and refused to believe the news coming out of China.  On balance, both camps balanced out around the current price.
What is your suggested alternative to people voicing their opinions?
If you go on some personal psychological journey and end up losing money on the basis of trying to outsmart the market, that is on you.  Sorry.
If you want to be a part of bitcoin, then by all means, buy some, spend it, offer goods and services for it, and introduce others to it.  Join the revolution.

Yes of course, but with two caveats.
1. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.  Remember this is speculative and high risk.  Don't complain when it crashes: that was always a likely outcome.
2. Dollar cost average.  Buy the same amount, weekly or monthly, in dollars, over a long period of time.  You will expose yourself to less risk, because as the price drops, you get more btc, and as it rises, you get less but continue to increase your holdings steadily.  Much lower risk investing in this way.

This seems like a flaw in the system.  I mean, theoretically, a crash could kill the network for 2 weeks.

First LiKaShing makes an investment, from HK.  Now, Taiwan takes advantage.  Not saying China is actually getting hurt from this, but you know there is a contingent in the government that is trying to keep bitcoin legal, and they are using this in the internal party debate.

Why are we in a minor pullback right now?  Most of the time, there is no "why".  Or, rather, there are a thousand whys.  The market is the sum of many different forces.  Don't try to generate finance-page headlines for price movements.  With some exceptions -- China news -- it's usually too many motives to capture in a headline.
@_date: 2013-05-21 17:55:06
I really don't understand the argument.  Bitcoin is deflationary, so it becomes so valuable no one wants to spend it.  Therefore, it crashes and becomes worth virtually nothing.  
But wait.  If it is worth virtually nothing, then it's not deflationary, and then people *will* spend it!
But then if they spend it, then, given limited supply, it will go deflationary and no one will spend it again and it will crash and be worth virtually nothing.
Think through the inferences, people!  When you can see what's coming, time gets compressed by our rational anticipation, and the price evens out beforehand.   Jeeez.
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:15:57

Another technique is to sell all mined coins immediately, and also to short the coins through whatever 3-rd parties allow that.  This drops the price of btc, which also causes miners to unplug.
Unfavorable regulation does something similar.

There was actually an economist who worked for the government who delivered bagels to offices like this and kept stats on who paid and who didn't, and when people stole and when people didn't.

I don't think you understand.  It's virtually impossible to make money unless you have very cheap electricity (e.g., you live in Iceland) and own the factory that makes ASIC chips.
If you want to acquire bitcoins, that's easy.  Buy them on one of the markets with cash.  Far easier and more efficient than mining.

Right.  Like he wouldn't have said the other bubbles were "mature"...
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:12:31
The question is why to keep your rigs plugged in and running, when you lose money every hour on electricity.  If your margins are so thin you only make money while btc is over $800 and it drops to $200, you are losing money while mining.  Why not wait until price goes up, or difficulty drops, to resume mining?  
You're still in it for the "long haul" as long as you hold your equipment (and/or your coins).  But that doesn't mean you should mine even when it is costing you money, just out of pure (libertarian?) altruism.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:24:37

You have a multi-trillion-dollar business model threatened by emerging crypto currencies.  The easiest way to protect your business is use government regulation.  The next easiest way is to do a 51% attack.  That costs, what, half a billion at present?  Is it more now?  
A drop in the bucket for all of the interests that are threatened.  Tell me the pool operators would stand firm against a "bribe" of magnitude?  This is a free market.  Nothing would be illegal about the transaction, and it makes perfect sense from both parties' perspectives. 
Why is this stupid?  It seems *rational* to me.
Weird how libertarians get all high-minded when someone suggests a rational trade that makes both parties better off.
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:44:46
Are they cracking down simply because it's bitcoin trade?  Or because they have reason to think there's money laundering.  If it's the former, that is the death knell of bitcoin in India.  If the latter, it's no big deal.  Could as well have been a raid on a small-time cash exchanger.

You've asked a totally general question about every kind of work.  If McDonald's can make money making burgers, why doesn't everyone start up a burger shop?  Except in this business there are very few barriers to entry.
Some people are in first, have the equipment anyway, have cheap or free electricity, etc.  Other people do not, and it makes no sense for them to mine.
Mining also involves taking a risk on the currency itself.  If btc goes to $20, miners will be left high and dry, sitting on their expensive gear.  Calculating ROI based on equipment and electricity is not taking this risk into account.

Great analogy with the internet.  Bitcoin is, fundamentally, a protocol and nothing more.  It's neither inherently good nor evil.
There's really no information here, though, about what the Senate is planning to do, regulation-wise.  This it the single biggest news event in the near future that may dramatically impact the price of bitcoin.  
If sensible regulations come out of DC, the price will skyrocket, and many other countries will follow suit.  If something like Iceland's/China's/Finland's regulations come out, bitcoin will be banished to a tiny fraction of commerce for a long time to come and only true believers will hold.
A purchase of bitcoin today is largely a bet that those regulations will be reasonable.

In the classic setup, the commons is some land to graze sheep.  That's the communal good.  Each sheep farmer is better off over-grazing it, but collectively, everyone is better off if there is limited grazing, so as to keep the commons healthy and producing grass.
Here, the communal good is decentralization of mining.  But concentration of mining benefits individual miners, as they achieve more even payouts and other economies of scale.  So the good of the whole bitcoin community is pitted against the good of individual miners.
Since there is no mechanism to ensure decentralization, whether it happens depends on whether miners can coordinate their interests to stave of disaster.  They're like sheep farmers who, without any mechanism, need to coordinate their interests to preserve the commons.
What's LOL worthy about my analogy?
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:05:14
Disagree.  Riches are not to be made, but bitcoin has a long ways to run if it's to meet it's potential.  Maybe 10x, maybe 100x?  How many investments offer that kind of potential return?  Ever in one's life?

Correct, sir.  This is my  reservation about btc.  If it truly threatens trillion-dollar industries or governments, they can go all out to kill it.  When they add power to the network, the 51% is easier to achieve, because mining becomes unprofitable very quickly.

A "bill pay" type of service on Coinbase would be nice.  Just like you have with an online bank, you would set up a payee, then send them USD from your coinbase account.  Efficiency gained would just be avoiding the ACH transfer back to your own back and then out to the payee.

Well, if bitcoin takes off, it will do the same work that ordinary banking does, but without generating $2 billion per day, gifted to major banks out of nothing.

If it goes to 40K and you bought at 1000, you make 40x your money.  So if there is a 1/40 chance of that outcome, it's a rational bet.
On the other hand, you can only lose 100%.  So even if Mark Williams is right, if you think the probability the Winkelvii are right is greater than 1/40 (less now!) you should still buy, rationally speaking.

$2 billion is getting half of today's hashing power.  I wouldn't need to increase difficulty very much to make mining sorely unprofitable.  It's already unprofitable for most miners!!
I think $80 million in state of the art equipment would push difficulty so high it would be profitable for no one without free power.  Since I am willing to burn $10 million on power, this is not my concern, and I can keep mining and buying up rigs while others fade out.
Long story short, since my motive is not profit by mining, but rather, protection of a $7 trillion monopoly, I can quickly and cheaply get 51% just by pushing us over the difficulty threshold.

Bitcoin is virtually unknown in Korea, but they are one of the most wired countries on the planet.  There's only one fixed rate exchange and only one city shows up on localbitcoins.  Prepare for an influx of another billion or two from Korea, near-term.

Third problem: it's hard to acquire.
Fourth problem: it's volatile.
Fifth problem: confirmations take time.

Primecoin is doing it.

Good point.  And that was certainly true when mining was a bunch of graphics cards.  But now we're talking about dedicated hardware and liquid-cooled farms.  These are for-profit enterprises.  A few more increases in difficulty and it won't matter what the proverbial basement-dwelling neckbeards are doing.  Hashing power of the latest, and super expensive, tech, will make all homebrew work computationally irrelevant.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:06:59
Yes.  If a government or bank wants it to crash, they can easily purchase enough computing power to make it unprofitable for anyone to mine, then 51% attack will be easy.

This is good news in 3, 2, 1...

Just marveling, again, at your ability to lose money in the greatest bull market since tulips (and without short selling!!).  Congratulations on an *incredibly* unlucky sequence of choices.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:01:06
omg. stop please.

"one of the most important technical innovations of our time"
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:09:20
The threat of a 51% attack will eventually fit into the economics of bitcoin.  As profits from mining drop, fewer people mine, and an enemy of bitcoin can more easily grab 51% and wreak havoc.  When mining is not very profitable, it will only be attractive to enemies of the currency, who can cheaply wipe it out.
People will flee to other alts that are not suffering from the same crisis at the time.

no doubt.

Please, please, please post again when you are going to buy or sell.  You are a reliable counter-indicator.  I will do the opposite.
As others are saying here, you've got to set aside your sister's half.  You should never have put all the eggs in the btc basket.  That's irresponsible and not diversified.  And going forward, DO NOT GAMBLE to make up your loss and repeatedly go double or nothing. Decide on a percentage to bet on btc, buy and hold, and when your holdings go far above your percentage allocated, sell the btc and buy more equities and bonds.
Seriously.  Diversify!!!
Then again, you might want to go to Vegas and bet it all on black, and if you win, do it again, up to 3 times, and never tell your sister anything.  Roughly .5*.5*.5 chance you'll never have to come clean.
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:16:58
Yes!  Compare: I didn't get sick this year so I shouldn't have bought health insurance.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:17:41
But is the hearing good or bad?  I see how it could trigger people either way.  So I have no idea who is reacting!
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:30:25
I know someone else who's had the problem too.  It's one minor glitch, nothing serious.  But if you're going to do a sale, you'd better bring a smartphone and be able to use the browser, as 2d9 did.  You can release the funds, but you cannot view the SMS code.
They need to get onto this.  Please upvote.  Localbitcoins is a really important site.

Yeah, everything in China is cool:

Of course I feel bad for the parties involved.  However, this is a good thing for bitcoin.  These arrests were made without the help of additional regulation, proving to governments that bitcoin does not put one above the law. 
 Just as the original Silk Road bust was positive, so is this.

Just finished reading it e-cover-to-e-cover.  Nothing new to me, in principle, but I appreciate the step by step instructions, particularly in ch. 6.
As the author says, hopefully the book will be obsolete, because I still can't imagine my parents or grandparents actually going through this book and getting it.  But it could save a lot of people a lot of money.
One option that's left out, and the option I use: paper wallets with BIP38, but many, with smallish amounts in each.  When you want to use them, scan into your blockchain.info wallet with 2FA.  Each wallet has only an amount you wouldn't freak out about losing.
That makes paper wallets not much of a hassle at all.

Overstated and wrong on micro-payment.  1/10 of a cent?  Not anymore.
But if it makes people buy, maybe I'm ok with that?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:01:50
Edit: love how everyone downvoted the truth into oblivion.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:38:05
Exactly.  Aren't there bitcoin derivative products?  I'll take the other side of that bet (at the right odds).
