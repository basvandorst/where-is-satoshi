Probably because your idiot son shouldn't be going to college in the first place.
You know that thing with the collective intelligence of humanity that's currently in your hand? USE IT.

Whoa whoa whoa...wait a minute.
You're traveling through Latin America, which has many countries with sky high kidnapping rates, in a fucking van marked with a currency that can be stolen from you with ease?
Excuse me, but what?
You're riding around in a MONEY BUS wearing a sign that says "BEFRIEND ME...TAKE ME SOMEWHERE QUIET...AND PUT A GUN TO MY FRIENDS HEAD AND TAKE OUR SHIT, PLEASE!".

It is actually fake news much of the time.
And I don't even like Trump.

So YOU'RE the one I dumped all my LTC on. Why thank you.

It does?
All I see is normal fluctuations in price. Historically, these fluctuations are actually kinda tame.
I suspect you came to Bitcoin with the wrong expectations. It's not a vehicle for you brag to your friends about how rich you are now.

Imagine fake passports. Pricey, but possible.
Literally could have orchestrated the whole thing under someone elses identity.

You're recommending Coinomi?
Uhhh, what?

Because a white guy terrified of offending people because of the SJW brigade made the meme.
As a black man, I'll say it as god intended..
@_date: 2019-12-13 05:51:22
No, really. It makes me bullish.
You must be new.
@_date: 2019-12-09 06:47:27
Another whitey trying not to offend the "people of color".
JUST SAY "BLACK PEOPLE" LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE YOU PATRONIZING FUCKS.

You have any idea how many people in this world WOULD MURDER YOU IN YOUR SLEEP to be able to live in America?
Gotta love how the ONLY people on the planet that bitch about AWWWW HOW HARD IT IS IN AMERICA are American born crybabies with zero experience with the world outside their borders.
Ever lived abroad in a developing nation? I do currently and have for years. The experience has taught me something valuable...America *IS* fucking great. Is it perfect? Not even close...but my god you have no idea how ugly this world can get.
Quit your spoiled crybaby OHHHH BUT COLLEGE IS TOO EXPENSIVEEEEEE bullshit. There are billions of people in this world that would KILL YOU to have your opportunities. Just shut the fuck up and get a goddamn passport, loser.
