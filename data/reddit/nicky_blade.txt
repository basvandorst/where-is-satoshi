I don't think so, friend. It's not tough to calculate the length of a mine's existence and how much it "should" be worth... I don't think the Chinese gov't cares much about the "but we already converted it into yuan and distributed it" excuse. The amount you hand over could be directly proportional to the length of your prison sentence. 
Look, it's simply not as secure as you want it to be. In a world with bad actors, bad acts happen.

Same reason Kings have needed them throughout history... They have so much to lose, they obsess over staying in their top position. They will do anything and consider any point of view to stay in power. Which is simultaneously a negative and a positive. On the luck that the astrologers are right, they've got the edge. On the off that their wrong, they've got bets hedged every other which way.

Re: Irrational Exuberance:
Greenspan is of the old school of thought that the market actors are rational and instances of irrational behavior bring ruin. The new school behavioral economists (Kahneman et. al) suggest a much different reality: humans in the marketplace are *always* irrational.
Re: Nothing Special about Bitcoin:
My old Magic the Gathering cards are worth thousands and thousands of dollars. And I can actually sell them for a profit of something ridiculous like 1000%. 
Is MTG an objectively better game than other card games? No, but it's one a shit ton of people want/agree is valuable. And because there is a limited supply of the cards in print, and Wizards of the Coast does a good job of anticipating supply/demand, they store value.
By your logic, people would eventually print their own cards from art on the internet and play the game for free! And yet, there is a global marketplace for trading and selling these cards at ridiculous values, despite "Nothing" really being special about it that isn't subjective.
Bitcoin will go up in value BECAUSE millennials approve of it, not in spite of it. It will not crash because they overvalue it, rather it will carry whatever value is assigned to it... just like my Magic cards.
See you at $500k BTC.

Network will get faster, fees will get lower. As technology improves, it costs less to do the same. The growth of technology will outpace the energy cost of BTC, even as the market cap increases. The trade-off will be that the mining gets even *more* centralized in companies seeking to establish themselves as major players in the "cryptocurrency industry."

"Simply 6 Minute And 44 Second Explanation" wouldn't quite have had the same ring to it.

In your attempt to belittle a stranger, you misunderstood him. 
I'm saying we should agree on what terminology means, or it will be impossible to have a conversation. Bear Market means what Bear Market means. If Bear Market means multiple things, communication is broken.

Stop saying "we."

Definitely not yet, buddy. Slow your roll. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 06:07:01
Time will tell.

Sell My Tron. Got it! Thanks!
