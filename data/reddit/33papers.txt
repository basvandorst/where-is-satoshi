Why is most of Africa always unknown in these things? It's not the 19th century

Thanks, bought 100k!

Gold isn't valuable because it's useful. It's valuable because it's rare and humanity has assigned value to it. It's one of the least useful metals.

That's 1000% more profit than I've made investing in crypto. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 12:22:32
At least 6k has been tested as the bottom now. Over and over again.

Some of the best I've seen.

The treasure of Sierra madre. Nice.

Yes but when you pay a vendor with a visa or mastercard the payment is as good as instant (even though it actually isn't). Bitcoin can take 40 minutes.

lol why did he say that? Seems pretty dumb.
Edit: oooh it's the windows fundamentalist guy

Bitcoin is deflationary.
The new economic model is earning money by not spending it. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 16:47:08
I agree that as soon as the blocks start confirming it's good enough for me, but it needs to be good enough for businesses.

Why is using batteries the worst thing you can do?

I am heavily invested in crypto.
But the revolut banking app allows you to make free international transfers. It can take a few days and isn't 100% reliable, however.

Me: Buy at ATH after reading about bitcoin in 2010.
Don't be me. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 10:05:15
Transaction times for bitcoin are a major problem. It's already had the brand recognition, people need to be able to pay with it at the speed fiat appears to have. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 10:08:02
Revolut works quite well and is free. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 12:28:23
Some fair points but the reality is we need to cut C02 emissions as fast as we can. 
It's not an ideal situation, clearly. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:34:15
Hahahaha this is me. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 16:32:08
Why not just sell it on GDAX?
@_date: 2018-06-27 11:16:42
Ahahahha I bought in January
@_date: 2019-04-05 19:34:35
Yeah It's likely to go down. When goes up parabolic on a HTF it's a good time to look at going short. I thought this sort of stuff was fairly common knowledge?
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:56:12
Yes. Look at a chart, at very least don't buy the top of a pump. Why would you just buy blindly?
@_date: 2019-04-05 17:12:43
When the price has shown a huge parabolic curve upwards it's very unlikely to continue indefinitely. 
Especially on higher timeframes. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 17:34:43
Well no because the chart had retraced from the previous ATH. 
Nothing goes up indefinitely without retracing.

TA does work but normally just on probability in the short/ medium term when certain things happen. No trader knows what will happen in the long term.
TA traders can make great profits but rarely know what the market will do in a month or a year.

How do these work? How are the bitcoins stored when you buy them?
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:01:18
Wow those dudes must be rich af.
