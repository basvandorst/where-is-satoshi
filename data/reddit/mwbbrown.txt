Depends what you mean by "safe" 
Coinbase is a reputable company and will provide you the bitcoin you buy at the stated price. 
After that it gets a bit murky. You now need to keep that bitcoin safe. Anyone who gets a hold of your private key can spend it and there is NO way to get it back. If the credit card company or your bank mess up they can usually "undo" just about anything, but not with bitcoin. 
Now, your newly purchased BTC at coinbase is in their wallet being held for you, so you have to depend on them protecting it. And they will do a pretty good job, but if they mess up you are screwed. If coinbase goes out of business or the CFO steals all the money you are screwed. There is no FDIC insurance(like we have for banks in the USA) for bitcoin. It's perfectly possible that they will go under and you could lose your bitcoin if they hold it for you.
Most people will recommend that you create your own bitcoin wallet and then have your newly purchased bitcoin transferred it it. That is what I did. 
Now you have the same problem, but you need to make sure YOU keep your wallet keys safe. This not only means against hackers, but from data loss like a failed computer, failed USB drive or fire at your house. There is a link in the sidebar over there ----&gt; to help you. 
good luck.

is right, it is so improbable that it is practically impossible for two random seeds to be generated. However there are(where?) tools that let you pick your own seed, and some people thought they would be cute and pick some sort of funny phrase or dictionary word. They where easily guessable.

I'm trying to figure out if this says more about paypal than Bitcoin. It sounds like you had to use two processors and wait hours for a transaction to complete even after paying a fee and you still think it's better than paypal.  :)

Do you want a truly free market to have a Rand style wet dream or do you want a secure, reliable and stable currency? If the value of a currency is to to allow a free exchange of wealth for goods or services you want the later. 
The only free market action here should be people bailing on MtGox.

Bitcoin users need to understand this point very well. The entire structure of the western monetary system is built with rules, regulations and oversight built out of a thousand years of experience with greed. Bitcoin has to build in the best of these rules otherwise you're small fish in a large pond and will get eaten.

I know, it's basically begging.
