Having read the article, I interpret it rather differently than you. It reads as if buying "Microsoft Bucks" with bitcoin is actually the thing that is coming to an end, and that buying directly with bitcoin was never an option.
To verify it, I guess you could just poke around the MS store and see where/if they accept bitcoin anywhere. The main thing we won't be able to determine by doing so is why this happened (though we can certainly guess), or for how long. I'm not sure I'd expect support staff to have the info to answer that question, and would rather see a blog post from a MS engineer or something of that sort.
Digital assets like Steam Games and Microsoft software is the mainstream use case that bitcoin can try to lay claim to, aside from a highly volatile store of value and daytrader's dream. If LN and side chains don't re-enable that use case *within the year*, I think we're done here.

I mean, how can you stop it though? Bitcoin is a victim of its own popularity. It has its annoying moments (well... lots of them), but this is going to happen to any crypto that becomes popular.

I think you're making the mistake of thinking that funds in LN are "locked" and somehow less real or less spendable as a result. But the opposite is going to be (eventually) true. Once your channel is open, those bitcoins become considerably more liquid *within the lightning network*, regardless of whether you close the channel. You won't be able to send them through the base layer until you close the channel, but it seems the idea is that this will be an infrequent need.
The comparison to a chequing account isn't terrible. Once you move money from savings to chequing, it is *more* liquid.
Sure, there's a small chicken and egg problem for low-value channels, but enthusiasts and higher value channels will get the ball rolling. It's already begun - even though LN devs are warning people that it's not yet safe to use on main yet, people are doing so because they're huge nerds (and I use that word in an endearing way).

I remember once having about 300 ETH in a wallet I made when I was debating diversifying my crypto holdings back when ETH was almost brand new. I don't remember what this cost me or even exactly when I did this, which is good. Makes it hard to put my fuck-up into exact numbers. Funny, though, I think of this seldomly, and mostly just laugh when I do. I guess I missed the boat with bitcoin too, really... bought in much later than I could have. Oh well.

I think Ethereum is at a similar stage, yeah. They released a subset of the full product (uRaiden) to mainnet a while back, which IMO was mostly a publicity stunt so they could claim to be first out the door, but maybe I'm just being cynical.

S2X would have defeated itself in the end, due to a off-by-one bug that would have prevented proper activation.
Now imagine if the community *had* adopted it? Bitcoin would have seized up and required an emergency patch, and it might have caused a massive bear market. I mean it was literally a system-breaking bug. No blocks would have been processed at all until fixed.
And this bug wasn't discovered until a few holdouts decided to run S2X anyway, despite the lack of consensus. It was caught in production, after it had occurred. Obviously the fork was never actually tested in the first place.
That's what you get when you have a tiny team of "cowboys" doing the work on a tight schedule. Even Satoshi himself could screw up some mundane detail like that. It's a mistake anyone can make, and it's why bitcoin dev requires an extensive and time consuming peer review and testing process. It may seem inefficient, but it'll save people's asses.

Bitcoin transactions are smart contracts as well. The difference is in the degree of sandboxing. Bitcoin is very sandboxed and relatively simple, which provides fewer hiding places for security holes in the base layer. Bitcoin is easier to maintain, test, and debug because of this relative simplicity. That comes at the cost of flexibility in the base layer. More risky operations require 2nd layers, whose failure would not compromise the security of Bitcoin's base layer.
Some devs are working on Bitcoin-pegged side chains (Rootstock) that will implement an Ethereum-style VM, for those who need that functionality. Side chains in general (if they can be made secure and trustless) will revolutionize cryptocurrency, and will pretty much give the first mover towards side chains a possible victory over all other cryptos. This is because side chains allow you to create entirely new cryptos, with totally different rules, yet peg them all to a single parent crypto.
The push to make sidechains a reality for Bitcoin is reasonably strong, and the base layer now provides all the necessary pieces, so this is now in the hands of third party development teams. But we're a ways away from that. Until we get there, Ethereum has distinct advantages in smart contracts over bitcoin, while bitcoin has a simpler, easier to audit foundation that provides more peace of mind.
What this all boils down to is that Bitcoin and Ethereum will co-exist for the foreseeable future. IMO, being a maximalist is an even riskier bet than buying into cryptocurrency in the first place.

Having worked for a few web dev shops, I've seen stuff like that happen before. Everything gets prioritized, critical bugs or the CEOs pet idea get priority. If your team is small, you may barely have enough manpower to keep on top of the high priority jobs. Medium to low priority can literally sit there forever. If they are making a lot of money, they may not consider transaction batching and SegWit high priority.

I believe you need to run a LN node on a full node, otherwise you can't really verify the LN transactions. All LN transactions need to be verified against confirmed transactions on the blockchain, and it may be risky to try to do that with a client that hands that verification off to a 3rd party.

Absolutely nothing. Same thing that caused most of the meteoric rise.
Bitcoin has real, intrinsic value as a technology, but in my experience a huge chunk of the market is buying it purely as a speculative investment and are banking on bubble boom/bust cycles.

Bubbles are inflated and popped by people who don't have a clue what they're buying, and who react not to fundamentals and legitimate news, but to emotion and rumor.

So what? $10k transactions have be reported in N.A. as well. Doesn't stop a soul.
If someone hadn't figured it out by now, the markets would be totally divorced from each other, not just slightly offset. You might be underestimating the hoops that folks will jump through to exploit large enough price differences between exchanges.
Even if you can't send fiat itself between exchanges, all you need to do is find an altcoin whose price is similar between exchanges to use as in intermediate to exploit price differences on other altcoins/bitcoins.

If LN is massively adopted it will give bitcoin a utility it hasn't had in years, and greatly increase demand for limited block space. We'll likely need larger blocks to bootstrap even larger lightning networks. LN still needs to commit transactions to the blockchain, after all.

A meme I can truly relate to. A coworker asked me if I've heard about bitcoin and if she should buy. I didn't tell her I'd been nearly obsessively reading about it for several years, and basically just offered some vague "learn about it before you buy" and "it could go to $0 or $1,000,000" type of advice.

I don't actively participate in I'm on your side when it comes to that sub. Too steeped in conspiracy theory and personal attacks for my taste. And I wish this sub would feature less of the same.
I've been a member of this sub since November 2013, under numerous user accounts. Not because I've been banned, but because I delete my accounts every 1 to 2 years [for privacy reasons](
With my present account, I've rallied for SegWit, tried to counter the lies Ver spouts, and enthusiastically followed developments in LN, side chains, MAST, and Schnorr signatures. I've even succumb to the us-vs-them temptation and joined in the crowds scolding Jihan for setting SegWit back to keep ASICBoost alive - or at least that was the theory. So I get it, but you need to chill.

You pull this move on a lot of people who I really don't think deserve it. And for those who do, you're not going to change their minds. Maybe you should consider a different strategy.
My recent pessimism about Bitcoin is not coming from It's coming from observing that the technology I spent an entire year waiting to activate, hoping that it would fix Bitcoin's scaling issues, has had very little noticeable impact, and sits at 10% adoption despite all the good it can do. Meanwhile, dozens of cryptos have been built from the ground up to more directly tackle the scaling problems that bitcoin more or less ignored until now. They have an edge over us because their solutions can afford to be more drastic, not opt-in. ETH did willy-nilly hard fork to undo the whole DAO mess, but they've put together a roadmap that fosters a culture of drastic change. That allows them a luxury of rapid innovation and makes things like the DAO "fix" less objectionable to their community. It's a different culture and it has its pros and cons. I don't know if ETH will be the one to take over, but I'm increasingly thinking *something* will.

He's only talking about storing *block headers* there, by the way.
Also, Moore's law doesn't apply to storage. Even Kryder's law, which is the proper law to invoke, no longer holds. Storage innovation has transitioned to SSDs which are much smaller in capacity, but much faster, than HDs. Now we're all waiting for major breakthroughs in holographic storage and universal memory but they always seem to be 10 years away.
Satoshi was clearly genius in many ways, but in the beginning he kind of sidestepped the scaling problems by making optimistic assumptions about technological innovation. Later, this gave way to his suspicions that nodes would probably no longer be possible to run on simple hardware in the future.
But it does seem like there's a middle ground in reach, with somewhat larger blocks supporting a lot of 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc layers. I often wonder what Satoshi would think of that, but in many ways it doesn't matter that much anymore - open source development allows many options to be tried simultaneously.
Reading should not stop with the whitepaper. Bitcoin has changed a lot since. So have the assumptions. It is no longer safe to assume storage innovation will keep up with Bitcoin as it currently exists. Additionally, you should read more about P2SH, SegWit, Opt-in RBF, and proposed future technologies such as Schnorr signatures, side chains, lightning networks, confidential transactions. If that kind of stuff doesn't get you excited for bitcoin's future, nothing will.
It's also worth looking at what other cryptos are doing. Those that are successful may find compatible solutions ported to bitcoin and many other cryptos.
It's always a good thing to understand what you are buying. And this "Eternal September" we're experiencing these days makes it very clear that a lot of people are buying in without having done their research.

Agreed, but it has a community that still rallies very strongly behind the main dev team, which takes relatively substantial risks (in terms of drastic changes to the software) compared to bitcoin development. They've proposed numerous hard forks, and so long as they'd had good reasons and explained things well, the community just went along with it. This is what bitcoin would have if Satoshi were still around, but it certainly comes with drawbacks. A dev team that has a personality cult surrounding it is a point of centralization and possible failure. Still, I've got half of my holdings in Eth mainly because they're making an effort to innovate when it comes to solving the blockchain's scaling issue. It will be very interesting to see where all of this goes.
I hope that the scaling issues with blockchain technology can be solved. If not, then I guess I'll have to start looking more carefully at IOTA, despite my misgivings.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:36:38
Ethereum's near-term scaling plans are exactly the same as Bitcoin's, they just call them different things. Raiden = LN. Plasma = side chains.
The dev teams working on these solutions might as well be the same. They will borrow ideas from each other. And that's how open source should be. Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely to solve their scaling problems in near identical ways, and nearly simultaneously.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:56:30
At first it seems a bit surprising that in the full year (or more) between SegWit being 100% ready to go and it actually activating, nobody bothered to integrate it fully into the reference client and GUI.
The core devs are obviously undermanned. Given that it's volunteer effort, that's not that surprising, just a somewhat unfortunate trade-off for that decentralization.
Does bitcoin core have a dedicated front-end dev? Might be something for those front-end devs out there to consider...

Even if you get your hands on the old software that let you GPU mine, it's all for nothing.
Bitcoin's difficulty is so insanely high that you need extreme hashrate to make the minimum payout thresholds for mining pools. And if you try to solo mine, you will be lucky to get a single block in your lifetime.
Bitmain and Jihan are scummy, but their product has stood the test of the time. Until Dragonmint comes out (which is likely to still have a closed-source ASIC) you really don't have any other choices.
Anyway, you might find something interesting [here]( But if you don't have a couple hundred GPUs you can forget about it. And they'll never pay for themselves. BFGMiner is probably the closest to what you want. Open source and written by a bitcoin core dev.
Besides, bitcoin mining always relied on closed-source hardware - what do you think that CPU or GPU is exactly? Intel, AMD, and Nvidia aren't exactly bastions of open source hardware.

Yeah, you're right. SegWit is more of an enabler of scaling, as opposed to scaling solution in itself. The slightly increased on-chain capacity it brings was only meant to be a stopgap measure.
Similarly, improvements that trim small amounts of fat from the blockchain are less interesting on their own than they are as multiplicative improvements to added layers.

Well, that's exactly what you'd expect when high fees have driven all low-value transactions out of use: lots of high-value transactions that make the fees look less ridiculous.
I mean, I just paid $11 equivalent on a *SegWit transaction*. So it's not fixed, and doesn't look like it will be fixed any time soon. Not even a moderate block size increase (which SegWit is) will fix this, and very large block size increases are beyond reasonable.

Hardcore bitcoiners would probably be happier with Litecoin taking over than literally any other altcoin. Of all the altcoins, it is the one that has attained the status of "bitcoin's little brother", or "the silver to bitcoin's gold". And Charlie Lee is one of the few altcoin lead dev personalities who doesn't shit all over bitcoin at every opportunity.
So, if bitcoin looks to fail, bitcoiners who wish to remain in cryptocurrency are likely to be reasonably friendly towards the option of Litecoin.
Unfortunately, if bitcoin can't do the job, Litecoin probably can't either. Although it has several times the transaction throughput in theory, its technology is fundamentally the same and will fail for the same reasons under load. To solve scaling, we need something unconventional. Not larger blocks. Not shorter block times. That's why LN, side chains, and even ETH's crazy Sharding idea are probably the only promising games in town.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:54:05
Except unlike regular users of bitcoin, Miners get a block subsidy which is a lump-sum payment on top of any fees included in a block. In times of low fees, this block subsidy is the predominant source of income.
So when fees are very low, the opportunity cost of miners filling up their blocks with "spam" is reasonably low. And if their efforts increase fees so that a few subsequent blocks more than make up for it, it's worth it.
However this is all seems to me to be one hell of a conspiracy theory, which is why I talk about the *potential* for spam. I'm not entirely convinced that spam attacks have been more than a fleeting thing.
I'm more inclined to believe that most of the fee pressure comes from exchanges too lazy to batch transactions and use segwit.
But there are some interesting things to note:
- Miners still mine empty blocks or blocks containing very few transactions (see Bitmain). Clearly, they care rather little for the fees versus other concerns, some of which might be sheer laziness to change their systems.
- Exchanges continue to pay exorbitant fees with horribly inefficient, non-batched, non-Segwit transactions. Apparently they are making so much money that the fees are pocket change to them, otherwise they'd be bankrupt by now.
The conclusion is that the financial incentives put in place by fees don't always work, and for some groups even under high-fee conditions, transactions can be "spammed" without sinking their bank account.

I think people have it wrong. The goal isn't to clog the network, the goal is to game fee estimation in clients that look at recent blocks in order to vastly increase mining profit from fees. Many wallets offer very little control over fees and set fees by basically looking to see what everyone else is doing. This can allow miners to raise fees by mining their own high-fee transaction, then allowing the ensuing feedback loop to keep the high fees going for a while after.
I an not sure if an automated fee estimation method exists yet to stop this from happening.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:10:03
It's almost surreal. Segwit was very well tested and went live on production months ago, but has barely been adopted. Meanwhile, we already have 200 nodes for a brand new network that is still in alpha and has a long list of bugs waiting to be fixed, with devs warning people not to risk their funds on mainnet.
Not that I'm complaining. The enthusiasm of these folks for this promising new network reminds me of the pre-Goxing euphoria where people more optimistic about bitcoin as a form of money.
It's nice to see that bitcoin may just begin to scale up after all. Now what would really make my year is if a non-federated 2-way peg and sidechain system gets invented and adopted soonish. That would be the last necessary piece of the scaling puzzle.
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:37:20
Hard to say about Monero. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are on-track for making Monero eventually obsolete. Both have theoretical solutions for relatively efficient anonymous transactions. At the moment bitcoin is in the lead as a cryptocurrency, and ethereum is in the lead as a computing platform. But this can all change.
I think the scaling issue is really at the center of this all, and is an outright existential risk not just for bitcoin but for ALL cryptos based around the blockchain concept. Some will just have a bit more time to brace for impact than others. 
If bitcoin doesn't fix its scaling issues, it will become just a ticker symbol on exchanges that people can trade against, with no fundamental use cases beyond that. We're so very close to that point already. If Ethereum doesn't do likewise, it will never be able to support complex dApps - it's either purpose for existing (at least until the ICO mania got everyone distracted).
The main cause of the scaling problem is that adding new nodes to an already well-established blockchain-based p2p network does not improve performance. It only adds redundancy. This is what side chains, lightning, and Ethereum's sharding concepts all seek to address, some more direct than others.
Either this problem is solved, or every single blockchain-based cryptocurrency will fail to live up to the hype.

Consolidating UTXOs is a good thing, though, in the long term.
What you're pointing out is really that adoption will increase to take advantage of lower fees until some new equilibrium is reached. However, that equilibrium point is still likely to be lower than before.
But LN may take so long to go mainstream that we won't be able to identify a clear "before" and "after" period with an equally clear event separating them.

They plan to implement a trustless 2-way peg instead of the federation once such a thing exists, so yeah. If they don't, someone else will - once the release they code, once the network exists, it's out of their hands.

Your understanding of Bitcoin's history is a bit flawed...
- You seem to be speaking of the *Hong Kong* agreement.
- Core devs are unable to make promises on behalf of the rest, and only a few devs were present.
- The devs present did in fact do the work they promised to do. But they couldn't force it on the rest of the team so it went nowhere.
- The NY agreement did not include any core devs.
The only way to get Bitcoin core devs to do something is for near-unanimous agreement among them that the BIP should be implemented. Having three guys at your meeting say they'll work on something gets you only part of the way there (to the BIP), but they can't promise the BIP will ever be implemented.

Maybe I am indeed underestimating the difficulty here, but being at a premium is not the same as being an entirely different market. The markets still follow each other, and if Korea's market tanks, so will ours. If our market tanks, so will theirs.
The fact all that major altcoins are at similar levels of premium seems to be evidence that arbitrage is occurring. Without arbitrage the markets would be less consistently different.
But I will defer to you for the most part. I certainly don't have direct experience with this situation.

The trick is, actually following through with that strategy requires doing the opposite of what emotion tells you. Market crashing? Shit, better sell = selling low. Market rising? Shit, better buy = buying high.
That's why hodling is so popular. It's a better strategy than resorting to emotion *as long as* you believe in the long-term outlook of bitcoin.
Some might say using RSI, MACD, and other indicators is even better... but I'm not sure. I made some good trades doing that, and some bad ones. Felt a hell of a lot like playing roulette to be honest. But maybe using the right tools means that instead of the house having a slight edge, the edge becomes yours. So perhaps lots of careful trades over the long term can indeed beat the market... as long as you practice Vulcan Kolinahr or something.

This is why Microsoft wants to get us all on Windows 10 with forced updates, I guess.
Now, with bitcoin exchanges, it's like they're mainframes running unpatched OSes. The end user isn't responsible for upgrading in most cases, but Coinbase/GDAX could make a huge difference.
And I think they will, eventually. It's in their financial interests to do so. GDAX pays the fee for the user, so they'd save probably a lot of money by making those fees smaller.
But they also have a CEO who thinks nobody wants SegWit, so who knows.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:27:01
To be fair, that's *exactly* what was promised, on THIS sub, often and repeatedly, before bitcoin became as popular as it is now. Microtransactions (and not so microtransactions as well), perpetual cloud storage of information, using it to enable smart contracts for legal agreements and exchange of physical assets, cheap international remittance... people were brainstorming use cases left and right. The only thing that really ended the euphoria was MtGox collapsing, and we haven't seen that kind of euphoria since.
When SegWit was announced, it seems we all assumed it would activate MUCH sooner than it did (at least a year sooner), gain mass adoption very quickly, and that would be that. This sub didn't seem to start its collective hand-wringing until after miners began withholding SegWit activation in an effort to push through their own pet forks.

The LN will absolutely contain big hubs, that's inevitable. But it will also contain hobby hubs, and an interesting, not-so-often talked about side-effect of LN is that it incentivizes running full nodes.
So while I think it will contain some degree of centralization, it'll may actually be far less centralized than mining in the end.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:45:44
The big pockets haven't gotten rid of the technically-minded people who continue to work on it. What they've accomplished is distracting us all with boom &amp; bust cycles, and burying technical news under pages and pages of price speculation. But it's all still happening just as before.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:50:55
To use LN, you must use SegWit (which is currently barely used), so if LN gains adoption we'll see an approximately 2x effective increase in block size as LN "forces" SegWit adoption.
SegWit transactions themselves have a smaller effect size (technically, a block weight), and thus cost less than an equivalent non-segwit transaction even when the sat/byte fee rate is the same. A 400 sat/byte transaction I made the other day cost me effectively $11. Not cheap by any means, but an improvement. Now if SegWit adoption was actually increasing, we might not have a full mempool in the first place, and I might have gotten away with 50 sat/byte or less.
Also, you only need 2 on-chain transactions in LN, one to open, one to close. Some time ago there was discussion of intermittent "anti-fraud proofs" that could take place between opening and closing but I don't know if those are necessary anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:10:55
Or the solution, depending on your point of view.
Soft forks may be opt-in, and may slow the rate of adoption considerably, but they're done for a reason. LN is of course neither hard or soft fork, it simply relies on a soft fork to function. Even if SegWit were a hard fork, LN would still be an opt-in technology. It's a 2nd layer, so it must be.

I don't think being physically in Korea will help you, to be honest.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:58:45
Actually, you only need two hubs and a single channel to make LN very useful.
Coinbase and Bitpay. Channel between them. That's a huge proportion of the merchant adoption of bitcoin at the moment.
People are afraid of LN's possible centralization, but all it's going to do is show us the centralization that already exists. And IMO make it better in the long term.
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:41:47
You should use a SegWit transaction to open the channel, so you'll get a fee discount. You can also strategically wait for a weekendd, when fees tend to plummet. Between those two strategies you might be able to get the fee down to $5 or less.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:34:54
I agree, decentralization is important. Maybe side chains can give us the best of both worlds. But if not, technological  improvements will eventually permit a block size increase with no centralization risk. Some would argue we're already there for a small increase. After all, SegWit is going to bring all block data to between 2 and 4 MB if it gets 100% adoption. That itself has taken us beyond 1 MB, or can... if people use it.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:34:20

Nobody has convincingly solved the scaling issue yet, which is the issue that seems to have caused most of the divisiveness. People claim they have solved it, but the only way to know is to actually gain worldwide mass adoption or conduct some very sophisticated and expensive stress-tests.
That said, you know even if Bitcoin was considerably more perfect it would still get forked. Purely because people want to profit off of being able to make their own coin and mine a bunch of them before daytraders find it and drive the price up to $1/coin.

I'm surprised your first attempt at promoting this didn't get you slapped around a bit by reddit admins (or did it?). You spammed it to every crypto sub in rapid fire. Very blatant advertising.

Windows 10 absolutely does force updates, at least in the home edition where you can't use the group policy editor to turn them off. You can *defer* upgrades, but that's it, and you can't defer critical updates. You also are unable to disable the automatic restarts, instead they are scheduled for times when you aren't "using" your computer, which so happens to be in the middle of batch scripts in my case. Registry edits are required to tame this mess of an OS. Or you know, unplug the ethernet cable and turn off wifi.
This sub asking for big blocks is not as new as you'd think. We have some militant folks against them, but most of us have been reasonably open minded when it comes to a *small* block size increase. This doesn't mean supporting 2x, BU, Cash, etc, however. Those projects simply used the scaling debate as leverage for a political power grab. I'm not saying it has to be core that does the work, but if it's a different dev team they will be held to the same standards of planning and testing - or higher.

Don't get me wrong, Lightning is extremely promising. Certainly moreso than just raising the block limit. My point is only that it hasn't been pushed to its limits yet. Because of that, we can't be sure it'll work as well under full load or what the limits are in practice.
The scaling issue is not solved until those limits exceed the world's maximum needs.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:46:58
Perhaps this technology is not of use to people who transact once every 100 days or even twice every 100 days. But if they transact say, 10 times every 100 days, it looks a lot better.
This is not about making occasional, one-off use of bitcoin cheap and fast. This is about making repeated, high frequency use of bitcoin cheap and fast. You may not find much use for it, but imagine this: all exchanges, miners, and payment processors having channels. That means a lot of traffic that doesn't have to get routed through and stored forever on the blockchain. I mean, speculation is kind of much of what bitcoin is right now. It's already mostly off-chain, but a lot of the more security-conscious folks store their coins on-chain and swing trade instead of day trading. This technology will satisfy their needs as well. In fact, daytraders who use lightning-enabled exchanges would be able to keep their coins in their own wallets and only transfer back and forth the amounts they are directly trading. Yeah, shapeshift is going to have a lot of fun with that one, I'm sure. They'd be crazy not to.
So for those of us who aren't just speculators, all this traffic moving "off chain" should give us some much needed relief until other scaling technologies are implemented. It's not like LN is the only thing being actively worked on. You have to see it as part of a suite of solutions.

Keep in mind, that's the versioning for the *protocol*, not the client software. When it hits 1.0, what that really means is that developers can now start building clients without fear of the protocol being changed on them.
Client software was bitcoin's weak point for a long time, but then wallets like Electrum and hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger figured things out. It may take a while before third parties integrate lightning into their wallets in user friendly ways.

The *channel* starts and ends with the same amount, but the two parties do not. Their balances simply have to sum to the original amount.
Eg, if I open a joint chequing account with you, and put $100 dollars it, then later agree to sign a statement allowing you to withdrawl all of that money and keep it - that's pretty much how LN channels work. The maximum amount in the account is agreed on in advance, but after that it can move between the two parties however they wish.
Not sure why you bring up saving/lending/borrowing? LN is about paying...

Centralization of side chains will not bleed over onto bitcoin's main chain. You're making a fuss over nothing. This cannot possibly threaten bitcoin.
Also, if you read the details provided in other comments, this centralization caused by the use of federations in rootstock is temporary. It's easier to use federations for now, get things working, then use drivechains later.

For many first adopters, the main motivation is "because we can".
Ethereum is a solution looking for a problem, but many tech innovations started life that way. Absolutely nothing wrong with the "unleash it and see how people use it" approach.
I mean, bitcoin's creator *intended* it to be a currency but at the moment it's mostly digital gold and speculation. So even when your product has identified the problem it intends to solve, there's no guarantee that's even how it'll be used in the end.

It's going to be very hard to get said consensus, because everyone has different ideas over how much is too much, how little is too little. Then since you're doing a hard fork, you'll have a whole other debate over the opportunity to make a few other changes while you're at it.

Huh, they basically say you can buy stuff with bitcoin, and while the seller must declare that as income and charge GST/PST/HST, there's no mention of the buyer having to track capital gains/losses. That's... not how I thought that worked. Canada tax law did something right for a change.
Reading more, they consider bitcoin a barter good for the purposes of purchasing goods and services. Only the seller is on the hook for using the fair market value to report as income and charge GST/PST/HST. It's a very sensible policy. I only wish there were more things I could buy with bitcoin in Canada.

For anyone who knows about Ethereum: Drivechains are basically equivalent to Plasma.
The more you learn about both Bitcoin and Ethereum, the more you see that the scaling solutions are virtually identical. The main difference is that I haven't seen Bitcoin core devs support anything like sharding, and probably for good reason as it comes with centralization concerns.

No. Ethereum doesn't have their version of lightning (Raiden) yet either. Ethereum's current scale comes from having very short block times and effectively much higher tps.

Yeah, I had to look at the source code for the btc-recovery tool to figure out what it was doing.
After converting to hex, shave off the first 3 bytes (6 hex characters) and the last several bytes (the CRC) and you're left with 64 hex digits (32 bytes), part of which is the hash and the other part is the IV. If you look at the actual binary/ASCII value you can see the 3-byte string at the beginning that you need to cut off. That part specifies the wallet type, it's not part of the hash.
I was skeptical this would work so I actually tried the same technique against an Electrum 2.7 wallet I set up with the password "test", and JtR cracked it basically instantly.
However, 4 hours into running against a combinatorial phrase list and, well... we'll see what happens but I'm not particular hopeful, haha.

I can believe it. The going rate for a web dev post-2000 and up to about 2008 in Canada was about $50k-$100k/year depending on your experience and whether you did front-end or back-end. I imagine people involved in financial back-end stuff were paid even more - you don't want to underpay the guy who's in charge of your online banking security...
I just built e-learning websites. Not quite as much money in that. Salary was $52k/year, but when I did contracting it was at times as high as $60/hr. Started off at $25/hr, though, as a fresh inexperienced intern.
Thing is, I lived alone - no dependents - in the suburbs where rent was cheaper and still just slide by most of the time. It was still expensive to live in that city, and hourly rates and salaries reflected that. Before it died, the company I worked for ended up outsourcing a lot to make up for that.
I also heard stories about companies hiring under-the-table contractors, nothing recorded, no taxes... shady as shit.

Then there's the whole futures thing. I know it's anecdotal, but it feels like a sea change. It's just too bad that all this happened now instead of say in 2 years when the LN and sidechains had been perfected to a point where the network ran like... well... lightning.

To add what you've already been told, blocks will still be just as full as ever, so miners will continue to make just as much money as they do now. What lighting brings to the table is a way of amortizing the high transaction fees across very large numbers of transactions.
This buys bitcoin *real* scalability. However, it still relies on the base layer capacity. At some point in the future, bitcoin will still likely need a base capacity upgrade. That *may* be a hard fork on the main chain, but it may *also* be the creation of a side chain with either larger blocks or lower block time intervals or both. The latter wouldn't require a hard fork so it might be the better choice *if* trustless 2-way-pegs becomes a solved problem.

The underlying layer would be more useless if its security were compromised in the name of reducing fees.
There is another solution that might give you the best of all worlds, but it's going to be almost certain several more years before it's perfected, and that's side chains.
In the meantime, it's not just bitcoin devs who are working on side chains. Ethereum devs are as well. The worlds really do seem to collide more often than you'd think. And a side chain technology would not require the approval of the bitcoin core team - so whether you love them or hate them doesn't matter anymore.
People seemed to love to hate SegWit over in the other sub, but I wonder if they realize that it has given a plethora of non-core developers all the tools they need for rapid innovation not just on 2nd layers, but on parallel chains as well. If bitcoin core wanted to wash their hands of having to make scaling decisions on behalf of the whole community, that was a hell of a good approach.

Also might be worth pointing out - blurring them in the way you've done still gives away information that will help with brute forcing the QR code.  For example, the shade of grey in each "pixel" can be used to estimate how many smaller QR black pixels have been blurred underneath. So there are at least some bits of entropy lost by doing that.
Got sensitive information? Don't blur it. Put a solid color box over it.

As the other guy said, you have to "buy" RSK tokens to use rootstock. Additionally, there is no particular reason why dApps require third party tokens. They run natively on Ethereum and are paid for using Ether (technically gas, but the exchange between Ether and gas is internal and automatic). Setting up a token, however, allows greater flexibility in who pays for the transactions and also the tracking of virtual assets separately from Ether. If rootstock becomes popular the *exact thing* will be set up with it.

Keep in mind that the centralization only exists in the two-way peg. The side chain itself is still decentralized. The risk is about the same as using shapeshift or changelly to covert between cryptos. And once you've made the conversion, you're decentralized again.

That's a distinct possibility, yes. And I do believe that if core proposed a 2 MB block size increase, a huge majority of the market would think "OK, let's do this".
But there are two things worth thinking about.
1. Would 2 MB even help?
2. How badly would this screw over small node operators?
So... is the tradeoff worth it?
I think we're well past the point where even 2 MB blocks would help. I mean, we already have effective 2 MB blocks with SegWit but the big exchanges don't give a shit. So what would we need? 4 MB? 8 MB?
You've got a lot of technical opposition to larger blocks on the basis of preventing the loss of full nodes. You've got at least one core dev who wants to *shrink* blocks. I hard a hard time imagining core getting the *internal consensus* they need in this case.
I don't see a clear path forward except through side chains and 2nd layers, but that will take a while to implement (on mainnet and among the big services), and in the meantime things are probably going to get pretty depressing around here.

[The rest was transferred out of Mt Gox's hot wallet over a lengthy period of time - slowly but surely]( Deliberate theft by an unknown party/parties.
Mark did some very shady things with manipulating account balances behind the scenes (which he did time in prison for), but has never been formally accused of stealing the coins. To date, nobody knows who is responsible.
Mark claims that some sort of malleability bug allowed the attacker to steal the coins. We will probably never know the truth - such claims require actual evidence of how the attack occurred, and none is forthcoming. Bitcoin legacy transactions *can* be malleated in some ways, but AFAIK this would not allow theft except in combination with poorly secured third party implementations. So Mark can't blame bitcoin here.
Edit: I've apparently been living under a rock. It's believed that the coins were [stolen by Alexander Vinnik]( who has been arrested on money laundering charges.

The concept of 7 degrees of separation is being applied here.
Do a traceroute to a random website, even one in a different country. See how many hops you have. In principle the LN would work similarly.
In the LN demonstration video I believe they had 3 hops, and it was *FAST*.
You're right, it's *less* decentralized that bitcoin's regular node system. However, LN nodes are incentivized to run - unlike full nodes. They make profits. We can expect a reasonable number of them to appear in time.

I'd be up for some reduced volatility. IMO the volatility is a mental barrier towards using bitcoin as a currency. On the other hand you can't get to $1 million/coin by 2020 without volatility... so what you're saying is that the CME futures will be directly responsible for John McAfee having to eat his own dick.

Segwit was created as it is specifically to avoid a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:53:15
It should work just fine, because miners will confirm the transaction and put it in the blockchain even though the non-SegWit service is unable to personally verify the transaction.
If the coins are transferred to a non-SegWit address, they will no longer be "SegWit coins".
Bech32 might be a different story given how little support there is for it right now, but P2SH-type SegWit addresses have the necessary support to ensure smooth sailing.
There is one possible caveat: if some exchange ignores even *confirmed* transactions based on their own node's inability to verify them, then there could be problems. I would have thought we'd see people freaking out on the front page by now if that was happening, though.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:36:28
2 MB won't accomplish anything. I used to think that mass SegWit adoption would be temporary relief, but I no longer believe so. It's taken too long to activate and get to this point that the period of time in which 2 MB blocks would have helped is now in the past. With bitcoin being all over the media these days, potential demand is so high that it will immediately eat up any reasonable block size you throw at it. Fees are set by people bidding on them, so if bigger blocks just get eaten up by a huge backlog of demand, fees aren't going to get any better.
Something *else* needs to be done. It is being done. Just not quickly enough for the impatient hordes. Sidechains/drivechains and the lightning network.
Ethereum has even started having their own network congestion, and they even have a flexible block size that miners can increase. And yet they too are forced to implement side chains (plasma) and lightning networks (Raiden) and even more aggressive techniques (sharding). It now seems obvious that having a flexible block cap just buys you a bit of time. And it does come with a cost for node operators.
Things are going to get far worse before they get better, because there are no good solutions that you can just rush out the door.

I was under the impression that the prevailing belief was that futures would *decrease* volatility.

The LD50 of table salt is supposedly around 3300 mg/kg. That's the amount of sodium that kills 50% of people. So multiply 3300 by your weight in kgs then divide by 1000 to get how many grams of salt would be reasonably likely to kill you. For me that would be 230g of salt, but I wouldn't dare consume anywhere near that much at once. The worst I probably get on any semi-regular basis is 2g in highly salted fast food meals.

I'd like to think that miners have brains and realize that spamming the very network which pays their bills is a bad move. I am not convinced that this whole miner-spam conspiracy theory is true. Of course I will change my mind the moment a compelling blockchain analysis shows otherwise.
Anyway, LN still uses the blockchain to create temporary payment channels, so if *someone* spams the shit out of the blockchain, it will have an effect on LN as well. Less of one than for on-chain transactions, but it won't go unnoticed.

It's like a chequing account. Want to buy a coffee a day? Put a few months worth of bitcoin into your channel so that you don't have to be constantly closing it and opening new ones. I don't see what's so hard about that.


You seem to keep ignoring that it's a network. There are many hundreds of nodes just on testnet, and there will be many more than that on mainnet. Networks have an interesting property - unless every single path between you and a destination is blocked, you'll still reach the destination. Big hubs will simply be a matter of convenience for people, and they might save you money in fees by allowing you to open and close fewer channels over time. But they aren't going to stand in the way of the network's ability to route payments.
You also seem to forget the purpose of LN is mostly to facilitate rather small transactions. At least for now. For large, one-off transactions you still will be using the base blockchain. Fortunately, a large number of bitcoin transactions are quite small, so to the extent that these move "off chain", your high value one-off transactions will be competing to a lesser extent for space on the blockchain.
A true scaling solution will not end with LN. We're also going to need side chains with properly trustless 2-way pegs.
Bitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency facing these problems - it is simply the first to run into this issue due to its popularity, and so is the one feeling the pain the most. Ethereum is getting to the same point, and the devs are thinking of exactly the same solutions. Nobody currently has any more promising answers for scaling than LN/Raiden and side chains/Plasma for traditional blockchain-based cryptos.
If this takes too long, and bitcoin continues to have scaling problems for a long time, people could end up moving to Ethereum - only to find that their arrival causes much the same problems there.
Adoption and speculation has arrived more quickly than innovation. But you know what they say about necessity...
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:30:06
Once again, you're entirely mistaken.
Letting it "settle" means confirms on the blockchain. Don't pay an adequate fee? Then your transaction to open a channel is stuck, and the channel is simply never opened (until you fix the situation using RBF/wait for the transaction to get dropped from the mempool). **Channels are only opened once they get confirms on the blockchain. Channels are only closed once they get confirms on the blockchain.**
Settlement = confirms. They are synonyms. The only transactions which are off-chain are the ones that occur *between* the opening and closing of a channel.
Another point you don't seem to get is that all channels are multisig. There are two owners of the transaction. You aren't allowed to do jack shit unless the other party agrees with you. 
But hey, go ahead. Try it. It's not like testnet coins cost anything.

New coins aren't mined.
Blocks are mined. New coins are just a reward for doing so. The act of mining is the ordering of transactions into blocks and the discovery of a nonce that satisfies difficulty requirements. Nothing about "mining" requires the creation of new coins - that is an entirely optional outcome.
You are right, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. But you seem extremely confused about the fine details beyond that.

You don't understand.
The way bitcoin works, miners and nodes are largely redundant and only serve to make the system more secure and antifragile.
Transaction throughput is NOT determined by nodes and miners. It is determined by the block size limit and type of transactions that are occurring on the network. Adding more nodes and miners will not help in the slightest.
Supply = 1 MB every 10 minutes
Demand = total size of all transactions in the mempool (exclude SegWit witness data)
If you add a lot of miners *suddenly*, throughput temporarily increases until difficulty adjusts. The difficulty system is what ensures that "supply" is unaffected by the number of nodes.

He's quite possibly deceased. There are at least two good candidates that are currently deceased: Hal Finney and Dave Kleiman. I am not particularly convinced in either theory. However, both make some logical sense.
Hal had the skills and even some interesting coincidentally-named neighbors (Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto). But to be Satoshi he would have had to plan and perfectly execute a rather elaborate ruse, including having conversations with himself over the internet.
Dave Kleiman was Craig Wright's friend and business partner. Craig may have even been tangentially involved with Bitcoin's creation, and is now trying to take too much credit for it.
There's also the theory (somewhat popular here) that Satoshi literally can't speak up at this point without causing panic. Don't ask me to explain - I don't quite get it either.

The price of bitcoin fluctuates +/-10% entirely unexpectedly and often daily for no underlying reason at all. Quite often on the back of sheer rumor or even a tweet or two or maybe just because a whale woke up on the wrong side of the bed. That's volatility.

Edit: Ugh, it's terminology all the way down. The best I can come up with is that there are two 'prices' for futures: the delivery price (what it costs to buy a futures contract), and the spot price (what you expect it to actually be worth when it matures). Once you buy a contract, your delivery price is locked in. If the spot price ends up going down relative to what you paid for the contract, this is "contango". If it goes up, this is "backwardation". If you're just planning to resell the contract or settle it, I expect you'd want it to be in backwardation so that you can get more than you paid for it. However, I assume you can also short and long contracts as well, so if most of the contracts on the market are in contago, you can short them and make a profit that way.

Yes, you're correct. Although how much is a "significant amount" of bitcoin depends on a lot of things.
If they network is large enough, they will be many possible routes between you and a destination, so if one becomes unbalanced, others can take over until the previous is rebalanced/closed and re-opened.
If payments are overwhelming unidirectional (unbalanced), eg customers buying "Starblocks" coffee, then the sender's side of the channel can become depleted, and they will need to open a new channel, yes.
But this needn't be hard to understand for end users. Wallets just need to use clever UIs or automate part of the process. The lightning network will need probably as much genius in front-end development as it needs in back-end development, because it's quite a departure from how people are used to using money (even moreso than the blockchain).

Nothing will be gained from bringing up the same tired talking points that has been beating dead horses with for three years.
Don't like it? Fork it. That's what people in agreement with you have already done, but their products failed to convince the majority. Bitcoin core has a different vision for scaling than you do, that's all.
If you care so much, you should learn the math and programming and contribute. Of course you will probably find your fork going nowhere, because although there are a lot of people who agree with you, it seems that they can't accomplish much of anything without infighting and outright incompetence. Honestly I think the anti-core movement is summed up mostly as "internet drama", driven further by strong anti-Western influences coming from corporations based in China.
The actually productive projects that disagreed with bitcoin didn't try to con people with similarly named forks. If you want a drastically different vision for scaling, you have tons of options, so go find them and stop bitching.

You were good right up until your last sentence. The current high fees are not caused by a shortage of miners or nodes, but a glut of demand. To get into the next block you need to compete with all the transactions in the mempool over fees. Right now you need to pay around 300 Sat/B. That's quite a lot, but if you use a SegWit transaction you might be able to keep the transaction fee semi-reasonable depending on your point of view.
The way bitcoin has been engineered is that adding new miners or nodes does not increase supply for transaction throughput. Adding miners/nodes increases redundant verifications and security.

The rate of adoption will depend on the perceived value of the innovation.
To most people, SegWit is just a behind-the-scenes optimization - if they even understand that much. The benefits, if you read bitcoin core's FAQ, are really only understandable to people who know how bitcoin works. "Linear scaling of sighash operations", "script versioning", "malleability fixes"... SegWit is being marketed to developers, not end users. Such as the devs who are building lightning networks and sidechains.

How is that relevant? Maybe you're a shit coder. Maybe you're a good coder, but not in a way that's relevant here. Maybe you haven't read a lick of LN source code or even bothered to watch a youtube video (which, I'll admit, is how I got my info), and are using your "expertise" to make people think you know how it is.
I'm a coder too. Doesn't mean I can grasp WTF is going on with LN behind the scenes, so I have to get my info from people who know how to explain these sorts of issues in ways that are easy for my front-end-dev brain to understand.
But if you want to prove me wrong, wait until LN is on mainnet and double spend on the LN. See if you can get away with it. You seem to be sure you can do this, sounds like a cakewalk according to you, one which nobody in the three separate LN dev teams has thought of! I dare you to try.
Want to know how LN prevents foul play? [Read this]( The mechanism preventing double spending is just the blockchain itself. The mechanism preventing "double spending" (not really a proper term) on LN itself, before channels are closed, is that doing so requires lying about the current state of your channel, which is noticed by the other party, and through a clever multisig trick allows them to exact vigilante justice on your ass by saying "actually, no, I'M robbing YOU" (and getting away with it).
So, the LN deliberately allows one person to steal channel funds if the other party lies about the channel's state.  So now you see the basis of my dare. Give it a go! See what happens!
Much of your misunderstanding may be caused by you thinking that channels are one-to-many. They are not. They are between *two* parties. One-to-many is acchieved by opening multiple channels, which are not open until transactions are confirmed on the blockchain, entirely preventing doublespends. As with normal transactions, it will be a good idea not to trust channels until several confirms - it is possible for history to be (rarely) rewritten over a small number of blocks.

I suspect most of them did not commit any resources to preparing for SegWit integration until after it activated.

I think it's a chicken and egg problem, though. Speculation and a store of value are the "killer apps" right now mostly because we've put the dream of small, fast, cheap transactions on hold until new innovations are made.
We'd probably be seeing an increase in everyday usage if it were economical to do so. And an increase in bitcoin's use as a bona fide internet currency would make it insanely liquid, which would benefit speculators as well.
Okay, we don't need "perfected" sidechains to get most of the way there. Doesn't mean we shouldn't aim for that goal - but IMO something less perfect is likely to catch on before then, and once implemented across the ecosystem it might be difficult to get everyone to switch to a new system, no matter how better it may be.

FYI I've reasonably exhausted any combination of "electrumpassword" (and many other similar phrases) followed by 1-2 digits or special characters. I've been regularly running combinatorial dictionaries of millions of phrases, plus additional variations with digits and special characters and all the other strange suffixes you've suggested might be involved.
Anyway, I'm gone for 2 weeks starting Monday, and when I come back I will be needing to use my computer for normal things once more. I'm afraid I won't be helping out with this much longer. Tonight and part of tomorrow, and that's that.
Best of luck... I still think it's time to hire the pros. It seems more and more likely that a decent amount of brute force is needed to break this, and my 8-core processor simply isn't up to the task. If it were as simple as a few words with a symbol at the end, we'd have it by now.

P2SH addresses will never be phased out. It's not a transient address format. Yes, Bech32 will eventually be available, but it will be a *choice*, not a requirement, and P2SH-based SegWit will continue to function as before.
So you're waiting an unknowable amount of time for "best" when you could have "better" right now. There's no telling when core will put Bech32 support into the client, and they do not release new bitcoin core clients particularly rapidly.

I've made a python script to make wordlists by combining words (something John the ripper can't do, and btc-recover crashes with long word lists when you try to do this). Been running these composite lists through John the ripper, no success yet.
I'm marking assignments over the next few days and can dedicate some CPU cycles to this task in the meantime. Let me know if someone else gets the password in the next few days? I'd rather stop if you've already solved it :)

Your first sentence is correct.
The main chain only gets a record of the sum total of many transactions, so while you'll be able to see that sums add up correctly, you won't be able to see that a person spent $3 on a coffee. This has rubbed some folks the wrong way, as it's a drastic departure from the "everything on the chain" mentality that bitcoin started with. But it has benefits. Aside from the speed and efficiency, it also gives you a great deal more privacy. For example, only you and the coffee shop will know the fine details of your transaction - whether one or both of you tell anyone else is up to you.

I gotta say, this is all smelling very weird to me.
You *still* haven't provided a list of likely words. You do know that a full brute force attack is fairly unlikely, right? 16 characters? Forget about it - not even with a high performance computing system. I am using hybrid dictionary/brute force attacks and at best can pull 6 characters out of my ass to wedge in between dictionary words. Sounds like my competitors can just about manage 8.
How did you determine that it starts with an e?
So you do use special characters fairly frequently in passwords, then?
I have several instances of JtR and btc-recover running simultaneously using different rule sets, they've been running for 2 days now. All been going on the "letters only, maybe a 15" rule so far. If you think there's a special character, that changes the game.

I know the arbitrage is all done by bots, at least when possible.
Years ago I wrote a bot that I ran using fake balances against bitcoin's market and it made a consistent "profit" (increased the fake BTC balance), but only on zero-fee exchanges. It didn't make enough of a profit per trade to make up for the fees on most other exchanges. This bot was based on calculation a confidence interval for the price, fit using a robust linear regression for the last n candles. It bought when the price was below a 95% confidence interval, and sold when the price was above it. More sophisticated bots could no doubt work far better, but you'd be highly incentivized to keep the algorithm secret.

Yes, there will be centralized services. Just like the ones that have existed since the very early days of bitcoin. And just like them, if you don't want to use them, you don't have to. The lightning network is a *network* that route your payments from point A to point B without requiring "permission" to do so.
You'll just have to run our own node in the network if you want to avoid having to use third party services. Exactly the same requirement that existed in bitcoin itself since the very beginning.

I've only got a 8-core machine, but letter-by-letter brute force may be hopeless in any case. I remember being able to brute force 6 letters in minutes back in the 90s, so I figured it would be super easy these days! What I didn't count on was the encryption algorithms being so much more computationally expensive, I guess. Back in the day it was just md5.
I'm sticking with the dictionary attacks, but with that it's about keeping the lists of reasonable length and trying to use words the target is likely to use. On that note, OP hasn't given us much to work with except that the password is probably "stupid".
This just goes to show, the strategy of "correcthorsebatterystaple" actually works well enough. I would have cracked "correcthorsebattery" by now, but going from three word combos to four word combos is out of my league.
I am using wordlists that I've downloaded, added some likely words to, and then removed duplicates and sorted in excel. Then run a python script to make "digram" (combos of two words) and "trigram" (combos of three words) lists. The trigram list required me to uninstall a bunch of steam games to fit it on my SSD.
The rules I'm using in JtR are:
    [List.Rules:Bitcoin]
    :
    A0"myelectrum"
    A0"testelectrum"
    A0"electrumtest"
    A0"electrum"
    A0"acerelectrum"
    Az"15"
    Az"1515"
    Az"pw"
    Az"pwd"
    Az"pass"
    Az"passwd"
    Az"password"
    A0"15"
    A0"1515"
    A0"pw"
    A0"pwd"
    A0"pass"
    A0"passwd"
    A0"password"
    Az"myelectrum"
    Az"testelectrum"
    Az"electrumtest"
    Az"electrum"
    A0"electrum" Az"15"
    A0"electrum" Az"1515"
    A0"electrum" Az"pw"
    A0"electrum" Az"pwd"
    A0"electrum" Az"pass"
    A0"electrum" Az"passwd"
    A0"electrum" Az"password"
    A0"myelectrum" Az"15"
    A0"myelectrum" Az"1515"
    A0"myelectrum" Az"pw"
    A0"myelectrum" Az"pwd"
    A0"myelectrum" Az"pass"
    A0"myelectrum" Az"passwd"
    A0"myelectrum" Az"password"
    A0"electrumtest" Az"15"
    A0"electrumtest" Az"1515"
    A0"electrumtest" Az"pw"
    A0"electrumtest" Az"pwd"
    A0"electrumtest" Az"pass"
    A0"electrumtest" Az"passwd"
    A0"electrumtest" Az"password"
That appends a number of prefixes and suffixes to single words/digrams/trigrams. Hasn't worked for me so far.
I'm also running btc-recover at times, as its token system is a bit easier to use, I'm keeping a short list of "likely" words in that but it's been just as unsuccessful as JtR.

He would pay capital gains tax when he sells it. Or uses it to buy stuff. Since he mined it, the cost basis is 0. Thus he reports an earnings equal to the sale price or fair market value of whatever he buys. If he sells at all once, he reports $1,000,000 income (or whatever it is) for sale of assets.
Since he's had it for long enough, it will be long-term capital gains, which has a lower fee.

Nicehash isn't bitcoin mining - it's altcoin mining. Why would the downfall of an altcoin mining company matter much to bitcoin in the long run? The reason this affects the bitcoin community is that Nicehash paid people in bitcoin. All things considered, however, they were small fish. Exchanges have been constantly hacked throughout bitcoin's history, and many of those incidents are barely remembered. So why would nicehash deserve our undue attention, when it's barely even related to bitcoin at all?
I agree with your sentiment that this sub has taken a plunge. But there's little we can do about it. This is a symptom of what I have seen occur IRL over the last few weeks. The average joe speculators are now in on bitcoin, and they are buying with the intent of selling at a higher price never having learned how bitcoin works or what it can do beyond serving as a speculative investment.
Altcoins shills are taking advantage of the situation, as well, calling this the downfall of bitcoin as a currency.
It's a bit of a mess, no doubt.

Bitcoin has seen this kind of growth before, it's nothing unprecedented. Don't think in terms of dollars, but in percent.
And yeah, it's also crashed 90% before as well, and could very well do so again.

I was studying to get into web development when the bubble burst. It reduced my future job prospects as the number of students graduating did not decrease, but the number of companies to work for did. When I got employment, it was for a privately owned web design company, which helped shelter us from the pessimism in the stock market. But that company still struggled to make ends meet for like 6 years and was eventually purchased (and shut down) by another corporation. Many of the web companies that initially survived the bubble bursting still eventually ran out of money.
What a similar event would look like for this market: 75%+ drop in the price of all cryptocurrencies sustained for at least a few years. Bankruptcy or amalgamation of a large proportion of blockchain start-ups and even those previously considered mature. A long period of far less VC money and new start-ups entering the scene. Some alts would become zombie coins, having lost most of their community and 2nd layer innovators. 
So imagine the eruption of Mt. Gox, except worse. A bubble bursting isn't just about the price going down, it's about a strong change in market sentiment from optimism to pessimism. And it will take the market a long time to be optimistic again.

Hi everyone,
Assuming my efforts fail, here is the input format needed to get John the Ripper working on this:
    userID:$electrum$2*8285fce2ea64c60e8318f58da0b84cf6*7314cf8b1c22077c786004f32a801ab2
Shove that in a text file and feed it into JtR.
The command line option is then:
    john --format=electrum hash.txt
Plus whatever options you wish to use.
You must also use the "bleeding" version of JtR [available here]( and install a number of dependencies.
Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:51:09
I've got something running over here but I've already eliminated a lot of options.
Just out of curiosity, have you verified that the script you used to extract that hash can be used to generate a crackable hash from a wallet with a *known* password? Create a new wallet with a password you know, use the same script to produce the hash, and see if the btc-recover tool will crack it if you include the actual password in a short words list.
Always worth ruling out software that's not working right.

The miners will continue mining for the fees, which are already worth a large chunk of the block reward.
Fees in 100+ years, assuming bitcoin still exists, are likely to add up to a lot of money. Keep in mind that miners can make *even more* on fees if block size is increased, and I consider it quite likely that this will be done eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:37:56

Because even though centralized, it does not affect the main chain, and unlike fork attempts, it also does not risk disrupting the main chain during the fork event. Side chains in general are genius and will let people innovate freely and rapidly on top of bitcoin while still rooting their innovations to the main chain.
IMO this is the innovation that Roger and Gavin and Jeff Garzik and all the other forkers should be drooling over. This lets them all realize their own personal dreams of bitcoin *while leveraging the bitcoin network in a non-confrontational way*. I'd take a 8 MB per block side chain a HELL of a lot more seriously than an 8 MB per block contentious fork.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:06:08
Remembering that it could take years to achieve mass adoption of rootstock in the first place, they have plenty of time to address the centralization issue. Alternatively, they may be just another proof of concept in a long line of them working towards a more ideal side chain.
I don't want to hate on something just because Jihan is involved. Not everything he does necessarily turns to shit. After all, he's involved in bitcoin proper as well and did a lot to secure the network by producing mining hardware that's a heck of a lot more energy efficient than GPU or CPU mining.

Not at all. Anyone who owned their private key was not affected, regardless of the wallet they used.
The hack was of an altcoin mining service that pays its miners in bitcoins but retains them until a minimum balance builds up. It was these below minimum balances that were stolen, plus any not yet withdrawn by users, plus any that accumulated while the website was under maintenance. All things considered it certainly seems like it could have been an inside job.

If you read *why* the lack of stability was a problem for Steam, it had to do with how long it took transactions to go through - the value could change a lot in the meantime and cause the transaction to be cancelled.

That's what you'd think if you see bitcoin purely as a speculative investment.
But that's not why it exists. We can't stop the armies of speculators piling on, and why should we? Bitcoin is partly the freedom to do what you want with it, and if you want to daytrade or speculate, go for it. But buying and selling on some exchange doesn't make you any wiser to what bitcoin is actually *for*.


The only people who would say this with a straight face have either not been paying attention to recent developments, or have a horse in someone else's game.
[One of Rusty Russel's recent blog posts]( is going to end up being extremely prophetic, I am sure. The growing pains will be severe, but there's an end in sight. Steam won't be the last to pull out, and they weren't the first. Securing the network after block reward subsidies are essentially gone will cost a fuckton. Fees will be astronomical.
That's why sidechains and LN are being so avidly worked on - they are ways around this little problem. LN is cool, but I think sidechains hold more promise, IMO.

What bitcoin is about is best summed up by the title of the white paper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System".
If developers can deliver on that promise while retaining security and decentralization, I frankly don't care how they do it.
The blockchain concept is a means to an end, that's all. If it ends up being used merely as a settlement layer to extend its security and decentralization to a larger system, so be it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:26:52
Because for 1000 transactions, you still only have to make two.
And once you set up a channel, you can use it to send bitcoins to *anybody* who also has a channel open. You don't have to open channels with specific peers.
And all of this is going to get abstracted away by wallet software. Personally I'd do it by calling the lightning channel a "chequing account" and the rest of the user's bitcoins a "savings account". Immediate understanding by the user that they should transfer from savings to chequing (which the wallet will do by opening a channel) before spending.

You don't need to understand it to use it. Think of all the things you use that you don't understand - if you can't think of some, you aren't trying hard enough.
All that matters is if they deliver on the promise - cheap, fast transactions. Everything else is secondary. Usability of wallets may be a bit poor at first, but if there is a need for something better, it'll get built in time.
You can see videos of LN in action. [It looks easy enough]( very much the same process as with Bitcoin itself (keep in mind that most of the video is him explaining what is going on behind the scenes - everyday users won't be mucking around with the console).

If people stop mining bitcoin, difficulty drops, making it favorable again. The current difficulty represents an unstable equilibrium in which the existing group of miners are just barely content. This is how it has been intentionally engineered to work.

Yeah, you're right about that, but reliability of bitcoin deposits and withdrawals should be improved (somewhat) by SegWit. More important, though, it enables them to eventually use LN channels. Exchanges are likely to become major LN hubs, in fact, and since a decent chunk of deposit/withdrawl of bitcoins will be between exchanges, miners, and payment processors that is a case where payment channels can really shine. Maybe not at first, when the amount of coins in a channel is strongly capped, but once the system is more time-tested and those caps are relaxed... hell yes.

The 2.4.1 release still appears to have its original datestamps:

Very few that come to mind. Ethereum is, IMO, the only possible contender. Most everything else is too derivative of bitcoin (not different enough to succeed if bitcoin fails), or too niche.
And just recently Ethereum started having scaling issues due to CryptoKitties, haha. A recent thread on about trying to get Steam to support it instead of bitcoin had an interesting top-voted objection: the network wouldn't be able to handle the demand.
Seems like we're all in this boat together. Forking a coin and slightly changing it will solve nothing, and the scaling solutions being worked on for both Bitcoin and Ethereum are strangely similar... gee I wonder why? ;)
From an economic point of view, a cryptocurrency might do better if it had a well known *perpetually inflationary* schedule, used a perfected proof of stake mining system, implemented lightning and side chains, and permitted confidential transactions. But this doesn't mean bitcoin won't succeed without all of those things... just that if you want to dethrone bitcoin, you need to do better. Network effects are a bitch.

As others have said, yes. Channels are bidirectional and one-to-one and only track their own states, so it's importance that all channels are funded. A channel starts and ends its life with exactly the same amount of bitcoin, and all that changes is how much is split between the two parties. Channel A can't actually receive funds from channel B.
Let's say we have three people and two channels:
    Person A &lt;-- channel A --&gt; Person B &lt;-- channel B --&gt; Person C
Channels A and B actually look like this:
- Channel A: 1 bitcoin total, 50% to both parties
- Channel B: 1 bitcoin total, 50% to both parties
So initial balances per person are:
- Person A: 0.5 BTC
- Person B: 1 BTC (0.5 from each channel)
- Person C: 0.5 BTC
Now Person A wants to send their 0.5 bitcoins to Person C.
The first thing that happens is that Person A (without knowing this is what they're doing, it's all automatic) actually shifts the balance of bitcoins in channel A to Person B, like this:
- Channel A: 1 bitcoin total, 100% to Person B.
Now the balances per person are:
- Person A: 0 BTC
- Person B: 1.5 BTC (1 from channel A, 0.5 from channel B)
- Person C: 0.5 BTC
The next thing that happens is that Person B shifts the balance of Channel B towards Person C:
- Channel B: 1 bitcoin total, 100% to person C.
At no point did bitcoin *actually move* from Channel A to Channel B.
However, now we see that the individual people's balances have changed:
- Person A: 0 BTC
- Person B: 1 BTC
- Person C: 1 BTC
Your ability to move money through LN will be limited by the poorest channel between you and the target.
If person A wants to send more bitcoins to Person C, they need to close the old channel, and fund a new one. In practice payments would not be this large, allowing multiple payments to occur before individual's balances are depleted.

I agree to some extent, but exchanges are fiat on/offramps that are not going to go away and will never become decentralized due to the whole fiat thing. Only exchanges which deal purely in crypto can become decentralized.
Keep in mind that many of the people using these exchanges en mass aren't so interested in using bitcoin as much as they wish to daytrade/swing trade off of its volatility.
For those of us interested in actually *using* bitcoin, the lightning network will indeed contain big hubs - but also many small nodes that offer numerous routes to peers. And as it's just a layer on top of bitcoin, its existence does not compromise the decentralization of the lower layer. In fact, it helps it by allowing devs to avoid runaway increases in block size that would greatly encourage node centralization.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:40:32
The channel is open until the settlement transaction is confirmed, so there is no "once you close a channel it may be stuck in limbo forever". A channels entire funds are on the line until settled. 
This is a bit like zero conf transactions, yes. Except that the thief either has to keep his funds locked in the channel forever, unable to use them for non-lightning payments, or has to settle at which point they are penalized of their entire channel fund for gaming the system.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:09:58
"Confirmed" has no meaning on the lightning network in the first place. It's temporarily replacing one type of verification and double-spending prevention with a game-theory based approach that reverts to traditional confirmation once settled.
Complaining about some risk that exists for channels that literally never settle is ridiculous. Settle once and a while and you'll be fine. 
Have you even bothered to look into what happens to attackers on LN? It's basically counter-robbery and you'd be an idiot to try to rip people off over the LN.
Maybe instead of parroting back BS you read on do some actual, you know... research?

Cool, now depending on what you mean by vaguest of understandings this might be a good time to watch some Andreas Antonopoulos videos and go from there.

The joke is that what's written on the sign are the reasons that many people DO buy bitcoin. The people who are interested in cryptocurrencies are often skeptical of government, corporations, and banks.

I would imagine it's not really "free", since you still need to validate transactions and create blocks and there's still a cost associated in terms of computing resources. But bitcoin is hard to mine because of artificial difficulty which is automatically scaled to the performance of the network. Without that, you could mine reasonable numbers of bitcoins on a laptop computer. And people used to do just that.
Under PoS, it seems that this artificial difficulty is outright removed. All that's left is the necessary computation, and you get rewards proportion to your stake.
Who knows how it'll work. I sometimes think of shapeshifting some of my BTC into ETH but every time I read about ETH it's like I'm wading into a sea of intentionally opaque jargon.
@_date: 2017-02-12 21:40:19
That's true, but until recently there have been relatively few reasons to think that bitcoin could fail from an actual technological point of view. But now that's changed. It's been more than a year since scaling has been a huge concern, and despite massive effort, there is no consensus on how to address it. Other cryptos which are just getting started today don't have to negotiate consensus because they can build their solutions in before any adoption. Bitcoin could very easily lose this race.

Litecoin may have been subject to massive abuse through pump-n-dumps given that it's volume was always very low, but that's hardly a fault of the idea itself, which was to make a crypto better suited to microtransactions. Just because it failed doesn't mean it was a scam.

This is always the response when I bring up node counts - people point out how uncertain they are or how maybe one side is fudging the numbers.
Realize that both sides can spin up numerous/fake nodes, but also that there is a long history of node counts - it's easy to see when things are changing slowly over time or when they suddenly jump in  response to some sort of questionable activity. Sites like coindance also attempt to correct for duplicates, fakes signatures, etc. Not sure how they do it, but the [historical graph]( shows a fairly slow rate of change that makes a lot of sense - for example, bitcoin XT and classic nodes being switched over to BU nodes, and the total count of nodes changing reasonably "organically".
@_date: 2017-02-12 21:45:19
That's like saying, "look, this guy won the lotto jackpot! That means you will too!"
You can't point to people who made it big due to sheer luck as evidence that luck will continue. Even with index stocks, considered one of the safest investments there is, you're still assuming the overall economy will grow.

That's what the article AND the headline is about. Re-read what I wrote.
Open Bazaar isn't even released yet, and you're already bemoaning that nobody uses it? Jesus. It takes time to build up a user base and plenty of people are willing to be pioneers. Unless OB sucks balls from a technical point of view, it should accumulate a user base over time.

I didn't mean algorithmically growing, I meant algorithmically *determined*. The latter allows block size to increase *or* decrease in response to network metrics. Although Classic was really the former.
An algorithmically determined block size doesn't necessarily have to be as simple as "double every 18 months". Instead it can be more like how difficulty is calculated. Use network metrics to figure out a size - and absolutely allow it to decrease if necessary. Right now the 1 MB block size cap was a gut feeling. Nothing else. An algorithm can make more objective decisions than your gut can.
SegWit would solve a lot of problems but will it ever happen? 95% consensus by miners? Seems hopeless. And a UASF is even more controversial than SegWit itself. Seems we're stuck in a deadlock. I hope it ends soon. Although I'd say I've chosen my side (SegWit) I would honestly have a minor celebration for *ANY* form of movement forwards here. Including BU, if for no other reason than I'm sure it would open Core's eyes and get them to actually tackle block size directly instead of their continual worship of a magic number.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:13:50
I agree with the tweet. But of course it will be used as a weapon by both sides. BU supporters see Core's weakness as being centralization as well.
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:41:10
What you are describing would result in a chain split, as SPV clients just blaze ahead with whatever miners decide while full nodes and the core wallets will reject their blocks and maintain a second chain. 
Hopefully that doesn't happen. Not just because it would tank the value of bitcoin, but also because it would cause even more rifts in the bitcoin community. and sometimes expresses the "good riddance" sentiment but I'm not sure that's healthy.
But if a big block fork gains enough support I'm fairly sure Core will cave in and adopt the change themselves, in order to remain relevant.
The future is uncertain, which makes it a bit scary and exciting at the same time.

Well the article is focusing on how it will fall short of the expectation that Open Bazaar will be the next Silk Road, while simultaneously suggesting it may just be a place to sell drugs anyway.
Problem is, that was never the goal. The devs even chose to prevent people from using TOR to access Open Bazaar, reducing options for anonymous trade. They don't *intend* it to be the next Silk Road, and don't intend it to be anonymous either.
It's supposed to be a place to sell goods without exorbitant paypal and eBay fees. And that's literally it. By focusing on drugs, the article misses the point entirely.

I think the reasoning for why the unlimited coin cap is needed was lost in translation.
It also seems a bit odd, really. There will always be a finite amount of transactions that can be processed per unit of time regardless of block size, and that on its own creates a fee market.
Not that I really intend to defend BU. I'm more making the point that Rizun's tweet makes zero sense to me.
@_date: 2017-03-11 20:43:10
A network effect is only as big as the level of adoption. Bitcoin's future is tenuous at best because adoption is low. Same with all other cryptos. None of them can claim to have any significant network effect. When a tiny proportion of people use something, it is easily usurped by a single upstart that appeals to a larger group.
Bitcoin, and all other cryptos, are competing with the existing financial system. The existing financial system *does* have a network effect, and it's truly massive.
You can start talking about bitcoin having a network effect once the technology is mature and woven its way throughout the world's financial system, or at least the Internet's financial system. We're not there yet.
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:11:15
That's what I want too. SegWit's purpose in my mind is to patch some possible transaction malleability exploits. I consider it a security update, and that was indeed its purpose before it got mixed up in the scaling debate due to the effective block size increase it brings.
Ironically I think that in order to get anything like this, BU must be adopted. In the current climate, core is unlikely to take the first step towards changing the block size. And the BU camp seems unlikely to ever adopt SegWit. *HOWEVER* - core seems exactly the sort of group to adopt ideas from particularity successful forks if they see not doing so as an existential risk. I predict that if mining supporting BU come to dominate, that core will consider implementing the ideas of BU in a more careful and tested manner. Then they'll layer SegWit on top of that. With the block size issue settled by removal of the hard cap, SegWit will encounter much less resistance.

No. The actual process must involve both parties.

@_date: 2017-03-29 17:30:27
What the article is talking about is not a 51% vote.
Ethereum now has two chains existing side by side, ETH (majority) and ETC (minority).
What the article is discussing is the possibility that if a similar thing happens with Bitcoin, that the majority hashpower would actively sabotage the minority after the vote has occurred. This would be akin to ETH spending some of its hashpower to DDOS the ETC chain. Hell, maybe that's happening for all I know. And if it is, I'd say it's a bad thing.
And it goes both ways, if SegWit wins, we should criticise miners who spend some of their hashpower trying to kill a split-off BU chain. We aren't allowed to cherry pick.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:33:31
In practice I agree, but I think you'd have a different idea if you ran an exchange and had to pay for lawyers and call center folks to take care of the shitshow that would result from not only removing a long-held ticker symbol, but replacing it with two very similar new ones. Not everybody is going to bother reading e-mails or c
Keeping BTC/XBT the same and adding a new symbol is more in line with what's happening, too. BU would be the new kid in town, but Core would be unchanged (at least to start with). So why change the ticker symbol for an asset that's staying the same? I mean, aside from giving BU a positive spin, that is. Not that I'm against BU, but I think it needs to earn a positive impression as opposed to just being handed the benefit of the doubt.
@_date: 2017-03-29 19:09:40

"Follow the longest" chain is something you do *after* a fork has occurred. The whole 95% thing is to make sure the fork doesn't occur unless it has widespread support.
But I agree, a 95% mining majority was always a bit ambitious, and now it's downright impossible (without a split) because the debate has become political.
The way this works is kind of wierd, though. The 95% requirement is for miners only, who we've already seen can switch allegiance (and a shit ton of hashing power) almost instantly. But miners do not make up the entire Bitcoin ecosystem, and there could easily be a disconnect between what miners vote for and what everybody else wants.
That's why I keep making sure I look at nodes, and how many nodes are running various forks of bitcoin. If BU activates at 51%+ but the nodes have 51%+ running Core+SegWit, things are going to get weird.
@_date: 2016-03-17 18:17:01
Yeah, you make some good points.

Bitcoin was supposed to be trustless. That includes not having to trust miners. Mining was intended to be highly distributed. Not run by ASICs in giant mining farms, with single individuals having the power to vote on behalf of tens of thousands of people willy nilly.

They really want to be seen as the real bitcoin, including getting a ticker that doesn't make them look obviously different from BTC. There was an exchange that said BTC would stay BTC, but BU would get something like BTU. They were not happy.

That's the problem. Miners are a small subset of users with an unique incentive to maximize their revenue, which is basically transactions/sec multiplied by the fee per transaction plus block rewards. I imagine that most of the rest of us want to maximize transactions/sec as well, but minimize the fee per transaction.
Miners have a different economic incentive than non-miner users, and make up a smaller group, so cannot be trusted to represent the whole.
Miners might have had a larger overlap with the entire userbase had ASICs never arrived on scene. But they did.

The nodes determine which chain is the majority.
That's why we won't have &gt; 1 MB blocks happening yet. 1 MB Core nodes are (probably) the majority. Although the number can be easily manipulated, it's changed fairly smoothly and organically for quite a while, and that link I gave you attempts to remove fake nodes/duplicates/etc.
Wallets don't matter. Full nodes matter. Full nodes and miners are, together, what will determine the future. Nobody else really has a say. So if you have a strong opinion on this matter, spin up a full node. I mean, I guess big exchanges can have their say as well, of course.
Only about 6k full nodes and a handful of mining pools. I'm not very happy that bitcoin's consensus relies on such a small number of people.

I guess if you were posting on a BBS back in the day, you would have said that the Internet would never amount to anything because it was too hard to use? It was basically just geeks using it back then, too. Similar situation to now with crypto. Lots of lofty ideas, but not much user experience. That comes later.
Bitcoin itself has a lot that it can do to improve usability. It needs the equivalent of DNS, for example. That alone would solve SO MANY usability issues with bitcoin. And if bitcoin takes too long to do that... another crypto will take over.

Same supporters doesn't make it the same thing. They were definitely different things.
Although it's probably a fair assessment to say that Classic took over the reins from XT, and now BU has taken the reins from Classic. However, BU has far fewer nodes running it (or at least announcing they are running it) than classic ever did. Which I find... interesting. And they've taken a step backwards. I could have supported XT, because it set block size algorithmically instead of this "emergent consensus" system that gives an oligopoly of mining pools even more power.

It's an attack if they use underhanded tactics to quell opposition. The question is whether the tactics in the article are underhanded, or if it's just "following the longest chain", which is how bitcoin is intended to operate. I am not informed enough to say, so decide for yourself.
Just keep in mind that the disparity between miners (proportion signalling BU is getting very close to 50%...) and nodes (the proportion running BU is tiny) strongly suggests that the miners do not represent the bitcoin ecosystem. In my mind this is the only really dangerous thing about BU. Having bigger blocks or a non-fixed block size isn't something we should fear. But the emergent consensus idea for setting the block size gives even more power to mining pools. They're already able to stuff the ballot boxes with money invested in mining hardware. I'd say that's bad enough.
This puts me in a strange place - at odds with both "sides" of this debate. But having to chose, I go with SegWit. Not that my support matters. Not even if I run a node, it doesn't make an ounce of difference. And that's a problem with letting miners decide everything on our behalf. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:07:40
No. SegWit was proposed for one reason: to patch transaction malleability.
It was swept up into the scaling debate after the fact when people realized that *as a side effect* it would effectively increase capacity.
SegWit's primary purpose is to fix a security vulnerability in bitcoin. It doesn't contribute anything to the block size debate, and it wasn't intended to.
BU doesn't solve the block size debate either; it just divorces the devs from having to make the decisions and puts all the onus for making that decision on the miners.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:20:46
Debate is seldom cancerous, and you don't get compromise without debate. Also, consider that design by committee often produces utter trash. So we may not want "compromise" if that means adopting a solution that will have negative consequences in the long term.
What's cancerous are all the people who think that because they own some bitcoin and bought it way back in 2010 or whatever, that they're as knowledgeable as the core devs. Then there are the people who think they have the answer to the scaling issue and going ape on anyone who disagrees. There are really two debates going on - the purely technical one, which is almost never seen here, and the highly politicized one, which infests both this sub and The dev teams - regardless of whether you're talking about core or BU or whatever - know more about bitcoin than most of the rest of us. But if all you read are the opinions on reddit, where people love to vilify those they disagree with, then it's easy to think that BU or core is conspiring against the other side or even bitcoin itself. Hence and They're both full of conspiracy theories aimed at the other group. These are no longer forums for rational discussion of bitcoin. They belong to the conspiracy theorists now.

Nobody was laughing at bitcoin 10 years ago. Nobody saw it coming. Hard to laugh at something you aren't even aware of. And when Satoshi's white paper dropped, people didn't laugh even then. Because it was not crazy.

I think my perspective on this issue is quite unbiased.  Bitcoin is irrelevant in the world. You surround yourself with people who know it and use it, that's why you think otherwise.
It's the most popular of cryptos, but that means nothing when none of them have broken through to make much of a difference in the world at all. I don't mean to say that they *can't* achieve that goal, just that none of them have pulled it off yet.
At this point it's still anybody's game because even though bitcoin is in the lead, the finish line is still miles away.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:10:34
Do you mean Bitcoin Unlimited? Miners are certainly shooting for it, but [nodes aren't](
Nodes represent typical users plus miners, so you can argue that they are a more complete picture of the market. Unfortunately it's also easy to spin up nodes just to make that graph jump around however you like.
It's hard to tell what the market wants when your two choices of reddit community are both occupied by evangelists. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:35:55
I'm out of the loop here, but if a mining pool or coalition of mining pools with 51%+ of the hashing power get together and decide to use their hashing power to dictate things, that's a 51% attack. Even if it works in your favor at the time, that kind of centralization must be opposed. Algorithmically if possible.
@_date: 2017-03-12 03:11:07
If all kinds of demand are equal to you, then yes. Like I said, trading and speculation... that's what bitcoin is right now. The price is high because lots of people are hoping to get rich.
But that's not healthy, IMO. It means that bitcoin can be discarded and replaced by whatever asset comes up next. There aren't enough truly unique services that it offers (in practice), even though in theory it can change the world.
I'm more interested in bitcoin as a tool to solve real world problems like: cheap international remittance, getting around draconian currency controls, and maybe even a proper competitor to e-commerce services like Paypal.
I mean, I've bought stuff off Newegg using bitcoin, so it's definitely got *some* applications that aren't based around trading and speculation. But they do seem few and far between. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 21:08:16
- Bandwidth and storage are limited.
- It takes non-zero time to process each transaction.
- This requires electricity and hardware, which costs money. Lots of it.
- Miners set minimum fees to at least break even given the costs of maintaining hardware. They've been doing this all along. If a miner doesn't like the fee you sent, they won't process your transaction. Maybe someone else will but it might take a while before that particular miner solves a block. So you pay more to prioritize your transactions - as it has always been.
- Difficulty adjustments ensure that growing computing resources are forever countered. Adding new/better mining hardware doesn't improve the network's throughput, it improves the network's security (as long as the hashing power is properly distributed).
The bitcoin network can not be a free, unlimited resource. The laws of physics prohibit it. But it can certainly be freer and less limited than it currently is. That seems to be the only thing that all sides of this debate can agree on.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:32:54
The network won't accept a &gt; 1MB block until the majority of nodes are not running bitcoin core. Nodes reject blocks that don't play by the rules, and right now the majority rule is that blocks over 1 mb are not allowed.
However, some nodes will accept it, causing two or blockchains to exist simultaneously. "Follow the longest chain" is the way you are supposed to resolve that. Not everybody will...
I see what you mean, though. It's not really necessary for BU or XT or really any single fork to win. What matters is their commonalities, because they all inter-operate to some extent.
@_date: 2016-01-28 06:46:00

Even if exchanges want to be neutral, and I'm not sure they can claim they do, just up and changing the ticker name of the current blockchain is potentially confusing for traders. I expect exchanges will keep BTC as BTC and give a possible BU split chain a different name, at least at first. If the BU chain ends up dominating then they will have to carefully consider how to proceed in the least misleading way possible.
I totally understand the desire for BU to not be seen as an alt-coin, but as a viable fork of bitcoin. But exchanges probably don't want to be drowned in excess support tickets saying "where did my coins go?!" by people who don't understand that they need to pay attention to which of two closely related and very similarly named things they bought/sold. So expect exchanges to not up and change ticker names unless they really have to.
Then again, exchanges don't even agree on whether to call the current chain BTC or XBT so who knows what kinds of crazy things they'll do in the future.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:39:08
That seems like a lot because people like to think in terms of absolute amounts. How many dollars it goes up in a given period of time. But the traders over at pushed log charts very strongly. And probably still do. So thinking in terms of relative amounts or percentages.
At the time leading up to and prior to the downfall of Mt Gox, I was an active member of and all the charting pros were using log charts to show that the move up to $1000+ was just a continuation of a very nicely fitting trend line. 
But in your defense, there was another quite vocal minority who used the idea of bubble cycles with predictable timings to try to guess when the next bubble would happen. They were trying to predict the start, top, and drop of a post-Gox bubble. They did not succeed - after the downfall of Gox the price stayed below the ATH until... well... now. But whether or not they succeeded doesn't really matter. What matters is that they acknowledged that there had been bubbles and will continue to be bubbles - something they're almost certainly still correct about.
Perhaps hope makes us see what we want to see. I'd like to think the current growth is "organic" and "sustainable", just as so many people claimed it was pre-Gox. But yeah, there will be downturns... some people will call them bubbles bursting, others will call them corrections. Depends on what you want to believe.
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:59:37
You can use the same argument against hash power.
Bitcoin was supposed to be highly decentralized, but it didn't turn out that way because of ASICs and mining pools. All I know is that mining pools PLUS nodes is more decentralized than either of them alone. Decisions should be made only after considering what both groups want.
@_date: 2017-03-11 17:32:47
Has the plan changed for how SegWit will be activated? Is it no longer hinging on a super-majority of miners signalling for it? Right now we're sitting at 25% with no significant movement up or down in quite a long time.
The gridlock in adopting needed improvements (SegWit has been ready to go for a *year*) don't make me very optimistic. And over the four years that I've been interested in bitcoin, I've seen a huge decline in the number of start-ups hoping to use the network for anything other than trading and speculating. Microtransactions are hopeless now due to high fees, which was one of the most oft-touted use-cases for bitcoins back in the day. And then we had OpenBazaar, which still exists, but which might as well not exist. Only a few hundred vendors, still, after all these years? That's a failure.
Things are looking bad right now, but I'm hoping they get better. I just don't see how the current state of things is going to have a happy ending.

Incentivizing full nodes is a good idea but I'm not sure how it would be done, because people can spin up hundreds of "fake" nodes very easily. Somehow, you need to quantify the amount of work they are doing in order to prevent people from gaming the system. Hence, proof of work, and mining... which itself has shifted to large rooms full of expensive equipment.

Keep in mind that miners aren't just competing against difficulty to find the next block, they are also competing against other miners. Blocks take time to propogate, and the network latency often causes multiple miners to solve the same block without realizing the others solved it as well. Only one miners ends up having a valid claim to a block.
If lots of miners rush in, block generation time goes down and the effect of network latency becomes more of a problem, with multiple miners solving the same blocks on a regular basis. I am not sure if this has been accounted for in predictions of profitability...
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:00:08
You have to put yourself in the miner's shoes around that time. Pretend you can't see the rest of that graph of node counts. Miners had no way of knowing it wouldn't continue to increase at that rate, and there was still 2 and a half months to go before it activated. Plenty of time to rally the troops. And at that time, Luke Jr and Peter Todd were very much in favor of it, while we hadn't heard much from the other devs. Many people thought bitcoin core would throw their weight behind it. Miners had no way of knowing that Luke Jr and Peter Todd were at odds with the rest of the devs on the recklessness or lack thereof of the UASF plan at that time (the rest of the core devs came around only very recently, after the lock-in of BIP91).
The mere threat of UASF for litecoin led to the miners calling a emergency meeting with Charlie Lee, immediately after which they all started signalling for SegWit. Many of these folks are the same miners who participate in bitcoin mining as well. They knew what the UASF represented, and feared it.
The situation that happened with bitcoin happened first with litecoin, and we got a good taste there of what the miners felt about it. They feared not just the possibility of a chain split, but the possibility of having the precedent set of activating soft forks without their direct participation.

Yeah, it's weird. Can't explain this as premining because there was ample time to decide what transactions to include (one hour after the last block). Unless they premined a block but didn't broadcast it for a long time, which doesn't make sense either.
If this keeps happening, we can can call it sabotage perhaps. But at the moment this is just a one-off event that could perhaps be incompetence or a software bug or other technical issues.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:38:49
That makes perfect sense.
And since BCC difficulty adjusts very rapidly in comparison to the legacy chain, an amount of hash power that would be tiny in the context of BTC will be more than enough, at least after a few days, for mining BCC.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:01:29
Intrinsic value exists when a thing is actually necessary for modern life as we know it. Such things tend to be natural products or their derivatives. Break out a periodic table and you'll see a lot of things there with very real intrinsic value.
Bitcoin is not really one of those things, however. It has value, like you say, because people *want* it. Not because they *need* it.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:59:08
A long adjustment period makes the system robust to being intentionally manipulated by shutting down / turning on miners over relatively short time frames.
Making difficulty adjust over a smaller number of blocks would make difficulty easier to manipulate. There's no magical threshold where it becomes a problem... so any changes to the difficulty adjustment system need to balance tradeoffs.
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:12:17
That would only work if you can limit the proof of IO to be measured between nodes controlled by different groups. So now you need proof of identity as well. Otherwise, I can put 1000 nodes on AWS and have them talk to each other to get that IO.

It's really dependent on exchanges coding up and testing things. Since the blockchains are similar and the protocols almost the same, it might be easy to think they can just cut+paste their code for Bitcoin, change the ticker symbols, and be done with it. But the similarities also make it really easy to have unintended mixups between BTC and BCH, so I expect testing to be no less involved than usual. Gotta make new colums int he db tables, modify database layer code as well.
If you're Mark Karpeles you'd probably whip that up in a day, no bother testing it, and then act surprised when you lose all your money. If you're Kraken or Coinbase or Bitfinex, you take your time, test the shit out of it, and have no money left for servers to handle all the traffic you're about to get.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:42:57
There's *some* truth to that, although a lot of hyperbole as well.
We just have to look to Ethereum, which has emergent consensus. Instead of the miners increases the gas limit preemptively, the community often has to put a lot of pressure on them to do it. So there is certainly some desire by miners to find a tradeoff between block size and fees... favoring the side of the equation that gives them more fees. They don't act out of the goodness of their hearts, and we shouldn't expect them to.
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:20:45
I disagree with the way you are supporting your argument - not the argument itself. You are focusing on an extreme (and actually impossible) edge case block size for both SegWit and SegWit2x in order to make your point.
Your point is worth making, but only if you do it honestly.
I have seen at least one bitcoin dev making *exactly* the same argument you are making here. Same numbers, same convenient equivalency of block weight and block size. So you can certainly be forgiven if you're just restating things. Unfortunately, bitcoin devs are still people with their own biases, and at least a few of them seem to spend most of their time on social media exaggerating the crap out of everything.
All that said, I support bitcoin core for the most part, and think it  is important to keep home nodes within reach of (almost) everyone who can afford a shitty computer.
But I wouldn't worry about SegWit on its own, I think nodes will manage. Well... maybe not first generation RPi nodes...

Probably none. The future of bitcoin will be decided by people, not code. Code just represents those decisions.
Well, 95% of the hash power promised to go with SegWit2x. That's not core, but it's not BCH either. If hash power rushes over to BCH they are basically going back on their word. Let's see if they do.

Depends on how you measure it.
If all transactions for a month are SegWit transactions, does it really matter that half of all bitcoins in existence haven't moved in years and are still legacy bitcoins?

No, but if that peer was only connected to me, I would be the middleman. And peers don't do proof of work. Those times are long gone.
If blockstream is setting up a system in which they operate a network that translates satellite communication to and from the bitcoin network, they are the middlemen.
I'm not saying it's bad. If it helps people, it's objectively good. It's just that there may be some tradeoffs to making the idea a reality. If blockstream is smart, they'll find a way to make it distributed so that corrupt national governments can't easily take the system down.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:59:07
There absolutely was. Once people had been yelled at enough that they were wrong, they changed their tune to that it wasn't *enough* of a block size increase. After that, that it was too cludgey, or patented, or would take too long to be adopted. Of all of the anti-SegWit rhetoric, only the concern over adoption rate is valid, IMO.
For what it's worth I believe that the first round of mass SegWit adoption will probably be done by online wallets and exchanges. I don't know how long that will take, and they'd be right to make sure to test their systems thoroughly before migrating of course. So it likely won't be right away.

"Genesis block" is the wrong terminology. The genesis block is block 0 and BCH doesn't reset the blockchain, so BCH won't have its own genesis block.
But 478559, once mined on the BCH fork, will be its first block that is unique to it. Block 478558 will be the last block in common with the legacy chain.

I would personally place most of the emphasis on "under Jihan's control". And I'd further qualify that by saying that it's not really Jihan that's the problem. It would be equally worrisome if any dominant mining corporation took the reins of development. Jihan is shit at PR and has said a lot of dumb things to make him a target of mockery, but it's monopolies that are the problem, not people.
In terms of incompetence, I'm not sure we can label the BCH devs as such. Whoever the devs are, the fork went according to plan and with no hiccups. The low block discovery rate is probably the most criticized flaw, but it was entirely expected, so part of the rollout is waiting for difficulty to slowly adjust.
That said, it may be too early to say that everything has gone to plan. There are worries that the hash rate crash protection feature may be misused by miners - if that happens, I might change my opinion on the competence of the dev team.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:24:59
I suspect it's true that BCH would reduce the feeling of urgency for big blockers.
But I expect 2x will still get support among "medium blockers", if you want to call them that, as well as people who actually want a combination of SegWit plus additional block size increases beyond what SegWit offers.
Because bitcoinABC has made the call to remove SegWit, it re-opens concerns about 3rd party transaction malleability and covert ASICBoost. That's not the best.

Today plus two and a half weeks - give or take a day because the timing is based on block counts, not actual dates and times.
So August 22nd is as good an estimate as any. Might be 21st or 23rd. And your time zone is a factor as well.
A rather precise estimate of the actual time (including time zone) is [here]( August 21st, 6:35pm GMT.

The probability of your specific genetic composition given the various ways in which your parent's chromosomes could assort was also astronomically low, yet it happened.
So, expand the alphabet soup. EC could have been BU or ABC or BCC or BCH or 8M or VIA or RV (Roger Ver) or WU (Jihan's last name) or god know what else. 148 could have been 141 or SEG or BTC or SW or 91 or god knows what else.

I have to wonder if all the mining patent litigation Bitmain has been threatening (and apparently following through with) had a role to play in turning Wang Chun against them, and SegWit2x by association.
Wang Chun has definitely been one of the more fickle miners, ready to change his stance at a moment's notice. Although it seems that has earned him some enemies, it's a better way to go about things than stubbornly sticking to your guns no matter what.

Playing devil's advocate here (I'm more or less a SegWit supporter), BU can be seen as handing that option *back* to the miners. 
Before block sizes were consistently hitting the 1 MB limit (from about 2009 to 2015), miners decided on *soft limits* for block size. Yes, that's certainly different from the *hard limit* set by Bitcoin Core, but BU supporters do not seem to care about the distinction. And perhaps to some extent, BU would look more like business as usual (an extrapolation of the steadily growing block size seen from 2009 to 2015) than it the current situation.

I have started this process but it's kind of involved, at least in my case. I do not trust Electron Cash so the first thing I did was transfer my BTC to a brand new wallet, so that when I import my private key into Electron Cash, at least I'm only risking by BCC.
That's done so now I'm figuring out how to get a loaner PC that I can install Windows on, then Electron Cash, make the transfer, and format the thing.
I actually think I'll end up running it through WINE on linux, if that works...
Edit: it seems to work through WINE. My balance in BCC is being shown but transactions going back years are showing as "not verified" even though it's been tens of thousands of blocks. Hmm. Likely a UI problem, I will send the coins anyway and see what happens.
Edit2: Kraken does not have a Bitcoin Cash deposit option (or a withdraw option), even though it's being actively traded there. It would appear that's Kraken's "support" for BCH at the moment is only via a proxy currency pair in their private ledger, and that they are not hooked into its blockchain. No go, at least for now.
Edit3: Electron Cash is connecting to legacy bitcoin nodes and seeing transactions that occurred after the fork on the legacy chain. What a mess, lol. With all these hurdles it's no wonder there hasn't been a bank run yet.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:47:52
It's still enabled on the core chain as well.
And even after SegWit activates (it hasn't yet), it will only be effectively disabled for SegWit blocks, which may not be hugely common at first.
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:57:57
It also needs to be pointed out, I think, that when bitcoin's scaling concerns were first brought up in 2009, Satoshi dismissed them entirely (though politely), by saying everything the big blockers are saying now. Make blocks larger, make full nodes powerful machines/datacenters, Moore's law, Kryder's law, etc.
We need to be honest with ourselves, that we are fundamentally disagreeing with Satoshi on this one. And that's fine as long as we have better options available (and by better, I mean just as effective but having fewer centralization concerns).
I am not a big blocker yet. I will see what SegWit + LN + Schnorr bring. Even if they don't give us all the scaling we need (I suspect they won't), they will still reduce the needed size of blocks to something hopefully less ridiculous than the triple digit MB that I've seen casually thrown around in the other sub.
Worst case scenario is that if the need for bigger blocks becomes undeniable, somebody competent and not in the pockets of miners will eventually make a fork that doesn't antagonize everybody on purpose.

The block *weight* limit is 4,000,000.
The concept of a block size limit doesn't really exist in SegWit, but with today's transaction types the block weight limit corresponds to somewhere between 2 and 3 MB. SegWit's block weight limit is very much like Ethereum's gas limit. It's an *indirect* limit on block size that changes depending on the amounts of different types of data in the transaction.
But that assumes 100% adoption of SegWit. We are seeing evidence now that this will take a while to happen, just like it takes a good long time for people to switch over to new versions of their operating system.
Still, nothing would surprise me anymore. SegWit could see nearly 100% adoption in a month, or still barely any at all, and I wouldn't be surprised either way.

UASF supporters were insanely loud on in the run up to the NYA. Every few posts were about it. And it was just as loud on twitter.
[Here's some more historical information]( It's a long article but search for the phrase "Around the same time as Russell’s post". See the chart below that? The sudden rise around "week 14"? I remember that time well because I was spent inordinate amounts of time here trying to wrap my head around how the UASF worked. The front page was full of UASF news every day for a good long while. You can see the article, written on May 22, came 6 weeks after UASF supporter's first big push, which would have happened in Mid April. That gave miners and other stakeholders at least a month and a half to respond to the very real threat of a chain split. 
[This page]( has an all-time graph of UASF growth, putting week 14's big push in perspective.
You're right. There's no mention in the NYA announcement. But you can be damned sure it was the foremost in all of their minds and the reason why they chose to activate their SegWit signalling just prior to UASF activation. Mentioning the UASF in their agreement would have just promoted it further, since they knew the text of the agreement was likely to get wide publicity.

I don't see any disrespect towards Satoshi anywhere at all. Pretty much everyone who has bothered to express an opinion about him on this forum or or even on many altcoin forums has praised his intelligence and foresight. I'm sure there's disrespect *somewhere*, but you'd have to specifically go looking for it.

First step, get them into computer science. I've worked for several IT companies and although corporations in my country like to have a fairly even split of men to women, most of the women were in management or HR. It's easier to appreciate bitcoin if you can understand how it works to some extent.
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:56:37
There is only one bitcoin, no matter how many forks occur. So saying that this has led to 42 million coins is misleading. Creating new altcoins does cause inflation in the overall cryptocurrency scene, but not within blockchains, which is what really matters.
I do not see Bitcoin Cash as being that different from other alts which started life as a modification to bitcoin. And there seem to be lots of them. The blockchain was also split, so that does add some complications. The market/community has to decide which one is "bitcoin" and seems to have done so.
I have become fairly optimistic that the community and market will resolve any and all forks reasonably gracefully. The Bitcoin Cash fork seems to be evidence of that. The fact that it seems to be co-existing with Bitcoin without causing a giant mess in the market is a good sign.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:51:39

I attempted this yesterday, with no success, because of your first point - there are no exchanges currently accepting BCH deposits. Although the price has more than doubled since, so maybe that's for the best.
I also experienced an unexpected hiccup with the Electron Cash wallet software. It initially connected to legacy nodes and showed me transactions I'd done on the legacy network after the fork! Turns out that although *capable* of connecting to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, you often have to tell it to do so, and first have to let it trigger the chain split detection, then go into the server prefs and tell it to use the Bitcoin Cash chain. These instructions are linked to from the Electron Cash website but I only knew to look for them after experiencing the problem.
The other thing is, it is uncertain whether the Electron Cash binaries are trustworthy. So I actually ran it on a separate PC than the one I normally use for bitcoin stuff. For those interested, the Electron Cash standalone binary works very well over Linux with WINE.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:48:40
At the moment, only in my imagination. They haven't even mined a block yet, and you won't be able to get your BCH onto an exchange unless they mine a block. And then five more, for the exchange to consider the transaction adequately confirmed. That will take days.
So while the fork has begun, I am not sure what all these livestreamers are planning to do for several days while they watch grass grow and paint dry...

Rejecting empty blocks would in effect require setting a *minimum* block size, or a minimum transaction number.
This would be a parameter that would need to be decided by consensus. If you say that all blocks must have 2 transactions (they always have 1, the coinbase) then miners who want to mine empty blocks will just add a small transaction. So require 3 transactions? 10? And if not implemented by all (or almost all) nodes simultaneously, such a requirement would cause a chain split.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:50:28
Yeah, it's already been pointed out. I forgot that while addresses are normally represented as alphanumeric, the block header hashes are not.
However, you can pull the same tricks that numerologists pull and represent the hash in any base you like, including converting each byte into ASCII. Representing it as hex is really just convention. When it comes down to it, it's just a number like any other.
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:32:22

Doesn't rely on counts.
Except on reddit, where the counts were used to further promote it. UASF isn't itself a sybil attack, but you can certainly sybil the appearance of public support for it. In the end, however, all that matters is the proportion of the bitcoin economic activity that is dependent on the UASF nodes.

You're right, there's a difference between the coins themselves being traceable versus being able to tie them to a specific person.
But bitcoin does not make it easy to stay anonymous - a single fairly minor slip up is all it takes.
Since they passed through shapeshift, law enforcement really have no way of pinning any blame on buyers. If you find you get some fairly old/used $1 bills, there's a good chance they were used for criminal activity as well, but that doesn't make you guilty of anything. Let's hope whoever investigates this understands that.

We can't quite write SegWit2x (8x?) off yet. It still has the same miner majority and fairly strong economic support.
The situation with BCH has shown us that even contentious hard forks will still get support by major exchanges, no doubt because they stand to profit from trading fees. Exchanges will list SegWit2x coins as well, probably much more readily due to the greater appearance of support, as long as it has replay protection.

Difficulty can be adjusted every single block for BCC/BCH, based on an entirely new thing they added called "hashrate crash protection". You can [read about that here]( But it looks like it shouldn't have kicked in yet, because it hasn't been 12 hours since 6 blocks ago.
However, I think the possibility should be considered that this new system can misbehave, which is why I am wondering if the difficulty has indeed changed.

I don't know. Some people say hash rate decides. Some people say the miners will follow the rest of the community. We're about to find out. Anyway, since we not only survived but are thriving under a recent hard fork, I'm just not worried. Either way it goes, it'll all work out fine.

Pretend you don't have access to the internet, and on top of this, don't even have access to a safe bank account or stable local currency.
There are lots of people in the world living like that, and this was one of the problems that early adopters of bitcoin hoped it would solve. But you can't have bitcoin without some sort of communication network. ISPs require lots of infrastructure, so the next step is to find a way to use some other form of communication... widespread, already in place, and not easy to disrupt.
Communication satellites seem to fit the bill.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:00:59
Miners don't make the rules, but they decide which rule sets get hashpower. Given the way bitcoin's difficulty adjustment system works, a sudden loss of 90% of the hash power on the main chain would probably outright kill it, failing some sort of hard fork to combat the situation. 
The reason being that most people use SPV clients, so they'll connect to the longest chain *regardless* of the block size. So much of the economy would automatically move over, without even making a conscious decision. Then holdout miners would likely follow.
There's not much that can be done about this, really. If the miners stick to their guns for long enough, SegWit2x will absolutely take over. What remains to be seen is how long they'll stick to their guns - because it's going to cost them a lot of money to do so at first. It also remains to be seen if they take the risk in the first place. It's easy for them to put "NYA" in their coinbase string. Harder to kiss money goodbye for who knows how long.

I've read an economics book, and all it did was shake my faith in the entire "science", because of one major assumption underlying the whole shebang: the assumption that markets behave rationally. People do not behave rationally, and markets are made up of people. Markets move wildly in various directions in response to self-fulfilling prophecies of technical analyses, with whales making decisions concerning millions of dollars on the basis of rumor. This is what underlies much of bitcoin's volatility.
But let's assume I believe it all. What exactly makes you think BCC must increase in price? Are you not aware of the plethora of undead cryptocurrencies  (extremely low market cap, but will never truly die) that fill this market?
Merely existing isn't good enough. Having some magic number block size isn't good enough. And there are plenty of detractors, too... not the least of which is that it's only "open source" in the sense that we can read the source code. Good luck actually trying to participate in development. Membership is closed and secret.

UASF was heavily promoted well in advance of the meeting that led to the NYA. The UASF timeline (activating on August 1st) is what led to the rushed timeline of the NYA - they wished to avoid the consequences of UASF enforcement by finding a way to agree to signal SegWit prior to August 1st that would also reaffirm their commitment to a 2x hard fork.

Price is speculation, and speculation doesn't actually improve bitcoin. The price could go up to $10k tomorrow and while many people would be happy, nothing fundamentally will have changed.
If the 10% of the community that had promised to actively block segwit do so, a minority will have successfully forced their goals onto a majority. That will signal that the "Democratic" nature of bitcoin is fundamentally broken. And worse, probably can't be fixed because the minority will block said attempts as well.

What's interesting is that there's a difference between "can be used" and "will be used".

I hope so because I think it would be a nice way to show people how some parts of SegWit work.
I am very curious how quickly SegWit wallets will be available, and how quickly the overall community transitions.

There's nothing freaky about this, as a reasonably large number of possibilities would have resulted in similar "whoa" reactions, even if you stick with hex. You can start to whittle that probability down closer to 1 in 10000 or something. Still not particularly likely, but not insane either.
What kind of warning shot do you suppose it would be? "We have enough hash power to find arbitrary collisions, so don't fuck with us?" That's some level of conspiracy theory.
And if that was intention, why EC and 148? BCC and 141 would have been much more "holy shit".

If he sells all his BTC simultaneously, hell yes. That's simple supply and demand. But he'd have to be a little bit mental to do that.
If he wants to sell, he should do it slowly enough so as not to directly shock the market. It would still affect some people's psychology, of course, but meh. If we wants to sell, he should. Even if it triggers a small crash, bitcoin will recover.

I don't want to put my bitcoins on an exchange. I only want to put my BCC on an exchange.
The only way to do that is to wait until *after* the fork to make the move.
This is the security-conscious thing to do, so I can't be alone in thinking that this is the correct strategy. 
For those who just want to trade on exchanges and not just dump their BCC, there's always futures.

That's true, but as adoption increases it appears like it will be increasingly difficult to make fundamental changes.
For example, if core actually did release a PoW change for possible activation, all of the arguments and strife you've seen up to now will pale in comparison to the reaction you'd get to that.
SegWit, which barely deserves any controversy whatsoever, has ultimately led to a battle in which one hard fork has already happened, and another is still planned.
Imagine what a propose PoW change would do.

No. You are confusing block weight and block size. You can only get 4 MB SegWit / 8 MB SegWit2x blocks if all of the transactions have nothing but witness data, which just doesn't happen.
During a *stress test*, a block on testnet got to 3.7 MB. That block was deliberately engineered to represent a worst case scenario of an outright attack on bitcoin. In practice, blocks will be about 2-2.5 MB under SegWit, and 4-5 MB under SegWit2x.

I guess it was silly of me to focus so strongly on only one particular human failing.
Greed is a major reason why bitcoin even has a use case: an attempt to circumvent a lot of the greed in the economic systems we have today.
But greed can also kill bitcoin, yes. If people with "my way or the highway" thinking prevent meaningful compromise from ever occurring, that would be a form of greed, no?
I honestly don't care if segwit or blocksize increase or something else ends up being put in place as a last-minute scaling solution. I would just like to see a bit of compromise and cooperation. So far most of what I've seen is three different camps flinging shit at each other, and this sub cleverly censoring dissenting opinion to make it seem like it's all roses. I'm slightly in favor of segwit in some ways, but it's not a solution to scaling so much as an enabler of an eventual solution maybe one day. And I can understand how some people don't like the idea of moving so many transactions off the blockchain.

I store my deterministic wallet mnemonic on a piece of aluminum, which I punched with those sets of alphanumeric steel punches you can get on eBay.
There's always a risk that a house fire renders that useless, in which case I also have a encrypted file containing the mnemonic backed up on cloud storage.
If my house burns down at the same time as Google's data center, I'm pretty screwed, but I figure that would require global nuclear war or a planet-killing asteroid, in which case my bitcoins won't do me much good.

It's not ideal, but it happens anyway.
Bitcoin being a protocol whose nitpicky details control the flow of real money makes it much harder to develop it in iterations. Every little tiny software change requires a pain in the ass release process. Even something as simple as changing the value of a constant.
And it's only going to get worse as it picks up steam. The devs have a shrinking window of opportunity in which to implement the majority of planned innovations to bitcoin core. Everything else after some point is likely to end up being layered on top as a completely separate protocol/service/network.

@_date: 2016-12-06 21:08:43
Fair enough. I don't think it should be easy to hard fork, but it shouldn't be easy to purposefully stall development, either. Although I don't pretend to know if that's what is happening. I'm more concerned about the fact that it's possible.
Let's say a country with strict currency controls wanted to "kill" bitcoin. They can't just outlaw bitcoin, because people evading currency controls are already breaking the law anyway. But they can play the long game - and all they need is greater than 5% of the global hashing power to stall a lot of future development.
I don't think it should be possible for such a small minority to dictate the outcome.
Yeah, rising fees are a problem.
My ideal future will involve a block size increase, including a mechanism for automatically increasing block size, as well as segwit (or something similar) to patch transaction malleability.
But that would require multiple, seemingly conflicting parties to come to terms.

Have you tried turning bitcoin off and on again?
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:15:02
I'll be honest, it's a pain in the ass right now.
Technically you already have it. The same key that gives you access to your bitcoin gives you access to your Bitcoin Cash.
What you need is a Bitcoin Cash wallet. And you need to export your private key from your existing wallet and import it into a Bitcoin Cash wallet. This is the part that sucks. It involves exporting/importing a plain-text private key or seed and working with software that may or may not deserve your trust.
Unless things have changed in the last few days the main option is a modified version of Electrum called Electron Cash. Source code is available, but unless you plan to read it all and compile it yourself, you have to trust the binaries. Trusting binaries is something I am hesitant to do when the dev(s) are entirely anonymous and not willing to put their person reputations at stake. If you know how to compile the source, I recommend doing so.
Failing that, run it on a computer that is entirely separate from your normal bitcoin transactions, and only after you first transfer your bitcoins to a brand new wallet (if you use a seed, make a new one) with confirmations. Use the old seed/private key only for bitcoin cash.
[Here's the guide that I followed](
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:11:44
Yup. Time to hurry up and wait. I'm not particularly happy about BCC/BCH/ABC but I can't deny that this is certainly providing me some manner of entertainment.
And perhaps we can finally get a completely unbiased idea of whether the "community" actually favors big blocks, as claims. If they are right, BCC/BCH/ABC should take over. If it doesn't, they've been wrong all along. Pretty clear cut result. Time to wait and see.
Could be a longish wait, though. I expect extreme volatility at first, and it won't be easy to tell what its eventual value while people and racing to take their positions, execute pump'n'dumps, etc.

I should add that I don't have a family, so I have yet to think about how I might pass this stuff on... assuming any's left by that time. I will probably end up spending it all on stuff I don't need from Newegg.
@_date: 2019-08-24 11:48:59
I consider him something of an extremist among the devs. I've never much cared for his idea of shrinking the block limit to extremely small sizes, unless he also proposed greatly decreasing block time and I wasn't paying attention. But that would do nothing except increase overhead.
@_date: 2019-08-27 12:29:56
The evidence points to early bitcoin having been the work of a single person. The code style suggested that bitcoin's first functioning iteration was written by one guy, forum posts by a single anonymous account with consistent style, etc. It all smells exactly like a hobby project.
And once again, there's no point buying a non-patented open-source project. You don't have to - copy it, for free. That's the whole point. All that can be gained from "buying" an open source project is trademarks/branding, but the "bitcoin" name is not trademarked, and in its early years the name had zero reputation to utilize anyway.
Regarding your last sentence, that is absolutely true of course, but there's no good evidence that he was even involved marginally. Without that, we should adopt a default position that he probably wasn't.
@_date: 2016-12-06 16:33:44
Trust matters, but litecoin and bitcoin are extremely similar. Litecoin is a fork of bitcoin with damned minor changes. Both are time tested and both are technically "trustworthy", excepting differences in the size of the network and the level of robustness that comes along with that. Eg, it's easier to 51% attack litecoin just because you don't need as much computing power.
I don't think bitcoin retains its market share simply because people trust it. The majority of people using bitcoin don't seem to understand it. I've met many of these people in real life. They buy it as a speculative investment or just because they think it's cool and want to send a few transactions around to see what happens.
Bitcoin retains its market share because of the network effect. But that can't last forever if it becomes increasingly shitty as a result of higher fees and longer transaction times.
@_date: 2019-08-27 10:24:16
The buyer of what? Bitcoin is a non-patented open-source project. There is nothing there to sell. Project coordinator? Tester? I consider it unlikely that bitcoin was developed by a well-structured team with such roles in the first place, until it went open-source (after which we have a good history of involvement and know who did what).

UASF wasn't being made fun of so much as criticized for being reckless. It could have split the chain.
[Jihan was already prepping his response to the UASF threat in early April](
[Bitmain later explained their feelings about UASF in some detail](
If you were active in the litecoin community during its segwit activation, you would have seem all this shit happen before. Litecoin and bitcoin pretty much have the same miners, by the way.
So miners have twice now reacted to UASF by carefully timed agreements involving signalling SegWit. You could call that coincidence if you want, but having experience both of these events, it definitely did not feel like coincidence at the time.

Consider this: I once lived in a strata high-rise with a major water ingress problem. The problem had been brewing for years. Original estimates for repairs were in the upper 6 figures, but more money than was available in the contingency funds. So the repair bill would be split a few hundred ways and levied against all owner's accounts. Somewhere around $3 or $4k per suite. It involved concrete repairs and cleaning out an obstructed drainage system.
A 75% supermajority would be required to start repairs on the building. As you can expect, it never happened. People didn't want to pay that much money to fix things. Year after year, it was voted down.
Then one day the city comes in and says - fix it now, or we condemn the building. The damage had progressed to the point where large chunks of concrete were falling from the parkade and had the potential to injure people and damage vehicles. Oh, and the repairs would now cost $2 million because the parkade was no longer repairable and had to be rebuilt. Each of us had to pay 5 figures in repair bills. Most of us had to sell or get second mortgages to afford it.
Supermajorities are a near guarantee that nothing remotely controversial will ever happen at all. And whether something is "controversial" often has no bearing on common sense. People are greedy and want things to happen or not happen for reasons that are actually a detriment to the group or long term situation. Bitcoin's major failing is that, like all democratic processes, it assumes the actors will be rational. As a general rule, humans are not rational.
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:39:01
You don't seem to understand. When you encrypt a private key, the result is no longer a private key. At no point is a raw private key being stored on Google drive.
Obtaining the private key would require brute force cracking the encrypted string. Because of the encryption algorithm I'm using, each single attempt would take several seconds on typical hardware. Doing this would not even be feasible for an entire nation.
Similarly, you can in theory brute force crack bitcoin public keys in order to determine what the private key is. Similar risk.
You either trust strong encryption, or you don't.

Literally the only objective metric we have of BTC vs S2X at the moment is the futures market.
However, qualitatively, it's very clear that the legacy BTC chain has a majority of support *among those who are actively participating in the discussion*. The slow bleed of organizations pulling out of the NYA suggests also that the "silent majority" may be wishful thinking among S2X supporters.
So it's a mistake to just pull a 99% figure out of nowhere, but it's possible to get a qualitative sense of where the majority support lies.

Another way is to know more about the software you used to generate your address. For example, the newest Trezor firmware defaults to creating P2SH-based SegWit addresses, and you have to go out of your way to create "legacy" addresses. Electrum asks if you want a SegWit address or not.
If you made your address long ago, before SegWit activated, it's probably not a SegWit address.

Problem is, needing to know how many coins are in active circulation is a basic requirement for calculating market cap in the first place. What good is an easy-to-understand number when it's completely inaccurate? 
Everyone is just using the number of minted coins, which is going to lead to an inflated market cap, and who knows by how much. I wouldn't be surprised if 75% of all bitcoins haven't budged since this time last year. I tried to find said statistics - which could be obtained from the blockchain - but so far no luck.

Well I'm sure Luke still wants *smaller* blocks but I kind of just nod and smile when he says such things. I accept his quirks and occasional disagreements with other devs as a good indication that the core dev team has some healthy difference of opinion.
For bitcoin to scale, larger blocks will have to enter the equation at some point. But they alone can't lead to scaling, and they need to be rolled out carefully.
Because of their history and accumulated experience, it will probably require support (if not direct spearheading) by core. If they reject a proposal on technical grounds, it has little hope of being broadly accepted. And honestly, a simple flag day might be the best way. One year warning. Maybe let miners activate it early, but never again give them veto power.

Core devs say they weren't invited, Erik Voorhees says they were. It's one guy's word against another, with little evidence offered either way as far as I can see.
Besides, core devs attending such meetings is pretty useless due to their governance model. Look at what happened with the HK agreement - a few core devs showed up, and even agreed they would plug away at the problem (which they did), but they can't speak on behalf of all the other core devs. And because you can't just commit code to bitcoin core without first going through a peer review process, all that these devs could do was put a BIP up. And the majority of BIPs never get implemented.
Bitcoin core doesn't have a central authority who can attend these meetings, sign something, and then tell the other devs "this is what we must do". So at best the presence of a few core devs at such events would accomplish nothing more than offering a critique of the agreement, which wasn't even fleshed out from a technical point of view until *after* it was signed.
If the signatories had instead just submitted a BIP, they would have received exactly the same critique anyway, and would have made a better impression but not attempting to circumvent the existing review process.

That's not how these hacks work.
First, a raw database is stolen. [Almost 5 billion accounts across multiple services]( have been affected. Myself, personally, have had 4 separate data theft incidents, one which required me to change credit card numbers and get credit reports to check for identity theft.
Not all of these services properly hash your passwords. Sometimes they are not properly salted, so if a single account is compromised, suddenly many are. Sometimes, a hashing algorithm is used that reveals data about the password, such as password length. Other times, user-provided password hints are stored along with the hashed password. Adobe was a somewhat high profile case, and they made all of these mistakes simultaneously.
You don't brute-force the passwords over the internet through the login page. You directly hash candidate passwords and compare them to the stolen database hashes. All offline. This has been the way it's been done forever. Software exists for doing this for you. Some is dictionary based, some tries random combinations of characters.
Obviously, you go after the low hanging fruit. People who decide to use a single word as their password, for example, or just 8 characters. Hell, some web services have very stupid maximum limits on password length that make it trivial to brute force them if the DB is ever stolen. And DBs are stolen all the time.
rbtc users probably never did any of this themselves. Someone (and not necessarily a rbtc loyalist) probably just purchased the data and/or leased an existing botnet.

I hope they don't let miners veto. If it's an opt-in soft fork, why even bother with an activation threshold in the first place? Set a flag day and move on. The people who want it will use it, the people who don't won't. Pretty simple.

Depends. Did the main promoters say "Linux X is the original Linux", use linux.com to suggest that Linux X is the original Linux, and spam the Linux forums promoting their fork and arguing with people trying to point this out?
And like I said, it's a flawed analogy. Apples and oranges because Linux distros have a completely different set of concerns than cryptocurrencies. Any given cryptocurrency needs to maintain a consistent history of transactions associated with a given identifier. So, what we call "Bitcoin" in 100 years should simply be an extension of the chain we have now, no part of which rewrites history. This what being immutable is all about. 
Once a fork occurs you have only a small number of blocks to get consensus for your fork in order to call it "bitcoin" - whatever number of blocks is considered acceptable for a re-org (historically, that has been 6 blocks). If you can't do that, you have an altcoin. BCH became an altcoin long ago. So there are definitely some BCH supporters who are being rather dishonest by telling people that it's literally bitcoin.
So, is that an attack? I believe so. But not all BCH supporters are part of this attack. In fact, the vast majority of them may not be.

Both are changes that would improve the efficiency and privacy of on-chain transactions.
[Schnorr signatures]( would allow multiple digital signatures to be combined into one, saving space in the block chain. This is particularly beneficial for multisig transactions.
[MAST]( (Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees) enable new kinds of complex transactions *without* additional overhead (or, allow some existing kinds of transactions to be done with less overhead). For example, one thing it could be used for is making massively-multisig addresses that don't chew up any more blockchain space than regular P2SH addresses. So if large, complex multisig addresses become popular, MAST would save a decent amount of blockchain bloat. Another thing it lets you do is split if/else constructs into multiple scripts that are each hashed into a single MAST, and only the applicable part of the if/else  script needs to be recorded in the blockchain to spend from a P2SH address. This saves blockchain space and increases privacy to some extent.
Neither are going to be amazingly huge transformations of bitcoin IMO, but together and in combination with other technologies they will be part of a more complete approach to scaling.
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:49:45
Well, [this]( looks exactly like a pump'n'dump. Used to see them all the time with litecoin, which is/was very easy for people to manipulate.
Pump'n'dumps generally are started by a few large investors, but work because lots of other people join in (without knowing they're been taken for a ride) as the price rises. When the big investors get out, price nosedives, but what it does after depends on all the other people too.
And the big whales can start another cycle even before the previous has even ended. So another pump could start at any time. Or this may be the last one for a while. Or there may be another, but only after it crashes more, and the next won't surpass the current market price. It's impossible to know in advance and if you try trading this, you're probably just gambling.

Custodial exchanges should not be required to deal with every random fork that occurs, and when BCH first happened it was pretty damned random - it happened shortly after being announced and there wasn't much of a push to get people to support it. The whole reason it's popular now (long after the fork occurred) is because S2X failed.
That said, a somewhat easier solution than adding new trading pairs would be to allow users to send their forked coins to their own private keys, but not deposit or trade them. But this would still require integration with a new node, or at least using someone else's API to check balances and initiate transactions on the forked chain.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:38:58

Bitcoin is being used for long-term savings perhaps even moreso than a currency. What proportion of bitcoins that exist are in *active circulation*? That's what you need to know, which is why I said "value exchanged per unit time". With stocks and currencies the assumption is that the proportion in active circulation is roughly the same from one to the next, because they get used the same way. But you wouldn't compare the market cap of a stock to the market cap of a currency (except for fun). Similary, bitcoin seems to be in a class all to its own. If you want to compare it to a currency, you need to compare only the subset of the bitcoin ecosystem that actually uses it as such. So, subtract all non-currency usage, including lost coins and long-term hodlers.
And then you have to ask questions like whether to only count the on-chain transaction volume or also include off-chain trades over exchanges. It's a giant mess.
Still, if you were to look at the last month of bitcoin's on-chain transaction volume in USD, and find an equivalent metric for the USD, you'd have something much more satisfying than market cap.

4 MB blocks can only exist if transactions consist of nothing but witness data.
With a mix of both witness and non-witness data, I believe they'll be closer to 3 MB.
As I understand it, most of the overhead comes from using P2SH transactions, which is sort of a necessary burden for doing advanced scripting and supporting stuff like LN.
And there are other ideas in the pipeline for making more efficient use of that space, as I said. It's not happening quickly, to be sure, but few solidly built things get assembled in a rush.

If you're basing that on market cap, then you're doing it wrong. Bitcoin's "market cap" has absolutely nothing to do with circulating value, which is what you actually need to know.

Choosing your node software *is* choosing the protocol. I hope you aren't advocating that non-technical people "vote" on BIPs, after which devs are somehow forced to implement them?
If you can't convince the whole network, you have an altcoin, yes. That's the way it *must* work to prevent hostile takeovers.


Not sure if you've noticed, but bitcoin mining is highly geographically centralized, and a single corporation makes practically all of the mining hardware. You can fit the people responsible for 95% of bitcoin's hash rate into a public bathroom handicap stall.


That's why that core development is reluctant to release hard forks


Democracy will destroy bitcoin. Bitcoin only survives as a meritocracy. Technical opinions expressed by non-technically minded people are not valid.
I kind of seems like you haven't thought this through critically. Imagine asking the public to vote on the design of bridges and skyscrapers right down to to the fine details. Shit would fall down.

An economic node is a somewhat hazy concept, but basically it's one that generates transactions as opposed to merely relaying them. If you use your own personal node to send bitcoins, it is an economic node at that moment in time.
The biggest economic nodes are of course those run by exchanges and payment processors. The choices made by these nodes could make all the difference since a decent proportion of all the actively traded bitcoin value either starts or ends at such nodes.

But it's very easy to be radicalized by this forum (or the other one for that matter). Hell, when the UASF movement was happening, even a few of the core devs were a little nuts about it.

I'd love to talk more about use cases like microtransactions, smart contracts, international remittance, and replacing PayPal, but some of those use cases are literally impossible right now. I am happy, however, that people are trying to find ways to make them possible again even with small blocks.
Although I spend much of my time here rolling my eyes at the big blockers, I will grant that it's been a little bit disheartening to see the community postpone the dream of p2p electronic cash in favor of a store of value.
Like the big blockers, I am at least as interested in that "original vision" as I am in a "store of value". Unlike them, however, I think the only way to get there that doesn't sacrifice long term sustainability for short term gains is to maintain bitcoin's underlying decentralization and instead scale through a multi-tiered system.
There is promising stuff in store for bitcoin, but a large part of me does hope that as technology continues to improve, the core devs do consider a block size increase hard fork one of these days. I'm not saying now. Such a thing shouldn't be rushed. But ~3 MB is not going to do the job forever. At the same time, a one-time increase is just kicking the can, as they say. Might be time to look at what Ethereum is doing with the flexible gas limit and (if it works) sharding and consider something along those lines.

I'm already using it. The exchanges are taking their sweet time at implementing it (understandable since the huge majority of their business is conducted off-chain). And progress is apparently hampered by a rather minimal API for segwit built into the core client software.
Yup, it's taken far long than I expected. I was assuming that exchanges and wallets would have new versions ready to go immediately upon SegWit activation, because it's been available on testnet for what, two years? But it looks like these companies were waiting to see if it activated before even looking into integration in the first place. Again, understandable - developing for testnet for features that aren't activated yet is risky. If they don't activate, it's wasted effort.

There's what you wish it was... and then there's reality. And reality is that it's actually mostly digital gold at least until the lightning network hits critical mass.
Furthermore, as an asset, bitcoin can't be seized by governments, and is more liquid than many physical assets. It's really in a sweet spot for helping these people out, and you're doing people a disservice by trying to discourage that.

Uh... you forgot the part about adding a new currency pair to your platform, which might even require changes to database structure (never something to take lightly) if your devs didn't plan for the ease of doing so. Then you have to add logic for two-way replay protection because S2X doesn't have it. All of this requires both back-end and front-end changes. Then you have to QA, QA, and QA some more. At least three distinct technical teams involved probably for days if not weeks making this all work properly.
And that's ignoring all the other, non-technical stuff that mentioned.

That's all true, but Linux Mint doesn't try to pretend to be Ubuntu, even though it contains a lot of the same code.
Moreover, the profit incentives just aren't the same. Linux distros don't have to be secured via expensive hashing equipment whose operators stand to make a profit by exploiting dynamics between the different distros.
If something like that did exist in the Linux world, you can bet that there would be just as much drama and politics as here. Maybe more.
So you're comparing apples and oranges.
So, I'll offer a better analogy - poaching clients from your ex-employer. That's what Ver is attempting to accomplish by running bitcoin.com, promoting the shit out of BCH on it, and saying that Bitcoin Cash is the real bitcoin.

Setting up mesh networks has been tried. It doesn't work in rural areas and you still rely on substantial infrastructure to bridge continents. Satellites don't work nearly as well - too much latency.
That said, it could certain be a way to reduce costs within cities. However, there are challenges associated with this idea due to radio interference regulations. Signal strength and frequency is highly regulated so as to prevent people from jamming their competitors' signals, or even accidentally interfering with critical infrastructure.

As I said, it did on Bitfinex. The charts are available on cryptowat.ch or with whoever else archived that data. Bitfinex was a bit aberrant, however. It did not get that low on other exchanges. I guess a big whale or two sold on Bitfinex, but the flash crash didn't last long enough to make as much a dent on the other exchanges.
This is why, if you ever decide to make a bet on the price of bitcoin, state the exchange to use (or maybe bitcoinaverage). And also what happens if that exchange goes belly up before the time frame of the bet passes! Well, if all you're betting is reddit gold it hardly matters, but people have bet for far more...

You do not brute force the passwords through reddit. You obtain the hashed passwords from stolen DBs and brute force them offline. Alternatively, just use malware and phishing to get reddit account names/passwords directly.

Sheldon might qualify as autistic, but I'm no psychologist.
Most of the diagnosed autistic students I've met almost have the opposite problem that Sheldon does - instead of being introverted, they were very chatty even with random people. They'd get along very well in parties, but they couldn't pick up on social cues when people were preoccupied or trying to break off a conversation.
It's a strange disorder, because when severe it seems to have the opposite effect, leading to reclusive tendencies and a lack of verbal communication. All things considered, Sheldon got lucky.

Deflationary currencies can discourage impulse buys, but not purchases that are required to maintain your standard of living. The main difference vs inflationary systems is that people with savings wouldn't get screwed over by rampant inflation.
Hell, even GDP wouldn't suffer, because all that capital gains from savings would just be another source of income as far as the government is concerned. To offset reduced consumerism, corporations would simply hold savings and benefit from the deflation. The politicians would still get to point to growing GDP and pretend it was thanks to them, everyone would have the same or higher standard of living, but there would be less rampant consumerism filling up the landfills with crap. Merchants who sell less from reduced consumerism would still make up for it in capital gains.
This is what our society needs, as far as I'm concerned. Realize that happy, financially independent citizens are preferable to those living paycheck to paycheck whose houses are full of crap they don't use. I'm *very* happy that my bitcoins are there as a huge (if somewhat illiquid) emergency fund in case of god knows what, and I've bought gaming laptops, guitars, electronic components, VPN access, steam games, and god knows what else with them. I have no regrets.
And the actual deflationary rate of bitcoin is fairly low. The huge rise you're seeing these days is some combination of adoption and speculation and liquidity spikes. Not actually deflation. These are things that WILL become less pronounced as bitcoin truly goes mainstream and becomes more liquid.

It might take longer to get consensus for any HF from core than it would to just wait for difficulty to adjust. Such a HF would probably have to be preventative, and IMO what BCH just did with their new DAA is an option that's on the table. 
But no matter the original intended purpose of such a fork, any HF promoted by core would probably become fodder for arguments over what else to stuff in there. Larger blocks, change to DAA, [anything from this list]( etc. Since hard forks are probably going to be a rare event for bitcoin core, there will be pressure to "make it count". And the more changes you cram in there, the more time it will take for development and testing, and the greater chance that something becomes controversial/political.

Yeah, I figured as much. Satellite internet has been available for a while and I've not heard a single good thing about it. LEO might give you better signal strength and lower latency but you also reduce the visibility of the satellites, so if you want a large coverage area you have to launch a lot of them at extreme expense.

Well, Segwit is going to require about 3 MB of data transfer per block with close to 100% adoption, so keep that in mind. It's already a minor increase in block size - you want to add more, but how many additional minor increases until you have something beyond reasonable?
It's not just per-block bandwidth, either. It's also the entire block chain, which continues to grow rapidly. It's also memory and CPU required to validate blocks as they come in.
Sure, it may seem comical to want to run bitcoin nodes on Raspberry PIs, but it's actually possible and *currently* works reasonable well. But you should see how annoyingly time consuming it is to actually download and verify the blockchain even on a high end PC. Once you get up and running it's fine, but that initial step can seem insurmountable.
Technology improves, but if care is not taken, the blockchain will grow more quickly than the rate of technological improvement, leading to ever-increasing barriers to running a full node.
The reason why LN is so exciting to many of us is because it allows a lot of scaling with only a little extra block space used. These are the sorts of solutions we should use first, before deciding to increase the block size further.

It's really hard to say.
The fact that the logo is black means that there will be less signal to noise ratio, and exaggerated noise as pretty much all digital cameras are much less sensitive in dark areas. This will cause the jpeg compression to have higher error in dark areas since JPEG is poorly suited to preserving the hard-edged pixel noise that is more prevalent there.
Light areas, in contrast, should have much higher signal to noise ratios, less noise, and lower ELA.
Any hard edges, whether photoshopped or not, will have high ELA.

My reddit account was not affected, but I just checked  and my e-mail address and hashed passwords were leaked in four separate incidents. Adobe, LinkedIn, BTC-e, and Nexus Mods. Had I used weak passwords, and used the same passwords across multiple accounts, I'd have been screwed.
One of those, BTC-e, is a Bitcoin exchange. Good place to harvest usernames and passwords that may also have been used on reddit, right here on this sub.
According to that website, more than 4 *billion* account credentials have been leaked. One of the larger shitfests was Adobe, who stored passwords improperly, allowing them to be "brute forced" insanely easy. Oh, they also stored the password hints right beside them, hah. [Here, have fun](
Brute forcing 8 character passwords is dead easy. Getting 6 characters was dead easy with software called Jack the Ripper back in the late 90s, on a 400 mhz machine. And that's not even using dictionary lookups - we're talking completely random characters. It took a few hours.

No they don't, because nodes do not automatically update. The people who run the nodes, including miners and non-miners, control what bitcoin is.


You need someone(s) to compile source code into a centralized repository even if you have multiple devs, so there is a certain amount of inescapable centralization. But just having multiple devs who don't always agree is pretty decentralized and as good as you're likely to ever get.


Which is what we already have. You vote by installing the node software you want onto your node.

We can do all of those things. But being a secure store of value is more important. That is the characteristic that enables its use as a currency in the first place.
What happened is that bitcoin adoption by speculators and savers grew very quickly. Perhaps too quickly. That is what is currently filling up the blocks for the most part. Even Satoshi was well aware of how rapid adoption could cause a mess when he asked Wikileaks NOT to use it as their currency of choice, because it just wasn't ready yet.
Core has a roadmap to enable much higher transaction throughput *without* sacrificing any of the base layer's security, but this does rely on other people doing a lot of work (eg, coding up Segwit support and smart contracts for lightning networks).
If you don't like that roadmap, there are competing altcoins attempting to accomplish similar scalability in other ways. Ethereum, for example, is planning on sharding, which would vastly increase throughput at the expense of some base security, and also planning on PoS, which would lower the barrier to entry for "mining" to anyone with a shitty computer.
There is no such thing as a scaling roadmap without tradeoffs. Find the tradeoffs that are right for you, and leave the rest of us in peace.

Haha, that calculator (or something similar) probably cost me money, although it's hard to say how much, and laziness was certainly a factor.
Back when bitcoin was relatively inexpensive, I was considering buying 10 block erupters to plug into a USB hub for mining bitcoin, but I calculated that it would take months just to pay off the cost of the block erupters. So, I realized it would be much better at the time to just buy the bitcoins. But it took me more than a year to get around to it due to KYC requirements and some oddly shady foreign currency cash deposit method used by Vault of Satoshi. At which point the price of bitcoin was only weeks away from the pre-Goxxing ATH.

There was once a time when you could count the number of alts on one hand, and bitcoin's market share was like, 90%. So there was relatively little talk about alts, certainly not as much mass spam promoting it like we see now. There was no need to clamp down on promotion of altcoins, because it hadn't turned into a giant mess of a problem yet.
You know what the spammers are doing now that they can't get away with posting their BS here? Now they PM people. I get PMs trying to convince me to buy into vertcoin, monero, dash, ripple, and the like. The other day someone PMed me with a promotion for a new exchange.
This place would be nothing but spam without heavy moderation.

Odd that $8k is proving to be such a strong psychological barrier. $10k, I can definitely see as being a much stronger barrier. Wouldn't be too surprised if we see $10k before the end of the year, however.
On the other hand, this is bitcoin, so... wouldn't be too surprised to see $5k again, either.

SegWit hasn't even reached 20% adoption, and until it gets close to 100% we haven't exceed the potential transaction capacity.
Although I'm going to guess that adoption would grow to meet capacity anyway, well beyond ANY solution that will be implemented in the near future. Attempts to bring capacity up to exceed demand would require extreme centralization of full nodes and SPV for everyone else.

Trezor or Ledger is best for secure storage and transactions. If you don't have enough bitcoin to justify buying a hardware wallet, I recommend Electrum - as long as you can keep your computer secure and free of malware.
For purchasing bitcoin, take your pick of exchange - they all suck to various extents. Get your coins outta there and onto Trezor/Ledger as quickly as possible.
If you want to actively trade, eg daytrade... well... research the shit out of possible exchanges and the histories of incidents and/or utter lack of customer support before you decide.

Yes. When you send a transaction, they know where it came from - they see your public key. They can then look up that public key in basically any blockchain explorer and see your current and historical holdings as well as any other transfers you made.
That is assuming you store all your bitcoins in a single address. If you instead split it up into many, you gain some plausible deniability that you could consider a form of privacy.
Some cryptos exist purely to solve this problem. And proposed changes to bitcoin (confidential transactions) would solve it here as well. The extent to which you consider this a problem that needs solving is up to you.

As a core supporter and opponent of BCH I am going to have to disagree with you. Again. It didn't "backfire" - it did exactly what it was meant to do. The goal of the new DAA was to ensure mean block times of 600 seconds, not to dethrone the profitability of Bitcoin mining. Not everything is an attack, you know.
The DAA used by BCH will be more variable than Bitcoin's over short time frames, but it's been drastically tamed versus the situation before. You should be thanking them for that - they actually did us (and them) a favor here.
Caveat: it hasn't really been in the wild long enough to know *for sure* that's working as planned, however. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:32:59
Really? Because if people actually used it, we'd have ~ 3MB blocks right now, and the groundwork for a few more on-chain efficiency increases to make better use of that space (MAST and Schnorr signatures). SegWit also addresses quadratic scaling for long-term improvements to scale, and patched 3rd party transaction malleability, which was a somewhat annoying security hole.
How, after all these years, do people still not know what the hell SegWit does?

Bitcoin only has a strong claim to being a currency if it's actually used that way to a great extent, which it currently is not. Yeah, I've bought stuff with bitcoin, but ironically the merchant I did business with before no longer accepts it (Newegg Canada).
But it can become what you want it to be - that requires much more non-speculative adoption, which in turn will require bitcoin scale well beyond its current transaction throughput. Like I said, I am rather hopeful this will all happen anyway. So your point will eventually ring true, but for the time being it's a bit questionable.

SegWit fixes/improves a LOT of things. If the BCH guys implement a bunch of "simpler" solutions for each one of those things, they'll end up building something just as complex or moreso than SegWit.

Yeah, I can see that. However, the flipside is that a truly anonymous/private/obfuscated blockchain that attracts the attention of government and/or law enforcement will be literally attacked using every method at their disposal that they can justify to the public.
Bitcoin as it is right now still lets uncle Sam figure out that you owe capital gains taxes, and still lets law enforcement snoop through sequences of transactions to track things down (as OP did here).
I still think it's worth doing, but the propaganda and technical attacks that will be thrown at bitcoin should it go that route will make it hard for large multinational companies to adopt it anyway.

Hmm, yeah, in many cases I agree. Many regulations are just overcomplicated, unnecessary, and almost seem to exist only to justify the jobs or satisfy the egos of the people who worked on them.
I'm definately libertarian leaning, but I don't go all the way to "no regulations at all". I brought up negative externalities (eg, pollution, health impacts, etc) and tragedy of the commons as reasons why I consider some government regulation necessary.
The loss of net neutrality regulation *without* the simultaneous abolishment of other regulations that prop up telecomm monopolies will be a disaster. So a good strategy is to support net neutrality regulation (not necessarily as it currently exists) while fighting against regulations that promote telecomm monopolies. Once other battles are won, and a free market does exist, only then would net neutrality regulation be unnecessary.

There's nothing magical about ASICs, you know. Whether ASIC, GPU, or CPU, you needs lots of money to manufacture. Nvidia and AMD have had decades to build out their expertise and infrastructure, and CPU manufacturers have had even longer.
The good news is that as long as bitcoin stays as valuable as it is, people will notice. As people notice, they'll see potential profit for selling shovels to the miners. More and more ASICs will be built.
Sooner or later some wonderful bastards is going to create a repo for an open source ASIC design. Don't think it will be these guys, though... they say they are considering open sourcing the board and software, but they don't mention anything about the ASIC chip itself.

Ethereum's claim to very high tx/s is based on eventual implementation of sharding.
It is currently limited to closer to 15 tx/s.

It seems like pretty much every popular exchange or crypto service out there has shitty customer service. You've done what you needed to do, and they've promised a refund, so I wouldn't get too anxious. As far as I know they are not a scammy company, so there's no reason to doubt their promise.
That all being said, these services are centralized crypto-banks that do hold the private keys of the wallets that are intermediate between your sending and receiving addresses. I'm really looking forward to some futuristic implimentation of atomic swaps. I know it won't be a panacea, but for compatible cryptos it could be awesome.

Those ISPs in the 90s were, as you suggest, in a grey area of selling services that piggybacked off of private infrastructure that they leased. And it was slow, low-bandwidth (dialup) service. I once worked for a local ISP and they ran the operation out of a tiny storefront. They provided dialup internet service to probably 5k customers. Mom and pop operation to say the least. Yes, those days are gone, and that sucks, but is it even possible to run a "Mom and Pop" Fiber Optic ISP?
No doubt regulations make that much harder than it needs to be, but there is undoubtedly still huge barriers to entry from infrastructure requirements as well.
In my country (Canada), there are many small, local ISPs, so it would seem that our regulatory framework is more permissive. In my town, I have a choice between at least 8 ISPs. Or so it appears on the face. But most are re-sellers of Rogers (cable) or Bell Aliant (DSL/Fiber) service.
On the opposite side of the country, I again had 2 choices: Telus (DSL) or Shaw (cable), with a small number of re-sellers. Dialup service is still available in many places. The company I used to work for still exists and is now offering Cable and DSL plans as well as enterprise web hosting.
So perhaps the reason I don't quite understand the situation in the USA is because it's not taken to quite the same extreme in Canada. Consequently, I am not as anti-regulation as I might otherwise have become. Perhaps I should stay out of USA politics, because I'm pretty unfamiliar with it.
Nevertheless, our ISP oligopoly doesn't sound much better than your ISP monopoly. An interesting thing about all of these "choices" we have is that they never get into price wars, the prices never come down, and if you compare internet plans between them, they are basically identical. Suspicious, isn't it? Doesn't smell like competition to me.

Well, not immediately, not quickly, and not conclusively. But it's the most popular sitcom in North America (excluding the population of Reddit). It will do two things: remind people that bitcoin exists, and make a lot of them go "holy shit, it's worth *WHAT* now?"
Just take note, that if the price does anything *immediately* after the episode airs, that is the doing of people who were already very much watching bitcoin and had money on exchanges. The journey from seeing bitcoin mentioned on TV to learning more about it to getting funds on an exchange is not a short journey. Not through regulated exchanges, anyway - and that's what newbies will be using.
IMO it could easily have a negative short-term effect on price and a positive long-term effect but we'll never know because you can't easily identify cause and effect in the market.

This has the potential to cause actual loss of funds for people who aren't up to speed on the situation.
It's only a matter of time before someone who thinks their BCH are literally bitcoin loses them by sending them to a merchant or exchange that accepts bitcoin, but not BCH.

I have seen it get so bad that people contemplated suicide. For real. That was months after Mt Gox imploded on itself.
Things can get bad, we know this. But we also know that the underlying technology is only changing for the better. We know that the lightning network is now running on alpha on testnet. We know that others are experimenting with side chains, Rootstock, and cofidential transactions. There are some very promising reasons to think that a lot of this speculation could eventually give way to actual mass adoption.
If you need the money, sell. If you can afford to wait out a bear market, however... it may very well be well worth it. The bear market after Gox lasted about 2 years. It was not an easy time. But it was also a time where we all reflected on bitcoin not as an investment, but as a technological revolution. Perhaps it's time for another cycle of that, because when the entire front page is nothing but price memes, I question whether the market even truly understands what it's buying.

As a bitcoin holder (and spender), I look at the charts today and am happy enough. BCH can do whatever it wants, I don't care. If the pumpers want to risk losing money on their little games, who am I to stop them? Once the coin has established a reputation as being a pump'n'dump, it will have a hard time being taken seriously. 
If you want to dethrone bitcoin, throwing your competing crypto's reputation under the bus is a strange way to do it. So that strategy suggests to me that the people pumping BCH don't seem to care about its long term success. They just want to make a quick buck.
We have clear signs of emerging mining competition, and over the long term I see the situation actually getting much better. Keep all this in mind, and soon you'll find yourself laughing instead of being angry at these attacks. Not only are they futile, the more they fail to dethrone bitcoin the more confidence I have in it.

I'm hedging, just not with BCH. If the community decides they want to take a step backwards to a less secure implementation still vulnerable to 3rd party transaction malleability, ASICBoost, and which encourages out-of-control bloat of the blockchain, then it's goodbye bitcoin for me. I get why people want a quick fix to realize "Satoshi's Vision", but all they're accomplishing through this quick fix is making an even bigger problem for the future.

Yeah, I agree that regulation often is a giant barrier to entry. We can see that at work even within the Bitcoin economy - look at what the bitlicense did to many NY-based crypto businesses.
But regulation is often created to solve problems. For example, look at most typical devices with radios and you'll see stamped markings about how they conform to various regulations placed on radio interference. Without such regulations, corporations could deliberately interfere with their competitor's signals with impunity. Or it would permit poorly made equipment purchased by your neighbor to jam up your wifi signal entirely unintentionally. And regulation is probably necessary to deal with negative externalities and the tragedy of the commons.
But regulation is corruptible. You need a very well working system to maintain it and to resist the influence of special interest groups. That seems unrealistic. But perhaps less unrealistic that hoping that literally all regulation is simply abolished.
I dunno, it's kind of a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" scenario, IMO.

Yeah, that's true. I do have to wonder how it would have all gone down had core decided to use a hard-fork to implement those changes.

SegWit isn't a fork in the sense that you're probably thinking. It's opt-in, so it's up to everybody to make a conscious effort to transition over. Even once Bitfinex implements it, you still need to send/receive using SegWit addresses for that to matter.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:20:56
You're correct, bitcoin is approaching max capacity. An upgrade was recently activated (SegWit) that can double this capacity, but it is taking time for SegWit adoption to occur. SegWit2x would have doubled this capacity again, but it was very controversial, and due to the way it was built, it was unsafe to deploy without near-unanimous support. 
Scaling beyond SegWit is still in the R&amp;D state. The closest major solution, quite possibly a game changer, is the lightning network. I say "the" lightning network, but it's entirely possibly for multiple such networks to emerge. A lighting network leverages bitcoin's ability to run certain types of smart contracts and will allow nodes to securely exchange value many times using a much smaller number of transactions. However, if this works as promised, it could lead to much more demand for bitcoin, so to a certain extent additional capacity is probably going to be eaten up right away. Of course, that can be considered a good problem to have.
To scale even further, you can combine the lightning network with either large blocks, or more efficient use of block space, or both. One or both will probably be necessary in the medium to long term.
At the moment, technical opposition to larger blocks is due to concerns over centralization that will be caused by bandwidth use and blockchain bloat. Bitcoin is currently suffering through some moderate amount of mining centralization, so we are understandably hesitant to do anything which encourages more centralization. Another concern is about *who* is behind the attempted forks so far, and perceptions (perhaps quite justified) of ulterior motives.
Making more efficient use of the existing block space appears to be core's current approach. Ideas like [MAST]( and [Schnorr signatures]( can help, especially as bitcoin moves to being used more and more for scripts and multisig transactions.
To conclude, none of this happens quickly. LN, MAST, and Schnorr are complex ideas that will require much R&amp;D and testing. Although the price has certainly benefited from fairly rapid adoption, this did not give bitcoin devs enough time to stay on top of things, and two years of infighting over SegWit made things much worse.
Things are likely to get worse before they get better, but there is relief in sight.

Bitcoin Core has *not* thrown their weight behind the UASF yet. Who knows if they ever will.

UASF won't happen unless Core supports it.

Validating nodes exert pressure on miners. That's it. It's not a threshold. It's not a count. It's extortion: "signal segwit or we ignore you".

I used to believe that too, hell, up until about a week ago. So I know you aren't an idiot. At a very superficial level, UASF looks a bit like a Sybil attack. Now if you spend any time over at you're going to hear a lot of people claiming that. Because it's a convenient weapon against the idea. And there you go - belief without understanding.
But it's not even close to a Sybil. People use the phrase "economic majority" to describe a UASF because that's entirely accurate. Only nodes that relay a lot of transactions have much of an effect. It's not trivial to fake. Exchanges, wallet provides, and miners will have the largest influence (miners are full nodes as well). That's reason one why it's not a Sybil - because it's distributed consensus, not a botnet.
Not so long ago full nodes and miners were one and the same. Since that task has split apart into two groups, with the advent of purpose-built mining ASICs, some of the job of securing the network went with the miners, and some of it stayed with the nodes. It is the job of nodes to decide on the details of the bitcoin protocol, and to enforce that decision. A UASF is nodes doing what they are supposed to do.
Reason two is that it's got nothing to do with vote counts. There are no vote counts being rigged. UASF is a boycott against miners who aren't signalling for SegWit. I hope you would agree that  boycotts and rigged elections are two very different things.

Alright I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt. I realize I've been a bit too sure of myself and a bit too short with you.

I agree, adoption rates of Classic seem too low. And much of it is new nodes - Classic supporters starting up nodes that didn't exist before.
However, I still disagree with you that classic would represent a "game over" condition. If it succeeds, it is almost certain that core will merge/accept a pull request from Classic and that would be the end of that. No big deal. Just like any other open source project.
@_date: 2016-02-09 20:19:43
Possibly. I've worked with small dev companies, and it's common to add placeholder APIs and string constants when in the early stages of development. If a project is then cancelled or put on the back burner, that stuff can sit there for quite a white before being removed.
I imagine that large companies do this even more so.
It is seldom high priority to remove unused features in code, because compiled languages use an optimizer that removed unused variables, objects, and functions. So simple string constants won't bloat the code at all.

Urgency is precisely what happens when a technology stagnates for years while its competitors implement all of the dev's greatest ideas that bitcoin can't implement thanks to its enormous political and economic baggage. Don't confuse urgency with rushing things through. Nothing about SegWit is rushed.


I guess you mean something different from me when you use the word "ahead". Sure, bitcoin was the first (more or less). It has the first-mover advantage. But that's it. Its competitors are more agile and have implemented features bitcoin will almost certainly never implement, while still being called "bitcoin". It won't take long before some altcoins have stood the test of time, and seen as far less risky than they currently are. One of them is a near exact clone of bitcoin, just going by a different name, and has a much greater chance of implementing SegWit over the next little while. It's not ridiculous to imagine that if this event occurs, there will be an exodus...
Absolutely, stay with bitcoin for now. I am still here as well and I still want it to succeed. But I've got one foot in the escape raft, just in case.

I think they would prefer the solution handed to them rather than have to do any work themselves. Might be why they prefer larger blocks - very minor changes required on their end.

I didn't say it is based on counts. I said it's based on nodes exerting pressure.
In this case, selectively approving only certain types of blocks.
[See here](
When you run a UASF node, you contribute to a devaluation of  the blocks produced by miners who are not signalling segwit.
It's entirely straightforward, it's extortion, and it's the worst idea this community has ever had.
Let me be clear: I am a SegWit supporter. But if the community feels this tactic is justified, I am done with bitcoin entirely, because it has lost its way.
@_date: 2017-04-03 20:52:34
My point is that nodes are not users. You need to run a fully validating node to participate in the UASF. But a single corporation can run multiple nodes, indistinguishable from multiple people each running them. Mining has the same drawback, but the difficulty adjustments ensure that the cost to pull this stunt with the mining network would require the GDP of a small country to pull off. But right now we only have about 6-7k full nodes.
You want to open the flood gates, you be my guest, just give me warning to get the hell out before you guys decide it's OK to extort the mining network. The end result of that will be that bitcoin will be ruled by server racks of RPis running full nodes over proxies, owned by people just as divorced from you and me as mining pool operators.

If you think the engine of hate against SegWit is bad, just wait to see what happens if core ever starts promoting a PoW change. It would be truly a sight to behold. It would effectively kill off an entire industry, if successful. Bitcoin ASIC manufacture... gone. Or at least severely set back. That kind of thing will bring out the worst in people.

I can't recall any other flavor of SegWit being seriously proposed than the one we have now, but my memory is a bit foggy since the scaling debate seemed purely technical to me until recently.

It's still not a Sybil. A chain split, yes, but I'm starting to think that may be inevitable. The ideological divide between SegWit supporters and BU/EC supporters is so vast that I don't see how it can be healed.
Sybil attacks require a single entity that rigs the outcome of a decision, typically involving vote counts. A good example is a botnet that upvotes or downvotes reddit posts.

The mechanism behind the 95% requirement was well planned. The actual choice of number - 95%? I'm not a fan. It permits a single mining pool to veto the whole thing.
Of course SegWit signalling is only at around 30%, so at the moment you can't single out anyone as being the reason it's failing. Still, Jihan is a convenient target given the whole ASICBOOST allegations.
Personal attacks are not a very professional way to handle things, but I can understand the frustration that leads people to vilify folks like Jihan. The language barrier is probably working against him as well, as it leaves more open to the imagination.

It's the high cost of R&amp;D and chip fabrication, expensive equipment and facilities, and wages of highly skilled employees. Even in China, where stuff can be made cheaply by western standards, those costs feel high in the local economy.
In economic lingo, this is called a "barrier to entry". And it helps monopolies emerge because the small fry can barely scrape together enough capital to break into the market.
Once a monopoly exists, new startups - which are financially vulnerable - can literally be priced out of the market. A monopoly can usually afford to operate at a loss in order to kill competition. Whenever you see a price war happen, don't just think "this is great, I can get this for so cheap now!". Think "there goes the competition".

SegWit is almost certain much more controversial than a covert ASICBOOST fix. Because at the end of the day, it's still embroiled in the scaling debate, and even after you cut out hidden motives for working against SegWit, you still have people who genuinely favor different approaches. Whether they've been victims of echo chambers or not doesn't matter, all that matters is what they believe. You want UASF to be as unanimous as possible in order to avoid potential problems.
A patch that only implements a covert ASICBOOST fix should is more neutral. Less likely to encounter resistance from users.

ASICBOOST creates a massive incentive for miners to block a huge array of future changes to bitcoin. The more miners that use it, the larger this incentive becomes.

Hmm, people who compare bitcoin mining to real world mining may not be aware of how vastly different they are.
I actually think that an analogy to salesmen on commission is better. That is, the salesmen who do the most work get paid the most. That's kind of like how bitcoin mining works in the sense that those with the highest hash rate get more blocks.
Then you have difficulty. That would be like if the boss forced all the salesmen to take vacation time if they sold more than a certain value of products per month.
But really, there are no good analogies to bitcoin mining because I don't think anything like it has ever existed.

Have you ever wondered why there are so many Linux distros? The more people you have active in an open source project, the more likely they are to create their own forks which go off in different directions.
The moment bitcoin started attracting so much attention, it became a forgone conclusion that different "distros" of bitcoin would happen.
I suppose there is a small risk that from this, we'll get two (or more) non-compatible blockchains. I consider that unlikely, but it could happen. And you know what? I wouldn't mind. Even that would not be a "sky is falling" situation. None of this should result in us running around in a panic.
If masses of people were going to get rid of their bitcoins because of this situation, they would have already done so. The price has barely changed and we currently have a majority chain *right now*. Yet volume is low. Some people are selling, but not many.
is a poisonous environment that has become an echo chamber for fear and paranoia. As a whole, the bitcoin community is not in the kind of panic that this sub would suggest. You only have to look at the price to see that.

Microtransactions used to be brought up nearly *constantly* back in 2013. Since the value (and risk) of a microtransaction is low, people proposed that zero-conf transactions be used in that case. In that situation you *do not wait* for a confirmation and deliver the product/service immediately. The assumption being that a number of them will end up not going through, but that the losses would be acceptable.
Unfortunately, higher fees prevent even that. Pay them and they could make up a significant portion of the microtransaction. Don't pay them, and the microtransaction may be delayed to such an extent that it is no longer worth the risk to accept them.

That's a nicely nuanced post and I really appreciate it.
Litecoin is doing their UASF a bit better, I think. They already have majority of mining power (actually very close to their activation threshold) signalling for SegWit. Not sure if they're going to put a hash power requirement in the UASF itself, but at this point they hardly seem to need it.
@_date: 2017-04-26 16:59:35
Oh yes, I see. And litecoin did see quite a bit of miner manipulation, with Jihan and allies spinning up entirely brand new ASIC hashing power quite recently. ASICs for litecoin literally just became available on the market and haven't dispersed to many people yet. More centralization.
But Litecoin is also about to adopt SegWit. That could change things, in many ways. For many people sick of bitcoin's apparent stagnation, this will make litecoin look more attractive. It's no longer just a copy of bitcoin, and there are no reasons to think bitcoin will get SegWit any time soon. But the nice thing is that SegWit on LiteCoin (which will lock-in in about 30 minutes from the time of this post) should provide some precedent to help activate in on Bitcoin, too. I hope so. I am invested in both cryptos and don't see it as simple as one "winning" at the cost of the other.
We've seen plenty of miner manipulation of bitcoin as well. And bitcoin, not litecoin, is the one under threat of covert ASICBOOST. And on top of this all, the bitcoin community is fractured in a way that the litecoin community is not.
I see that both bitcoin and litecoin are in this together. Their weaknesses in terms of mining centralization and perverse economic incentives are the same. Just remember, though... no matter how bad the mining scene gets, UASF is always going to be an option.
@_date: 2017-04-22 20:22:00
Scary realization: count the number of the blocks signalling segwit in that image (20), divide by total (21)... that's 95.2%.

That's great in theory, but bitcoin is only secure so long as it is exceedingly difficult to purchase consensus.
Nodes are not trusted because the barriers to spinning them up is very low. That's why miners exist. The moment that nodes have the ability to exert tremendous pressure on miners is the day that bitcoin is entirely, unambiguously dead.
Let me put it this way: UASF with a botnet or two is precisely how BU could force itself on you. Economic majority be damned. Nodes are not an accurate reflection of economic majority.
@_date: 2017-04-15 14:31:20
95%. Just think about that. And SegWit doesn't activate once that threshold is crossed - it has to stay at a 95% average for quite a while. During that period, miners with decent hash rate proportions will be able to game the market by changing their signalling and buying/selling in advance of those changes.
Litecoin's community has near consensus, and a 75% threshold, but is struggling to stay above it. Bitcoin has less consensus and a higher threshold. The 95% threshold enables a *single* mining pool to completely veto SegWit.
SegWit's current activation scheme will fail, so let's hope there's a plan B that actually has a chance. Knowing full well that core is against the current UASF plan, who knows what plan B could possibly be. Core is tight lipped about it, too. I take that to mean they don't have a plan B.
@_date: 2017-04-14 21:34:37
I can understand that, it seemed like from the BIP that it required individual changes to deal with each little detail.

You can't split without becoming an altcoin. That's just the way it is. A diverging blockchain, incompatible nodes, different protocols. We'd have to see it for what it is - something entirely new. 
The splitters don't want to be an altcoin, though. They want to continue to use the existing bitcoin network for as long as possible, and they even want bitcoin core to rebrand itself so that the situation seems like a Y-shaped fork in the road, with neither of the chains perceived as more original than the other.
Big blockers would be better off, IMO, letting go of bitcoin core and going their own way. They can call themselves whatever they like, but trying to use mining power to split the existing network without regard to how the rest of the community feels is very hostile. Ver could have already had his fully operational bitcoin unlimited with big blocks or emergent consensus or whatever they're calling it these days had he not tried to poach clients from the existing bitcoin network.
So, I agree. A split may be necessary. But anyone who splits needs to do so honestly. You don't leave a company, found a new one, give it a confusingly similar name, and try to poach your old company's clients. It's just not good form.

The only way either of us are going to see the truth is by waiting and seeing what happens. If the UASF is ultimately not needed because miners pull some unexpected moves, then great - you and I can celebrate and forget this nasty business.
But if UASF ends up being the weapon of choice, I suggest you carefully watch things. Literally everything about the UASF screams Sybil to me, and for some bizarre reason people on this sub seem to think that Sybil attacks only occur when there are votes. It's not just that. It's about gaining disproportionate "influence", which *may* be vote counts, but may also be other things - like the ability to indirectly alter vote counts by punishing miners who don't vote your way. Adding a layer of abstraction doesn't make it a less scummy approach.
I will admit, there are plenty of things about bitcoin I don't know. I've sought out articles explaining how UASF works and it all seems pretty clear to me, the articles are easy to understand and seem to paint a pretty clear picture. But Sybil attacks are never mentioned. Not even any attempt to explain why it's not a concern. So you can understand why I'm kind of incredulous over it becoming a fan favorite, apparently no questions asked.

Yup. Bitmain has produced the Antminer L3+, sold it to a bunch of people, delayed delivery, and is rumored to now be using them themselves. The rumors are somewhat substantiated, since insider sources say he's got something like 1000 of them running, and his hash rate went way up very suddenly.
The reason for delayed shipping is supposedly a firmware problem. If so, it's funny how he's got all these L3+ miners mining litecoin for him while being simultaneously unable to delivery any of said units to paying customers due to technical issues. Riiiight.

More hash power is not only what bitcoin needs.
Bitcoin needs highly distributed hash power. Sure, the more of it the better, but only if it's highly distributed. Trading hash power for more evenly distributed hash power may be well worth it.

Paypal has never been particularly proactive or clear about its policies. What they do is make vague policies that can be interpreted in many ways. Then, if they don't like something, they shut it down, citing their vague policies.
If something like Hola unblocker were a paid service, for example, Paypal would likely ban them. Because they are intended to be used for circumventing locality-based restrictions.

That doesn't make shapeshift irrelevant. Firstly, a lot of cryptos are going to fundamentally incompatible with SegWit or just not bother with it at all. Litecoin is a noteworthy exception - it's a fork of bitcoin. That's why so many people talking about atomic swaps like to talk about bitcoin &lt;-&gt; litecoin.
ShapeShift's value is that it functions as an overly simplified exchange. It automatically tracks market price and serves a matchmaking role for the transaction. The desire for those two things by a lot of people are the only reason ShapeShift exists. It's not necessary, it's just convenience.
Now maybe, if SegWit is expanded on further, and wallet software has built-in currency pair trading, then he might be in trouble. But as a businessman in a fledgling industry with, no doubt, a sizable holdings of bitcoin, he has a financial interest in preventing those holdings from becoming worthless. I don't think his financial interests are so different from those of anyone else in bitcoin.

Maybe in the future, but not right now.
Check out People have tried and failed, over and over, to predict price based on fundamentals. The only thing that seems to predict the price is speculation. People buy when they think the price has hit a bottom. They then try to predict the top. At some point critical mass occurs and the people predicting the top and selling off actually cause the price to drop noticeably. That snowballs. Then eventually the same happens with people trying to predict the bottom. Rinse and repeat.
Prevailing sentiment also comes in play. If bitcoin has been under a lot of criticism, people are more inclined to sell, less inclined to buy. If lots of very positive developments occur, that can have the opposite effect.
For the last two years, developments have been fairly "meh". A mix of good news, criticism, and uncertainty. As a result, the price has fluctuated around, but nowhere near as much as bitcoin is known for.
We might see the influence of fundamentals when the halving occurs.
We might also see the influence of positive sentiment if major scaling concerns begin to get addressed.

I got a pretty good laugh at your summary of the legalese, I have to say. And that's essentially what it boils down to. Copyright stuff.
Think of this from Paypal's point of view. They are a business and collect pretty hefty fees from transactions. It hurts them to shut down large numbers of customers.
They are doing this because someone is putting pressure on them. That someone would probably be big studios and copyright holders with expensive lawyers. Once they receive a complaint from somebody with enough clout, that's when Paypal actually (and probably for the first time) looks at your website to see if you're violating anything in their TOS.
As I said, Paypal has a long history of vague policies that appear on paper to be much more far-reaching than they are actually meant for. That's why the article says that while Paypal *technically* can cut off all VPN business, they probably won't. They have a history of this sort of tactic. I suspect that if they receive a complaint from a studio, they'd rather just make the problem go away quickly and effortlessly. So if they make their policies vague enough, they can do that.

What we have here, with a single miner able to veto SegWit activation in two separate cryptocurrencies by virtue of having a near monopoly over ASIC manufacture (and "testing" their hardware instead of delivering it as promised) is, I'm pretty sure, not the way Bitcoin (or litecoin) was intended to work.

B) I don't know... I'm leery of giving miners any more influence over the network given the centralization that exists. In a highly distributed mining network, no problem. In the one we have today? No.

Is this a joke? I used to get enough confirmations to make the exchanges happy (6?) in 20-30 minutes with a transaction fee of pennies. Not only has the fee gone up in terms of how many Satoshi it costs, but also in the corresponding dollar value of those Satoshi. Used to cost a fraction of a penny, and paying pennies would get you priority service. Back then, people were very excited about microtransactions because the fees were low enough to permit it.
We can disagree on *how* to address scaling, but there's not much room left for disagreeing on its necessity. The number of transactions per day on bitcoin [keeps increasing]( Fees and delays will also continue to increase. It's going to get worse. There's a real risk that bitcoin will lose its dominance in the crypto scene before anything resembling consensus comes along.

Well, he did foresee some degree of centralization of network nodes:
"At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware."
Bitcoin Core chose a 95% activation threshold as a *highly* conservative threshold to all but rule out the risk of a persistent chain split or other potentially nasty consequences. Their risk aversion had the side effect of allowing a single mining pool to veto the entire thing.
Litecoin went with 75%. I feel that's a better target. It still requires agreement between numerous miners/pools, but makes it less likely that a single one can veto the whole shebang.
In the future I feel that these targets should be set intentionally to avoid giving veto power to individual mining pools or collusion between a small number of them. And if that means the threshold gets too low for comfort, then it's a signal that you can't actually trust the mining network to make that particular decision and need to go with a UASF. It carries risk too, but doing nothing is also a risk in itself.

Each of the proposed solutions has its own merits. However, there are different levels of risk depending on whether the solution requires a "soft fork" or a "hark fork". Without getting into the details, a "soft fork" avoids changing as many underlying protocol requirements as possible, or at least provides logic that makes older style transactions compatible with the new way of doing things. "Hard forks" change the protocol in a way that makes older style transactions incompatible. They are more risky because people who fail to upgrade may find their transactions accepted only by a legacy blockchain. This is called a chain split. Such a situation is actually nearly guaranteed but is likely to resolve itself very quickly.
Although this generally makes soft forks preferred if possible, some see them as being unnecessarily complicated, because soft forks tend to require additional new code to get around the fact that you are limited in the changes you can make to existing code. SegWit is a soft fork solution as currently proposed, but some people want it implimented in a hark fork along with a non-witness block size increase (sorry for the jargon there).
The pro-BU crowd has rejected SegWit as a soft fork partly because of this reason, although politics and ideology have taken center stage. The core devs are just that - devs, and some are clearly not particularly skilled at public relations. They've upset some people who now appear to be boycotting basically everything they produce. Although I am aware this generalization likely doesn't apply to everyone who is against SegWit. But I've yet to see a well thought out technical argument against it that isn't wrapped up in ideology and conspiracy theory.
My opinion is that SegWit is the preferred option at this time, and I hope that core will consider being more transparent and diplomatic in the future, so that we can better avoid the sorts of in-fighting that has resulted in part from their behavior.

A UASF would run counter to how bitcoin's consensus system is supposed to work. The entire idea of having miners in the first place, and proof of work with matching difficulty, is to set up a governance system that is hard (very costly) to manipulate/buy consensus on. A UASF introduces a bad precedent of circumventing this when it becomes convenient to do so. If it happens, it will be a very controversial decision the likes of Ethereum's DAO hard-fork patch. You can expect fallout.
If you can't get SegWit via majority of miners (and I'd settle with 75%+... 95%+ is impossible), then it probably won't happen without violating principles on which bitcoin was founded. Some people would say this has become necessary due to the disconnect between miners and users. Maybe.

Is the UASF functionality of BIP8 different than BIP148? You can almost certainly ignore the astronomically low possibility of an early activation by miners so you'll still be relying on a UASF. Not unless something VERY interesting happens in the near future...
The last time UASF was seriously mentioned, even some folks in favor of core+SegWit spoke out against it. A UASF would incite an even stronger civil war, so you don't want to deploy it unless you know you're going to win.

An average of 10 minutes is only true when hash rate is fixed. As miners increase hash rate during a difficulty period, the time between blocks can be much lower. If bitcoin is experiencing a period of rapid hash rate growth, which has commonly occurred in the past, block time is much less than 10 minutes.
Adding to this, back in 2014, you almost always got into the current/next block because the mempool was rarely full and empty blocks were less common. These days you're lucky to get into the current/next block during week days unless you pay a higher than normal fee.
But I see what you mean. I don't know how many confirmations the exchanges require(d), which is why I was clear that I was guessing in the post you replied to. I definitely remember it being fairly quick to move bitcoins onto and off btc-e back in the day. Just enough time to laugh at the people in the trollbox.

SegWit has too much political and economic baggage. If it's bundle with a covert ASICBOOST solution (or offered as the solution, because it is one) it'll encounter more resistance than a much more neutral fix.

For certain use cases, absolutely. Traders (who keep their coins in hot wallets and don't even use the blockchain much of the time) and holders and people doing international remittance will be fine. For now.
Keep marginalizing those use cases and soon all you have left are the traders and holders. So, just digital gold after all, which is not what many people hoped bitcoin would be. It was supposed to revolutionize financial services. It can't if it's just digital gold.

I've heard talk of a PoW change, but wouldn't that be sort of an extreme measure that could render billions of dollars in ASICs entirely worthless? I mean, if you want to alienate *all* miners, that's how you'd do it. So what's the idea behind it?
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:09:30
And what are you in it for? You think bitcoin can save the world, and nothing else can?
A lot of these cryptos can do the same job. Hell, litecoin is a literal copy of bitcoin's code with relatively minor changes (the most fundamental being the use of a mining algorithm that attempts to reduce the allure of ASICs).
If you want to make a difference you need to recognize when the ship is sinking. I am not convinced bitcoin is a sinking ship... yet. But it's damn well close. All this infighting *WILL* kill it if allowed to continue, just as infighting has killed open source projects in the past. It is the spinoff projects and forks that tend to survive such events, up to and including movement of lead developers from one project to another.
That's when you'll know that bitcoin is basically dead. Watch the bitcoin core team members. When they start resigning, switching over to other cryptos, etc... that'll be the cue to get the hell out. And fast.

We now know/strongly suspect that the asicboost strategy has been used in secret by Bitmain. They had to be covert about it because they either didn't want their competitors to know it was possible with their hardware or didn't want to get in trouble for violating a patent (or both).
We, it just so happens that SegWit was designed to be compatible with a limited number of mining methods. **Covertly** using asicboost was not one of them. And the reason that should make us all go "whoa" is that it sets up an economic incentive for Bitmain to push back against SegWit. Which is precisely what they've been doing.
I'm still waiting to see how this plays out - how Bitmain responds, if independent people can verify Greg's findings, etc. But so far, it really does come together nicely. There's reason to believe that Bitmain were opposing SegWit purely to keep their monopoly over asicboost.
Now that everybody knows about it, you can expect the playing field to be leveled one way or the other - either everybody just starts doing it, or bitcoin gets patched to prevent it.
@_date: 2017-04-10 12:07:37
Keep in mind that running nodes at home is a very small part of this battle.
A UASF requires exchanges, wallet providers, and even miners get in on the action. "Economic consensus" means that if your node is not well configured, on a fast connection, doing a shit-ton of work, then it's not making much of a difference. Node counts are fairly meaningless in a UASF - it's more about how much economic influence your node has.
Contact your exchanges, wallet providers, and mining pools. Ask them to support SegWit and the UASF. I guess it's like calling your senators, in a way. They represent us, and once in a blue moon they actually listen.

Moore's law has been a self-fulfilling prophecy, and using industry data to "prove" it was a sketchy thing to do in the first place. The industry set Moore's law as a target, and worked very hard to keep up with it. So people have been using "fudged" data to prove a hypothesis that was being used to generate the "fudged" data.
It has become difficult to keep up. The problem is waste heat. 3d/layered/stacked chips aren't a solution because they actually make the heat problem worse. But there are different ways of measuring Moore's law... do you just count transistors (the purist way)? Or do you look at the speed of the device? If you just count transistors, Moore's law is still on track. We still haven't hit the limit of transistor size, but it's getting there. We're approaching a point of diminishing returns where smaller transistors will cause more and more errors that will require more error correction, thus slowing down operation and generating even more waste heat.

When I first got involved in bitcoin in 2013, there were 2 main use cases proposed as to why bitcoin would be helpful to the general population:
1) Microtransactions
2) Lower fees than other payment methods
Both of those are now in great danger of vanishing if a fee market emerges. Hardcore supporters will say "so what, bitcoin doesn't need mass adoption". Okay, but is it ever a good thing to just decide that certain use cases are pointless before they even get a chance to truly emerge?
@_date: 2017-04-06 17:43:30
I agree. But I prefer to directly attack BU as a concept, rather than insulting its supporters. I've believed in dumb things many times. I can't fault them for doing it too.

You realize your source has vested interests in fighting against the perception of the death of Moore's law? That guy makes his money by selling books where "Moore's law forever" is a single overarching assumption.
If he comes up with a working solution that allows us to make transistors the size of atoms that *still work*, I'll listen. Until then, he's only saying what he needs to say to make the rest of his statements look credible.
The reason the death of Moore's law is so constantly predicted is because we are basically driving right towards a brick wall at high speed. We can see the wall coming even though we haven't hit it yet. It will take a completely new type of technology to drive around that wall, and there's no telling what it may be or how long it will take to hit the market.

If bitcoin core eventually succeeds in getting SegWit activated, but at the cost of a chain split, it would be strange to describe bitcoin core + SegWit as a "side chain that became the main chain".
I don't think describing ETH that way makes much sense, personally. But I can see it both ways. Ultimately, "side" or "main" is a subjective decision based on how you define those words.

Hello Wang Chun.
Can you explain why you think SegWit would be a disaster? is encouraging us to talk, so let's talk.
I can't promise I'll understand the technical details, but others will be able to. In return, I hope you will consider the replies you get (although you'd be right to ignore the ones that resort to personal attacks, of which I'm sure there will be many).
I may be completely wrong in supporting SegWit. I would like you to admit that you may be wrong in opposing it. If both sides of the debate can do that, then the technical arguments either way can hopefully stand on their own.
@_date: 2017-04-06 15:31:28
That's true. Although if the accusations are true, and their incentive for rallying against SegWit was to keep their use of asicboost a secret, then at least some of their financial incentive to do a 51% attack is kind of over now that people know what they're up to. But how can they do a 51% attack anyway? They don't have that much of the hashing power, do they? Unless people are suggesting they're going to remotely control the mining hardware that they've sold to other miners.

A UASF *should* be attacked. Hear me out before you downvote, assuming I'm just a shill from Core is right to require some sort of mining consensus. I think 95%+ is too high, but it aught to represent some sort of supermajority.
We're all so quick to call BU out on suggesting a 51% attack... but a UASF is no better. Nodes are cheap as peanuts and easy to run on botnets. It makes it so much easier to buy consensus. That is not the type of precedent you want to set.
Bitcoin's reliance on miners to secure the network by regulating consensus is the backbone of much of its security. I am quite surprised that the core dev team has yet to issue a joint statement explaining this. But I do expect it to happen if a UASF ever looks likely.

This is still early development days of bitcoin. Mass adoption has not happened. Now is perhaps the last chance to do any further improvements.
SegWit is a security and efficiency patch that permits safe development of many types of 3rd party services, and improves bitcoin's ability to handle higher transaction throughput. This is not the kind of thing you stall.
You're asking a fledgling cryptocurrency to just stop everything because some investors bought into it early and got unexpectedly rich to the point where their new lifestyles depend on keeping things the same.
You're right to want resistance to change, but you set the bar so high that by the time SegWit meets your standards, bitcoin will have faded into irrelevance.

Eh? The "users" have to signal *with a node*. Your wallet software is a node. Just not (usually) a full node.
And there's nothing stopping those "users" from being server racks full of Raspberry Pis.
UASF works by *nodes* rejecting blocks from miners that don't signal in the manner specific.
@_date: 2016-02-10 19:40:28
I still haven't seen any evidence that it's actually going to happen, though.
It would be nice, but I am still skeptical.
@_date: 2017-04-03 21:01:57
Fully validating nodes (full nodes) running the UASF ignore blocks from miners that aren't signalling segwit. That's the basic premise. Do we agree up to this point?
The more nodes do that, the harder the miners are hit. It's not a count in the sense that the number of nodes running the UASF somehow triggers a thresdhold. Instead, as nodes add up, more and more economic pressure is applied to the miners. Non-segwit blocks are relayed more and more slowly. The miners get fewer and fewer of the block rewards because the segwit blocks beat them to the finish line.
Now it's then up to the miners if they take the hit, or they cave in and switch to signalling segwit. Again, it's extortion.
That's why I mention RPis. It's not about counts directly. There's no code in there that says that after 51% of the nodes are running the UASF, miners are somehow forced to switch. It's just a gradually inreasing pressure you put on them. The more little boxes you get running UASF, the more pressure.
It's a good time to control a few botnets.

A patch to prevent covert ASICBOOST should now be priority. Higher priority than SegWit, or anything else for that matter. And for obvious reasons it must not be miner activated.
There is no way to know if it's being used or if that's what the miners are implying on the chat log. But things do really seem to add up, don't they?
It's practically a security patch, because covert ASICBOOST greatly encourages mining centralization.

Bitcoin will never get that that degree of privacy, because it would require being rebuilt from the ground up. That's not a feature you can implement as an added layer. It will have to be an altcoin, built with that goal from day 0.
Bitcoin can certainly be more "instant", however. But LTC will get there first, it seems. Although Jihan is sure trying to prevent it. His business now has a stake in Litecoin as he's started manufacturing LTC mining hardware. Of course it appears that instead of shipping them as promised, he's "testing" them, haha. What a guy.

It's impossible to know the difficulty in advance. At best you can make an educated guess, maybe something based on Moore's law, but it will still just be a guess. That's why the difficulty is set by actually measuring the network's hash rate over time. That single measure makes the system future proof. The bitcoin proof of work technique was an easy way to implement a computational challenge whose difficulty could be arbitrarily scaled. But it's not the only way.
For example, if you did protein folding instead, you could increase difficulty purely by requiring that miners fold more proteins, or fold more complex ones.
What all of this does not protect against is the possibility that someone with billions to spare will build an extremely powerful computer to initiate a 51+% attack with the goal of disrupting bitcoin. That could technically be done at the level of government agencies if they really wanted to, but it would be expensive even for them, because they have to fight against the combined hashing power of the rest of the world.
If bitcoin ever goes mainstream I can anticipate that governments will start running very powerful mining farms specifically to prevent other countries from disrupting the system. And also, perhaps, to give them some interesting real-time data on the financial network...
Any computational problem should be reasonably well suited to being used as a difficulty barrier. All you need for success is competition among miners.

[Core held up their end of the bargain as far as they could]( It's not a withdrawn BIP or anything. And I do believe Luke Jr actually whipped up the code for it. Greg posted a comment about this not so long ago saying something to that effect. The BIP is still there. Now it's up to the other parties to first activate SegWit. Oh wait...
In fact, there are [many BIPs - look at the 10x numbered BIPs]( for increasing block size. Take your pick. Hell, even a [miner consensus mechanism]( is there! Gee, I wonder where BU got its idea from?
But the HK agreement has been violated so far, by (some of) the miners. Not a whole lot of motivation to make good on your promises when the people you made those promises to keep trying to screw you over.
But what happened between the HK agreement and now that make so many of these miners change their minds about supporting SegWit? That's the big question, and one possible answer is that when the technical details of SegWit became clear, the miners realised it would have a serious and very costly implication... it would put and end to their covert use of asicboost. It's just an allegation, with only (very compelling) circumstantial evidence. But it explains so much...

This is not a problem bitcoin can solve. This is not an economic problem. It's an educational problem - most people have all the brainpower they need to think critically and fact-check the BS they are fed by the media, but haven't been taught the skills they need to do so, what Carl calls the "baloney detection kit".
Reading that book is probably the best thing I did for myself. It led me into a scientific career and changed how I look at the world. It filled in gaps in my education (critical thinking skills) that 22 years of high school and post-secondary education failed to provide. Thankfully Carl Sagan did the job for them.

I can totally see it your way... but also Greg's. A firewall is a very real disconnect, it's literally severing the communication.

If I then add a single entry, say for my personal website... am I then connected to the internet? I would say "no". The Internet is a package deal.
Now, I would bet that big miners only connect their mining hardware to a computer running a full node. So all the miners themselves see is a LAN. They communicate with the full node, it communicates with the rest of the bitcoin network.

Of course there's a whole other level of misdirection to Bitmain's response because it completely ignores the reason why covert ASICBOOST is a problem. And that's the fact that it's covert, and relies on resisting changes to bitcoin to keep it that way. That won't change even if everybody does it.

The upgrade is to fix exploitable transaction malleability.
The scaling and fix to covert ASICBOOST are *both* secondary to that.
A large part of why there is opposition to SegWit is because supporters keep trying to sell it as a scaling solution. Everyone has their own opinion on how to scale, so if you market your upgrade as being part of that debate, your upgrade becomes controversial.
There hasn't been this controversy for Litecoin. Charlie Lee "sold" SegWit as a security solution, and only a security solution, because Litecoin is not experiencing a capacity problem. Now they've got 80% of hash power supporting SegWit.

I would like you remind you of the *three years* of price stagnation that many of us went through before this shit went vertical in 2017.
The point is, look at bitcoin from a technical point of view. Forget the price for the moment. Do you believe it has value as a technology? If yes, don't sell a thing and wait years. If no, sell everything and never look back. That's informed gambling, at least, as opposed to gambling on nothing but gut feelings.

It's hard to exactly know what they mean by "crypto-friendly banking", but it would be weird to think that it will only be used for personal accounts. Corporate accounts will likely be opened there. And it comes with a debit card which essentially acts as a merchant service, although the merchant doesn't need to care about the technical details. They just see it as another bank card that dispenses local currency. This kind of service wouldn't be necessary if merchants accepted bitcoin directly, so why don't they? I suspect it has more to do with volatility than any other consideration. Steam's recent explanation of why they stopped accepting bitcoin seems to confirm that, although the issue of potentially long confirmation times is involved as well.
This centralization is about trust. As long as you deal with fiat, you have to trust someone - the exchange can't be made atomic. Many people are more willing to trust a corporation with years of history than an individual they just met on localbitcoins.
Until the day that bitcoin is stable enough to have a predictable value over months or years, all of this will continue being necessary due to exchanges to and from fiat.

Linus tech tips or Linus Torvalds? No matter, they can probably only offer anecdotal evidence. It's very hard to prove anything even using rigorous scientific methods, and if a widespread heat stress problem existed in NVIDIA chips, you'd have to be wealthy (you need a good sample size) and prepare your butt for lawsuits (from NVIDIA) to get anywhere close to proof.
I could equally "prove" the opposite with my experience - 2 of 3 NVIDIA cards I've had eventually failed, and all the symptoms pointed to wire bonding failure - they could be temporarily "resurrected" by overheating, but at best it was a temporary fix. But again... it's just anecdote. 
My old Radeon 9800 PRO failed, too. Same cause as far as I could tell at the time, but that was many years ago. So I wouldn't say this is an NVIDIA issue. It's a physics issue. Same reason your car engine doesn't last forever. Wear and tear.

Some business isn't enough for a hard fork. We need basically all of them, and not just businesses, but users as well.
Another block size increase from core would almost certainly be superior to anything we've seen from any other camp so far in terms of safety. And with a suitably strict activation requirement, we can be reasonably certain that the activation would at least have broad miner consensus, and enough nodes to support the resulting network.
Worse things could happen. But bitcoin core are very picky about what they do and do not release. They err on the side of releasing nothing at all. And I think that's the right strategy for a system that requires insane levels of care and security.

For your statement to be correct, miners must be aware that all miners are using it. Otherwise, if they think they're the only ones to use it, or one of a few, they will fight to keep it that way and fight to keep the knowledge of their use of it a secret. Covert ASICBOOST makes it impossible for miners to be aware of whether their competition is using it. But they'll be very much aware of the impact that losing it would have on their bottom line. Even if they knew that everybody was using it, they'd still be crazy turn agree to turn it off and negatively affect their net profits while the difficulty adjusts to account for the new situation.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:03:47
Some sort of controlled distribution is the best they can get, and miners will just find ways around it, so there's little point. It's literally impossible to make the hardware itself recognize and disable GPU mining.
The solution to having too much demand is to realize it's not a problem. Your product is selling as fast as you can make it and you're swimming in cash. Maybe use some of that cash to build more chip fabs, but that's totally optional to be honest. NVIDIA doesn't have a problem, it's a seller's market. It's we who have the problem :(
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:29:06


One other way is transaction fees.
Another way is volunteerism. A lot of people are running nodes and getting jack all in exchange. While nobody is going to set up a million-dollar mining farm out of the goodness of their heart, a lot of people would be willing to use some of their home CPU/GPU cycles here and there.
Since we're talking about a *MASS* adoption scenario, you can multiply a paltry effort by a shit ton of people to achieve a fairly robust network. Highly distributed volunteerism might even be more secure than our current situation.

Technically, it's not folding, it's "pivoting". It would perhaps be better in the long term if they actually were folding. I used to like them a lot, they've done much for bitcoin adoption, but their partnership with Jihan and insistence on forcing their adoptees onto a fork of bitcoin makes me lose a lot of faith in them. I think they can definitely still salvage their reputation, but they'd have to cut ties with Jihan and only adopt 2x if their customers demand it, and only then as an option.

Just apply SI prefixes/suffixes to either Satoshis or Bitcoins, or come up with names for various power-of-ten multiples. Same thing we do with all other currencies. A lot of places already use mBTC. It's not super common, but it's common enough to catch on if buying cheap stuff with bitcoin becomes popular.
In terms of your problem of not knowing what it's worth when things are priced in bitcoin, that's more to do with bitcoin's volatility than anything else. Hard to know what a bitcoin is worth when it's worth something different every day.

Nobody knows. Even though we expect the adoption rate to be shaped a certain way, extrapolation is always error-prone and the sigmoid shape is just a generalization.
The rate will depend on what exchanges and wallets do to support SegWit. If the major exchanges and wallets switch to using it for most transactions, especially if it's a default setting, adoption would rapidly increase. When they do this will determine when we go into the nearly vertical part of the sigmoid curve. Could be a few weeks from now, could be months or years.

There are lots of reasons to think he's not Satoshi:
- His public "proof" was an outright forgery, complete with spoofed dates on blog posts and finally deleting everything once people called him on his BS.
- It is possible to fake the private proofs he provided Gavin by serving up altered version of the software they used to validate the signed message (see below for technical details on how to do so). Because they were private proofs, they cannot be scrutinized independently. He also prevented Gavin and that reporter from taking photos, written notes of the technical details of the signed message. Suspicious.
- His talks are incoherent technobabble laced with profanity and personal attacks against his opponents. This is not how the Satoshi we know behaves, and suggests that CW doesn't understand the tech well enough to explain it properly.
- And at the end of the day, the burden of proof lies with the person making the claim. We are making counterclaims, saying that he did not even come close to providing this proof. We do not have to prove anything; CW does. He has not only failed, but provided forged evidence and behavior consistent with a con artist.
Gavin never saw the private keys. He saw a message purportedly signed with them, and then checked the validity of the signed message against a public key using software that was quite possibly rigged to report any message as valid so long as it contained the initials "CSW", which Craig Wright insisted on adding. Give anyone with some coding skills the source code to the legit software, and all it will take is 2 or 3 more lines to add a loophole to the validation check. Then they just need a wireless access point/router that can overpower the hotel wifi, which is not hard to do if it's nearby. Have the AP set the computer as the DNS server, and have it serve up a spoofed website with the altered software, but pass through everything else. It's not "easy", but it's not hard either.
A public proof is absolutely required that can be verified entirely independently. It's also insanely easy to provide such a public proof, doesn't put his coins at risk, and doesn't put his privacy at risk either given that he's already made the claim in the first place. So why hasn't he done this? The only reason I can think of is that he can't, because he's not Satoshi.

Playing devil's advocate here, Bcash is inferior to 2x. It's based on an old version of bitcoin core lacking in recent bug/exploit fixes, and it's developed by an exclusive and secretive group of people who discourage community participation, barely communicate with us, and so on. They may be open source, but they are not open.
The NYA specified that SegWit had to be included. And I bet you a lot of the signatories actually want SegWit. Remember, they are businesses first and foremost - do you think they liked the idea of 3rd party transaction malleability? SegWit fixes that, BCash does not. If I had to pick between them for some reason (as opposed to sticking with core), I'd pick 2x.

And, I can understand your side. You want larger blocks so that adoption can grow on-chain. Fine.
You already have that, but it doesn't go by the name of "bitcoin".
That's why I'm hostile to you. Not because I don't understand what you want, but because you just DON'T have the consensus needed to push this change on everyone without getting a lot of disagreement.
If there was consensus, we wouldn't be arguing here. Your job is to obtain consensus FIRST, then, and only then, prepare for the hard fork.

His motives are probably just pure greed, not actually anti-bitcoin.
Still, we have reasons to be concerned about Bitmain:
- Establishing a HUGE monopoly over mining hardware. I mean, Bitmain is good at what they do. So while this point is a concern, it's also pretty impressive.
- Establishing a large proportion of the mining hash power. If rumors are to be believed and Bitmain owns many mining pools that they claim not to own (eg, ViaBTC), then they actually have &gt; 50%, which is a potential security concern.
- Throwing their weight behind two hard forks, neither of which had (IMO) adequate consensus. The Bitcoin Cash hard fork doesn't seem to have caused noticeable disruption, mind you.
- Possibly lying about using patented covert Asicboost technology. The means are there, so they'd actually be stupid not to, yet they claim they do not use it for the good of bitcoin. This is entirely rumor except for the part about the means being there. We have no way of knowing if they are actually using it.
- Patenting mining techniques and using said patents to sue their competitors. We know they are doing this one for sure.
The pattern is pretty consistent: they just want to be THE mining corporation, to hell with decentralization. It's the mindset of pretty much every corporation ever: dominate the market and make shit-tons of money. The problem is, that mindset has started to clash with the goals of bitcoin. IMO they should do what GHash.io did and vow to cap their hash rate to a reasonably low proportion of the total, and do what they can to relieve concerns about the other points above.

Listening nodes participate fully in the p2p network and enforce rules not just for you, but for other nodes which connect to you. Non-listening nodes do not do these things (as much). I imagine the peers that a non-listening node connect to become aware of it and can then do a two-way exchange of data, but by forwarding that port you make it a lot easier for nodes to discover you. It's very much worth doing if your goal when running a full node is to contribute to the network.

Honestly, it's probably FAR less costly to an exchange to temporarily lose customers who decide to withdraw before the fork to get their S2X coins. Paying for dev time, testing time, and customer support is expensive as hell. Having that ready in time for the fork is especially difficult since the S2X code isn't even finished yet.
Opt-in replay protection does not currently exist, and the previous incarnation which was removed [was shit]( even before someone pointed out that it's also vulnerable to attack. Don't expect much from S2X when it comes to replay protection. Even if they add something at the last minute, who the hell would trust that? It will be entirely up to the exchanges to ensure their customers funds are safe, and if I were in the biz, I'd rather lose a few customers than deal with that mess.

They'd have difficulty doing that, too, though. The BCash folks absolutely hate SegWit, that's why they created BCash even after SegWit2x was fleshed out. They aren't going to respond kindly to an attempted SegWit activation on BCash and it's hard to see how it would ever happen. 
Plus, BCash has failed to attract the kind of adoption that SegWit2x is aiming for. Yeah, they want the bitcoin name, absolutely. They know that many bitcoiners have a lot of apathy here and will just keep using the same thing they've always been using. Finding a way to convert bitcoin core to segwit2x, having users of lite wallets, web wallets, etc automatically moved over without them even knowing it happened - that's what they want.

Yup. And the sliding difficulty system makes the entire system self-adjusting to suit the situation.
As long as the cost to obtain 51%+ of bitcoin's hash power is suitably prohibitive, we're good. I do not subscribe to the concept that bitcoin's lack of inflation will somehow put an end to mining. The incentives will change, the people doing the mining will change, and the hardware used will change. And none of that matters as long as we still have a suitably high hash rate.

It's the transistor size. The smaller you can make them, the more you can fit in the same space. Interestingly, Moore's law is not actually about processor speed, but about transistor size - in general, the number of transistors you can fit into a given area doubles every 18 months. In recent years this has not led to doubling of processing speed directly, but increasing parallelization (which benefits some tasks, but not others).

Doesn't matter how many companies sell ASICs. If one has a massively overwhelming market share, it's a monopoly even if there are 1000 other manufacturers.
Monopolies naturally form - it is just how economies work. Luckily, what is more important for bitcoin is not who makes the ASICs, and whether they have a monopoly over their production, but whether any of those folks have a hash rate majority, and how they use their influence over the community.

I'm not suggesting we fork/don't fork bitcoin on the opinions of 1000 people. But we can't just ignore said opinions because they are contrary to what we wanted them to say.
You're right, bitcoin is not a democracy. However, the fork we're discussing doesn't exist yet. The decision about whether to support it, to start mining it, to run nodes for it in the first moments of its existence can not be based on any objective metric, because such things will not exist until some time later. What this means is that right now, we're fighting a war of opinions. Hash rate doesn't matter now because hash rate hasn't even entered into the equation yet. And when it does, it will follow the market. The miners will mine the chain that gives them the most return.
Don't ignore "the long tail". The sum of a lot of small economic actors can overwhelm all the rest.

I was going to say, if a nation experiences "bitcoinization", we'd know, because we wouldn't be sitting here with an empty mempool.
We should probably move on that lightning network idea in more earnest, so that the network is ready for such an event. But that needs a lot more than the proof of concept tests we've seen so far. It needs near universal support in all major wallets with highly polished, easy to use interfaces.

Those are not the only undesirable effects, it also greatly increases network resource usage for full nodes.
That all being said, technology marches along, and the 1 MB block size limit has been in place for long enough that it is now an artificial constraint. There are two ways to respond to that. The first, core's position, is that this is good because it keeps the network requirements and blockchain size somewhat reasonable for low-end hardware, making the network more robust to failure. The other point of view is that if 1 MB was an acceptable block since in 2010, then surely a larger block size would be equally acceptable 7 years later.
I can see the merits of both arguments. However, in the current climate where Bitmain has continued to accumulate influence over the network on numerous fronts, I lean towards wanting to ensure that full nodes remain compatible with low end hardware, to hopefully prevent the emergence of centralization there as well.
But the debate is truly over in the sense that it's become pointless - competing networks representing both sides are now available. Debate is no longer necessary. Just buy into what you believe in and leave the other side in peace.

I disagree. A fee market only emerges once blocks are already full. Up to that point, spam attacks are very cheap, dependant only on a minimum fee set by miners and/or nodes. We know this because there was a time not so long ago that bitcoin transaction fees were *optional*. And if you have some old bitcoins laying around, you can override minimum fee requirements by spending old coins, because the age of the inputs also factors into the transaction priority (although core wishes to remove this feature, which I'd say might be a good idea).

Having your own server is either
1) Useless if you don't allow both outgoing and incoming mail
2) A major security risk for the average person if you do
Gmail is quite secure if you use the proper 2FA. To reach the same level of security with your own e-mail server would require a level of technical understanding that most people lack. They are more likely to figure out 2FA.
But I wonder if you mean the same thing I do when you say "e-mail server". I mean, I have a domain name and hosting account that gives me an custom e-mail domain name but I'd never in a million years consider that having my own e-mail server.

The best person to fix this problem is Satoshi himself/herself/themselves. This would require a cryptographically proven (signed with private key), unique and timestamped message "I am not Craig Wright, Sept 25 2017" or something like that.
But Satoshi is perhaps deceased, and perhaps Craig Wright knows this - and is taking advantage of it.
It is also possible that Satoshi has reason to be paranoid about using his private key even for something as simple as signing a message.
In any case, the next best thing is just to call Craig Wright out on his complete inability to prove anything except in private meetings with a distinct possibility of technological trickery. The only "proof" he provided publicly was a forgery. There's also his incoherent technobabble during talks that suggests he either can't give a presentation to save his life, or (more likely) doesn't actually know what he's talking about. Finally, his proclivity to attack his opponents instead of making solid rebuttals. All of this is inconsistent with the Satoshi we knew from 2009, 2010. These are things which strongly suggest to me that CW is just taking advantage of the situation.
In the exceedingly slim chance that CW is indeed Satoshi, he's no longer fit for the job and should exit from the cryptocurrency space entirely.

I agree with and on this one. ASIC resistance is at best a temporary annoyance for chip designers until someone finds a design that is more profitable than CPU/GPU/FPGA. Knowing that, does it even make sense to pursue it in the first place? We've already seen it fail with litecoin the moment its market price stayed reasonably high. So what's the point? Are we going to hard fork every time someone builds a new ASIC? Can we even sustain the expectation that doing that is acceptable?
The goal shouldn't be to make it harder for people to develop mining equipment. The goal should be to ensure that such mining equipment is within reach of as many people as possible. To accomplish that, we actually want more people manufacturing ASICs. We need somebody, or somebodies, to provide strong competition to Bitmain. That alone can make a big difference.
IMO we need open hardware designs.
And then, there are the times when I think proof of stake might be the best answer.

And that still doesn't really invalidate my point.
The UASF helped, of that I'm sure. But Jihan was always willing to signal SegWit so long as he also got his precious hard fork. The Hong Kong agreement happened way before the UASF movement, and that's when Jihan's motives were made clear.
The NYA is exactly the same thing as the KH agreement, but excluding the core devs.
It's timeline was, of course, largely based on the UASF timeline. I wouldn't say that either the UASF or the NYA activated SegWit on their own. They worked together - if reluctantly.

No, two things needs to happen first:
1) It would need enough support to function properly in the first place
2) People who hold bitcoins would have to care about the security of the coins that would exist on the fork.
So it's only a problem if the new coin is taken seriously by many people, but not by enough people to make it the de-facto bitcoin replacement.
It's also a problem during the adoption phase, even if 2x is overwhelmingly popular, people aren't going to switch over instantly. While legacy bitcoin and 2x coexist, people who simultaneously care about the security of their coins on both networks are at risk.

The author says it's opinion at the end of the article. Opinions don't qualify as sources of newsworthy information.
Basically, he's suggesting that NVIDIA may screw with the main thing that gives GPUs an edge over CPUs for specific tasks. 
[The GPU is a general purpose processor that is made up of thousands of cores]( allowing for extreme multitasking, such as solving thousands of equations simultaneously. This happens to be useful for all the vector math involved in rendering 3d scenes at high framerates, but it's not limited to that. Using their products for general purpose computing is something that [NVIDIA encourages]( NVIDIA cards are used across the world for research, and it's common for business workstations to feature NVIDIA GPUs for acceleration of specific software like CAD, photoshop, video editing, 3d modelling and animation software, etc.
The very thing that makes a GPU good for gaming makes it good for mining altcoins, and doing a billion other things. You can't have one without the other.

Those are some good points. I wish merchant adoption had been a hell of a lot more positive over the last several years. Maybe now with SegWit and the potential of LN it can be, but I feel like we still have a ways to go before those things are baked into user friendly GUIs on all of the major platforms.
I also do think we'll need a block size increase, maybe even EC at some point, but it doesn't look particularly necessary right now.

The internet was founded on volunteerism.
When ads first started up, they were in poor taste, security risks, and used deceptive and dishonest tactics to get clicks (such as masquerading as Windows dialog boxes, download buttons, etc).
Google promised to end that era through its ad-sense program by running only vetted, text-only or static image advertisements. That lasted for a while, during which the idea of ads on the internet started to seem acceptable.
But Google abandoned its principles and we've returned to the old ways. Ads are once again relying on dishonesty to get clicks, and on top of this all the advertisers are tracking you.

Right. A distinction needs to be made between in-place hard forks, and segregating hard forks. In the latter case you can literally have two people doing CPU mining on board and get a tiny little network with 100% consensus. In the former case, it's extremely difficult because you need almost all the hash rate AND users to migrate over, otherwise there will be a war as to what group of people gets to keep the bitcoin branding.

Unless you own a very large stake in the network. Take a look at the distribution of hash power these days. Hell, there's reason to believe that some of those mining pools are not entirely independent.


The conspiracy theories fly both ways, but that's not the kind of baggage I refer to. The baggage I refer to is the desire by the miners to have the bitcoin developers in their pocket. They can't get the core devs so they hire their own. Kicking the can a tiny ways down the road isn't a useful thing to do, but if they can pull it off despite sound technical reasons to not bother, they'll have demonstrated that they can get away with circumventing bitcoin's meritocracy. And from there, who knows, maybe change bitcoin's inflation schedule a bit so that block rewards never drop below the current amount. They can hypothetically pull it off. They've got the hash power and they have bitcoin's merchant adoption by the balls.
Go online and search for merchants that accept bitcoin. You'll find they don't actually accept bitcoin. They accept BitPay. BitPay is also one of the few companies to have put their foot down and declared that they will be migrating to SegWit2x, and only SegWit2x, in *anticipation* of its succeess. They aren't waiting to see what the market decides. They don't have to, because as far as merchant adoption goes, they ARE the market. Oh, by they way, the world's largest mining pool and manufacture of mining hardware is their business partner.
Do you see? *A single corporation* dominates merchant adoption, and *a single corporation* dominates the mining and mining hardware space.
Go ahead and tell me that's "distributed consensus".

CW is unique in being the only person I know of so far to actively claim to be Satoshi in a serious context. And Gavin worked with Satoshi in the beginning, so it's easy to think he must know what's up.
But I think Gavin was fooled. Not because he's an idiot, but because he wasn't prepared to be skeptical. He didn't test to see if adding "CSW" to literally any message triggered verification. He didn't note the IP address associated with the file download for the bitcoin software. He didn't relocate the demonstration to remove the possibility of a covertly placed wireless access point. He didn't keep a copy of the signed message (CW didn't let him, despite it presenting ZERO security or privacy risk). Had he thought to do these things I'm reasonably certain we'd have cracked this case long ago.

No two way replay protection. Means supporting it is more difficult than it was to support BCH. Where do you draw the line between ignoring a fork outright and taking a great deal of time to support a fork that may not even happen? It will be very interesting to see how exchanges that support both coins deal with replays. In theory the user is in control of both ends of the transaction, both when depositing and withdrawing. They should be able to reverse replays, but we'll see.
Edit: to clarify, the user is not in direct control of the private keys on the exchange, but should be able to see their balance in both coins and initiate another transaction to "reverse" replays, at the cost of additional transaction fees. But the exchange needs to do a lot of work to monitor both chains and permit this functionality. Depending on the opportunity costs of putting their dev team and QA team and support team on that task, it may make the most economic sense not to bother in the first place.

Then we agree in most ways, because my interpretation of what Slush is saying here is that miners don't decide what chain gets the privilege of the name. 
If two chains persist with the same PoW algorithm, you're right in that one can attack the other and create large re-orgs and mutability. If miners did that, I think the chain under attack would be very justified in a PoW hard fork.
However, using hash rate to decide whether to support S2X or S1X on your exchange is still *a human decision* that every node operator will be making individually. Nothing in bitcoin forces you to install S2X software just because lots of miners are behind it. In fact, I would say that since mining costs a shit-ton and is only viable if you make enough return, that miners are going to be incentivized to make decisions based on another thankfully Sybil-resistant metric, the market price.

It's possible that they have a small dev team. You'd be surprised (or maybe not) at how much overhead/other considerations even a highly tech-focused company needs to keep going. And all the layers of management can add up to a game of telephone, where the upper management doesn't always get clear communication/direction from the devs... or just sucks at making decisions.
I worked for a web startup, the company was 50 employees, the dev team was 4. Some of these corporations ask their employees to work massive overtime instead of hiring new people. Devs aren't unionized and don't get paid overtime, if you don't do what you're told, you're laid off. So you've got a giant list of tasks, more than can actually be done. And sometimes your boss cuts the strangest of corners.

When Barry Silbert arranged the meeting in the first place, I thought he just did it because he had the means and was being legitimately selfless.
Now, it seems like the signatories to the agreement were also affiliated with his businesses. That's makes the NYA less of a consensus and more of a cabal.
I still don't hate it to the degree that other folks here do, but so long as it lacks replay protection, it's a solid "no" vote from me for sure. If the devs truly believe that it's the future of bitcoin, they need to patch their replay vulnerabilities and let the market decide. Of course I think they know that the market will not decide in their favor, for one simple reason: the market is largely apathetic to these forks in the first place, and simply stick with what they know.

It's in the hands of the market now, which is likely to dictate which chain the miners send their hash power too. We already known from the BCH fork that miners let greed overwhelm ideology, so they're likely to keep mining bitcoin as well. Aside from possible replay attacks I think it's going to be about the same scale of event as BCH. No point losing sleep over it. Market doesn't seem to give two shits, either.

I guess a less utopian view is that full nodes will be out of reach of most people, even if the block size doesn't increase, because nobody is going to be willing to spend a month downloading and verifying the blockchain before their node even catches up.
Maybe we're just delaying the inevitable here. But it's a good thing to do while the system is still young, IMO. If the future of bitcoin is that a few dozen large corporations control the network, let's try to make sure that doesn't happen until most of the battles over its fundamental properties have already been fought. Otherwise, corporate interests will pervert the shit out of it.
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:03:24
The difficulty system ensures that blocks are 10 minutes apart no matter how many miners get involved, no matter what happens with technology. It works well, and without it, bitcoin would entirely fail to function.
It doesn't lead to centralization because something much more fundamental is causing the centralization: electricity, hardware, bandwidth, and people's time all costs money. This adds up to a barrier to entry that prevents individuals from participating in any meaningful way unless they have some minimum amount of time/money to invest. In addition, even if you pass this barrier, the more money and time you have, the more mining hardware you can afford to buy and keep running. This concentrates mining into the hands of people with the deepest pockets.
But there is a way to reduce this problem. Right now, modern mining hardware is expensive. But what if you could get a credit-card computer like a Rasperry Pi with a mining ASIC stamped on it? What if that was $100? Yeah, you wouldn't make much running that. It might not even pay for itself in terms of electricity used and initial cost. But we know people will run full nodes purely out of enthusiasm and volunteerism. Those same people doing a little bit of mining as well would grow the size of that "other" slice of the pie in the mining market and help reduce the dominance of big corporate miners.
It's NOT OK for mining to be centralized. Just because we've lost centralization on that front, that doesn't mean we should allow centralization of full nodes. In fact, we should be actively encouraging ways to take back decentralization of mining.

The job of PoW is to do two things:

2. Decide between multiple VALID chains that use the same underlying protocol rules

@_date: 2017-10-18 20:21:42
I figure I'd cave for a moment and adopt, for sake of argument, the idea that miners are all that matter. I disagree with that, but let's do this anyway.
So, F2Pool reneged on the NYA. Some other smaller miners have as well.
[Here's where we stand](
Consensus is not a synonym for "majority", it is a synonym for "unanimity". You might have had some sort of claim to consensus back when NYA signalling was more than 95%, but you don't have that anymore.
Without consensus, *you are still "allowed" to fork*. Consensus doesn't dictate whether or not your are permitted to do something, it dictates how your peers (other nodes) react *after* you do it. If you don't have consensus, being stubborn and forging ahead anyway is just going to cost you time and money and your mental health.
What seems likely at this point is that a fairly large number of economic nodes are going to try to support both networks, while at least a few mining pools will continue mining status-quo-bitcoin. This will keep the network from completely stagnating and provide a means for the overall community to trade the chains against each other. That's where the market prices will come in to affect miner's decisions about which chain to mine.
I'm pretty sure we're keeping the status quo. The disapproval of the core devs *on technical grounds* is compelling. More clarifications by exchanges, payment processors, and miners will come. We might even see complete reversals of stance of some big names, if reluctantly and at the last minute.
At the end of the day I am pretty confident that even going by a "miners are all that matter" mentality, the miners's needs to make ends meet will ensure that they are beholden to some degree to a very broad "consensus" that includes non-mining stakeholders, and all of that will be mediated by the markets.

As to the rest of your comment, I think we disagree mostly on academic grounds. I certainly agree with your last two paragraphs and I think everything before that may come down to misunderstanding.
Let me completely reformulate my main point to see if you agree. I've been trying to make this point by explaining what bitcoin's internal consensus system actually does, but perhaps a better way is by explaining what it can't do.
There are two kinds of consensus. The first is between nodes and serves to create a single network unified by the same protocol rules and a single accepted chain. If your node uses different protocol rules, you are no longer a part of that network. If a sizable number of nodes disagree on the protocol rules, bitcoin has no mechanism whatsoever to reconcile this - all that happens is the network splits and the nodes on each side mutually reject each other's blocks. This is why *miners don't decide what is bitcoin*, because such reconciliation is left up to the second type of consensus. 
Social consensus. It's between people, who ultimately decide what node software to run. It's messy and prone to political BS and there's no way to fix that. Most arguments these days are centered around this type of consensus, and whether the NYA is enough. It ultimately decides how many nodes run software x or software y.
You need both types of consensus to do an *in-place* hard fork of bitcoin. That is, making a hard fork that still gets called bitcoin. To do a hard fork to an altcoin, you don't need social consensus, and consensus among nodes in your network, no matter how small, is assured. Many of us, including myself, assert that we do not have adequate social consensus to justify an attempt at an in-place fork.
Because of the way bitcoin works, a network *enforces* consensus. It is literally impossible for a bitcoin network to break consensus while still being a single unified network. This means that social consensus dominants any discussion of an in-place hard fork, because it is actually the only consideration.

Yeah, this is what I've come to expect from bitcoin. +/- 10% volatility on any given day, interspersed by boring periods of sideways movement, but an overall uptrend over the long term (in other words, zoom out).

The fact that Craig Wright remains unchallenged over his patents of bitcoin technology is probably the only real evidence we have that Satoshi Nakamoto may be deceased. Maybe it was indeed Dave Kleiman. Sure as hell wasn't Craig Wright. At best I'd say Craig knew of Dave's identity and death and is taking advantage of the situation.
If Satoshi is NOT deceased, the time to put Craig Wright is his place and save people from being scammed and predated on by a patent troll is now. If Satoshi wishes to never be involved again, however, let's just hope the lawyers see Craig Wright for what he is.

I agree, in the documentary Betting on Bitcoin he came across as well informed, passionate, and reasonably principled. That said it's hard to judge a person based on highly edited interview clips.
I've used his Shapeshift service and was impressed by it, but if he opposes the majority of his customer base he's going to have a bad time.
Bitcoin has opened up the possibility of a truly decentralized alternative (for some alt coins), however. Atomic swaps + some decentralized list of traders and offers will render his service, and similar services, partially obsolete. IMO that day can't arrive soon enough.

All of this has happened before. From the article:

It's the data, my internet plan wouldn't allow me to run a full node without overage fees due to the upload bandwidth consumed. I could keep the port closed and not connect to as many peers but the only reason I'm really interested in running a full node is to be part of the p2p network.
I'm sure people in my community *can* afford to run full nodes, but it's been priced out for me. I'm a student, and the internet we have is shared between 3 of us, watching netflix in high volume at times, and I even upload stuff to youtube, so... we're pushing it to the limit as it is. It's almost the highest tier package that the leading ISP offers, the next up is some overpriced thing targeted to large families of streamers, and the next after that is a business plan. My service is $100/mo, it goes up from there.
I'm OK with being priced out as long as I know that plenty of others can pick up the tab. But to make sure plenty of other people can run nodes, you kind of do have to be careful how big those blocks get.
Technology will improve, so we won't be stuck with 3 MB (that's more or less SegWit's limit) forever. But I appreciate that Bitcoin core is starting with attempts to make bitcoin more *efficient* before resorting to increase the block size any more. It's the right way around, IMO. Starting with increasing block size *before* improving efficiency is definitely the wrong way around.

Aside from PoW changes, however, I haven't heard too many constructive ideas about how to deal with mining centralization. Additionally, PoW changes to make the algorithm ASIC-resistant have historically only been at most a speed bump in the development of ASICs (see Bitmain's development of ASICs for Litecoin).
Mining centralization has been a major concern at least once before, when GHash.io gained more than 50% of the network's hash rate. The situation resolved itself when people switched pools, when GHash.io committed to limiting their hash rate, and when they eventually just vanished as a pool. So that situation was resolved, but didn't provide any answers as to how to prevent the same situation from re-occurring.

A deflationary currency would change the thought process a bit, I think. I suspect it would encourage more forward thinking in terms of finances, but maybe you're right that it won't change much. And this would not necessarily be bad. Some economists and scientists have even suggested the nations should embrace negative growth in terms of GDP in order to quash unsustainable raw resource consumption. Folks like Costanza and De Groot have been arguing along these lines (good names to keep in mind if anyone ever tells you that bitcoin is bad because deflationary currency = low GDP = recession = depression).
But sinking money in hobbies (even if video games) is not such a bad thing. But do you really need a Samsung Galaxy S8+ when you already have the S7? No, you don't, and if your economy is based around a deflationary currency you'll be more likely to weigh the need for a new thing versus the increased purchasing power you'll have if you wait for a few more models.

So, do you think that even if they didn't sign the agreement, they're on your side unless they say otherwise? If that's NOT your logic, then you can't claim that S2X has majority support. Yet this is what so many people are claiming. That a relatively small list of signatories is somehow the "bitcoin economy".

Here is how the network actually determines what is and is not bitcoin:
Step 1: is a chain valid according to your node? If no, ignore it.
Step 2: if there are multiple valid chains, pick the longest
Lots of nodes agreeing on the outcomes of those two steps creates a network.
So changing what "bitcoin" is requires two things:
Step 1: convince nodes to  change their rules.
Step 2: convince miners to switch their hash power over
Needing to do both of those things helps protect bitcoin from less inclusive, controversial changes.
By deferring to miners, coinbase, gemini, and others are eroding a layer of resistance against network changes. That isn't a particularly good approach. But I can understand the dilemma of these exchanges. No matter their decision, they are going to upset some customers. So they try to let the meta-network dictate their choice of node rules to avoid having to actively take a position.
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:03:55
But they only *actually* support it (mine it) when it's more profitable to do so. Talk is cheap. Mining is the true test of a miner's convictions.
I find that incredibly reassuring. It means that miners are likely to follow the money, and the market - which is a very inclusive system. The market determines a large chunk of what makes one coin more profitable to mine than another. Especially in the case of S2X, which doesn't have an emergency difficulty adjustment system.

Some governmental agencies praise it, others criticise it. The take home message really should be that your government is made up of many people with different opinions and expectations.

Others dig in and try to preserve the status quo. 
Expect mixed messages, because the messengers can't agree. Previous bitcoin hearings spent a lot of time focusing on money laundering, drugs, etc... And I'm sure we'll see more along those lines in the future. Really depends on who is in the room at the time.

People on this sub have always been welcoming to regulation that legitimizes bitcoin as a currency and/or safeguards it from more draconian measures.
Remember the bitlicense? It received quite a lot of optimism before it was drafted. People thought NY might become the bitcoin capital of the world. It was only until *after* it was drafted and people saw how draconian it was that it was turned against. So from this you should learn a simple truth: some regulation is bad (that's what we got), but some can actually be good.
Even though the Bitlicense was shit, other countries have introduced more useful regulation that gives bitcoin service providers some peace of mind that they aren't going to be randomly raided when the government ups and decides they don't like bitcoin after all.
And regulation only applies to services built on top of bitcoin. The base p2p layer is, as always, free for all (free as in speech, but definitely NOT free as in beer).
Yeah, it sucks that fees aren't a fraction of a penny any more, but what did you expect? They were only that cheap during early adoption when far fewer people used it. Fees are a self-regulating mechanism, they will absolutely change what kinds of transactions are worthwhile, but they won't make bitcoin useless. I am still hopeful that we'll find a way to enable micro-transactions. But they won't be individually recorded in the blockchain.

That's how TA works as well. When enough people see that StochRSI or MACD or whatever is showing a good time to buy, the buying pressure causes a price rise.

Yeah, that is why I haven't focused only on the bad.

As I understand it, yes, sort of, though his role has been described to me as somewhat "janitorial". Whether the strategy of having a lead maintainer works or not depends on how inclusive the devs are to new arrivals and if there is a solid contingency plan if the lead maintainer goes rogue. Most devs don't even have commit access, instead they write BIPs with reference implementations that Luke posts up, then someone with commit access can merge the reference implementation in, with changes as needed. Bitcoin has a lot of devs, but only a small number with direct can-do-anything access to the repo. Doing otherwise can result in disagreements manifesting themselves as an infinite loop of commit and revert, commit and revert, commit and revert. It is a bit of development centralization, but it can be kept in check by good practices in other areas.

The value of bitcoin can be measured in many ways. A full bitcoin is worth about $4k right now, but there are smaller units that are worth much, much less.
1 mBTC is currently worth $4. 1 Satoshi is worth $0.00004. Which of these units do use to compare to the dollar to decide which one is valued more? The correct answer is none of them.
To determine which is valued more, you have to compare the total value of all currently circulating bitcoins/USD. Compare bitcoin's market cap in USD to the amount of USD in circulation. It's imperfect but it's how you have to do it.
Because of bitcoin's limited cap of 21 million coins, it doesn't take too many people to make the price skyrocket. Supply is low, so demand doesn't have to be high to make the price high.
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:47:38
Most of segwit's features have nothing to do with block size considerations. It was made a soft fork because core wishes to make pretty much all protocol changes opt-in. The lengthy delay between rollout and activation represents time it takes for a community as large as bitcoin to arrive at consensus, and would likely delay a hard fork as well. When core devs have discussed the possibility of hard forks, it's often in the context of year-long consensus-finding processes.

Validity is determined by hard-coded rules in the software run by every full node and mining node. Hash rate is a secondary consideration used to protect against 51% attacks and serve as a tie-breaker when multiple chains are considered valid.

The point of SegWit2x was to find consensus for a scaling solution in order to avoid a further fracturing of the community. And that's giving it the benefit of the doubt, as there are far more sinister motives that some folks have pinned to it.
But giving it the benefit of the doubt, explain to me how then following up with creating a highly contentious hard fork does not somehow completely undermine the point of SegWit2x.

You realize that's how mining works too, right? The more money you have, the more mining hardware you buy. In mining, you literally buy support. 
Mining is not designed to settle disputes between people over which protocol to run. That is a decision that everyone makes for themselves, based on whatever factors they personally consider important.
Miners do two things apart from minting coins and packaging blocks: they make 51% attacks expensive as hell, and they help decide which chain is valid *within* an already coherent network (no disagreements over protocol). And that's it. Nothing about determining which of two totally different protocols gets the "Bitcoin" branding, nothing about forcing people to switch, etc.

The top post is by Jeff Garzik, Satoshi's example is a bit further down.
Satoshi's post is in pseudocode. Not only will it not compile as-is, it leaves the target block size open to debate, which is not a trivial decision to make. Additionally, a simple flag-day (activating whether you like it or not after a certain block height) is not a recommend method for deployment of hard forks, because it doesn't have any safeguards against things like lack of consensus and replay attacks. Satoshi's pseudocode should not be taken to mean that your job stops with those two lines. There is other work that must also be done.
One thing you also need to be aware of is the importance of consensus, something which Satoshi and most other core devs understand clearly. He suggested the consequences of lone wolf fork quite clearly:


But what happens when you've got a sizable bit of support, but still not unanimous consensus? That's where we find ourselves today, and it has much more detrimental effects than some random guy's node getting banned from the network.
We don't have consensus, therefore we don't have a safe in-place fork. It could be a safe fork with two-way replay protection, but nooo. Apparently that's too much to ask.

At home, I use [uBlock origin]( [Pi-Hole]( and [HTTPS Everywhere](
uBlock is just a basic browser plugin that uses black-lists to prevent your browser from requesting questionable content. Pi-Hole is the same idea for DNS lookups, so that even if your browser makes a request that gets through uBlock, it never reaches the intended destination.
uBlock and Pi-hole work well together, with each catching things the other doesn't. They also block tracking cookies, known phishing sites, and even annoying social media buttons. The people who maintain some of the block lists are *paranoid*, which suits me just fine.
HTTPS everywhere rewrites http requests to use https for domains that support https. Browsers have gotten better in recent years in terms of warning you when websites aren't use https properly, but it never hurts to take things a step further.
This is no longer about blocking ads, it's your security. IMO this kind of thing should be built right in to the web browser, but browser development seems more interested in adding stupid new features I'll never use (wanting me to create an account for my web browser? really?) as opposed to hardening their security and privacy.
I feel sorry for people just getting interested in cryptocurrency who have not already been inundated with these warnings and who could easily fall victim to this shit. And Google is an accessory to the crime IMO.

What are people's opinions on bitcoin's current ability to handle merchant-based mass adoption? Right now it seems to work fine for high-ticket items that have to be shipped to you; a few hours delay for the necessary confirmations and the few dollars in fees don't matter in that case. But what about a $20 t-shirt that you want to pay for and take out of the store in 5 minutes?
We need the lighting network for that - or a trusted third party like Bitpay who assumes the risk of 0-confs failing. The latter option is all we currently have, and not entirely in keeping with the spirit of bitcoin. Not to mention, they are about to go and switch to S2X...
I question whether bitcoin is ready for mass adoption, but the higher the price goes, the more people are going to try.

It has no replay protection, meaning that it doesn't create an entirely separate network, with transactions that are clearly limited to one or the other. It might unpredictably "replay" legacy transactions on the 2x network, making it difficult to separate legacy coins from 2x coins and reliably spend one without also spending the other. The only way to combat this risk is for 2x to take over entirely, or to fail entirely. This is one reason it might be considered a take over attempt - it's unsafe for it to coexist with the existing network.
If adopted, 2x would demonstrate that anyone with sufficient connections in the corporate bitcoin world can entirely circumvent all quality standards and peer review put in place by the bitcoin core devs. It's replacing one dev team with another. Another reason that it could be considered a take over attempt.
I was marginally in favor of 2x, but only when it seemed like it might have had broad consensus. It's a bit of circular logic to base my support on other people's support, but there's no other option when the damned thing lacks replay protection. There are only two good outcomes: either we all decide 2x is what we want and support it, or almost nobody does at all. Things in the middle get dangerous due to the potential for legacy transactions to get confused with 2x transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:03:45
The pressure to get companies to *tell us what they plan to do* exists because S2X has refused to adopt meaningful replay protection. S2X devs do not want the market to be able to decide in the first place.

You might be right, but contrary to all the wishful thinking, I don't think we'll see mass adoption of LN in less than two years.
And it all depends on how its used. LN will mean that fewer individual transactions are recorded on the block chain. So if LN doesn't attract new use cases and adoption, blocks will be smaller. Whether we need more space depends on whether LN leads to mass adoption of bitcoin itself. Hard to say.

Yes, we realize that a subset of the community is attempting to force their will on the rest of it. That's *WHY* we characterize it as a takeover attempt.
They are part of this community, they have a voice, but they can't expect to shout over everyone else without everyone else putting up a fight.
Thankfully, bitcoin is becoming at least partly immune to such things, because the value of a chain is determined by the entire market. Miners who wish to rebel will be mining less valuable coins. And the beauty of it all is that if they try to work around that with something like EDA, they have to make their fork even more incompatible with the original network, to such an extent that they would then have an altcoin.

We can debate about what fees are acceptable between the two of us, but let's say we come to some agreement and make a decision that we both like. Who are we to impose this on the economy?
Coming to some sort of collective decision, however, is *exactly* how the fees are set. Don't like them? Don't pay them. If enough people don't like them, use decreases, competition over block space decreases, fees decrease. It's just supply and demand.
$2 transactions have been priced out of the market, at least for now. Adoption of bitcoin happened rapidly enough that it outpaced innovation around scaling, although I blame some of that situation on the community's decision to argue for 2 years before actually implementing something.

You haven't seen a controversial hard fork until you've seen a PoW change. You think the miners might be playing dirty now, you just wait.
Not saying it's impossible, but you're not going to have much mining power on your side, and businesses are going to say "no thanks" as well, you can bet on that. So the only nodes that will be for such a plan are hobby nodes. Admittedly, that would be a return to the truly decentralized p2p cash concept, but it would be nothing more than an altcoin due to lack of broad support by industry.
We've already got an altcoin version of bitcoin that changed PoW - several in fact. And none of them are particularly popular. The closest is litecoin and its ASIC-resistant PoW has already been busted by Bitmain.

Ah, that's an easy thing to forget. Interesting, you're right in that it could make a difference to some extent. I see it as discouraging quick shuffling of hash power between chains to some extent, as needing to create more blocks in order to mature coinbase transactions from old blocks will provide some small inertia to mining on a chain.
Depending on what conspiracy theories you believe, we may already have seen massive scale manipulation of the bitcoin market back in 2013 with the Mt.Gox "Willy bot". Who knows, though.

He's dragged his heels this entire time on this issue, and the first "solution" to the problem wasn't a solution at all.

Go see comment for his take on what those quotes mean.
Luckily, we don't actually need to argue over their interpretation, because we have a working bitcoin system in front of us and can see exactly how it really works. And it suggests that Satoshi must have meant something rather different than what you think he meant.
The consensus that exists inside bitcoin does not bridge the gap between networks. Hash rate is not a consideration until *after* invalid blocks are rejected, so all forks see themselves as the one true fork. Incompatible nodes mutually reject each other's blocks and see each other's proof of work as invalid because it's generating invalid blocks. The result of bitcoin's consensus system is that nodes which get along form networks with each other, nodes which don't get along ignore each other. So one bitcoin becomes two. Consensus exists *within* the networks, but not *between* them.
But all that has to wait until *after* a fork has occurred. We're talking late November for SegWit2x. *Before* a fork occurs, bitcoin is even more powerless to affect the outcome. Bitcoin's nodes are operated by people who have complete freedom to install whatever software they want. Many people are being pressured to make initial decisions without waiting to see what the rest of the economy does. To try to avoid a split, groups of people will try to form agreements to run one piece of software over another. Those agreements may be broken as new considerations come to dominate. This is just people trying to figure out where to stand.
At the end of the day, Satoshi solved some interesting problems, but getting people to cooperate wasn't one of them and bitcoin's consensus system can't help us come to terms. People will make their decisions, and the network will fork. Then, people can adjust their decisions to cope with an evolving situation until some equilibrium is reached.
LT;DR: bitcoin's consensus system enforces consensus *within* networks, not *between* them. Only human intervention, not code, can find consensus between networks.

There's an easy way to tell if you don't have consensus from a *qualitative* point of view, and it goes like this:
Is somebody disagreeing?
Then you might not have consensus.
Are lots of people disagreeing?
Then you definately don't.
It's much easier to demonstrate that you don't have consensus than it is to demonstrate that you do.
Consensus requires that *nearly all* stakeholders are on the same page. Not 50%+, not 75%, but something very close to 100%. We've seem by corporate announcements, opinions from devs, and even arguments on social networks that we're nowhere close to that.
Bitcoin can't measure that, however. So it uses nodes and mining as a surrogate. This works well as long as the nodes/miners are adequately representative of the overall bitcoin community. The reason we are worried about centralization of mining is that it makes it very easy for a large discrepancy to occur between the miners and the rest of the ecosystem in terms of their incentives.

Miners chase profits. They're not in this business for anything else.
Signalling is easy, costs nothing. Switching hash power to a controversial fork... that's something very different.
Companies have been pulling out of the agreement and hedging their bets by deciding to offer both coins. That is the safe thing to do, economically, which means more will follow suit. This means that the market - traders and investors and average Joe users - will decide the relative value of the two coins.
And the relative value of the two coins decides where the hash power will be pointed.
At the end of the day, us "users" who you like to disregard as having no say in the system because we're not swimming in ASICs are going to be the ones calling the shots.

Litecoin is bitcoin with surprisingly minor changes. Its throughput is higher but not by much, and its scrypt POW algorithm has already been "broken" by ASICs. Anything that takes down bitcoin will take down Litecoin if it ever finds itself in the same position.
An ideal future is the survival of both bitcoin and litecoin. Atomic swaps mean that there is the potential for both networks to interoperate. Add other cryptos that can be atomically swapped and you get a meta-network of closely related cryptos that is even more resilient than any singular network.

The vast majority of moderation is pretty sensible - removing spam comments, low-effort shitposts. All of the major subs perform similar moderation.
The main thing I disagree with is not limited to and that is the use of stealth moderation tactics in which the target isn't even aware that they've been moderated. Part of moderation is to encourage users to change how they interact with the community. It's why when I was the admin of a web forum back in the 90s, I gave out more warnings than anything else.

Can't speak for anyone else, but I'm not against moderate block size increases. I am against SegWit2x due to their decision to roll it out in a way which encourages replayed transactions. At this point I am less hostile towards BCash than I am to SegWit2x. At least BCash stands on its own legs, without "poaching clients" from the bitcoin core network (as much).
They've received a lot of flak over this, but refuse to budge. So it's intentional, and the most likely explanation is that they want people who don't carefully avoid their fork to automatically be brought over to their side. Lack of replay protection also means that merchants are going to be inclined to take an all-or-nothing approach: there will be challenges associated with attempting to accept both coins simultaneously, yet still keep them separate.

The politics are one-sided and largely weighing down core's opposing parties.
If you can't get consensus, you do not fork without first making a fully separate altcoin (which is what BCH did, and why it's not a huge disaster). End of story. That is a technical consideration, not a political one.
There is no consensus - that's partly why these third party forks have *repeatedly* failed to attract sizable adoption. Bitcoin Cash is just the latest in a relatively long string of them. It's unique only in that it actually activated in the first place. Prior attempts required stricter activation schemes (some degree of consensus among the existing bitcoin network) that resulted in nothing at all happening. That's because prior schemes were hoping to transition the existing bitcoin network over, as opposed to creating an alternative network which is what Bitcoin Cash did.
2x is back to trying to shift over the existing bitcoin network, when we've already resisted such changes numerous times. Only this time, they exploited mining and corporate centralization so that a very small group of people are poised to shove it down our throats whether we like it or not, and are actively opposing techniques that would keep their network separate from ours, including methods to trick core nodes so that such separation can't even be implemented on core's end.
This is why we're hostile to it.

I suppose they could, but keep in mind that they have a peer review process which bt1 did not pass.
So asking them to switch sides and contribute to bt1 is actually asking for the complete abolishment of the peer review process - if devs don't like your code, you can get a bunch of businessmen to sign off on it then try to force the devs to switch to your repo.
So to keep the meritocracy that safeguards bitcoin from stupidity, the core devs should probably refuse to cooperate. They should not be lowering their standards.

It's not the 2MB block size that bothers most people, it's the politics of the fork itself. SegWit2x represents a possible failure of governance decentralization. A small group is attempting to force a network change. That's why we dislike S2X, and why we extend our distrust to those who support it.
You seem like a genuinely intelligent person, yet you are deflecting away from the real issues people have with SegWit2x; you even refuse to call it by name in your post above. It's not SegWit and a 2MB base block size I oppose, it's the political baggage that SegWit2x comes with.
It's also worth pointing out that you stand to gain from *ANY* half-successful bitcoin fork, because it will generate a lot of cross-trading, and your service is very useful for that. It's how I converted my BCH to BTC. But I'm going to think twice about using it to convert S2X coins to BTC. I am not sure I want to be lining your pockets anymore.

Hashrate and the structure/composition of the bitcoin network. The latter can't be put into an equation simply, it requires a simulation (which is no less scientific) that will give you a probabilistic outcome of the health of diverging clusters.
Hashrate and network structure will decide which fork even works properly. Market value will influence all of this. It can all be swayed by public opinion.
Measuring public opinion is actually possible using natural language processing, but nobody is doing that and it's obviously not immune to Sybil attacks. Bitcoin is doing the best it can by basing its consensus on hash rate and node enforcement. But that is susceptible to attack as well, because you can spin up more hash rate and node enforcement by throwing money at it. The assumption when using hash rate as a metric of consensus is that miners will defer to the overall economy, otherwise they'll lose money. I think they probably will (mostly), but like to talk big and posture as a way to try to influence things.
In short, you can't measure consensus with an equation, because it's a human process. You can try to simulate it, but I expect you will not be able to make precise predictions. Bitcoin is doing the best it can to come up with a metric of consensus, but because of the problem I just mentioned, it's flawed and always will be. But that doesn't mean it's bad - the least flawed option is always the best choice.

I think he holds a grudge against *bitcoin core*. Maybe they told him off once when he thought he had a good idea or something.
He's not confused OR stupid, he's being intentionally dishonest. One of the things he likes to tell people is that SegWit *gets rid of* witness data, making bitcoin unsafe. He never bothers to tell people that this is only true if the network only consists of legacy nodes. Legacy nodes see an absense of witness data because they don't know where to look for it. SegWit nodes see the witness data just fine.
He tells people this to undermine bitcoin core yet supports SegWit2x, which includes SegWit. He's not stupid enough to be oblivious to that contradiction. It's intentional dishonesty.

You can't increase base block size with a soft fork, no matter how hard you try. SegWit is about as close as you can get.
The reason is hard for me to put into words, but it has to do with whether the change you're making permits transactions that would have otherwise been considered invalid. That is what causes a hard fork. Soft forks only permit changes that make rules more specific such that future transactions are still valid according to the previous, less specific rules.
Because increasing base block size would make some blocks invalid to legacy nodes and miners due to being more than 1 mb, it would create a chain split in the network.
SegWit is a bit of a weird beast. It's an apparent contradiction at first, because it allows blocks to be larger than 1 MB. But at the end of the day, the part of the SegWit transactions that the legacy nodes can see/understand still conform to the old rules, so it works.

Agreed. That's the central reason why I've adopted the "miners don't decide what bitcoin is" philosophy. They only decide what bitcoin is *for themselves*.


"Less secure" does not mean "not secure". Having the same PoW, however, allows miners to DOS attack the minority chain, but doing so would cost them.
Even now, however, we can't predict which chain will be the minority chain. What miners say they'll do and what they'll actually do might end up being different things.

And it's already been increased beyond 1 MB in two entirely seperate networks - the existing core SegWit network, and the Bitcoin Cash network. Moreover, the bitcoin cash network, which was an intentional chain split, was created and supported by the same miners who promoted the NYA as a way to avoid a chain split.
You're giving the remaining S2X supporters a level of trust that they simply do not deserve.
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:51:15
I think eventual immutability may be difficult to guarantee at first. Especially since the two chains have exactly the same PoW, we can expect miners might flip-flop (though not nearly as rapidly as with BCH) to exploit differences in profitability. At least at first, I expect they will mine the chain with the highest market price, but some die-hard supporters will always mine a minority chain, so difficulty will eventually adjust and tempt miners to switch.
All things considered it's a bit of a mess.

No amount of wishing on your part is going to change the fact that Bitcoin has NOT found a way to arithmetically determine whether there is consensus between *irreconcilable protocols*. Literally the only thing bitcoin can do is ensure that incompatible networks are kept separate. Bitcoin does NOT have an internal governance structure. 
What gets called "bitcoin" is a human decision, not one made by code. It's an emotional decision. We can see this very clearly in all of the different ways exchanges, payment processors, and user groups have decided to "measure" consensus. Bitcoin *does not* provide a way for us to do this. Proof of work *doesn't do this* because it is not an inclusive process. Proof of work only does its magic once people have already made their decisions.
On this, we fundamentally disagree and probably always will.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:45:25
The terms you have to work with here are "encryption" and "hashing". The first is two-way, the second is one-way. However, they are very commonly referred to simply as "two-way encryption" and "one-way encryption". Even by cryptographers.
Hashing is the technique bitcoin uses to convert private keys to public keys. AKA "one-way encryption".
Sure, you can obsess over colloquial vs technical use of words, but that's not how you distinguish a skilled person from an unskilled person. In fact, the skilled people know that when addressing a general audience, you use a word like "encryption" instead of "hashing", because your audience generally knows what "encryption" is and thinks hash is fried shredded potatoes.

The possible success of 2x will represent unacceptable centralization IMO, but I suspect much of the market will just shrug and use whatever they're told to use. I think the cryptoanarchists and cypherpunks have become a minority.

Hell, he provided *forged* "evidenced" and deleted it shortly after people called him on it, and the private evidence he provided to Gavin and that reporter guy could be easily faked even by me, and I'd describe myself as a script kiddie at best. You just need a wireless access point and a computer with a web server and DNS server. Couple hours of programming maybe. Gavin let his critical thinking skills go on vacation because he wanted to believe. Meanwhile, CW prevented Gavin from documenting any of the technical details that would allow independent verification.

I agree.
But there is no consensus, and you're not going to get one for the time being. Even if you can get most core devs on board with the idea, there's still going to be some devs who opposite it, and a sizable number of other people including some proportion of node operators who don't want blocks to get any larger at the moment.
"Consensus" doesn't mean majority, it means 100% or so close that it hardly matters.
Maybe it'll look less objectionable in the near future, however.

The secret is to be a student and only cash out in smallish amounts so that you don't go above the poverty line.

The graph shows a fairly evident non-linear trend, so it'll probably even be less than 1.5 years, but it'll likely slow down as it approaches 100% and end up being a sigmoid curve, which is a fairly common pattern for technology adoption.

The other side of the debate is claiming to have consensus based on getting a surprisingly small group of people in a room and having them sign something that wasn't even fully fleshed out until later. You think that's better?
Sure, social media users are probably creating a multitude of accounts to provide the appearance of more support on one side than the other, upvoting themselves or whatever. But consensus requires *nearly 100% support*.
And if you're worried about a Sybil attack, you can restrict your field of view to only those individuals with confirmed, non-anonymous identities. 
A *single* "nay" kills consensus, strictly speaking. We can shrug off a few minor nay votes, but we can't shrug off statements from multiple independent corporations, all of the core devs, and user groups around the world.
Your arguments have some truth to them - you can Sybil all sorts of shit. Including hash rate (it's just expensive). All voting systems can be manipulated, including bitcoin's network.
The good news for you, since I'm guessing you believe that hash rate is all that matters, is that hash rate will indeed determine the health of the two chains, and which one survives in the long run.
But those miners are people, they want to make money, and they're going to be watching the market. The market is the closest you're going to get to a quantified and Sybil-resistant measurement of the entire community's confidence in the two chains. And that will feed back on the miners and influence their decision about which coin to mine.
At the end of day, bitcoin only really pays attention to hash rate (and whether those chains are valid), but the hash rate isn't some emotionless thing which adheres to silly agreements just because.
I am hoping that plain old economics will ensure that miners are *forced* to act in accordance with the broader wishes of the community.

I caved and submitted some of my details to a Canadian exchange called Vault of Satoshi in 2014 to buy some bitcoins. Some time later VoS decided to close up shop. They were purchased by Kraken, based in the US.
Kraken now has my information - I know this because I am verified there, they e-mailed me as much, and they are bound by KYC requirements as well.
It doesn't really bother ME that much because I ended up using Kraken's services due to the convenience of already being verified with them, but when I stop and think about the situation, it's a bit... odd.
People's private information (not just mine) was sold to a foreign company. Names, driver's licenses, addresses, and trading histories.

*Bitstamp themselves* disabled your 2FA for someone who pretended to be you. The fact that this vulnerability exists renders their service unsafe.
Never use bitstamp again, and speak out against it to everyone who asks. If you're lucky, Bitstamp will own up to their mistake out of pocket in an attempt to buy you back. In which case you take the bitcoins and still don't return.
Unfortunately, if they make a habit of doing that, it just renders *them* open to theft by the same weakness. The only solution is for them to adopt a zero-tolerance policy of not disabling 2FA or resetting passwords or actually doing anything at all to anyone's account just because some guy called them and asked nicely. Customer support shouldn't even have the means.

Are you familiar with open source software? There's a concept of a fork, where a group takes a project that already exists and makes changes to it so that it goes off in a different direction. Different features, different ideology, etc.
The bitcoin community has developed dissenting opinions on how it should scale to accommodate future demand for limited computing resources. Many of these different ideas have given rise to forks of bitcoin. "Bitcoin core", which is considered the official bitcoin reference implementation, is taking a very slow, methodical, and multi-faceted approach that is rubbing some folks the wrong way.
Bitcoin core has opponents who want a scaling solution more quickly, and with less complexity. People in this camp have put together a multitude of forked implementations over the years, but the majority never gained any widespread support. Somewhat recently, however, a group of miners controlling 95% of bitcoin's block-creation computing resources, as well as a number of businesses involved in offering bitcoin services, threw their weight behind a fork of bitcoin called SegWit2x.
This fork differs from previous ones in two key ways. The first is that it had a lot of support from miners, who some believe should essentially control bitcoin outright. The second is that instead of creating an entirely separate fork of bitcoin, proponents of SegWit2x wanted to shift existing bitcoin clients over to their software, removing Bitcoin Core from the equation.
The two sides here are essentially at war with each other. The drama has be quite something.
Recently, miners and business supporting SegWit2x have begun to hedge the bets and in some cases outright withdraw support for SegWit2x. On this forum, this is widely seen as good news because we view SegWit2x as a coup attempt.
Now if you want a truly unbiased perspective, you'll have to spend days reading across multiple sources of information. But I tried to offer the least biased take on it as I could, considering that I'm firmly withing the Bitcoin Core camp.

Yeah, you're safe as long as you pay attention to future developments and only transact once the dust settles. Keep in mind, there may be little to no problem at all. There is still time (barely) for Jeff Garzik to cave and implement proper two-way replay protection. If he does, there is much less reason to worry. Just pay attention to how any services you use are deciding to operate, because even with replay protection, it's up to services and exchanges as to which coin (or both) they will work with.

You don't measure it at all. You don't need any consensus at all to fork bitcoin. Just go ahead and do it.
The word "consensus" is thrown around so loosely, and has at least two different meanings (Nakamoto consensus vs social consensus) that are just assumed, but seldom explicitly explained.
Nakamoto consensus has absolutely nothing to say on this issue.
The only thing that can determine the success or failure of S2X are human decisions, and each person makes those decisions however the hell they want to. Social consensus can coordinate such decisions, but for controversial forks you'd have to be some sort of God-like diplomat to arrange that properly.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:32:09
Those are fair points.
Nevertheless, it seems to me that you realize that this sort of decision - whether to support S2X or not, comes down to individual choice. Maybe hash rate is the most objective way to measure community support, but objectivity is not the only consideration. A measurement is only useful if it is unbiased or can be corrected to account for that bias. There are reasons to suspect (based on community reactions, as subjective as that is) that the miners are not doing a good job representing the community, and we have no way to correct this bias.
IMO this doesn't indicate a failure of bitcoin's internal consensus system because it does not seem to be intended to serve this role in the first place. "One CPU one vote" applies to agreeing how to order the transactions within blocks and the blocks within the blockchain in a system whose rules are already agreed upon. How to resolve fundamental protocol disputes is outside of that mandate.

You're too used to the rampant consumerism that characterizes our society.
Deflationary currency *will* encourage less spending. Economists will bemoan a reduction in GDP, but they only see one side of the story. Accelerating consumerism is unsustainable. We generate too much waste in our societies, and people impulse buy stupid shit all the time. A deflationary currency makes you question your purchases more before buying. That is a good thing. You still end up buying what you need, but fewer novelties. The result? You have more financial security and less useless shit laying everywhere (and/or laying in the landfill).
I won't spend my bitcoin on coffees and similarly cheap things. Not right now, anyway. But I would pay for rent and groceries with it, as well as expensive purchases like computer equipment, musical instruments, camera gear.
It would be different if I was getting paid directly in bitcoin, in which case I know any bitcoin I spend would be replaced soon anyway. I'd be far less hesitant to spend.

Why is it so important to you that the block size be increased as a "base block size increase"? 
If your answer would be "because SegWit adoption will take time", then that's a hard to defend stance. Because SegWit's rate of adoption is determined by users. If they want the block size increase it provides badly enough, it would be adopted rapidly.
If instead, SegWit takes a long time to be adopted, then I guess people didn't need that block size increase after all. If bitcoiners are largely apathetic, that's the root problem - not the technical details of how we go about increasing scalability.

Satoshi's white paper is talking about determining validity of multiple chains that otherwise meet all other protocol rules. There can only be one valid chain in a unified network, so you need an additional measurement of validity when there's multiple otherwise valid options. Hence the tie breaking chain length.
For your interpretation to be true, consider the implication of this statement:


For your interpretation to be true, nodes would have to be able to dictate "validity" to other nodes. We know they do not do this. Every node decides validity independently and based almost entirely on rules hard-coded into the node software. Hash rate breaks ties due to latency and protects against certain attacks *within* a network that are still considered valid. Hash rate has nothing useful to say about resolving a protocol conflict between two different networks.
In the case of two competing chains with different rules that make them incompatible, nothing will resolve those differences short of human decisions. They are not the same cryptocurrency as the far as the nodes are concerned. Chain lengths in network A will not impact on decisions made by nodes in network B and vice versa.
Given that the networks consider networks operating on different rules to be fundamentally different cryptocurrencies, your interpretation would rename Litecoin to "Bitcoin" should it ever overtake us. But no. That is not how things work, and not how they should ever work.
Edit: [I am not the first to respond]( to this overused and always out-of-context quote from the whitepaper. But nobody learns. It's a shame that post was downvoted because the discussion inside would have had greater visibility.

I'm starting to think this may be so.
Proof of stake? It can't benefit from specialized hardware, so it lowers the barrier to entry and brings home users back into the game. A lowered barrier to entry = more competition. 
It still centralizes based on wealth but I don't think it'll be as bad as POW, which enables centralization not just based on wealth (mining hardware costs money) but by centralized production of mining hardware and all of the IP law surrounding it.
But I say we let Ethereum be the guinea pig, and consider it some years down the road if it actually works well.
An alternative option is a POW algorithm that is truly ASIC and GPU resistant. But I don't think that is actually possible.

They've been increasingly tightening regulations on bitcoin all along, and we've been taking poorly translated announcements and fretting over their meaning that entire time. It's also a country with strict currency controls that bitcoin helps people circumvent, so it was just a matter of time before they put their foot down.
What would be less expected and much more damaging to the price is if a less authoritarian government, like the US, Japan, or Korea, moved to make bitcoin exchanges and/or mining illegal or requiring prohibitive permits.
On the other hand, major adoption breakthroughs could take the price of bitcoin through the roof.
None of these things are predictable except by insiders.
You could try going to for predictions based on often-wrong technical analyses. Take everything there with a grain of salt. But in some cases I do believe it's better than a coin toss, at least.

CSW's live demonstration is believable to people who haven't read much more about him. He's a conman. People don't believe in conmen *knowing* that they're conmen. They only realize it later, and if it means not having to accept that they've been foolish, they may not *want* to know.
Besides, even if OP continues to believe in CSW's claim, an understanding of LN is independent of that and will eventually lead people to realize that CSW is a moron.

He's made the outright claim at least four times.
Two in private, to Jon Matonis and Gavin Andreesen during which he presented signed messages that supposedly proved his claim. Two claims and associated "proofs" in public, both of which were rapidly debunked - one was a backdated PGP key, and the other was a cut+paste signed message taken from the blockchain (re-using signed messages is something any of us can do, so proofs need to be entirely unique).
It's not possible to debunk his private "proofs", however, since Jon and Gavin were not permitted to reveal the signed message due to supposed "privacy" concerns. Of which there are none, in fact. It seems to me that CSW just didn't want us independently verifying the signed message. I wonder why...

The entire point of bitcoin is to NOT run it like a bank.


We've seen that problems can arise when mining nodes are held by a minority. Having non-mining nodes equally centralized will exaggerate the same problems we already face: small groups capable of forcing their will on the entire network.
The only thing we need to act as incentive for people to run nodes is that they understand the importance of doing so. As long as running them is suitable inexpensive, people will do it as a hobby.

Slush lets their miners decide how to signal in some way, right? I'm fine with that, even if it means they do mine some NYA blocks. Every pool should be letting their miners decide signalling, IMO. Not that signalling *really* matters right now, because it only has meaning when directly coupled to activation systems, and that day has long since passed.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:16:23
Yet, but let's put that in perspective:
The [gross world product]( was about $78 trillion in 2014, while the [US GDP]( was about $18 trillion.
So the entire USA makes up 23% of the world's nominal GDP (less if you account for relative purchasing power). While that is certainly up there, it's still a minority of the total.
IMO, the USA's true potential influence over bitcoin comes through their heavy-handed application of regulations to foreign countries combined with extradition treaties.

If you brought all the data for bitcoin price vs time into excel and fit an exponential curve, you'll find it fits reasonably well.
But that is only useful as a way to explain the past. The guy you're responding to is trying to extrapolate into the future. Doing so is non-scientific, but because it feels more objective than reading entrails, it's still a thing that people try to do.
In reality, the moment bitcoin deviates from the trend line I make today, I can just make a different one tomorrow. There is reason to believe that technology adoption rates are actually sigmoid -slow at first, then mass adoption, then a slow trickle out to people who held off for longer than others. This means that some point in the future bitcoin prices might be expected to break off from an exponential curve and begin to stabilize. At least that kind of analysis attempts to bring in an understanding of how people interact with technology, but even that is pretty useless - it doesn't let you predict *when* the exponential growth will give way to saturation.
Literally anything could happen, though.

If you mean something like inflation/deflation or interest rate that a person or central authority controls, then no.
The main adjustment that is made, automatically and without human input, is called difficulty. Its purpose is to ensure that bitcoin's transaction throughput and money supply remain predictable in the long term no matter how hard people try to upset that. You can influence it on short time scales at great cost... but over the long term, you're a slave to math. This is partly why bitcoin can be kept relatively free of undue influence by large organizations/nations. We still have issues, but all things considered it all works reasonably well.

It's not a problem from a technical point of view. Fees go up to counter it, spammers have to waste shit tons of money. End of story.
Pointing it out is still useful, however, as a counter to what BCH proponents will say about the temporary fee raise. They'll say "look, bitcoin fees are high", cherry picking that one time that the spam "attack" happened. We need to point out that it was a very temporary situation, possibly an "attack", and cost the "attacker" shit tons of money.

There's a myriad of laws and limits, different in every country, above which you'll find yourself investigated or getting phone calls, with your funds held by the feds, until you can prove they were acquired legitimately. Try to avoid that by staying under the limits, and you'll either have a hard time selling your bitcoin fortune in any speedy manner, or you'll get investigated for "structuring".
I wouldn't be too concerned about selling $1000 here and there. But anything over $10k (in Canada) and I should really be speaking to an accountant/lawyer first. Make sure I can explain (with proof) how I acquired the coins. I bought them on a defunct exchange... not sure what proof I could possibly offer. I'd rather hold, occasionally buy something on Newegg or whatever, and wait for this mythical mass adoption.
It's not that it's impossible to sell them, it's that it's annoying enough and I'm hesitant enough that I don't. And that is all that matters in the context of this discussion - people living in some low-income dive can have $100k in bitcoin. It's not a contradiction.

No, they are trend lines because they fit the data post-hoc. Once the data no longer fit a previous trend line, people just fit an altered one.
This is why in science you are warned, strongly, against extrapolation from non-explanatory models. If you want to predict something, you generally need ot understand how it works and create a model that accounts for things like human behavior and rare stochastic events. Then perform stochastic simulations with sensitivity analysis to determine a *range* of possibilities, along with how those possibilities change if you're wrong about how the system works.

That's an ineresting point, and if that's how taxes worked I can only imagine our society would be a LOT less wasteful. We do pay taxes on consumption, actually pretty high taxes (15% sales tax on basically everything where I live), but income tax and capital gains tax still makes up a large chunk. If there was zero income tax and capital gains tax, and 30% sales tax instead, it would change people's behavior for sure. They'd want to save more, and they'd be more likely to hit retirement with an actual nest-egg. But GDP isn't measured by the amount in people's bank accounts, so this will never happen. GDP must always increase, no matter the cost to people's health and wellbeing... or at least that seems to be what the politicians and mainstream economists believe.

Core did not agree to the HKA, because core was not present.
A few core devs were, and they can't speak on behalf of the entire team. None of the devs can.
If the devs who were present DID in fact put out their own 2x fork, it would still be just another third party fork unless the rest of the core devs were on board.
Most of this "debate" is happening because people are unable or unwilling to understand that bitcoin core is not a corporation with centralized top-down leadership. The very idea of this not being the case seems to be incompatible with some people's ideas of project management and corporate structure. But it's how it is, whether you like it or not.

It does have overwhelming miner support, that much is pretty certain so long as you assume that signalling support = true support (which is pretty safe). But miners are not bitcoin's lawmakers. ALL fully validating nodes are, of which they comprise a subset.
For that reason, it's quite unclear if there's even a majority of support, and it's very clear that there's no consensus. No consensus, no fork. At least not one without strong, non-optional replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:07:26

Yes. For all its faults, at least Bitcoin Cash did not pretend to be the original Bitcoin. The devs put it out there, gave it proper replay protection, and let the market decide what to do with it.
S2X, for whatever reason, is attempting to convince people it is the one true bitcoin, and has been waffling on replay protection (without which it's more difficult to trade both coins independently). If they just added strong two-way replay protection and let the market freely decide the value of the two coins, they would basically guarantee that they become an altcoin. It's just my opinion, but I believe they are counting on SPV nodes/wallets to follow their chain without the end user even knowing that they were switched over.

Oh, for sure. But this time he's screwed up in a new and more screwy-upy way. This time, a court is involved. And while courts take their sweet time and sometimes misstep, they're also good at getting expert testimony.
If the case is as simple as datestamps and demonstrating that many of these addresses are owned by other people, he's not going to have a good time. The case will probably get thrown out of court, and all his friends who trusted him because he convinced them he was Satoshi/had all those bitcoins are going to start questioning him. Hell, it's quite possible that actual fraud charges are in his future.
Edit: it's extra weird, though, because showing that he doesn't actually own these bitcoins would be his *defense*. Meanwhile, letting the trial continue while keeping up the ruse would require that he submit fabricated evidence, potentially getting him in even deeper trouble. Either way there's a pretty good chance he's screwed.
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:50:36
A combination of hash rate and agreement among non-mining economic nodes is all that matters as far as bitcoin itself is concerned. 
But there is a social side to hard forks as well. People who aren't miners or even running nodes still move the markets, and they can influence the opinions of miners and economic nodes. This is a somewhat messy part of consensus discovery and is the part you're seeing in action now. It's kind of like calling your senators before they get together and vote on something.
And after they vote, we get another chance to make our opinions known by deferentially trading the two chains. If one becomes far less valuable, it is unlikely to succeed.

It can't be spent anonymously, but you can never be sure the person who spent some BTC was the sold custodian. This is especially so if the coins are moved a bit before being spent.
IMO anyone who *needs* that money for something important, or with which quality of life would be greatly improved, would be foolish not to spend at least some of them. It might raise questions, but there will be plenty of plausible deniability.
And even if people think you might be Satoshi, well... doesn't stop Dorian or Nick Szabo from carrying on with life. No big bad men came to take them away. Although I understand Dorian was harassed quite a bit...
Do we even know for sure they were mined by Satoshi and not just a super-early adopter?

Because democracy makes decisions based on simple majorities (51%+). Democracy allows minority groups to be brutalized at the hands of a simple majority.

We've repeatedly been fooled by rumor. In the past, every single Chinese "ban" has had inside sources saying "uh... first we've heard of it, but our bank is clamping down on wire transfers".
IMO you've got this a bit mixed up. It's not that China is repeatedly threatening and then retracting bans. Instead, they have gradually and repeatedly increased the scope of regulations. In some cases doing nothing more than issuing warnings.
What you're seeing is *third parties* taking advantage of the situation, people's lack of ability to read Chinese, and shit quality Google translations of Chinese announcements to manipulate the market by greatly exaggerating the situation. So I don't believe it's "China" manipulating the market, but others. Daytraders with Twitter accounts.
And it seems to have happened again with this claim that mining is now being targeted. It would be very interesting to figure out who started that rumor.
But the exchanges shutting down, ICOs being banned... that's real. And it's the first time "China" has actually done it. Previous instances were warnings from PBoC, individual banks refusing to do business with bitcoiners, etc.

Non-mining nodes and miners are on exactly equal footing for determining validity. As I already explained, chain length is only used as a tie-breaker between chains that are considered valid. The length of an invalid chain doesn't matter one bit.
This is, as I already mentioned, determined on a per-node basis, and the collection of nodes give rise to an emergent network.
I'm just saying what I've already said, but reworded to maybe help you understand.
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:53:40
My apologies for the assumption. I'm on the offensive today :p
The definition of consensus is in the dictionary and Bitcoin was never trying to redefine it (as far as I know). Bitcoin doesn't measure consensus; it enforces it. The closest it gets to measuring consensus is when Bitcoin core devs used hash rate as an activation mechanism. A tactic that might never be used again by bitcoin core.
I guess you're trying to get people to think only in terms of what bitcoin considers to be consensus, and that's fair enough. But right now you can't even measure that. The miners say one thing, do another. The agreement means nothing until it's acted on. What is the hash rate for S2X? The answer is we don't know because S2X is a month away and talk is cheap.
And it's not as simple as "longest chain wins". It's "longest *valid* chain wins", and the validity is determined by all nodes individually. Non-mining nodes don't simply bend over and take whatever the miners give them. They accept only those chains that conform to their rules. Only if the node considers the chain valid is length even a consideration.
You ask how consensus is measured - it isn't. Consensus is a process and until the fork occurs we can only guess as to the outcome.
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:18:41
Of course, but you'll still have to tell your government where you got the bitcoins to buy a house. "I bought bitcoins in 2014" is a statement that will likely need proof.

I wouldn't even consider Bitcoin a halfway stable investment. Gox collapsed only 3 years ago, and the bitcoin economy is still hugely centralized. If Coinbase or Bitpay have major problems, we're in trouble. If China bans bitcoin mining, we're in trouble. Not to mention we frequently see 5-10% rise/fall in Bitcoin on any given day even when nothing much is happening at all. That's kind of the opposite of stability. Meanwhile, you can almost predict the price of Ethereum weeks in advance. $300. It has barely budged in months. So maybe "stability" is not the right word choice.
I think most people in crypto with a lot on the line should be hedging their bets at least a bit. So what altcoin to pick? Probably one of the top 10 to be sure, but above that, something radically different from bitcoin. If bitcoin fails, it will ultimately be due to a technical fault. If you hold a bit of some crypto that's radically different from bitcoin, it's less likely that a technical failure in bitcoin will be a common problem with your other crypto(s).
For a variety of reasons, I don't think being a bitcoin maximalist can be defended on logical grounds. It's purely an emotional state.

I might be willing to buy such a thing for half of your asking price if it were built really well, particularly if the movement was satisfying and were based on a custom time range, or at least a few choices on a rear-mounted selector switch. You should provide videos of the movement, and I'd expect it to also have a "sideways" state when a [robust regression]( of the price did not have significant slope.
Cheap servos are noisy, so this would be a consideration as well - how often it moves and if it has a tendency to spaz out during periods of high volatility. Using something like a robust regression instead of just comparing start and end prices will help to make sure it's less spazzy.
These are the sorts of things that will determine if it's a cool toy to keep on a desk, or an annoying glitch fest. Buyers need some way of assessing that before they buy.

Since you mentioned the monthly report, I took a look.
I think the problem is the percentages they report are not explained. Very easy to misinterpret. You'll notice that the percentage of content removed for and add up to 100%. That 88% figure does not refer to the percentage of posts/comments that were removed, but the percentage of removals on relative to the amount of removals across the three subs. Two of which were not even tracked for half of the time and so have deliberately undercounted values.
They could fix all of these problems easily by reporting a percentage of total posts/comments removed *within* a sub as a daily average. But that still leaves the problem that it all lacks context. People getting upset at 3k removed posts might feel less so when they read the posts/comments in question.
I commented in their monthly report something along those lines. We'll see if anything changes.

I would say a major flaw of all cryptos, even the ones that claim otherwise. The only reason the fees of other cryptos are low is because their blocks aren't full. This is the price of popularity.
That's why we keep waiting for things like the lightning network. Failing that, at least highly integrated atomic swaps so that the transaction load can be effectively spread across multiple cryptos.

You don't seem to acknowledge the existence of the immune or central nervous systems in that exceedingly bad analogy of yours. Maybe think of a better one next time.
You have a right to free speech, but you don't have a right to a free venue. This is a privately run website, so there are rules. In my house, I kick you out if you insult the other guests. Same story here. Deal with it.
Now I've repeatedly asked for links to this decentralized community that you keep discussing as if it exists in reality. Why haven't you provided any? Your ideas are nice in theory, but until a working example exists - at scale (millions of users) - then it only exists on paper. Bitcoin only truly "worked" in my mind until recently, after demonstrating many times that it can survive in the face of all sorts of BS being thrown at it. A decentralized community is something I would take part in, but I'd remain skeptical until the community grew large and was subject to the same sort of hate and attempted attacks that any other community would be subject to.
I'm not saying your ideas are bad. I'm just saying that I'm *skeptical* they'll work, though I welcome you to prove me wrong. You can't do that through some wishy-washy analogy or thought experiment. Make the community, or at least find it. In the meantime, we either accept the rules of the communities that DO exist, or we don't say anything at all. Them's the rules.

Yeah, I get that you're working with limited tools. It sounds like reddit needs to give you guys more tools for countering the cycle of banned users just making new accounts and going right back at it.
It was easier in the 90s. Forums required memberships with verified e-mail addresses, which were harder to sign up for in mass quantities. If you banned someone, they might come back with an aol account instead of hotmail, but they would seldom keep that up for long.
What in particular is misleading about that sub? I have never viewed their monthly summary thing, rather I just see what posts and comments are removed in the various subs, and honestly wasn't able to spot any clear patterns pointing fingers back at one sub more strongly than the others. They all had some weird moderation decisions, though, but it appears that the majority of those were done by an automoderator which leads me to think it was some combination of account age/karma/keywords.

I am not sure concepts like branding or even traditional organization schemes mean much in the bitcoin world. It's not the bitcoin core brand that's important, it's that everyone is running the same underlying protocol, with no disagreements over the rules. I guess name recognition does mean something, but there's really no reason bitcoin core can't be renamed, and with enough dev turnover the team and "branding" could be entirely different years from now with no ill effects.
If people think that bitcoin should be taken in a particular direction, whether that is increased block sizes or whatever else, the best way for them to contribute is to the join the dev team that maintains the bitcoin core software. As long as they are prepared to deal with having their ideas reviewed by peers that may disagree. If they do not wish to do this, the next best thing for them is to create an altcoin and let users decide whether their product is better.
There is no room for conflicting implementations of the underlying bitcoin protocol UNLESS forked implementations are designed to create new altcoins.
Lucky for us, bitcoin is designed to enforce this situation, although it has not yet been tested against a rebellion by a mining majority. If it survives even that, we'll have a lot of reason to put faith in its long term ability to survive.

Giving said people the benefit of the doubt, perhaps they feel that even if not Satoshi's intention, hash rate is still the only objective way to measure community consensus for making rule changes.
Of course, I disagree, at which point they ask "well then, how do YOU measure community consensus"? I've been asked that question a few times. I've even tried to answer it, which never got me anywhere.
Then I realized, it's a leading question. It doesn't need an answer. You don't need any consensus at all to fork bitcoin. Just go ahead and do it. Whether your fork succeeds or not will depend on a myriad of individual decisions made by people, not code.

Assuming you are still in posession of the Mt Gox codebase, have you ever been able to determine *exactly* what happened to cause the loss of those bitcoins?
In recent years we've learnt they were probably stolen by a single individual (allegedly a guy named Alexander Vinnik) over a long period of time and sold on btc-e. But the question remains - how?
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:22:16
Non-mining nodes individually determine validity and among the valid chains (as they see it) pick the winner based on length.
They then peer with other nodes to create a p2p network without which bitcoin would not function.
Together, a multitude of individual decisions by operators as to what their nodes consider valid determines what bitcoin is. The role of hash rate is actually as a tie-breaker when there are multiple valid chains. Hash rate is not the first consideration, validity is.
@_date: 2018-04-23 12:55:04
I agree that bitcoin solved real problems, but it is able to do so because the content it works with is exceeding simple. Without any fancy AI, it is able to determine if a transaction is trying to double spend, if it's spending more than the inputs, etc.
You surely can build a decentralized community, of that I have no doubt, but I absolutely doubt its resilience to bad actors. It's not as simple as a ledger of account balances, so the system can't autonomously police itself as bitcoin does.


First, the group *isn't* telling *everyone else* what to do. The rules only apply to people who want to participate in the group. Don't like the rules? Find another group.
Second, this entire conversation started because people were spamming Monero sales pitches in here. If you have convinced yourself that these people are repressed or that they have anything to offer, you might be a bit confused.
Remember, this is It's not and it it's not Altcoin discussions are *usually* off-topic, and when they're nothing more than people trying to pump up their investment, they're worse than that. They're spam. I'd expect to get the same treatment if I recommended people invest in some penny stock I'd purchased on this forum. Not only is it very bad etiquette, it's off topic. That kind of content not only should be removed, but must be removed, for this community to be healthy.

Why do you consider that most likely? There are so many possible routes to compromise a system through its front end. Until you actually know what happened, both possibilities seem equally likely.
Edit: Wait, was MtGox running on a shared hosting or managed hosting plan? With something like that, you need to control your own server, at least a dedicated co-location setup. Although I appreciate you may have inherited a system that was already set up, and moving servers is a pain. If it was on a shared/managed plan, some of the blame may fall on the company responsible for managing it, but I don't think such companies should ever be trusted with financial services in the first place. So some of the blame would still fall on the person thinking it a good idea to use them. Of course, the lion's share of the blame falls on the thief.

I've noticed that reddit's armchair economists love to ignore this guy when discussing Bitcoin, since their main argument against bitcoin's utility is that inflation is mandatory for an economic system to encourage spending. Apparently an overly simplified GDP metric is the only thing that matters in life! Saving your money is bad!
I hope Bitcoin, or at least some other crypto, gets the chance to test this "inflation is necessary" claim at scale over a long duration. Then we'll see how it impacts actual quality of life. To be honest I'm not 100% sure it'll work! But it needs to be tried.

The drama was very public and made a real mess of things.

The risks posed by custodial exchange hot wallets are severe:
1. The exchange controls your bitcoins completely. When you want to transact with them, you require their permission, and depend on the availability of their service. You must also hope they don't steal your money or get targeted by a regulatory agency in a way that freezes your funds.
2. Because custodial exchanges often consolidate customer funds into smaller numbers of bitcoin addresses, "your" bitcoins are often indistinguishable from those of other custodial hot wallet customers. In other words, bitcoin no longer considers them yours. Individual account balances are tracked outside of Bitcoin's network. Bitcoin's own security measures no longer protect your account balance, and it can be entirely stolen from you without a single bitcoin transaction.
LN is quite a bit different and doesn't carry those same risks. You still control your private keys, and the blockchain retains full information about ownership of account balances. Although you technically require "permission" of third parties to route payments when you aren't directly connected to whoever you are transacting with, there are multiple possible routes and no single hub will be able to dictate terms. And at any time, disputes or doubts can be resolved without human arbitration by settling the transactions on the blockchain. Your need to trust third parties is exceedingly minimal, and the security of bitcoin's network is still in effect.
The risks posed by keeping a hot wallet running on your computer are not as severe as that of custodial hot wallets, but still exist. Malware can fairly easily send information about your private key and/or wallet file and password to third parties. Or inject scam bitcoin addresses into form fields, so you end up sending that money to the bad guy. These risks can be greatly reduced by being careful and using passable anti-malware software.
Hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger, or similar devices, should be able to generate and sign LN transactions, allowing you to keep your private keys behind a strongly firewalled connection. But compared to what people are used to (tapping debit/credit cards), this is still inconvenient. 
One can imagine this being simplified to an NFC card that just requires a "tap" to sign LN transactions. Not as secure as a Trezor, but much better than a typical hot wallet. You might still get robbed on-site (as with everything), but at least you'd no longer be open to the whole world trying to install malware on your personal computer.
In my opinion, tapping a card against a reader and walking away with $5 in groceries 2 seconds later is where bitcoin needs to go before mass adoption is possible, and LN is an important stepping stone to getting there. Nothing will ever be 100% secure, but the right balance between security and convenience seems well within reach.

Volunteerism can't do it.
A main reason bitcoin works is because it's secured by fees and very expensive hardware. These two things prevent spam, abuse, Sybil attacks, etc. The fees and expensive hardware are not deal-breakers because it's a financial network in the first place, incentivized that expensive hardware, and accepts payments for fees in its own internal currency. Another reason that bitcoin works is because it polices itself with very simple (relatively) scripts - everything that happens is a transaction with meaning that is fully understood by computer. For this reason, rules are enforced entirely by algorithm.
A forum, however, is a social network, not a financial one. The idea of requiring expensive hardware and fees to use a forum will be much more resisted than those same requirements on a financial network. Additionally, the "transactions" are content written by humans that can't (yet) be understood by machine, so rules can't be enforced by algorithm. This means you need moderators, and without a way to prevent Sybil attacks, even random selection of users can be Sybil attacked by creating many user accounts.
I don't believe a distributed forum *that runs well at full scale* is a solved problem. You can get systems to work using volunteerism... until they have 800k users all wanting to abuse it for their own profit.
Moderation by humans is the only method currently available to prevent an 800k-strong community from devolving into a giant mess. Smaller communities will have better luck, and maybe that's honestly what is called for. A larger number of smaller communities. In a way, that would be a form of decentralization, right?

People who promote altcoins on r/bitcoin are basically the internet equivalent of door-to-door salesmen in the best of cases. Surely you can understand the backlash against them?
This is a private venue, with rules that are enforced, rules you are expect to read and agree to before even posting here. *Relevant* discussion of alts, as opposed to opportunistic sales pitches, are usually tolerated. And if you prefer more of a mixing-pot, there are other communities that are more inclusive of the entire cryptocurrency industry, such as I think you should revisit how you make investment decisions. Judge the investment on its own technical merits, instead of focusing on the baggage carried by its enthusiast community. Not investing in bitcoin because you think some other crypto is more scalable - that makes sense. Not investing in bitcoin because some people made a fuss on Crazy.

You've either never actually taken a philosophy of science class, or have forgotten the lessons. These are required courses to get any advanced degree in science in my country. They teach us that the interpretation of data is a subjective activity and that science relies on placing trust in authorities, because it is impossible to test every result for yourself dating back to the beginning of science. You can only "stand on the shoulders of giants" if you don't have to replicate all their efforts. Trust. Credibility. These are part of science. Somewhat related to your original discussion, however, this trust is distributed - the peer review process *should* mean that at least three people, hopefully more, considered the methods and interpretation sound. Doesn't always work that way, though.

How many people use them? Provide a link.
This reddit has 800k *subscribers* plus a very large group of would-be spammers and scammers. You can link to some small community that's succeeding all you like, but a success story requires seeing what happens when the community is attacked in full-force. That, by that way, is what the rules are for. You ban and remove the attackers by force. Required to keep the community working. Just as bitcoin rejects invalid transactions. A community that doesn't enforce rules is simply not able to survive at scale.
So, yeah, we are talking about millions of people here. That's the size of this community and if you're advocating that it could work as a decentralized community, despite ignoring my explanation of why I disagree on technological grounds, then the burden of proof is on you.
You *did* read [the now-famous article]( linked to earlier on, right? You understand that this isn't just some random idea I'm making up?
The requirement of moderation, or call it "censorship" if you will, is why decentralization is difficult. Unlike bitcoin, the content isn't simple inputs and outputs of numbers that must add up. The rules of a forum for discussion are too complex to represent by algorithm, so you need people enforcing them. People who need to be chosen somehow. How do you propose they be chosen? When you have an answer, ask if it can be subject to a Sybil attack. It almost certainly can be, easily. 
This could all change, perhaps, with further improvements in AI research. You could put a computer in charge of removing spam and scam posts, but with current technology you will get false positives. How acceptable is that to you?

Credibility is important to science. It's why we trust some journals, but not others. It's why you must list funding sources. It's why your career is instantly destroyed the moment you get caught presenting fake data. Science tries to be as objective as possible, but the core message in modern philosophy of science discussions is that it is impossible to divorce science from the failings of the human mind. The way to separate the good from the bad is to demand evidence generated under compelling methods. Evidence I have asked for from you. Instead all I see is ideology steeped in moral superiority. An ideology I happen to agree with; a fact that I don't think you've noticed. I am not on this sub to troll. I'm here because I'm an actual adopter of bitcoin - and not just as a get-rich-quick investment. So I am not debating the ideology behind it. I am debating whether it has been successfully applied and stress-tested in an rather unrelated realm. A discussion forum is *very* different beast than a financial ledger.
I practice experimental science as a career. Ideologies and hypotheses and guesses masquerading as "theories" are a dime-a-dozen. People are good at generating ideas that seem plausible. These can be comfortable or convenient to believe. But they are not so different from faith until tested. When you are attempting to promote an ideological shift, the burden is on you to convince people.
Your inclination to declare my skepticism as unscientific is absurd. Skepticism is the foundation on which science rests. Were it not for that, charlatans and snake-oil salesmen would take over. I cannot accept the blind application of any ideology, no matter how seemingly great, without careful consideration. Just because a distributed consensus system works well for a financial ledger doesn't mean we can claim it is possible to apply the technology to every facet of life. We can certainly try, though (and should). But I am unconvinced a decentralized community can prevent decay by popularity. This is not the same as being convinced of the opposite. I'm open minded, but you've not presented a single shred of evidence to convince me.

I think a decentralized forum would be fantastic, actually.

At least it appears that many core devs are essentially volunteering their time to comment on the code. [It's already begun](
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:56:58
At the moment they still care about the block reward much moreso. This is why when they pre-mine a block, they broadcast an empty block. If the fees were so valuable to them, they'd wait for the last block to properly propagate so they could bundle transactions in the new one.
This may very well change years from now after several more halvings, if the value of bitcoin doesn't increase proportionately.
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:58:54
Yeah, I'd prefer that. Call me crazy but I think choice is a good thing.
In the COOP proposal, the activation system for both SegWit and the 2 MB hard fork is still coupled at 80%. The most likely way it would work out that SegWit activates but the HF doesn't if it those signatories to the compromise change their mind and signal only for SegWit.
If signatories to the agreement want to back out, they're going to do so anyway.

If you live in a country that isn't a corrupt cesspool, use a  exchange located in your country, and whose office and execs are based in your country. Should you have a problem, this makes it much easier to afford a legal battle. There is no single exchange which can be recommended to everyone. And you don't want to do that even if you could, because that's how you get Mt Gox 2.0.
If a national exchange does not offer the liquidity or currency pairs you want, or does not exist in the first place, then it's honestly time to second-guess what it is you plan to do.

Yeah I had a conversation with a big blocker yesterday. He had an expensive 75 Mbps internet connection and thought that we should have 300 MB blocks for Visa-level on-chain scaling.
He seemed to be blissfully unaware that the block size does not mean your full node only has to download said amount of data every 10 minutes. He forgot that it also has to upload that data. Many times. And do the same job with individual transactions that have yet to be packaged into blocks. When confronted with this he just said that it's fine if there are only handful of full nodes in first world countries.
We had a cordial discussion but obviously neither of us changed our minds.

In his article he actually is open to BIP 91 and an activation method compatible with the existing SegWit deployment.

Your comment arrived in my inbox along with [this one](
I smell a conspiracy.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:15:25
The agreement itself is light on details, but states that it is be based on [this proposal]( which looks like it couples with the existing deployment on bit 1, and uses a second bit in order to gauge support for the block size hard fork. This will allow miners to signal either for SegWit alone (set bit 1 only) or signal on both bits to support SegWit2MB.
A claim of over 80% of hashpower on board is not something to dismiss. That's not "the community", but there's also a lot of "economic nodes" that signed that agreement as well. So it does seem to be getting close to some sort of meaningful supermajority. The next few weeks will help decide as others state their support/lack thereof.
While I agree with you that it useful to maintain pressure with the UASF, essentially as a form of insurance, I also think this is the first somewhat promising compromise since the HK agreement. I am personally open to such a compromise so long as the HF details are not ridiculous. And while I'm neither a bitcoin developer or a miner or a service provider, I hope my opinion still means something, even if small.
I don't think it's useful to jump to conclusions are assume malice just yet. People being combative and making assumptions is no doubt a big part of why the community fractured in the first place. I expect that to happen, but I would hope bitcoin devs wouldn't encourage it by doing the same thing themselves.
Give peace a chance?
But prepare the nuclear option (UASF) just in case.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:11:01
The majority of mining hashpower is backing SegWit2x, along with a reasonable number of non-mining bitcoin business - exchanges and payment processing services.
Unless they miss their deadlines, it's happening. And I'm pretty sure they're going to try *very hard* to make their deadlines, because the whole point of them seems to be to prevent UASF. By activated SegWit before August 1st, UASF actually shuts down automatically.
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:17:07
Well, this time the agreement relies/would have relied on third party engineering. So at least they can't point their fingers at core and say "they refused to write the code!"
It sounds like at least some signatories are confused over what they actually signed, so...

@_date: 2017-05-23 22:22:56
I can't deny that the UASF is a very good insurance policy just in case. If the folks who wrote this agreement are smart they can lock in SegWit before August, avoid the UASF entirely, and worry about their hardfork after that.
As others have suggested, as long as we're hard forking, we might as well [make it worth it]( But that will take longer than the agreement's 6 month timeline. So I hope the signatories will allow themselves to be flexible when faced with technical realities.
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:08:32
That site uses "support" and "ready" in the following way:
- Support means you like the idea but *have not* yet upgraded
- Ready means you have upgraded
Hence, the moment you actually upgrade, you move from the "support" to the "ready" category.
So it's a bit ambiguous, sadly.
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:37:03
We don't have to "believe" it. Computer code is not a subjective thing and how it works is not open to debate.
1. Nodes decide what transactions are valid and pass them on to their peers, which includes miners.
2. Miners also decide what transactions are valid but mostly just get to exclude transactions, because if they include transactions the nodes consider invalid, their entire block will be considered invalid. Miners then create blocks containing their chosen transactions.
3. Nodes decide if the blocks are valid. If a block contains even one invalid transaction, the whole thing is DOA. If the header is weird and non-conforming, the block is DOA. If the hashes are wrong, the block is DOA. Etc etc. If a block is valid, nodes add it to the block chain and miners get paid a block reward + transaction fees. If invalid, the block is ignored by the network and the miner doesn't get paid, except perhaps on a split chain in which the block is considered valid by divergent nodes.
A nuance worth mentioning is that miners are also fully validating nodes. But because non-mining validating nodes are both numerous and economically important, the non-mining validating nodes are more active in the enforcement role. Their word is law. If miners deviate, their blocks will be orphaned by the network.

It would be a 2 MB non-witness increase, up from 1 MB, which would again double the effective block size beyond that enabled by SegWit alone. So what is that, effectively 5 MB?

I haven't seen the "future hard fork impossible" claim before. That one would be *way over the top*, to be sure, but I can see people without development experience believing it if it came from some upvoted redditor or any figure of remotely noteworthy authority. I would hope that the BU devs would set that record straight however, even though the claim does assist their narrative.
I've seen all the others in various forms, however. The thing about most of these claims is that they usually have a grain of truth that has been cruelly twisted into submission, or point out a possible conspiracy which is then assumed to exist. So they stand up to a casual glance if you're already predisposed to believing that sort of thing.
And cleverly disguised bullshit is not unique to It's present here as well, and in every other sub on reddit, and in every facet of day-to-day life.
If critical thinking was a mandatory class in public schools, the world would be a vastly better place.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:32:12
Is that the most realistic motive?
Here are the options as I see them. So put yourself in Jihan's shoes for a moment and pretend to consider these options:
- Stall scaling improvements to gain higher transaction fees until people get so fed up that the calls for UASF grow very strong. Short term gain, possibly risk of chain splits and loss of value for the network... could be bad a bad move in the long term.
- Try to placate people with a compromise and get a third party to develop a new implementation of bitcoin with a new team that hasn't completely rejected you. Market will probably rally due to perception of a solution. Block size will fill up almost instantly and LN will take a good long while to deploy, so transaction fees will stay strong. Even when LN deploys, they still need on-chain scaling - blocks will still be full. And the new dev team will have members that are on your side and who you can ask favors of. They might even have a lead dev who, unlike any bitcoin core dev, can actually whip the others into submission, speak on their behalf, and enforce promises made to you. 
This isn't entirely a serious post. I'm sure there are other options, and whatever Jihan's true motives are, there are going to be nuances to them. I personally think this situation is most likely a power grab, and that they really do hope their software is adopted. Jihan is also not the only party involved so it's not just his own motives steering this ship.

There's also confusion between BIP148 and BIP149. I know much less about how BIP149 works. Will have to read.
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:16:29
The question is easily answered when you realize that the difference between soft and hard fork has nothing at all to do with chain splits.
Soft forks are backwards compatible. The current UASF, however, makes the SegWit soft fork *temporarily* hard. The concerns about chain splits originate from that. Soft forks normally can't cause them.
The place for a hard fork is when it is *impossible* or *extremely undesirable* to write extra code to maintain backwards compatibility. Maintaining backwards compatibility requires added logic and layers in order to recognize both legacy and modern protocol/API communications. That has some overhead. But it is almost always worth it. In the future, when legacy Bitcoin nodes don't even exist, the code can be cleaned up without issue.
I don't do bitcoin dev, but the reasoning is the same for software that has a public API - a "soft fork" in bitcoin speak is just an API change that keeps methods available, even if deprecated. You'll see a lot of software like that out there, and for good reason. Eventually, said software abandons the deprecated methods when the user base no longer justifies keeping it around.

That's a bit difficult to believe but I'm open to being convinced. Mining pools surely have some pretty "powerful" nodes in terms of their economic influence over the network, right? And those third parties which provide APIs that other people use... they surely run nodes?
And if people just tend to use third party APIs, then doesn't that further concentrate economic influence into a smaller number of nodes?
I agree with your conclusion, of course. I think. Although to be fair I'm unsure if I understand it fully.

I hope that core can work with people to stay relevant. They have a huge amount of collective experience with bitcoin dev and that is NOT something you just throw away.

@_date: 2017-05-24 00:32:24
Well, miners have to signal in this case, because the activation mechanism for SegWit and the 2 MB hard fork is shared - the HF and SegWit activate simultaneously using exactly the same signalling mechanism and hash rate threshold.

If this compromise it what it takes, do it. But let the community have the last word.
Take BIP 102 and give it a suitably stringent activation mechanism that requires super-majority hash power. Just as SegWit. And release it.
Let the community decide and be done with it. And if it fails, fine. At least then we'll know that the community isn't ready for it yet.
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:19:46
SegWit isn't that crazy or convoluted, really. Storing the witness data in a separate place. It's very much like creating a new database table and ensuring that both tables are linked by foreign keys. Very common practice, except just extended to the blockchain, which is indeed a type of database.
Sure, it would have been slightly more polished had they made a hard fork version of SegWit (there were mumblings about that back in the day). But maintaining backwards compatibility at the expense of a tiny bit of hackiness is usually a good tradeoff. Just have to watch that this doesn't compound with future changes so much that it becomes a mess.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:00:25


I am not certain that coercion is taking place. I am merely saying that it's important (to me) to help rule it out.
As to how this could be a case of coercion, here we go down the rabbit hole. I must remind you that you can fit the people in charge of the majority of hash power into a public washroom stall. This is a small group of people yet with the SegWit activation system they were given the keys to the scaling debate. Similarly, BU gave them the activation keys for their proposal as well. In possession of both, they could resolve the debate at any time. Or stall the resolution for as long as they wanted. They chose to stall.
Maybe they just honestly disagree. EC or SegWit may not be the choice they want. 
But maybe what they really wanted was to stall for so long that people became desperate and willing to accept things they wouldn't have agreed to before. That's coercion. Their true motive may be the formation of a new bitcoin implementation by a new dev team with key personnel who are more closely allied to the miners.
Sure, it's a conspiracy theory, but it's being helped along by the deliberate incompatibility in the activation system.


Only on a per-node basis. If I run UASF, I can't force anyone else to do so. You telling me that I'm NOT free to run my choice of software on my (imaginary) node? I think we're quite free to "fork off" if we want to.
@_date: 2017-05-08 12:48:20
There's no other way to interpret the current activation system as far as I can tell - how would you interpret it? A 5% blocking minority IS easily achieved. Unless Bitmain changes their tune, it already has been achieved. It only differs from the sort of voting systems we're used to in the sense that you can get more votes by spending a bunch of money. The more money you spend, the more votes you get.
Whether or not the miners should be the voters... that's what we need to ask ourselves. I think they should certainly have a say in the matter. But at the moment, they're the only ones who do, while simultaneously having established far more centralization than I'm comfortable with. I think that's a problem.
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:06:08


80% hash rate means the only choice I have if I disagree with the compromise is a UASF or similar. Kind of the digital equivalent of holding a gun to my head, actually.
I'd feel better about that situation if 80% rash rate was at all a decent slice of the ecosystem, personnel wise. But no. It's like a handful of people. The problem isn't really what these folks are doing with this hash rate majority now that they have it. It's whatever the hell happened to let them amass it in the first place. It should not have been permitted, though I'm at a loss as to what could have been done.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:01:15
The agreement stated a 2-4 MB hard fork AFTER segwit. And, crucially, there was no promise of an actual hard fork. Just that the hard fork would be *recommended* for the core roadmap. 3 months after the implementation of SegWit.
[Here's the actual agreement](
The 2-4 MB hard fork recommendation has already been made. That means a BIP, some supporting words by the devs present at the roundtable, and leaving the rest to fate. Those devs can't push the hard fork out, it has to first be agreed to by the majority of core devs before being merged, have an activation method, and broad community support for it to be activated. It would be at least as lengthy and politically dramatic an ordeal as SegWit. If it had a 95% miner activated threshold, failure is a near certainty, because of how divisive this debate has become.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:47:04
They need a way to also signal support not just for SegWit, but for SegWit + the 2 MB hard fork.
It seems like their software will use both bits. So it will also help in signalling for the existing SegWit deployment, but not the other way around - in order to activate their hard fork, people must signal specifically for the combo.
As to why they don't just signal SegWit and make their 2 MB hard fork an entirely separate thing, it seems the explanation is that they wanted to also reduce the activation threshold for SegWit to 80%. I suspect as a bit of a carrot for the pro-SegWit crowd who views 95% as way too ambitious.
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:15:30
I'm not convinced core is the only competent bitcoin dev team that *can* exist. But at the moment, they are the only competent dev team that *does* exist.
So your first point, is not necessary truth. It is possible for other developers to be equally skilled.
What will make the software suck is that they're going to adhere to their charter no matter what, which includes a planned incompatibility with the existing SegWit deployment. No doubt to encourage hash power to stop signalling for SegWit alone, to remove all possibility that it will activate on its own via MASF.
It's not a compromise when you force people to accept it by taking the other MASF option off the table. All they're leaving is the UASF which some people (disclaimer: not me) feel is unreasonable.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:32:54
What doesn't matter is whether he wants it or not. What matters are his actions. A compromise means accepting something you don't want in exchange for something you do. So it stands to reason that there's a lot of people who didn't want SegWit, and others who didn't want a 2 MB HF, but they've decided that they will accept the one if it means also getting the other.
What matters is whether he will actually made good on his word - to hell with what he wants. And the answer is, we don't know yet. But this SegWit + 2 MB deal is something he's been a signatory to since the HK agreement. He's waffled a lot on how he feels about SegWit, but he's also been consistent in at least *saying* that he'd support a package deal.
I don't like how he acts. I don't like the control he has over the bitcoin ecosystem. But I've jumped to conclusions too many times already and come out looking the fool.
This time, we wait and see.
And run UASF just in case he backstabs us ;)

I have to admit it's possible, but I have a hard time seeing Bitmain ever change their mind on SegWit. If the allegations about asicboost are true I expect they'd go even further than they've already gone to oppose SegWit, right up to an including purposefully orchestrating a chain split. It may "only" be a 20% efficiency boost, but with thin margins to start with, the increase in net profit could be absolutely insane. Antonopoulos estimated up to 2000% net profit increase... of course we have to admit that this is an estimate, based on assumptions about business models and expenses, but still... people have committed major crimes for far less.

Well that's because the two sides here aren't even speaking the same language.
They are are only measuring the size of non-witness data and are conveniently ignoring the effective block size increase that SegWit brings in order to paint it as an ineffective scaling solution.
Meanwhile, you are doing exactly the same to paint a 2MB non-witness block size hardfork as having no effect.

I don't think the risks of doing all that as a hard fork are really on the same level as even the risk of a chain split, to be honest.
A hark fork guarantees, by definition, a total loss of backwards compatibility. For that reason alone, a lot of people will oppose it. The way to make a hard fork safe(r) is a miner activated supermajority. Like SegWit, the controversy of an "unnecessary" hard fork will nearly ensure it doesn't pass. I mean, maybe it's worth trying, mind you. I don't adopt the point of view that all hard forks are bad, but you'll have to make a pretty strong argument to convince some folks.
UASF is risky, and that is probably why core as a whole has not promoted it. It was proposed by a third party and just recently championed by a core dev, who reminds people that it's his own personal opinion. The main risk is the chain split scenario... which I don't think would be at all a disaster in the end. It'll be freaky at the time, though, until the dust settles.
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:19:56
Luke has explained before that this is something they hesitate to do. A UASF is a rebellion. Volunteer only. And it's up to the users to decide, rather than being pushed into it by core.

You'd still need to work with a limited selection of algorithms. You can make ASICs that can support multiple algorithms, especially those which share common steps.
ASICs will always be possible. There is literally no way to prevent them. Purpose-built hardware will always outperform general purpose CPUs. Litecoin just learned this the hard way. It's own ASIC-resistant POW algorithm is now handled by ASICs, made by Bitmain. At best you can make the algorithms so complex, requiring such a wide variety of computational steps, that a general purpose CPU is needed to do the task. But you'll still find a use case for an ASIC in there.

There is no code anywhere in bitcoin that can measure or enforce a requirement for unanimous approval before changes are made. Miner activated schemes ignore the majority of users, and UASF still depends on "economic nodes", which largely down-weights the influence of home users.
Nevertheless, I am confident that bitcoin can survive this. Backroom deals are not a problem because talk is cheap, and that's all they are. The people in that room can propose whatever they like, but it is still up to people outside of that room whether to forge ahead with the plan. That is just how it's going to work from now on. Bitcoin has become corporate and there's no going back.

The necessity and invention has already happened, at least in part, via the lightning network. At least, the ideas are there. Actual polished implementation is another matter entirely and could still take months to years. In the time between now and then, what are we to do? Although you can see a small blocksize increase as a cop out, it could really help - especially in conjunction with SegWit, which would add up to just over 5 MB, effectively, while LN development continues.
Litecoin gained a lot of attention a few weeks back because they adopted SegWit. Now, it's amazing easy to take a bitcoin service and turn it into a litecoin service. The reason nobody does so is because bitcoin still has the network effect.
Who is to say how much longer that will last, if bitcoin remains stuck where it is. Maybe it is destined only to ever be digital gold, but that's not the promise of bitcoin that I took interest in.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:08:49
Yes, I've read it, and it's been incorporated into a [fairly new BIP written by Calvin Rechner]( that I honestly think I would support, *even if* Jihan et al changed the 2 MB fork code to actually be effectively 4 MB as multiplicative with SegWit.
But for reasons I've stated in various posts I've written today, as must as I'd like them to use that BIP, I don't think they will.
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:06:24
I let my other post run off on me a bit. But just to address your last paragraph, I agree.
Hard forks have their place, and when they do, I will support them. Supporting the longest chain solves chain splits. We've had a chain split before, and that's exactly what happened. But I also think some bitcoin core devs would agree that sometimes hard forks have their place. "Bitcoin core" is not particularly united, not like a traditional dev team.
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:31:30
The miner-friendly mechanism is already in place - the one that gives them absolute authority whether to activate it or not. But giving miners that privileged wasn't good enough for them.
Even this 2 MB hard fork "compromise", which I think it could actually work quite well, is not even a compromise. Because, as others have pointed out, when debating soft fork vs hard fork, a compromise is not "do both". I don't know what you want to call that... mutually assured disappointment?
@_date: 2017-05-04 11:00:32
I think you got it backwards. Litecoin literally had the trigger half squeezed on a UASF, along with dev support. The miners called an *emergency roundtable* to prevent. They originally wanted to meet Lee in June, in China. But they caved and videoconferenced on very short notice. They were pissing their pants, man. Not that I think they cared about litecoin in the slightest. They didn't want Litecoin to be a high profile testbed for the UASF, possibly putting Bitcoin dev's fears to rest.
Vertcoin is not high profile enough to do the same.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:12:47
Well that's a bit ambitious. The devs would need to release BIP 102 with a signalling and activation mechanism similar to SegWit, and a period between locked-in status and active status to give stragglers time to upgrade.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:20:47
That would require some sort of interdisciplinary team. Maybe one day that'll happen.

@_date: 2017-05-23 23:08:08
It doesn't even require code yet. They got 80% hashrate? Start signalling. Get as close to that 95% as they can. And then even if they don't quite make it, UASF will be successful and uneventful.
After SegWit activates, watch. See how things like fees, spam, transaction volume, node bandwidth, etc change with the effective block size increase SegWit brings. Use that to decide whether a hard fork to a higher block size is a good idea. And, if it is, go to the hard fork wish list and include some other goodies in there so that the opportunity isn't wasted. That will take time. A year or two maybe.
But this is unlikely to be their choice method because it activates SegWit with no promise of following it with a HF. They not only want that promise, but they want it to be programmatically enforced which is why they are hoping for a conjoined activation system.
I still don't think the compromise is crap, but to be fair, with no code to speak of, it's pretty hard to judge it either way right now. The spirit of the compromise seems OK but the implementation could end up being absolute garbage for all we know.
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:59:34
It uses Luke's *actually 2 MB* hard fork. I don't think that's what they want, haha.
There's a reason they've started to call it SegWit2x instead of SegWit2MB.
I believe that idea is for the 2 MB hard fork to apply to the legacy blocks, but SegWit transactions would end up being up to 4 MB.
So it's not a 2 MB hard fork, it's a 2x hard fork - a doubling that stacks with SegWit.
That said it would be easy enough for them to modify the COOP proposal.

They didn't foresee the kind of miner centralization we have today.
Remember when, several years ago, Ghash.io had close to 50% of the hash rate, and people freaked out? Remember how the problem spontaneously solved itself?
That is becomes that pool was not *really* centralized. Its hash rate came from individual users all over the world who pointed their miners at them. When the community freaked out at the situation, people simply pointed their miners at the underdogs. Problem solved.
Fast forward to today. Antpool (Bitmain) has ["only" 17% of the hash rate]( Sounds not too terrible, right? But their hash rate doesn't come from tons of individuals all over the world. It comes from within their company, running on hardware that they make and get first dibs to.
In order to ensure that they can't solo veto changes forever, you have to make the BIP 9 activation threshold no higher than 80%. But that assumes they aren't actually multipool, with control of other pools, as is frequently alleged.
So BIP 9 started out with very good intentions. Greatly reduce the risk inherent in flag day activations by ensuring that there would be a huge majority of hash rate favoring the change once the flag day drops.
Unfortunately it paved the way for allowing powerful mining pools to become even more powerful. It's really unfortunate, because the other methods for activating changes are certainly more risky. But that's what we're left with, now.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:33:04
That seems to have become the typical outcome for UASF movements. It worked somewhat similarly for litecoin as well - the threat of UASF actually got the miners to make an emergency meeting with Charlie Lee where they hammered out an agreement.
People can be upset that the meeting itself was behind closed doors... or they can realize that they actually influenced the tone and agenda of that meeting via UASF. It's not direct participation, but it's something.
@_date: 2017-05-04 11:21:11
I agree, I was just nitpicking when it comes to how most people calculate market cap, which is based on the price set by the last successful market trade (with hopefully some averaging). 
Like I said, transaction volume is so much more telling.

Some of it anyway.


No... 84% of hash power. Big difference. The fact that there is a big difference is why people keep crying "centralization!" every few minutes.


For me, it would depend on what happened next. If SegWit2MB went through without a hitch and didn't lead to some sort of ruling development authority I'd accept that situation and remain a bitcoiner. I'm not actually opposed to SegWit2MB, as I've said before. Just the tactics being (currently) used to activate it.
And I wouldn't just sell all of my legacy coins to buy UASF coins unless I was reasonably confident in the decision. Because, after all, I would already have coins on both chains... that's a pretty safe position to stay in.
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:53:38


I don't know how you arrived at that conclusion. It would be difficult to get a census or representative survey of bitcoin holders. It's not like we signal our beliefs through our bitcoin addresses or anything like that.
Anyway, I'm a holder too, and I am at best a big block agnostic. Maybe not really the right word, but I couldn't think of another. Besides, it has religious overtones which I feel suits the task - much of what we're seeing here is indeed faith-based belief. My opinion is that if big blocks are necessary, we'll know soon after SegWit activation, and that will be the time to talk more about them. Contrary to beliefs at core devs are not closed to the idea of hard forks. It's just that a hard fork *only* to deploy a big block is a waste. There's a laundry list of things waiting for a hard fork, better to bundle things together because hard forks aren't going to get any easier as adoption increases.
SegWit first, we'll talk about big blocks later.

We might get to a point where some people can afford to opt-out of fiat currency, however. Arguably we're already there for people who live in the right places.

Okay, so, I'm imagining that you guys all use the github comments to discuss various BIPs, and if there are no serious objections, somebody offers to write the code, somebody offers to commit it, and then there's testing, presumably by running it on the testnet for a good long while.

Well, we already know that everyone is *not* on the same page and probably never will be. But I don't have a good answer to your question that would convince you, because it really just my own personal philosophy: I prefer to be given more bite-sized options rather than omnibus proposals. That way I can support only what I like instead of being forced to take all or nothing.
I am getting a very real sense that calling UASF supporters a "small group" is underestimating the situation. And they still have plenty more time to amass troops as well.

They've explained why it will ever at most be an option that's turned off by default. And I think it's a good explanation. A UASF is a rebellion, and one that needs to be led by the community, not by the devs. Even though they are in a position of expertise to better understand the consequences, UASF must be a decision made by each person or organization individually for it to be an honest movement.

Hmm, it's more like money IS the hashrate.
A sliding difficulty scale ensures this. The money doesn't follow hashrate, or the other way around. They're in fact two sides of the same coin.
If you notice bitcoin's hashrate steadily dropping, that's the time to get the hell out. For now, we're safe.

For UASF, how can we determine the "influence" our nodes have? Does it make any sense for those of us running RPIs behind shitty internet connections? Am I right in suspecting that the exchanges and wallet providers - the "economic nodes" - are really what the UASF will rely on?
Corporations are generally a bit risk averse. I'm not sure they'd adopt third party UASF proposals without some sort of collective effort. And humans are reactionary, so we can expect that sort of thing to only start happening once things get *much worse* than they currently are. I mean, fees are still somewhat acceptable if you're transferring large amounts of bitcoin.
But I really want to see SegWit and LN. I'm interesting in seeing what use cases emerge once your transactions don't take at least 10 minutes (or zero-conf and praying).

Yeah, the convenience factor is something I see as important (sometimes). Convenient information is more likely to be read. 
I don't usually find the time to educate myself on the finer details of bitcoin. It's not that I don't care, it's that there are too many other things competing for my very limited attention. And as long as I remain more or less ignorant on the details of how bitcoin works, how SegWit works, how UASF works, isn't abstaining from any sort of action really the only thing I can do that doesn't just defer to an authority figure?
Thankfully, I expect (hope?) that exchanges, miners, wallet providers - the "economic nodes" - are incentivized to understand the technology they're working with to keep their business/project afloat. But then folks tweet that they never bothered reading BIPs they fought against, and it makes me wonder...

Well he doesn't really deny signing it - he never answered that person's question about how he managed to sign it if he was absent.
In a different thread he said that in this day and age you don't have to be at a meeting in person. He also described it as more of a "pledge" than a "signature"... whatever that means.
And I guess he misunderstood what he was "pledging" to do, as well. I'm guessing he won't be the only one to misunderstand. Agreement seems like it will fall apart but maybe, just maybe, it has made the signatories more open to SegWit in general.
You know, sometimes I wonder if those folks, even still, do not understand that SegWit is a block size increase. The way they talk about hard forking to 2 MB without being clear if they mean non-witness data only, or serialized block size, or what to do with witness data caps if they change the non-witness cap... makes me think they're still thinking in pre-SegWit terms. I don't think they understand SegWit. At all.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:29:19

If you're not doing one of those three things, you aren't transacting bitcoin. And even the second... that's even questionable.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:25:36
Because activating SegWit doesn't programmatically enforce a simultaneously activation of a 2 MB hard fork.
They are using SegWit as a carrot to get their hard fork - offering us a lower activation threshold which they nearly gauruntee will pass if we accept their hard fork.
As my post history no doubt suggests, I'm finding it pretty damned tempting. But it's not up to me. Well, maybe a tiny bit it is, since I do own and use bitcoin and decide what software/wallets I run. But it's up to the entire community. So if I'm being naive, at least other people will temper that.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:53:07
Right. I think most of us can agree that this is reasonable. SegWit is a good start, although it's hard to imagine the 2 MB not filling up instantly. The effectively 4 MB plan of SegWit2MB (probably, we need to see the code to be sure) might actually be more robust until very good off-chain solutions come to light. And off-chain is kind of a misnomer, as solutions actually involving bitcoin are still on-chain in the end and will continue to increase demand for block space. People keep saying LN is ready, it's here, etc... but no. It will take a good long while for *actual services* to be built up around that.
What is unreasonable are the calls (very serious ones) over on for 100 MB+ block sizes, unbounded block sizes, freely scaling block sizes, etc.
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:41:41
Keep in mind that the real goal is to avoid a chain split in the first place by having overwhelming community consensus. Or rather, making it so transient that almost nobody notices it exists.
Some would even say the real goal is for UASF to be a nuclear deterrent that leads to signalling via the old MASF in the end.
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:18:29
If we're talking about favorites, I like BIP 104. It's a similar idea but scales like difficulty, to ensure that blocks are, on average, 75% full. However, it has risk as long as mining is centralized, as it would permit miners with high proportion of the hash rate to make the block size limit shift around a bit, just by deciding how full to make their blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:36:49
Agreed, but I am almost certain that would not represent what the hard fork crowd wants, which seems to be 2 MB serialized block size in the absence of SegWit which then multiplies further with SegWit should SegWit be activated.

Yes, I too read through Satoshi's old posts and, for a while, was convinced that getting rid of the block size limit and just letting the network go nuts was the way to go.
But that is deferring to an authority that has not said a word in 7 years. An authority that hasn't bothered to reaffirm or adjust those ideas since. Ideas *almost always* need revisiting once they meet the real world. Satoshi never really had that chance - he withdrew from participating in bitcoin long before the real world really had a chance to push back.
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:14:16
In this context, it *probably* means "2 MB for non-witness data".
It would seem entirely pointless to hard fork just to set 2 MB for the entire serialized block... which I think would actually *decrease the effective block size* that SegWit can permit.
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:59:16
You're mistaken to calls these "decisions" or thinking that people need permission to talk to each other.
Decisions are only made the moment a release + activation system is put out there, and they are made by miners and/or nodes depending on the release system.
You don't have to worry about Barry Silbert somehow being able to magically release a new version of bitcoin that 95% of hashpower magically signals for. Lots of people have to be involved in that process for it to happen.

We all depend on other people for expert advice. It is impossible to get by in life without doing this.
You know more about bitcoin than I do. You are better equipped to comment on the risks (which you have done). You are also better equipped to make a recommendation, which you *seem* to be doing, but guardedly.
I'd like to see core devs independently state their own personal support or lack thereof for BIP148, and explain their position. This would fall short of an actual recommendation but would help inform people. And oddly enough it would be nice to see a bit of healthy disagreement between core developers, as long as it stayed friendly.
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:11:06
I think that's asking a lot. Perhaps even asking for humanity to change its nature.
Like it or not, you (bitcoin core) are the official maintainers of bitcoin at the moment. Everyone else is fringe. Although bitcoin itself is trustless, the people who make it are NOT. That's why it has to be open source. But somebody still has to compile the binaries. I don't know how exchanges and wallet providers do things but for at home node operators, do you really expect us to select code, check it for flaws, and compile it? I *can* do that, but I won't. I have better things to do with my time. And in the few IT startups I've worked at, when deadlines are pressed, you cut corners even there.  Downloading the official binaries is a relative safe corner to cut.
If there is a choice to be made, you can't expect people to go way out of their way (including learning how to compile code) to make that choice. Help them along - give them a few compiled binaries and instruct them on the differences. It seems like a pretty obvious solution to me. You know you're already providing binaries, right? If you really believe what you say, maybe you should remove them...

Yes, I was thinking about that the other day. It's very possible.
If people think it's possible to build up majority support for BIP148 in just two months, then it should be done. But it's going to take a fairly large proportion of core devs coming out in support of it, I think. If that happens soon, then it may actually be a real possibility.

Given their time frame I don't imagine that making changes to SegWit in on the table. They're going to have a hard enough time just assembling the code for the HF and the activation mechanism and testing that.

It's hardly a legal ambiguity. "Recommend" is not a word whose meaning you can possible mistake for "we're actually going to do this".
They knew what they were agreeing to. They wrote the damn thing. And they probably knew it would fall apart. No doubt the few core devs at the meeting very frequently pointed out that they couldn't speak on behalf of the others. That's why they used the word "recommend". And why the miners probably left the meeting with plenty of lingering doubt.
By the way, they were asking for a hardfork, but if you read the detail, they didn't have any firm details. Something between 2 MB and 4 MB for non-witness data, plus other unspecified improvements based on SegWit, whatever the heck that means. Schnorr signatures?
As agreements go, it's a pretty crappy one. I'm no lawyer and you don't have to be a lawyer to see how it was probably doomed to fall apart.

It's still core's SegWit soft fork, so it definitely kills Asicboost.
Unless they go "surprise! we're re-writing SegWit!", in which case I would nope right out of there. But I highly doubt they plan to re-write SegWit in 6 months, and the proposal they linked to just uses the same SegWit we know.

Hard to say. Coin dance does some pretty good filtering, IIRC, to remove nodes run on things like AWS. Which is what the nodes in question are being run on.
Coin dance only shows about 6k nodes in total, while saltylemon was showing almost 10k UASF nodes.
From that it seems like they must have been new nodes. I can only guess that they were intended to sybil the node count in order to make UASF look bad. If they were run by a UASF supporter, it was a very misguided and ultimately harmful thing to do.
The UASF itself is not a Sybil attack. But as long as people keep fixating on the UASF node count, Sybil attacks against that metric CAN influence people's decisions about whether or not they also run a node.
What matters for the success of UASF is who runs the nodes and how economically important the nodes are. 10k nodes spun up on AWS will accomplish nothing in that regard.
At the moment, the best metric you can get on whether UASF will succeed is [via surveys of economically important bitcoin businesses]( That's a handy link to keep because it also dispels the myth that "nobody wants SegWit" (I've seen  it said - many times). The huge discrepancy between the opinion of the overall bitcoin economy on these issues when compared to miner signalling is the very reason UASF has become necessary.
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:35:18
You're on the right track.
Block weight can be roughly halved (given some assumptions about the types of transactions people use) to produce an estimate of the average block size. The block size increase hard fork doubles the block weight from 4 M to 8 M.
They don't seem to be changing the relative weights of witness/non-witness data. At least not yet. So in that case we're looking at ~ 3 to 5 MB blocks.
But the details of the hard fork are not set in stone... another reason people are rightfully a bit sketched out by the fact that it's likely to lock in before the technical details are even finalized. Yikes.

You're misinterpreting what's he's saying.
Read that as "risks *exclusive* to BIP148 nodes".
The risks for BIP148 nodes are the same as those listed under "risks for both ... nodes".
Luke is not always a competent wordsmith.
One company holding ~20% hash rate is centralization. It's pretty obvious. You might point to Ghash.io back in the day, which once had 50%, as being an excuse. It is not. Besides, Ghash.io's hash rate came from a multitidue of users. Antpool's hashrate is almost entirely internal, and likely obfuscated by being partly pointed towards other pools. It's a huge problem to have a corporation with that much power over bitcoin. Who the hell knows what their true hashrate is. You'd have to break into their company and count their miners to know for sure.
I won't pretend that core can do no wrong, and some of the devs frequently rub me the wrong way, but pay attention to how they communicate... they aren't a unified collective. They are barely even on the same page for many decisions and frequently disagree. That is good. That is decentralized development, even if we like to give the collective a single name.

I sure hope so. I seldom find myself coming to bat for corporations, especially not ones manned by the likes of Jihan. I hope I will not regret my willingness to give them the benefit of the doubt.
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:30:39
I think I'm starting to figure out Jihan's true motives. What follows is partly speculative, but consistent with everything I've seen happen.
You'll notice that Eric singles Jihan out. There are other miners signaling for EC, or not signaling at all, but Jihan's name comes up over and over. Jihan has been extremely abrasive and frequently irrational on the topic of bitcoin scaling. He changes his stance regularly and tweets out bizarrely ignorant comments daily. From this we can gather than he hasn’t been following the technical discussion around bitcoin scaling. Because he doesn't give two shits. It's all a show.
I believe the true motive of Jihan and Bitmain is to support the appointment of a centralized authority who will oversee bitcoin development. This is why he was initially friendly and aggregable towards Eric, until it became clear sometime later that Eric couldn't speak on behalf of core or single-handedly fulfil any promises made. Same with the HK agreement - the core devs present couldn't just make a promise, go home, and whip out a new release of bitcoin core. But that's what Bitmain wants. This is why they are supportive of BU, which has [centralized governance via an elected president]( This is why they are now in favor of the NY agreement, which allows the signatories to assemble their own development team.
To hell with that. Jihan and his supporters can make their own bitcoin client all they want. And no way in hell will I run it or support it. Never. The compromise is only a compromise if it retains decentralized development governance. If it does not, it is just a malicious fork. And the unfortunate thing is, people might go for it. People are getting desperate almost to the point of caving in to such demands. Jihan knows this. It's been to his benefit to prolong the stalemate right up to the breaking point.
To me, UASF is not really about SegWit at all. It's really about bitcoin governance. I don't know if UASF is the only way forward, but please help keep bitcoin development open, transparent, cooperative, and lacking in any ruling authority.

Thank you for the reply. I found the pastebin proposal light on technical details, and what was there seemed to conflict with prior statements by Barry Silbert about making it a two-part activation. Then commented on how a bit 4 signalling would conflict with the existing activation system. Hence why I feel the agreement needs to be clarified.
However, you've shown that the bit 4 signalling does not need to conflict. So, maybe there's still hope. I can see people are perhaps rightfully suspicious of these sorts of closed door meetings, but the way I see it... it's just people talking. Still, I'd prefer if such meetings were made "open" by broadcasting them in full over a streaming service and making VODs available after the fact. Bitcoin development is open and public - consensus making processes should be as well.

No matter the outcome there will always be at least one persistent valid chain. Fears about splits have a real, tangible basis, but it wouldn't be the apocalypse people think. Was a chain split an apocalypse for ETH? Hell no. It wouldn't be one for bitcoin either.
Worst case scenario which might sting a bit is if we UASF and find out that SegWit doesn't have the huge community consensus we think it does. But that seems unlikely, and besides, if you don't try, you are guaranteed to fail.
The fact that a ton of people want SegWit, and a ton of people want something else might even be a good argument for allowing the chain to split... on purpose.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:29:58
I agree, the devs only agreed to **recommend** a hard fork. There's an escape, though.


But the miners also said they would only impliment SegWit in production if the hard fork was actually **released**.


This lets both parties just sort of ignore the agreement like it never happened.
Happy cake day, by the way.
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:37:24
No, a soft fork cannot cause a split, because by definition it is backwards compatible.
The UASF itself is not a soft fork. Neither is it SegWit. It is a temporarily enforced hard fork not of SegWit, but of a version bit signalling requirement applied against blocks. If you don't signal on bit 1, you are not compliant with the UASF rules. But, the key word is *temporarily*. UASF turns off in November.

rbtc has been supportive of Craig Wright for a while. Not everyone, but enough that you'd run into people stating he is Satoshi as fact, and get downvoted for replying to the contrary.
Beyond this, the forum as a whole is a mix of various conspiracy theories, ranging from the plausible to the outright ludicrous. I always had the sense, even very early on, that bitcoin would attract preppers, tax evaders, and people with persecution complexes. Extreme libertarians with a generous dose of paranoia. And now I think this has fueled the creation of rbtc and its continued prosperity. It's not just the government persecuting them, now they see core as being in cahoots with the big bankers and government.
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:21:20
Yeah, keep listening to them. Things get a bit crazy. They're actually arguing for hard forks over soft forks on the basis that soft forks force changes on people.
But I don't think they understand that a soft fork doesn't magically change the network unless it's run by a ton of nodes and miners.
They seem like cool guys, though. They just need a stronger contrarian on their team to make the show less one-sided.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:12:27
Yup, needs to be on all the time. I don't recommend running a node on a machine you use for much of anything else.
There's good info here: 
That's for running a node in general. BIP148 is just slightly different node software, but the requirements will be the same.






Initial download of the blockchain is going to be about 115 GB.
Monthly bandwidth is likely to be around 200 GB upload/month and 20 GB download/month. If your internet plan doesn't allow this, you probably shouldn't attempt it.
Running a full node can be compared to seeding popular torrents 24/7. It uses a lot of upload data. If you share your internet connection, you may not end up being too popular with your roommates...

By developing an incompatible SegWit activation for a third party deployment that will happen with or without consensus support from core devs, he it as least temporarily wearing someone else's hat.
That's fine, though. Bitcoin core is a loose association of devs who are free to work on side projects as well, and we shouldn't mind when they do.
What's not sitting right with me is the whole "incompatible" thing. Even if it's not Garzik's idea, and he's just doing what he's been asked to do by whoever is doing the asking, it's a pretty transparent power grab that effectively forces the compromise onto the rest of us via all that mining power they have. That mining power is controlled by a fairly small group of people... 
I guess we can count our lucky stars that the agreement is otherwise reasonable. It could have been much worse - it could have involved changes to SegWit, and much large block size increases and/or EC. Technically, I am not opposed to SegWit + 2MB. But I remain rather unhappy with the activation system they're building.
I hope they will consider changing it so that it's fully compatible with the existing SegWit deployment. They'll have more support and resources if they do this, making their goal more realistic, and more collaborative. That'll be better for everyone.
@_date: 2017-05-04 13:13:31
Litecoin core already planned to maybe one day increase block size. And the "demand" they agreed to is ridiculously far in the future. Have you seen the size of litecoin blocks? Because of the 2.5 min block time, that's 4 times the throughput of bitcoin... yet litecoin has a tiny fraction of the adoption.
Litecoin pretty much just threw the miners a bone to sweeten the deal a bit.
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:30:17
I agree, but you have to remember that the devs at the meeting didn't promise to do anything more than make a recommendation to the rest of the core devs, and that's essentially what a BIP is. Also, BIPs go through a sort of peer review process in the mailing list before they even appear on GitHub, so the ones that are there have been seen and at least considered worth the time of editing and posting on GitHub.

Dev silence on this matter is beginning to deafen.
It doesn't make sense to just wait for SegWit to patch the problem, because god knows when SegWit will activate. It literally could be years still.
Maybe covert ASICBoost isn't actually being used, but it's very hard to know because that's the whole point of it. But there's a very good way to be sure... *write code to prevent it*.
Maybe devs are hoping a third party will do the work or something, so that it seems less political.

The worst case scenario is a persistent chain split, like what Ethereum currently has going on.
How to mitigate it: ensure that one of the two chains in a split event has a large majority of nodes and hash power working for it. The idea is that this would happen to the SegWit chain, of course.
Even if a chain split occurs, it can be rather short lived an uneventful so long as the nodes and miners gravitate strongly towards one chain or the other.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:23:39
This backdoor deal is signed by exactly the same folks that would have been absolutely necessary to support a UASF, and which you are happy to call "the community" in that context. That is what is meant by "economic nodes" and "economic consensus". These are the people who will decide the fate of the UASF as well. They have built their empires on the success of bitcoin. I don't think they are the enemy you think they are. Hard to imagine them not caring about the technology that is making them rich.

I hope you have better luck with your attempts to spread reason and civility than your predecessors.
I liked your article. And that's coming from a guy who is leaning towards the UASF side of things. I'd accept a compromise, though, as long as it still included soft fork SegWit.
The other part of the compromise could be a block size increase hard fork, but it might actually be worthwhile to bunch several planned improvements requiring a hard fork together, to reduce the future need for hard forks.
That of course would require plenty of testing and should be done after SegWit activation. Unfortunately that requires a promise be made, and for people to keep their word. I suspect that promises may not suffice.
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:10:56
A UASF is weird like that. It's doesn't replace the MASF - it works in conjunction with it. And whether it is successful is not a decision made by code. It's a decision made by people and organizations whose nodes are particularly important to the network - nodes that support heavily used services like exchanges and payment processors. If they don't run the UASF, it won't have enough of an effect to matter.
Starting on August 1st, UASF nodes will reject all non-SegWit blocks. Imagine if BitPay ran the UASF - after the flag day they would be blind to the non-SegWit subset of bitcoin. That would create enormous pressure to make sure your blocks could be seen by BitPay. And that is what is meant by "economic nodes". BitPay is one. Your RPI node is not.
UASF also has an end date. At midnight, November 15th 2017 it turns off. That is also the end date of the existing MASF deployment. So in effect, the UASF creates economic pressure to adopt SegWit during the MASF deployment period. It is still the MASF that will determine if SegWit actually activates permanently.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:22:13
Cool. I am very much happy at least for the SegWit half of the NYA.
Now I feel as if the debate is about to intensity over the hard fork half. I would prefer if the NYA folks would give it more time, and attempt to address as many technical concerns as possible, including an appropriately rigorous testing period.
Ugh, and there's also this BitcoinABC nonsense to think about as well. But I think my strategy there, at least for now, is going to be to ignore it entirely, haha.

Although to be fair, hovering somewhere around 50-80% with a trendline suggesting the problem would soon exist is still kind of reason to go "huh".

Edit: those data seem to be misleading, see response.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:27:26
2 years?
The software from the NY agreement is to be active before UASF. And if it isn't, then UASF will happen first. Either way - you'll likely get SegWit by August, or two bitcoins, one of which will have SegWit.
And if THAT all fails, the core devs plan to go with BIP 149 next, as made clear by the chat log that was posted today.
Ah, I see by your reply to that you are assuming that these different release systems have to wait until the previous expires. Good news everybody! They're all happening simultaneously. Well, 3 of them anyway... UASF, MASF SegWit, and SegWit2MB will all be competing come August. And in case I'm not being clear, I mean August of this year.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:47:51
I guess the only place I'd disagree is lumping SegWit (on its own) into the small blocker camp. Certainly, there are people who just want SegWit and no block size increases ever again, but you can see in the reaction to SegWit2MB that lots of people are open to the idea, although there is plenty of doubt about motives and such (I have some of my own, but it's lessening). I think the resistance to slightly larger blocks is lower now than it's been in a very long time.
Still, I'm worried that bitcoin is getting to this point a bit too late, and at this point any further delays could kill it. Well, not really kill it outright, but make it a hell of a lot less relevant
I feel like I should buy into alts as insurance, but which ones? Isn't Ethereum insanely centralized, with an undecided inflation schedules, and a plan to move to a PoS system that may or may not work? Then there's litecoin - which despite being much more scalable in theory, that's never actually been tested, and people don't really take litecoin too seriously. Well, more seriously than dogecoin, but less seriously than other offerings.

I may have gotten that idea from I don't really go there often but many folks there seem convinced that Greg is literally your boss.
The only kind of software development I've done is the kind where I'm either being told what to do by my boss, or am the only dev on an "open source" project which sits on GitHub stagnating for all time. So it's hard to envision that third option and easy to assume that somebody must be in charge.

I just noticed him doing the same here. I actually noticed his username after I criticized his statistics, and I was shocked. I knew he was a huge UASF promoter, but... he's claiming 60% community support. The only way that's possible is if he conveniently ignores segments of the community he doesn't like, which is of course entirely dishonest.
I respect and support almost all of the bitcoin core devs, but I have lost most of my respect for Luke. If he contributes good code, that's great, he should stay as a core dev. But as he's very prolific on social media, he's become a major public face of bitcoin core... and his questionable posts are doing them a disservice. The rest of the devs need to stage an intervention or something.
@_date: 2017-05-20 14:58:27
I haven't seen Luke say a UASF is guaranteed to win. Maybe I missed it. By stating that there are risks, which would be completely moot if he felt that success was certain, he is at least indirectly acknowledging that it is far from certain. He's in favor of it, of course, so he's going to promote it and can't do that if he's defeatist about it. So we can expect him to want people to believe it can work.
There's also an interesting bit of historical perspective we need here. a "UASF", which is just new terminology for a flag day, has been a method for activating changes to bitcoin since the beginning. The system being used by SegWit, [BIP 9]( is quite new. [Not implemented until 2016](
What we've seen, however, is a little bit of revisionist history by some folks, claiming that activating changes to bitcoin is actually the job of miners, and that it's unacceptable to do it any other way. But many different methods and variations of methods have been used to activate changes over bitcoin's history. Some much more risky than the current UASF, which at least has an end date to provide relief in the worst case scenario.
Some previous activations even lead to the same sorts of problems that the current UASF may cause. There is at least one chain split that already occurred in bitcoin, which [happened in 2013]( (interesting to note the author of that article, haha). So we're not venturing into unknown territory in terms of the risks.
BIP 9 is a good idea to prevent these issues, but it seems to have failed (at least at a 95% threshold), thanks to miner centralization. But at lower thresholds you start to undermine the entire point of it. For people who don't like SegWit, the current situation may seem like a success. But it's not... everyone should be disgusted by it. Individual mining corporations now hold enough mining power to be gatekeepers in the way of changes to the protocol via BIP 9 and similar mechanisms. Right now the mining centralization is working in favor of some people's personal opinions. It will be working against those same people at some point in the future.
So we have a problem, and by "we" I mean literally all of us. The only way around that problem that I can see is to go back to the old ways of doing things for now, until some literal genius can figure out a good way to make a robust activation system that does the same job of mitigating risk, while not being so easily gamed.
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:19:27


Everybody does. It's why there's another 2 week delay period after segwit activation "locks in" before it actually activates. During that time people are expected to rush around to actually upgrade their nodes. Happened with Litecoin - Greg Maxwell actually showed up and told Litecoin folks they better actually upgrade instead of just signal (and nobody knew who he was, they thought he was "concern trolling"). It worked out in the end.


They didn't agree to do so. They only agreed to *recommend it*.
The difficulty is that the core devs present at the roundtable were entirely unable to speak on behalf of bitcoin core. Bitcoin core has no leader, no spokesperson, and no consensus on block size. Hence the deadlock and why the agreement's language is suitably vague.
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:02:38
In the English language that I know, the word "recommendation" is not a synonym for "implementation".
If the agreement is so ambiguous that you and I can so fundamentally disagree over the same text, then it's a completely broken agreement in the first place.

It really doesn't matter whether an economic minority decides to boycott the miners. It won't be felt.

Are you suggesting they want EC so they can *decrease* the block size to make fees even higher? I mean, that would be some next-level plotting. So far they've been quite consistent in wanting a block size *increase*... but only if hard fork. In the olden days before SegWit deployed, they argued over whether 2 MB or 4 MB or 8 MB, but never 0.5 MB that I can recall.

I disagree. "Follow the longest chain" is the basis of bitcoin's consensus system. And miners decide which chain is the longest.
That system would work if hash rate was better distributed. Right now, bitcoin's consensus system is actually somewhat broken, IMO. First step in fixing it - stop pretending it's not broken.
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:22:53
We're only talking about the SegWit activation here, the possibility of a hard fork is still about 100 days away.
And in the current climate, IMO it's anybody's game. There's a lot of big promises to activate the hard fork, but... 100 days is long enough for many things to change.

It seems like a lot of people here, maybe the majority, fail to understand what daytraders do, and why they need to have their funds on an exchange 24/7. Like it or not, a good chunk of bitcoin "adoption" is this. Not really what it was meant for, but there it is.
Daytraders who don't want a repeat of this situation will need to use an exchange that complies with US regulations... even if said exchange is not located in the US. This is the world we live in, where the US polices the entire world through a variety of treaties that extend their laws outside of their borders.
However, btc-e may still exist. The .com domain may have been seized but as long as their servers have not, and if the operators put it back online, it will have a reachable IP address.
Remember, the guy who was arrested - he was an admin, but not the sole owner.
I have no horse in this race. My coins are offline and have been for years. But no good will come from blaming the victims. Telling daytraders to take their coins off of exchanges is telling them to stop using bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:11:35
I think people require information and very good reasons to go out of their way to do something, like a UASF, especially if there is perceived risk.
I don't think people have been given either of those things in any proper manner, and now there isn't time.

I am a core supporter (mostly), and very much pro-SegWit. Feel I should get that out of the way before I put my next statement out there, because it's fashionable to accuse people of being enemies these days. So I want you to know, I'm not an enemy.
Home users are not economic nodes. They *do* have influence, but not nearly as much as exchanges, payment processors, miners, and other nodes which relay and generate a disproportionate amount of the network's transactions and blocks. The balance of this power has nothing to do with block size. With pruning nodes and a non-shit internet connect you could run nodes with much higher block size caps. The balance of this power is entirely determined by the number of transactions and blocks your node relays and generates, the value of those transactions, and the extent to which they spread through the network.
When you read the phrase "economic consensus", be aware of what that means - it is consensus weighted by the economic importance of the nodes.
If your node vanishes from the bitcoin network, how many people will notice? That is how you determine the strength of your influence in the bitcoin network.
This agreement could have worked out had it been better planned and been given a more realistic time frame for the hard fork. To me, it doesn't show why blocks need to be small. Instead, it shows why agreements need to be made openly and iteratively over a time frame much longer than people's attention span over a conference call.

Jihan has been saying and doing things that should piss off literally everybody. His hardware has monopolized the bitcoin mining scene and his mining pool is the largest around. He frequently tweets out insults at people and behaves like a spoiled brat. His desire for more fee revenue is causing him to draw erroneous conclusions about BIPs before he even reads them, then just says "looks stupid" after he does. Not to mention all of the possibly nefarious things he's doing in regards to ASICBoost and that lovely killswitch code he had in his firmware for a while. His company patched the killswitch code, so good on them, but they haven't made a move to do anything about putting ASICBoost fears to rest. Interesting.
I try to give folks the benefit of the doubt, I really do, but they've been defending Jihan when it's consistent with their manifesto, and pretending nothing happened when Jihan says things that ought to make them furious. I'll let other people throw out the accusations and conspiracy theories, but bloody hell is it tempting to do so myself. Something's fucky.

Do you mean commit access?
Ask core devs about it. They'll say it's a duty, not a position of power. The devs are clearly not a coherent group - you can see this in how they behave. Greg Maxwell doesn't like BIP148. Luke Jr does. There are a ridiculous number of scaling-related BIP proposals. It's a bunch of people throwing ideas at each other and, for the most part, agreeing on precious few of them.
If they had a leader, it would go over very differently. Things would happen. But not necessarily good things.
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:01:42
Some days ago a [SegWit + 2 MB BIP]( was posted here that got a fair amount of attention - even Luke was not opposed to it, and he's a rather conservative guy (development wise; I have no idea about his political leanings). It is compatible with the existing segwit deployment.
That's a better way. But I don't think they'd ever go for it for two reasons:
- It was a strict 2 MB block size hard fork. By that I mean that legacy blocks could be 2 MB, while SegWit blocks size cap was unchanged. But the signatories don't actually want 2 MB. They want 2 MB for legacy blocks but 4 MB for SegWit blocks, while still calling it 2 MB so that it sounds more incremental.
- It's compatible with the existing SegWit deployment. This is the more important reason they won't go for it. They want people who want SegWIt badly enough to be drawn to their own bitcoin fork and stop running core's code.
It's all about establishing a central authority over bitcoin's development process. Or at least that's my hypothesis.
Edit: added link to BIP in question

Looks like it's a third party effort at this point.
If this happens, the true test will be if pull requests are merged into bitcoin core if the dust settles in favor of this compromise. If core devs accept changes activated by a third party despite core's initial misgivings, they will not only remain relevant, but will certainly gain a great deal more respect from me, and I would hope from many others as well.
I have to admit that I am a bit disheartened by Luke Jr's reaction to this. Maybe he's right about this being a tactic to stall UASF, but jumping to conclusions as he did could hugely undermine his credibility. It seems a bit unprofessional if yo ask me. I hope that other core devs are more netural in their reactions, but Luke, Peter, and Greg are currently the big three public faces of core, and all three of them seem to be highly alarmist people.
Maybe it *is* time for new blood in bitcoin development. I just hope the new blood isn't a bunch of wild west cowboys who don't adequately test their code before putting it out into the world. BU has been a disaster.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:43:11
"At the same time" is because they want programmatically enforced "If SegWit, then 2 MB HF". SegWit activation at 80% threshold is the carrot they're hoping the community takes, but the HF is what they really want, and it locks in at the same time as SegWit does in their proposal.
Lock-in and activation are different events. For example, SegWit locks in, but then doesn't activate for two weeks. That time is meant to give the community time to upgrade, which is good because a lot of people signal without actually running the SegWit-compatible software.
Similarly, a hard fork can be made to lock-in in response to a miner-activated threshold, but sit in dormancy for any chosen period of time to give the community a chance to upgrade before the actual activation.
It's a code-enforced compromise, so you have to buy the package deal or stick with the 95% activation and/or UASF.
I can understand why they want the simultaneous, unified lock-in mechanism, but it sounds like it's also going to kill the deal.

Oh I've been here a while. Sad to say that the last time I was equally bewildered by massive increases in price... very bad things happened shortly after. A two year long bear market followed the collapse of Gox, which many people now believe was the cause of the price increase - inability to withdraw fiat (sound familiar?) combined with Gox trying to cover their ass in loosing shit tons of coins by writing a bot to try to game the market. Well, that last thing is much more speculative than the first.
Well, at least now there is no one monolithic exchange, so that same situation probably can't happen quite the same way ever again.
But we could still be in for a bit of a bubble popping in the future. Depends entirely on what's causing the rise in price.

I'm following BIP148 (and 149) with interest, increased somewhat now that it seems this agreement is in fact falling apart.
Have any devs run simulations with BIP148 to quantify the results of different hypothetical scenarios? Is that even a worthwhile exercise?
Have any miners thrown in their explicit support?
What do you think it would take for even someone as stubborn as Jihan to signal SegWit unconditionally? Is the threat of UASF enough? He did so with Litecoin, but Bitcoin is in a much different economic position, and his reaction to the UASF has been rather different here in bitcoinland.
@_date: 2017-05-08 13:22:33
I think that's a bit naive.
Just because SegWit has overwhelming community support, that doesn't mean people are willing to do much more than share their enthusiasm for it. A UASF requires users to go out of their way to download new software, signal, etc. Call it apathy or laziness if you want... but there's also a technical hurdle to jump through. For businesses, there may also be perceived risk in fiddling with their nodes to adopt what is still a *third party* change. Signalling UASF isn't good enough because the signals are meaningless unless you're running the third party node software that knows what to do with them.
Greg Maxwell spoke out against the UASF (in its current form), and further down in this thread, you suggested that it will not be incorporated into bitcoin core. I understand the desire to remain neutral, but being neutral requires you to inform users and offer a choice on whether to download/install a node with/without UASF. At the moment, by not providing the option at the least, you are actually anti-UASF. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:04:58
It's a very well thought out article and it gave me a great deal of respect for the author.
But I don't think anyone should waver from the UASF. Not just yet.
The community has until August to come up with a good compromise and lock-in SegWit via the 95% MASF as part of that compromise. That will allow us to completely avoid UASF consequences.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:01:48
Missed step 6: If they manage to find a new nonce that works (solve the block) before they know what transactions are good to include, they package up the block and send it out. Because it's worth 12.5 BTC right now. If they wait, they could lose.
Note that they do lose out on the transaction fees by doing this.
This whole process is called pre-mining. Sometimes they just solve the block really quickly. You'll often see empty blocks appear very quickly after prior blocks - that's why.
Empty blocks that appear a long time after the previous, however, were kept empty for different reasons that are anybody's guess.

And the operator personally owning bitcoin has nothing to do with whether the node is used.

Is that true? I am under the impression (via Luke Jr's explanations) that his role along with others with commit access is that he is more of a custodian than a gatekeeper and that consensus must dictate his actions. Luke describes it as a "chore", not a position of power.
I realize Luke is a bit of a divisive character, however, but I trust him to have an understanding of how bitcoin development works. Some developers have appointed jobs but that doesn't mean they rule with an iron fist. Luke's job, for example, is in part to take BIPs from the mailing list and post them to Github. He does that job even for BIPs that he clearly dislikes.

F2Pool is signalling bit 1, but not 4. I just checked their latest block
You've obviously a bit mixed up about things. Here's the version field:
And in binary: B‭00100000000000000000000000000010‬
Bits are numbered starting on the right hand side, at 0. So bit 1 is set to "1". Bit 4 is set to "0". F2Pool is signalling bit 1 (BIP141) but not 4 (SegWit2x).
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:00:30
Pointing out a conflict of interest is kind of important.
The compromise would be to activate SegWit now, give it about 6-8 months to verify that the effectively larger blocksize doesn't have wierd economic impacts, and then carefully roll out a block size hard fork *along with other features in a hard fork* after that. *If needed and if relatively safe* (which takes time). I could get on board with that type of compromise.
What we got proposed to us instead is a simultaneous activation proposal, which gives precious little time for testing and deployment. Worse, it is not compatible with the current SegWit activation and, as such, will fracture the current pro-SegWit ecosystem such that activation will be delayed even moreso. It is a total non-starter and not a compromise in any way.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:08:39
Hmm, okay.
The impression I'm getting from you then is that there is probably still a fairly small number of economic powerhouse nodes who will have a disproportionate effect on a UASF outcome, but that it's also an oversimplification to state that "bitcoin business = economic node".
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:37:16
A UASF is nothing like a Sybil attack. The potential for a Sybil attack exists only in our efforts to measure the progress of the UASF by counting how many nodes are signalling it. I could fire up 100 RPi nodes and make it *seem* like UASF gained a lot of support. But none of those nodes will make a difference. The actual success of the UASF is not based on node counts. It's all about *who* is running those nodes.
Nodes which run the UASF will ignore non-SegWit blocks. It's a boycott. Boycotts are more successful when the people doing the boycotting were large consumers of the good or service. In the same way, for the UASF, everything hinges on existing, highly important nodes switching over. We're talking about "economic nodes" - ones which generate and relay a large proportion of Bitcoin's traffic. If, for example, a prominent exchange impliments the UASF, there will be a great reduction in the demand for non-SegWit blocks. Miners who produce non-SegWit blocks will be paid less. This will put economic pressure on them to switch to producing SegWit blocks.
The idea of nodes enforcing changes is a very old trick. "Flag days" were how many protocol improvements were implemented prior to BIP 34 (2012) and BIP 9 (2016), and consisted of nodes installing the new software and basically saying "this is happening in 6 months; deal with it". Then one day, someone realized it was a good idea to let miners decide in order to avoid chain splits. It *was* a good idea, because at the time, mining was highly decentralized.
It's becoming less and less of a good idea.

The whole patent aspect is a bit weird. The state of IP law in China is still in the Wild West. The fact that they don't care about patents nearly as much as the western world is supporting a thriving industry of reverse engineering patented ICs and making clones for next to nothing. Companies like Texas Instruments have fought (to no avail) to try to stop that.
There are a lot of mining pools not signalling SegWit. Some folks have suggested that they are all part of Bitmain's multipool. Or maybe other companies *do* use ASICBOOST. The thing about covert ASICBOOST is... well... it's covert. If done right, you'd suspect nothing.
Not signalling SegWit may be a tell, or it may not be. What's more telling is that Bitmain opposed a patch to prevent covert ASICBOOST on the grounds that they'd prefer that everybody use it. Of course pointing out they owned the patent in the same paragraph. You know what's that's about... they want licensing fees. Still, good luck enforcing that patent, haha.

SegWit2x was their idea, and every single thing they have done since the agreement has been completely consistent with their intention to uphold it.
I believe they will continue doing so because breaking the agreement would be a PR disaster for them. They don't have any convenient scapegoats this time, unlike with the HK agreement.

Yes, exactly. But you won't suddenly gain value, because the value of bitcoin will be split across the two chains.
ETH's split persisted because it was the entire point - some people literally wanted it to happen. But a split caused by a UASF will *probably* lead to one of the two chains being abandoned by the network.

The bit about spam attacks was very interesting. Actual evidence was presented to show that the mempool backlog was malicious, with an explanation of how the transactions were stuffed with signatures.
Although I'd hesitate to call that a smoking gun, it's definitely the first convincing evidence I've seen other than the mempool graph itself.
Schnorr signatures look great. The cynic in me suspects that special interest groups will find a way to spark yet another civil war over the idea, however.
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:16:09
The delay between now and lock-in, and the delay between lock-in and activation give ample time for miners to play naughty. And basically that would involve miners pulling out of the agreement at the last minute.

Not sure I follow. That poll question doesn't exist in the pool. But you might be able to do some poll algebra to get a very approximate answer.
There is a very important difference between "If the economic majority supports BIP148, I will support it too" and "I will *only* support BIP148 if the economic majority supports it".
Making good poll questions is hard. It's too easy to make questions vague or leading.
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:24:26
I'm making the point that they may very well want SegWit. But not the current UASF. They're waiting to see if it's safe and they're taking their cues from bitcoin core devs, who seem to disagree on that issue.
I known a chain split wouldn't be the end of the world, but if we can avoid it's let's do that. Two months isn't enough time to rally the entire community *the right way*. The right way being through informing them into a decision, instead of scaring them into one.
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:54:16
I'll concede on that point. You're right, it's important keep in mind the difference between release and activation.
Of course, all the devs present agreed to doing was to *recommend* that the hardfork code be included. Which they did.
So it's actually possible for the agreement to fall apart *without* anyone actually breaking their promise. That occurs when the recommendation  is made to the rest of the core devs, by the ones present at the meeting, but the result is that the hard fork code is never merged into bitcoin. And that's pretty much what happened.
So perhaps I shouldn't have said that Jihan violated the agreement. Perhaps it's more accurate to say that nobody did.
Unfortunately, Jihan has been very aggressive in his statements against core in recent months, so I don't see any hope in them seeing eye to eye any time soon.

How short was the notice for Ethereum?
I mean, "worked just fine"... yeah,  I guess. They did end up with two Ethereums, though. One happened to be a fairly small minority which is why it worked out. Had the group against the hard fork been larger, with the split closer to 50/50, it might have been a very different outcome.

SegWit signalling today is now above 70%, even before BIP91 has actually activated. Since that's a roughly 24 hour moving window (last 144 blocks), and the proportion of miners signalling has been increasing all day (BTC.com recently started), it's even higher on shorter time scales. When BIP91 actually activates it will be higher still.
While Peter Todd has a valid concern, I am personally very optimistic about SegWit lock-in during activation period 20.
BIP148 nodes are good insurance, of course. The risks associated with them (chain split, re-org, etc) are now mostly moot since miners are planning to do exactly the same kind of enforcement anyway.
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:56:20
You either set bit 4 or not. This makes it pretty much impossible to improperly signal for SegWit2x.
If you mean that they are signalling for it, but not running SegWit2x itself, then maybe. Did they say so? Either way, they're still signalling properly.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:30:17
Yeah, I get you.
But there are many less nefarious reasons people might stick to their guns on this one.
- They aren't (all) devs. And for non-devs, a block size increase hard fork is easier to fully understand than SegWit. It's just increasing a number - the most complex part is the activation system.
- They may be too proud to admit that they are wrong. Sounds silly, but I've been there myself... found myself arguing on even once I knew I was wrong. It's completely irrational, but that's humans for ya.
- They may feel persecuted by core devs and supporters, leading them to reject core's ideas purely out of spite
I'm sure psychologists could have a field day with why people believe the things they do. I am not impressed by Jihan, but I'm guessing that his reasons for insisting on a hard fork at all costs are largely emotional.
@_date: 2017-07-14 12:42:36
I think a better, possibly still high estimate is 40%.
I base this on Bitcoin Unlimited signalling, on the assumption that bitmain would have signalled for BU using all of its available hash power. If that assumption is true, then 40% seems like the upper bound.
The allegation being that they basically also control several other mining pools. I'm not sure proof has ever been presented, however.

Agreed, exchanges matter a shit-ton. But I would not want to make any bets regarding what they'll do here. I am just not sure.
One thing to keep in mind: SPV wallets automatically follow the longest chain and call it "bitcoin". From what nullc has told me (I think it was him), most exchanges don't even run full nodes and just use SPV!
@_date: 2017-07-12 12:28:37
Based on what I've been told, the actual problem was indeed unintentional. Because on one hand, SegWit2x nodes were insisting on the next block being &gt; 1 MB (that's the intentional part), but on the other hand, the way they were configured meant that they would refuse to generate one... even if the mempool were absolutely stuffed full.
Apparently the devs forgot to change the default configuration for SegWit2x nodes to actually allow the generation &gt; 1 MB blocks in the first place.
All things considered it's still not a horrible oversight. That's what testing is for... but I'll be damned surprised if it's the last oversight we experience.

Blame Satoshi. The block size cap was his doing, to prevent flooding.
[In this thread from 2010]( you can Satoshi's thinking in terms of how to deploy a block size increase: make it a flag date (sort of - based on block height) a very long time in advance so people see it coming. You can probably also see why Jeff Garzik ultimately took on the task - it's been a pet project of his since 2010.

If Jihan doesn't want SegWit, he's probably not going to run SegWit2x in the first place. It requires that SegWit activate before the hard fork can activate.
The SegWit which will activate prior to the hard fork is the normal, standard SegWit. If the plan really is to claim SegWit didn't work, then people should be on the lookout for DDoS and spam attacks against the network to begin the moment SegWit activates. This way they can say "look, SegWit made it worse!" and likely even be believed by enough people to get momentum for something else.

There's a mistake in the description of SegWit activation. It won't activate 2 weeks after BIP91 gets 80% hash rate. It'll take twice as long under ideal circumstances, possibly noticeably longer.
The reason is this:
1. BIP91 signalling periods are 2.3 days long, so that's how long it takes to "see" consensus even if 100% of miners started signalling for it right now. The end of this week at the earliest.
2. After at least an 80% majority is measured, there is a further 2.3 day delay before BIP91 activates. Monday of next week at the earliest.
3. If the activation of BIP91 perfectly matches up with the start of a BIP141 (SegWit) signalling period, then there will be 2 weeks of BIP141 (SegWit) signalling before lock-in. Second week of August at the earliest. If the timing doesn't work out, add another two week delay.
4. After BIP141 (SegWit) lock-in, there is another 2 week delay before actual activation. Fourth week of August at the earliest.
However, for the purposes of avoiding a chain split by the UASF, we only need to get to the end of step  before August 1st. That seems very likely.

Right now: Miners buying thousands of $1000+ ASIC miners, costing millions of dollars
With GPUs: miners buying tens of thousands of $300+ GPUs, costing millions of dollars, until the near future when memory is so cheap that they all go right back to ASICs.
Centralization comes naturally due to needing millions of dollars to get anything resembling a decent hashrate. Even if we're all CPU mining, what's the point in wasting an entire computer and electricity for a chance at winning a single block at some point in the next 1000 years? The big boys will have farms full of thousands of PCs to do the job. So with the exception of being a selfless act, running mining hardware at home doesn't make any sense. I'd rather just run a node.

Wang Chun is obviously having a laugh. When litecoin was going through SegWit activation, he described his opinion on SegWit as a quantum superposition, started tweeting randomly for and against it, and enabled and disabled SegWit signalling numerous times. I would describe him as... eccentric.

IMO if bitcoin remains around for many more years, this is going to happen with existing chip manufacturers. Hell, look what NVidia has been doing... that's not the same (those aren't ASICs), but you can see they want a piece of the pie.
It's not hard to imagine someone like Intel or NVidia manufacturing mining ASICs.
And what would be better is if the bare ASICs were then sold to many other third parties who had the job of populating them on boards, providing customer support, etc. This would further distribute the manufacturing. NVidia does this with their GPUs so the business model is there.
It certainly could happen.

To correct your statement, both BIP91 and SegWit2x activate via bit 4.
Bit 1 is used to activate SegWit/BIP141. Both BIP91 and SegWit2x are designed to activate SegWit/BIP141 using bit 1 *eventually*, but only once they themselves activate using bit 4.
Right now, people are celebrating the fact that "BIP91" (really the BIP91 component of SegWit2x) is looking extremely likely to activate in time to give us SegWit without a messy chain split.  This is just bit 4 signalling at the moment, but activation and enforcement of bit 1 signalling seems likely.
Sorry for the flurry of replies, and my occasionally harsh tone. [You know how it is](

Interesting precedent this sets. I am not particularly anti-government, but I do see a very important role for bitcoin (or maybe some future crypto) in enabling people to circumvent government abuse, such as asset seizure, hyperinflation, overtaxation, and the like. Obviously, if they take down unregulated exchanges and only permit ones that cooperate with government, that becomes impossible.
There is obviously a need for decentralized exchanges (I believe some exist, but lacking fiat on/offramps of course). If somebody ever figures out how to run a decentralized exchange *with* fiat on/offramps, that would be something... but is it even possible?

The entire cryptocurrency market is in a bear market right now. Bitcoin and ether and litecoin and the works. Their price charts are so similar you could almost confuse them for each other. 
Daytraders and swing traders don't usually make market decisions based on the kinds of technical details you're discussing. Instead, they based their decisions either on technical analyses of the price and volume, or on gut feelings. And that's it.

I disagree that what core cares about is "power". They care about maintaining a very strict, extremely conservative development process that requires a much greater degree of peer review and consensus than some other people want. And it's understandable to some extent - their procedures make core move at a snail's pace.
The btc1 group can be characterized as a power grab in the sense that the participants don't want to be beholden to core's high standards. The technical requirements of SegWit2x were dictated by business people and set in stone with few allowances for alteration. This concerns me. Although it's the norm that IT departments in corporations are told what to do by often unskilled managers, that's not how bitcoin should be run.

North America's legal system is glacial as well, but perhaps in a different way. 
Basically you can go immediately to trial if you want, but you can also remain in jail/pay bail and spend some time preparing your defense, which can take years. The time you spend in custody prior to trial is then usually "time served" when sentencing is handed down. If you're guilty, it's a great deal. If you're innocent, it sucks balls.
I understand the Japanese system basically puts things to trial only when they're already quite sure the defendant is guilty. Might have taken years for them to get there.
There's something fishy about Karpeles. He claimed the entire hack was due to transaction malleability exploits, which was pretty suspect right off the bat since no technical details were ever released. I knew that the 200k bitcoins were found but I had no idea it was third parties that found them, after which Karpeles admitted to their existence.

Even though you are technically correct, that website is filtering out short chain splits that get re-orged. It's only watching for larger events.
Nodes occasionally do extend the blockchain with blocks that miners soon orphan. And that probably would happen for many nodes that see non-SegWit signalling blocks. So you're right, the enforcement of BIP91 should cause very temporary chain splits and re-orgs.
But bitcoin already experiences such events fairly often, even with everybody running exactly the same protocol and not orphaning anything. These temporary splits are just a block or two long and are caused by latency - multiple miners can mine the same block without having time to communicate with each other, and it takes a block or two for the global network to decide which of the two blocks to keep. This is a known property of the system and why it's recommended that sellers wait for 6 confirmations before truly counting on the immutability of a transaction. The website I linked to ignores these small events by filtering them out:


So don't use that website to watch for orphaned blocks. I only provided it as a way to watch for lengthier chain splits.
Of course with literally all miners that I know of signalling segwit, they could all be enforcing yet still not orphan any blocks for a long time. Some random miner is likely to throw a non-signalling block in there at some point, but who knows if anyone will notice. Once orphaned it can literally be wiped from the records of existence.

*Maybe* there is a disconnect. We have no way of knowing unless a chain split occurs, in which case we will know that not enough miners were enforcing to prevent it.

It depends entirely on what the dev process is for the BTC1 repo.
Core's dev process is to see commit "privilege" as a responsibility - if your code passes muster by your peers and there's a desire for it, someone in charge of committing is *expected* to merge your code. If BTC1's dev process is the same, then nothing really changes apart from the URL.
But of course the entire reason BTC1 exists is because *their* code didn't pass muster, so I would expect the core devs to resist merging BTC1 code on that basis, but also to resist moving over to BTC1...
So if the SegWit2x hard fork does succeed, I do think we're looking at a shuffling of the dev team, for sure. And a war over which of the bitcoins is the real bitcoin. It might get a bit ugly.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:59:52
Yes, that could happen, although it would require almost all of the fence sitters to adopt a position, and would require some signatories to the agreement to back out and signal SegWit only.

I just watched his talk for the Future of Bitcoin conference. He spent an hour and a half alternating between insulting the intelligence of his audience and throwing around technical mumbo jumbo with equally mumbo-jumbo slides. His presentation was a disaster, and the only time the audience reacts to anything is in the very few instances in which he actually says something concrete.
I guess it's possible that he has absolutely shitty public speaking and presentation skills, but he was not convincing in the slightest.
Anyway, he made a bold claim: he's going to have at least 20% of the network's hash power "very soon", and intends to run his own node software which will reject SegWit transactions. This is actually something he can probably actually deliver on.

This makes no sense. For the HF to activate on testnet, does it not need the same 80% mining support needed when it goes live? If not, then they aren't even testing it properly. If yes, then why can't this 80% mining support generate a valid block by their own rules?
You described the situation as "working as intended" further up. Surely that can't be right. Intended would be if a &gt; 1 MB block was mined very soon after activation. If they honestly expect to sit around and wait for &gt; 24 hours before this eventually happens, then that's just silly.

Wait, it just occurred to me that you might have meant "chain split" when you asked about the hard fork. A lot of folks are using the terms interchangeably, even though they shouldn't.
If that is your question, then BIP91 absolutely will avoid a chain split, unless something unexpected happens. Nothing is certain, but it looks very likely that BIP91 will activate in time to prevent a chain split.
Think of BIP91 as basically a bunch of miners joining the UASF movement. Almost all of them, actually. That's not perfectly accurate, but close enough to give you the idea.

I'm a software developer (used to be professional, now just a hobby). My concerns about the politics aside, I see a kind of big problem with their plan.
The timeframe coupled with the inflexibility of their goals. It's far too tight of a timeline, and they clearly state there will be no deviations from the essentially set-in-stone technical plan. What if the activation system causes problems and the conflict with the existing SegWit deployment turns out to be too dangerous? No deviations even then?
In corporate dev we would usually pad our estimates by quite a bit, and even then we'd often be working late nights. Corporations tend to have strong leadership, with teams working together in the same building. These guys expect to do better than that with a team of devs scattered across the world. The overhead from coordinating those people will slow down the process. And judging by the e-mail, the team - if it's even selected yet - is literally just now running through orientation.
They're giving themselves 2 weeks for testing to take it from an alpha to a beta. And another two weeks from beta to final. I don't know... that falls into "probably OK" territory for a highly experienced dev team in a corporate environment that's already familiar with the action plan. So in this situation, I'd say it's way too ambitious.
Maybe the stars will align and they'll pull off something that works flawlessly. More likely, though, they'll either have to push that timeline significantly to test properly, or put the code out there and cross their fingers. Let's hope they don't do the latter, because it could cause a chain split if done incorrectly. Hell, with UASF thrown in the works we could end up with *three* chains. Imagine that, lol.
At least they have the benefit in that most of the code is written already by one dev or another. You'd think it's just a cut+paste job then, but nothing is quite that simple - code that works perfectly on its own can interact with other code in unexpected ways.
They state their commitment to open development and safety, which is great, but only time will tell just how open and safe they really are. I wish them the best of luck, they're damned well going to need it.
UASF must go on, assuming that the SegWit2MB will be a disaster. As risky as UASF may be, SegWit2MB may be riskier still.

Heed that phrase well, because it's gold.
There is no such thing as a simple change to bitcoin, because of the existence of multiple interacting client implementations. Doesn't matter if you only change 1 line - the interactions between that change and the rest of the network can be highly contingent on exactly how the change is rolled out, which you seldom have control over. Users update on their schedule, not yours.
Looks like there is a fix in this case, requiring miners supporting BIP91 to specifically connect to their peers.
Still, this was caught by a dev not directly involved in the project... and not by those who were. Not a good sign.

It's actually a constant in the code (and gets used for a few validation checks), and described in BIP141 as being used to calculate block weight. But the devs didn't rely on it as much as BIP141 describes, so it's only used in a few places, and redundant even then.
Future "block size" increase will increase the block weight. That has exactly the same effect as increase "base block size".

No, this is SegWit2x signalling. SegWit2x starts with bit 4 which activates its payload. That payload includes two things: a hard fork which will activate in 90 days, and signalling and enforcement of signalling on bit 1, which will happen after the lock-in period (a few days after bit 4 signalling passes the necessary 80% threshold).
The miners now signalling via bit 4 have made their support of SegWit2x clear for a long time with a "NYA" string. There is no way to misinterpret the current situation as being support for BIP91 but NOT for SegWit2x. BIP91 is part of SegWit2x, but altered with a shared activation of a hard fork, to the point where it's not BIP91 anymore.

I am actually pretty sure that covert ASICBoost can work perfectly fine with full blocks. Discovering that this is possible was part of the information dump leading up to the whole scandal breaking in the first place.
[This blog post]( describes the high level details of how to perform covert ASICBoost. As you can see, all it requires is re-ordering transactions or specifically picking and choosing which transactions to the include in the block. It need not be empty.
The real problems with *covert* ASICBoost are:
- Further centralization pressure via suing competitors that use it. You don't have to win to lawsuit, you just have to increase their expenses to negatively impact their business.
- Incentivizes miners to block changes which alter the block header structure in ways that are not compatible with *covert* ASICBoost.
Nobody gives two shits about *overt* ASICBoost, and nobody is known to be using it, either. It does not have the same negative incentives.

The hard fork is included. It will lock-in at the same time SegWit does and will remain dormant for about 3 months, after which it will activate. This is assuming node operators don't abandon SegWit2x in the meantime.
The hard fork will probably be a very adversarial situation. Most core devs who have spoken on the topic seem like they have no intention of working with SegWit2x, so we could be looking at the breakup of bitcoin core. I only hope that whatever emerges next is still highly inclusive, with distributed authority. I don't hate Jeff Garzik, but I don't want him as some sort of "lead developer", either.
If this happens, hopefully it is remembered as a "necessary" evil, and does not become the standard technique for activating controversial changes.
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:17:46
Keep in mind that adding more means even more testing. But the real cause for wanting a long warning period is so that you can deploy it as a flag-day, and be fairly sure that by the time it rolls around, a large proportion of even the laziest of end users have updated their software.
I don't think SPV clients need to update if it's just a block size increase, since SPV clients do fairly limited validation. But people running full nodes would need to update... or intentionally resist doing so. But at least give both parties time to make their move.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:14:44
Well we already can see by [statements of support]( that SegWit has majority support among service providers, but [minority mining support]( And while UASF has more "yea" than "nay" votes, support is still low.
So it's not so clear cut. SegWit and UASF are different things and some folks in favor of SegWit are not in favor of UASF.
But if UASF fails, it will be no doubt be interpreted as a failure of SegWit itself. IMO that's the biggest risk. Not a chain split or any of that, but the social and political fallout of a failure.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:26:35
Jeff Garzik keeps resisting BIP91, and states why - to ensure that SegWit and 2 MB HF is a package deal. But since BIP91 doesn't preclude a shared activation system that would link the two, this makes it pretty clear that what they really mean to do is enforce the "all or nothing" deal on the community as a whole. They've got enough hash power on board to make it literally impossible to successfully signal for SegWit alone via MASF.
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:01:34
Some good points there.
But the problem remains: you can't prevent ASICs. A PoW change is a temporary reprieve.
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:05:03
Because it integrates with the current MASF which requires a 95% threshold.
It is not a standalone solution, but a modification to the existing soft fork.


BIP 9, the current miner activated system for activating changes, was released in 2016. Before that was BIP 34, also a miner-activated system, which was released in 2012. And before that, changes were activated using flag days.
Flag days are best described as "this is happening, deal with it". So as you can see, giving miners some sort of direct decision making power in this process is a change that was made several years after bitcoin came into existence. For very good reasons, mind you - it *greatly* reduces the risk of a chain split when you have reason to believe that a super-majority of miners are going to be making blocks which conform to the new feature set.
But that's falling apart.
The centralization that mining corporations now have, particularly those whose hash power comes entirely from within their own infrastructure, means that miner-activated mechanisms facilitate further centralization. A single mining corporation now has veto authority over changes proposed using BIP 9 at anything more than an 90% threshold. Sure, you can reduce the mining threshold, but then you begin to undermine the entire point of requiring one.
Going back to flag days, which is essentially what the UASF is, may be the only solution right now.

Worth pointing out that in the same thread where Satoshi recommended a flag day block size increase, he shoots down Jeff Garzik for not having adequate lead time (zero) in his proposal. This reaffirms that the amount of warning we get to upgrade before the change drops is very important. And with the network being larger and more valuable than it was in 2010, I would expect Satoshi to recommend even longer delays between release and the flag day.
It's also worth noting that in the time since Satoshi was active in bitcoin, alternative scaling solutions have been proposed which do some combination of reducing overhead in the blockchain to allowing multiple transactions to be aggregated into a small number of transactions. It's not clear what Satoshi would think about all that.
So unless he shows up in some provable capacity and contributes to the current discussion, I don't know if it's worth dredging up 7 year old posts which were made under very different circumstances.
And if he did show up, the strength of appeal to authority would make him a literal ruler of bitcoin. Even knowing this risk, I still find myself giving in, and wishing he were here, knowing that he could probably end much of this "civil war" with a single, digitally signed post.
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:04:47
First, the take home message. All this support for BIP91/SegWit2x/whatever you want to call it looks nearly certain to lead to SegWit lock-in by early August, and activation 2 weeks later. By mid to late August, we're very likely to have SegWit, and at least some modicum of long-term scaling options. Horray!
Now the details.
BIP91 is a way of activating SegWit that makes it not only easier to do so, but which has achieved a great deal of miner support thanks to SegWit2x (which uses BIP91). However, even people who do not support SegWit2x are coming on board, as it's the best bet for activating SegWit around right now, and it works in tandem with the UASF/BIP148 which you might have heard of.
But BIP91 doesn't activate SegWit directly, and BIP91 is also tangled up with SegWit2x, which makes things a bit hard to follow. So I will oversimplify, but it's basically this:
1. To support BIP91, miners set bit 4 of the version string for every block they mine.
2. The proportion of blocks with bit 4 set is counted over a period of 336 blocks (about 2.3 days). If it achieves 80% support, proceed to step 3.
3. Wait another 2.3 days. This is the "lock in" phase. Its purpose is to give everyone time to make sure they're actually running BIP91/SegWit2x/whatever.
4. After the lock-in period, BIP91 activates.
5. The activation of BIP91 turns on support for SegWit/BIP141, which is done in two ways: signalling using bit 1, and rejecting other people's blocks if they don't also signal support for SegWit using bit 1.
6. By rejecting blocks that aren't signalling bit 1, you create a subset of the network that actually has 100% SegWit support. This is also how the UASF works, so any UASF nodes will further enforce this situation.
7. With 100% SegWit support - literally every single block signalling on bit 1 - SegWit will lock-in two weeks after BIP91 activates, and another two weeks later, SegWit will properly activate.
8. Since you just got &gt; 80% of hash power signalling on bit 4 (see step 2 above), that means you also locked in SegWit2x... and the hard fork to a larger block size. The drama is going to be intense. Prepare your butts. But at least the argument over SegWit will be (mostly) in the past.

Nice, have fun! I've never been to a defense that didn't end in success, although I did go to one where the outcome was "pass with major revisions" and I heard through the gravevine of a student whose external figured out the data was faked (and caused a huge amount of drama in the department).

Your OS is unlikely to be the culprit. Your browser is parsing escape sequences that mine isn't. Are you using chromium or midori or something like that?

There will undoubtedly be resistance to the hard fork, but I have no idea what form it will take.
The technicalities are different because it's a hard fork. Hard forks, by their very nature, cause a chain split. That is a guarantee. This means that the fight over the hard fork will probably continue in earnest well after it's actually activated, and will depend on the extent to which one chain or the other is utilized, and the extent to which people value the bitcoins on those chains.
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:32:58
There's sure a lot of people in here calling this FUD. Except that the risks are real. Sure, *maybe* SegWit2x will activate before then. Or *maybe* BIP148 will be a complete non-event (or amazing success case). Maybe everything will go splendidly. Hell, some might say that things *probably will* go reasonably well.
But if they don't issue a warning, and things *don't* go well, they're going to get accused of a lot worse than FUD. Issuing this warning is a responsible thing to do. Maybe they could have made it sound less like a bitcoin doomsday, but to people who don't give a shit about the technical details, and end up losing money, that might as well be what it is.
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:16:05
I have a funny feeling that core devs will transition away from miner activated soft forks entirely, to miner accelerated soft forks like we can see in [BIP149](
Either that, or they will explore activation options that are more inclusive of both miners and economic nodes. A sort of "community activated soft fork" system that merges ideas from user activated soft forks and miner activated soft forks.
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:12:53
They're talking about a proposed 8 MB hard fork (minus SegWit) on BitcoinABC that may roll out by August 1st. It remains to be seen who will run it.
Hell, it remains to be seen who is even writing the code, because the GitHub repo has made the membership list private.
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:11:26
I'm only speaking of the opt-in RBF that was released by the core dev team. If miners decide to implement their own full RBF dishonestly, that's a rather different situation.
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:53:28
If there are no miners to do step 2, how did it activate? It supposedly needed 80% hash power signalling on bit 4 to activate. Did the testnet testing just conveniently skip all the signalling? Or were the miners just "fake signalling" with the core client?
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:37:40
That certainly seems to be the strategy of most folks here, which is perhaps underlying why everyone is calling it "BIP91" all of a sudden, even though almost all of the miners signalling via bit 4 are actually signalling for the SegWit2x omnibus, and not BIP91 on its own.
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:08:03
Consider that it provides incentives for miners to block any changes to the block header that impinge on its use.
Consider that SegWit did so, even though its goal was never to block ASICBoost.
ASICBoost is a workaround to a hashing algorithm that was supposed to have a predictable difficulty. Due to the existence of ASICBoost, miners can actually influence the difficulty, and we don't know if they are doing so.
It was never supposed to be possible, yet any miners who have come to use it have a financial interest in ensuring it remains possible, even though that means blocking certain types of changes to bitcoin.
You don't see a problem with that?
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:04:51
It was unclear to me at first what they were talking about. This is about BitcoinABC. Admittedly, I have not read much about it except to understand that it uses a form of emergent consensus. On the face of it I am OK with that idea. However... the "about UAHF" link on BitcoinABC's webpage takes me to Bitmain's blog. It's pretty clear that this represents centralized development authority by a party who already has a monopoly over ASIC production and a majority stake in mining hash rate. BitcoinABC needs to avoided like a plague.
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:55:54
You think the miners care about those technicalities? Blocks signaling over bit 4 exceeded 80%, and most miners have added "NYA" to their coinbase comment to make their intentions clear. The 2x hard fork is being done as a miner activated hard fork so their intentions are all that matter, even if the signaling was fake.
Bit 4 signaling was * supposed * to happen first, without bit 1 or witness commitments. So that's not evidence of fake signaling. That's exactly how it was intended to go down.
That being said, I am of the opinion that the 2x fork should not activate unless it has broad community support and a more generous testing and deployment schedule.
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:20:15
The top bar, "BIP91 lock-in", is giving you a count of blocks supporting BIP91/SegWit2x over the last 336 blocks (the activation window).
The next one down one, "BIP91" is the proportion of blocks signalling support for BIP91 over a much larger number of blocks. Perhaps 1000?
I'm not a fan of that site for a few reasons. One is that they don't explain what the black bars are. I guess they are shorter-duration means, but they don't say that, and they don't explain how many blocks each of the measures use.
They're also equating bit 4 signalling to BIP91 support, but the problem with doing that is that it is impossible to signal on bit 4 without supporting SegWit2x. Even if you don't run SegWit2x software, signalling on bit 4 helps activate it on other nodes. They need to call it "SegWit2x" instead of BIP91. It's misleading otherwise.
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:05:33
It actually can, which is why Jeff Garzik agreed with as much, and he and others recommend actions to prevent it from happening.
It's not a coding bug, it's a network topology problem. But it is solved by ensuring that the miners specifically connect either to their peers, or to the relay network. Without Greg's comment, they might have not realized they needed to do this in the first place. 
The same problem exists for the UASF, actually, but is solved by using a service bit to ensure that UASF clients preferentially connect to other UASF clients.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:29:49


Again, coins don't have identities, an no amount of attempted block chain analyses can change that. This is not cash, where bills have serial numbers.


Remember we're discussion opinion polls here, not actual development or deployment processes. The idea of an opinion poll is to get an idea of broad consensus across a large segment of the market. Opinion polls should at most only be used for very rough decision making of the "well, people seem to want this, I guess we might write the code up" variety. In order to get that idea of broad consensus, you want all respondents to be weighted equally - unless you have reason to believe that some were dishonest in their responses.


The opinions probably shouldn't translate into network behavior. Again, it's just a poll.
People go to school for many years taking survey methodology and statistics courses and still managed to create highly biased polls, so you never really want to trust an opinion poll fully.
The issues you bring up are why bitcoin's consensus is based on a proof of work. The issues I bring up are why I'm glad it's not based on proof of stake, although proof of work is really just abstracted proof of stake and not apparently much better in the end.

Yes, he did. And yeah, he invented the thing. But assuming that his word outweighs those of other bitcoin devs at this point is just an appeal to authority. On top of this, we have absolutely no idea how/if he might have changed his thoughts on the topic in the 7 years since he's been an active developer. Lots of thought has been poured into bitcoin since, including ways to use the existing block space *much* more efficiently.
Don't you think making better use of the space you have is a good idea before deciding it's absolutely necessary to increase the space you have? Doing it this way will ensure that full nodes are not prohibitive for people to run at home for a little longer.

I mostly agree, yes. But not because of "non-core", or even "hard fork", but because of "rushed", "untested", and "centralized development authority".
I think it is very possible for non-core client software to be rock solid. But I also think that such software would likely end up with a lot of involvement by core devs anyway.

But you aren't even replying to particularly relevant comments, lol.
If recent inside sources are to be taken at face value, what Jihan wants is to get rid of the Bitcoin Core development team, and he's *willing to adopt SegWit* to do it. He's using SegWit as a carrot, to get people to agree to a hard fork which he knows that most bitcoin core devs will never merge. If core doesn't merge the hard fork, and if the majority hash rate and economic power sticks with the hard fork, bitcoin core would indeed become largely irrelevant.
Let's pray that a single person can't successfully scheme to throw an entire dev team out on their asses. But don't think he won't adopt SegWit to achieve his grander strategy. It's become a valuable bargaining chip.
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:55:18
8 MB in theory, if all transactions are 100% witness data. The 8 meg number is a block weight, not a block size. In the real world, the outcome for block sizes would be more like 5 MB - given current common usage. I know a SegWit block on testnet intended as a stress test hit 3.7 MB, so if you doubled that and rounded up you could say 8 MB in extreme situations. But it feels dishonest to throw the 8 MB number out there without the clarification.

I had to help someone out in litecoin with a transaction that had been stuck for months.
Turns out the client keeps rebroadcasting transactions every so often if they haven't been confirmed yet.
And there's a "abandon transaction" button lurking around in litecoin core. Might be worth checking if the same thing happens in bitcoin core.
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:53:41
What's stopping us is that there is no us. There are almost as many ideas as to how to scale bitcoin as there are bitcoin developers. The bitcoin github contains six draft block size increase hard forks, for example. No doubt the authors of these proposals believe that their specific method is a good, if not the best way forward.
Bitcoin core has no leader and so nobody can force them to a consensus. As a result, the only way *anything* happens is with nearly unanimous support after a great deal of consideration.
I can say why I am not currently in favor of a hard fork, but would be open to the idea in the future.
SegWit accomplishes an effective ~ 2 MB non-witness block size, but as a soft fork. This may be the only time we'll be able to get away with greatly increasing effective block size using a soft fork. Which means that while hard forks may be necessary in the future, they are not necessary right now.
A hard fork abandons backwards compatibility, so it is a measure to be taken only when necessary. Right now, SegWit makes it unnecessary. Some time in the future that situation may certainly change.
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:07:03
Okay, so at least we're reading the same document.
Signalling SegWit and running a SegWit release are two different things, however.
That sentence you quote is flanked by other statements that clarify it:




Time frames got all messed up by the delay of SegWit's release. However, the devs present did indeed code up a block size increase hard fork and recommend it to bitcoin core.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:36:57
My previous reply was on my shit smartphone so I rushed it and didn't really give your comment the thought it deserves.
To clarify, there seem to actually be three distinct "sides" in this debate now. Those who want SegWit exclusively, those who hate it so much that they will never accept it (a large chunk of and those who are OK with a combination of the two things.
The folks who have been OK with the combination, ever since the HK agreement, have considered SegWit on its own to not be enough of an effective block size increase. Because SegWit can't increase effective block size any further, they want a second way to do so that combines with SegWit to result in 4-8 MB serialized block sizes. But "serialized block size" is new terminology. They've kept using the only concept of block size despite how SegWit changes things. This requires a hard fork.
When they say "2 MB hard fork", they almost certainly mean to change the non-witness data cap... an effective doubling. They'll likely double the witness data cap as well. The result will be, I believe, an average effective block size of 4.6 MB. But block explorers that report only the block size minus witness data will report it as a 2 MB limit.
So calling it a 2 MB hard fork is confusing as shit, but calling it what it really is doesn't fit nicely in a twitter comment and requires explanation.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:15:13

Not sure what the prices will do. If August 1st is a non-event I expect price to rise, as there's probably some lingering fear out there about that particular date. But I could also be wrong. The market never fails to surprise me.
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:45:03
Ah, if you're suggesting that BIP91 and BIP91 lock-in are two different things, they aren't. The "lock in" is just a phase of the activation procedure for BIP 91. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:33:50
What's misleading is everyone who has started talking about BIP91 instead of SegWit2x. No doubt because when you praise SegWit2x, you get a lot of backlash, but if you praise BIP91, you don't. Signalling on bit 4 allows people to make this false equivalency.
When core accused SegWit2x of not being compatible, that was based on an early (pre-code) reading of the agreement which suggested that signalling would *only* be on bit 4, never on bit 1. That situation was resolved.
However, it seems that Peter would have preferred if they signaled SegWit2x activation on, say, bit 6 (or something not already claimed), and then still signalling for SegWit activation on bit 1 after SegWit2x activation.
The main reason I can think of for wanting to do this is if core wanted to keep its options open for rolling out a BIP91 SegWit deployment that would not contribute to activating SegWit2x. Not that it's particularly difficult to change signalling bits, though, so Peter is being a little bit dramatic.
Another problem is that bit 4 is for signalling a soft fork. But SegWit2x is a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:15:03
I was around back then, I do agree, things have taken a turn for the worse. The fact that bitcoin is no longer suitable for many of the use cases we were all so excited about doesn't even seem to register for many people - perhaps because they're too new to remember.
But there's also the possibility that those use cases were never realistic in the first place. When Satoshi proposed bitcoin, people were critical of its ability to scale even before the software for it existed. Satoshi's multiple responses ([one]( [two]( to that was that full nodes would just be huge powerful machines in data centres, everyone else would use SPV, and blocks would be huge. A large chunk of the community, despite respecting Satoshi, have rejected that particular method of scaling as being too centralized. I can honestly understand why. While the remainder of the community wants Satoshi's vision as-is, despite being in danger of appealing to authority. So here we are... 
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:47:45
Well, you can think of it as harm, but years from now we might look back on it as the catalyst that led to better ways to work towards consensus, and development of more robust activation systems. You can't deny that the situation has led to a vast bestiary of ideas.
Would Shaolin Fry have written [BIP 8]( in a more peaceful climate? That could easily become the de-facto activation method from now on.
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:39:41
Moderators can influence the narrative seen on reddit and other forums. So you mean you/others tried to start a grassroots campaign to increase block size to 2 MB and the mods put a stop to that?
Why did you think reddit was your only avenue, or even the most important?
It seems more likely that the effort failed because devs, not reddit moderators, decided against it. Or people didn't want to run BitcoinXT. Can't force them to do so.
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:10:57
And then there will be another 2.3 days of "lock in" before actual enforcement of bit 1 signalling begins. We may see preemptive bit 1 signalling, however.
So, the fireworks will almost certainly begin on Sunday. Expect to see the front page absolutely clogged with people reporting what percent are signalling bit 1, how close SegWit is to lock-in, etc. A good day for some popcorn.

And if you don't understand how to look for yourself at what bits blocks have been signalling, there are two very clear reasons even in OP's excel sheet and post telling you, without question, that he's measuring bit 4.
1. BIP91 signalling is via bit 4, not bit 1, which is what he's talking about.
2. He's mentioned a 336 block window, which is only applicable for bit 4 signalling. SegWit activation via bit 1 uses a much longer block window.

I didn't think an explanation was necessary. Putting economic pressure on miners to switch to the UASF chain is part of how the UASF works. But it only works that way if enough nodes enforce it. And not just any nodes - ones which relay and generate a large proportion of the network's transactions. The so-called "economic nodes".
Luke may not be restating all of that every time he posts, but it's already been discussed to death.


You sure about that? I'm talking about mining centralization here, by the way. There are obviously many different ways in which bitcoin can become centralized (or otherwise).
Centralization is both a process AND a state. So your semantic argument is kind of silly. Do yourself a favor and consult a dictionary prior to attempting to enforce specific meanings to words.

From ethereum's page:


I suppose that's open to arguing over semantics, but the implications do indeed seem to be decentralization, immutability, censorship-resistance, and the works. The current state of things seems to me to threaten that goal. A centralized dev team can be manipulated - eg, by law enforcement. You gotta know not all the dapps are going to be legal... there goes your censorship resistance and lack of third-party interference.
The dev team is going to have to transition to a different governance style if they intend to fulfill the dream. One that more closely resembles bitcoin core's, IMO. Either that or relocate to a country that never gives a shit... and never travel again.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:10:33
Well, that's unfortunate if true.
All of my hopeful (sort of) comments over the past few hours were based entirely on the assumption that their activation scheme would be compatible with the existing SegWit deployment.

@_date: 2017-05-31 12:40:45
I believe BIP148 may be a necessary risk to rekindle some of bitcoin's independence from corporate control (even though it requires corporate support).
However, I am also VERY happy to see core devs with differences of opinion, having to try to come to terms with each other.
The alternative is to have a more traditional development team, with a lead dev and/or project manager who calls the shots. That is something I believe should be resisted for bitcoin, as it is a form of centralized authority. This is why I am wary of projects like Bitcoin Unlimited, which have much more centralized leadership. That centralized leadership might allow them to whip up some code and get it out there without all the overhead of arguments and consensus within the team and such, but it comes at the cost of an important peer review process.
@_date: 2017-07-12 18:57:12
It's hard to say. I think we're going to see a very heated debate in between SegWit2x lock-in and the HF activation 3 months down the line. Although 80% hash rate is a pretty serious majority, I'm not sure it's a good idea to assume they'll stick with it for 3 months.
It's *probably* a safe assumption, but good engineering should plan for the worst cases.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:05:08
I was hanging around this forum a few months before Gox went bust, under a different username. So I will do what we all did back then: focus on use cases.
The dream was that bitcoin would not just be a digital savings account, but that it would revolutionize every facet of the financial system. Although I think most people expressed these views as hopes rather than certainties, there remained the possibility that it would happen. And with SegWit and LN, some of that hope might be restored.
- P2P payments in developing countries
- Microtransactions
- Paypal killer
- Insanely cheap international remittance
- OpenBazaar
Some of those may work out for some people despite scaling issues. But mass adoption won't happen if fees keep going up and transaction backlogs get longer and longer. Maybe some people don't actually want mass adoption, would rather bitcoin be an underground thing, but you need mass adoption to revolutionize the financial system - and that's what bitcoin still is all about to me.
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:06:45
What I mean is that you currently have zero options for support SegWit activation bit BIP91 that do not also support SegWit2x hard fork. Hence, no standalone options. This is because bit 4 is being shared between BIP91 and SegWit2x.
Signalling on bit 4 should be interpreted as "BIP91 + SegWit2x" support. Programmatically, they are inseparable. You can in theory use the "NYC" text in the coinbase string to figure this out, but that's not what the code is doing.
Even if you don't run SegWit2x, eg if you run the SegSignal client instead, you are still contributing to the lock-in of the hard fork component of SegWit2x.
Of course, if *nobody* runs SegWit2x, then it's all a non-issue.
There are lots of rumors of fake signalling, but you can't tell whether or not miners are doing this right now. They either signal on bit 4, or they don't. That's not enough to go on yet.

Re-writing SegWit is different from re-writing the activation mechanism. Activating it on a new version bit doesn't have to change SegWit itself.
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:55:46
Yes, but BIP91 - which SegWit2x uses - is neutral. James is a bitcoin dev but has yet to brand himself (as far as I can tell) with either "bitcoin core" or "SegWit2x". Similar to Shaolin Fry in that regard.
And, IMO, we need more of these sorts of folks. Nothing wrong with bitcoin core, but slightly more independent devs who contribute to multiple implementations without hesitation will make bitcoin better. Greg Maxwell is like that as well, to some extent - he likes bug testing and critiquing other people's code, which is a valuable service.

Nobody is enforcing. Please explain to me what you think "enforcing" means, because it's clear you are using the term in a very strange way. Enforcing would mean orphaning blocks that aren't signalling on bit 1, which is absolutely not happening. 
Are you confusing testnet with the production bitcoin by chance?
Perhaps you should go back to the start of this conversation, as you seem to have lost track of what we're talking about. This is what you originally said:

2 MB non-witness data would double the permitted amount of non-witness data. To be consistent, the witness data cap would have to double as well in order to keep the ratio between them the same.
This would bring the effective average block size to 4.6 MB, assuming that SegWit alone gives you 2.3 MB on average, which is the last estimate I read.

Okay, let me rephrase - miner activated sudden hashrate loss leading to extreme long block times and months until a difficulty adjustment.
Trust me, if &gt; 80% of miners insist on mining 2x blocks and nobody else does, bitcoin will be fucked. People say miners will be forced to follow the rest of the economy, but it can just as easily go the other way.


Maybe. Can you link to code or something? BIP91 itself doesn't require miners signal on bit 1 until after activation, and actually leaves it up to the miner to make sure they're doing so.
The NYA itself suggested miners would wait until lock-in, but what seemed to happen was they all just did whatever they wanted with no standardization at all. Oh well, in the end it seems to have worked.
I probably will have to agree with you though. I am not sure this means the signalling was fake... just that the lack of standardization between them means that they were not all using the same software. I seem to recall there being a rumor that btc1 missed its deadline, had bugs, and that miners ended up using segsignal or modified core software, like you suggested.
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:13:15
Yes, there's certainly much importance on validating nodes to decide what blocks are valid.
However, in this situation you're going to get a chain split. On one chain, only nodes which recognize big blocks, and 80% of hash power... and large, influential economic nodes like BitPay.
On the other chain, &lt; 20% hash power, huge delays, months before a difficulty adjustment.
Which chain is economically more valuable? Full nodes only matter in a big way if they are also economically important...
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:45:09
Nothing will happen with them if you wait it out. If the split is particularly bad, you might consider avoiding making transactions until the dust settles.
If you have 10 bitcoins right now, you will have 10 on both chains for as long as they both persist. After the dust settles, you'll still have 10 on whatever chain wins.
Price during a split is likely to go down. It may start a bear market. The more evenly distributed hash power and validating nodes are between the two chains, the more severe the event will be. If one chain is an extreme minority, the chain split may go almost unnoticed by those not paying attention.
Bitcoin [has already had a chain split]( that lasted 6 hours. Note that the article incorrectly calls the event a fork. A hard fork can lead to a chain split, but they aren't the same thing. The UASF is sort of a temporary "medium fork" event which is why the risk of a chain split is there despite it being a "soft fork", and why that risk will go away in November when the UASF expires. Normally, a soft fork would not carry that kind of risk. Minimizing risk at this point requires people piling on.
For what it's worth, I don't believe you need to worry (much).

If we're talking about a sliding block size system, then the only good option IMO is an automatic adjustment based on objective network metrics, in much the same way difficulty auto adjusts.
We need to stop giving miners more power over bitcoin. They have enough already. I value the role they play in the network, but giving them more ways to adjust network parameters could easily lead to centralization.
But it's a pipe dream because there's still plenty of room for endless bickering over exactly what metrics to use to determine a target block size. Perhaps the simplest is to set a target "blocks must be this full on average". So I'm kind of a fan of [BIP 104](
But I'm a realist, and that will not happen, and SegWit is really the next actually realistic thing that can help. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:33:02
If they use both bits, as described by James Hilliard.
It's nice to see that the pastebin version was not entirely complete, and that the final version adds a few critical details like the time delay between SegWit activation and HF activation. Moreover, Segwit2MB uses SegWit as we know it - a soft fork, not modified from core's implementation. So long as the signatories stick with that plan, we can be sure that there is no funny business in regards to mucking about with SegWit to, for example, keep covert ASICBoost on the table.
I've been looking at the UASF situation with great interest. But I'm going to be honest - if there really is a huge hash rate in agreement for this, and if it doesn't conflict with the existing SegWit deployment, and if 6 months is long enough to prepare and plan for a block size hard fork, then I am not entirely opposed to this. It's a fairly large effective block size increase but not unbounded and not emergent consensus, which would give too much power to miners IMO.
This is the closest to a realistic compromise I've seen in a long time. But the HK agreement was realistic, as well. So this is not a sure thing. We would need a more solid commitment to this solution for it to work out.
However, if I read this correctly, it is entirely out of core's hands now. The node software is likely well on the way to being developed and the signatories will be running 3rd party software, probably (hopefully) compatible with the existing SegWit deployment. I wonder how quickly this is all going to happen.
But let's not give up on UASF - just in case, like the HK agreement, this falls through as well.

That's not entirely the conclusion I was attempting to make but I guess I was not clear.

Make it more clear that they're actually asking for 4 MB.

There can't be a true split if there is no hash power to extend the old chain.
What you'd end up with is an old chain that some (not many) clients will keep connecting to, but when they make transactions they will never be confirmed. The reason very few clients will connect to the old chain is that most client software automatically follows the longest chain.
But getting 100% hash power seems impossible given how contentious a short-notice hard fork organized by this particular group will be, no matter the content.

The actual change to 2 MB is changing of a constant. There isn't much open to creative problem solving in this case. The proposal is available since 2015 as [BIP 102](
The main detail in BIP 102 that will require scrutiny is the activation mechanism, as it doesn't seem to provide a grace period allowing for people to upgrade nodes and wallets (or not) as a result of the outcome.
The hard-ish part is the activation mechanism. Luckily there are some that have already been tested that can be selected. SegWit's mechanism seems like a good one, although the threshold may be too high given mining centralization. It provides that grace period after lock-in but before activation that could be quite important in this case.
Of course, if the goal is to create a BIP that merges SegWit with the 2 MB hard fork so that you have to say adopt or reject the package deal, then it's still not particular complex, but would require a bit more work no doubt.
If this thread continues to get positive response I do hope the devs will at least consider something. As long as it has an activation mechanism with a decent supermajority requirement, the risk can be nicely managed.
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:37:42
Impossible to have a 0-byte block, because all blocks must have a coinbase transaction.
Empty blocks that appear less than a minute or so after the last are due to premining.
What you want to look out for are empty blocks that appear fairly long after the last. When you find those, you know the block was left empty for some reason other than premining, and it's highly suspect.

Has there been an official release of the "Barry Silbert Proposal"?
Was James Hilliard involved in the discussions or been given any sort of indication that splitting the proposal in this way will satisfy the signatories?
I have a hard time believing miners will go for this, since the proposal (which still isn't confirmed AFAIK) suggests the signatories want all of it to be activated simultaneously.
How will miners react?
80% is still a high threshold but if it can work, great.

@_date: 2017-07-18 19:26:47
No, that's not how it works.
They only have to signal on bit 4 to start with, but they can *completely optionally* signal on bit 1 as well. Bit 1 signalling is only enforced if enough of the miners first signal via bit 4. The requirement is 80% of the blocks over a 336 block period. After that occurs, bit 1 signalling starts after another 336 block delay.
We'll know if this happens probably before the end of the week... if the 80% threshold occurs, followed by the delay, but then some miners don't turn on bit 1... we'll know at that point that they were fake signalling.

I'd be more comfortable with him working on the consensus layer than Jeff, that's for sure.

Once SegWit locks in, it's here to stay. There is no undoing it without a code deployment. If miners put even a single invalid transaction into a block, the entire block is invalid and rejected by validating nodes. If they try, they'll find themselves spending a lot of money and getting no block rewards or fees whatsoever. The nature of the transactions that get put into blocks is decided by the nodes. If miners decide to alter transactions to make them non-SegWit, or ignore SegWit transactions, they're just screwing themselves over... very badly. They're welcome to do so.

I'm not sure what you mean by "delivered to recommend".
There are six BIPs still open for various block size increases, all hard forks (by necessity), and there's a 2 MB one on there. BIP 102.
A BIP is the closest you get to a recommendation on the bitcoin github. Code won't be merged in until it actually being implimented for real.
Most actual bitcoin development seems to happen off GitHub. Discussion takes place in the mailing list, which has a public archive. I've never really browsed through it but perhaps it's worth looking at. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:35:29
Yup, that's right. Full nodes that don't upgrade will find themselves watching a stuck chain if the hard fork gets 100% of the hash power.
But again, this is somewhat hypothetical because I am sure at least some miners will disagree with the hard fork on principle and stick with the legacy chain. But if they represent a very small amount of hash power, the chain will still be effectively stuck or at least extremely slow for a long time, until difficulty adjusts.
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:25:03
Thankfully, unless they want a persistent chain split, they still need to appease the rest of us in order to get their hard fork. I guess they actually need basically 100% support to avoid a chain split with the hard fork, but a chain split would be worse as it gets closer to 50/50. So to some extent the risk of a large chain split might make them think twice about doing overly controversial things.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:41:56
I can understand why you have that point of view and I have to thank you for not being confrontational in your reply. My point of view is different, so allow me to explain. Sorry that it's a bit long.
First, [see here]( Even when miners are included, there is very high support for SegWit among bitcoin businesses. Not even that is an inclusive community, but it's more inclusive than looking only to miners. And while I agree, having users voting on reddit or twitter is a terrible way to determine consensus, that's not how the UASF works work anyway.
Some folks have ascribed miners some sort of exclusive enforcement power while downplaying the importance of validating nodes and the history of the situation. Miners were quite recently given the responsibility to decide on activation of changes to the bitcoin protocol. The activation system used for SegWit is almost as new as SegWit itself. There's an older system that predates it that, as far as I can tell, wasn't used much. And before that, changes were activated using flag days.
Looking to hash rate for activation signalling is not the only option, and is giving a lot of power to a very small subset of the network. The reason developers gave miners this responsibility was to avoid chain splits by assuming that the incetives of miners and the rest of the community were one and the same. It is clear that this is not the case, making the hash rate activation system much less desireable than intended. One of the co-developers of the miner activated system recently blogged an "apology", although he couldn't have known what the outcome would be.
So that brings us to now, where we have realized that we can't rely on miner activated protocol changes part way through the SegWit activation. UASF attempts to work around this MASF decision midway through the activation process. It's not without risk, but there really aren't many good options left. Even if we could go back and re-do SegWit's activation system using something like BIP 8, it would still carry the risk of a chain split.
I excpect devs will be much more hesistant to rely on hash rate signalling from this point on.
@_date: 2017-05-08 13:05:54
I suspect most node operators just download whatever binaries they find online. 
If core doesn't at least provide binaries with UASF as a choice, saying "this is an option if you want", then you're asking users to take extra steps that may well be beyond their understanding.
This may be a case where doing nothing is exactly the same thing as taking a stand against UASF. A neutral stance would be providing both binaries, with and without, and attempting to inform users as to the difference, without pushing them one way or the other, just before they go to download.

Having a real name isn't important. Exposing yourself to and responding to public scrutiny is. Whoever Satoshi was, he talked to people, and addressed their comments. People knew he was working on the project and they knew who to contact and how to contact him when they had a bone to pick, or an idea.
But I'll give you part marks. If bitcoin was still developed by a single anonymous person, I wouldn't believe in it. When Satoshi left, or at least disassociated himself from and retired the identity of SN, he paved the way for an important phase in bitcoin's maturity. We've come a long way from relying on some benevolent dictator, and there's no point in taking steps backwards. BCC is most definitely a step backwards towards a dictatorship once again.

Covert ASICBoost is more profitable (it is much more of a "boost"), and overt ASICBoost actually has fairly serious implications for the intended purpose of the version bit field.
[Here's a nice PDF]( explaining that.
But the tl;dr is this:
- SHA256 is computed in two chunks.
- The intended mode of operation for bitcoin mining is that you have to fully recompute the hash (both chunks) every time you try a different nonce.
- Overt ASICBoost allows you to keep "chunk 2" (and the nonce) constant while you muck about with the version bits, generating multiple hashes per nonce using less work than it would take to just keep cycling the nonce with a fixed version field. This only provides a small boost.
- Covert ASICBoost allows you to pull a much more complicated trick that lets you precompute a bunch of different "chunk 1" hashes and store them in memory, then cycle through several for each nonce. This provides a large boost. While harder to implement, this is more profitable.
SegWit only prevents covert ASICBoost, and even then, doesn't make it impossible. Just so difficult that it's probably not profitable anymore. 
Overt ASICBoost was rendered a bad idea when the version bits started to be used for signalling soft fork support. Imagine if miners were absolutely randomly signalling support for BU, SegWit2x, SegWit, etc? That's what overt ASICBoost would do.
If SegWit is widely adopted, the problem (as far as we can tell right now) is essentially fixed. Covert ASICBoost will no longer be profitable, and overt ASICBoost will get you loudly yelled at incessantly for breaking soft fork signalling.

They are not closely related, except in the sense that the folks behind BCC created it in part because they don't like SegWit, or the bitcoin core dev team.
You might think of core+SegWit and the BCC fork as representing the two polar opposite ideas of how to scale bitcoin. Core and SegWit represent a more multi-layered approach that attempts to scale bitcoin by finding extremely efficient ways to use limited block space, combined with an effective doubling of block size if enough people start using SegWit transactions. The BCC fork increases block size and doesn't implement SegWit. It and other proposals that only increase block size represents a more brute force approach. They scale immediately, but at the cost of some (unknown) amount of node decentralization.

You *want* there to be incompatibility. Otherwise the SPV client will connect to god knows which chain. And there *will* be two chains, likely of very dissimilar value. Do you want people's client software to automagically chose between one or the other, with the user being unsure of the fair market value of their bitcoins because they have no idea whether they are legacy bitcoins or SegWit2x bitcoins? Do you think you can promise that the hard fork chain will be the longest chain? The requirement for an 80% hash power majority ends when the hard fork locks in... and the hash rate could go anywhere between lock-in and activation.
And that's why you need more than 3 months. You need enough time for a huge proportion of the entire user base to voluntarily upgrade. I think Microsoft could tell you a thing or two about how difficult a problem that is.

There really is no distinction between BIP 91 and SegWit2x in this case. SegWit2x is using BIP91, but that's not all that bit 4 is doing (it's also signalling for activation of the hard fork).
There is currently no practical way to signal support for BIP 91, but not for SegWit2x.
So the percentage of miners signalling on bit 4 = the percentage support BIP91 = the percentage supporting SegWit2x.
Maybe some miners plan to pull a fast one and not actually run the SegWit2x software in the end. We'll have to see :)

So they made a choice for functionality vs design and I think in this case it was the right choice.

Don't *push* it. Just *offer* it. Be careful with what defaults you set. Don't default to turning it on. Make sure it has to be a decision on the user's part.
When it comes down to it, you guys still have to decide what to pull in, and what stays as just a BIP forever. You can't divorce yourselves of some sort of authority, even though I know you don't want it. At best you can just be sure that the default setting is "status quo" and changes require deliberate action by others.
The other side of the equation is making sure people are informed enough to decide if they want to turn that checkbox on. I can't help but feel there's still a ton of misinformation out there. Not that people necessarily want to deliberately misinform, but that there's an information vacuum. I've yet to see a really good, understandable explanation of how the UASF works, what the hell an "economic node" is, etc. What's "economic consensus"? How do you measure it? Nobody seems to know. If it's not quantifiable then how does the UASF even work? Probably my own fault for not looking hard enough... but it shouldn't require that much effort to find. This info needs to be front and center.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:28:54
Well, that's what the proposal they linked to does, and it's all we have to go on for now, until they actually write the code.
It is a little sketchy that miners and CEOs have committed to making technical changes without a whole lot of actual developer feedback. Hopefully they are willing to stray from the details of their agreement if technical considerations demand it. And stating that willingness should have been part of the damned agreement.

"Delayed and responsible" doesn't seem likely. There's only a 3 month grace period between SegWit activation and activation of the hard fork.

The way BIP91 works is, that number will be stuck at 44% until, very very suddenly, it will go up to 100%.
You'll see. It's probably going to happen this week.
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:27:40
That website is a bit misleading. They are ignoring the fact that bit 4 is not capable of signalling for standlone support for BIP91.
Change all occurrences of "BIP91" on that website to "SegWit2x + BIP91", and you have a better picture of reality.
If someone wants to support BIP91 but NOT SegWit2x, they will need to redeploy BIP91 with a different activation bit.

The legitimate big-block equivalent of bitcoin already exists, but it's not clearly such right off the bat. It's litecoin.
Its blocks are the same size as bitcoin's, but the block time is 2.5 minutes instead of 10, so the mb/min and theoretical throughput is 4x that of bitcoin. Bitcoin has 0.1 mb/min right now, litecoin has 0.4 mb/min.  With SegWit, its blocks are about double that again, so it is your 8 mb/10 min coin.
But its blocks are practically empty all of the time because only a very small community regularly uses it for anything. 
If there was tons of demand for a bitcoin with that kind of throughout, why hasn't litecoin been snapped up like crazy?
My guess is because the bitcoiners who want big blocks also want them to be called "bitcoin" and they want to carry over the bitcoin balances from the current blockchain.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:37:03
And since bitcoin blocks arrive every 10 minutes, it will take a while to determine the hashrate accurately. You have to determine it statistically using the process below:
1. Determine what hashrate is necessary in theory to satisfy the current difficulty every 10 minutes. Optionally correct for the actual rate of block generation.
2. Use a large number of blocks (a thousand or more) to determine what proportion of that estimate each miner has, and multiply.
And when you multiply two estimates together you get an even less precise estimate. For that reason, the more blocks you use for  the better.
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:26:39
AFAIK SPV clients only loosely check validity. They do not check block size because by nature of how they work, they don't download the block in the first place. Just individual transactions.
Electrum, Multibit, and others are SPV clients. They put their trust in nodes they connect to, rather than doing much verification themselves.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:06:52
Yeah, and I imagine it wouldn't be in a cell. House arrest or community service thrown in there. If you read the article he basically poached clients from his employer, but did so by stealing customer data from the company's servers which is no doubt the larger crime.

I support core's SegWit implementation over SegWit2x, but this guy is really reaching. He's throwing out the same level of conspiracy theory that I constantly poke fun at rbtc for encouraging and which is a bit embarrassing to see on the r/bitcoin front page.
I've not gone over Erik's communications with a fine tooth comb or anything, but IMO he's one of the more reasonable non-core voices in the debate.

I bought in about 3 weeks before you did. When it went up to $1100, my office mate looked at the chart and said "you should sell", complete with an explanation on how Gox was having withdrawal issues and how he felt it was about to come tumbling down. Gox mysteriously turned into a blank white page within days of my office mate's prophecy, and later announced their insolvency.
I too held, and while it was probably easier for me since my cost basis was lower, it was still a long time to be wondering if I was making the right decision.
Looks like we both came out ahead in the end. Although some very lucky traders who sold at that peak at bought in later no doubt did even better.
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:38:06
Only a proportion of the community is on board - even there, where it's being actively promoted on the main page, it's controversial.
If it survives, it'll just be another mostly irrelevant altcoin.

You're right. rbtc is not single-minded and there are moderates and extremists on both sides to be sure.
But rbtc clearly has a much higher incidence of extremism. It's evident in the language being used, and in the stories being upvoted to the front page. Supporting Craig's claim of being Satoshi? Really? The sub looses almost all credibility from that alone.
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:31:24
If there's some good figuring backing up the assumption of at least 51%, then miners should strongly consider pointing their hardware at obviously unrelated pools. Bitcoin has been in that situation before with Ghash.io. It can be fixed if people are aware of it.
Assuming, of course, that enough of bitmain's hash power is coming from third parties, and not internally. If it's all internal, we definitely have a problem.
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:00:43
I'm concerned about who is backing it.
You can accuse the NYA of being forged behind closed doors but at least it has broad miner consensus.
BitcoinABC hasn't even revealed their Github repo membership, and Bitmain - who already are far too powerful - appear to be the ones championing it.
Even if it's "free" coins, I hesitate to legitimize it by going anywhere near it. And chances are I'd have to find some random exchange and go through their KYC process just to trade it away. The value of the coins may literally not be worth the effort needed to sell them.
@_date: 2017-07-20 10:37:24
We know who is signaling and what those pools hash rates have been over any number of blocks you care to count. Only Slush is hard to predict because of how their users decide how to signal, so you can't attribute all of slush hashrate.
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:30:39
Everything depends on intent.
Maybe it was some bitcoin startup that mucked up their code and sent tons of dust transactions completely by accident.
But if it really was a DoS attack, it's got nothing to do with design. In fact bitcoin should be more robust to such things than other systems because fulling up the mempool, even with transactions that never confirm, locks away funds. So you need money to pull off an attack like this.
If it a DoS attack, it was a result of assholes. Design has little to do with it.

My simulation concurs with OP's, activation probability this period had dropped drastically to 33%.
R code:
    blocksLeft = 220
    sigBlocksNeeded = 179
    
    iterations = 10000
    simSuccessCounter = 0
    
    hashRate = 80
    
    for (i in 1:iterations) {
      blockTestVals = sample(1:100, blocksLeft, replace=T)
      sigBlocks = sum(blockTestVals &lt;= hashRate)
      if (sigBlocks &gt;= sigBlocksNeeded) {
        simSuccessCounter = simSuccessCounter + 1
      }
    }
    probability = simSuccessCounter / iterations
    probability
    [1] 0.3295
So there's a good chance the weekend will not be as fun as we were hoping, but oh well, shit happens.
Looks like OP's math works perfectly well, so I won't post any more of these. I just saw the drastic drop and needed to confirm it myself.
Caveat: if F2Pool or Slush begins to signal, or Bitcoin.com resumes signalling, the probability will increase.

"Users", however, includes everybody... miners too. And people running SPV wallets, who defer to miners on some of the finer points of the protocol (such as block size).
What matters in terms of "users" are the ones generating and/or relaying lots of transactions, so this rules out most of the home nodes as well.
That being said, power users - who are more likely to actually care about this stuff in the first place - will have the means to actively chose which chain they are on.

I've already explained why I feel a decentralized design for a community simply cannot work* at scale without technology we don't yet possess. If you disagree, you have only one option: build one, get a million people using it, and tell me I was an idiot. Until then, discussion over.
\* My definition of "working" would be based on an assessment of the quality of discussion on such a community
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:57:48


This is the most anti-science viewpoint I've ever heard a self-professed scientist ever claim. Attribution is non-optional. No room for debate on that point. Attribution is literally the only way that sources of information can be vetted for the quality of their methods and data.
I have to keep voucher specimens of my study organisms and make them available to the community. I have to provide raw data sets. I have to attach my *real name* and those of my collaborators, including e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and workplace addresses to documents so that people can can get in touch with us if they want to check our data or methods. I have to cite other sources of data or ideas by name and date of publication, with enough information to allow people to go to a local library and find a copy. And this is what all scientists have to do. ALL. Not just STEM, but economics, social science, political science, everything.
If you fail to do these things, you are not a scientist. If you fail to do these things, you are committing intellectual dishonesty and doing the broader scientific community a disservice by obfuscating your efforts and identity, making it difficult to replicate and independently verify your work.
Going to school to learn how to do science is not just some profiteering industry that sells overly expensive pieces of paper that say "M.Sc." or "Ph.D." on them. While academia has its problems, it nevertheless teaches you absolutely essential skills and etiquette to participate in the world's community. Some countries even provide this training for free, but I know many people on this sub hate that damned socialist nonsense. Damned if you do, damned if you don't, haha.
The scientific community has rules, and those rules exist for very good reasons. You established at the beginning of this discussion that you believe communities should not have rules that limit what can be published. You believe that these rules are censorship. But these rules enable the community to exist in the first place.
Despite having rules, the scientific community is healthily decentralized. It exists across every country, across universities both public and private, and even industry and government. Publications are becoming increasingly open-access, stored in digital format on servers across the world. It's the best community we have for figuring stuff out.
If you legitimately want to make scientific contributions, as opposed to being relegated to predatory journals and conferences that don't do adequate peer review and trick people into attending, then you need to play by the rules.

Okay, so far my take home then is that this incident is probably just a hiccup, as it appears that testing hasn't even started, and there are so few resources committed to testnet5 that a single misbehaving node can fork it.
In other words *testing hasn't even started*. Does nobody else consider that absolutely insane?! The beta software is out - what the hell is the holdup? The time frame was already way too short, there's no time for them to NOT be testing at this point.

Web site operators have tried the same defense. It seems to be shaky defense, at least in the US. At least for telecomm they can successfully argue that it would be far too much work to monitor and censor all communications, so the best they can do is participate with law enforcement in tracking down the individuals who use the services illegally.
Ethereum has already set the precedent that they are willing (and able) to intervene by hard forking to return stolen funds to TheDAO investors. Given that, they are going to have a very hard time arguing that doing so is difficult.
And despite all that, I actually do have some Eth holdings. Actually 50% of my total crypto. I just figured it was a wise way to hedge by bets against whatever the hell is going to happen this year regarding bitcoin. I could see myself going back to 100% bitcoin if things don't go completely horribly wrong.

Development of bitcoin made a lot of progress when it moved from being done by one guy (Satoshi) to a larger team requiring peer review. This helped harden bitcoin itself against the whims of any individual or corporation.
I am not particularly happy that Jeff Garzik has eroded that progress by putting the development process back in the hands of what appears to be a single guy (himself).
The SegWit soft fork, however, is probably safe.  SegWit2x requires SegWit activation before they can hard fork, so one way or another, they're going to activate SegWit, and all they're really doing there is a convoluted process leading to signalling of regular old SegWit. There are far worse ways they could have chosen to do that.
It's really the hard fork itself that we need to be focusing on. Unless development of the hard fork is highly inclusive, distributing development authority across as many disparate people as possible, I have no intention of supporting it *even if* I happen to agree with the usefulness of further block size increases (within reason).
To me, it's not the technical details of the hard fork that are a concern. It's the power grab. Miners must be kept at arms length from the development process. If they are not, they can modify bitcoin in ways that will pervert it beyond all reason, just for some short term (on the order of years) financial gain. Quick money is more psychologically tempting than the long view, and if miners see the opportunity to profit even if it might destroy bitcoin years down the road, they will.
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:18:08
Jeff Garzik *was* a core dev. He hasn't been active in that capacity for quite a long time, now.
That being said, I read what he has to say and think you read into his words only what you wanted to see.
I not only read his original post that you linked to, but searched for all his follow up replies, and nowhere does he discuss the effect of segwit on transaction fees.
He thinks it won't help with the block size issue. Whether it does or not depends on the extent to which segwit is adopted. So it seems he think segwit adoption will be mininal, as it has been with litecoin (a case he brings up). But the thing is, litecoin doesn't have much reason to actually use segwit transactions to make their blocks larger in the first place, or to reduce fees, or to solve problems with 3rd party transaction malleability. Litecoin is barely being used by anyone, for anything resembling real-world adoption. Considering that SegWit assists with security and scaling of a suite of adoption cases, I am not surprised that litecoin hasn't used it in the end.
Bitcoin is a different beast entirely, and I think segwit transactions will be quite common almost the moment it activates. It'll take a while to build up to near 100%, but probably not as long as Jeff thinks.

They would have had three distinct types of "purses". The private non-crypto database keeping track of trades and account balances (basically IOUs). The bitcoin private keys controlled by btc-e that the exchange active works with, and cold storage private keys.
Seizure probably compromised the first two types. If btc-e was able to move quickly when their servers were taken down (which is quite possible), they may have been able to move the coins in their live bitcoin addresses to a new one before the FBI had a chance to take the equipment back to wherever for investigation.
The private account balance DB is really just a ledger of IOUs, and as long as btc-e made backups that can still be used to return people's money. The bitcoin private keys hooked directly into the exchange may be compromised (depending on how btc-e secured their private key). And cold storage should have been kept in a secret location in multisig addresses. Should...
Depending on how wealthy the operators/business is, they may actually be able to make good on their promise.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:10:15
Now let me tell you what I really want.
Completely separate SegWit and 2 MB HF activations with flag days at 51%+ miner signalling requirement. A simple majority requirement for both, and separately, would make both activations highly reachable if there is any support whatsoever, even in the face of one or two strong camps of opposition.
I do believe this is precisely how P2SH was activated - it wasn't just a straight-up UASF, it also had a simple majority hash rate requirement.
IMO it would just get it all over and done with. We'd probably end up with both anyway, with the benefit of knowing that nobody had to use carrots (or sticks) to get there.
But that would have to wait until the current SegWit deployment fails, I do believe, and with UASF looming the timing of the situation is quite pressing.
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:49:01
If BCC becomes the dominant coin, I'd be done with bitcoin entirely. Litecoin would get my vote at that point.
BCC development is secretive, non-transparent. Open source only technically. We don't even know who the devs are. That's a deal breaker.
Your opinion makes a lot of sense if you're just in this game to make money. If you actually want the underlying technology to succeed, you put your money with the one you feel is the best bet. And it's pretty clear to me that BCC does not preserve the fundamental values of bitcoin.

I find it highly noteworthy that the entire crypto market (well, almost) crashed together, and now the entire crypto market (again, almost) rebounded together.
This tells me that to a huge proportion of traders... "crypto" is just one asset. When bitcoin crashed, it wasn't because people were moving in ether or litecoin. They got out entirely, into fiat. Similar, ether and litecoin crashed at the same time, yet that didn't seem to materialize into people buying bitcoin.
Very interesting. Makes me wonder what the causes were... if any. Could have been purely psychological.

Yeah, I have noticed that, and you're right. Not all UASF supporters are fanatics, however. The UASF started out with a much more agreeable goal of requiring economic consensus. It still does, but some folks seem to have forgotten - they think that game theory will stack the deck, but that's far from certain given how vehemently opposed to it some of the big players are.

It's becoming difficult to seperate the BU fans from the ETH fans, really. And to be fair, Vitalik is quite smart and an easy guy to like. I see the allure. He's a benevolent dictator over Ethereum - what some people wish Satoshi still was for Bitcoin.
But what I don't understand is why many of the same folks who rallying against perceived corporate control over bitcoin development don't seem to have the same problem with Ethereum... I mean, ETC is right there. If they want to be consistent, they should be rooting for ETC instead of ETH.

Bit 4 signalling is no longer relevant since the lock-in of BIP91/SegWit2x has already occurred. Segwit signalling is happening entirely on bit 1, no matter what type of node you are running.
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:23:42

Well they still call it beta software, so I guess they could argue that this is the *eventual* goal, but that there will be bumps along the way.

@_date: 2017-07-18 13:23:44
There is no meaningful deployment of standlone BIP91. That's my point. SegWit2x is using bit 4 to simultaneously activate their implementation of BIP91 and the block size increase hard fork.
If you signal on bit 4, you support both SegWit and the block size increase hard fork via SegWit2x. This is what Peter Todd is getting bent out of shape about in the mailing list post that was linked to today.
BIP91 via bit 4 does not exist, and can no longer exist.
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:13:32
Ah, pruning nodes make that unnecessary. The more important requirements are the unavoidable bandwidth needs for sending and receiving transactions and blocks, memory for storage recent transactions and blocks, and CPU power needed to verify recent transactions and blocks. All of which an RPi is more than capable of handling for the foreseeable future, unless block size grows considerably (in which case I suspect future versions of the RPi will keep up anyway).
Still, you want some archival nodes in there. So some folks do indeed need to set up slightly more powerful systems with raid arrays.
We're in a situation where not all nodes are equal, and that's OK. RPis may not be archival nodes, people on limited internet may have peer limits, and some full nodes may indeed be thousand-dollar systems or more. They all contribute.
The use of RPi as full node is perhaps a bit of a fashion trend, to be honest. It might be unrealistic to adopt that as a target system requirement for all time.

Price movements are very hard to predict for events that are not strikingly "good" or "bad". IMO, Satoshi's reappearance and/or movement of those coins could do literally anything to the price, and I'm including "nothing at all" in the list of possibilities.
There are more immediate things that can affect the price - such as actual sales of large quantities of bitcoin, new regulation, theft, security problems, further fork threats, etc.
But just look at what the price is doing in response to the threat of a *permanent hard fork* that will happen in about 12 hours. You'd think it would be going down, but no. Of all the things it could be doing, for some damned reason it's going up.

It's a reasonable thing to want. Might also be a good idea to want to adhere to a set of founding principles, however. To some extent we seem to be at a crossroads. In one direction is a bitcoin that strongly adheres to its founding principles but, as a consequence, has more limited commercial application. In the other direction is mass commercial application, but at the cost of censorship resistance and with a real risk of centralized governance.
We can probably have both worlds, but getting there will require more patience than I expect corporations and miners have.

60% of the community? Please.
There are no easy ways to measure economic consensus until the UASF switches on. Even then it will take some doing because it's a "wait and see what happens" type of measurement.
The closest we can get right now is opinion polls, weighted by assumptions about the relative economic importance of the respondents.
For that, use [ and be sure to enable weighting.
So literally the best estimate it's possible to get right now, is at around 8%. How the hell people are getting anywhere close to 60%, I have no idea.

It's the easiest way to figure out what its worth.
Most people know the value of a dollar based on what it costs to buy groceries, pay rent, and buy gas. If those things become more expensive, then you've suffered inflation and your dollar is worth less.
For bitcoin, there still isn't enough adoption to make that sort of day-to-day comparison a reality. Even when I shop with bitcoin, the stuff I buy is still priced in dollars until I get to the checkout stage.

Ever met anybody IRL that believes odd things? Like faked moon landings, that Hillary Clinton is a clone, chemtrails, and the like?
There is a surprisingly large proportion of the population who are predisposed to believing these sorts of things, and every decently large community is going to have some of these folks. And the nature of bitcoin will appeal to people with persecution complexes, who think the government is after them, etc. So we probably have more conspiracy theorists than your typical community.
rbtc is where the bitcoiner conspiracy theorists go. It's nice to go somewhere where people agree with you.
I'm not sure rbtc is intentionally "hatred and propaganda", although it may seem like it to us. I think they just really believe that stuff, and find comfort in being around other people who do. I've met real far-out conspiracy theorists IRL and they often see non-believers as being in on the conspiracies. Hence the hate.

Rejecting non-SegWit blocks and signalling SegWit blocks only happens once SegWit2x *activates*. In exactly the same way that SegWit has an activation period, so too does SegWit2x. But its activation period is much shorter (336 blocks or 2 and 1/3 days), so is likely to happen before the end of the week.
And just to be clear, what I mean by that is that before the end of the week, SegWit2x is likely to begin *signalling* SegWit (and rejecting non-SegWit blocks). I do not mean that SegWit itself will activate. In fact, it will take 2 weeks for it to lock in, and another 2 weeks after that to activate.
So you have at least a month to wait for something to happen beyond a few bits flipping around in block headers.

This time feels different, though. Very different. Xt, classic, and unlimited never had 80%+ of the hash power committing to running it in a written document.
Many miners feel as if they have the final say on all things bitcoin. And whether we like it or not, this is at least partly true. The miners decide which chain is longest, and SPV clients (which no doubt dominate the system) follow the longest chain. What remains of the minority hashpower chain could change PoW, but the majority hash power chain wouldn't be affected by that change and most people wouldn't see anything more disruptive than the blocks being made at 80% normal speed until the next difficulty adjustment.
By the time it became evident to the community (not everybody browses the reddits) that Bitcoin had been hijacked by a special interest group, it will have been too late.
Unless UASF gets significant economic support, the miners are pretty much the gatekeepers of bitcoin. This was the problem that the UASF was supposed to solve but it doesn't look like it has adequate support.
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:02:59
The miner majority is still required for permanent activation of SegWit. The UASF shuts down in November just as the MASF ends.
The point of the UASF is to encourage support for SegWit during the MASF activation period. The 95% miner threshold is still required in the end. The hope is that the UASF will see the overall community applying serious peer pressure/economic pressure to the miners to signal SegWit for the MASF.

It's a commonly stated misconception/lie that the UASF is a Sybil attack against the bitcoin network.
A Sybil attack is when you manipulate vote counts (eg, upvotes or downvotes) in order to fix outcomes. And by manipulating node counts, and fixating on node counts, you can make that lie seem a lot like truth to people who are new around here. And that's going to be a decent number of people with the price being this high.
But we can't discount the possibility that a very misguided UASF supporter did this as well. People keep fixating on node counts, so it would be very understandable if people were misled into thinking that they were actually important to the outcome.

I've posted a simulation-based method which can be ported to any programming language, and does not rely on statistical functions or factorials. You can find that [here]( It takes less than a second to run in R (which is not particularly efficient) and only needs to be run every block, so despite being a simulation with many iterations, it need not kill your server.
Obviously it needs minor modification to replace some of those magic numbers with smarter values. Maybe run it on a cron job, every 10 minutes. Store the result in a text file.

There are no segwit transactions yet, and there won't be any until it activates, yet antpool and other miners are already putting segwit commitments in many of their blocks. According to xbt.eu it's a large majority of them. 
Are you sure that's the pool software they are running? If so, it's adding segwit commitments for other reasons as well.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:26:46
You seem to have some serious misunderstandings and all I can really do is repeat myself.
NOBODY IS ENFORCING. You can't right now, without forking yourself off the network. Enforcement must be a coordinated event. That's the entire purpose behind bit 4 - miners signal on bit 4, and when a threshold is passed, BIP91 suddenly turns on for 80% of the hash power simultaneously.
You seem to think "enforcing" and "signalling" mean the same thing, They do not. You also seem to think that signalling on bit 1 is required to activate BIP91/SegWit2x. It is not. Signalling on bit 1 is the *outcome* of activating BIP91/SegWit2x.
If miners were running SegWit2x exactly to specification, they would be signalling on bit 4, but not on bit 1. However, miners are entirely within their rights to signal on bit 1 preemptively, and many are doing so. But that doesn't tell you anything about whether or not they support and/or are currently running SegWit2x.
All you need to look at to completely and utterly tear apart your "everyone is signalling on both bits" claim is a block explorer. Which you have obviously looked at. But since you seem to have intentionally left out the mining pools which contradict your claim (which I listed above: BTC.com, ViaBTC, BTC.top, ConnectBTC), it seems to me that you are being deliberately dishonest.

If a bunch of civil engineers told you that a bridge was structurally unsound, would you continue to drive over it if you had another option?
Well, like it or not, a hash power majority and a group of very influential bitcoin business are about to drive over that bridge. The first half, activation of SegWit alone, shouldn't be too bad.
But the activation of the hard fork could be a blood bath. Start getting used to the idea of there being two entirely different bitcoins, folks. The side that loses 80%+ hash power the moment of the fork will find itself with very long block generation time, and months to wait before a difficulty adjustment. It is not going to be pretty.
There is of course the distinct possibility that between now and 3 1/2 months from now, the hard fork itself loses support or has its release pushed to make time for a more careful deployment. We can only hope.

Bitcoin will *always be slow* if you want confirms. That is simply how it is designed. Well, slow is a relative thing. Slow for coffee? Yes. Slow for buying airline tickets? Nope.
Increasing transaction fees make it slower when wallet software doesn't properly present the user with up-to-date fees to select between different speeds of service.
Increasing transaction fees also make it a financial mistake to buy very cheap goods with bitcoin. That includes coffee. The transaction fee ultimately depends on both the current network status and the size of the transaction in bytes. This means the transaction fees will change not just from hour to hour, but will be different for two people trying to send the same amount of bitcoin to the same recipient at the same time and with the same priority of service. That, right there, is usability hell.
Coffee will probably never be purchased directly on-chain by "normal" people using typical one-to-one transactions. But the Lightning Network could make it possible to do that. It's just no longer a one-to-one transaction, and depending on the implementation may require a third party intermediary. That upsets a few people, I guess.
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:05:35
The UASF still requires consensus because it still depends on the MASF for permanent activation. The BIP148 UASF shuts off in November.
If you read the BIP, it's really just a boycott against miners who aren't supporting segwit. Because it ignores their blocks.
It's not a perfect analogy but it's pretty close. No use thinking the world's going to end. It won't. A chain split isn't the best, but I'm not going to lose sleep thinking about it.
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:46:18
It makes no sense to you because you're trying to imagine it as a standalone activation method. It isn't.
It's doesn't replace the MASF - it works in conjunction with it. Starting on August 1st, UASF nodes will reject all non-SegWit blocks. Imagine if BitPay ran the UASF - after the flag day they would be blind to the non-SegWit subset of bitcoin. That would create enormous pressure to make sure your blocks could be seen by BitPay. And that is what is meant by "economic nodes". BitPay is one. Your RPI node is not.
UASF also has an end date. At midnight, November 15th 2017 it turns off. That is also the end date of the existing MASF deployment. So in effect, the UASF creates economic pressure to adopt SegWit during the MASF deployment period. It is still the MASF that will determine if SegWit actually activates permanently.

Every public network system has the same vulnerability at its core, and needs to add limits and filtering on top to try to prevent DoS attacks without catching false positives. That will never work perfectly.
Bitcoin has a bit of a leg up just because it costs money to use. But that also provides a unique way to launch a DoS attack - you can push out certain use cases just by filling up the mempool with transactions whose fees are sufficiently high. And even if they don't confirm (eventually getting your money back), that still achieves the goal... temporarily.
There will be increasing pressure to find ways to improve bitcoin's robustness against DoS attacks... assuming it survives long enough. This is the first time any cryptocurrencies have ever come close to some degree of  mass adoption. Nobody knows what will happen and who will come to oppose it.
I believe that bitcoin is literally one sizeable country's efforts away from being unusable for most people. Let's hope that I'm wrong.

That is irrelevant to segwit signalling, but suggests that these miners are signalling segwit without running compatible node software. This can be called "fake signalling", but BIP91 doesn't actually care. As long as they signal on bit 1, their blocks won't be orphaned. However, if they aren't actually running BIP91/SegWit2x/UASF, they won't be helping to enforce SegWit signalling.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:20:52

Roger Ver has his own poll system on bitcoin.com, which weights responses by bitcoin holdings (you participate by signing a message with your private key) and allows you to mix your coins to vote multiple times.

Afraid the code can't be that simple. SegWit removes the entire concept of block size, replaces it with block weight and two other numbers used to weigh witness and non-witness bits differently. There is a lot of argument still over whether to not only change the block weight limit, but also the way blocks are weighed.

Agreed, but that's a very different situation than "SegWit2x is not released and the miners are running Core+BIP91 (SegSignal)".
Unless miners outright say that's what they are doing, there's no way to actually know, making the comment above perhaps rumor, at best. I was hoping to get a link to a NYA miner tweeting that they were running SegSignal but that hasn't materialized yet. I'm guessing that this is all rumor/wishful thinking. Miners could certainly just be injecting the version bits into core software, though ("fake signalling" as it's been called).

I don't think most people trade based on that kind of thinking. They trade based on emotion and on what the price is doing, regardless of rhyme or reason.
Literally anything could happen. But I do have my own prediction...
I think the price is likely to go up and might surpass $3000 USD just before SegWit activation... and then down a little bit, but not a crazy amount afterwards. If price goes above $3k in the leadup to SegWit activation, it will likely go back down to $3k and linger there for a while as nice round numbers like that tend to obtain psychological imporance, and become relatively strong points of support or resistance. This seems to be the pattern that has occurred for most well-anticipated events that I can recall. There's a reason "buy the rumor, sell the news" has become cliche.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:00:46
Yeah, although the probability of activation is quite high now even without them. Well, I should say lock-in, because there's another signalling period delay even after that before anything happens.
F2Pool is safe even if they don't signal BIP91, because they are already signalling bit 1. Bit bitcoin.com better get its ass in gear or it will have its blocks orphaned. Slush is also safe, since its users can switch to signalling bit 1. I don't think Slush pool themselves even have to do anything.

Attribution is important in science, if for no other reason than it is important to state what ideas are not my own - to cite and reference sources. Use a pseudonym if you must.

It's not a hf to 2 MB. SegWit is already ~ 2.3 MB.
It's a hf to about 5 MB. Luke_Jr would actually call it 8 MB, since blocks could potentially get very close to that by stuffing transactions with witness data.
But IMO, whether that is going to make RPi nodes unfeasible or not is very much a secondary concern to the fact that a small room full of people called the shots here, and then had a *single person* code it up (although, to be fair, he did incorporate code from third party contributors).
They either don't understand the importance of a leaderless dev team when it comes to bitcoin development, or they don't care. Either way, they are using SegWit as a carrot to put development authority into the hands of a very small number of gatekeepers. We'll be far worse off than we ever were *even if* the blockstreamcore conspiracy theories are true.
We should celebrate SegWit activation, but we need to make sure the hard fork truly does represent the will of an overwhelming majority. Not just hash power, but economic majority as well. You shouldn't be half-assing a hard fork. That's how you get a permanent chain split.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:31:08
You buy the rumor/sell the news when the rumor/news is good. Eg: SegWit activation.
When it's bad, you *sell* the rumor and buy the news. Eg: China bans bitcoin for the trillionth time.
Different people will have different ideas of whether these events are good or bad, of course. But aside from a few loud outliers, I think most of us are all for SegWit activation, and not so keen on the BitcoinCash fork. Then there's a 2x fork - but I guess people are going to worry about that later.
With all these competing uncertainties of different magnitudes and levels of goodness/badness, it's kind of hard for me to predict what the hell will happen.
But since SegWit is probably the biggest event any time soon, you might be right. Its activation may influence the market more than other events. But I expect a post-SegWit selloff to be pretty temporary, unless other events cause a more extended bear market.

I like James Hilliard. Quite a bit, actually. I admire his willingness to just write code, put it out there, and let the chips fall where they may.
James Hilliard's contributions were to the variety of activation systems, not to the payload itself which is the real meat of SegWit2x, even if there's more code in the activation system than in the actual protocol changes.
Jeff Garzik decided what code went into the thing, and the agreement ultimate decided (mostly) the protocol changes. So when I say "single person", I mean Jeff. He's the lead dev. And that's a step backwards. Not because it's Jeff, but because there's a lead dev. Bitcoin is better off without development authorities.

Segwit won't lock in this activation period (19) because signalling started too late, but barring signalling shenanigans, it will lock in next signalling period (20)!
For the August 1st "deadline", Segwit will not be locked in yet, so the UASF nodes will start enforcing. But since the miners will have already been doing so, and since everybody will be signalling, the only effective result of this is further pressure for miners not to pull any stunts.

How it is that after all these years, so many people still don't understand what SegWit does?
- Fix for 3rd party malleability
- Linear scaling of signature hashing
- Reduced computational needs for hardware wallets and similar devices that don't have particularly powerful CPUs
- Increased security of P2SH multisig by strengthening the hashing algorithm
- Enabling more complex new scripts by adding version numbers to them
- Encourage transactions that reduce the UTXO set
- Various other efficiency improvements
- And finally, yes, a block size increase... the least important of all of SegWit's features
You can't do all that by changing a single number.


And it definitely wasn't. Raising soft limits was an entirely different situation.

Your client software does not understand the meaning of the bit 4 signalling that is occuring.
You can safely ignore this warning if you are not mining, since bit 4 signalling is not intended to trigger any behaviors on non-mining client software.
If you are mining, you can set bit 1 to ensure that your blocks will not be orphaned by the network, regardless of the outcome of either BIP91 or the UASF.

Bit 4 is not SegWit signalling, in the same way that a caterpillar is not a butterfly. All that matters for SegWit activation is bit 1. Did you account for that in your 60%?
I bring up this technicality because there is still an opportunity for shenanigans even if 100% signal via bit 4...

I can't help but experience the same sentiment as you quite often. But I always figured there would be growing pains. What worries me about the hard fork is the political power grab that it enables.

For those wondering how to calculate the probability, but aren't really into maths, there's always my fall back approach: run a simulation 10k or 100k times and see what proportion of them "succeeded"!
We now need 205 blocks of the remaining 258. Each of the remaining blocks has ~ 80% probability of signalling. Know a bit of programming? Make a loop inside a loop. Outer loop runs a simulation over i iterations. Inner loop runs through 258 blocks, for each generating a random number between 1 and 100, and sum the number of blocks whose random numbers are 80 or less. At the end of the inner loop, compare the number of blocks that signalled to the needed number of additional blocks in the current signalling period (205). If equal to or greater, the simulation is a success  - increment a simulation success counter.
Use the outer loop to run the simulation through 10k or 100k or 1 million simulations (depends on how patient you are). At the end, compare the simulation success counter to the total number of iterations. simulation successes / iterations is the probability of activation in the current signaling period.
Here, I'll do it in R. I personally don't like R, but it's the industry standard in my field for statistics so I have to use it, and have grown somewhat familiar with it... ugh.
    blocksLeft = 258
    sigBlocksNeeded = 205
    
    iterations = 10000
    simSuccessCounter = 0
    
    hashRate = 80
    
    for (i in 1:iterations) {
      blockTestVals = sample(1:100, blocksLeft, replace=T)
      sigBlocks = sum(blockTestVals &lt;= hashRate)
      if (sigBlocks &gt;= sigBlocksNeeded) {
        simSuccessCounter = simSuccessCounter + 1
      }
    }
    probability = simSuccessCounter / iterations
    probability
    [1] 0.6118
So 61% chance.
I am a HUGE fan of simulations, because sometimes you doubt the math and want to check it another way. Want to wrap your brain about the Monty Hall problem? Simulate it. It makes a whole lot of sense very quickly, in a way that few people can put into words.

I expect BitcoinCash to be a non-event (maybe a blip). But since we all get "free" coins on the BitcoinCash network, and a lot of folks are going to sell them, the price of BitcoinCash will likely be very low... and all that selling may trigger a small amount of buying pressure for bitcoin proper. But I will admit, this is somewhat wishful thinking.
 And the 2x hard fork isn't something that feels "immediate", since it's happening in November. Still, I do think the 2x hard fork could shake confidence if it looks like we'll get a permanent split.

Huh, I didn't expect them to signal on bit 1 until SegWit2x locked in via bit 4. Maybe I misinterpreted how the activation worked.
Edit: Nope, BitClub is just doing that for their own reasons. Antpool is not signalling on bit 1 yet. The [version field Antpool is setting]( is 0x20000010. Which is b100000000000000000000000010000
So you can see signalling only on bit 4 (the right-most bit is numbered 0, the next to the left is 1, and so on).
SegWit2x nodes will begin signalling on bit 1 *after* they lock-in with the 80% requirement via bit 4. Looks like the 80%+ is already here, so now it's just the waiting game.
Unless miners go "haha, suckers! Just kidding! We're not actually going to support this after all!" you might as well call it a done deal.

It's kind of going to be hard to tell if BIP148 succeeds or fails given that SegWit2x is muddying the waters by behaving similarly once it activates.
So am I right in guessing that your decision to develop an altcoin is more contingent on what happens with SegWit2x? Like if they actually do hard fork?

SegWit doesn't exist to give you 4 MB blocks (which it doesn't even do in the first place anyway). Core has had a very easy to understand [FAQ on what it does]( up for a very long time. Have you not read it?
- Fix for 3rd party malleability
- Linear scaling of signature hashing
- Reduced computational needs for hardware wallets and similar devices that don't have particularly powerful CPUs
- Increased security of P2SH multisig by strengthening the hashing algorithm
- Enabling more complex new scripts by adding version numbers to them
- Encourage transactions that reduce the UTXO set
- Various other efficiency improvements
- And finally, yes, a block size increase (to 2.3 MB, by the way, not 4)
IMO the block size increase is the least important of them all, and is really just a side effect of how they chose to encourage many-to-few transactions.

All it would require is laziness. False signalling is when they signal bit 4 without actually running the SegWit2x software. Then if activation occurs on the nodes actually running the software, the blocks generated by the "falsely" signalling nodes will be rejected because, not actually running SegWit2x, they won't automatically switch over to signalling on bit 1.
False signalling apparently was the norm during litecoin's SegWit activation... actually posted as much on (and since nobody knew who he was, they thought he was just "concern trolling", lol).
The lock-in period will give miners time to actually install the needed software if lock-in occurs. However, for SegWit2x, that's only a few days. Hard to say if that would be enough time for the more lazy of their numbers.

If I were a merchant selling a relatively cheap product that the buyer wants fairly quickly, I would probably accept the risk of double spends.

I'm not "nervous", I'm utterly perplexed at how you can be so convinced of your statments when they are provably false.

What's with everyone calling it BIP91 instead of SegWit2x? Bit 4 isn't just activating enforcement of SegWit signalling, but also locking in a hard fork. That makes it something unique, and calling it BIP91 ignores that.
I can only assume this is being done by SegWit2x supporters in order to reduce the amount of negativity posted in response.

Before segwit, many of the same people were arguing for 4 or 8 mb blocks. So I've been interpreting their hard fork as "double whatever block size segwit gives us". That's the only way it seems to make any sense.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:18:50
A doubling of capacity is not worthless. Yes, it's a short term solution, but in combination with SegWit it's actually a multiplicative gain to effective block size to just under 5 MB. That's more of a medium term solution, which is good because it's going to take a while for LN to come to a client near you.
I'm actually somewhat opposed to a 2 MB hard fork, but I become less and less so every day. Ultimately, the community should decide. So I say release with the same activation mechanism as SegWit. It probably won't activate for the same reasons SegWit hasn't, but at least we know that if it does, it will truly be a supermajority decision.
I've worked as as developer. Stuff never happens as quickly as you'd hope and LN is a very complex smart contract system. It's going to be a while before it's just being used by hardcore enthusiasts. Quite possibly years.

I have to say, it's refreshing waking up to something that at least on a preliminary glance actually appears to work equally with both sides. I'm curious though. This would seem to lead to a SegWit lock in before the NY agreement nodes go live. Now I assume some signatories only really care about SegWit. Might they pull out of the agreement if they see the opportunity?
If the signatories were all on board with the hard fork, they wouldn't need to reinvent the SegWit signaling and activation system to couple the two things. They'd just roll out the hard fork on its own I would imagine. Unless packaging SegWit in there was not intended to satisfy signatory demands, but to throw the rest of us a bone.

I disagree. It should have already started, and be currently running through the SegWit lock-in and activation phase.
It should be run through the entire process on testnet, and in chronological order, and with a mix of nodes including core/segwit and BIP148 nodes. It should have started with signalling on bit 4, then switching to enforcing bit 1 after activation on bit 4, with traditional core/segwit nodes signalling (but not enforcing) bit 1, and even some BIP148/UASF nodes in the mix, to finally locking in and then activating SegWit... and kept running, 100% of the time, to eventually activate the HF.
It needs to be tested in terms of how it interacts on a highly heterogeneous network during periods of both relative inactivity absolute rush hours. And that takes time.
Time the project no longer has.
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:30:35
Because orphaned blocks essentially get forgotten and don't get recorded in the block chain (unless there are lots of non-enforcing miners), we'd have a hard time telling if blocks were being orphaned unless we ran full nodes and a separate DB to keep track of which blocks arrived, comparing that to what actually ends up in the block chain.
It's easier to tell if a chain split occurs, but a selling feature of BIP91 is that with this much miner consensus, that just won't happen. Unless, of course, miners are not actually running it.
Check  from time to time to see what's going on. It's more likely to come into use during the BitcoinABC/BCC and 2x hard fork, however.

@_date: 2017-05-21 21:20:50
BIP148 is not an activation method. It still relies on BIP 9 and the 95% mining threshold chosen for SegWit to actually lock it in. What it *does do* is boycott blocks that aren't signalling for SegWit, to put pressure on miners to get closer to that 95% threshold.
How does that "completely disregard" miner support? If miners are stubborn and willing to take a financial hit, they can actually fully resist it.
You can read the code for BIP148 yourself if you want. It's like 6 lines long and leaves nothing to the imagination.
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:42:35
That and Antpool isn't signalling bit 1 anyway. SegWit2x as written only turns on bit 1 signalling after SegWit2x locks in via bit 4. Any blocks currently signalling both bits 1 and 4 are doing so at the whims of the node operators.
The block you used as an example above was mined by BitClub. I guess they support a "give us SegWit - we don't care how" approach, haha.
In reality it hardly matters, as you say. But seeing actual bit 1 signalling even this activation period would have a strong psychological effect :)

He provided a straight answer. Took his sweet time at it, but it seems he actually had no idea SegWit had any effect on ASICBoost, which is partly why the miscommunication arose.

As a holder... there's the least risk in taking no stance whatsoever. If there's a chain split, my coins exist on both chains. We can afford to ride this out until the choice looks more clear.
So this decision is only one that needs to be made by bitcoin services, miners, and people who intent to transact during a chain split event.
Unfortunately people are going to continue to use bitcoin during such an event without even knowing that it's occuring. People who don't come to this sub on any regular basis and who expect bitcoin to just work. Those are the people whose losses we should worry about because that is how bitcoin could end up losing its entire security-oriented reputation. Without security, it's nothing at all.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:58:31
Hmm, did you just answer your prior question about why it's considered a vulnerability (allowing an adjustment to the header that reduces effective difficulty)? 
I can see how some folks can justifiable classify it as an "optimization". It's really a matter of perspective. The reason I lean towards calling it an exploit is because it is a partial workaround to a process that is very vital to bitcoin's security. Miners using it are actually forging fake proof of work.
It wouldn't be a problem if everybody used it, but lawsuits have already been threatened. It's patented or at least people claim to have done so, and for that reason, it establishes yet another method by which individuals can gain a monopoly. In this case, it's a *extremely* profitable workaround... as long as very few of your competitors use it. So the pressure to sue them into oblivion over it is going to be high.
Bitcoin and patents should be kept a good distance away from each other.
Actually, scratch that statement about it not being a problem if everybody used it. Even if everybody used it, it still provides extreme incentive to forever prevent changes to the bitcoin header structure that impact the ability to use ASICBoost. So it's providing financial incentive to block changes to bitcoin, even ones that aren't deliberately related to ASICBoost or the blocking of it. SegWit, for example, "fixes" covert ASICBoost even though that was never the goal of SegWit.
The fact that miners are apparently locking in SegWit anyway is interesting. Maybe they aren't using ASICBoost after all. Although I find it very hard to believe they wouldn't leverage such a profitable thing...

Coins don't have unique identities in bitcoin, so no, you can't enforce that. It is transactions that have identities, and sufficient mixing can put enough degrees of separation between two transactions that they won't be particularly strongly connected. That's the entire point of mixing, actually.

We can trade acronyms all night, if that's your game ;)
I'm not convinced that your conspiracy theory has any legs. The devs have entertained a lot of different ideas over the years, and they aren't in control of shit. This tired cliche that github access for a single repo is being used to control bitcoin is just nonsense.
If you want (if you know how) you can write the code yourself. Fork bitcoin, create a new repo, and change whatever you want. Nobody's stopping you. Gavin and Hearn did it. Roger Ver and his devs did it. The signatories to the NY agreement are doing it.
Some of these things even got a modicum of support.
See, it's not the devs who are in control. They can't force people to run their code over everybody else's. The people who are in control are the ones who run nodes and mining rigs. They decide what software to run. And the only reason they currently run bitcoin core software over all other options is because the rest of the ecosystem is a steaming pile of shit. BU is buggy as hell, and Gavin and Hearn said absolutely batshit insane things and alienated most of the community.
Interestingly, the NY compromise is actually somewhat popular and actually has a chance.
There's also the UASF, which is another third party fork of bitcoin. One that is extremely contentious among bitcoin devs. But plenty of people are going to run it anyway.
Because devs don't control shit.

That's right. However do not underestimate the effort required to take a prototype product and turn it into a polished end result.

@_date: 2017-06-09 19:25:26
There is not really such a thing as base block size, either. The mechanism I described, with the weight limit and the weight costs for witness and non-witness data is everything there is determining block size in SegWit.
The 4 byte cost for UTXO (non-witness) data combined with the 4 MU block weight limit means that the legacy portion of blocks produced by SegWit nodes is still capped at 1 MB. This is why it can be a soft fork.
But I see what you're asking. Imagine if the 2 MB hard fork happened *first*, before SegWit. We can call this the "base block size" although at that point, it's really just "block size".
In which case, we might imagine SegWit, if built after a 2 MB block size increase HF, would have used an 8 MU block weight limit instead of 4, resulting in effectively 4.6 MB blocks (double that of the current situation). Although I think it equally likely that core devs would have still set the weight limit to 4 MU, and instead changed the cost of UTXO bytes to 2 instead of 4.
So a block size increase HF proposal might end up calling itself an "8 MWU (million weight unit) HF".
Indeed this seems to be what the name "SegWit2x" invokes as well. They are doubling the capacity *again*, compounding with the doubling provided by SegWit.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:21:58
Maybe an 8M weight limit is reasonable... yet many core devs seem to think it will "destroy bitcoin". Luke Jr said exactly that in a reply to me when I asked whether he'd ever sign his name to such a change.
It's easy to see bigger blocks as a simple solution to on-chain scaling. But other people worry that it will encourage spam, geographical centralization, and make running nodes more of a challenge for home users. Meanwhile many of the big blockers parrot [Gavin's assessment]( that at-home nodes are a waste of resources, and datacenters are where the future's at.
This is a sticky point, and it's one of the things I really struggle to come to terms with.
I want bigger blocks but NOT at the expense of bitcoin's security and decentralization (which it's losing enough already). But I don't know how to predict how big is too big. How do you even run a simulation on that scale, accounting for all the social and technological factors, many of which are moving targets?
@_date: 2017-06-04 23:07:54


Hard to say. If you look at miner signalling it's basically a 3-way tie between SegWit, BU, and either "do nothing" or "something else" (however you want to interpret the act of not signalling).
If you look at opinion among startups and miners [here]( SegWit is winning quit soundly and BIP148 still has a lot of undecided parties.
The fact that these two metrics are so different is just another representation of the impasse between miners and non-miners. It's clear that *something* about the economic incentives differs very strongly between the miner and non-miner groups, because there are enough distinct entities in both groups that they should regress to the mean if economic incentives were aligned.

Edit: [much better evidence of spam](
The mempool dropped on May 20th because that was the start of the weekend. The mempool usually clears considerably on weekends and then rebounds during the week.
You're right, the pattern from late May to June 10th doesn't mesh with my hypothesis. But the market is a very messy thing, and without knowing who those transactions were from/to, we can only speculate. I think that the default hypothesis which makes the fewest assumptions is that the mempool's size is correlated to real market activity. Any sort of conspiracy theory requires more evidence than some conveniently similar dates.
Let's assume the alleged spammer's motive is to try to make it look like bigger blocks are necessary. In which case, why would they stop? SegWit2x still needs to convince a lot of people of the hard fork half of their plan.
Now if you wanted to spam to fill up the mempool, I'd imagine you'd pay the lowest fee that is accepted into it. Because 100k+ transactions with modest fees would be insanely expensive otherwise. I don't see a clear pattern of 0-10 sat/byte transactions, or even slightly higher fee transactions, to suggest spamming was occurring.
Most of the variance appears to occur with transactions that have 120 sat/byte fees and higher. That is consistent with transactions that people actually want confirmed.

If you see where I'm going with my post, you'll see that my point is that, basically, you seem to have won. UASF forced their hand.
And by "you" I mean the people who want SegWit only, no hard fork. If that truly does represent the majority, then that's what's going to happen *even if* SegWit2x gets their activation threshold. Just because the HF locks in doesn't mean that there's going to still be tons of hash power running SegWit2x 6 months later...
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:43:59
I still fail to see the point. Just signalling for BU support with it? Without both incoming and outgoing connections your node is crippled.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:50:13
There's a very convincing argument to be made that blocks will now forever be full, for all time, almost no matter how big they get. Yes, we can imagine that at some point... perhaps in the gigabytes per block... we'd hit a point at which no further use cases would come out of the woodwork. But at that point bitcoin would be a very small number of nodes, highly centralized, running in data centers. It wouldn't be bitcoin anymore.
Fixing scaling is going to require that people change their expectations for how direct, on-chain transactions will be used. A single block chain can't keep track of every single transaction people want to do, and as block size increases progressively more people will want to use it as cloud storage which IMO would be a disaster.
So there are several things which have to come together to make bitcoin scale, IMO. But it won't please everyone because it necessitates saying "no" to certain use cases like, for example, cloud storage.
1. The lightning network, which will allow people to roll multiple transactions together into much smaller numbers of transactions. This is now the only way bitcoin will ever be used for microtransactions.
2. Atomic swaps will allow "altcoins" to become much more of an extended family - essentially side chains that better fulfill some use cases than bitcoin.
3. And yes, a modest block size increase - because even the lightning network and atomic swaps require some on-chain transactions.
I think we can do this - we can satisfy *almost* everyone with "off chain" scaling. Which is a bit of a misnomer, because it's still on-chain... it's just a more coarse resolution.
@_date: 2017-06-22 01:39:46
This is wrong on all counts. SegWit changes how transactions are measured in the first place - from size to weight. Since witness data is heavily discounted in the weight calculation, the effect is that SegWit transactions are not only less "heavy" than legacy transactions, the weight - which will also be used to determine transaction fee - will be about half that of an otherwise identical legacy transaction.
End result: SegWit transactions are seen as being about half the weight of legacy transactions. This means you can stuff twice as many of them into blocks, and they'll cost about half the fees as well. This is on average, so not all SegWit transactions will be this way. Some will be more or less than this "half" average weight.

The fact that there's a huge discrepancy between miner signalling (what you link to) and the overall community's stance *including* the miners (which is what OP links to) is the entire reason UASF supporters exist in the first place.
Miner signalling was a *responsibility* given to miners under the assumption that their economic incentives would align with the rest of the ecosystem. The discrepancy that exists here means the incentives are *not* aligned, and that miner signalling is a broken system.

My economics professor was quite careful to make us understand that concepts like supply and demand make certain assumptions that are often incorrect. One of the assumptions are that supply and demand can both be infinite, and another is that markets are rational. We know that these assumptions are approximately true some of the time, but not where they break down at how this will affect things. This depends on the nature of the market in question.
So we need an experiment to test many of these ideas. An experiment specific to Bitcoin. This is why it will be very good to get SegWit out there and simply see how the market reacts to larger effective block sizes, and then plan from there. I am not content to base decisions on economic theory alone, but having actual data from bitcoin's actual economy, not just on testnet, would be great.
This is why I personally like the idea of some modest block size increase that is unlikely to cause harm purely as an experiment. Maybe SegWit is enough to act as that experiment. Now, SegWit's block size increase only really begins to show once everybody is using SegWit transactions. We'll have to see how long that will take.
If you're right, we should see blocks stay absolutely full, total fees will either stay the same or increase (hard to see them decreasing so long as blocks fill up), while technological pressure on full nodes increases.
It's really that latter point I'm more concerned about. We don't want to make it so that there's only a few hundred full nodes, most run by 1 or 2 guys.

I agree that there's a decent chance the hard fork will lose a lot of support in between now and November (or whenever it's supposed to activate). I can imagine that such a situation would be quite dramatic, however... we're likely to get a chain split purely out of protest, and Jihan has threatened as much.
However, I don't see this killing the demand for a near to mid-future block size increase hard fork, so the battle will not end any time soon.
I'm hoping that if the *need* for such a hard fork becomes apparent, core can get involved and throw in some goodies from the hard fork wish list in there...

The pie chart is deliberately subtracting huge amounts of signalling from various categories in order to make everything add up to 100% when in fact miners are signalling multiple things simultaneously.
One of the rules they seem to be employing is that unless you are signalling BU only, and nothing else, they don't count that as BU.
The entire pie chart really ought to be removed. It's a completely wrong type of chart for that data.

Doesn't matter if it was actually used or not. Bit 4 = BIP91, soft fork only. SegWit2x is not BIP91, because although they are using the BIP91 logic, they've added a hard fork activation to the mix. The fact that SegWit2x used bit 4 means that bit 4 can no longer be used to activate a standalone implementation of BIP91. The SegWit2x team should probably have used a different bit. From what I've read, they should have used a bit reserved especially for hard forks.
All that said, this is not a matter worth getting bent out of shape about on its own. In reality, core devs have raised a large number of issues with SegWit2x. It's really the collection of all these little issues that shakes confidence in the thing from a technical perspective. The soft fork phase of it seems fine enough, it's really the hard fork that may end up being the giant mess.
That and the power grab that SegWit2x represents.

Enforcement hasn't begun yet, so *nobody* is enforcing bit 1. Some are *signalling* on bit 1, but that is entirely irrelevant to BIP91/SegWit2x activation.
As far as miners who are not signalling on bit 1, there are many others apart from Bitmain.
They are: BTC.com, ViaBTC, BTC.top, ConnectBTC, and possibly others. You can see the version bits (in hex format) [here]( But it needs repeating: whether or not they are signalling on bit 1 currently has absolutely no bearing on SegWit2x or BIP91 activation.

Yes, it is very much a REAL block size increase.
Much of the confusion seems to stem from the fact that SegWit *removes* the max block size parameter and replaces it with a somewhat more difficult to understand block weight.
Block weight is unitless and is set to 4,000,000 in SegWit. It's a lot like Ethereum's gas limit in that different types of data cost more. Blocks are "weighed" and if they are below the weight limit, they are fine. UTXO data weighs 4 units, witness data weighs 1 unit.
The theoretical maximum block size then depends on the type of transactions in the block.
If all transactions were nothing but non-witness data, then the max would be 1 MB.
If all transactions were nothing by witness data, then the max would be 4 MB.
Actual transactions have a mix of both, and we can expect blocks that have 100% SegWit transactions to be around 2.3 MB. Double that for SegWit2x as it currently stands.

Neither SegWit nor a block weight doubling are going to kill bitcoin, especially not with an 80% hash rate behind them. If getting them both is what it takes to help bitcoin scale both on and off chain, while simultaneously killing most of the hope that emergent consensus has (which would lead to further miner centralization), then it's worth it, IMO.

There's lots to discuss
- How big
- How to apply it (SegWit makes it possible to apply the same size of block size increase in a few different ways, but the simplest is probably just to change the block weight limit)
- Activation method (you absolutely want a supermajority for a hard fork)
- Whether to use safeguards like wipeout protection, replay protection, and how to deploy them (might require updates to bitcoin before the hard fork itself)
- What else to bundle with the hard fork - might as well make the risk especially worth it
- Timeline for development, testing, release

I think they are talking about the cost to fill up blocks. Theoretically, if I wanted to waste millions of dollars or thousands of bitcoin, I could absolutely fill every single block with spam transactions so that either nobody could use bitcoin at all, or they'd have to pay higher fees than me.
It's a totally different kind of security than that afforded by expensive mining operations, but I get it. It makes sense. If I had the money and desire I could single handedly fill up blocks and make fees skyrocket.
I have to wonder if that's already happening.

There's another possibility: the people who diligently read this forum, github, twitter, bitcointalk etc represent a minority, and the majority just sort of check in once in a while and go "WTF is going on?".

Replace "privileges" with "responsibilities" and you start to get a better understanding of how open source development occurs.
Unlike other open source projects, however, bitcoin is trying to maintain a single implementation of the consensus layer in order to avoid constant and unpredictable blockchain splits. This means that some degree of guardianship is necessary and I think bitcoin core has done an admirable job, mostly. Some members do ruffle my feathers, however, which is why I'm glad there are many of them.
I would be very surprised if core merges the code. The reason they shouldn't do so is pretty simple. Doing so undermines the peer review process. Now all you need to do to modify the consensus is to convince miners, who appear to be about as qualified to review code changes as any other random bitcoiner. And if the devs don't want to be essentially fired, they are forced to merge. This is a precedent that should be avoided.

Folks, zoom out to the 3 month period to see something interesting.
Something happened starting in early May, and whatever that thing is, it started to decline in late May.
Looking at the price charts, this corresponds to a rapid rise in bitcoin price, with the mempool beginning to clear out once price stopped rising (although it remained volatile). Looks like a rapidly rising price greatly increased economic activity in bitcoin and led to the full mempool.
Prediction time: the next time we see a similar price rise as we saw in May, the mempool will clog up once again.

~~If a miner did that, then they wouldn't get SegWit either.~~
~~SegWit2x activation is only for SegWit2x nodes. If you stop running a SegWit2x node after the activation, you get nothing. SegWit2x is not going to activate SegWit on core nodes as well. It doesn't work that way.~~
~~However, if SegWit2x activates, we might expect core to release new node software with SegWit enabled, but no hard fork. We might see something interesting happen in that case...~~
Edit: Just ignore me, sometimes I don't have a clue and this is one of those times.
SegWit2x activates SegWit in two steps. The first step is the bit 4 signalling, which only locks in SegWit2x itself and will have no effect on other nodes. Once SegWit2x is locked in, it begins enforcing signalling on bit 1, which then contributes to activating the existing SegWit deployment on all nodes.
This also means that it's directly participating in the UASF, as well (because it, too, is orphaning blocks that don't signal SegWit via bit 1). Making a chain split a very unlikely event.
Regardless of your feelings on SegWit2x, the implication is clear. Miners will be signalling for the *existing* SegWit deployment AND enforcing bit 1 signalling.
This is a big deal. Very positive development.

If they use SegWit as written by core,  it will be.
If they change it at all, those changes must be carefully scrutinized.
The proposal they linked to uses SegWit as written by core, but it's also worth noting that they only linked to it as an example, and that their actual code is nowhere to be found yet.
Only time will tell. And this is why UASF must still forge on.
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:08:57
No, because maxblocksize doesn't exist in SegWit at all. That said, don't get mad at me quite yet - in spirit, you're right. But I do want to clear up the technical details.
By separating out the witness data, setting a block weight limit of 4MU, and making non-witness or legacy data cost 4U, the non-witness part of the block, or the entirety of a non-SegWit block, is limited to 1 MB. This is how SegWit managed to be backwards compatible.
To double block size under SegWit is very easy. Just increase the block weight from 4MU to 8MU. This is a hard fork, just like increasing maxblocksize, so the hard part is actually the activation system and/or getting consensus to avoid disaster. The effect of doing that would be to allow non-SegWit blocks to be 2 MB, while SegWit blocks can be between 2 and 8 MB depending on the nature of the transactions (likely around 5 MB on average).
While this is easy, it's not the route SegWit2x has decided to take. Instead, they're basically putting maxblocksize back and then using some logic to switch between that and SegWit's system depending on circumstances. I don't understand why, but I guess they have their reasons.

Up until relatively recently (pretty much this year) fees weren't really high enough to cause people to incessantly complain about them.
Now that we're living in that world, expect wallets to get better in that regard.
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:43:51
Why would we activate SegWit and not use it?
Using SegWit transactions is highly incentivized by effective fee discounts. Maybe users running 5 year old wallet software won't upgrade, but exchanges, miners, payment processors... they will. They stand to save a lot of money on fees by doing so.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:38:07
Time between blocks is still 10 minutes. It's only slower if you don't pay through the nose for transaction fees.
But I can see how you and others will see it as being both. A lot of wallet software seems to be utter shite at figuring out a good transaction fee and presenting the user with options to select speed vs cost.
We'll definitely be in a happier place once a scaling solution is adopted. Hardly even matters which one at this point. Give me SegWit. Give me 8MB blocks. I don't care. I'm also starting to care less and less whether the blockchain I use happens to go by the name of "bitcoin". First to figure out a way to scale while remaining decentralized, secure, and having at least some merchant adoption in my country wins my heart, IMO.
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:59:08
It is a block size increase, AND a soft fork, because devs "cheated" by changing the way transaction size is calculated for SegWit blocks. However, for legacy blocks, transaction size is still calculated using the old method. Additionally, the data within SegWit transactions is encoded in such a way that the blocks *appear* no more than 1 MB to legacy nodes, because the witness data is moved into a data structure that the legacy nodes don't even know exists.
The end result really is a block size increase. There are test SegWit blocks on testnet that have exceeded 2 MB in size, but if you gave those blocks to a legacy node it would see it as being 1 MB.
SegWit2x is an additional block size increase. They didn't think SegWit on its own was enough. It's also a soft fork for the first phase, and a hard fork for the second. They had to make it a hard fork becuase the only way to make SegWit blocks even larger (4 MB) via a soft fork is to not count witness data towards the block weight limit at all, which is a really bad idea that could potentially result in some attack vectors.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:53:02
To be fair to those devs, they didn't have the authority to make promises in the first place.

12.5 BTC per block is the current block reward, and the current value of bitcoin is $2400 USD.
So I just assumed that they're probably on thin margins, so income and expenses are likely similar. So I'm back-calculating how many bitcoin's they'd need to mine per month in order to pay the electricity bills and assuming that they're only slightly larger than that in order to turn a profit and pay wages.
It's just a guesstimate.
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:43:16
Things are moving almost too quickly to keep up. Let's see...
Jeff Garzik and James Hilliard make SegWit2x compatible with BIP141 and BIP148. Hell, it's practically another implementation of the UASF at this point, except that it requires 80% signaled support before the UASF kicks in (and, of course, has that hard fork attached to it - so it's certainly not exactly the same).
Meanwhile, Jihan/Bitmain are laying down the groundwork for a way out of the agreement [in this blog post]( by stating that they must evaluate segwit's "patent risk", and consider removal of the block weight parameter as well as witness discounts. 
The rumors are flying around that Jihan/bitmain are going to abandon SegWit2x. They have repeatedly stated they'd be OK with SegWit as long as they eventually got their block size increase hard fork. Now that SegWit2x has actually written the code to do just that, with a big chunk of miner support to boot, Jihan's company has begun to say "well, but... not really what we want after all".
To hell with them. They plan to fork bitcoin and mine their own coin as a contingency against BIP148. Good luck with that, Jihan! I sure as well won't buy your coin.
My allegiance between various compromises, core, and UASF is like a pendulum that randomly gyrates around between them. There are merits in all of those things. But Bitmain is irredeemable.

Luckily we can still run full nodes. And we should make sure that doing so remains a possibility for home users.
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:00:35
We're almost all on board with SegWit. But UASF is controversial because it can negatively affect people who don't want to participate.
I still think it's a good backup plan just in case SegWit2x falls through, but I also have to admit that this is a somewhat risky time for bitcoin and I can understand people who think a UASF is reckless.
You can see in that chat log from the devs that Luke is basically on his own in vocally supporting it. Peter is with him a bit as well, though less vocally, and the other devs just think it's too risky. It seems that the community is equally torn. It comes in waves - there will be periods of time where lots of UASF supporters are posting, other times when it's the other way around.

Nodes can soft fork a block size decrease without miners. It would be a UASF situation of course... with risks.
I don't think we'll need to do this, though. I understand the slippery slope argument, but the hard fork plan so far really doesn't increase block size that much. I think it'll be fine. Nodes will feel it, I'm sure, but not enough to lead to centralization.

I actually think I understand you now.
Your idea would make the poll Sybil proof. You're absolutely right about that.
But it would make it pretty fucked up, as well, from a social point of view. In a poll, you need to find a way of preventing Sybil attacks that is based on the identity of the respondent, for the simple reason that "respondent" is your replication unit. A poll with responses weighted by holdings - assuming it was not selecting a biased population - would still be interesting as a measure of latent economic consensus. But it would no longer be polling the opinions of *people*, it would (in a rather odd way) be polling the opinions of bitcoins.

And you will not even have to update your software (unless it's very old). In fact, only miners need to run BIP91/SegWit2x at this time.

The SegWit side of SegWit2x and SegWit (via core) are the same, yes. 
The way SegWit2x works is really quite genius, IMO. It has a nested activation system and does not re-write SegWit or even SegWit's activation system.
First, the 80% requirement for signalling on bit 4. If they get that 80%, this locks in the eventual hard fork. It also locks in *mandatory signalling* for SegWit on bit 1. Sounds familiar, haha. It's basically BIP148!
This means that SegWit2x nodes contribute to existing SegWit signalling, on bit 1, while simultaneously rejecting blocks that do not. This is the same method as the UASF/BIP148. I never thought I'd see something like this come from the NY agreement, of all things.
Unless something happens, such as miners pulling out of the NY agreement and staying with BU signalling, we're getting SegWit.
And the best part? While SegWit2x nodes lock in the hard fork, the activation of SegWit via the existing deployment mechanism means that nodes can move to core software at any point if they feel the hard fork plan is technically weak or isn't getting enough consensus. Doing so will not adversely affect SegWit activation.
This is a potentially awesome development.
Edit: re-written to remove a lot of misunderstandings on my part (very old info).

Agreed, miners generally run core software and just "fake signal", then upgrade only once lock-in happens. At least that's how it went down with litecoin.
But *someone* is running BU nodes. Probably BU themselves, and maybe some of the more ardent individual supporters. If nobody was running any, there weren't be any BU nodes to crash in the first place.

I actually think Jihan (and others) will mostly stick to their guns on SegWit2x. For the simple reason that they can't blame core this time when the agreement falls apart... nobody from core was involved in the discussion.
If it falls apart, they will have to admit to being the cause.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:45:57
The SegWit2x proposal is mostly just increasing something that SegWit already changes - effective block size. Given that SegWit itself touches a lot of different things, it's not like it was going to be a controlled experiment anyway.
It won't necessarily be forever. It takes a hard fork to increase block size, but you can decrease block size with a soft fork. This is something that Andreas explains quite nicely in that podcast episode on UASF/HF/SF that made it to front page yesterday.
What increase is not harmful? It's definitely not simple. There are tradeoffs that need to be considered. There will be some tradeoff between transaction throughput, transaction fees, spam, full node system requirements, etc that is "ideal" for each use case. And the community will have to figure out which of those use cases are most important. This will also be a moving target as technology marches onward.
You'd measure transaction volume (not number of transactions, but value of those transactions - bitcoin days destroyed is a good metric here because it's robust to people spending the same coins over and over) and average fee per transaction. Deciding what to measure is easy. Deciding what the targets are is the hard part.
What is even desirable? Yup. That's the problem. Digital gold? On-chain Visa 2.0? Settlement for 2nd layers? Everybody wants something different from bitcoin.
IMO we need medium-term on-chain scaling solutions while LN and other 2nd layer solutions are worked on. Contrary to expectations it will almost certain take years still before the 2nd layer solutions are polished and integrated enough to be ready for mainstream use.

The main reason I buy stuff with bitcoin is that it's easier and more immediate than sending a transaction to an exchange, getting them to write a cheque with who knows what KYC requirements, and waiting to see if my bank decides I'm "structuring" or just too much of a risk.
[Posts like this]( are not rare at all, and make me hesitant to ever turn my bitcoin back into fiat. So I stay in the system, at most dabbling in altcoins here and there.
I can't be the only one like this, and it would be very interesting to know to what extent my anecdotal experience applies to other members of the community.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:55:18
I feel that both BTC and ETH are at a make-or-break moment here.
BTC with the scaling "debate" approaching a climax, and ETH exploding into ICO hype that may or may not turn out to be a giant bag of scams.
So my strategy is likely to split half and half into both. Hell, I might even put a third each in BTC, ETH, and LTC.
However, it's often that the entire crypto market goes boom or bust in unison, so even diversifying may not be safe.
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:48:58
Actually, with SegWit there isn't a block size anymore. It's been replaced by a block weight which limits block size between 1 and 4 mb, but doesn't strictly set it. So whatever 2 mb hard fork you're thinking of, it won't work with segwit.
Don't know if you've been following the development of SegWit2x, but they're having to write new hf code. And doing some fucky things to artificially add the concept of block size back into the code without changing SegWit. 
People who think SegWit is hackey ain't seen nothing yet.

Dogecoin got shafted by the collapse of an exchange and still hasn't recovered.
Anyone remember Paycoin?
Cryptos can devalue unexpectedly. Maybe that should actually be *expected* of them. There are too many out there for even a tiny percent of them to succeed.
The difference between a legit crypto and a shitcoin is trust. This is easily shaken by scams, scandals, hacks, and exploits. Bitcoin is still a high risk thing. As I see it the biggest risk, by far, is centralization. This whole scaling debate may make it seem like high fees and full blocks are the biggest risk, but they aren't. Fees are high and blocks are full because bitcoin is popular. The desire for it to scale to things like daily purchases and microtransactions risks pushing it into further centralization, if not handled carefully.

You make some good points. Some of the folks replying to your concerns about lightning seem to have plausible sounding rebuttals - have you looked further into that?  I don't know enough about the tech to comment, myself. To be honest I'm having a hard enough time keeping up with BIP141/148/149/SegWit2x and the seemingly never ending game of chess they're all playing.
I agree, bigger blocks means more use cases. We also get more use cases from other clever ways to use the existing block space more efficiency. So if there's reason to think bigger blocks may somehow lead to centralization (some core devs are practically doomsday prophets on that front) it might be worth examining that choice carefully.
Time may not be as short as it seems. I think the rise of Ethereum has given the situation a hint of desperation. But the rise of Ethereum is riding on the back of a huge upswing in ICOs, which is something bitcoin sucks at doing anyway.
We agree (I think) that what really matters is to avoid alienating use cases if we can avoid it. Maybe we have different opinions on the best way to enable those use cases. Well it really does seem like SegWit will activate this year, so we won't be kept guessing much longer - after some months of SegWit activation I think the debate over big blocks will take center stage. And I really do think that most core devs are reasonable enough that if it becomes clear that bigger blocks are needed, we'll get bigger blocks. Worst case, if it's that clear, the community will move ahead regardless.
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:11:24
Well, it's not that simple, because the extent to which a node is popular (I wouldn't say trusted) can change if they start doing things the community doesn't like.
IMO bitcoin does not really solve the problem with PoW, either. It substitutes having to buy trust through social engineering with having to buy trust by spending money on mining equipment.
In general, resource commitment (which is what mining is) is considered a piss-poor solution to Sybil attacks ([source]( any by extension any other sort of consensus mechanism. Bitcoin hasn't really *solved* the problem, just mitigated it. It's sort of a "good enough" solution, and would work a hell of a lot better if mining was more distributed. It's the distributed nature that makes the consensus at all trustworthy.
Similarly, BIP148 requires quite a few parties to get on board before anything noteworthy happens. So it's still a distributed consensus. People saying it only needs like ~20% hash power are assuming that all many miners will join the bandwagon once they see what's happening. That's far from certain...
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:49:04
These were never limits in the first place. At best, they were loose consensus among miners. But charts will show you that blocks were often above those "limits" even at the time.
The 1 MB limit is an actual limit. There is nothing miners can do to get around it short of forking or mining SegWit blocks.
You're comparing apples and oranges. The only point you can really make is that if block size is increased, we can expect miners to implement their own reduced limits as they see fit. Although 2 MB increase is probably small enough that they won't bother.
Luke has always been a bit out there when it comes to his opinion on block size. But rbtc somehow got it into their heads that he speaks on behalf of bitcoin core. He's one of dozens of devs. The fact that bitcoin core doesn't have a set of talking points that all devs must agree to is something that rbtc doesn't seem to get... or intentionally ignores.
@_date: 2017-06-18 02:25:41
Bitmain has been acting funny with their blog posts, suggesting they wouldn't activate segwit unless it had changes. I guess this reaffirmation puts those fears to rest. Maybe. I won't believe anything they say until July when they plan to start signalling SegWit.
@_date: 2017-06-11 13:41:58
Bitcoin is at capacity. Blocks are full and fees often increase steeply at times because people are competing for block space.
Almost everyone agrees that something can be done about this, to give bitcoin more throughput. The problem is that there isn't quite as much agreement on *how* to do this.
There are several competing ideas (worth nothing that NONE of them are mutually exclusive):
- SegWit, which actually does a lot of things, but one of the things it does is ditch the concept of block size entirely. It takes a page from Ethereum's book, creating a "block weight limit" which is like Ethereum's "gas limit". Different types of data in bitcoin transactions have different weights. The result is an estimate of 2.3 MB blocks, which is just over double what we have now. Unlike Ethereum, however, the block weight limit is fixed. SegWit also enables much safer 2nd layer solutions, such as time-locked contracts, which can enable payment channels that greatly diminish overhead for many types of transactions. An example of this is the lightning network. This is a **soft fork**.
- A simple block size increase. This can be done pre-SegWit or post-SegWit and is compatible with all other solutions as well. This is a **hard fork**.
- "Emergent consensus", which is a fancy name for letting miners vote for changes to the block size. If combined with SegWit, miners would actually vote for changes to the weight limit, making the system almost exactly identical to Ethereum's. This is a **hard fork**.
- Automatically scaling block size, such as by increase block size if they are more than 75% full on average, and decrease block size if less than 75% full on average. This is a **hard fork**.
So, soft forks and hard forks. A soft fork is backwards compatible at least to some extent, making it easier and less risky to activate. Even after SegWit activates, old nodes are not required to update immediately. It is a more forgiving change to bitcoin. A hard fork is a change that is not backwards compatible. If you don't update, you'll find yourself on a totally different bitcoin network consisting of all the other people who didn't update. To the extent that some of these people can *refuse* to update, this can create a permanent chain split. So there is risk involved, but perhaps some of the risk is overblown (this is arguable, however).
Bitcoin core wishes to avoid a hard fork, and so prefer SegWit as as scaling solution. SegWit also does many things, such as various fixes for minor exploits, so scaling isn't the only reason to activate it.
Because of that, and because bitcoin core is traditionally the official bitcoin client, SegWit has attracted a large amount of support. However, it is not attracted enough support to actually activate it.
The bitcoin core side blames its opponents for stalling activation of a scaling solution, while the other side blames bitcoin core for not providing the scaling solution they want (they might want emergent consensus, just a block size increase, or some combination of things which bitcoin core isn't considering).
The reason SegWit hasn't activated despite a lot of support is because it relies on a 95% miner-activated threshold. Meaning that 95% of the hash power has to signal that they support SegWit. So far, only 30% has. Contrast that with SegWit's apparent popularity in non-mining areas of the bitcoin ecosystem, and it seems like miners are not doing a very good job acting as our representatives.
Enter BIP148. A highly controversial plan to force the will of the people onto the miners by boycotting those miners who aren't signalling for SegWit activation. It also has aspects of a revolutionary war, and because it effectively creates a subnetwork that won't accept blocks from non-SegWit-supporting miners, it has the potential to split bitcoin into two networks... a "chain split". This has some people worried but it's happened to bitcoin before, and it happened (permanently) to Ethereum (hence why you have Eth and Eth classic).
BIP148 can also cause a wipeout of blocks on the legacy chain at the moment of its victory. In which case some transactions will be erased from history, causing potential losses of both bitcoin and products/services exchanged for bitcoin.
Despite the risk, miner's lack of agreement on any scaling solution (except maybe SegWit2x, but that's a whole other mile-long post) and apparent disconnect between what they want and what the rest of the community wants has led many people to consider BIP148 a necessary action.
It activates on August 1st.
So now that you're down the rabbit hole, there's even *more* reading you can do about these things. Just browse the forum and/or Google. Have fun!

What I hope for, personally, is that a time will come when it really isn't necessary to sell bitcoin for fiat anymore. When goods and services are much more commonly sold for bitcoin directly. That's the dream, anyway.

Each LN payment channel will require at least 2 transactions, maybe 3 or 4 or some small number more for anti-fraud stuff.
But the idea of LN payment channels is to allow hundreds or thousands or even more transactions to move across them. All for the cost of those 3 or 4 on-chain transactions.
So, not particularly helpful for 1-off p2p payments. 
But, imagine this scenario - a payment channel between exchanges and BitPay. A payment channel between miners and exchanges.
That will alleviate a lot of congestion.
Although if blocks empty/fees get low new users/use cases will arrive to fill them up again. Rinse and repeat.

Would you consider writing a post-SegWit hard fork BIP that increases block weight to 8M, with a miner activated system that requires a suitable supermajority and permits early activation if support shows up quickly?
AND signing your name to it?
It's just a BIP, and won't go anywhere without the community. But it will demonstrate a willingness to let the community decide. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:38:29
How often do you expect people to transact with bitcoin?
If it's rarely, if the fees don't bug you (or, more accurately, don't bug your clients), and waiting for however many confirms you want doesn't bug you, you could consider just accepting it straight up without any payment processing service.
Do you do your transactions in person? It's definitely easiest that way because you want to be able to link a specific sale to a specific transaction. If you just put a QR code on a website you'll get payments and not know who they came from (which is one thing BitPay helps you solve).
Or if you have the skills, you can create a system that gives each buyer a unique destination address and stores this public key along with their purchasing details in your database.
Eh... maybe just use bitpay, haha.

Well, no matter what, it's very good that you are making your own decisions. Running BIP148 will help, assuming your node is fully validating and processes occasional transactions.
Sadly, I can really run a node here. Although we're on OK internet, its shared and my housemates would not enjoy me using up that much of the bandwidth. All I can really do is decide which vendors/wallets/exchanges to support, but I guess that's still something.

I suspect the mempool fills up when the price fluctuates because people are trying to get their coins onto/off exchanges in time to trade the volatility.

The last time this question came up the general conclusion was that since SegWit fixes the problem (well... for SegWit blocks), it isn't necessary.
But I'm not sure I buy that, since it still leaves legacy blocks open to covert ASICBoost. Maybe it's just that it's taking time. Nothing development-wise happens quickly in bitcoin. But to see that there's not even a BIP yet... odd.
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:28:20
Yeah, I'm with you. If they pull off this HF without experiencing any technical screwups I'll be a bit surprised. Although they can make the HF very simple if all they do is change the weight limit. But it sounds like that's not all they want to do... they also want to change the base block size limit so that legacy blocks can be larger as well. IMO that makes relatively little sense but I guess they disagree.

You should read the article. It's warning us of blocksize creep and the danger this poses to full node decentralization. I think we can agree that anyone who says it's fine if full nodes are only run by corporations, in data centers, can't be taken seriously. However, the article does say that the layer 2 solutions will require a modest block size increase. It's not explained what "modest" means. The point is this - resist block size increase, don't give in to flawed arguments about bigger block solving all problems. But some small increase may still be very desirable.
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:17:59
Yes, that's true, and it'll suck for a minority chain. It's also why UASF needs much more support (barring SegWit2x making their deadlines) to be effective.
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:32:55
My *opinion* is that we're already too centralized when it comes to mining effort, while the situation with full nodes and dev leadership seems acceptable. The mining situation was once arguably much worse when Ghash.io had more than 50% of the hash power. I say *arguably*, because Ghash wasn't in the business of manufacturing ASICs as well.
Everybody will have their own rather fuzzy level of acceptance here. If part of the bitcoin ecosystem becomes centralized enough that it bothers enough people, there will be pushback.

I can understand the confusion in this case.
For a long time they've been talking about this 2 MB block size increase hard fork. On its own this makes sense. If SegWit didn't exist, a "2 MB block size" would be completely unambiguous.
But when combined with SegWit, it's vague as hell.
Some people interpret it as applying only to legacy blocks, because SegWit blocks are already up to ~2.3 MB. Other people, including Jeff it seems, has stopped saying "2 MB" and started saying "2x" which seems to suggest that it's a doubling - 2 MB for legacy blocks, ~5 MB for SegWit blocks.
But the agreement wasn't for "2x", it was for "2 MB". So it's unclear still which of the possible interpretations are agreed upon *especially* since Garzik has seemingly used Luke Jr's code which only increases legacy block size, and then says 'witness scale factor' TBD.
I am starting to get the sense that the signatories to the agreement were also just as confused on this point.
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:53:35
Bitcoin core devs do have a scaling solution. And if you want to see how "strangely coherent" it really is, look at all of the BIP 10x appearances on GitHub. It's clear that they spent a lot of time arguing, with individual devs pushing their own pet solutions, long before SegWit in its current form was settled on. People complain about how long it's taken them to get anywhere. That's partly why. Slower progress is the cost of not having a centralized development authority that can force a unified action. The scaling debate we're having right now? That's the same debate the devs had to have on their own time, between themselves. See how long it's taking us to find common ground? Be glad it didn't take them as long.
Now the delays are on our shoulders, because while the devs found common ground, we still haven't. Miners refuse to adopt EITHER SegWit or Bitcoin Unlimited. These delays are due to us users/miners, not the devs.


Up until recently it really was. Setting up a full node or even just trying to use bitcoin core as a wallet is just a horrible user experience the first time. Waiting 2 days to download and synchronize the blockchain? It sucks and it's partly why I haven't run a full node in years.
High fees and a mempool backlog are more recent problems. Maybe Greg is having to reconcile hearing years of complains about d/l and sync time with only a few months of "fees are too high!" and "my transaction isn't even in the mempool".
Also, you can single out individual devs, and definitely some of them get under my fingernails at times, but bitcoin core being design by committee means that it is robust to the quirks and oddities of individual people. Hell, Luke wants blocks to be smaller and rbtc LOVES recycling that sound byte. But it won't happen because he's one of many devs. Be thankful of that.
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:09:29
A bit of a flawed analogy, although I do see where you're coming from. Bitcoin has always had multiple potential use cases. Some have definitely been rendered impossible. At least for now.
Those of us who joined the community around 2014/2013 or even before had a very different front page, let me tell you. We're just waxing nostalgic about the old days, when everything up to and including p2p microtransactions still seemed possible.
We still focused a lot on the price but these days it seems that's been taken to the extreme. It's a bit worrisome to see bitcoin most frequently talked about merely as a way to make more USD or to make investors happy.

I don't have the technical understanding to counter you at this point, as I'm not a bitcoin dev. But I hope you will keep an open mind.

Bitcoin's network effect was stronger in 2013. It massively dominated the cryptocurrency scene. Bitcoin's hype was stronger in 2013 - blocks were nowhere near full so people were imagining every use case under the sun, including tiny microtransactions.
And yet, 2013 was the beginning of a VERY lengthy bear market.
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:44:54


Be aware that a "hard fork to 2 MB" is a highly ambiguous statement once SegWit activates.
This is the cause of at least some of the confusion and mistrust between the two parties. At best, it makes the people proposing it look a bit clueless and perhaps not the kind to be trusted to mucking about with the code in the first place.
SegWit does away with the concept of block size. There is now a "block weight" limit, which is 4 million "units" under SegWit. Each byte of block data counts differentially towards the block weight limit depending on whether it is UTXO data or witness data. UTXO data costs 4 units per byte, witness data costs 1 unit per byte. If you add it all up for the entire block, and it's greater than 4 million units, the block is too big.
This means that post-SegWit block size is not directly set, but is a consequence of not only the block weight and and relative costs of UTXO and witness data, but also of how people are using bitcoin (what types of transactions they are doing). Witness heavy transactions will cost less relative to UTXO heavy transactions.
The current estimates are around 2.3 MB per block, effectively, but are subject to change just based on what kinds of transactions occur. Theoretical maximum is 4 MB but would require that all transactions were 100% witness data which is obviously unrealistic.
Any hard fork that adjusts block size in a post-SegWit world must therefore make two things very clear: what is the new block weight, and what is the new ratio between witness and UTXO data (if changed).
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:50:27
It's still much safer as a soft fork because new nodes will be able to relay legacy blocks and transactions. Under a hard fork, the new nodes would be told that legacy blocks and transactions are outright invalid.

The ironic thing is, the current SegWit2x proposal, assuming it activates, will also be enforcing mandatory SegWit signalling on bit 1. That is how BIP148 works. That is how they intend to avoid the chain split... by joining the movement.
And although this seems ironic, it actually fully works with their charter. The first step was always about activating SegWit, and the sooner they activate SegWit, the sooner they activate their precious hard fork as well (which *will* split the chain, no doubt).
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:14:25
Yes, **if** SegWit2x makes its deadlines.
In which case, you will see actual, real SegWit signalling appear rather suddenly, and all at once, in late July.
They're really cutting this one close, because their goal is to prevent BIP148 from causing a chain split.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:33:23

It was a long time to hold. Almost gave up on it a few times. But always reminded myself that MtGox didn't expose any fundamental weaknesses with bitcoin itself (even though Mark loved to blame transaction malleability).

@_date: 2017-06-18 13:52:51
If SegWit2x achieves its timeline, the BIP148 chain will have more than 80% of the hash power.

@_date: 2017-06-15 21:23:49
It could happen, but it would certainly be going back on their word and they'd be hated by other miners for doing it.
Once SegWit activates there will be many months of waiting before the HF does as well... it may be tempting for those people who already got what they want to swap back to core nodes. And if just one big name does it, and the HF looks way too risky because of low consensus, many others will follow.
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:48:24

@_date: 2017-06-13 14:28:22
If you're saying we need multiple planned block size increases in the future (I might agree), then a simple block size increase hard fork is probably a bad idea.
Each hard fork carries risk. Given that there's a possibility that multiple such block size increase hard forks may be desired by the community, the first step in my mind is working on methods that enabler safer deployment of hard forks, as well as some method for the community to better communicate with bitcoin core about what BIPs we'd like to see actually released. Maybe even research into a robust (not miner-centralizing) variant of emergent consensus... 
And IMO this either needs to be done with core development support, or at least peer review.
There are ways for the bitcoin community to reach some sort of consensus, I'm sure if it. The question is whether that will happen in time to prevent a mass exodus.
IMO, people can greatly expedite the process by signalling SegWit. Core devs are not unreasonable. Community pressure, real-world data from a post-SegWit activation, etc will bring them around **if** 4 MB+ blocks really do seem necessary.
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:23:16
Don't know if you've noticed, but we see the problem too. But rather than just dismiss bitcoin, we're trying to do something about the problem before it balloons. This has happened before with Ghash.io, although they were more rational and voluntarily took actions to reduce their domination of bitcoin's hash rate.
I'm curious as to whether you support some particular altcoin. I ask because this problem can happen to any of them. Unless some additional technological breakthrough is found, the only solution is being vigilant and breaking out the pitchforks when anyone gets too much of an upper hand.
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:32:33
Covert ASICBoost is still possible after SegWit activation, but only in non-SegWit blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:48:33
It's going to remain an abstraction for a while still. The theory of how it operates is there, but in order for it to actually exist it needs to be adopted by bitcoin exchanges, service providers, wallet software, and so on. And it's a reasonably complex smart contract system that needs to be well tested, I'm sure. Won't happen overnight. That said, there has been some LN development for LiteCoin (although the use case doesn't really exist for it since it's well below capacity) so maybe that'll help things along.
Thankfully SegWit alone provides a little bit of relief. We'll see if those blocks fill up instantly as many people expect - they will at first no doubt (because of a full mempool) but whether things catch up or not is uncertain. The SegWit2x proposal will be a more medium term solution for sure, but there's a lot of pushback against it. All they need to do to address most of the naysayers is to ensure the SegWit signalling is compatible with the existing deployment, and to push the hard fork maybe to 12 months later instead of 6. I know that sucks because it delays a likely helpful block size increase, but I do think it's important to use that time to rally as much mining consensus as possible (100% of the hashrate if you can) to avoid a chain split when the hard fork activates.
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:10:52

@_date: 2017-06-19 12:04:22
Don't assume exchanges, miners, and payment processors have some allegiance with bitcoin core. They're in this for the money.
The hard fork may well be a failure, but not because of technical problems. BU implements a lot of new stuff... this hard fork is changing a few numbers. Can't really compare them. If it's a failure, it will be because signatories pull out of the agreement after SegWit activates. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:49:48
The hard fork is a separate thing. Anything could happen there.
However, technically speaking, this signalling on bit 4 does lock-in the hard fork (if it passes the 80% threshold). Whether or not that actually happens in the end... well, lots of people think it won't.
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:12:48
Haha, if Jihan really is using ASICBoost, he's likely to pull out of SegWit2x after he figures out/engineers a face-saving way to do so.
SegWit2x will stop ASICBoost because it uses exactly the same SegWit that core clients do.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:49:54
Transitioning to SegWit transactions is highly incentivized as they would be cheaper - the witness data gets heavily discounted when calculating the weight of the transaction, so they'd end up being something like half the price (in fees) of a legacy transaction.
Pretty sure people would be jumping on that pretty quickly. The people who didn't would be the militant anti-SegWit crowd, plus people who only transact occasionally. Anybody who transacts regularly, including exchanges and payment processors and such, would be absolutely insane not to make use of SegWit.
So I think we'd see fairly rapid adoption of SegWit. But it's hard to say. What proportion of bitcoin's transactions are made up of one-off transactions by people who don't bother to keep their software up to date? That's the question.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:09:37

It depends entirely on how they are running servers. I worked for a company that literally had refitted desktop PCs in an air conditioned room running their website. I worked for another that rented colocation services. Neither of those approaches would handle sudden intense spikes in traffic.
Database systems have limited read/write capacity and the only way to improve that is to cache data like crazy or increase the number of or power of the servers. Hard to cache stuff, though, when your services is expected to provide low-latency, up-to-the-minute prices and trades. So when they get a spike in traffic it's basically like a DDoS from their point of view.
And because you can't anticipate the spikes, you need to buy extra servers to handle possible spikes in usage, which sit there below capacity most of the time. It's extra money, extra maintenance, and they might not consider it worth it.

Not sure where you got that impression. All of that still needs to settle on the block chain. only way to get infinite scaling is infinite block size and infinite bandwidth and infinite hard drive space, which I'm sure we can all agree is crazy.
Worth noting that Ethereum supporters claim that they also have infinite scaling, because they have emergent consensus. We'll see how that turns out... my own predictions here are "not good".
That said, we don't need infinite scaling to be globally disruptive. Just need *enough* scaling.

It's going to be *extremely* interesting to compare various mining pools' hash rate (and whether they mine SegWit blocks) before and after SegWit activation.
Nobody knows if covert ASICBoost is actually being used, but we're about to find out. That's one motivation that might explain the hostilities.
Of course the other is just plain old power play.

Seems we're getting SegWit with or without the HF. The HF must be good enough to stand on its own legs, without relying on the promise of SegWit to prop it up. The changes recently made to SegWit2x make it more likely that the HF will be evaluated on its own merit, so I'm in a wierd place of being happy enough with SegWit2x while still being a bit skeptical of the HF plan.
It's not a 2 MB HF anymore, by the way. SegWit removes the concept of a block size and replaces it with a system that is similar to Ethereum's gas limit. The increase will have to be a doubling of the existing "block weight" limit, and will result in ~ 5 MB blocks. This is why they stopped called it SegWit2MB very quickly and started calling it SegWit2x.
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:46:33
That's true. BIP 149 is also a UASF, and the core devs seem in favor of it as the next attempt after the existing SegWit MASF.

Based on a signalling hash rate of 88.7% (which is where we stand now that F2Pool has joined the party), the probability of BIP91 lock-in this period is 99.9%.
This is based on a 100k iteration simulation. The code is below. You can also use a cumulative binomial distribution to arrive at the same results, and there's a redditor who has been doing this (paging The code is written for R, which is an open source statistics package.

      # generate blocksLeft random numbers between 1 and 1000, store in a vector
      # each random number represents a block
      # the value of the random number determines if that block signals BIP91 support
      blockTestVals = sample(1:1000, blocksLeft, replace=T)
      
      # count how many of the simulated blocks are signalling for BIP91
      sigBlocks = sum(blockTestVals &lt;= hashRate)
      
      # if the number of simulated blocks signalling for BIP91 is at least equal to sigBlocksNeeded
      # consider this simulation to be a "success"

There's a caveat, of course... 2 MB blocks (effectively) only exist in the situation where every single transaction is a SegWit transaction. Since that will take a while (everybody has to update their wallet software), the transition to 2 MB blocks may actually take a long time. It may be slow enough that blocks stay full the entire time. However, blocks being full should put pressure on people to use SegWit transactions to get that discount. Making your transaction a SegWit transaction will directly reduce your fees. So maybe I'm wrong - maybe everybody will move over to it very quickly.
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:15:34
Na, there really isn't a string attached. You don't have to run SegWit2x to benefit from its SegWit signalling.
That's the whole point I'm making above. That's what's so interesting about recent developments.
They're planning to prevent BIP148's possible chain split risk by JOINING the enforcement of SegWit signalling, so that it has an overwhelming majority.
If that's not a win, I don't know what is. No guarantees if miners pull out of SegWit2x, however. The best laid plans can still go tits up.
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:33:52
And yet as far as I can tell, hash power has barely changed. Assuming electricity was the biggest part of their monthly expense, and based on current price of bitcoin with 12.5 BTC per block, they would have to find only 6 blocks per month to actually make a profit. Maybe 7 or 8 if employee wages and monthly equipment costs were quite high. And that ignores profits from transaction fees.
Puts that in perspective, eh? On that back-of-the-envolope calculation it might have actually be a very small mining operation.
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:28:04
Maybe... rumors are that Jihan/bitmain will pull out of the agreement and forcibly fork bitcoin and start mining said fork, in which case SegWit2x will no longer have the hash power to activate.
If those rumors are true, we'll have to see what the remaining parties to the agreement do.

I first heard about it when the price was like $5. My thoughts at the time were "well I don't want to by drugs, so why would I want to buy bitcoins?".
I later bought in at $300 when it became clear that this was about more than drugs.
There's still the possibility of quite a lot more upside, but with the possibility of not one by TWO chain split events in the near future, who the hell knows what will become of bitcoin. Could be the end. Could be just the beginning of something truly transformative.

I'm curious if you have data backing that up.
Last i heard, dark markets are moving to altcoins.
The only things I've ever actually spent bitcoin on were expensive purchases from Newegg. People are also getting Amazon gift cards, steam purchases, etc. I wonder if you aren't seeing the full picture of adoption, here. I'm sure drugs still make up a lot of it but I wouldn't be surprised to find out otherwise, either. There's also online gambling and purchases of things which aren't drugs, but carry privacy implications... VPN service, porn, etc.
It really seems like your conclusions come from your own personal experience. As anecdotal as my own, yet we'd write two entirely different articles.

That's surprisingly low, actually. I could see Bitcoin getting to that point one day for sure.


I wonder what makes the difference between theory (7 t/s) and practice (3 t/s)? Maybe there's a way to bring the practice closer to the theory?
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:07:58


We *will* need to increase block size. This has nothing to do with low confidence in L2 solutions. In fact I'm so confident they will work as planned that they will attract more adoption to Bitcoin, thus making it just as congested as ever. It's like building a road network... the utility of having a car rose as the world started to connect cities with highways. Traffic congestion didn't get better, but the utility sure as hell did.
L2 solutions will add on-chain demand. Take lightning network as an example. It requires an on-chain transaction to open, then anti-fraud transactions at irregular intervals. If LN works as advertised, it will enable extremely rapid transactions with very low fees, enabling use cases that are currently impossible, such as microtransactions. That will increase demand and that includes demand for block space.
The spurious argument is saying that we need one solution over the other. We need both. With both, people get to have their digital gold while other people get to buy cheap shit online. It's a win-win.
SegWit enables (but doesn't actually provide) L2 solutions, while directly providing some immediate L1 relief. SegWit abolishes the old block size limit, replaces it with a unitless limit remiscent of Ethereum's gas limit, and weighs transactions based on not just the amount, but the type of data they contain. Typical transactions we see today would give us a block size of 2.3 MB.
Maybe a 2.3 MB average block size is less than you hope for, but both of us are going to get nothing at all unless we find a lowest common demonitor that we agree to.
The bitcoin community is like a bunch of hikers who refuse to take the first step because they disagree on how long their strides should be. It's madness.
I suspect that after SegWit activates, the debate will *immediately* shift to a block size increase hard fork. We'll have a clearer picture of the necessity of that once SegWit activates. We'll all be in a better frame of mind to talk about it, too. Some of the changes made in SegWit, as well as others which have been proposed since, will actually make hard forks much safer. You shouldn't be surprised to see devs relax their stance against hard forks in the future.
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:30:54
[Here's another way to guestimate]( that more or less agrees with your estimate that this was a small mining operation.
The biggest assumptions I made:
- Mining has very narrow profit margins due to difficulty adjustments, so gross income is unlikely to be much higher than expenses
- Mining operators don't pay very high wages or employ relative few people
- Cooling was not a huge expense

~~BIP91 still only signals on bit 4, but will accept blocks that signal on bit 1, and will also act similarly to the UASF by rejecting non-SegWit blocks. As far as I can tell, this UASF-like action of BIP91 is the only thing that may actually push the existing SegWit deployment over the 95% threshold.~~
Edit: more accurate to state that signalling on bit 4 only serves to activate SegWit2x itself, which then goes on to enforce signalling on bit 1. is right. If this PR is merged, the UASF will end up becoming the sheriff of a town with no criminals. And Jeff Garzik seems on board, too.
I'm still a bit too hesitant to outright call this "moon". It seems too good to be true. But at the very least it's a large asteroid. It could still go wrong if miners refuse to run it. I hope they don't, however.

There's also a voting page on bitcoin.com where people can use their private key to sign messages in support of/against UASF, Core, and SegWit. The number if bitcoins at addresses that signed for/against and summed up. The idea I guess is to measure economic consensus.
Three problems with that...
1. A single person with lots of coins can dominate the narrative. That's not really economic consensus. Holding a giant stash does not make an economy. Economic consensus is based on transactions.
2. You can vote multiple times by mixing your coins
3. SegWit (at least right now) invalidates the standard used to sign messages with your private key... soo... it will only be the people not running SegWit who control the narrative there.

I occasionally swing trade but keep my coins in offline storage between trades (since a few hours delay isn't really a big deal when swing trading).

Their motivation is quite clear - they want to be able to track all transactions, pin them down to person x buying y from business z. Not just to prevent money laundering, but also to give them more tools to use to crack down on tax evasion.
Cash, bitcoins, gift cards... those things get in the way. The government can absolutely stop circulating cash. They can regulate gift cards into non-existence. Same with prepaid phones.
But bitcoin is out of their reach because it is global and if needed can be run purely through volunteerism. That said, its corporate side is vulnerable. If you run a bitcoin business in the USA, consider your options for relocating.

For all we know Satoshi is still involved in bitcoin development, just not by that name.
What's important is the merit of the idea, not the identity of who published it. So if the authorship may influence public perception of the idea, then the identity of the authors should be hidden.
Satoshi has accumulated a personality cult, and so anything published under that name (assuming it can be proven the authorship is legitimate) would be given a very different treatment than exactly the same thing published by any of the current bitcoin dev personalities.
If Satoshi were still posting under that name, bitcoin would absolutely be more centralized because of the authority people would vest in him. For bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency whose goal is to remove the need for trusted third parties, this sort of leadership centralization is bad, even when the authority is benevolent/genius/defers to community feedback. A benevolent leader sets up the expectation that bitcoin should have a leader in the first place, and opens up the possibility of a future replacement who ends up being a walking disaster.
Satoshi did bitcoin a massive service to us by allowing his authoritative rule over bitcoin to give way to the loose association of bickering devs we have today. And if he's still active under a different name, shit. Props to him for not abusing the name Satoshi to force things through.
That said, there are days I'd wish he'd say something about the scaling debate. I wouldn't even care what method(s) he favored because I'm confident that his conclusions would be well reasoned. But again, that could lead to an expectation of bitcoin having a leader, and we want to avoid that. If Satoshi ever uses that identity again, he will have to be very careful what he says.

The guy's question translates to "does SegWit2x have hard fork code yet?". That's what "baked in" means. It's a simple question with a simple answer, and the answer is "yes".
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:39:37
Well that's going to take some explaining. I don't know how much you already know, so I will start at the beginning. I still assume you know the basics of bitcoin - if stuff below doesn't make sense you can have a look at the bitcoin wiki, or listen to some let's talk bitcoin podcast episodes, etc.
There's this thing called SegWit (Segregated Witness) that decreases the amount of data that needs to be stored on the blockchain, fixes exploits called 3rd party transaction malleability and covert ASICBOOST, and improves performance of certain kinds of transactions to reduce concerns over denial of service attacks. Because of all of these fixes, it also opens the door to bunch more innovations in the future. And it's being put forward as a scaling solution to help bitcoin cope with the fact that it's currently at max capacity.
SegWit has majority support (but not complete consensus) among non-mining users - validating nodes, exchanges, users, etc. But it only has about 30% of mining hashpower supporting it. Because of the way SegWit is being activated, it requires 95% mining hashpower support before it turns on.
The disconnect between miners and everybody else has caused concern. Giving miners the power/responsibility to make decisions on our behalf (such as whether SegWit turns on) was done so with the assumption that their economic incentives would be the same as those of any other bitcoin stakeholder. The disconnect means that, for whatever reason, their economic incentives are very different than those of the majority of non-miners.
Well, a solution has been proposed. On August 1st, a group of bitcoin enthusiasts and businesses intend to force miners' hands. These users are running a validating node alteration called BIP148, which most people will refer to as UASF (user activated soft fork).
UASF is effectively a boycott that will refuse to validate blocks produced by miners who don't support SegWit, with the idea of getting the miners to support SegWit in order to escape the economic pressure put on them.
But the UASF may result in an event called a "chain split" as well as a "wipeout" of blocks on the legacy chain. If UASF fails outright, there are no problems. If UASF gains tons of support and succeeds quickly, again there will be no problems. The problems arise if the UASF gets enough support to be noticeable, but not enough to resolve the dispute. This situation can lead to a permanent chain split, creating two separate bitcoins. Bitcoin has never seen this before - it once experienced a *temporary* chain split, but that's it. Ethereum experienced a permanent chain split, resulting in the existence of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.
Whether you consider a chain split to be a major problem is up to you. I personally don't think it will be a huge deal on its own.
A wipeout of blocks on the legacy chain, however... that is what I'm worried about. People who are oblivious to what's going on stand to lose their bitcoins, and/or products/services they sell for bitcoins that magically vanish some time later. Transactions that were valid/confirmed for many blocks on the legacy chain can literally disappear. This has people worried.
UASF either needs a ton of support before August 1st... or people need to abandon it. Otherwise there will be economic fallout.
Keep an eye on what's going on with the UASF leading up to August, and make decisions to protect your coins as you see fit.
As long as you do not transact during a chain split event you are safe. But the markets may also crash in response, so some people are selling in anticipation.

That wallet you don't recognize is yours. It's a change address. It'll happen for most of your transactions. Basically every transaction you do needs to spend 100% of the "inputs", so any amount you don't want to send to the destination needs to be sent back to you, and that usually means it's sent to a completely new address. It's a bit weird but that's how it be.
This once happened to me when I first got into bitcoin, freaked me out, some people even trolled me and told me it was lost. But I soon figured it out. Don't worry.

Ethereum's supply isn't decided.
But right now it's a completely fixed block reward.
Inflation is measured as a percentage of the total supply. So now, do the math and see what happens with a fixed block reward. You'll find that although you are technically correct to say it's inflationary, the inflation rate decreases exponentially over time.
Ethereum's problem is that the devs really do control it and while you can call their technique "agile", it could also be called "making it up as they go along" which means we're all guessing as to whether PoS will ever happen or what the final inflation schedule will be.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:28:13
Always nice to hear from miners. You guys need to show up here more often, IMO. 
SegWit should, yes. And to the extent that UASF helps activated SegWit, yes. But it's not the only way to activate SegWit.
SegWit transactions get a fairly sizable fee discount relative to legacy transactions because they are smaller (sort of - a big chunk of the data no longer counts towards the transaction size). Another way of thinking about it is that SegWit allows you to store just over 2x as many transactions per block. Of course if blocks still fill up even then, there will still be a fee market.
But SegWit does open the door to other ways to achieve scaling as well.
The next steps after SegWit will be Schnorr signatures, which again decrease the size of overhead data in the block chain, allowing more stuff to be put in there without increase block size. And lightning network, which allows large numbers of sub-transactions to be summed up and settled over a single transaction enabled by time-locked contracts.
And I got a funny feeling we're definitely getting a block size increase hard fork. If not now, at some point in the next few years. Just by popular demand (not so popular right now, mind you, but I think that'll change).
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:21:16

Security has nothing to do with hashrate. It has to do with **how expensive** it is to buy a given proportion of the mining network's effort. As long as technical progress continues to be made, hash rate MUST increase to keep the level of security the same. That is the entire purpose of the difficulty mechanism. The hash rate is a surprisingly meaningless metric. What you need to know is how much money does it cost to buy 1% of bitcoin's network? 51%? And is that amount of money within reach of people who want bitcoin to fail?


That is something individual miners may decide to do, but "we" can't force them to. I get the distinct sense that charity is the last thing on many of these miners' minds.

A cheap to spin up node can't help you here.
What you need is existing, economically important services to run BIP148. People spinning up UASF nodes at home are only really accomplishing advocacy. If exchanges and payment processors and miners don't run BIP148 nodes, the boycott/naval blockage will be entirely ineffective.
It's kind of like a proof-of-spending system. In order for your BIP148 node to matter, it needs to generate bitcoin transactions... and not just any transactions, but ones that need to be received by a large proportion of the entirely community. Spamming transactions won't work.

I wish we could just increase block size a ton and be done with it, but we probably can't.
People will use the blockchain to store all sorts of random shit. Actually using bitcoin to transact will be no easier. We'll still have full blocks, full mempool, and the same fee market we have today. Meanwhile, it will become much more difficult to run full nodes, after some time d/l and sync will takes weeks instead of days, and bitcoin will become irreparably centralized.
We need off-chain solutions, and we need SegWit to make these practical, safe, and doable on a short enough time schedule that bitcoin will still be relevant by the time they are available.
Fortunately, litecoin has activated SegWit, so devs should be able to build systems on litecoin and port them over to bitcoin once we're ready.
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:29:38
Is that up or down bandwidth you're measuring there? Nodes use both so you'll have to be more clear.
I'm pretty sure Lombrozo's $100 was not entirely mathematically derived... he invented that number as a hypothetical situation. I also think that a simple assessment of "bigger blocks = lower fees" is naive.
The fee sets the price of using bitcoin and so affects demand. This means that raising supply (block size) just results in higher demand, and a continuation of a fee market. At some point we can expect demand to level off, but who knows where that point is and how big blocks would need to be to get there. What is your node *capable* of handling? Don't forget to also consider CPU and RAM usage. And do you think your experience is the same as node operators in the rest of the world?
So the path to lower fees is perhaps better accomplished in another way. 
I've used this analogy before - raising block size is like expanding a city's road network. The end result is not less traffic congestion, because by expanding the road network you increase the utility of cars and it doesn't take long before people buy more cars and drive more.
What you need is to offer mass transit options. The 3rd party tx malleability fix brought by SegWit greatly assists other developers with a bestiary of time locked contracts that create payment channels between specific endpoints. These endpoints are likely to be mining pools, exchanges, and payment processors. This will shift an absolute shit ton of traffic into the payment channels and consolidate them into a much reduced number of on-chain transactions. And it's just as secure as before - just not as granular.
I think SegWit's only weakness is that it's not going to roll out immediately. That's the soft fork doing its thing. Once activated it'll take a while for people to upgrade, although I expect business and miners will upgrade quite quickly. And it'll take a while for LN to come to a wallet near you.
We've got what looks to be a pretty damned good solution. Will we need even bigger blocks? Maybe. But I think we should try one thing at a time. Careful, methodical change. So while I'm not convinced bigger blocks will "destroy bitcoin", I'm also thinking we need to be careful. Some people say SegWit is too little too late, but it's also possible to get too much too soon.

They've already coded a hard fork, but are still debating over changing it a bit here and there.
The hard part is getting people to run it. 80% of hash power has committed to doing so, which will put a lot of pressure on exchanges and payment processors to follow suit.
FWIW if the hard fork gains legs I expect a major schism in this community. Some core devs will oppose merging it to the bitter end, others may decide to merge it. Likely result, IMO, is two bitcoins. Permanent chain split, with a similar split among core devs as well.

First stage of the agreement is "activate SegWit". That's it.
There was a statement for doing so on bit 4, but it turns out that they're only using bit 4 to lock-in SegWit2x itself, after which it begins to signal for SegWit on bit 1, as well as starting the count down to the hard fork.
They've seemingly done the SegWit activation part quite well, in fact. The problem is the hard fork. Remember the whole "6 months" delay that was supposed to occur? Well it's been re-interpreted to mean "6 months after the *agreement*", which means it's only a 3 month delay now...
How the hell are they going to get nearly unanimous support for a hard fork in only 3 months?

IMO bitcoin and Ethereum, while not quite "apples and oranges", aren't exactly apples and apples, either. Yes, they are directly competing as far as speculators and day traders are concerned, but in terms of actual technological goals? Not really. Any two publicly traded companies can be considered competitors from the point of view of potential investors, regardless of whether their products bear any resemblance whatsoever. BTC and ETH are a bit like that. Bitcoin has *always* been about rebelling against corporate and centralized control. So that puts bitcoin directly at odds with ETH in terms of goals. Just because they both have a blockchain at their core doesn't mean they're the same thing.
I'm torn because while I believe in bitcoin's core principles, I also have found myself with an unexpectedly significant proportion of my savings in BTC. I didn't spend much money on BTC but it's gone up so much since I bought in that it would be a painful pill to swallow if it all dried up.
I'm probably going to have to hedge my bets here and go 50/50 between BTC and ETH.

I see after all these years of people saying like this a broken record, none of it has stuck.
"Bitcoin core" can't sign anything and can't promise anything. The parties to the HK agreement could only speak on behalf of themselves *as individuals* because "bitcoin core" does not have a project manager, lead developer, CEO, president, etc. The core devs who went were warned not to go because it would be used against them as a political stunt. The core devs had no power to make promises in the first place, and people just didn't understand that.
Maybe you don't like that, and wish that some guy from core could go to a meeting and say "I will sign this, and make all of the other devs not present agree to this" but it doesn't work like that. And it musn't.

No, it is a volunteer effort.
If you're a business or bitcoin holder, running a full node can give you additional security since you don't have to rely on individual third parties to get the state of the blockchain/your bitcoins. However, this comes at a price of bandwidth and such.

There's a good chance we're going to get that hard fork anyway. 
Be thankful it's not EC, at least. The last thing we need is giving miners with high hash rate another tool by which to secure their dominance.
There's also another small bit of comfort for you: it takes a hard fork to increase block size, but you can decrease it with a *soft* fork. So if SegWit2x's hard fork makes block size way too much and node operators suffer badly, we have a way to fix that can be made 100% backwards compatible.

Devils advocate time.
The UASF is all about economic consensus. People seem to have forgotten that. Your node doesn't matter in the UASF unless it's, say... mining, or powering an exchange or other major service. The "user" in UASF does not mean what you think it means. The signatories to SegWit2x are users, too, and also power much of bitcoin's economy. Unless something happens to derail SegWit2x (very possible), unless UASF gets an absolute shit ton more support from businessesand miners, then SegWit2x may win... at least at first. The users true power is deciding which chain to invest in, in the event of a split. A split is a certainty with the hard fork, so we then get to watch which chain will trade for the most money on exchanges. Miners will follow the money in the end.
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:11:52
What is this, effect preceding cause? Has time started flowing backwards? The (partial) answer to your question is in the post you are replying to.
The other half of the story is that it incentivizes miners to ensure that it remains possible, which requires that they block an entire class of changes to bitcoin which happen to alter the header structure.
SegWit does so - but only for SegWit blocks. Want to figure out which miners are using covert ASICBoost? Wait until SegWit is activated and see which miners continue to produce mostly legacy blocks.
If they all start using mostly SegWit blocks, then the situation is resolved and we can stop worrying about covert ASICBoost. Miners can continue to use *overt* ASICBoost, but nobody really cares about that because it's less profitable and everybody will know who is using it.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:25:12
Yup, it matters.
ASICs = "Do the job quicker", ASICBoost = "only do half the job but lie about doing it all". Big difference.
Proof of work must be *proof*. From a security standpoint, it's bit of an acedemic argument because rising hashrate and the money sunk into that protects bitcoin from 51% attacks either way. But ASICBoost's problems are in enabling centralization, killing competition via litigation, and discouraging any change to the block header which threaten its use.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:22:04
It's not a death blow, but it gives a tool to its patent owners to gradually build up dominance. Unlike I am worried about the centralization effects this can have.
It's true, in the past it's been apparently worse (Ghash.io, which no longer even shows up as a mining pool, once had more than 50% of the hash rate). But IMO what matters is the underlying cause of the hash rate distribution. Ghash happened to have the most popular service at the time, so people voluntarily pointed their miners at them. When 51% attack concerns came to light, people pointed elsewhere.
I can't help but feel it's *very* different this time.
Since ASICBoost is enabled by an actual exploit of how the block header's composition interacts with the SHA256 algorithm, fixing it shouldn't be seen politically. It's just fixing a vulnerability. It's not a vulnerability that will cause people to lose bitcoins, however. So from that point of view it's not a critical problem.
@_date: 2017-06-17 02:41:36
Bitcoin has been on many downward trends in the past. The post-Gox situation was a somewhat difficult few years, for example. It's been proclaimed dead more times than anyone can count. Seems more alive today than it's ever been, however. Fees are higher, yes... and that's why. The fees would be *going down* if bitcoin was failing.
It's not a terrible idea to be skeptical of bold claims about technology. If LN isn't everything it's cracked up to be, it will be far from the first technology to have been mostly hype. Still, I hope that's not the case. And it's certainly not the only possible innovation that can come from these time locked contracts.
Recently people have been getting hyped up about drivechain, including Luke. He's hyping it up as a way for us to have all we want - big blocks, and small blocks, simultaneously. Yet another thing I'm going to have to read about I guess.
This isn't exactly what bitcoiners want to hear, but segwit also enables another type of solution that doesn't get talked about much. Atomic swaps with litecoin...
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:31:56
Here, try this.
Right now there are 92,451,150 ether.
Block rewards at 5 ether and come every 17 seconds on average. That is 5082 blocks per day, or 25410 new ETH every day, 9274650 per year.
So the current inflation rate is 9274650/92451150 = 10% for the year.
Fast forward a year from now. There will be 101725800 ETH but still 9274650 more ETH each year.
Then the inflation rate will be 9274650/101725800 = 9%
The more the total supply grows, with a fixed rate of issuance, the lower inflation gets.
Ethereum also has the "ice age" to potentially deal with, proposed decrease in issuance (to around 1/4 IIRC), and a chance to PoS which will result in who knows what. So you're right to be concerned. The future is uncertain... all we can do is calculate based on an assumption of status quo.

You know lightning transactions still use the blockchain, right?

I dunno. I think it's a problem. Just because I personally haven't had to pay high fees because I keep my number of inputs low doesn't mean other people's experiences are invalid.

There's a problem with this. Setting block size via consensus would have to be done through a voting mechanism. That precludes allowing non-mining nodes to signal because that would allow for Sybil attacks. So this means an idea like EC needs to be for miners only.
We must not give miners the power to adjust block size limits. The miners with the most hash power will use their disproportionate influence to set block sizes which negatively affect competition, including both other miners as well as non-mining validating nodes.
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:30:31
At the time the whitepaper was written, full nodes and miners were exactly the same thing. People who ran a node were also miners. And you could do this on your home computer for a time.
The situation now is very different and there has been a specialization of roles on the network. Miners have focused entirely on creating new blocks, while the rest of the nodes don't bother and instead focus on the job of creating the p2p network.
Because of that specialization of roles, the non-mining nodes actually do a large chunk of the validation and enforcement task now. While miners get to decide what transactions to package in a block, nodes get to decide what transactions are *allowed* to be packaged into a block, and also which blocks are valid as well. Of course there's a complex interaction with hash power helping to decide which chain becomes the longest chain in the event of a split chain.
ALL fully validating nodes including mining nodes and non-mining nodes enforce the rules of bitcoin and changes to those, but it's the highly visible non-mining full nodes, with which your wallet software makes connections to, that have the greater influence over that process.
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:58:09
It was... in hindsight.
Whether this rise is also crazy depends entirely on whether or not it ends up being a bubble that collapses into a black hole, swallowing the entire market for 3 long years. Two consecutive chain splits (one from BIP148, one from SegWit2x) could do that.

The one where he/she expects core developers to work like a corporate dev team, with a lead that can whip all others into submission, speak on their behalf, and make promises.
A hell of a lot of people don't understand that bitcoin core is just a loose collection of people who work on whatever the hell they want, but under an agreement that none of their work can be merged into the core software unless it passes through a rigorous peer review process.
People expect that a few devs from bitcoin core can make promises. They can't. And they shouldn't. While that may be hard for people to understand if all they've seen is the corporate world, it's the kind of dev team that bitcoin needs to prevent any one dev from having too much influence.

That's a bit much, don't you think?
I am not particularly fond of BIP148 but its supporters are clearly motivated by rebellion, cypherpunkery, and anti-corporate sentiment. Motivations that are basically why bitcoin exists in the first place.
To accuse them of collectively conspiring to "trick miners" is not very convincing. Trickery requires subterfuge and hidden payloads. BIP148 is too simple and brute-force to be trickery. It's a club to beat non-compliant miners upside the head with. No sneakery is needed. And you can see this in the pro-BIP148 rhetoric. It's dominated by war slogans and calls to action of the "with us or against us" type.
Hell, I'd probably be more supportive of it if it *were* more subtle than that.
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:50:07
The nodes that matter, the economic nodes, will probably follow the money. So what happens next is going to depend on where various exchanges, payment processors, and so on stand when it comes to the hard fork.
That said, with a hard fork situation, there will be resistance. If even *some* hash power and economic nodes are against the hard fork, bitcoin will split into two coins and everyone against the hard fork can ally with that side.

The proof of work algorithm requires the miners find a number which, when hashed together with the rest of the block header, produces a new number that is lower than a target. The target is set by the difficulty (higher difficulty = lower target), and if the miner finds a number that works, the block is theirs to claim.
The number the miners are searching for is called a nonce, and they do so by randomly trying different nonces until something works. The nonce that works becomes the proof that they did a certain amount of work to arrive at the solution. Luck is of course a factor, but on average, any two miners who find the same number of nonces over the same period of time did the same amount of work.
ASICBoost breaks this. It means that the nonce is no longer proof that the miner did a certain amount of work. They have forged a certain percentage of this work by exploiting a vulnerability in how the bitcoin headers are constructed.
Some have called this "efficiency".
But that's like saying it's more efficient for me to forge my friends signature and write myself a cheque, because it saves me the time and effort needed in tracking him down and asking him for money.
And since it's patented, the owners can litigate their competition if they dare try the same. Hello miner centralization!

The F2Pool guy's twitter was a hilarious read when litecoin was having it's little bump in the road towards SegWit activation.
Wang Chun was in super-troll mode and I have to admit to reading every one of his tweets since the founding of his twitter account (it's quite new). He described his views as a quantum superposition, waffled and spouted rhetoric both in favor of and against SegWit, and then one day his wave function collapsed and he started signalling SegWit.
He's an interesting fellow to say the least.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:37:01
Yes, we can both agree that SegWit should be activated first, followed by a period of just watching what happens before we talk any more about the block size.
Also it might be worth watching Ethereum. It has an effectively uncapped block size, because it uses a gas limit that miners have control over. If large block sizes are a death blow, we'll see it happen with Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:55:02
No, and I figured they'd do that. Corporations will support *any* change that looks popular. You'll note that very few of them have openly opposed any remotely popular proposal.
Still, I take issue with calling this the "entire community". The distinction is important because a hard fork requires 100% support to avoid a chain split. SegWit2x doesn't have that and is unlikely to get it.
People are about to find out why so many core devs oppose hard forks.
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:16:39
Are they changing the weights of witness and non-witness data? If not, it should be 2-8 MB theoretical maximum (not 4-8), with an expected average block size of 4.6 MB. 2 MB will never occur because it would require no witness data at all, while 8 MB won't occur either because that would require nothing but witness data.

I am interested in Ethereum, but WhalePanda is right about it being a bunch of ICOs for tokens right now. Actually *interesting* use cases are kind of hard to find, at least ones that have been taken beyond theory.
People are going to get scammed/burned with at least some of those ICOs. Maybe more than "some". Once scammers realize all they need is a booth at a convention, a plan that sounds vaguely plausible, and a ICO smart contract, it may become the best platform for scammers around.
Before Ethereum, you could still do this, but you had to fork bitcoin or another crypto and make changes. So there was more work involved in initially getting to a convincing point. The barrier of entry for scammers has definitely been lowered. Of course the barrier of entry for non-scammers has been lowered as well... worthwhile tradeoff? We'll see.

So be glad that they're letting us see their code so that we can plan for its possible repercussions in advance.

Exactly! And the two different byte costs set upper and lower bounds to block size (for SegWit as-is, that's between 1 MB and 4 MB per block), with the actual average block size somewhere between and changing depending on use.


Absolutely. Raising the weight limit is a hard fork and equivalent to raising the block size. Double the weight limit, block size doubles. 
The only complication is that the actual block size that you're going to get in the end is a little bit probabilistic. You know it'll be between 1 and 4 MB (SegWit as it is now) or maybe 2 and 8 MB (if you set the weight limit to 8 MU), but getting a better estimate requires some statistical analyses of the transactions that are occuring on the block chain. Pretty simple stats, though. And hell, a good first guess would just be midway between the min and max limits. As an example, midway between 1 and 4 MB is 2.5 MB. Pretty close to the 2.3 MB that is actually projected.


Same! Well, I do develop stuff, but not bitcoin stuff.
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:32:02
I don't think it's core vs BU anymore. You'll notice that the SegWit2x agreement which has 84% of hash power in support of it is not implementing anything resembling emergent consensus.
Although few miners have come out and said it, you can see in BU's history had its nodes have been regularly crashing. It's not software that's ready for prime time, and miners could lose money if their nodes are running it.
That said, it's unclear that running a brand new implimentation of SegWit2x developed with only one month of testing time is any better.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:32:24
Other people are going on to extrapolate these adversarial conditions being the norm to arrive at blockchain GB/year figures. So your post is being misunderstood. And there's another headline on the front page right now describing SegWit2x blocks as 8GB. There's some deliberate exaggeration going on here.
You could get close to 8 MB, perhaps, but actually getting to 8 MB is impossible, at least with bitcoin the way it is.
But all of this is up in the air, because it sounds a lot like SegWit2x devs are thinking of fiddling with weight ratios, which would definitely change the practical maximum even if the weight limit stays the same. For example, they can actually increase block size even further by setting the cost of non-witness data to 1. In that situation, the block weight limit would revert to a standard block size limit, and 8 MB blocks would be all but certain.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:16:18
Another way to look at it: if 80% of the hash power is producing bigger blocks, and you're an exchange or payment processor or other corporation that can't afford to lose its shirt for an ideological position (and get sued by customers when their money vanishes because you ignored the block their transaction was in), you're going to accept those blocks. And companies that make wallet software will be in a similar situation.

Soft forks aren't *supposed* to require any particular support threshold, and there are a large number of soft fork activation systems. BIP 8, for example, which seems like a big contender for future soft forks, and it technically doesn't require anything at all - it's a "this is happening in 12 months but you can make it happen sooner if you want" type deal.
SegWit's 95% was pulled out of the air as "seems like a good number".
Litecoin chose 75% for their SegWit activation. Other soft forks can even elect to not require miner signalling at all.
At the end of the day, soft forks are backwards compatible. This means that the actual activation is actually determined by whether or not anybody bothers to run it, and consequences are not really a big deal if it doesn't get a majority of support.
Now, hard forks, that's a different story. You want a lot of hash rate support and hopefully even node support for something like that.

They can't control the website, it's not theirs, and they can't be sure that the tweets are being bought by the same people who made them, or who actually received payment for doing so vs organically retweeted.

These are being made for other cryptos (not bitcoin) that have more ASIC-resistant PoW algorithms. Or ones which just haven't caught the attention of ASIC manufacturers yet.
The article stickied on explaining why graphics cards have increased greatly in price in the last little while basically pins it all on Ethereum. I had no idea it wasn't ASIC mined. They claim to be ASIC resistant but so did Litecoin. With the price having risen... we'll see soon enough.

That's like saying that the existing SegWit blocks can be up to 4 MB.
It's actually not possible to achieve that, because it requires transactions not contain any UTXO data.
The SegWit2x blocks will be 4.6 MB, on average, if 100% of the community adopts it and every single transaction is a SegWit transaction. And if the devs don't screw with the weight ratio, which they've suggested they plan to do.

Calling it a "store of value" or "digital gold" is selling it short. That is not the bitcoin I signed up for in 2013.
Bitcoin's vision has always been so much more comprehensive than this.
Bitcoin's purpose for existing is to facilitate trustless, secure *transactions*. To bring about nothing less than a revolution in how people exchange goods and services. Maybe it can't acchieve that as is, and without being reborn in a rather different form, but that's the goal. Let's not lose sight of that.
Whether the transactions are 1-1 "on-chain" transactions or many transactions combined together and only settled on-chain doesn't matter so much. What matters is that people stop thinking that being a holder is what bitcoin is all about. It's so much more than some glorified savings account. And that's why we're having this scaling debate.

Actually that's not describing a hard fork. Just a generic fork. All forks - soft and hard - involve nodes deciding to reject some blocks and build off of others. But the risks are different between them, and this needs to be considered when given the choice between them.
I am not in agreement that hard forks are impossible, however. Just that they should be used with caution. I've seen core devs say as much, as well. The idea that hard forks must never be used under any circumstances is an idea that will become strangely less popular once a hard fork truly becomes necessary. Just right now, not enough people are convinced of the necessity of a block size increase HF.
Another relevant bit of history in the quote is that it treats nodes and miners as one and the same. Which is no longer the case. Andreas is right when he calls the scaling debate a power struggle. Maybe you and I are here talking about technical details, but much of the debate has moved on to what is the role of miners vs full nodes in a world where these specialized roles now exist. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:34:22
Whether blocks are valid or not is decided by nodes - this we agree on. But whether BIP148 supporters can justifiably call themselves the side with the valid blocks depends entirely on whether or not BIP148 gets majority support.
If BIP148 does not attract majority support, it will be the one doing the splitting, not the miners.
There are really only two acceptable situations for BIP148 - either it gets overwhelming support, or it gets none at all. All other options will unleash collateral damage. So I understand why you campaign for it so vociferously.
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:57:01
There's possible harm to anyone who tries to transact during a chain split event.
Although it's nice to think everyone in the bitcoin space is technical enough to know how to ensure transactions are on the desired chain, I really don't think that's the case. Bitcoin is just easy enough to use that anyone can do it, no technical skill required, so expecting people to learn a bunch of stuff to avoid problems during a chain split event is asking a lot.
I wonder what proportion of bitcoiners even follow this debate much. I mean I come here every day, but that's because I'm obsessed, haha.
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:01:21

There's been so much political infighting, and bitcoin devs saying very hard-lined things both for and against SegWit, for and against the importance of validating nodes, for and against bigger blocks... it may be very hard for these mining pools to know what to think.
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:30:24
This was an open letter circultated around by a lot of miners... you think they could find a better English translation. It's hard to tell if the vagaries are intentional or due to a language barrier.
What I take from it: they actually support SegWit2x, so no change. That also means they support SegWit, but with some strings attached of course. This just re-affirms that they continue to support it now that the alpha code has dropped.

"entire community"... 11 mining pools. Well I guess that's not as centralized as it could be, but it's still pretty sucky IMO.

@_date: 2017-06-15 20:09:51
The HK agreement was posted online on [Feb 20, 2016](
Many months prior in **mid 2015**, the code for a 2 MB hard fork had already been written by an at-the-time core dev, Jeff Garzik. Not just a BIP, but an actual implementation (AKA code). The BIP [is available here]( and the link to the implementation is near the bottom.
Care to explain how this meshes with your understanding of the situation?
Did the miners want the devs to copy that code and plagiarize it? Did they want to merge it into core (which they couldn't do)? Did they want a better activation method (which a BIP 9-like thing would provide)?
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:15:01
The mempool is the line up outside the door. But the restaurant is still full.
Much of the competition for transactions happens when you see the fee and decide whether or not to submit the transaction in the first place. This is akin to people seeing the lineup and not bothering to stand in it at all. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:59:18
I don't claim it's a good idea. Just that lots of people do it.
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:20:29
With the caveat that miners and nodes were the same thing at first (and in the whitepaper), miner-signalled activation methods didn't exist, and consensus changes were decided via intentionally forking and waiting to see where the hash power went. We would all just run whatever the hell node software we wanted, and the longest chain would win.
Devs have since figured out more complex activation systems whose purpose is generally to measure support for things before even activating them, so that you can try to avoid bitcoin chain deathmatches.
It's best to think of the whitepaper as describing a bitcoin prototype. It's not entirely what we ended up with.
Ironically, BIP148 is reinstating the bitcoin chain deathmatch system.

The nice thing about the NYA is that running UASF is no longer nearly as reckless. At least so long as the NYA proceeds, that is!

What's weird about that? 1 address is the destination, 1 is the change address.


Mining pools pay numerous separate miners. That's the whole point of them.
I think Bitmain is a major centralization risk, but the transactions you linked to are what I'd expect for a mining pool. Nothing stands out as being odd. If anything it's evidence that Bitmain is getting a considerable amount of third party hash power pointing at them. That makes me wonder why people don't point elsewhere. I've heard that Bitmain basically bribes people (via hardware discounts) to point their miners at Antpool.
[According to this source]( Antpool's minimum payout is 0.001 BTC. All of the hundreds of transactions you point out are above this value, so they are consistent with paying miners their daily earnings.

I understand and I don't mean to disagree with what you mean to say. But I'm sure you can understand how your words will be twisted.
I am highly skeptical of the hard fork, but I'm going to wait for the code. Depending on how they change the weight ratios (I hope they don't), it might be more realistic to call it SegWit4x.
*Current blocks* are too large for me to run a home node. I share an internet connection with others and we use the crap out of our bandwidth, so there really isn't much more to go around.
You're *always* going to marginalize some home nodes by increasing block size, no matter how little you increase it by. There's a trade-off between network throughput and decentralization. I'm with you in that the optimal trade-off errs towards the side of decentralization. On the other hand, I'm not blindly optimistic that LN will be a magic bullet, either. We might need an additional modest block size increase, especially since LN might open up new use cases that could add further demand.
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:22:20

@_date: 2017-06-12 20:13:08
Isn't Eth's use of gas limit plus miner voting supposed to ensure it scales "infinitely" (to the limit of bandwidth)?
Not trying to pump it, but it has miners voting up/down the gas limit, which is the effective block size. I consider that interesting because if that's not scaling, then the Bitcoin Unlimited folks have some explaining to do... their idea is essentially identical.
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:40:53

Because there are multiple routes to centralization:
- Node centralization
- Miner centralization (really a specialized case of node centralization)
- Developer/leadership centralization
Ethereum's leadership is far more centralized than Bitcoin's, owing to the fact that its inventors are still active participants whose word is valued more than other opinions. They have some authority as a result.
Although to be fair, the current state of bitcoin's mining centralization is a big unknown. Some folks believe that Bitmain is just part of a larger group of allies who have a large dominance over the mining network.
So I suppose this point can be argued both ways.

And it'll be a shitstorm too. "Censorship!", they'll say.
And it'll even convince some people.
Probably won't happen though. EULAs/TOS exist mostly to allow corporations to selective take down things which are taxing their servers, or to cover their asses to some extent from legal problems. They don't necessarily have motivation to investigate random nonsense like this.
Just as an example, bitcoin full nodes are actually against the TOS for many ISPs... not supposed to run servers unless you pay extra for the business package, static IPs, etc. But they'll only shut you down if you do something extraordinary like try to run 10 of them from home or something.
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:13:57

Thanks! It's nice to see people asking questions and not just allying themselves to a cause based on twitter posts.
Bitcoin is perhaps the first system I've even encountered that requires a distributed meritocracy/technocracy to operate it smoothly. What I mean by that is that node operators and miners and even normal users should probably know how bitcoin works, because they are actually helping to decide its future. But we're seeing twitter being used as the battleground, and so many people aren't tweeting explanations or questions, they're tweeting politically charged rhetoric.

SegWit fee discounts are guaranteed by code. At least at first, this will be a very clear benefit - using a SegWit transaction instead of a legacy transaction will cost you about half the fees and you'll be able to see this just by fiddling with your wallet without even sending transactions.
Your point, if I read you right, is that the blocks will fill up not long after anyway and the fee market will continue. But even if the fee market continues, that doesn't meant the equilibrium price will be the same. But, you might be right, which is why SegWit is only one of many things we can do. But let's no let the possibility that's it's not enough stop us from doing anything at all, yes?
SegWit also fixes three separate vulnerabilities, so it's just as much a security patch as it is a scaling solution.
For the curious, those are:
- 3rd party malleability
- Covert ASICBoost
- Quadratic sighash scaling, which can be abused to cause DOS attacks
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:53:15
I wish the SegWit2x compromise wasn't so rushed with the hard fork plan. 6 months seems like a lot at first, but as we've seen with SegWit, it takes a long time to arrive at consensus when you're doing "design by committee". Everybody has their pet idea and is reluctant to let it go.
Otherwise it's one of the very few things actually giving me a whole lot of hope right now. Maybe UASF will work out but it seems like a pipe dream right now, and the rhetoric around is has be concerned. That said, if a few more decently large miners get on board it could snowball. But 2 months... not very long.

Mining *nodes* must be connected to the bitcoin network in order to propagate and receive blocks.
The mining hardware (ASICs) will be isolated. The nodes won't be.
When you hear miners complaining about being DDoSed (happened a lot to litecoin miners while SegWit was being signaled for), that's why it's possible to do so. They have to be connected to the network and a lot of completely random peers.
And this is all kind of moot because it's likely that they are just *signalling* without even running the corresponding software.
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:05:32
Yes, of course. But the sweep tx is going to be much cheaper than it would be during peak hours, and then the later transaction will be much smaller due to few inputs, and also much cheaper.
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:43:24
Yup, that's a good way of looking at it. The best outcome of UASF is if it scares the shit out of miners and leads to a resolution before the risk of a chain split becomes a real thing.
However, the follow up hard fork is locked in with SegWit so it's both, or neither. Only way to have your cake and eat it too is to, after SegWit activates, convince the miners, exchanges, and services to switch back to core software. I imagine that would be very hard to do.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:18:21
It's currently in there as an 8M block weight increase. For the beta version it sounds like they plan to muck about with weight ratio and possibly revert back to a block size concept, both of which are sort of stupid ideas, IMO.

Ether is *more* risky than bitcoin.
- It is much more complicated and thus more likely to contain undiscovered exploits.
- Its inflation/deflation schedule is entirely undecided.
- They are trying to move to a PoS system, which is a major change to the very core of Ethereum.
- They are extremely centralized, which puts adopters at the whims of the dev team.
Ethereum classic solves some of these problems, but not all of them.
But some would say that with great risk comes the possibility of great reward. Like buying into Bitcoin in its early days, when its future was much less certain.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:49:13
Yup, SegWit absolutely does. But the other side (tm) likes to say that it probably won't be enough either. Of course they use fewer weasel words and insult your intelligence a few times for good measure, but what if they're right? I suppose we'll know using real world data.

I still vividly remember in 2013, completely in impulse, buying bitcoin. Had to make a day of it. Scanned my driver's license, sent the scans to Vault of Satoshi, got verified... walked to my bank and withdrew cash. Walked to a completely different bank and deposited it into an account with details given to me by VoS.
It all worked but it did indeed feel sketchy as shit at the time.

I visit rbtc regularly but seldom post there... you're right in that there seems to be an increasing number of moderate posters, but I also see a growing loudness of the minority camp of conspiracy theory holdouts. And more puzzling still, a complete 180 when it comes to the prevailing ideology of the sub. Let me explain...
Yesterday there was a thread basically discussing people's plans to switch to other cryptos. Ethereum was a fan favorite. This from a sub whose raison d'etre used to be to loudly complain about perceived centralized authorities ruling over bitcoin development.
I've come to realize that what many of these people on rbtc want is actually a benevolent dictator, instead of the "design by committee" that bitcoin core currently has. This was especially made clear a few weeks back when a twitter post made it to the rbtc front page that ridiculed bitcoin core for being a bunch of scientists that lacked leadership. I couldn't believe it! That's the point of bitcoin core's bureaucracy - to prevent the emergence of an authority figure.
This is why BU has a president. They want firm leadership. They want Satoshi back, and Gavin back. But Satoshi is who knows where and Gavin seems mostly withdrawn from the bitcoin development now.
So Charlie Lee and Vitalik are a second best, I guess.

Enforcing bit 1 signaling with timing deliberately chosen to coincide with BIP148 means that it will indeed be on the same chain. If it works. But in that situation the chain wouldn't split in the first place, so there wouldn't even be a BIP148 chain. So yeah it's a bit inaccurate to say that SegWit2x would be on the BIP148 chain.
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:08:57
Not more users, but a larger proportion of the total industry. By far.
And yeah, I'd say it was more hyped back then. You always get mentions in the news when the price hits new highs, but back then you also had a lot of people talking about things like merchant adoption, dozens of different use cases, and there seemed to be a startup a day with pretty neat sounding plans. A bunch of documentaries came out, it regularly made the front page of reddit not just as a get-rich-quick scheme but as a way to buy (albeit not quite legal) things, and so on.
2013 was hype central for bitcoin.

Any particular reason? Have these mining pools hinted at changing their stance? Had SegWit2x fallen through? The latter is particularly important. Signatories to it will almost certainly not signal SegWit as long as SegWit2x continues to move forward. They don't care what the core devs think about it, either.

My support didn't matter anyway. I do not run an economic node.
And as long as the UASF (via BIP148) is promoted with scare tactics and "with us or against us" BS, I will not be a party to it.
If necessary, I will wait patiently for BIP149. The devs have essentially said it's the next plan. It's also a UASF but with a more sane timeline.
I hate that it could take that long to activate SegWit (assuming SegWit2x fails) but if taking a bit longer is what we need to avoid a chain split, then so be it.
A chain split will irreversibly destroy bitcoin's track record of security if people lose money during the event. I'm not convinced that everyone who uses bitcoin follows this news and will be taking extra precautions at the time. And they shouldn't have to, IMO.

Because segwit provides a soft fork method of increasing the block size. And we would have had it long ago if the economic incentives of miners were aligned with users, as the devs assumed they would be.

You multiply by a coefficient with inverse units.
The hint is in how you'd describe the weighting: each byte of non-witness data is worth 4 weight units, so multiply by 4 units/byte. Multiply witness data by 1 unit/byte.
Goodbyte bytes.

Yes. UASF requires economic consensus, so it's not as easy as a bunch of users running nodes and magically dictating terms to the rest of the network.
When folks like Slush and Electrum say they will support it, that's what to pay attention to. It's those kinds of developments that can make or break BIP148. Miners and exchanges are particular important nodes to have on your side here.
And for that reason it's a bit ironic to consider it an anti-corporate, anti-miner movement, haha.

Sure, but with inbuilt plausible deniability. I can imagine Jihan saying something like "I don't like SegWit - I signaled it just to shut you up but I won't mine segwit blocks unless I have to"

That's great, I agree, it will prevent a chain split by all but ensuring that all nodes on the network signal SegWit.
~~But we still have two different version bits at play here, which is all I'm trying to say. Although practically 100% of blocks will be SegWit blocks, there will be two different varieties, and core nodes will continue to measure signalling via bit 1 only. The network will be dominated by the SegWit2x nodes, so only ~16% of blocks will have bit 1 set and the existing deployment will fail to activate.~~
Edit: strikeout for the misunderstanding I had. Dude I'm replying to is right.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:04:30
You can say the word if you want.
Now let me explain why it can't really take over from bitcoin *where it actually matters*.
Bitcoin is immutable and decentralized. Bitcoin lacks a central governing authority. If bitcoin had a central governing authority, we wouldn't be stuck with the status quo due to failure to achieve consensus. So it's tempting to want a Satoshi type person back. This desire is, I believe, at the core of forks such as XT, Classic, and BU. But the lack of leadership has become a large part of bitcoin's ideology, though it can also be a source of frustration at times.
Ethereum is what bitcoin isn't. It is mutable, centralized, and highly corporate. They will fork to reverse anything bad (enough) that happens, as we've already seen. Vitalik is Ethereum's Satoshi. If he says something, people listen. If he says Ethereum needs to do something, people do it. This isn't necessarily bad for software that aims to be a corporate solution. But it's incompatible with Bitcoin's ideology.
The people switching from bitcoin to ether are people chasing money. Traders and speculators. There are a lot of these people, and if they see opportunity in Ethereum, yes, bitcoin's price could really nosedive. I am one of these traders/speculators and while I've held bitcoin for 4 years now, I can feel the temptation. Do not make the mistake of thinking that trading and speculation is what will determine the *success* of bitcoin. Its actual use cases are steeped in rebellion and care little for its price.
Among bitcoin's reasons for exisiting, immutability and decentralized governance rank very highly. If you actually believe in the core principles of bitcoin, you should see that Ethereum is actually a totally different thing. It is a distributed computing environment that is promoted for corporate solutions, not cypherpunks.
Bitcoin and Ethereum are two different things, and it is actually possible for both of them to win.

0.4% (actually 0.5%) is what another guy calculated based on the electrical fees, guesstimates of electrical cost in China, and power usage of mining hardware. Pretty neat when entirely different guesstimates converge. Might just be coincidence but it's probably a decent guess.
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:03:46
Recently people have been speaking as if the chain split is inevitable.
Is that the case? It's impossible to avoid even with a majority of support?
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:09:14
If Jihan's operation had gone offline we'd know about it by now.
But this situation certainly makes it seem possible. The article makes it sound like these mining operations are sort of hiding out in power stations to somehow avoid scrutiny and maybe get free/cheaper electricity. That sounds rips for a crackdown to me.
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:39:44
Agreed, I didn't mean to shit on Bitcoin's PoW (I edited my post to hopefully make that clear). It's brilliant and it does seem to work for the intended purpose - to keep p2p transactions honest.
Even with BIP148, users still rely on the miners to shift hashing power to what they hope will be the SegWit chain (if there's a chain split). So BIP148 still requires good old PoW.
I am actually not a huge fan of BIP148 due to the risk of a wipeout of blocks on the legacy chain. Talk about a nightmare, if that happened. Chain split is not nearly as big a problem in comparison to that.
But you can't deny that it's probably a more inclusive way of activating SegWit... and a reckless one as well.
I see it as "bitcoin chain deathmatch". Ironically, that's exactly how Satoshi's explanation for deciding on protocol changes would work out as well (the white paper basically just says run whatever node software you want, and may the longest chain win).

For the most part, it's brand loyalty.
However, a lot of cryptos do these ICOs (initial coin offerings) where they pre-mine very large proportions of all coins then sell them for crowdfunding. People buy at what they hope are cheap prices. Kind of like buying penny stocks in a startup.
But the people promising to make some new amazing cryptocurrency with all this crowdfunding might just bugger off shortly after the ICO. That possibility is what people mean by "scam coin".

Spending is my favorite way of selling, actually. A number in your bank account is one thing, but having a new toy to play with is so much more satisfying.

The mempool being very full in May corresponded almost perfectly to a rapid and constant rise in bitcoin price. Once bitcoin price stopped rising, mempool began to clear.
Unless there's clear evidence that it was spamming, seems to me that it was just market activity.
[Here's a long-term snapshot of the mempool](
If it were spamming I wouldn't expect a smooth ramp up and down.
Edit: looks like [there's some evidence]( that it might actually have been spam

I hate to break this to you, bit bitcoin has gone corporate. People's home nodes don't matter. Corporations don't care about bitcoin's founding principles. They care about money.
Despite your apparently intent to make me into some sort of enemy, I think we're on the same side. But I'm a realist and recognize how fragile the situation is. Stop thinking you have some gift of foresight.
You're right that it's a coup attempt, and it's extremely close to success.

Really good podcast episode. I don't regularly listen but this one was definitely worth the hour.
I particularly benefited from Andreas' definition of soft and hard forks and his explanation helped me to understand why both can lead to chain splits.

What if it's a Paypal that doesn't have any authority, can't cancel transactions, can't close your account, doesn't have some legalese "cover your ass" EULA, and can't intervene on behalf of governments?
That's the shit we used to dream of long before the scaling debate reached this point.
The dream, of course, included other things too - digital gold, microtransactions, remittance, pizza... and coffee, haha.
I guess not all of that is realistic, but payment channels/time locked contracts can help make some of it a reality.
If Roger Ver really wants his bitcoin coffee with low transaction fees, he should be helping to activate SegWit.

Yeah, you're right. I think its success is far from certain. But a defeatist attitude in regards to UASF would be self-fulfilling, which I why I think there's a lot of "success is assured" rhetoric going around. Easier to convince people to go to war if they believe victory is certain.

If you use the buttons above the chart to look at different periods, the immediate cause becomes pretty clear. The mempool was generally very full in May. It's hasn't been like that since. More full mempool = more competition over fees.
This corresponds to a period where bitcoin's price was rapidly rising.
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:07:28
It's true, you're up against a lot of momentum. And I can understand frustration in the slow pace of bitcoin relative to this plethora of altcoins, a few of which are growing very rapidly
But, like it or not, adoption is a baggage that weighs bitcoin down and does a lot to prevent change. But it's not just that. It's also that bitcoin development doesn't have leadership. I see that as a good thing.
Ethereum can practically dictate changes, roll out hard forks, and hardly anyone seems to take issue with that. Because centralized leadership over development is part of its culture. Imagine if Satoshi were still around and proposing changes. If he got behind BU, we'd have BU. If he got behind SegWit, we'd have SegWit. The fact that bitcoin *lacks* this kind of authority figure is what has come to differentiate it from the others. The consequence is "design by committee", which is a slow, tedious, and argument-fueled process. But it's making bitcoin secure.
Like it or not, the core client has a long history in this space. And you have to earn your reputation. It is not just granted to you. If you build a fork of bitcoin, it's an uphill battle to be taken seriously.
That's how it needs to be.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:51:16
Yes, absolutely. Technology is a moving target. What is too much for validating nodes right now, may be child's play in a few years.
A 8M weight limit is likely to result in ~ 4.6 MB blocks, on average. Disk space is not really a concern, there are pruning nodes, etc... but if you're running a fully validating node, you also have to act as a server and seed transactions and recent blocks to your peers. Upload is actually a larger requirement than download. It's around 200 GB/month with 1 MB blocks... so would that imply 920 GB/mo with SegWit2x, assuming blocks filled up right away. There's additional CPU and RAM usage that comes with this as well.
That's why I agree with you, the first doubling that SegWit provides will, for a start, actually take time to occur. But it will also give people a chance to measure its effect on nodes.
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:06:06
The miners found a way to push through SegWit2x without core's help. This means they don't need to trust *core*, specifically. All they need is to get at least some devs (core or otherwise) to help them, and enough consensus to safely run the code.
Which means that they could do exactly the same with a block size increase hard fork on its own, after SegWit activated, if they could find enough hash power support.
I don't entirely dislike SegWit2x, but I prefer more controlled "experiments"... especially in production environments. One change at a time is best.
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:36:08
He asked if the hard fork was in there currently, I explained not only that it was but that it's a 8M block weight.
Guess you've got a stick up your arse today, huh?
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:30:21
Yes, it exists, but it's not quite what you asked Luke. I believe there's an important different between the block size and the base block size. Base block size is a SegWit thing.
Here is the code: 
    /** The maximum allowed size for a block excluding witness data, in bytes (network rule) */
    static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE = 1000000;
The code that checks block size (validation.cpp):
    // Size limits
    if (block.vtx.empty() || block.vtx.size() &gt; MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE || ::GetSerializeSize(block, SER_NETWORK, PROTOCOL_VERSION | SERIALIZE_TRANSACTION_NO_WITNESS) &gt; MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE)
		return state.DoS(100, false, REJECT_INVALID, "bad-blk-length", false, "size limits failed");
		
In English, that code rejects blocks if:
- The block is empty (note, miners who mine empty blocks include one transaction, the coinbase transaction, that gives them the block reward)
- The size of the transaction vector (a type of dynamically allocated array containing all of the block's transactions) is greater than MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE
- The block data minus witness data is greater than MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE
		
There is also a constant for block weight:
    /** The maximum allowed weight for a block, see BIP 141 (network rule) */
    static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT = 4000000;
And code that checks that:
    if (GetBlockWeight(block) &gt; MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT) {
        return state.DoS(100, false, REJECT_INVALID, "bad-blk-weight", false, strprintf("%s : weight limit failed", __func__));
In English, that code rejects blocks if the block weight is greater than MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT
So from this you can see that SegWit is limit block size in two different ways. The first way, using the base block size metric, is necessary to measure legacy blocks and ensure they aren't greater than the legacy 1 MB limit.
What's new in SegWit is the second part that checks block weight. This part does away with direct testing of block size and enables SegWit to actually increase block size... as long as it's a SegWit block we're talking about.

We can only guess as to Sathoshi's motives, but in retrospect it was actually a good idea for bitcoin itself.
Charlie Lee and Vitalik Buterin bring a great deal of central development authority to their projects. Without Satoshi, bitcoin does not have an individual whose opinions can so strongly steer the direction of development.
While this comes at the cost of bitcoin not having firm leadership, it also makes it that much harder to undermine.
