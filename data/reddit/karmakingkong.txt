I believe in bitcoin too but please never accuse a user of "spreading FUD" like they are some kind of shill. He isn't in on some conspiracy by Roger Ver or whatever the fuck the Bcash owner's name is. Saying that someone is spreading FUD because they dont agree with your point of view is an attack on the person and not an attack on their argument. Using this statement decreases the quality of discussion on this subreddit.
Until bitcoin transaction fees comes back to a reasonable amount I agree with However, I suspect that even when transaction fees lower even then will not believe in bitcoin. So to him I ask, why not?

Just to clarify, Tom makes money if bitcoin prices go really high by selling it to another person, not by reselling it to the shop because the shop would only give him his gold valuation, i.e $3k (assuming gold prices havent changed, if they have then the shop will account for the increase or decrease and give him that valuation). If bitcoin prices increase and .1 bitcoin is worth $5k, the shop would make new contracts such as "buy .1 bitcoin from us for $8,300 and we will guarantee a $8,000 value in gold"

They do exist btw, for example I can buy a bitcoin option that if it is below $15k on 1st Jan 2019, I get double my money. But I can only buy it using fiat + I dont have many options (there are only like 2-3 options listed)

was simply saying that crypto markets, like ALL asset classes (stock market, gold, etc.) can go down with negative news stories and up with positive news stories.
You seem to think that this is some kind of conspiracy and that news articles do not affect crypto price at all. So let me give a few examples-
1) Jamie Dimon calls bitcoin a fraud- Im not completely sure but I think bitcoin price wen down a bit after he said that
2) ETF Denied- We say bitcoin go down a lot
3) ETF finally approved- Bitcoin goes up like there's no tomorrow
And here's the kicker-
4) FALSE news story that says that crypto prices went down actually lead to people panic selling
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:27:40

Bitcoin Price Prediction- we might see a dip to 5k and a bear market resulting to 1k price. After 2 years we should see above 60k+. Another scenario is that we dip to 7-11k and see a run up to 35k. (Price chart analysis) (Disclaimer- Buying bitcoin is detrimental to your sleep)

Youre a millionaire who wants to keep some money in Btc to circumvent laws that say you can carry only x amount of USD over the border? Done. Porn? Lets buy using psuedo currency, doesnt appear on credit card statements. Gambling illegal in your country? No problem. Drug deals? Well thats why we started fam.

@_date: 2017-11-02 08:25:01
if price goes down and you DCA then you keep buying at lower points. So once it eventually goes up then your profit is higher than the lump sum. DCA is not optimal if the probability is higher of market going up from time of investment. So any normal good investments arent compatible with DCA but this is bitcoin. Im not sure about the probabilities of bitcoin going up in short term.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:15:18
Why has price gone down when this news just happened. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:37:19
Dont worry, let me shed some light of boner-killing reality on your face. Firstly, I doubt any intelligent investor would have a portfolio where crypto takes up more than 5-10%. The cap right now is $162 Billion. Apples market cap is $900 B. It is highly unlikely that bitcoin will overtake apple's cap in one year. Even if it reaches apple's cap price goes to $40k. And believe me, it is quite hard to cross apple's cap. EDIT- Price right now is $9718 and I am hoping that it crosses $25k in 2018 around Jan-feb after which we go to a bearish slump for about a year (maybe seeing $5k in 2019 if we dont see $5k in 2017/18) and see $35k in 2020.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:47:45
How did you arrive at this 0.11% figure? How do you know it is only 0.11% right now? Then you proceed to ask what the current price 1000x to 2500x is. Well if the adoption rate is 0.11% we can only use 1000x to get 110% (ill let you have the 10% extra) not 2500x (because you cant have 220% adopters). 90-400k in the next year? How did you arrive at this figure? (dont say that it grew x% last month so it will grow x% next month. If this were true then bitcoin would be a lot higher right now). What is your prediction for next month?

Then I will proceed to cut 3 of my favourite shirts with scissors so that I cant wear it anymore. After that, I will sleep on my chair for a week. Your method of valuation is a joke and I hope you were trolling. If not, I can provide many reasons why. Im a bitcoin supporter but even with my most bullish valuations I cannot arrive at your figure. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:02:29
Imagine this scenario- A billionaire tells a labourer that he will give him $1 million to fetch a coffee for him. (Why so much? he is eccentric and believes the particular labourer can fetch/make the best coffee in the world). Since it is worth $1 mill to him I would argue the labourer brought value of $1 mill (atleast to someone) (if you believe that bringing $1 mill worth to a single person isnt the same as bringing $10 worth to 100k people then we can discuss that). OP brought $1.8 mill value (when he sells it) to the person who wants to buy the assets that OP has. It is no different than me buying gold at $10 and selling at $30. (If people didnt sell then the price would rise- im not sure if I can use this as an argument for OP providing value). I read comment on him helping with adoption, value and awareness and I disagree with those viewpoints. He did not help with adoption, value and awareness any more than a person that lost his bitcoins in a website.

Okay then wouldnt it be fait to compare Bitcoin's market cap with Paypal? (But since you cant use paypal stocks as payment then Gold?) I think the market cap of Gold+Silver+Copper is a fair comparison. Also it wouldnt be fair to say that 100% of market cap of gold would flow into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:03:42
My target is 20k by next year end. (Hopefully it goes to 20k by Jan lol). So if you buy in at 10k or 7k, doesn't make a difference.

I see your point. My point is that if we know that 10k 16 year olds exist and those 10k 16 year olds save $10 per month then we can place a market cap of $100k for a product that 16 year olds like. (Since the product isnt limited to 16 year olds its likely to be higher. This calculation is a very conservative value of market cap)

Not really. If I short and bitcoin goes to $1 they give me a lot of bitcoins. But if bitcoin then goes to $0 then its useless.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:21:04
huh I thought it would be worth a lot more. Thanks for the math.
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:00:26
Do you think S and P 500 will net an average of 10% gain per year in the next 10 years?
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:03:53
Lol thats only because S and P 500 went up 2% in a month. It is HIGHLY UNLIKELY that it keep up an average of 2% ROE per month without dropping by 5% as correction. I used 1broker.com P.S- out of curiousity, and be honest, before I told you about the S and P 500 thing, did you think I was a scammer? EDIT- more than 2%
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:51:41
if it drops below the cost of mining a coin then miners wont mine, this should decrease supply and increase price. However you seem to imply armageddon, why is that?
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:45:15
Lets say I get an average of 30% ROE per year. Wont make me a millionaire. I need investors but then I just look like a scammer.

mind if i ask what % you are able to save?
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:18:11
you think redditors are wealthier than average people?
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:53:45
Nope. Since you were comparing it to surveying a bodybuilding club for obesity I assumed you thought people were well off here.

@_date: 2018-04-22 17:29:52
It was 0.15 last year, now its 0.018; what do you think the price will be next year? 
@_date: 2018-04-15 05:36:25

@_date: 2018-04-25 15:47:14

How much do u want to buy? How much fees are you willing to pay? 
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:18:25
i said why not try to make more btc?
i.e create jobs, get more btc so that you get more profit
@_date: 2018-04-22 17:00:33
i was thinking that if bitcoin price rises by next year then i would make more because my mining contracts would make me money
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:18:47
what makes u say this?
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:09:22
why not try to make more btc?
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:36:32
well then why do people trade bitcoin on sites like bitmex hoping to make more btc? what about people that invest in 1broker (site that lets you buy index funds using bitcoin as currency) so that their amount of bitcoins increase?
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:43:28
This is exactly whats wrong with this community. is not a failed investor for not believing in bitcoin. He is just missing out on a great opportunity which he does not see as an opportunity, that's it. People like should not invest in bitcoin if they dont believe in its long term value and we shouldnt ostracize them for it. What we should ostracize them for is the fact that they aren't recognizing the value of bitcoin. Furthermore, they are making a bad decision by not investing atleast minimal amounts in Bitcoin. I hear students asking should I invest $50 in bitcoin and people say no just buy a pack of noodles instead. Thats retarded. If you dont believe in bitcoin then just invest $50 in bitcoin and wait 50 years.
@_date: 2017-05-04 13:15:02
I am using exchanges to trade derivatives so I have to keep it there. When Im not keeping it there, what are some cheap ways to store bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:24:31
Who are you and who are you responding to?
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:11:08
dude its easy, just keep adding a fixed amount per week and youll be golden
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:57:24
just buy like 500 rs worth per week
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:14:41
how is that parabolic? isnt a parabola like a U shape or something?
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:00:50
Ill PM u how much im buying per month
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:28:22
okay cool. Can u tell me why bitcoin grew from 200$ to 1k$ in 2014? did something big like segwit happen or what?
@_date: 2018-04-19 08:47:12
which site gives interest and isnt a scam?
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:54:30
Try selling diamonds m8, won't work. At least bitcoin gives cash.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:58:08
why does erryone say HODL and not HOLD?
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:44:51
Ahh damn. $100k then
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:59:33
they would sell it as an insurance?
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:52:52
how is that even possible? lets say youre making minimum wage at 5$ an hour. You can only invest like 200$ per month in bitcoin. lets say bitcoin doubled since ur last investment. Now you have 200 more dollars. thats not more than $30 a day (what ure making at the job)
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:02:01
I still don’t understand why you posted “whaleclub scammed me”
@_date: 2017-05-20 11:40:12
how much can u buy without I.D?
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:15:00
Any altcoins u think will be good? (besides ETH)
@_date: 2018-04-19 09:59:17
BCC was obvious ponzi
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:34:32
if its deflationary shouldnt it decrease in value? also im saying it cant hit a million because then all of us would be multi millionaires, that cant happen because where would the money come from? There will be 24 million BTCs. If each BTC reaches a million then btc cap will be 24 trillion. You think it can be more than the entire world's GDP?
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:43:08
how do we not know that Segwit isnt happening? xD i know its only 90% sure but still!!!!
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:23:07
buy 500 bucks worth now
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:45:43
Here's what I dont get. Bitcoin can be used as a non reversable method of transfer of payment across countries. How are people not seeing the value? What am I missing here?
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:03:29
who is the one you guys are talking about? link? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:04:48
Would you be comfortable telling me what work you're doing?
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:51:32
when was the announcement for segwit due? how can i make sure that i hear about such bitcoin news? im putting google alerts, anything else i can do?
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:15:33
Yeah. So what would your plans for bitcoin be? 
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:07:16
story? i heard about it but didnt he sell at a loss?
@_date: 2017-05-03 13:28:21
why cant u buy $100 of bitcoin now? buy more when it comes down
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:29:19
it used to cost 0.15 btc now its 0.018 ; if mining is profitable next year wont i make a good return?
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:09:54
Bullshit, so you have 5M USD? 
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:12:00
I had charted a pricing model and predicted a rise way back in december. Today we should stabilise around 1620, tomorrow 1650. We will hit 2100+ before crashing.
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:32:48
21,000,000 btc and if 1 btc = 1,000,000 then btc = $21,000,000,000 i.e 21 billion. The entire world GDP is 100 trillion right now (should increase as years progress). So do you think 1 btc can reach a million?
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:58:44
:O how much did u buy when it was $100?
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:02:48
Right now Bitcoin is not used as an online transaction method due to its volatile nature. You can however store it at an exchange and short it as a 1x leverage which means your USD value will be protected. Once someone makes an app which lets you protect your USD value of bitcoin, it will gain mass adoption. Why? Well because then its like using your credit card but better because of the ease of sending someone money. If I wanted to send you, a stranger, some money it would be really tiresome but really quite easy if its bitcoin. Secondly, it is a non reversible payment. That means that once you sell your goods for bitcoins, the person sending the bitcoins cant take your goods and then decide to reverse the charge. Thirdly, it connects the world currencies. If you buy some bitcoins in UK for GBP, you can sell them in the US for USD. Some people think that its only used to watch porn online, buy drugs, hide wealth from spouse, etc. but thats not all there is to bitcoin.

Everyone was rejoicing when BIP 91 activated saying that "yess a fork will not happen on Aug 1st" why did they think it wont happen? why is it happening? Sorry I tried the internet but got conflicting views and didnt understand.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:54:28
Ah sorry mate I only read his comment on disliking bitcoin not the other ones
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:22:05
You can short USD and buy back to take profits and conver them to crypto...
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:20:51
no youre not short usd. Youre just owning bitcoins. Both USD and BTC value will go up.
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:23:35
if u want i an tell u the average price that btc will hit every day in the future
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:13:45
Okay cool. Im a student and im putting money in bitcoin but im disapointed because i dont think itll reach 1 million. So im getting only like 10 times the money i put in. I know that a lot of ROE but its not really good money. Any advice?
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:27:58
short DXY
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:19:58
my point is USD and BTC can both go up.
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:22:24
so what? even btc crashes every now and then
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:08:45
OKEX lists BCC and BCS i thought only one token was coming up. How have they listed three tokens? (BTC, BCC and BCS) 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:55:43

@_date: 2017-07-22 03:05:42
short the dollar index
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:20:37
No YOURE NOT. Dollar and btc can BOTH GO UP together. Im asking you to short the dollar index and dont cheap out, short as much as you can.
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:59:51
why would USD going up mean negative inflation? It could also go up if people import more goods from US than US imports from other countries.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:58:19
why would segwit happening increase btc price? we already know its going to happen so the speculators have overbought btc, shouldnt it come down after it happens?
@_date: 2017-06-12 07:24:23
but it's only 200 btc. There are already millions in bitcoins invested. There are also so many exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:04:46
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:43:16
Aren't we doing the same things to the Fiat holders though?
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:15:23
Why would the government see a huge and increasing hole in their wallet? Its not like BTC will REPLACE USD. IMO BTC isnt a THREAT to USD, its just a convenient method of payment. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:02:12
The federal reserve wont be able to print money if people use bitcoins? People are using bitcoins right now...
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:30:13
Thats like saying 3D movies will replace 2D movies, Credit Cards will replace Cash, cars will replace bicycles, etc. Gold is valuable and scarce and you dont see it replacing the USD. And yes you are right that government can prohibit it as some governements like China are already doing so but some governments like Australia are helping the progress of BTC. UK and USA allow for Bitcoin ATMs to exist.
@_date: 2017-07-31 05:48:25
okay so why did we activate BIP 148? We already got what we wanted (BIP 91)

I have been short btc since $2400 levels. Was still short when I saw price reach $3k. Now im starting to see profits, albeit its not much but ill take what i can get.

i have to choose a fork?
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:38:07
What do you mean its backed by huge governments? Sure, USD is backed by USA but if people stopped accepting USD there is nothing USA can do about it. USA can only choose to artificially increase (i.e unsustainably increase above the fair market price) the price of USD if it so wished. Thats it. They cant force a person or a salesman to use USD.
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:52:47
Poor people in third world countries have internet access and phones but not banking access (because banks have minimum holding requirements which the poor people cannot meet). I am not talking about the cant eat food poor.
