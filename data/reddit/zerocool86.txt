Haha, awesome, well done.

Awesome job, first time around we did not have a lot of people over 80%
@_date: 2016-08-23 21:08:24

Conversions come from direct BTC trading so I guess that for the smaller pairs, the prices go through LocalBitcoins as that's the only exchange that trades NZD for example. So prices will be off.
We don't use FOREX at all, as... the true value of a currency is how much BTC it's worth:D

This has nothing to do with the holidays. Just a big sell from China. According to the stated trades of the exchanges trading BTC/CNY, 92% of the volume is there so they more or less control the market. 
BTC-USD price is just -8.63% compared to BTC-CNY -12.18%.
There is clearly selling pressure in China and the BTC-USD just has to adjust to that.

Yep, we even have a bot that messages us. It was a bit scary.

Nonsense, i think we are still undervalued.

What really bugs me is that Coinbase is struggling on Ƀ 16,706.93
$ 18,313,619.27 volume yet other exchanges handle a lot more than that without major hickups. Hell... we, cryptocompare handle over 1000 trades per second from over 50 exchanges and until recently I was a one man team.

0 fees != fake volume. Yes, it might drive volume up... but it can't be called fake. We have no reason to suspect that the volume is fake. Also, we are working on integrating with more JPY exchnages, volume over there  is over double BTC-USD volume. 
I don't think the issue here is that China and Japan fake volumes I just think there is less interest in Western Europe and North America.
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:03:47
Could be both worrisome and good at the same time. It's been mostly driving the price up. But maybe it's not the high volume in China that is to blame but the low volume in western europe and the states.
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:43:31
I guess if you downvote potential problems they disappear.... ooohhh wait, they don't and just become bigger and bigger.

You do know there is a 'dark market' in China as well... When it comes to speculation.... say you lived in a country that might have currency issues and you happen to be middle class with some savings. Would you not try to protect some of your savings by buying an asset that so far has done well when everything else failed? 
I think western capitalists are playing catchup when it comes to speculation on BTC and mostly trying to do arbitrage to keep up with CNY prices - 8,622.80 CNY - the current BTC price in China is $1,245 according to google. China is trading at a $117.24 premium on the current USD price $1,127.76
That's not really an issue when it happens in India on low volume but when 98% of the trades are at a 10% premium something must be happening.

In the last 1 Day the price has moved by  ¥ -2,000.00 (-25.36%) with a total volume of over Ƀ 9,668.93 K / ¥ 80.56 B . The highest price, ¥ 8,892.29 , was on Thursday, 05 January 2017 at 05:45 (7 hours ago) . The lowest price, ¥ 6,101.12 , was on Thursday, 05 January 2017 at 13:15 (10 min ago) . That's a huge drop...

My problem here is that even if some of it is fake... fine I'll accept that with no proof because the numbers seem too big... even if 50% is fake that's still more than 10x the USD volume. And JPY volume is double the USD one as well  (we'll integrate with the JPY exchanges on cryptocompare in the coming week as well)
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:28:32
slowly recovering? Just 17% down now.
@_date: 2019-06-05 12:23:50
There is also a Q&amp;A + a meet and greet / book signing session.
@_date: 2015-08-19 09:35:57
Yes I think it will recover. But it still has a few periods of volatility ahead, it needs more adoption before it becomes as stable as a fiat currency.

It's just a username so not that much info to start with. I agree it's not for everyone but for small amounts I don't see it as being an issue. You should always take care of your cryptos, keep them in your wallet and have some security in place. 
@_date: 2016-09-13 14:10:44
Feel free to use it for that:)
@_date: 2016-09-03 22:09:00
We've also had over 70k volume. This is looking good, it looks like it will continue growing for a while: 
@_date: 2016-09-13 11:52:36
We'll have a look at doing longer videos in the future:) Thanks for the feedback. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 16:56:05
There is a big price difference between the BTC exchanges  We are at almost 4 Million BTC volume for the CNY market, any clue what is driving this price spike?  
@_date: 2015-10-18 16:14:48
I think it was mostly due to the increase in volume on the CNY market, like ctfnoob says, there was a sudden increase in demand.  half a million BTC in 24 hours just on the CNY marketis amazing volume.

you can follow the trades here:  but there does not seem to be a lot of activity so far.

You can follow live streaming prices here  There is also a trades tab if you want to follow the actual trades.
@_date: 2015-10-08 14:34:52
Really slow so far.... it will pick up in the next few days i think. I'd say it will be just over 1000 BTC in the first 24h.
@_date: 2015-10-17 23:30:34
Well done! I wrote part of the questions so.... my scores are not as legit:) 
@_date: 2015-10-08 13:59:00
What do you think their first 24 hours volume will look like? They have done just over half a bitcoin in the first half hour
