You don't sign a message with an address, you sign it with a corresponding pubkey. You already understand this but I'm putting it out there for others.
Assuming we had quantum computers capable of cracking ECDSA it would be pointless for Satoshi to move his coins before signing a message. This is because we've already known Satoshi's pubkeys since the time were mined. Satoshi's balance (at least what we assume is his balance) is are already not quantum safe. This is exactly what is explaining. 
tldr: Most early coinbase(mining reward) transactions are not quantum safe due to the fact they are pay to pubkey instead of pay to address transactions.

I see the same here, can confirm that the tag is still on openstreetmap....

The trezor uses BIP39 for menomic &amp; BIP44 for deterministic addresses. I don't think that electrum uses these methods.
Looks like the following page (I have no affiliation with it) can be downloaded and used on the offline computer to test. Or any other wallet that that supports bip39&amp;44

You might like to understand that the "mnemonic recovery" is kind of a misnomer. What those words are is the a seed to generate an effectually unlimited number of private keys+addresses. Mycelium uses some standards (BIP39+BIP44) which means there are several other wallets (Trezor is the first that come to mind) that could be setup to simultaneously access the same BTC, while you and your devices are the only ones that control that BTC. *edit spelling

This basically means that romit wallet pools all the bitcoin they control and keeps track of each users balance separate of Bitcoin (Big B). If you move all of your BTC to Mycelium this won't/can't happen. Any transaction you generate can only come from your BTC. Mycelium Developers (the entity that maintains Mycelium the app) does not have the ability to create a transaction on your behalf like romit does. Mycelium could never create a transaction that has more input than you control/own.
