I think its at most four other nodes.  That doesn't take away from your point at all though.

You even could call it the genesis.

They are all trying to provide incentive structures to secure themselves, as bitcoin does, they just haven't been as successful to this point.

I can agree with most of what you've said, but by the definition you've given, doesn't gold bullion no longer represent a valid currency?  If that's true, and it was once a currency, then the definition of currency must have evolved to be something that no longer allows bullion to fill that role.  
I'm not really arguing that bitcoin meets all the current definitions that economists are laying down.  Instead I'm arguing that their entire argument is really a moot point.  
I do like bitcoin, and I believe it has great power to be transformative, but I also believe something else could replace it, now or in the future, which I think has been true with most (all?) currency in the past and present.
Thanks for the civil convo btw, i appreciate that.  And I'm really only arguing my view, all above opinions should be taken this with a sack full of salt.

/facepalm (I can be a prick too)
yes it has, it has gone from being a physical thing (e.g. bullion), to representing a physical thing (e.g. gold backed paper), to a societal agreement based on the power and stability of the backing government.  
What IS currency changes the definition of what people are willing to accept as payment.  It changes the definition because it changes the availability, distribution, supply, and ability to manipulate.
In any case, I think you would be hard pressed to find a single definition of the word "currency", as you would be equally challenged to find a single definition of any word.

IMHO the definition of currency has evolved many times in the last several hundred years, and it will likely continue to do so.  To say that something isn't a currency because it doesn't meet the current definition is kind of meaningless, in so much as it doesn't really say whether it can or cannot function as a currency.

I think the tragedy is only that many societies don't weigh the contributions nearly equally, even though we know they are both necessary.

wish I lived in that universe.

I'll only be impressed when they can make it fly to me on demand.

I agree with this wholeheartedly. The world would be a simpler place.  Unfortunately mass delusion is a thing and perception can alter reality.

Ah very interesting, thanks for the info.

I thought only adjacent channels overlapped in 802.11b, is that not correct?

At the risk of sounding edgy ... it took bitcoin to get you to that point?
