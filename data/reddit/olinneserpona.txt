My friend built a minibar in his livingroom. The last thing he bought was a card terminal so he could charge for the drinks:) 
A minibar, in a private flat, with a sign that says "cash is *not* king"

Good! Couldn't agree with you more. I am not a big contributor here, but this is just like in March/April. Price goes up and people board dat karma train. Only now it is bigger(more people)
This subreddit is a huge resource for the Bitcoin community, it is helpful for newcomers, please don't allow it to become another spot for karma collecting. No offence towards r/funny, but this is *not* r/funny.
