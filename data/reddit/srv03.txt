Good. The million dollar question is: Where is the bottom going to be before it rises back up?
If you can call the bottom, you’ll make a lot of $$

I feel bad for the poor souls whose orders filled at $9500. Hopefully he trades get DK’ed

Yay. We can finally short bitcoin!

Lol. They probably had a ton of market buy orders with no liquidity on the sell side. Somehow the brilliant engineers at GDAX thought about it and decided “yea, sounds good... let’s enable trading... This won’t be a fucking bloodbath.”

Not gonna happen any time soon.

I work at a trading group and i know a lot of people who plan to short bitcoin futures as soon as they are released. Most people I work with are planning on dumping their bitcoin right before futures start trading.

You should definitely get in touch with GDAX. Exchanges are supposed to have protections against this type of thing.

Yea it was showing $3k because they hadn’t enabled trading yet. Given GDAX track record, I think there’s a really high chance they refund you.
However, traded volume is 3000 BCH... could be a very costly mistake on their part. GDAX should be able to DK the trades or fork over the ~$5mm to its users.

You put in a limit order at $3000, or a market order?

They just lost millions of dollars the first time they tried to open it
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:51
They’re probably trying to decide what to do so they don’t get sued. And real exchange would probably bust every trade that just happened. It’s only at $9500 due to complete lack of liquidity. Will rip back down as soon as trading reopens.

The floor is at 0

The value behind the US dollar is that US law requires everyone to pay taxes in dollars every year. This guarantees demand for the dollar.
The same obviously does not exist for bitcoin.
