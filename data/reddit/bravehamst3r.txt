At this point I don't want them to implement segwit. I want them to get rekt by a competitor and go under.

I think they're just fleecing noobs and subsidizing the traders who spend a lot on transaction fees.
Anyone know how long Coinbase fees have been that high? Did this coincide with the bcash launch?....

You can get ViaBTC to manually add it to the next block they mine. If your fee is above a threshold it will be free, otherwise you send them 0.01 BTC or 0.01 BCH (send them BCH, its much cheaper, even if it's a scummy shitcoin).

So many contrarians in this sub. Popular/mainstream personalities find an untapped use-case for bitcoin, and begin talking it up, and half of you can't stand it? I don't care what Dave Rubin's politics are, this is good.

How did you fit this data? By hand? Your uncertainty will be massive without assuming 100% adoption.
