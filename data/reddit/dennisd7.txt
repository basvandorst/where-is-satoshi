Oh sure. When I heard it I got a bit of a chill, but I already have my coins in cold storage. But if I didn't I'd probably move them too, away from exchanges and such, until the "bug" was fixed.

In the UK, before decimalisation (in 1971), the symbol for shilling was "s" and for penny was "d". After decimalisation the penny is written "p" (and pronounced "pee" or "pence"). The point is that we don't need to worry too much, these things will fall into place and we won't need any crazy new symbols.

Just for the record, I disagree with this sentiment. The way power structures work is that if you're in a privileged position, it looks like all is well. So your statement works as a silencing method, and the structure stays in place.
I'm not saying this tech is not open to everybody, but as people in a privileged position we are very accustomed to feel mostly welcomed - I don't see a problem with women organizing, creating positive spheres and all that. It certainly doesn't hurt the bitcoin community.

I had similar fears until I did a test run with Armory (one paper wallet with a small amount). Now I use a fresh ubuntu install for the offline system, that has NEVER been online, and I handwrite my paper wallets on neat stationary so they look like love letters.

@_date: 2014-03-05 16:00:21
I don't think they are. But even if they are, then that means they'd have to buy up a lot of the ASICs like the rest of us as CPU/GPU mining is essentially over. So they'd have to fit that into some kind of budget, and a lot of that is slow moving. And in the end they'd make a better deal of just buying bitcoin, again like the rest of us.

Sounds good, that's basically how I did it. Pro-tip: do a few test runs first with a low amount. Also, make about 10 separate paper wallets so you don't have to handle $10,000 all at once.

This has confused me too, but I think I've got it: there is an almost infinite number of possible addresses that will all work, so when it's generated it's already guaranteed to work. This means that if you send a transaction to the wrong address it is practically lost forever - something like sending an email to a random unused email address (maybe...) something like that.

Good stuff! I remember the feeling :)

The second spike was on Feb. 7, when MtGox announced that they'd halt withdrawals. This might have caused long term holders to sell off, or to take their bitcoin into cold storage or something, which would cause a spike like this.
Also the MtGox people themselves might have sold off right before the announcement.
