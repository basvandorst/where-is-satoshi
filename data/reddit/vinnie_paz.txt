Yeah I can buy things online using my debit card, I was almost ready to buy some USB ASIC miners, but using some profitability calculators, even ROI was impossible, getting big things like Spondoolies big ASIC miners, I can't afford it as student.
Thank you.

No I need to get Visa travel, and to tell to emmbasy for what reason you going there "To buy bitcoins" they will denie my visa. Travelling is restricted

Just saying and thinking of that, I really appreciate it and it's like receiving those coins from you, but I won't post any bitcoin address and yeah I have Mycelium already installed.
Problem is fiat to bitcoin access is really difficult here, and as soon as I get an oppurtunity I will make something and make more easier to bring to my country easy access with low fees Euro --&gt; Bitcoin. And I want to solve this long term, not asking to tip me, thanks tho.


I don't live in Africa, but with this current situation it's like being in Africa, I mean geographicaly we are in Europe, but we don't have access to SEPA transfer, we are not in Europian Union, we are not allowed to travel in Europe, we don't have Visa liberalisation, we are like a black hole in the middle of *fckg Europe.

I might look for this option which is not best one, however I have WU office near my home, imagine to stay and tell to people for bitcoin and options for cheap transfer, the WU dude would kill me :)
@_date: 2015-05-04 08:55:21
Ah yeah, that would be the last option, even after I'll try "wire transfer". I am not like "I just want bitcoins, I don't care If I pay +20% over market", if I would be in that situation, maybe I would consider WU, I am trying to buy small amounts regularly.
@_date: 2015-05-04 10:47:31
Thanks, I check sometimes coinmap for if any new bussines is accepting, I saw this but it is in Macedonia.

Currency is EURO, but how to send it, no Paypal and other payment processor.
@_date: 2015-05-08 09:32:04
Thank you, not an option for me.
@_date: 2015-05-04 14:50:29
Believe me or not, I have peeps asking me everyday on Viber like "Anything new, do you have btc?" Trying to buy but wtf can't do shit right now, I mean using WU is like not suitable for me. And yes then I tell them who are interested on buying and everything goes well.
@_date: 2015-05-08 09:27:24
We have human beings here, but all with full of pockets with fiat :) and no no exchange of course.
@_date: 2015-05-08 09:07:38
1) Actually I don't know what to sell or let's pretend I can sell something, what if no one is interested in that service to buy, what all my friends and everyone else need to provide something to get bitcoins ?
2) I would quote this from from that another topic


3) Both Mycelium and LocalBitcoins no any other bitcoiner alive, I have buy ads on both of them, I check for sell ads no within my range, on Mycelium Local Trader nearest bitcoiner is in Greece, I am not going to Greece to buy bitcoins +15% above market.

First of all thanks to your community and specialy which re-created another topic for my problem, and this is not only my problem but it can answer few question like "Why bitcoin is not yet mainstream?"As we see there's no easy way to get to buy bitcoins for like €20.
Suggestions like go buy ASIC miners, or mail fiat or buy via WU +20% on market rate not a solution for me or any other friend of mine who want to try and play for the first time with bitcoin.
The problem is that, I want to buy small amounts every week, not to invest $3k and wait my ROI that I will never get, thats not to supposed to be how new bitcoiners will come on board, this would be ideally on 2011 not now.
Now I will answer everyone's option that offers me, thank you guys, and I am not trying to be like "no, not this, not suitable for me" for like every option you suggest me but thats reality.
In the end I guess what I am looking for is not avaliable yet, thinking of doing something investing and opening doors to my friends and nation to get easy access and to buy bitcoins instant for like just for €5, BTM or anything else that offers this kind of service.
@_date: 2015-05-04 11:23:34
Yeah sure, we have WU and MG monsters :)
Let me know your profile on LBC ? via PM then I'll see what offer you have ?
@_date: 2015-05-04 08:49:03
I forgot to mention that even Paypal does not even listed Kosovo and tryed to open an account and verify it, then just limited my account, they said "we don't support you country, sorry"
As I was thinking Bitcoin would be a "gate" for us that are restricted in many ways, but the problem appears how do you get hands in bitcoin in the first place ? 
@_date: 2015-05-04 10:45:16
Yeah I tryed Mycelium thats what Im using for few bits that I have :)
And yeah I have buy ad listed there for like a month maybe, it's just dead there ...
@_date: 2015-05-04 14:04:43
Well, I could not sign up, contacted support, and here's their answer, makes me laugh.
question from them: 
and answer: 
@_date: 2015-05-04 10:45:48
Thank you, never heard about your service, I'll sign up and see what really offer for me.
@_date: 2015-05-04 11:18:07
Have one, but they limited before even I did any transaction.
@_date: 2015-05-08 08:47:28
@_date: 2015-05-04 10:49:00
Yeah saw on ebay, premium price but whatever when you have no other better option
@_date: 2015-05-08 09:09:02
Actually I can do wire but thats like too much for me, as fee is high I need to wire like €1k to make sense.
@_date: 2015-05-08 09:26:01
Thats exactly what needs to do someone here, maybe first chance that I'll get to do this I would do it.
@_date: 2015-05-08 09:21:12
Thanks if you woudn't ping me, maybe I would not see this.
@_date: 2015-05-05 08:32:09
We have like plenty of them, but actually they are more those banks that are going in countries like us in the development and transition when they charge us with highest fees.
Raiffeisen Bank I guess it's austrian bank 
Pro Credit Bank 
And like six others maybe not worth to mention, these banks are giving loans and they charge from 12% up to 16% depending on credit you get, consumer credit, bussiness credit which you have higher premium, they killing us.
@_date: 2015-05-08 08:49:18
I am not blaming no one, I am asking for options to buy bitcoins, I can do wire transfer, just I can't afford it to as looking to buy small amounts regularly, and wire transfer fee and minimum for exchanges is not suitable for me.
@_date: 2015-05-04 10:55:15
Mycelium local trader no trader within my range, even in my country.
I have buy ad there for quite some time, nothing.
Compare to me, you are in much better situation, you like this 


Well this isn't an option for me, to buy like USB Asic miners thats just waste of time and money, to buy large ASIC miners I don't have money to spend.
@_date: 2015-05-08 09:33:31


Maybe that would be easier than buying bitcoins :)
Hopefully yeah one day would be much easier for average Joe to buy bitcoins from here where I live.
@_date: 2015-05-04 08:50:09
Paypal no, I explained to As for SWIFT yeah I have access to bank account, before that i thought to ask you here for any more "efficient" and instant way of buying bitcoins in situatuin like this.
@_date: 2015-05-08 09:31:31
You saying to OP, right? Imagine to come form Thailand, I must buy like BTC 10k +5% market rate from him to cover his expenses and some profit for him.
*Didn't really did any math, just kidding :)*
@_date: 2015-05-04 08:40:07
How so, care to explain more ?
