Anyone know a good iPhone app to serve as a wallet?

Don’t spend money you don’t have. Stupid idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:19:36
Seriously, it’s not coinbases fault people are retarded. Idk about you, but I didn’t lose any money in bitchcash.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:52:59
Duh it’s worth a shot. If you had even 1 Coin, would you jump in a poop filled lake to search for 18 thousands dollars? Would you find it? Probably not. Worth it? Most definetly lol.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:57:08
People are buying.

Thank you, badgers to prospecting investors I see. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:52:06
If you buy a potato for $1 and then they start selling for $3, you can sell it for $3. That would make you about $2 richer. If my math is correct.

I just like the smell of a crisp Benjamin. That is all.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:50:23
I love you. Now go check that chart bitch.

Hellman’s. So where are you taking me for dinner?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:00:40
That’s a normal swing for the precious metals market...
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:11:41
I’ll put in a $1. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:33:29
Yes a dip is coming. When? Idk. Will it go back up? Probably.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:01:25
This theory is probably the strongest one on this thread in all honesty.

This is the most accurate fucking thing I’ve seen on this thread. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:51:08
My grandpa taught me this. I thank him for that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:25:01
Now that’s one damn thing I can agree with you. BTC is not intended for just investment purposes. And it isn’t a rocket ship, it is annoying everyone talking about orbital objects or planetary bodies. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:48:51
Should’ve mined in 2009.

This fool would forget a zero and think he’s hit it big lol

Harsh ass response dude. But goddamn fucking right lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:11:39
Are you retarded? Literally the whole point of BTC is to replace FIAT. And if an online distributor such as eBay or amazon begins to accept it, that would be a smack in the face to fiat, and a win for BTC. Literally the whole damn point. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:30:49
Yes. The calculator that came with your phone. ;)

Coinbase. Was easy for me, then transfer to secure wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:48:42
I have so many questions where do I start...
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:55:17
No. Your bank account # and routing information.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:17:58
Yeah I know it’s annoying takes a couple days to get karma just comment and like things all over the place. Some of these people on here act like they came out of a vagina and just knew everything in the world. To get somewhere in life you always have to ask questions. Keep asking don’t let dickwads deter you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:20:52
And you get all that from one comment about speculation of the currencies use? Fascinating really. I originally thought that BTC was bullshit, and that it would never stand in the real world. I was a firm believer in precious metals. Still am really. Because looking at the history of it, Gold has withstood the rise and fall of every single country, nation, and government and has been looked at by humans as the real holder of value. But I’ve done as much research as I can, I don’t know everything obviously, but looking at the history of BTC, the purpose of it, the way it was created, and how it is being implemented in the real world has got me from the other side of the fence, to on it. And I feel I might just fall to the other side soon. So why don’t you take your negative comments and worry about your own shit. Because speculation which is what most everyone else is doing is normal. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:14:44
Here comes the government and Wall Street pin heads trying to say what’s right for the people. I say shut the fuck up, yeah it’s risky but it’s not your goddamn job to tell us where to put our money. Remember people, only put in what you can AFFORD to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:30:02
I’m dying lol. But at least he gots his coin my dude 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:18:24
Quantum processing computers are on the horizon. I’m not sure if the algorithm can be adjusted. But it would need to be for computers that could mine x times better than the technology that we have now.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:55:27
That isn’t your bank account
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:27:40
You literally hit the nail on the head as to what bitcoin was created for. People are seeing it as an investment now. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:57:21
I can’t hear you it’s to dark.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:05:33
Hodl* learn to spell. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:57:45
Some of the people on these are dicks. Most don’t help at all. It’s call r/bitcoin what the fuck do they expect, people to NOT come here and ask questions? Bunch of idiots if you ask me. Sorry I’m not sure of the answer either. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:36:23
Wrong. The numbers still have to climb, you just don’t see each incremental step.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:07:02
It’s not stable enough. 
I could see eBay accepting it as most of its sellers are actually small ran business or private individuals. It would be brilliant to see that they could individually opt into accepting bitcoin making it the sellers choice. Amazon deals with some big companies, who might not be to fond of the risk. And as much as I hate to say it, I think BTC is still high risk.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:28:38
I just saw it dip a dollar. BUY BUY BUY!
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:33:17
Yeah I have money in coinbase, I’m about to pass into profits right now. It’s just annoying because these damn fees. I want to put it into a real wallet but everything takes to much damn time.

That’s the thing with a global market, there is no night, there is no morning. Just time, and growth...
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:47:03
No one is forcing you to buy/sell bitchcash. The market recovered. Whatcha bitching about? People lost money so fucking what, they should’ve know the risk.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:08:31
2 plus 2 equal 4
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:29:05
I have been thinking about this ever since I grasped the concept of mining. Computers will become ever more powerful. Technology never stops. But at least the BTC supply does (21 Mil.). So you are saying a new coin would come out of BTC if quantum was implemented? Something like BCH? (But just with a different algorithm) I’m wondering if the price of BTC would drop during this future time. Maybe not crash but just dip and stabilize since the quantum computers would mine up the remaining supply quicker than the older technology did.

A hot wallet is one that is intended to be used often right? But how come you wouldn’t keep much on them? Are they not as secure?

Be nice lol 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:45:33
It can dip from a penny, to whatever it is worth (not likely) and that is sort of true. 
Noticeable dips like 100-2000 dollars are caused by many things. One is high volumes of selling, or an influx of BTC into the market. Other things like hacking (like today) could cause a dip, but it didn’t really which is very interesting. Just remember buy low sell high. But it doesn’t seem to get low very much. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:39:41
Seriously thank you for saying this. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:55:38
It already fell lol

How can you sell if you need to with your own wallet? 
(I am new to this) and I use IOS, do you have a recommendation for a decent wallet app?
