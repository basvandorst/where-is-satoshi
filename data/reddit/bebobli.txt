Can someone inform me what Apple has done to the Bitcoin community? Sorry, I'm quite new to all this.

So uh, does imgur recommend other pictures on the right? I was looking at something completely unrelated to bitcoin, yet here I am in this subreddit again.

Open it up and leave the C2303 or similar battery out for a few minutes then put it back in. Should forget the BIOS settings.

There seems to be hundreds of QR code scanners. I'm just now looking through the market trying to find Scan Code. I'm guessing you can use these as well, though?

Nothing said reassured me that he quite has the simplified solution that the poster above him is asking for.

Even new myself, I can see there's a lot of unusual guests in this thread. The obvious ignorance, mass downvoting, hysteria and insults are very entertaining. I knew there was no way Buffet's conflicting opinion could go down well, but come on... it's one paragraph, likely not even verbatim. The article goes down a lot of subjects with Buffet.
Look, I thought for myself and that one paragraph doesn't convince me that bitcoin is any less of a mirage than fiet money just because it lacks 'intrinsic' value. Especially if he means that it would need to be backed by physical assets. Is he implying USD is?
It certainly used to be backed by gold and now it's inflating. Not as much as it could be. And isn't that due to the research, services and production of the US economy then? When people are paid in BTC for work and the currency is backed by labour then would that prove him wrong?

You're right. No one is promising growth right now with Bitcoin, but it's obvious there's no easy projection, really it's based on my mutual faith with all of you. Fortunately I have it because bitcoin seems to provide features fiat currency cannot...

Everywhere outside a 80 mile radius of Austin is full of hopeless republican christians...
and that's only the vast majority. The crazies are luckily isolated in rural areas for the most.

'Pulling' them? You mean pulling applications from the App Store?
