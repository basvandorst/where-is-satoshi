Some people can't stand opinions.

You can use the node to send and receive and relay bitcoin on the lightning network. It is not random, but determined by the software implementation's routing algorithm.
You could potentially some earn routing fee with your channel.
You will get your BTC back once you close your channel.
You don't "pay" to open a channel, it's "locked" for the channel. 
This would probably do a better job at explaining:

Yes, and you can connect and open a channel to your desktop node on your mobile eclair.

Also encrypt the wallet on Bitcoin Core, as well as a backup of the wallet.dat. But that just standard practice.

This would depends on 1) how you are connected 2) routing fee 3) available funds for routing 4) channel capacity 5) the software routing implementation.

yes, but this would depends on how you are connected with the rest of the network, as well as the amount of routing fee (base fee + fee rate) your channel(s) charges.

Yes and yes, that's because both actions relays on layer 1.

This is as simple as it could get without getting technical at all:

I am looking for a how to run LND on Tor for windows, also wondering if there is something else other than running the browser....

I finally managed (2 weeks ago) and documented my process.

I don't have wirex, so I wouldn't know sorry... If wirex support BIP39, then the answer would be yes. (BIP39 or commonly known as the 12/24 word wallet recovery phrase)

Bitcoin Core will only allow RPC connections from within the local network. This means by default Trusted Node will only work while connected to the same network as your bitcoin node. If you have access to a static IP address (through your ISP or a VPN) you may whitelist the IP address by adding the following to bitcoin.conf
rpcallowip=your_static_ip_address

not your paper, not your book.
