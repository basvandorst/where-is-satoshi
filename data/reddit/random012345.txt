Good job? They sponsored a bowl that had Beef O'Brady sponsoring them previously in a historically shitty and low attendance/viewed bowl. This sponsorship was long before the season.  They got lucky more than anything that the AAC was a 3-way tie and the ACC needed another bowl. 
It's also not saying much that it was a hugely successful viewership.  What was it compared against? What is the normal viewership of TV programs? It's a day with nothing on TV except that game.  It doesn't take much for it to have been the highest rated when there already wasn't many people watching TV. 
**[Here's a list of naming rights cost]( from 2 years ago.  The St. Petersburg Bowl had one of the cheapest costs at $375,000.
You have to also factor in which bowls were up for a new sponsorship and whether BitPay could win the bid.
They took what they could get and afford.

They can still be taxed. If you won a car in a contest, you pay the taxes on it. You pay taxes on anything when there is an exchange of property. They do that so that people don't skirt the system and exchange property to evade a tax payment.
So yes, you still need to pay taxes on your BTC and trades, only you'll have to pay the IRS in USD for your BTC transactions. They don't care about your ideological views. You will pay, or you'll be fined and/or go to jail... but you'll still have to pay.

*X-amount* of viewers is still *X-amount*.  As someone else asked - how does 3.3 million compare to most other typical bowls and shows? It'd be more interesting to see this. Could half a million USD been better spent on just a commercial during a major bowl with 5 million viewers? Or a TV show with 
[Here is a good comparison](  A Thursday Night Football (NFL) game for a regular season game in the middle of the year got 6.88 million viewers. At the same time, an NBA game with LeBron vs. the Knicks got 4.02 million viewers.
At the same time, Louisville - FSU game got 4.97 million. This is nearly 5 million when it's already up against the NFL and a high profile NBA game.
With literally *nothing* on TV really to watch besides reruns and marathons, the St. Petersburg / BitPay Bowl only pulled in 3.3 million.  *Yes*, it was the highest rated on TV, but it was hardly close to impressive when you compare it to other things.  It's taking the data and statistics out of context.  
BitPay wanted a major sponsorship.  That's all it came down to.  There was an opening for the St. Petersburg Bowl's naming rights for 2 years, and they took it.  Naming rights to sporting events are dick-wavings.
**tl;dr**: CONTEXT MATTERS.

I think people are playing down the power of the IRS.  They're some scary mofos, and they'll get their money in some way.  You can almost always count on the government using the IRS to find a way to put you away if they don't have a strong case otherwise (Al Capone). 
The thing is, I wouldn't be worried about mining BTC and hoarding it. I'd be worried about using BTC to buy legit things, because they *are* tracking the sales. Those retailers and stores more than likely aren't going to protect you from the IRS and risk not only losing their business but going to prison. So what happens? The IRS starts seeing trends that you are buying expensive electronics and high ticket items. They'll put it together, and you'll have a nice visit from the auditors.
Big question: where did you get the money to buy this stuff? No matter your answer, their response will be, "why didn't you pay your taxes on that income?"  Even Bitcoin will be, "why didn't you pay your [property/income/whatever] tax on your BTC?"  
Depending on how much you owe or if it was deliberate, you can be facing not only paying what is owed, but serious fines and/or jailtime.  
**tl;dr:** Don't fuck with the IRS. They will get their money, and you will get caught.

You're thinking about it like BitPay strategically planned it. They didn't. None of the naming right sponsors do. It's a dick waving contest where they go after the biggest event they can afford.

[What the hell are you talking about?](
Just because the whole world can use the internet, computers, and phones doesn't make crypto or the technology underneath any more understandable by 99.9% of the country, let alone the world. The world can easily use most of this technology today because of simple design around the front-end UX to make something intuitive and down to earth for anyone to use.  There's a reason smart phones existed for quite some time before the iPhone and never took off until Apple changed things.
Bitcoin is never going to really go mainstream until it eliminates the need for an everyday user to know basic crypto and security. Even a mainstream solution like Google Wallet never took off because it was *slightly* too complex for an average user that added no benefit over taking out your card to swipe instead.  Apple Pay is attempting to fix this problem by making it even simpler.

Exactly. Whether it's by eventual bruteforce from sheer processing power or discovering a mathematical flaw in the algorithm, it'll happen.  Technology moves so god damn fast that we have no clue what we'll have in 5 years.  It's incredibly dangerous to bet everything on the security of a cryptographic algorithm.
@_date: 2014-10-19 19:53:51
Oh, ok. Yea, definitely. All you need is a deep understanding of technology and IT security to properly secure your bitcoin wallet or a trust in an unregulated web site.  If you want to hold your own wallet, then you need to make sure you have redundancy of your wallet and hope that your wallet/drive/storage doesn't become corrupted or a fire doesn't burn down your house and your entire bitcoin wallet or you don't forget your password (which should be complex).  If you want to keep your wallet in the cloud, you need to hope that your cloud service doesn't get hacked.  If you have a breach of your cloud wallet, then you're fucked because there's nothing like FDIC to protect you.  
But yea! There's nothing to worry about the trust in the security of your bitcoin wallet.
But if you read the article, it's has nothing to do with trust in banks holding onto your money, rather knowing how to invest and save for retirement and how millennials look to their parents for investment and financial advise.  In that case, yea, the volatility of bitcoin and the extreme unknown of where it'll be in 1 year (let alone 20-30) is definitely a safer investment than traditional IRA's and 401ks.

I know what cold storage and disaster recovery is. You are basically trusting to a modern "throw it under your mattress" technique. There is no insurance to protect this. Coinbase may claim they do, but they have no obligation. Sure, heads may roll, but in the end there's no guarantee you'll get your bitcoins back. It isn't regulated, which is good but also bad for this reason. 
Yes, it may get an equivalent of FDIC in the future, but it doesn't have it yet. Therefor it's still insecure and a high risk. Until you can transfer all risk and not rely on unregulated third parties or your own personal security practices and expertise, it is not secure. 
You can throw your perceived security in personal and third party DR around all you want. But until you have the security and risk aversion guaranteed in a government regulated banking system, then it's the Wild West.

* Who cares? You're arguing over semantics. The protocol is *one* component in the entire bitcoin system. ONE.  Just like in the US banking system, everything is secured with virtually unbreakable encryption algorithms, but it won't mean anything if someone can still get in to the system to fuck with encrypted data.  It's *extremely* difficult to do so, but even if they did all of this then you are still insured by the FDIC.
With Bitcoin, the protocol is one *small* component.  You then need to trust these unproven companies to encrypt and secure your bitcoins at rest.  Then you need to trust they're doing the necessary intrusion detections.  Even if they have the security and follow regulations of all the US regulations around banking, **they are not insured**.  They don't handle the risk in any way in the event that the risk comes to fruition.  If it does, it's really just "WOOPS!".  In the US banking, if any of those risks comes to fruition, the risk is transferred to FDIC insurance and you are covered losing little/any of your dollars that were stolen/lost in the banking system.
*  Regardless of how many home built disaster recovery procedures you put on your bitcoin storage, every new storage is now a new door that it can be accessed to.  If you keep them all stored in your house, it's only protecting against the computer crash.  If you store them off-site, they're susceptible to other intrusions and breaches at those data centers.  If you are storing them in your same region on your own physically, then you're not protecting against regional disasters.  You doing your own security and DR procedures and thinking *you* know better than the US/Swiss/etc banking system is in the top stupid things I've read in this subreddit.  
This is *all* based on the fact that your entire life savings is protected by your password.  If you lose that password, you are bankrupt.  If you lost your physical token to your bitcoin wallet, you are bankrupt. There is no recovery.  There is no recovery of lost bitcoins.  There is no recovery of stolen bitcoins.  There is no recovery of bitcoins secured by AES that you forgot the password or lost the key.  Forgot your pin to your bank? Cool. Prove you are who you are, and you have your access back.  Someone stole your identity and thus your financials? Eh... not cool, but you can go through legal procedures to recovery your identity and your financials.
There aren't even any legal procedures you can go through to do anything to recover bitcoins.
Security of a system is not *just* about whether someone can get to it.  Security is completely about whether you lost it and/or it's been compromised.  If you lost your bitcoin and you have no way to recover it, it is not secure. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 13:18:35
Security of a system/protocol doesn't necessarily mean bitcoin hasn't been hacked and is secure and safe.
Individual bitcoin systems have absolutely been compromised. BIG time.  Mtgox?  How many millions in peoples' entire life savings just *vanished*?  The encryption protocol is still secure, sure.  But the security around securing bitcoins and guaranteeing people won't lose their entire life savings is anything but secure.
To keep it secure, we need to trust that the "bank" has incredible amounts of redundancy.  Not just a backup server, but physical redundancy in multiple locations throughout the world.  We need to make sure these systems also have automatic responses systems that cut each other off and shut down in the event of an intrusion. The bitcoin may be secure, but if someone feels like breaking in just to take down the system and/or deleting them for the lulz, it isn't secure.
There's no insurance system around bitcoin either.  If you lose your bitcoin, it's gone.  If you lose your USD in an American bank, it's secured and insured by the FDIC.
So you want to secure it on your own in your own computer?  Cool. You just had a fire.  You're bankrupt because you put your bitcoins under your mattress.  Your house is not the equivalent security of the banking system.
There's countless other security issues that makes Bitcoin *far* from secure.  The encryption protocol *is* secure, but everything else around it is *not* secure and has been compromised quite a few times already.  Nothing has proven to me that its more secure than my US bank yet.

The joy of a traditional dollar is that it is completely anonymous.  You will never know the dollar bill in your wallet may have been in the hands of a murderer, stripper, drug dealer, politician, or charity.  Once it enters your hands, it has a new life with no trail.
What bothers me about BTC is it is completely traceable.  It may be anonymous, but it still has a trail.  There's *tons* of data out there.  All it will take is some really in-depth analytics and data mining to start figuring out ways to track transactions and figure out what you're getting your BTC from based upon the trail of transactions.
The fact that I may have a BTC on there and people can see that I'm not using it is bothersome.  I have a $100 bill in a safe that has been sitting there for 15 years.  No one will ever know it hasn't been touched.  Hell, no one will ever know where I got it form or why.
This needs to change.  It's things like this that makes me not feel comfortable with BTC yet.

I hate to be "that guy", but it wasn't because it was bitcoin, but this is more to do with that:
1. It was football, the most popular sport in America.
2. It was with 2 very large American colleges, including the second largest in the nation.
3. There was almost nothing else on TV. 
4. It was on ESPN.
The sponsorship has very little to do with whether someone is going to tune in to a game.  It's a big win to the sponsor if it has a very good competition between two major university football programs, but I don't think people specifically tune in *just* because the sponsor.  If anything, the sponsor name has become a joke to the teams who play it.  The "Beef O'Brady Bowl" use to be a big joke because the name alone.
To put this in perspective, the St. Petersburg Bowl (Official name for the Beef O'Brady/Bitcoin Bowl) has never had great viewership and attendance.  The inaugural year was South Florida vs. Memphis in 2008 - it's right down the road from S.Florida, and until this year the second largest attendance at only 25,000.  They expected 30,000 to attend this year, but only came up at 26,000.
After that, was UCF-Rutgers the year after only 28,000.  Since then, you've had Louisville-Southern Miss, Marshall-FIU, UCF-Ball State, and ECU-Ohio (NOT Ohio State). NC State-UCF was probably the biggest game they've hosted since UCF-Rutgers.
The article makes it like the bowl has been declining over 6 years - it's only been around for 6 years! It has always been one of the shittiest bowls to be in - a bowl that they have just because they need more bowls. I'm UCF alum, and I was disappointed to see the bowl we got (and even more disappointed in the loss).  
It's interesting about that it was the highest viewed advertisement of the night, but it's a bad statistical inference when you compare what it was up against on a night when historically the only thing on TV is college football, and people will watch it regardless.

I can't tell if your response is serious or satirical at the bitcoin community.
If it's serious, then learning these skills are not the answer. That's the job of the UX designers, which is to make it so IT functions are not hindering to the normal process.  This is the most neckbeard response ever.  You can't expect something that is more difficult or more work to be done or more knowledge to do as something that'll replace a simple process.
If "learn basic cryptography" is the solution for every single person in the world, then bitcoin is never going to be mainstream outside of this crowd.
And if the solution is more complex passwords, then this is going to be the most insecure system over the next few years.  We're at a point now that a password needs to be so complex and long for it to be secure enough to prevent against an average home computer from being able to brute force it in a reasonable time.  Give it a few more years, and one's ability to remember (or bother typing in) a long enough and complex enough password is not going to be feasible.
Come back down to earth.  Bitcoin isn't going to go mainstream until there's a simple enough and "Apple enough" solution for managing wallets/funds.

Give it another decade or 2, and UCF will have one of the largest alum bodies in the country.  We really only started getting big in the early 00s... and rapidly.

It would be a bargain to take them in at this point.

Still not secure. You're basically asking the same crowd as those on Facebook to your security. 
What part of "there is no transferred risk to an insurance" do you not understand? Bitcoin is not secure until all risk can be assumed by something like FDIC or a federally regulated insurance by the Bitcoin bank. 
It may be a low chance of it happening, but it's an extremely high issue if it happens. Therefore the risk is extremely high. With federally insured banks or credit unions, it's low possibility with low (moderate at best) issue to the user since its insured and they get every dime back. 
You lose your Bitcoin for whatever reason, there is no recovery or insurance. None. Like that, $100k can vanish either due to a bug or theft. There are legal protections to get you back your $100k with a traditional bank. No obligation legally exists that's controlled by any government to get you back that money win Bitcoin. You can maybe sue Coinbase and hope you get it back, but even that is a shit shot.

At that time is was **much** more of a speculation than an investment. "Speculation" is investor-speak for "gamble".
Even today, bitcoin is more of a speculative investment.  It's very volatile, and there isn't much in place to guarantee it'll always be around and/or in demand.  The value is almost completely from speculators who are hoarding bitcoins and introducing the scarcity.  The options to use bitcoin in legit settings are not exactly prolific yet. 
I hope it *does* become a real investment someday, but we need to stop kidding ourselves that this isn't still much more than gambling.

When bitcoin wins, the taxation system will be obliterated...
Care to explain? Because as far as I know, paper dollar bills right now don't have tracking devices and you still pay tax on it. Your income technically isn't tracked unless reported by your employer either, even if it's a complete digital transaction. 
So if bitcoin "wins", the tax system goes nowhere. You just now have your earnings reported in bitcoin and you need to pay taxes in bitcoin. You're still committing a crime if you evade paying your taxes in/on bitcoin.

I find your map to either be highly inaccurate or a misinterpretation of data.  China has 1.4 billion people as of 2013.  Bitcoin was *reaching* [100 million global users in 2016]( By your rationale, China's currency is more valuable because it has more users?  I'm not really sure what the amount of users have to do with the value. It really doesn't.  
Also, very regularly loves posting about how judges are ruling it isn't currency so it can't be taxed as currency... but also missing that it needs to be taxed as an asset.  So according to the hype that comes around here once in a while, comparing bitcoin to any real currency is not fair because bitcoin is an asset that you should be comparing to resource speculation - not currency.  
The methodology for whatever the hell it is you're trying to explain about bitcoin is flawed, and it's crap like that why so many don't take bitcoin seriously - the fanbase has no real economic understanding.

You're literally advocating tax evasion.
If you have an income, you pay taxes. So, if your income is bitcoin, your tax will be around 30% of your bitcoin income. Employers report this.
If you invest in commodities, you pay taxes.  Any legit market will report earnings on commodity speculation.
If you purchase an asset, you pay taxes.  If you buy from a legit source, you'll be charged a sales tax on this.
If you sell precious metals, you pay taxes.  You'll pay capital gains taxes. 
There's tons of other ways for Uncle Sam to make sure he's getting his fair share.  If you do not report earnings/sales/etc after a certain amount at all, then enjoy your complimentary stay at a building with other people who decided to not report it.  Good luck being a billionaire and avoiding this.
Also, if you're thinking you can skirt the system and not pay taxes, you're basically money laundering, which is very illegal.
While the tax system right now may be vague on it, you can guarantee between the courts, IRS, and regulators that they're planning for how to make sure you can't avoid paying taxes just by changing your form of currency to a digital one.
Finally, "taxation is a crime committed by government against its citizens"? Now I see - I was just arguing with a lunatic or a child who just read Ayn Rand for the first time. If you want to be part of any society, you pay taxes to protect yourself, your community, and have a functioning society.

Watson isn't as good as everyone thinks.  You don't just turn Watson on and throw a question at it. It needs a corpus and months/years of training for each and every single topic to be accurate enough.  It's incredibly expensive and labor-intensive. Even still, for the application of law, it would really only be a suggestion of laws which may apply with the confidence behind it.  
You'd still need lawyers to interpret the laws and fight for you.  Watson could at best cut down on trivial legal work or assist a lawyer, but just like medicine it isn't intended to replace doctors.  It's only a tool.
IBM came under heavy scrutiny from doctors and the medical industry when Watson initially came out and was proposed.  They were extremely nervous it would be the end of many medical professionals' careers.  They had to go through massive amounts of marketing and education that Watson isn't and more than likely never be a replacement, rather it's just a tool to guide. It's intent is to take away the trivial research so the professionals can focus on actually interpreting and making decisions intelligently... not just "gut instinct".

The cost of the research to lasso in an asteroid, the cost to do it, the cost of then launching to the asteroid, the cost of mining, the cost of returning the ore, and the cost of refining.
I'm no rocket-space-asteroid-mining scientist, so I'm sure there's many other costs and processes involved.  The cost of just lassoing it alone is said to be $2.6 billion.  
With all of those costs, you're not about to have a viable resource for obtaining gold.  The reason they want to mine asteroids in the distant future is to be able to obtain resources we're running low on and/or are unavailable on earth.  It has nothing to do with "OMG! GOLD!", especially since nowhere in your article did they mention "gold", rather platinums.
If anything, the resources on an asteroid will be ridiculously more expensive than those on earth, and they would not be used as a monetary system.
Why has gold traditionally been used throughout human history?  It is finite, rare, and resilient to time.  It isn't so rare though that it's impossible to obtain, and it isn't finite enough that there's not enough to be used on a large scale.
I get it. You want to help hype of bitcoin like it's the greatest thing in the course of human history and anyone who doesn't jump on board is going to be poor as their traditional US dollar becomes useless when bitcoin takes over.  But don't throw stupid outrageous speculation out there backed by a basic misunderstanding of economics and science.

What does being a MEDICAL Doctor have to do with knowing the first thing about finance and economics? Most MD's have the same background in those topics as a recent graduate in art. Hell, probably the same background in economics/finance as someone with no more than an associates. They really only need to take the gen ed courses in these topics at most.
I know a few medical doctors who don't know the first thing about anything outside of biology and the human body and can't learn how to operate a computer just to use the web. So yes, I think he can't learn about bitcoin based on the "dude is an M.D." credential alone.
