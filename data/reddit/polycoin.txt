Any suggestions on what proof of delivery could be used for digital goods + OpenBazaar. In other words how can a seller demonstrate that delivery of digital services-goods was completed as requested in case of disputes?

Totally unprofessional and un-professorial. As an educator, which he claims to be, aren't you supposed to just state the facts without personal bias? Shame.

Bitstamp=Centralization, i.e. goes against what Bitcoin in theory stands for. And they don´t help their case with this mediocre performance. Aren't they suppose to be better than the banks?

Thanks a bunch guys. Just found a major thread also addressing the question here: 
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:37:14
What about if someone uses Bitcoin tumblers? Aren't they supposed to make the genesis of Bitcoins untraceable?
@_date: 2014-04-05 11:59:36
First of all congratulations and the best of lucks on this endeavour.
I tried playing with the url: store.avalonic.com on my iPhone and the server does not seem to be responding. On the PC it does work. Maybe the Cupertino block is already in place?

TL/DR: (On her own words) 
Summary: Investors have been left high and dry holding on to plummeting bitcoin as a bug in the software has prevented them trading in the currency.

Hey...I would still call it a rally as per investors lingo...What, it did not happen as described?
From Investopedia
A period of sustained increases in the prices of stocks, bonds or indexes. This type of price movement can happen during either a bull or a bear market, when it is known as either a bull market rally or a bear market rally, respectively. However, a rally will generally follow a period of flat or declining prices.
@_date: 2014-02-03 00:47:15
I am with you on the consensus approach, and that was my reply too. So, the main difference is that Dogecoin never had the limit hardcoded in the protocol, right?

Probably it would be a good practice to always display the actual account by the QR. That way, at least you can check. I would never send money to a blind or unconfirmed address. But, that´s just me...

I still don't understand what´s the alleged issue with iPhones and Bitcoin. I´m using a regular iPhone (no jailbreak) and I downloaded the Blockchain client a few weeks ago from iTunes. I have tested send and receive BTC without any problems. Today I tested  sending from one of my wallets to  another at 1632WrDGD9PxJprgacoWmpnFN48tR4E4bN without problems.
So for me it's working ok. Am I missing something or I'm just lucky?

Not even one specific crime or criminals named in this fascist pamphlet. Just a bunch of generalities and baseless accusations on a traditional Soviet style, aimed at stopping operation of BTC-e.  
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:16:01
Absolutely legitimate concerns. WTF? Is the Bitcoin community just going to take Gox's ''word'' that 6% of all coins in existence just ''vanished''. What happens when they are injected back in the system? What happens if MK recalls his private key in 3-5 years? He gets to keep the heist? At least there must be a FULL disclosure of whatever the crap he had in store for people to at least be able to have some resource against this and future frauds.

Bitcoin is a niche market. What better way of finding peers transacting in Bitcoin than via a specialized app for that niche?
@_date: 2015-11-15 01:50:23
OB is better than a self hosted site because your store runs on a platform designed for discovery of the store itself and the products you offer. It is a network.
