Yea, agreed they're using the "spend" part and ignoring the "save" part.
But if they were to do it, it *would* help; spending during downturns does help the economy, but it just needs the saving during upturns to keep from growing the debt.
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:22:34
That's not strictly true.  There are federations of industry participants that may not trust each other to operate in the best interest of all, while still all agreeing that only industry participants should be allowed to interact with the blockchain.
That's why it's called "federated" because it's not strictly "centralized" and therefore some of the requirements for trust have been removed.  Additionally, the "federated" aspect can impact only the *participation* and not the *algorithm*, which can still provide for a blockchain that isn't easily tampered with by a single participant.
By your logic the bitcoin blockchain isn't trustless because all the miners could collude to alter the chain, which means we have to trust the miners, right?

Keynesian economics is taking advantages of dips in price; that's all.  It literally states that spending by the government should increase when the economy busts and that it should decrease when the economy booms.  It is an attempt to smooth the business cycle but it closely matches what you should do in your own home because "spending" includes purchasing infrastructure and hiring people, both whose costs drop in the bust part of the business cycle.
In your own home, it would go like this.  Beef's on sale for $1.00 a pound?  You should buy 40 pounds.  No beef on sale?  Don't buy any.  On a large scale, this would smooth out the beef industry's boom/bust cycle (assuming it had one) because when the market was saturated, prices would drop and people would grab more, increasing demand and bringing the market down from its saturation point, and as the supply decreased, fewer would buy, preventing the price from shooting up too high.
The *problem* is not the concept, it is the *practice*.  In *practice*, politicians never *stop* spending money, so the *retract* part of the Keynesian model basically just never happens.  But when the economy inevitably retracts, they call for more spending to stimulate it, realizing they never set aside any money during the booms to account for that spending, sending us further into debt.

That metric alone is not very meaningful.  If someone is working 30 hours per week at a part-time job, they're "employed".  Does that mean they are making enough to make ends meet?  No.
I'd argue that policies like Obama era health care requirements (provide benefits to employees working over X hours per week) force employers to lower the hours for each individual worker, requiring more workers on the payroll.  Does this mean the economy is doing better?  No, we're just sharing the same hours with more people, reducing each person's weekly take-home pay enough to afford another worker.

But we do know how to point out correlations
@_date: 2019-08-14 15:33:59


False dichotomy; it should be possible for me to work more hours without being offered benefits.  Insurance is a BIG expense, so the discrepency between 36 hours and 45 hours is no longer 9 hours, it's 9 hours PLUS a few hundred a month, not to mention that many companies don't even have an offering, so adding one would incur additional overhead.


You're arguing the wrong point.  The point isn't that the economy can't offer more, the point is that artificially constraining people from offering certain compensation creates unintended consequences and skews metrics.  I'm not saying the economy is *suffering*, far from it.  I'm saying that data is increasingly skewed because of government interference.


Another false dichotomy.  I have more choices than *accept or leave*.  Not only can I leave for other countries that have a much lower unemployment rate and better societal benefits, but I can also do what I can to change my country for the better (as I see it); mechanisms for change are literally built into our society.


Feel free to sit back and enjoy the status quo; some people are *always* trying to improve for the better, and we shouldn't discourage them from doing so.

DCA means "Dollar Cost Averaging" and does *not* have a stipulation that you buy at *set* time intervals, but rather you spread your buys out over time instead of buying once.


You don't have to be at the bottom of a dip, buying when RSI is oversold would be a good way to do it; no crystal ball necessary.  You aren't trying to time the bottom, just buying after a big drop.
@_date: 2019-06-04 14:12:26
DCA can be done based on time or based on market state.  Lots of people *buy the dip*, which means they buy directly after a drop.  This is still DCA because they're buying a little at a time.

Excluding emotions from the equation is a good idea. 


Ok, but in practice how does that work for a laymen?  Someone who basically set a recurring buy order with Coinbase?  What I'm saying is that incorporation of the market state presents a problem from an automatic standpoint for many.  Additionally, you don't have to be "subjective" about it.  You can be *objective* about what you use to modify your recurring purchase.  Like, say you have a $50 recurring weekly buy.  When the price is 10% lower than the high during some previous timeframe (say a week), then that week you double your buy to $100.  Or, if you're a little more "trader-savy", you can use some indicator.  If weekly RSI is below 30, double your buy.


**That** term is far more ambiguous; a dip can mean a lot of things depending on context.
I'm just saying, modifications to DCA'ing based on the state of the market doesn't disqualify the method as a "DCA" method; alterations are allowed and it can still be called DCA'ing.  
I think we both agree that removing emotion from the equation is the end goal; if you're buying because you "have a feeling it will go up from here" in the short term, you're probably going to "have a feeling it will go down from here" too, and get shredded by chop.  Instead, buy slowly and methodically (even if that method includes market state) to accumulate a position if you believe that the long-term trend is up.
@_date: 2019-06-04 15:21:14




What if, instead of using an automatic modification, you do it by using a "manual" modification?  As in, buy more during downturns?  When "buying the dip", you don't have to try to *time* the market; instead you *react* to what's already happened (it already dipped).  Maybe it dips further and you buy more.  Maybe it doesn't and you revert.
Buying the dip is a less formal way of saying "modify your purchases to increase during downtrends and decrease during uptrends"

Yes, but I don't think Cryptos are analogous to dot com companies.  I think cryptos are analogous to layer 4 OSI protocols (TCP/IP, UDP).  Lots of early protocols for transmitting data were created, but only a few won out.
You don't need to pick the "winning company", you need to look and see which crypto you think will form the core of money communication.  At this point I have a hard time seeing how Bitcoin won't be *the* major player in that arena.  All the other cryptos are either basically direct clones with minor tweaks or built for an entirely different purpose.  It seems to me like Bitcoin has become the de-facto standard in the transfer of ~~money~~ value, much like TCP/IP has become the de-facto standard in communications on the internet.  UDP has its place, much like some secondary crypto will have its place (I'm betting Ethereum will play that role).

Because we need an alternative to inflationary.  The *reason* dollars have inflation (or at least, the purported reason) is that the government believes it is more beneficial for society as a whole for you to hold on to *other things* besides dollars.  When dollars have a disincentive to be held, they get used (and not squirrelled away), which increases the velocity of money and thus GDP and the gov.t tax base.
Traditional things to "invest" when you want to squirrel away wealth are gold and real estate.  Since real estate has a ton of baggage (need to have the right location, property taxes, etc), gold and precious metals have been one of the few assets that aren't tied to the performance of a company that the "plebians" could invest in to preserve wealth.
Except precious metals are not easily divisible, not fungible (or not as fungible as dollars; some gold/silver coins have a much higher value than others for numismatic reasons, for instance), difficult to transact with long-distance and easily forgeable.
Bitcoin solves *all* of those problems.  However, without the deflationary aspect, it'd just be another dollar; incentivizing people to throw it away as fast as the could.  We *already have that*.  We need *something else*.

Part of negative interest rates *is* deflation.  In some countries in Europe (like Switzerland), their franc's strength makes it difficult to export.

I'm not *missing* it, it's implied in the idea of a *medium of exchange*.  Also, fungibility is in the graph, you just didn't look at the second half.


Absolutely, which is why USD has a built-in inflation mechanism.  That's good for *money* that has no other value besides a medium of exchange but it is not *necessary* for a good to be a medium of exchange.  In other words, it's *good* for our primary medium of exchange to be inflationary, but we need alternatives that *are not* inflationary, and those alternatives need to be a store of value.  We already have stores of value; gold, real estate, art, stocks/investment funds.  However, each of those stores of value has different reasons why they cannot be used as a medium of exchange; gold and art are hard to store securely, hard to transport and can be forged, real estate is *immovable*, art, real estate and stocks are not fungible.  Bitcoin can be a medium of exchange because it A) has value B) it can be transported easily and C) is fungible.  But *it doesn't have to be* a medium of exchange; its primary valuation is as a store of value.


Nothing has *inherent value*; even things that produce value have different values to different people.


That doesn't track; you probably mean "confidence" as in where you can use it; and fungibility only means one coin is equal to another, separate coin because they are the same unit; that's again not the same thing as whether or not it's accepted *at all*.

Bitcoin is issued to miners who find blocks as a reward.  This is how bitcoin is distributed.  The reward is basically "static", meaning it doesn't fluctuate from block to block.  But we can't have a static reward exist forever if we want to have a finite total supply, so the reward has to be reduced somehow.  "Halving" refers to the mechanism bitcoin uses to reduce that reward.  Every certain # of blocks, the reward is cut in "half*.  Eventually it will get close enough to zero that the next time it is supposed to be cut in half, it will instead become 0, and no new bitcoin will ever be rewarded.

First of all, there are other ways to reduce throughput, like transaction spamming.  And, as we have seen, reduction of throughput doesn't necessarily affect price, so this validator is playing an interesting game if he thinks he "knows" the direction an asset is going to go.

Absolutely, it's *not* a very good medium of exchange.


Right.  It's a good *store of value* but we have better *mediums of exchange*.  See, the US Dollar is a *really good* store of value; it's value changes at a slow and predictable rate (or it should).  Storing your wealth in the US dollar is, at times, a great decision depending on the investment climate because it's *stable*.  If USD didn't have any *store of value* properties, it would be a horrible medium of exchange, because it wouldn't hold its value.
You have to have *store of value* to become a *medium of exchange*; you can't be a medium of exchange without out.  However, being a *store of value* doesn't mean you automatically become a *medium of exchange* (like real estate or art).


Absolutely; the double coincidence of wants is about a medium of exchange.  But again, that medium *has to be a relatively good store of value* first, or else no one will use it as a medium of exchange.

Because people will prefer it over other money, which increases its acceptance from merchants, and simultaneously people will not want to spend it, which will increase its value.


Nominal Value + Speculation of Nominal Value = Ordinal Value
Pretty straightforward I'd say.


Let's clear up terminology; nominal value is the value of people using it, whereas ordinal value is the price, right?  Therefore ordinal value is simply a reflection of the sum of what people need it for plus what people think other people will value it in the future.  So ordinal value *necessarily* goes up if both nominal value goes up and sentiment goes up.


No it doesn't; not "ordinally", at least.  Sitting on inventory *increases* the ordinal value of the commodity as you are restricting supply without affecting demand.  


I fully agree with this sentiment.  I'd point to this quote:


First valued for purposes *other* than their monetary function; they had to *have value* to be used as a medium of exchange.  People need to *want it* **and** to *know other people want it* in order for them to consider it to be a medium of exchange.
Then we move onto this next quote:


This is the point I'm making; the *continuity* of bitcoin is a function of its technical properties and of men's estimations concerning other men's future valuations (Nominal Value + Speculative Value = Ordinal Value, see above).




What?  Quite the opposite; as other currencies devalue, sellers will require *more* of them for the buyer to be able to buy it.  The *nominal value* will not decrease due to a decrease in alternative currencies' devaluations, nor will the *speculative value*.  Only the measure of that value will change as the value of the alternative currency changes.


No; we don't see that with any other commodity, and in fact, the *devaluation* of any given currency is axiomatically it's value falling with respect to other commodities.  We *necessarily* see prices for *all* commodities rise because the currency is just a measure of future value, and if that drops, then more will be needed to match the value.  That's why you saw wheelbarrows of German Marks after WW1; people didn't *drop* the price of bread; they *increased* the price.


I honestly don't think this will ever happen.  The Federal Government has the ability to effectively "burn" money and increase the value.  They've given themselves the levers to control the value of their currency.  Much like Tether, which theoretically destroys Tethers when the value goes up and prints more tethers when the value goes down; the US doesn't necessarily have this problem.  If inflation gets out of hand, they put the breaks on it by increasing interest rates, which slows the rate of increase of money.  Plus, the government will never take Bitcoin directly for tax purposes, which sets a floor on demand.


I'm not sure of the timescales, but I know that a global, permissionless, censorship-free method of exchange and storing value has a much higher *nominal* value than the price reflects, which is why I'm long-term bullish on price.  I watch the market closely, and if I feel the network is being fully utilized, I'll believe we have reached the top.

Oh yea I agree that's not how he meant it.  I'm more describing how he *misunderstood* it.  The capability *technically* exists much like the capability for the US government to massively reduce our debt by printing massive amounts of money.  Just because it's possible doesn't mean it's *plausible*.

You're saying that *all* validators will block transactions?  How is that any different than POW?

Yes, if price doubles as reward halves, the end result is the same number of dollars.

There is no *medium* of exchange without that medium *having value*.  Being a medium of exchange adds value, but it's not necessary.  Otherwise gold would have no value because it's no longer a medium of exchange.  We see quite the opposite though; a store of value is valuable by tautology but also by function; we *need* a place to store accumulated wealth.  
The *only* requirement to attain value is that *other people value it*.  You need [*more* than that]( to achieve status as a medium of exchange:
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:26:51


I'd refer you to [this post](
Holding implies a forecasted higher valuation.  This gives the coin *current* value because we know people will buy it *at this price point*.  *THAT'S* what you need to create a medium of exchange.  The guy willing to *buy* pizza for 10,000 bitcoins wasn't the true hero, the guy willing to *sell* pizza for 10,000 bitcoins was.

Open up new exchange with the same software and a quick re-branding.  Tada, new exchange, new reputation.

No, the argument is *on the page*.  


I understand it well enough; do I have to reproduce the entirety of the page or can you just follow the link?


Only if you're selected as a validator.  That's the same with POW; you could apply this exact same statement to POW.


Stop what?  This is kind of incoherent.


Neither was "POS isn't an alternative to POW"; you got what you gave.  If you expand on why "using stake to determine validators instead of work" isn't like, the definition of *alterantive*, then I'll have something to actually argue against.

Before debit cards were an easy thing, you're exactly right.  Locking those dollars into a bank made them less liquid.  Cash used to be preferable for this exact reason (among others) and is one reason why interest used to be higher; people needed to be incentivized to lock their funds for a time.  As debit and credit become more ubiquitous, that problem eases because you can more easily transfer in/out of said account, so it's not as "locked" as it used to be.
That's an absolutely perfect analogy.

This is the "nothing at stake" problem, not the "Stake Grinding" problem.
And the nothing at stake problem requires, as I said in the beginning, a "Rube Goldberg Machine" to get it to work.  I was being facetious, but they *do* have a solution to it.  From the link I gave previously:


@_date: 2019-05-13 15:13:16
Because more people know it?  Because so far people haven't really cracked down on Bitcoin so the risk/reward ratio is low?  Because there are a lot more onramps for Bitcoin?

You may be right.

How do you establish "stability" of value before you even establish "value"?  That doesn't make sense, and I think you're putting the cart before the horse.  How can something *even have an ordinal value* until it retains some kind of value?


How does appeal not at least strongly correlate with "ordinal" value?  The higher the appeal, the higher price that can be demanded.  That's supply and demand at its core.


I agree that stability increases the appeal for many people.  This comes naturally as "market cap" increases.  Once bitcoin has become valuable enough, large market players won't have the ability to sway it as effectively.  We need *higher ordinal valuation* in order to increase stability, which means we need *more people to hoard it*.  And not just "more hoarding", but more *people* hoarding.  The more spread out the commodity comes, the harder it is for a single participant to move the market.  But that means we need more people invested in it.  Which requires that it *maintains its value over time*.


I was basically with you until here.


If you're sitting on it, you expect that it *won't* lose value (else you'd get rid of it).  Why would that *reduce* the buying power of others?  You're more likely to take bitcoin over other currencies; Gresham's law and all that.


Appeal and relative valuation are strongly correlated; if you want something, you're willing to pay for it.  The more you want it, the more you're willing to pay.


What?  Gold *was* the currency.


Neither of these things are true if there is demand for gold.

Are you talking about grinding?  You yourself said that grinding spends energy, so you *do* have something being expended.  But, the original link I shared (the one you said wasn't valid because I linked it instead of rewriting it for you) has like 3 different proposals for how to discourage that.

I feel like this rollback suggestion, while receiving a lot of attention, is absolutely nonsensical.  Ethereum, years ago, was able to do it because the majority of the stakeholders also invested in the DAO, and adoption was *tiny*.  Neither of those is true of this situation.
Keep calm everyone, that shit ain't happening.
The hack was a legitimate transfer in the eyes of Bitcoin.  The *whole point of Bitcoin* is that the code dictates the rules.  If we can find the person or people who did it, the *legal* processes in place can "roll back" the hack by seizing assets or whatever recourse they choose.  But as far as Bitcoin is concerned, the transaction happened.
There are some drawbacks to an immutable ledger.  This is one of them.  But there are *other* systems that trade this drawback for other drawbacks.  If you want a system that can roll back a transaction, use the current banking system.
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:17:16


Sure, but, again, once the single hop is destroyed, ambiguity is introduced, and the thought exercise falls apart.


Has this happened *at all*?  Lots of transactions occur on monero and zcash but I haven't heard of people having their coins seized on suspicion?


Again, is this happening?

The lightning network faces the same problem every network faces; the *network* effect.  It's a bit worse with Lightning because you have to lock funds to use it.  That means those funds can't be used outside the Lightning network unless you cash out.
The more people who use Lightning, the more people WILL use Lightning.  But don't expect most people to use it until it's default in their wallets.

I'd say you have to look at the fee structure.  If fees are high and still aren't being confirmed, I'd say that's congested.  If fees are low but there's 100,000 "no fee" transactions, I'd say that's not congested.

It won't.  It'll always be a "reserve asset" like gold.  It just doesn't make sense for governments to give up the control they have gained by taking over their national currencies and deciding how many to print.  Mark my words; will never happen.
I *do* see it replacing gold or at least becoming gold-like; large nation states holding large quantities in reserve.  Maybe an IMF style currency; large nations trading it like they do with gold.  But as a regular currency for common folk?  I just don't see it.
