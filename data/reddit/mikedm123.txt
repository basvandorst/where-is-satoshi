I’m pretty sure this is just a photoshopped white board from an older season.

Lol right. Not to be a jerk but like wtf do you think the answer is-
“O I woulda bought way less bitcoin and probably make sure I sold my ethereum at 90 bucks”

“Nowhere to go but up now”?
Lolz do you know how numbers work?

Very true. I guess what I’m getting at is it seems with fiat the fees seem way more “ disguised” and merchant geared or non user/client geared. Most people don’t even realize or think about them. With crypto it just seems they are very out in the open and apply to everyone. I just think it might end up becoming a problem, especially if people want to use cryptos as a primary means of exchange.

Right. Straight scumbag. Not cool at all.

I feel you.  Luckily I picked up a little more during that drop but now I have been waiting for like a week to exchange another (smaller) batch  of fiat into BTC. Same exact thing- Keep telling myself, oh just wait for a small correction then buy. Said that at 9, and 10 last night, and now this morning.... I’m about to just do the same....

Lulz *repeatably pokes Coinbase with a stick*
pretty much.

Guess I can cancel my Coinbase alert for BTC is under 7k I set up literally like 10 days ago lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:45:51
Hm, true. It’s worked in the (semi recent) past but I wouldn’t put anything past BOA.

Bc you don’t even know what’s going to happen long term...
What if you take the loss on BTC, swap it and BCH and then it reverses BTC starts to climb and BCH starts to fall?
Start taking losses and fees left and right trying to ride the wave of the day?
Na, my 2 cents-just diversify into both and put the most eggs in the basket you personally feel most confident in after doing your homework and just Hold Hold Hold.

Easy fix. Just rob a bank buy BTC and put all the coin on a hard wallet before they get to you. 
Do your time, come out, and enjoy those 50000% returns 20 years later.

Same exact situation here, no confirmation email either. I’m going to definitely guess no based on today so far but not 100% certain..
