No there isn't. How I go about trading is as follows:
1) I look at the Daily/4Hour to identify the big picture trend. In the case of BTC/USD, it's clearly bearish. 
2) I plot out Support and Resistance on the 1 Hour. 
3) I execute based on the 15/30 Min to get a nice pinpoint entry (this is what I shared above).
I could have easily done without the 30 minute (but not the higher timeframes). With enough chart time, you can decipher what is happening on the 4 hour by only looking at the daily, the hourly by only looking at the 4 hour, and so on. Remember that all time frames show the same thing, the price of whatever currency pair or stock you're looking at. 
here is an example of what I mean. Same conclusion of my first markup. 
I've never used HMA. I'm generally not a fan of indicators.

how can you say that when it's down $2000 for the day lmao

Is it recovering and going to make a new high? or is it undergoing a correction after trending down so strongly, only to continue the downtrend? I'd go with the latter. 
Who benefits from bitcoin surging up? Retail investors like people in this sub. Unfortunately, retail investors don't have any buying power in the grand scheme of things. Be very careful trading next week. right now seems like a great time to buy.... so banks and institutions will have pending sell orders as price continues to push up again (based on market structure, probably ~$15.5k) so they can get premium pricing for their short positions.

Yuppp. Nice profit to end the week for me :)

nope. I see that the trend is bearish on the daily, 4 hour, and 1 hour. I see that today is Friday, and you don't see trend reversals at the end of the week. Price is gathering liquidity for a further push down at the start of the New York trading session.  It will at least test the low of this week if not break past it. We'll see, I'm a forex trader, not a crypto expert like everyone in this sub. I have sell orders at $15,200 with my stop loss at break even.
