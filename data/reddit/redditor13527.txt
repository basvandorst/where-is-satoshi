Microsoft was a part of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, right?

I have contacted: 
when i had a problem, they responded fast, you may try that too.

Nope, 17k again, Monday, 17:30, CET.

I personally think that there will be another dip, which will go to 13k. But that will be once more, and eventually go only up from there on.

Clickbait. They are considering making Bitcoin a payment option on eBay, but that is for some time in the future.

This maybe will help:

Don't panic sell. It will be up again :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:26:13
That makes sense. We need more people like you :D
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:56:49
Hahahahahaha :)))
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:20:42
Well, the new era has officially started :)

In my personal experience, they have been extremely professional. However, upvote from me too, hope they fix that as soon as possible.

If it pops, it won't be anything lower than 13k.

What about going from A ---&gt; B, and from B back to A, for one single transaction?

Why you did not choose an exchange that allows direct card funding? The fees are way lower compared to those using SWIFT / SEPA.

I prefer CEX.io - got verified fast and they seem very professional.

I am also new here, but in this sea of "JOIN THE ICO ---&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **** THE NEXT BIG REVOLUTION IS HERE******" you will have to do a lot of reading and research, in order to choose the right coins to invest in, which have a high potential to reach a good value and yield a good ROI.

Everyone has heard of Bitcoin / cryptocurrencies in general, but that's all. They have only heard. No plan to research, read, invest, anything like that.

Maybe because it was the first, maybe its name is suggestive that it should be "THE ONE", maybe because of market cap and developed price, i don't know.

They will usually ask for documents that you provided during your verification process and reset the 2FA code.
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:37:32
I think the major part - yes.
