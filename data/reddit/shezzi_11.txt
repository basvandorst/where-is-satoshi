not quite. These are the partitions of the sd card. I'm interested in the partition of the HDD. Probably the  `sudo fsck /dev/sda1` will fix the issue with the corrupted file. I would give it a try. Do a `sudo reboot` after that. If errer was fixed still continue with reinstalling docker as you already deleted some files. Don't format your HDD if you have open channels as those funds will be lost if you do so.

open `sudo nano /etc/fstab` and comment the two last lines (starting with */dev/sda1* and */mtn/data*) out by adding a ` to the front. Then reboot. This disables swapping and mounting and fsck should work. If it worked remove the ` again.

The corrupted file is located in /mnt/data which is the directory of your HDD. Imo you can backup your microSD card completely. Do you have any open lightning Channels? If not you might want to format your HDD as EXT4 like with `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1` but be careful, this wipes all data. So you have to sync the chain again which takes like a week or so and you have to input your mnemonic phrase again and probably fix the settings file again  [

OK docker is essential. It's the software Casa is running on top. I recommend to copy &amp; paste all commands from this file:
This reinstalls docker and reboots your PI. type `docker --version` to verify the reinstallation was successful.
Edit: Or first try only these five commands:
`sudo systemctl stop docker`  
`sudo systemctl daemon-reload`  
`sudo systemctl restart docker`  
`sudo systemctl enable casa.service`  
`sudo reboot`
Edit 2:
The logs you updated looks for me like you might have a problem with the HDD (sda1). There are errors with the EXT4 formatting. Docker will only start if the HDD was mounted. Can you type
    sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda
and show me the output? Depending on the output you can repair the partition with
    sudo fsck /dev/sda1

I assume you try to connect to your casa node via [ . The easiest solution might be to try it with the direct ip like [ . You can get the IP if you use tools like *angry ip scanner* or log in to you router and check the connected devices.
If hat doesn't work you can try to connect to your node via SSH and check where the error is located. Shutdown your Node, remove the microSD card and put it into your PC. Create a empty text file with the name `ssh` in the boot partition and save it. Put the SD card back to your PI and boot it. Now you can connect to your PI via SSH. In Windows you need a program like [putty.org]( . Under Linux/Mac just open the terminal and insert `ssh casa or `ssh casa In Putty only enter `casa or `casa and click Open Connection. Accept the fingerprint and enter the password **casa**. now you can check some log outputs like with `docker logs manager` or `docker logs lnapi` (`docker container ls` for all available containers). Check all for errors. If you find an error let me know or check this site for a fix:  [
In the absolute worst case run this command:  [` to wipe your device. This results in a loss of funds of all your opened Lightning Channels. Or I can send you a backup from my sd card I made before setting up my Node. You can flash it and everything should work again as expected.
After you've resolved your issue don't forget to disable ssh again. type `sudo raspi-config` \&gt; 5. Interfacing &gt; 2. SSH &gt; NO &gt;&gt; Finish and then type `sudo reboot`
I also recommend to do a backup of the sd card.

Yes, remove the top cover. This is clipped in so you might need a bit of force to remove it. After that on the side there's a small slider or how this is called with a raspberry pi logo on it. Remove this as well and there you can access the microSD card.
