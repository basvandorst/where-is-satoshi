You must be so wise. Do tell us more.
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:54:30
Yes there are anonymous cryptos that are used on the dark web and aid corruption, that doesn't mean there is no application for blockchain. Blockchain can ensure there is no corruption if applied correctly. You also don't understand how it works.
Please go read about Dapps and blockchain before commenting. Ethereum blockchain offers far more than just a virtual currency.

@_date: 2018-01-11 17:43:29
Lots of Dapps are starting be build on Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum might not be the future, but one of the cryptos are the future of currency, and privacy, as well as ridding the world of corruption.  Smart contracts are a very interesting concept.
Bitcoin has also proven it's versatility and security, all it needs now is to be able to scale.
Whether investing large sums in intangible cyptos as commodity is a good idea is debatable.

Pretty odd feeling right? All these late adopters, far more educated people in my office than I, are waffling on about their fractions of Bitcoin, meanwhile im losing and  gaining thousands every minute.

Well if your transacting in BTC it's very likely that it could at least loosen the grip. 
The point is BTC is not tied to an economy. As a South African I look at Zimbabwe, the country just north of SAs border, its has a virtually non-existant economy with a literally worthless currency. The currencys value vapourised within a span of 5-10 years. The South African government is behaving much like the Zimbabwean government at present, so you can be sure I have exported a percentage of my wealth out of South African Rands and into crypto and other investments. Despite winning the Rugby World Cup recently the outlook for the economy of SA is bleek to say the least, I'm hedging my bets.
Edit: Not a fan of reality I see

Im buying this dip. Gonna be sweet next year
@_date: 2018-06-08 05:08:53
Rule number 1. Never call back, especially after 1 sec calls. Its known that you potentially get charged massively for callng back after the 1 sec calls that hang up. 
Well just saying I used to get spam calls and after a campaign of blocking numbers for a while I just dont seem to get them anymore. Most call centres seem to use numbers from a pool that get used for various advertising campaigns, they arent commercial phone numbers.
Spoofed numbers Im not so sure, doesn't happen a lot in my experience.
The BTC exchange seems like legitimate solution, but a bit overly convoluted. Perhaps if it was a  feature that you dont have to interact with, I dont have time to be paying people back cents.
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:18:50
Hang up and block the number. I hardly ever get spam calls anymore.
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:39:07

@_date: 2019-10-03 11:58:58
There is an intrinsic value to BTC, it'll never be zero unless a "Bitcoin killer" comes along.
@_date: 2019-08-25 06:28:24
They take your private keys when they "connect your wallet to the mining server" and steal your bitcoin. Simple. If they create a wallet they will have your private keys. If you give them your private keys you can kiss your bitcoin goodbye. Don't trust any bitcoin schemes.
@_date: 2018-06-08 04:57:07
Maybe I don't get many of those. I also keep my data pretty safe. I also dont enter my phone number anywhere on the internet. 
I just find the whole receiving and giving of btc/crypto on call is a little convoluted, maybe the whitelist story will work but even that may not be ideal to maintain and pay randos backs.
@_date: 2019-08-25 06:32:36
A wallet password means nothing if they have your wallets private key.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:07:52
Is the value of 1 BTC higher than it costs to mine 1 BTC? Yes. Why? Because people believe Bitcoin to be far more valuable.  Belief = Perception = Intrinsic.

BTC can only die if people refuse to pay less than it costs to mine, and I only see that happening if a Bitcoin killer comes along, or Bitcoin is somehow hacked.
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:43:46
[Wrong again]( Perception creates intrinsic value in the case of Bitcoin, it naturally has a value because people believe it does...Just like the USD.

In my mind If you're day trading you dont care about the price you care about the gains, log graph seems to make more sense. If you've made a % gains then sell or vise versa. If Im holding it seems to be better to look at the price I bought in at and price I get out at.
Maybe I don't  understand the graph.
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:16:46
Log scale makes sense for day traders, not really for hodlers.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:04:36
Correct. But when BTC price stabalises are you investing? No, you're saving.
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:42:18
Thanks. Thats more understandable.
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:28:47
There are still only 21 mil BTC, if it became a viable global currency users would have to share what BTC is available, meaning the price would be pretty freaking high. IF.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:34:40
There are denominations called Satoshis
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:33:00
If I sell it's guaranteed to go.up. 100%. I am convinced I single handedly can move the market. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:14:52
Well Im not sad I bought BTC.  Im just sad I didnt sell it high amd buy low again.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:48:59
I bet you also said it wouldn't hit $20k. Captain Cocksure to the rescue.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:25:52
Im dying here
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:51:59
You think uptake is only worthwhile if bringing highly enlightened people to BTC? If that was true Bitcoin would be worthless. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:11:37
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:49:17
Wow profound. Financial geniuses all over the internet today.  
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:16:26
Depends when you bought Bitcoin not so?
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:46:45
No shit
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:44:00
Only got enough BTC for a rubber dingy, can I join the club?
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:38:14
Asking the real questions here 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:02:00
Whoa! For real? Far out!
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:17:19
Welcome to investing. Hindsight is a forbidden word. 
@_date: 2019-09-27 02:51:27
No it's not.
@_date: 2019-09-11 12:10:32
Lambo sounds
@_date: 2018-07-09 04:28:03
Gonna be a feeding frenzy. Could be a massive pump and dump a coming.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:43:52
Shhhh dammit
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:02:31
TUL wrong
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:01:51
Blockchain has plenty applocation though
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:44:59
Need something like decentralized regulation, which I think is for the most part is how BTC works by itself, but the concept doesnt apply across cryptos.
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:01:45
A contract by the lender is drawn up. Just like a bank loan.
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:08:06
I'd take BTC as a salary. I'd never have to pay tax again(other than maybe VAT). Thats 39% of my earnings saved, it wouldn't really matter if BTC price fluctuates by 30%.
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:03:12
Your sentiment is not the average sentiment. So no we dont agree, and yes you'll wait till sentiment dictates the value.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:48:41
What would we have done without that piece of information? Lordy!!
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:55:48
It was death cross going to zero 3 weeks ago.
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:13:27
Even with the dip in price Im sitting with 5 times profit. Thats better than any bank will ever give you. Sold a little to now reduce exposure, but kept enough.
If BTC goes to zero Ive lost virtually nothing.  If it moons Im a millionaire. How you like them apples?
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:42:25
Sometimes there's obvious price drivers that I've missed.
Does anybody really know? Only the whales may know. Clearly you don't.
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:54:38
Yes why?? Would also like to know.
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:17:59
You think traders dont invest in crypto? Lol. Ok.
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:23:58
If only you were involved sooner. Shame buddy, now all you get is to sit and troll.
@_date: 2018-04-01 09:10:57
I think you misunderstand. A community vote would be decentralised. Markets can be easily manipulated if you can print coin and exhange them for legitimate coin. Tether has already been accused of it. Also millions of various shitcoins are not really creating value. Blockchain apps yes, shitcoin has no real value.
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:08:36
The concept of money lending is no different with Bitcoin, Bitcoin is just a currency that gets lent.
Pretty sure banks generate a shit load of FUD and are buying up BTC as the price drops. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:51:45
Fair enough. But don't sit and downplay the validity of cryptocurrency. 
The current monetary systems around the world are flawed. The reserve banks will have to change how they operate to manage the compounding debt ceilings before complete collapse. 
I'm also just anarchist, I have lost faith in governments.
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:28:31
"Bitcoin is dead". Next breath "Technology giant invests in crypto ASIC miners".
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:26:00
Oh you dont like them apples? I certainly do.
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:16:26
Therefore you're a [nocoiner]( You sit on the sidelines and give your uninformed opinion.
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:01:37
I got caught hodling a couple bags. Sold some low too like a dick. Not selling now till at least over 12k, and even then Ill just profit take a little. Fuck it, I believe in BTC and I'll definitely spend it when it doesn't cost a truckload per transaction and the price stabilizes. For now I hodl what I haven't been FUDded out of.
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:03:41
Nocoiner? Or did you invest at $20k? 
@_date: 2018-04-25 04:26:10
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE!?
@_date: 2018-04-02 05:06:32
[So savage. Cut me so deep.](
@_date: 2018-04-02 04:55:59
I'm really not sure what argument is. A printable coin has the potential to devalue all crypto if its allowed on exchanges. Thats fact, not my opinion.
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:24:28
You seem to know what you're talking about. Regulation and decentralization are like oil and water, not sure how Bitcoin will assimilate.
@_date: 2018-04-01 08:20:20
Agreed. Exchanges need to have a decentralized regulation policy where a coin cannot be traded on exchanges unless its meets a rigourous set of standards and passes a community vote. The abilty to exchange shitcoin for bitcoin is also crippling crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:06:10
Jeeze that is a gamble. Spose it could 10x.
@_date: 2018-04-25 04:59:20
Everyone is so clever until they are not.
@_date: 2019-05-13 05:41:21
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:31:20
Thank you.
I've seen them, but damn they are pricey. Can't I just generate a wallet and keep in on a flash drive or 2.
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:13:46
He may not be, but damn it doesn't get more sleazy than that guy.
@_date: 2018-12-25 04:34:00
That's just mean :D
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:55:38
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:24:04
Do I need a browser add-on? I don't see any option to pay with BTC, it defaults to trying to use my credit card.
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:59:49
What else floats in water?
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:34:02
Would have made a better episode
@_date: 2019-05-20 05:46:37


This is the biggest problem in South Africa at the moment.
@_date: 2018-12-25 04:35:32
Bitcoin not shitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-10 03:44:29
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:21:56
Bit harsh. Not everyone can see the forest for the trees.
@_date: 2019-05-13 05:41:59
Probably best not to advertise it on social media though
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:35:02
Thank you
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:13:34
Is Jaxx a safe wallet? How can I generate a wallet that is safe if not?
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:08:13
Am I the only hodler who think these memes are shit. I mean I don't mind memes but these are shit.
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:10:29
Convenient. Won't be using that platform.
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:27:39
Integrity. I view it as decentralized currency not tied to any government. I bet Venezuelans and Zimbabweans would have loved to invest in Bitcoin before their government sank their local economies.
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:12:23
Regulation will follow. Government have a way of sticking their filthy hands in everyones pie.
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:24:29
They weren't wrong
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:41:35
Shut it
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:48:39
When to sell is the problem
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:43:21
Draggin balls
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:34:32
Cheers, much appreciated
@_date: 2019-05-24 05:52:39
Holding enough to want a secure wallet. We have a very good secure exchange here but I have my fears due to stories like this.
@_date: 2019-05-23 11:38:54
How can he be Satoshi if I am?
