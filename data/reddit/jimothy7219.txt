Even if there are problems, it's only like you would have wasted $5 on it.  Remember that the possible outcome is $360.  For that, it's a risk I took (and it sure paid out!).  Let me know how it goes for you.

Just try a little bit, it'll be worth it.  I personally guarantee it.  I'm so confident in them, that if you don't receive something from them within a week, I'll personally changetip you what ever you invested (wouldn't could as a loss to me because I already got my fair share from them).

The txid is c55a36cb4b8cbef48cc9827f9f4a8e15671553f0c15e278dbf814adf98051b03.  My payout address was 1GW1WNohAFb8aDALvLxZkg9dFtwDym92co.  I hope that you have as much success as I did.

Or maybe they're doing you a massive service by giving you an opportunity to invest and spread the wealth increase of the bug instead of keeping it all for themselves and causing the bitcoin to crash by exploiting it for themselves only.

I'm curious, did you try it?

With the bitcoin protocol, there is no way that they can just take everything.  They only receive what you send.

It's $3.  I dare you to go try it.  Imagine getting over $200 from that.  Worked for me, why can't it for you.

You little fucker, that's an awesome website.  Go suck a cock, I have $5 of my own anyway.

The easiest way if you want proof is just to look through their transaction history on their website.  It has a complete history of all the transactions they've made as payouts.
@_date: 2015-01-23 06:33:30
They probably just don't want to waste their time with little payouts and transaction fees associated with such.

Yes, but the key of a ponzi scheme is that it's profitable for initial investors.  So go be an initial investor, make 72 times your money, and laugh all the way to the bank!  Let the suckers after you that finance your choices be the ones who pay.

I made it into a mixing service just in case the company was doing anything illicit.  I didn't want to be traced back to the exchange if they were buying drugs with the money, so I can't really give you a txid of the input, I'm sorry.  I mean it makes sense that they have so many bitcoins though, that would be the only way they could pay out, right?
@_date: 2015-01-22 04:18:36
Not what I said.  I'm just saying that on CryptoDouble, a Ponzi scheme that ran away with a shit-tonne of money, I invested 0.1, received a total of 1.6 BTC, and lost 0.02 BTC, walking away with an extra 1.3BTC.  There's an even greater opportunity here...might as well use it, right?
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:17:10
You mean the txid of the payout they gave to me?
@_date: 2015-01-22 01:21:22
No amount of security would make a difference.  I tried them once and they paid me out.  You get 72 times what you send in, so even if you send in next to nothing (I sent in 0.02), you still get back a ton!  All you have to lose is $5 if you do try it, so don't be worried.

I dare you to try it, what's $3.  It made me $200 just like that.  I agree it's a scam...it's a scam through and through.  But just like cryptodouble.com, it actually paid me.  The thing about ponzi schemes is you have to get in early before they run away with your money.
