Hahaha someone is a bit salty eh?
Listen guy, you are trying to be logical with things that are illogical, saying things like run a program for eternity is simply not possible!
Big numbers are reality, and you aren't ever going to crack those big numbers in reality. You will never generate all 2^256 private keys, so you are talking out of your ass. And to state "to NOT think that it will work is imbecility" makes you the imbecile.
@_date: 2016-08-11 02:24:32
well my friend, big numbers must be hard to grasp for you?
@_date: 2016-08-11 06:02:02
the fuck are you smoking dude? Why would that have ANY effect? Next you are gonna tell me you can also win in a casino if you choose different numbers. Eh I tried I should've just left you at big numbers are hard to grasp... as you are still stuck there!
@_date: 2016-08-11 06:07:48
My gut tells me... maybe.

Yep Satoshi method was pretty fucking smart. Like crazy smart. Like what the fuck? How the fuck? Why the fuck? Will we ever find out these answers? No to the fuck.
Imagine if he wasn't anonymous? Masses would be like "eh I will just start my own internet currency and print money too! hewhewhewhew!"

Lol what are you talking about? Speculate what? Money was taken, they are a key security player, they failed their job to setup proper alerting or failsafes to ensure security.

Hahaha poor Mr. Hearn. It must suck to be so wrong at something you study so hard
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:49:25
Well, that is because they are incompetent and did not setup any type of alerting or failsafe to stop the huge outflow.

u/nullc has much better shit to do than respond and read stuff like this! I will take up his mantle!
Bitcoin can't be fucked with by anybody. There is no algo change required. If they start fucking with BTC, the many other cryptos will take their place if its too much fucking. The tech of Crypto is unleashed on the population and they will soon find a safe place to store value for the first time in the history of mankind. No bank middlemen, no gov middlemen, no middlemen.
Control private keys of population? Thats a dream. Users will never make the same mistake again in China of leaving money on exchanges! Even if they ban all of crypto from china, somewhere else in the world they will be able to find someone to sell to. It can't be stopped.
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:42:12
They are incredibly competent. Don't brush them off or anyone off so easily or you might lose some nice chance at knowledge!
Nothing is an impossible technology come on man people have been saying that for years and years and now we have fucking drones and star wars shit. And fucking Bitcoin!
Core has held strong through so much bullshit. By this point they are at wits end, and finally I guess realize its politics. Politics stops everyone in the real world, but they usually don't realize that is stopping them. These guys need to compromise. They have the tech skills, but they don't have the political skills/negotiating that this global currency apparently needs.

Think beyond that man. We are about to enter the age of automation. Bitcoin will be a way for people to gain wealth if they desire it through deflation. Its hit us at a perfect time I think for the changes that are coming with Automation/Machine Learning
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:26:38
So looks like these guys accept Bitcoin! Hooray little guys doing research on incredibly important drugs to help people! They are a little low on BTC at the moment... 
So give them more if u are feeling nice! This is the kind of stuff Bitcoin was made for. It is free from interference from outsiders, and can fund necessary research for the glory of mankind. And we can see our donations working! So cool. Thank you so much Satoshi! We need this research to help society more than ever. Its so incredible we have the ability now to do this.
@_date: 2017-02-15 21:21:31
It already has reshaped mankind for the better. Look around you. Look at your phone :). We are just getting started... @_date: 2017-02-17 09:53:02
It is how you visit God. He thought you should know. Only the good and faithful are invited.
He doesn't wish many visitors. Only those who have been lied to their whole lives and are lost in this dystopia he did not wish to be. The ego was given to us as a gift to enjoy. It is being controlled and abused now, and God is not pleased.
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:38:29
The whole fucking world is rooted in politics. Change is stopped or made more difficult or downright wrong because of politics. Anyone could have told you this was rooted in politics, but I am glad Peter Todd spoke up. Thank you!
I truly believe that Bitcoin needs to keep blocksize small in order to ensure that it scales properly across many different devices. I understand that Segwit is the SMART solution for some immediate scaling (or was supposed to be pretty immediate!). We need to get it implemented. Right now politics is stopping us? How do you win Politics? You compromise with the dumbasses.
Please, BTC Core dev's, just compromise. Give them a slight blocksize increase WITH segwit, and then we don't have to worry about DYNAMIC blocksize from BTC Unlimited which is the worst thing imaginable. Please compromise! For the glory of Satoshi! Our true goal is to crush bankers, never forget.

@_date: 2017-02-15 05:43:34
You have to compromise in the real world man. This is an easy one.
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:59:20
Thanks man. It really matters to let people know what you think! Segwit is indeed excellent tech and an obvious change and path forward. I would be for Segwit/Slightly bigger blocks just to get this shit DONE and not have to worry about some crazy solution like dynamic block scaling.
Being opposing in the "past" and ready to compromise/work together to move forward in the "now" is awesome. Thanks man! If every person did that, how far would we be?

1000 Bitcoins is enough for them to live comfortably the rest of their life with USD right now. Literally dr evil sounding 1 million dollars. Very cool for them, and we should alll thank them for being there in a time when there was so much doubt and uncertainty for bitcoin in 2010. I am sure they have more, and now they can treat the rest as a investment.
@_date: 2016-12-30 08:05:18
People have to live in the real world. They have enough USD to live in the real world now. They earned 1 MILLION DOLLARS for their hard founding father work. The rest of their coins will be investment in Bitcoin... just as they have done for years.

Fiat Funbucks are NEVER going away buddy. Why would you think they are? I mean I am a BTC holder and I also participate in the funbucks scam, as I get up to 3% cashback simply for swiping a credit card instead of using my BTC.
@_date: 2016-10-07 04:06:36
Well you could pit one organization against each other then. If Microsoft skynet decides to attack Bitcoin, AWS skynet becomes Bitcoin ally and such. Bitcoin is an agent of capitalism, competition will keep it safe as well. Plenty of bitcoin businesses are growing and would not like it if their currency is attacked.

Satoshi referred to miners as nodes in the beginning, because that was the original intention. In this context he means miners I think.
And so the transacation fees should compensate the miners, seperately, when the total coins created hits the pre-determined ceiling(the blocks being capped seems like a pretty good limit). Bam blocksize limit solved by satoshi
@_date: 2016-10-11 06:25:56
Why not?

Yep I believe everything this man just said. Anyone who says "tort" is definitely good enough to be my lawyer.
So alright, ToS do not allow Bitfinex to break the law, aka steal from customers. 
But- customers broke the law. Double Jeopardy, Trebek.

Fiat will always exist as government prints money and we pay money to settle debts with government(taxes etc).
Bitcoin will exist side by side with Fiat. It wasn't created as an experiment in anarchism, it was created as a way to hedge Banks and Government from getting too crazy with their printing presses.
@_date: 2016-10-07 04:08:08
It really isn't possible. Cryptocurrency is like pandoras box, and it wouldn't take much to ensure bitcoin's survival. The more entrenched it becomes the more likely the companies that use bitcoin itself would be enough to defend bitcoin against any attack, rather then having to resort to more dire measures.

Couldn't you use the existing OP_CODE's and do this anyway?

One funny thing is fractional reserve banking that is probably the main problem of banks, is accessible to anyone now rather than just banks. Crypto franctional reserve banking.

They will waste a ton of money, and the press would be hilarious. Game theory my man! Why would they attack when there is nothing to be gained? Although they really, really want to attack and kick some ass, they are powerless. Cryptocurrency can't be put away. If they attack it and really go hard, it can be forked to add features to stop them, another coin can be used... lots of things make it so there really is no way to permanently KILL the idea of encryption based digital money with a blockchain.
 but the blockchain and such will not be stopped from doing what it do. Process digital currency.
Also I don't have a stand as well, I am just very smart
@_date: 2016-10-11 04:07:15
Thanks for the suggestion. Looking at it.. no wal-mart that would've been good. Definitely some ways to save money with BTC on there though for some sites. 3% cash back is for gas, 2% for grocerys, 1% everything else with BoA. 
Amazon is on ur site... but amazon prime card gives fucking 5% cash back no effort required lol. or 0% interest (best thing to do of course if you know how to manage money) with large purchases...
@_date: 2016-10-07 06:29:07
Gotta think of it like thermonuclear war. Cryptocurrency has been unlocked, and you can't put it away, you have to deal with it. Just like war was forever changed by nukes, cryptocurrency has forever changed money. If you attack bitcoin, there are countless other cryptocurrencys ready to take their place. Bitcoin is hard to attack anyway, and getting harder. Companys make money because of bitcoin, and these companys wouldn't sit by while it is destroyed they would take action. Not to mention some of us not so lazy users.
Game theory, really. It is not possible to stop it though and hopefully I have convinced you :). 
@_date: 2016-10-04 04:13:57
So it was implemented? As far as I can tell fees are arbitrary to blocks even though miners get paid them regardless. Why not use those fees?  Nodes will eventually be compensated by transaction fees alone when the total coins created hits the pre-determined ceiling. -Satoshi Motherfucker nakamoto
@_date: 2016-10-14 21:28:08
??? are you fucking kidding or just stupid? If the system was coded to let them know you can't make two transactions for one withdrawal, I would be right according to you? Fuck off moron. You are a waste of my time to try to inform.
@_date: 2016-10-14 10:42:19
author doesn't get that the other coins that are doing really good are serving a purpose. Bitcoin is great it is also serving a purpose. It is WAY more trustworthy and stable just because of its lack of rushing changes, which OTHER FUCKING COINS DO.
The author does not look from the dev perspective, he looks from the waaahhh bitcoin hasn't taken off because other coins have stolen our glory. When in fact other coins are just beta testing for Bitcoin. Gotta look very long term with these things.
Litecoin for example really is a great backup to have for bitcoin, and apparently is popular in china. Local coins can serve a purpose like that. 
Eth has a billion dollar fucking market cap, clearly there is demand for whatever it offers. 
Monero is an excellent example of how privacy can be implemented, and they have done so making the bitcoin dev's look sluggish as hell. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 10:48:25
Well remember awhile back reading about how coinbase somehow managed to make two transactions per withdrawal. That would be SPAM, or misuse probably. They should have to pay for being idiots, or they will continue to waste even more processing power. Its funny there has to be some limit where people dont just throw money away, because of fucking idiot companys like coinbase.

You must not understand how systems work. Its designed to scale so that fucking idiots like yourself cant spam the fuck out of the blockchain for free. Among many other things. In satoshi we trust

Bitcoin has nothing to do with anarchism though. 
Its not anarchy to want control of your money, and bitcoin is simply a way to give control back to people. Not a ton of control, but hedgelike control where there can be more balance. If banks/gov really fuck things up, bitcoin will take off. If they don't, bitcoin will still slowly take off.
Nothing to do with anarchy in the UK
@_date: 2016-10-04 06:44:18
Yea I guess it was!
I was thinking he's talking about the block size limit... not the blocks being mined. I guess its baked in.. I think for scaling it would make sense to separate the 2. When Transactions are a certain limit people should be able to pay to be included anyway, AND not through cutting someone else out.
