I presume it has to do with the [profitability of mining Dogecoin compared to other scrypts]( coins right now. Isn't the reward halving soon. I presume this will change real soon.

Awesome...hopefully the market recovers a bit before this goes live.

What has Dogecoin developed that is innovative? Marketing is one but what other tangible developments has this brought?

Dogecoin did not create the saying "to the moon"

I completely agree and I follow other cryptos daily. There's no need to hate on @_date: 2014-01-24 18:18:14
Use either Vault Of Satoshi, CaVirtex or localbitcoin.   
Protip: if you send coins to your exchange send a small amount to make sure you didn't mess up the address and lose all your coins.

CaVirtex closed down so don't use them.

Good point. If someone creates a coin to abuse the system and market the hell out of it. That might cause some issues if people adopt it. Say Amazon or Visa make a coin then they only accept that coin it could force people to adopt but it could also backfire and  kill their market.

I saw something about escrow services. Looks like that's the safe way of doing it.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:55:34
Gotcha. I suppose I will stick to exchanges then. It seems I would be better off selling using localbitcoins than buying since I am not concerned with the steps it takes to use a exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:43:19
I do not see a threat of having more than one crypto currency. The masses will choose the most popular and the others will be used by less people. If one becomes a better choice then people will switch over. In 5yrs Bitcoin might be obsolete and since there will be competition people will just switch over. No big deal. I don't like IPhones anymore so I'm switching to Android... Zero disruption since they have a user base already.
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:06:52
How did you switch from Bitcoin-qt to multibit? Do you just get a new address and send bitcoins over or can you load the Bitcoin-qt dat file into multibit ?
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:52:50
Hey thanks. I was originally thinking this would be the same or lower prices since sellers would be miners or people that hold bitcoin that made profits but if they are just people who buy from exchanges for you what you said make sense. The higher prices are for anonymity and convenience. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:32:56
The recent Fork had no affect on Litecoin or PPcoin. I cannot see them being affected at the same time unless it was either a another exchange hack or a flaw in Bitcoin but this would not affect PPCoin only Litecoin or similar. A bubble burst might make it more volatile but there is a chance that other Cryptocurrency might be more viable during that time. My 2 bit cents 
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:40:10
If you can afford to lose it go for it. I would also suggest to diversify a tiny bit... So your eggs are not in one crypto basket. Take a small percentage and put it in litecoin or similar. If the bubble actually does burst I can see people jumping to the next crypto currency instead of cashing out to Fiat. But also do not listen to me this is just a guess.
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:24:16
I am only referring to BTC/LTC the value of LTC/USD will go down with BTC since you can only transfer to USD through BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:36:55
Another solution instead of trying to cash out is to convert to another cryptocurrency that is unaffected. Litecoin, PPCoin seem to be the next in line at the moment. Of course if they are affected then we are all screwed.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:01:18
How does this work? I find this very risky even though it can be completely legit. Is it just blind faith that you wont get ripped off?

Downgrade to paper and pen. Hide paper in mattress.
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:11:50
I was originally concerned about all the fees to buy coins on the exchanges but they don't seem so bad now. 
  
Yeah there is a bit of a wait for wire transfers.  CaVirtex do not seem to accept wire transfers anymore so I was looking for a better method, but it appears there 3rd party money service is the best way.
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:04:40
What do you people want to focus on for the video? What are the important key points? 
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:13:39
See litecoin or PPCoin. I think it will only strengthen the crypto currency market. At the very least it will allow people to diversify while the market price fluctuates until it stabilizes. 
@_date: 2013-02-25 04:45:17
Yup, I just gambled .01 and won .02.... Now I just need a BTC Gumball machine.
@_date: 2013-05-13 23:57:06
Nice points. That's exactly how I see it.  Mainstream speculation fast tracks widespread adoption. The media won't care if nothing happens so it can only spread through social media.
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:08:41
Is it not for profit? You may want to include other Crypto Currencies to stay relevant in 5-10yrs time
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:08:34
I do not blame you. Bitcoin is going to tank huge and will probably take a year for any mainstream investors again. LTC seems to be gaining against BTC right now too...which is a interesting development. 
edit: Not sure why I am getting downvoted. Check the charts for yourself [Litecoin]( and [PPC](

Anyone know if the gift cards work in Canada? 
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:09:19
Not all countries will react the same either. I presume you are talking about the U.S. reaction.   
I would compare crypto currency to peer to peer sharing. The regulations on peer to peer sharing only changed the game. More regulation caused it to become more legit and at same time easier to share files. I.E. ITunes / Netflix / YouTube  and torrents / streaming . If somehow it was declared illegal then someone will invent a better currency that bypasses the regulation or it will just go further underground or both. Even if they did kill it somehow. Something better will take its place. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 02:04:59
So can this be done on other exchanges to see what they norm is or at least show people a better exchange?   
A side note. I do think Mt. GOX for better / worse set back Bitcoins at least a year if not longer. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:47:25
Very good points. I like hearing the two sides of the coin. What do you think of other cryptocurrencies? Do you think another developed coin could deal with the volatile market?
