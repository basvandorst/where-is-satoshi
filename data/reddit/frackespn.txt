I've seen tons of Dogecoin tips on - so I doubt the bots are banned. Even a RIOT employee tips Doge from time to time..

Paypal reliant merchant, Bitcoiner, AND Buttcoiner here. Sorry to butt in but the other guy didn't answer so figured I'd give it a whirl.
* 1) No clue, I live in the US so admittedly this doesn't apply to me and I really don't care.
* 2) Online / global transactions. Paypal sucks
I've been using PayPal since it opened. Hell I remember hearing the same shit about PayPal that people say about Bitcoin [ahh Internet money its a scam blah blah blah]. Not the actual on-point criticisms of Bitcoin but the stupid shit you hear people parrot off some news clip they heard about Mt. Gox or something. I've fallen victim to the account lockup "we're gonna hold onto your $2,500 for the next 6-months then mail you a check" early 2000's PayPal. Matter of fact even that was my fault if I'm being totally honest
PayPal sucks far less now than they used to. They surely aren't the perfect, ideal solution but they are by far the best option out there and it could be (and used to be) far far far worse. The fee structure isn't fantastic, but honestly as a small business owner who just "setup and go" with PayPal.. I'd probably be in a world of trouble without it. PayPal gives normal folks access to an easy way to process online transactions. Realistically, that is an incredibly valuable service. For a 3% fee, I'm OK with it. Coinbase kinda-sorta filled this gap for US Bitcoiners, but IMO they have selectively downgraded their only pluses over PayPal. And the fact that hardly anyone uses Bitcoin makes it an apples:oranges comparison.
What I am not OK with, and this isn't limited to PayPal, is the entire burden of CC fraud being placed on the merchant. PayPal's dispute process is, at best, a sham for actual chargebacks (not their in-house disputes, which are generally more reliable). A chargeback basically hand PayPal $20 for being a hassle to them. I think I've only ever won one chargeback, and that's because it was for such an egregious amount that it was worth my time to actually track the person down IRL, outside of PayPal's dispute system. And this is only really a problem when you're dealing with digital goods, which I just happen to be unlucky enough to be into. Bitcoin could, some day, be useful for that but as is it isn't. I use both, if I had to chose between the two it would be PayPal, hands down, every single time.
Bitcoin is a terrible mess of usability for the average Joe (read: customers). It *crudely* solves the customer fraud issue by allowing the merchants to be king of the castle. That isn't an actual solution, CCs would be the same exact thing without third party intermediaries (something you will see spring up if Bitcoin survives and actually grows into a usable product). It may be *technically* better than getting wrecked by WU fees but from the majority of posts I've seen doing the math on here and it is only ever marginally better, if not entirely equal [or with no local exchange far worse] and those never take into account the learning curve / time investment to learning how to use Bitcoin that uneducated people getting raped by WU can't put into it. Its the same shit argument that people bring up with regards to healthy food vs fast food and wonder why poor people don't just each rice and canned veggies every day of their lives. *But guys, they totally cost the same!!! So just eat healthy and don't get fat!* ..Well, yeah, if you conveniently ignore the fact that McD's takes less than 5 minutes and absolutely 0 effort to get.


You can check for the writeup, but IIRC it is only so cheap because the fees are basically being hidden within the mining rewards. At some point in the forever distant future miners aren't going to secure the network w/o financial incentive. When there is no built-in incentive (block reward), or it isn't big enough to be worth their time, miners will not mine. 
PayPal, lately, has also been hands down **100%** faster at putting money into my bank account than Coinbase. I have no idea what happened but they've done a complete swap with each other in the last month or so. I have not had a single PayPal deposit go beyond 2 days, and Coinbase went from putting money into my account within 2 days to taking no less than the full 4 in their warning message. They've also increased the amount of confirmations they require on deposits (6 is a little silly, waiting an hour for something they used to do instantly is a step backwards). PayPal doesn't make me wait an hour if someone sends me money for it to apply to my account (unless they accidentally eCheck, but that isn't PayPal's fault).
Frankly, Coinbase was the only decent thing about using Bitcoin over PayPal, but since they've downgraded their own service I really don't see the appeal between the two unless you're doing something illegal, arguably unethical, or that otherwise runs afoul of PayPal's clearly stated (even if you prefer not to read them) acceptable use policies. I'm not interested in arguing if buying crack *should* be illegal. Fact is its illegal and so long as it remains so that'll be the only real-world use for Bitcoin that is a **major** step above other options. 
..Mostly, Bitcoin as it stands [its vocal community, especially] will never survive the real world - regulations and all. Its super neato, and I really like it, but I also like Beanie Babies (they're cute) and Pokemon cards (Charizard is the shit).

Because this guy (if it isn't some fake throwaway) already lost everything he had, in no small part because bitcoin is still partially an unstable mess, and now he's diving right back in - while apparently not focusing on what could arguably be considered more important life endeavors. Like not living in his parents basement.
And, because this subreddit is a gigantic echo chamber that screams "TO THE MOON" this poor sucker actually believes his 1 BTC is going to make him rich and fix all his life's problems.
No one outside of degenerate gamblers use the term "back in the game" the way OP did. This place is just a soul sucking vacuum for people who are fucked in the head. Normally is a great laugh factory, but like said - this is just sad/pathetic.

Idk how much of it is "butt-hurt." I'm a pretty active Bitcoiner. I have 1 BTC in "cold storage" and use the rest of my Bitcoin income to pay for webhosting, domain reg, VPN services, etc etc every month and I LOVE Honestly, this subreddit (and the Bitcoin ecosystem itself) has a lot of things that need to be made fun of.

IIRC "pros" base salary is 15k/split, so 30k/yr.. Not too bad.
Popular streamers make oodles of $. Even splitting half with Twitch NB had $1,500/mo just from subscribers.
Pros definitely get the short end of the stick, but you could certainly do worse in life.

Because most people are here to speculate on a 1/1,000,000 shot at getting rich. OP loading his coins into a paper wallet and forgetting about them (ie, taking them out of circulation) makes their coins worth more.
I'm with you, I keep what small amount of BTC I have in the Bitcoin-QT wallet and let it be. But then again if some malware did come through and sweep them away I wouldn't bat an eye at it being gone. Obviously not suitable advice if you're dumping your life savings into this.

As much as I don't enjoy the "bring down banking" sort of stories, I have to ask - do you *really* think Spanish banks wont find a way to make that $ back off their customers?
@_date: 2014-07-21 20:56:30
I find nothing about this funny. Also, I literally am an "average Joe bitcoiner" if you've perused my postings. [If this post is even relatively accurate]( then I hold more BTC than something like 60% of people "active" in bitcoin, I run a business that actively transacts in bitcoin (3 regulars generally pay me in BTC, its how I originally learned about crypto to begin with, and I pay my webhosting/domain registration with BTC).
I simply don't subscribe to the crazy ass libertarian bullshit, so I find more fun to read than I'm just a normal guy who falls on the "tech-savvy" side of things so I think bitcoin is cool/neato. I would never fuck myself by going "all-in" on some nascent technology with more problems than a slice of Swiss has holes like far too many people here are doing. Investing in bitcoin is fine if you believe in it, investing in bitcoin when you're living in your parents basement is fucked up.
But you keep that tin-foil hat on strong brother. Don't let the tiny green men get you.

Go Tigers! Of all the places to see Clemson mentioned on reddit, has to be one of the more surprising places.
Still, makes far more sense for GT to get involved before Clemson.. Even with the engineering program Clemson has always been an "ag first" school.

Seriously, where is this still an acceptable thing to do when first meeting someone other than a 1940's fedora fantasy?

Just in case anyone has been lucky enough to avoid reading that story.

I just registered this account to reply, my main account is shadow-banned for inadvertently dox'ing some Dogecoiner so I may be the worst person to send out for a tip bot campaign lol.
I can, however, look up the original Rioter I remember seeing tip Doge, maybe you can FWD the coins to him? I'm not 100% sure how to deny this tip, strangely enough there's no documentation on that from the quick changetip wiki link in the PM.. All due respect if this is your brain child, but mohland's dogecoin bot (last I used it) is infinitely more seamless and easy to use. There seems to be enough documentation to figure out how to send a tip, but receiving/declining is pretty off-putting and I know what BTC/tipping is. If I didn't and someone asked me to connect my reddit account for this I'd nope the heck on out of that. Seriously no disrespect intended. I've just noticed you really trying to push the tipping of BTC, which is awesome, but yeesh - connecting reddit account for a newbie is a lot to ask.
Anyway, hope links can be mildly helpful since otherwise I'm useless lol:
