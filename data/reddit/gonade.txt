"future behavior of the price of an asset will be similar to its past behavior"
this is not a good assumption in crypto land

Wasn't bitcoin at $10 last week?
Be patient

But realize that as soon as you start pledging to print unlimited currency to buy BTC it rapidly becomes unlikely for anyone to take the other side of that trade

This is a cool idea, and could even be used to set up automated "bitcoin stores" by just plopping down a wifi-network.

Wouldn't work because the exchange would simply "run out" of BTC if the price were not allowed to rise. Then people would be forced to mine or trade to acquire BTC.
The only way to peg to the BTC (long term) would be to adjust the CNY money supply, but there would be no way to match the wild price swings of BTC right now.
@_date: 2013-08-05 22:21:56
My point is that if someone uses your bitcoins to go short, there is no guarantee of ever getting them back.
Basically, unenforceable contracts are not worth the paper they're printed on, and this includes most, if not all, bitcoin-related securities.

IMO getting 36% interest on your shorted bitcoins is not even remotely worth the counter-party risk. Does bitfinex check for credit ratings or collateral, or even legitimate identification before allowing people to go short on incredibly volatile assets?

There can be fluctuations, but basically the ETF buys bitcoins when its share price &gt; bitcoin price and sells bitcoins when its share price &lt; bitcoin price. The market takes care of the rest.
The shares should be convertible to bitcoin in some way, similar to the SPDR gold etf

If inflation rises above your debt interest rate it becomes irrational to pay those debts because they are decreasing in size compared to your future earnings

They're exactly the same. For example an S&amp;P 500 ETF like the SPY will simply buy equal amounts of all 500 companies in the index when the ETF price goes over the index price, and will sell all 500 stocks equally when the ETF price is under the index.
