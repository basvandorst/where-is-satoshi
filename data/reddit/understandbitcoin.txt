No :( it'd be nice if you guys could check it out, but old fashioned customer rapport over the years keeps the business going.

Couple hundred for an Amathyst Cathedral (the tall completed ones), or $100-200 for a slab (lying face up on the table)

Hey - she loves Bitcoin ever since I told her about it! We both grew up frustrated with predatory fees. 
The business is her family business and she's on track to take it over as they retire. They attend a few shows a year, and going forward they'll be accepting Bitcoin at all of them. Lookout for a post from me on May 1 from North Carolina!!
Do you live in Florida full time?

QuickBT.com in Canada does this. You buy Bitcoin to your own address. All dollars sent to QuickBT are converted and sent as Bitcoin immediately.
SpendBT.com does the reverse, all Bitcoin sent is immediately converted and sent to the Visa card as dollars.
Many exchanges support two types of customers: retail and traders. Traders need to keep Bitcoin (and private keys) on the exchange to trade. Retail customers really don't. Not sure why more exchanges don't segregate to the two.

It is pretty liberating eh!

No problem - it's a cool idea nonetheless. When the payout half works seamless make sure to let everyone know.
I actually imagine GitHub implementing this right onto their site, "Donate to project" which auto divides to those who provided a btc address.

Hey man - thanks!!
Bought the domain a while ago and actually only recently found a good enough intro that I wanted to put on it.
Are you looking at the section on "the three main ways people get Bitcoins" with the bulleted list? I've now changed that to be "two main ways", since I agree mining definitely should not be a main way anymore.
I do like the next section on creating new bitcoin and mining - and how it ends quite negatively to discourage people from trying.
If you ever see a better intro to Bitcoin that covers off all these topics in one or two pages, definitely send it my way!
I'll see you around the subreddits,

Most importantly, firms will have to buy them if they see their own company listed (to patch bug). This increases the cost of negligence and in the long term means more secure systems.

Nice! We re-posted it on our homepage as our new favorite Bitcoin summary -

Sweet! Can a dev who's made contributions confirm this is working for them?
