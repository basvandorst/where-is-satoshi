Sold at 11120. I’ll advise when i get a position again.

More profitable still to sell and then buy once the dip has bottomed out.

Not at all. But I’ve been to couple of conventions and talked to people who have invested - based on my anecdotal evidence, a lot of the participants are people who know nothing about blockchain and have invested because “it grows in price” which is kinda alarming as most of those people are investing based on the greater fool fallacy. Add to the fact that in my home country, Estonia, all the newspapers have covered Bitcoin extensively, it seems like super mainstream to me.

Except we live in the universe where retirees, policemen, teachers, janitors and just the general public are also considered smart money?

I think that gold as an asset class is a mainstream form of investment. And Bitcoin as an asset class is at a stage where most participants are investing based on the greater fool fallacy rather than because they understand and/or believe in blockchain.

Still way too much when SEPA transfers are either free or 0.2 EUR for example.

Less than 1% of people own gold as an asset also.

Yes, 10k btc

That's what they said last year. Truth is, it might as well be 0.001, really no way to tell. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:46:15
It will be 3000 before it comes up again is my prediction
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:54:28
But selling now at 3600 and buying at the bottom is far better than just holding.

Thanks for explaining. Can you also explain how the transaction counts will rise if the value of BTC also rises. I mean, if Bitcoin value rises, then it will be less used as a currency because people want to hold. Overall, I think that's the main problem with limited issue cryptocurrencies in general - the main point of a currency is that it loses value due to inflation, therefore people have to invest and spend it, in turn making the economy function.

If by enslaved you mean living a better and longer life than at any point in history then yeah, I'm okay with the way things are.

What happens if everything is mined?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:26:32
If you believe in the technology, you should be in some other coin. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:37:31
Still seems pretty good. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:30:10
But why hold if you can sell and open position again once it has dropped? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:45:44
Buying bitcoin should mean that losing money is impossible as you don’t intend to convert back. If you buy bitcoin with a plan to exit later and convert back to fiat, you trade based on the greater fool fallacy. Most participants buy bitcoin to “earn” money with a plan to exit at some point. This shouldnt be the case as it will not allow crypto to succeed. I do not hold a position because of it, thankfully i exited at 11400.

If it's for "storing value" then the volatility in relation to fiat money makes it almost unusable for this purpose. You want to store value, then you store it with something that is very stable. 
Also, the best way existing of storing value doesn't mean that it will always be so. So investing my fiat money (which again, I can actually use every day to live my life with) on something that might be obsolete in 10 years just to "get as many bitcoin as needed" is a bit risky, especially if you believe that you can store value in BTC - if nobody else shares the belief, the value you hold is 0.

Why though? It's just a random thing to have faith in. You could say the same thing about money - you concern is to have as much money as possible. I choose fiat over crypto when the chips are down so obviously i'm concerned about btc value.

Buying before something (stock/asset/currency etc) dips more is just not reasonable if you expect it to dip. Why not buy at your expected bottom?
