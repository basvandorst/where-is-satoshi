You know we've made it now.

Reddit should not be a place where we openly encourage people to break the law......no matter how much we would like for Bitcoin to succeed.

For starters, it is illegal.

I would guess that they are not pushing Bitcoin because Peter Sunde has founded [Flattr](
Flattr needs Paypal for it's customers to get "credit" into Flattr accounts, and to withdraw it's flattr revenue into a fiat currency.
This is taken from the Flattr FAQ:




and this




Essentially, they don't want to piss of Paypal.
They may be "pirates" and anti-establishment on the surface, but they're not stupid, when it comes to doing business.
The reality is that Paypal is still the goliath in Internet payments and these guys know it.

Should have done it in $2500 increments at various times so as not to raise any alarms.

I wrote a similar comment in another thread, but I think it also applies here.

I'm guessing that they don't want to engage in bitcoins, because they do not want to piss of Paypal or the credit card processors that they use.  This is obviously a calculated strategy because it goes against all of the pro-piracy, anonymous, p2p, affordable content, pro-freedom of the Internet, etc. ideology that you might expect from these guys.
Flattr is an interesting project.  It is almost identical in concept to the way that bitcoin tipping on reddit takes place.

In some countries this is already (has been) the case.  
In Hong Kong, for example, when you go to pay and pull out a card, they tell you that it will be an additional 3%, or you can pay with EPS (similar to the way debit cards work) or go to an ATM.
It doesn't seem to deter that many people.

What is Electrum?

Thanks for responding.
The fact that you used the phrase "retarded" against a canvas of other intelligent phrases and language detracts slightly from your narrative.

Pretty much everything in that article sounds like it was targeted at Bitcoin.
Replace Liberty Reserve with (Bitcoin Exchange).
If there is going to be a US government war on Bitcoin, this is how it will happen.

If you look at the wording on the New York Times article, it mentions alot of buzzwords which are related to Bitcoin.
I believe this is a pre-cursor to how they will go after Bitcoin.
They will make it as difficult as possible to exchange Bitcoins to try and prevent people from trading in it.
They will go after all of the exchanges.

Wow, [Noisebridge]( looks awesome.  I wish there was something like that in my city.

I have always wondered why every International news channel shows sporting highlights. Is this related to the reason?
