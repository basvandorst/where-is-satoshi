I can't sell until 16.5K. That's the only way I'll truly make a profit.

I mostly agree with this. The only altcoin I see surviving this tactic is etherium.

I'm more of an ETH fan any way. In USD, my ETH wallet is worth double my bc BTC wallet. Probably the wrong sub to say this in, but I have more faith "hodling" ETH than I do BTC.

BofA customer here. Zero problems. Credit Unions seem to be the ones that don't want anything to do with it.

I was using my credit union starting in August last year. They stopped allowing crypto purchases on September 1st, but I went unnoticed until late November. And that's only because I called asking why my card wouldn't register. Since they werent aware of it, they tokd me I had to either stop using my account for these purchases or they would have to close my account. And I basically had to negotiate with them to let my pending purchases go through since I was doing ACH transactions, and some of them would take up to 7 business days to go through. So they allowed them to go through since I was never made aware of the policy change, and they would have never known I was doing it unless I had called.

How so?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:25:20
I already have a bank account at BofA and have been using that without any issues.

I've heard of this so many times before, but I cant figure out how to pull up my wallet balances on GDAX that I have on Coinbase. Any help for me on that end?

This makes sense, to an extent. But I don't see how war would lead to a portion of a country to evacuate all of their digital currency into cash. I mean, to an extent I understand. But it's not like they wouldn't be able to access that money in the future either way, whether war is imminent or not.  
By no means am I complaining though. This is all a very good thing for me. After today's little Bitcoin Purge, I think I finally have made a return on my Bitcoin investment. It has been a long while since I've purchased BTC at market value without knowing if it would go up or not, but I did today. Not much. Just $25 and $50 increments here in there. But overall, I probably spent $125 today on BTC. Thankfully, I purchased some of it when it was still in the $10,000 range with my savings account, so that won't post until 5 to 7 days from now. So even though I've already made a decent return on my investment with my current BTC Wallet balance, once those purchases post, I will be doing quite well.  
Considering I have purchased Bitcoin in the past for the sole purpose of spending it within the next hour after buying it, I wish I could actually how much of what's in my wallet right now is money I purchased as an investment and not for buying stuff. I suppose I could go through and add all of the BTC values of my BTC I have bought and subtract all of the BTC I have spent. Now only thing is that I will be left with a BTC value, so knowing how much that was initially would be difficult since it was bought in increments of $25 to $100. Hmmmm. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:35:21
I can afford to lose $100. That's not my concern. I'm more concerned about how much I fucked up on buying BTC that high when I know better. Like, why you being a dumbass sugar_free? That's too high to buy! Yet I did it anyway.

I'm only hodling BTC and ETH. FUCK Litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:05:00
That's awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:33:34
B-b-but it was from a bank transfer purchase, which doesn't deposit until 8 days later into my Coinbase. If the BTC price isn't $17K by then, then I'm losing money big time. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:33:52
It just doesn't seem like it would be as...effective in the long run. I have $40 in it. I'm going to leave that and let it do whatever it wants to do. Ethereum is like a back-up up to BTC, I feel it's safe to put *some* money into. BTC has my heart right now. ETH grew on me a while back, I just never invested since I was so far up BTCs ass. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:27:25
Yes, March. But what the hell happened over the last 48 hours???
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:17:14
I need to find a good segwit friendly market that I can do from mobile. Someone recommended Binance? I currently use Coinbsse. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:48:32
My credit union did this too. Thankfully, they allowed what I had already purchased and had pending on ACH holds to go through, but said that I could not purchase anymore or they would decline the transactions. At least I have another account with a different bank that is okay with it, but since it was a credit union, they must not want to take risks with something so volatile. Big Banks don't give a fuck though. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:02:18
With the price of BTC right now, it's a good idea to buy from pretty much any market. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:02:39
Samesies. And you can set alarms for when it passes/goes below a certain BTC price. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:20:06
I just bought $50 BTC on coinbase and had it two second later. I really need to find a way to store my BTC on a hard drive or USB drive though. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:30:09
Sounds good to me. The closer it gets to $5,500, I'm going to put some money into it. I tried to keep about $500 in my coinbase, and then I just go off of that. I'll just have to see where things go in a week. Shit, maybe things will change for the better tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:26:43
That's basically how I felt about it, so I've been setting alerts on coinbase to let me know when it drops below 6000. No one it drops below 6000, I set an alert for when it drops below 5800. Anytime it's below 5800, I tried to buy a little bit here in there. If it gets close to 5500 however, I try to spend at least $100 on it. But thank you for your input I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:24:57
Do you feel pretty confident that it will go back up in value? I've been trying to read up on what the fork will do to the value of Bitcoin in the long run, and I have honestly found nothing that helps me to understand what it might do in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:28:56
It's not that I'm not comfortable seeing it go down into the red. I expect that when it comes to investment. You win, you lose. It's a part of the game. The reason I made this post was because the fork coming up on the 16th 17th and 18th, unless it was called off and I just didn't see. I don't keep more than $500 in my coinbase account anyway, so losing$50 temporarily is not a problem. My main concern is will it go back up. I would at least like to break even, but wouldn't we all Lol
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:23:53
I don't need anyone to "spoon feed me". I'm asking a genuine question looking for genuine advice on if someone thinks that the price of Bitcoin is going to drop really low, or if it's worth it to buy right now and sit on it. I'm not asking you to tell me how much to buy, went to buy, how to buy, nothing like that. All I'm asking for is a simple 3 sentence answer. I've made plenty of Bitcoin purchases, but with the way the market has been lately, and this Fork coming up, I don't know exactly what to do. The fork is what's throwing me off. Because I have researched exactly what this Fork might do to the price of Bitcoin, and I can't find any solid information to help me understand. Fuck whatever your investment strategy is, I don't care about it. All I asked was if people thought it was worth it to buy Bitcoin right now while the price is low or if they think the price is going to go lower or perhaps go up again in the future after the fork. But thank you for your useless input. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:33:08
While I have everyone here, could anyone explain to me in the layman's terms what the fork is and why it's happening? Just creating a new type of crypto currency to compete with BTC or what?  
And honestly, thank you everybody for explaining these things to me. There was one person who commented who was just trying to be an asshole, but for everybody else, you guys help me out a lot and clarified things for me, for the most part. I appreciate you guys helping out a newbie without treating him like one lol
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:23:44
Wise words. Thank you man.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:25:35
That's actually a great idea. The price fluctuates so much lately on an hour to hour basis that I think I may do the same. I appreciate your input.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:52:24
I will definitely look into that. Thank you. Any other services / programs that do the same thing?
