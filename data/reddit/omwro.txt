he is right. nobody is willing to pay 30 dollar of just fees for a cup of coffee. thats why only big traders are trading and the tiny investers just hodling their money because there is no other way to use it

what are your sources to hold the btc up to date? just curious
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:49:58
you only paid 7 dollar for 0.3 BTC. not bad tho. i have seen more worse fees
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:22:53
miners should understand that with higher fees, therr would be less transactions so less for the miners and...
investors should understand that if you want a growing crypto, you need to help them a bit more. if everybody understands this, the system would be better.

@_date: 2018-02-24 23:01:10
fuck you are smart. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:09:49
on which free platforms can you hold your key except the paperwallet? i know that paperwallet is great but you cant send a small amount from your paperwallet to another address.

@_date: 2017-09-14 14:12:55
i started the first week with only 10 dollar and round mid August bought a lot but 2 days later came the hard fork of bcc and it kinda f*cked me up
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:09:25
but it get still manipulated by the bigger guys out there that own more. they sell a big amount and choose to f*ck it for everybody up
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:34:19
there are web based wallets where you can use a pubkey only once, for example blockchain.info wallet. if it get leaked. send money to it once and cant send a 2nd transaction and the bitcoin will dissapear in the space and will be remembered as spacecoin because nobody can use it
