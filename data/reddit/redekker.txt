Once adopted, you think discussion of BIP101 will be allowed here? Or will it be considered "altcoin" discussion?

Destroy? No.
Profit from imposed shortcomings? Seems that way.

My question would be why would you keep BTC at Mt.GOX at all? Copy them in two SD cards, one deposited in a vault at your local bank, the other encrypted on your keychain.

Where do I begin?
I have a Spanish debit card and I definitely want to buy and immediately store my bitcoins in "the real world" (pendrive in my bank, basically). Is that even possible?
I live in the US and I have a bank account in Spain with some beer money that I don't know what to do with it. Is this even legal? How would I declare it in my 2014 tax returns?

Well, females can become sterile if untreated, and the problem is that it does not show symptoms in most males (some develop a bit of burn sensation when peeing).

I'm just here to add freedom of expression in that list. God I do love drawing some Mohammeds.

No, no; don't get me wrong: I don't have a case against contracts. I'm excited for them. But as far as I understand it, decentralized contracts is just a fancy word for putting computers in front of lawyers.
I'm not a smart man, I can't think of a decentralized example that is not more complex than "public event outcome".

Very cool place. I was there in winter (Ice Hotel is the coolest concept ever) and in Summer to see the midnight sun. Got a lot of cool memories from that place. Also, I learned that it is not a good idea to bathe naked in Summer in that area. We got bitten by mosquitos in places no man should ever get bitten at.

I've been to Finland. Twice.
The first time, I was there for four hours, completely hangover (after taking one of the "love boats" or ferries from Stockholm). I saw the two churches, I had a coffee, went back to the ferry to sleep. Can't stay it couldn't have been fabricated to further my sense of Finland existing.
Second time, I went to see Santa Claus in Rovaniemi. To be honest, I took a bus from Luleå and all I saw was fucking snow for hours until we got there. It could've been a re-decorated Kiruna, for all I know. Pretty cool place, and Santa Claus is fucking real. Dude spoke like a bajillion languages (and the fucker knew more Spanish cities' names than I do).
Oh, now that I think about it, we did buy cheap alcohol with Euros in Rovaniemi. Finland totally exists.

Yup. The video where he explains the strength of the math behind Bitcoin is a great watch.

You seem to be passionately for blockchain contracts, so may I ask you how they are enforced? I watched James' video on it, and it just mentions "APIs". Sure, the example he gives (betting on scores or grades) seem simple enough to be able to be implemented and parsed for the contract to be executed.
I'm thinking more of the, let's say, "delivery" scenario. My local post office is run by a bunch of shitheads who swear my package was delivered, but the box never appeared where it was allegedly placed. Their API says "delivered", yet I do not have the goods. By those standards, my Bitcoin is gone, my goods are not in my possesion. Thank goodness for Amazon, who took my word for it and resent the item.
So my worry is that APIs need to be in the hands of third parties, which is basically a digital notary, but in the end there will be an actual human being for the more complex cases, and there will be always the need for lawyers to make sure the notary follows their clients' wishes.
