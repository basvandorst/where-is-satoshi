Why don't you just short sell? Sell even on small jumps in price and buy back more at a lower price.

Its definitely not a currency and that's the point. Fiat currency's are worthless except for their liquidity. Assets are a store of value but aren't liquid. Bitcoin is different because it's a liquid, mobile asset that can be sent anywhere, anytime, by anyone.

Well don't ever sell your whole stack. Sell in 10% increments when you feel like you can buy in lower.

Bitcoin will never scale if it's this fucking hard to understand the technology. I tried explaining a hard fork to my girlfriend and I might as well have been speaking a different language.

You guys don't understand the question. In a traditional stock market, you're buying a share of the company. This share is based on the success of the company as a business. If a startup has a product that has the potential to make a lot of money, it could potentially be a good investment. Bitcoin and Litecoin have a demand because they're intent is as a store of value. 
Since fiat can be printed for free and is constantly devalued, an asset like Bitcoin or lite coin can be a good way to invest your money. Think of it as digital gold. It's security is proven by miners in the form of hashing. This is the only form of inflation since miners are paid for their Computation of the uncrackable cryptography that creates a transaction in the form of the coin.  These other forms of currency aren't a good storage of value and shouldn't be treated as such. They're more of a decentralized form of accounting on the blockchain that supports many different forms of transactions. 
Safe contracts are the main applications of ethereum and Lisk. The value of their tokens should be based on the amount needed to fuel the demand for safe contracts on the platform. But right now they're coin value is based on speculation, not real world usage. This happened in the dot com bubble as well. 90% of these projects will fizzle out and a few will go on to change the world.
