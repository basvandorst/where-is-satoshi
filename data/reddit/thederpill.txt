Thank you for turning this thread around.

Well technically yes, they were ethereum developers prior to the fork, but they could still be coding for the as yet nonexistent fork. 
etc survival was not expected. I understand there is a hashing threshold commitment above which "bitcoin classic" would survive. I presume this is quite a bit lower than 50%? Once this level of pledged hashing power is reached such a split would succeed and "bitcoin classic" survive?
@_date: 2016-08-01 10:05:19
Thanks for your detailed response. Trying to understand here:
So for 2016 blocks after the fork there would be a mess, until difficulty readjusts, but those blocks take much longer due to block time in bitcoin vs eth, so do you think one chain would just stop?
My understanding is that the eth-etc debacle has shown that chain length is irrelevant if two separate chains are created(or at least less relevant than previously thought). As of right now, etc is 4% behind eth in terms of creating new blocks since the hf and still going strong for now.

Why does bitcoin *need* to increase throughput? I sent a friend €20 via bitcoin and it cost a few cent. I sent the same amount through ethereum and it cost a hundredth of a cent. Alts can handle coffee transactions. Bitcoin is immutable store of value.

I have to say I appreciate your argument. Many people quote the processing power of the Bitcoin machine being as powerful as the top 100 supercomputers combined and this is what makes it impenetrable. If mining and running a node becomes out of the reach of even 5% of existing infrastructure, then Bitcoin is technically weaker. How much weaker is still secure enough?.., nobody knows. I would say increase block size enough to not lose a single miner or node (if it were possible to somehow know this in advance!)

I buy a coffee for $2 with n bitcoins.
I now have X-n bitcoins. 
2. I buy n bitcoins from circle for $2 and put it in my bitcoin wallet so I still have X bitcoins. 
Unless you are referring to fees which are similar to using my card to buy the coffee there is no money lost just a minute of my time?

I'm not worried about the scaling side of things. Bitcoins unique selling point as showcased by the timing of its origin is an ultimately non inflatable store of wealth.  Worst case a private organisation will for profit create a centralised trusted cheap payment channel on top of Bitcoin for coffees and crap. Hell it could even be visa or MasterCard people trust them. Best case lightning network or some other solution will do it perfectly and in a decentralised way, but card payments weren't particularly broken. Fiat currencies are.

Easy - use bitwala or similar, verify yourself then send yourself 50k(their max)

Apply for mortgage you can afford with as low and long fixed rate as you can get.
Cash out just enough bitcoins as you need to keep your tax liability low and to pay of your mortgage as slowly as necessary paying quicker only if there is some interest rate shock requiring you to cash out quicker. Goal being not to dip into your bitcoins.

I disagree. Most people get massive loans for their home. So their home ends up being an investment without even realising it. 
Not saying bitcoin should be what they should get massive loans for, but if you are investing there is nothing inherently wrong with taking a loan to do it. Just be aware that you might end up with LESS than zero if you are borrowing just like those homeowners in negative equity.

Bitcoin rises when the financial system seems close to failing. Bailin's (Cyprus) capital controls (greece) hyperinflation (Venezuela). We haven't seen how. Bitcoin. Reacts to bank bailouts. (Other than being created)
Bitcoin rises in financial Armageddon scenarios not just a &lt;10% correction. Wait for next week and be careful shorting.

Felt so much better giving directly to Louis and doing so anonymously at my own price point without him cashing in on my private info on the back end.

If it was Satoshi, 'declare Bitcoin a failed project' sounds like a threat to sell some or all of his coins.

well actually negative interest rates means your savings get diminished just sitting in the bank.  That should also make BTC, and precious metals,  go up in value.

Confusing alright as the Chinese crash caused a BTC spike. But that was much bigger % wise.
Stock market investors are either holding their positions and expecting a rally or selling and waiting to buy stock bargains at the bottom/when things stabilise.
In the sell situation they are not sending their dollars to btc-e for safe keeping in Bitcoin, but that might change if the drop continues.

So it's effectively zero sum, with the balancing tool being the interest rate paid to lenders?  Is this not moot if there is fractional reserve lending going on?
@_date: 2015-04-06 22:15:22
Didn't know it was other users, if that's true that changes things, I'll look into that. 
Maybe I have it wrong, but say I have 1 coin, I lodge it to exchange. I can now go long with 4 coins. 3 on margin. Let's say that's worth 250 dollars each or 1000 dollars. If price goes up to 500, my total balance is 2000, so I close position and my balance is now 1250 after paying back, so a 100% increase in price results in me making 400% profit in fiat. 
My point is : what do exchanges do if, as I suspect, most people on margin are betting this way. Who takes the other side of the bet.  It's not the other users lending, as presumably they want coins back with interest, it's the exchange, right?
In the fiat world this is how there are hundreds of trillions in derivatives, but we can't have trillions, even billions of bitcoin. So if this kind of stuff is fractional reserve, it seems to me in a moon shoot such exchanges have two choices, go bust or try to manipulate price?

I presume he plans on charging a fee so lightning network might limit his capacity to do that. I read it suggested somewhere that bitcoin will have a lot of visa and mastercard layers on it. That makes sense to me as shortest route to scaling, because it doesnt require consensus. He could do this MU2 tomorrow if he wanted. Maybe this will be one such visa of bitcoin and lightning network will be one of may others and they can all compete for the lowest fees and different use cases.
