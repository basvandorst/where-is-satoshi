The app is Facer (basically Netflix of watch faces), and this watch face is Planetary 2.0. Link here: 
Full-disclosure: I'm one of the co-founders of Facer.

Here, just whipped one together in a 2-3 minutes. The complication on the right can be used to track the value of BTC in real time: 
Just need to install this complication:

I'm sure somebody in our community will create it! Or, if you're feeling creative yourself, go for it!

Yep! It's a little finicky because of all the hoops we have to jump through to make the two devices talk, but it works. See info here:

The bitcoin tracker is a complication you can set up on any watch face that supports Android Wear 2.0 complications like the face linked above. 
The specific complication used in the pic is this one:

I agree - I'm not a fan of the way the Apple Watch looks. I think the Android Wear ecosystem brings a lot of diversity to the smartwatch world. The Samsung Gear watches are also very good (I wear the Gear S3 most days)

Facer is basically a platform that hosts thousands of watch faces - the idea is that you can find any watch face that suits your mood/style/needs for the day and just set it up on your watch with one tap. No need to install anything, it's all designed to be as frictionless as possible for the end user, as well as for the designers (we provide design &amp; publishing tools as well). See  for more info!
