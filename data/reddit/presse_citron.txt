I am not the developer of this but:
you see each transaction ("blue block") generated within time interval: Each of them can have (" thin line linking the blocks") a number of Inputs ("green block") and a number of Outputs ("red blocks"). 
Sometimes, a new transaction can use one of this Output, which produces a nice movement of the red block already existing toward the new blue block.

@_date: 2018-09-27 15:56:20


No. the idea was to get rid of what the banks have become and that they return to their normal role: to securely store wealth.
Of course now with bitcoin, you *can* also store your wealth yourself if you want. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 20:42:15
No. The bank can store an encrypted paper wallet, he will never be able to use it. But as said before, it's now an *option*: you can, if you want, store this yourself (it was way more difficult with gold bullion or cash)

Maybe the error was to hide your most valuable items inside a safe.

With Bitcoin, we should not think like we're used to with cash and other barbarous relics.

I've got a proposition :
What about creating an army of low-tech computers like the Raspberry Pi or a little better?
The catch would be that they will be offered for free to any person who will commit himself to "adopt a Raspberry".
To start, we could create a fund to gather enough BTC to offer these Raspberry Pi. One Raspberry pi is below $40. With one BTC we could sponsor already around 16 "little soldiers", 16 persons who could contribute to the network and mine to the good.
Of course you could "cheat" the system by buying the Raspberry offered by the project for your own, but the board would be preconfigured with a P2P mining tool, only one independent shipping address. Of course there will be some people not doing the right thing but for the price of a Raspberry Pi, I don't think it would worth the hassle.
What do you think of this?
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:37:01

This is a superb project! Thanks a lot to the developers.
I've just tried today the alpha-release and I would like to give some ideas about the look and feel: which is already very professional! Good job!
**1.** In each pocket, the use of "stealth address" is not very clear. Same thing for Master address. It would be good to see "infotip" bubble for example for all these different addresses.  
**2.**  On the menu, there is only a "send" option. It would be logical to see something like "Receive".
**3.** "Info Tip" bubbles are missing in pocket &gt; addresses, when we mouse over the different icons, which are sometimes difficult to interpret
**4.** Since the "coinjoin mixing" function is one of the principal asset of DarkWallet, it's a bit strange to s earch inside "advanced" option to enable this feature
**5.** In "latest transactions" in "pocket", the addresses, when too long, overwrite the next column of the time of transactions.
It was a very great job, thanks a lot again for the hard work of the developers! We need so much people like you!

The problem is paying the taxes for the transfer of these BTC to cash or the way these BTC were acquired was not so legal?
For the former, it's "easy": You need to become a tax resident of one of these countries: Germany, Malaysia, Singapore, Portugal, Malta, Belarus, Switzerland ([ 
For the latter, I think it's better to try 4Chan or other.

At least they've collapsed. This zombie company like Bitfinex should have died since but their manipulation (siphoning other accounts, issuing of the pseudo "stable" coins) saved them from bankruptcy.
And a lot of luck because the bear market post-2016 wasn't so profound as the massive crash of 2014 which killed MtGox after their hack.

It's probably due to the massive expansion of stock market:
From October 2016 till January 2018, the S&amp;P500 knew a constant rise for months. Due to massive money printing of course. All this money needed to go somewhere so in addition to stocks, currencies etc... it went to Bitcoin and investors bought massively, largely also thanks to Tether, ~~which eased the process~~  which gives a false feeling of security to big investors.
Then, in January 2018, the madness ended abruptly and the S&amp;P500 fell. Everybody freaked out. Then the central banks went to the rescue, giving a shot to the sick man.  Since then we are experiencing a lot of hiccups in the market. Until the final fall...

I respect the project, it's a fantastic one.
2 drawbacks for me though, which prevent me from using it \(yet\):
\-Necessity to be online all the time. And with the current trade volume on Bisq, you'll have to wait a lot!
\-the limit to 0.25BTC per trade. I know it's to reduce the possibility of fraud but for me, that means also that the system of arbitrator doesn't fulfil its goal.

Okay. So the origin is a malicious server (used to send phishing attack). It seems very stupid for the Electrum devs to have implemented this function: Why would a server send a message to the user??? Bitcoin-core doesn't do it and I don't see the need of it.
Secondly, isn't a server easier to spot (It's not a simple hosted website) and track the fraudster? Even thepiratebay servers failed eventually. Would it be possible to get the position of the server?

A few videos before he claimed that the world couldn't probably sustain more than one cryptocurrency, and now Bitcoin became for him only a part of the myriad of cryptocurrencies. Even if his supporters are mostly interested by Bitcoin (his productions are after all called Bitcoin Q&amp;A, Let's talk Bitcoin). He is still waiting for the next branch to hop upon, modifying his argument little by little. I guess his Ethereum book sales and Ethereum Q&amp;A didn't get as much attention as his Bitcoin production since he didn't take the final step.

In his last [podcast]( with his ETH friends, it was clear for him that BTC is not the future.

He´s got the [Monkey syndrome](  We know he wants to abandon the ship but his major revenues are still from BTC maximalists so...

I share your doubts.
I'd like to add that it seems unreal for me to know so much about the way they were hacked and also so early in the investigation:
" The hackers used a variety of techniques, including phishing, viruses and other attacks. "
and why not drones, secret special agents etc... ?
If you know so much about the hack so early after it's happened (most people in particular never know that they were phished at some point, viruses are engineered to be really difficult to detect), how were you so bad in protecting yourself?
To finish, they already know it's about "hackers". Why not only one hacker? How do they know it isn't only one person who've done that?
It really looks as if they throw this knowledge on people to avoid that one could look for other things (like a critical problem in their infrastructure for example).

If by any chance, the mass decides it prefers to become sheep in the end, so be it, that Bitcoin dies. But when/if the collapse of our current govts happens, BTC should be here to offer its protection. And then, mass adoption will happen, but it will be only a side effect.
