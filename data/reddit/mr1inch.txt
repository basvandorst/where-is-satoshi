Bitonic is really not that great if you think about it. Sure, it's beyond anything currently out there regarding ease of use, but the fees they charge are really high compared to what other exchanges charge. I am still waiting for an exchange which in some way shape or form encourages high frequency trading like OkCoin does, though I doubt we'll see that soon :/

the want the latest news concerning the prices of the auction. We already know every batch went for a price above $665, so now everybody want's to know for how much exactly the BTC was sold.

Tyrion Lannister walked up to me this morning, he confirmed the 2013 release of Half Life 3 and told me that second market bid 665 USD and did not win - as can be seen everywhere on this reddit.

Definitely gonna check this one out. Most apps (like Bitfenix) are just so aesthetically displeasing... I really like how sleek this looks but still gives a lot of information as well.
Thanks for sharing

And bitonic already is way too expensive :/ wish us dutchies had better instant-buy and sell alternatives

Too bad we would have to sell these Bitcoins then in order to give it away to a good cause, and that we would thus flood the market and do more harm than good to the Bitcoin community. Last time I checked WWF can't rescue Panda's with Bitcoins. 
I like the idea of doing this, just don't think it would play out that well.
Also, I'm not too sure if we could raise 1.8 million $ in less than 2 weeks :P

How does it lose ground if it just dips ~$10?
