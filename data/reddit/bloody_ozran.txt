Well you have to remember he is older so technology like blockchain wont be easy for him to get. But he is right so far. Bitcoin and cryptos in general have potential. If it actually reaches any potential past the speculative asset is yet to be seen.

"The landline phone is "the principle instrument" in Buffett's office. "That, and the pile of reading material," he tells CBS.
But you won't find a computer. In fact, Buffett has managed to send just one email his entire life, to Jeff Raikes of Microsoft."
P.S. Tbh, googled it just now. Its a good bet though with people of his age.

Oh god...
He is old means he is not used to that technology as younger people are. Hence him using a fkin landline and sending one e-mail in his life. I kinda envy him tbh with that. :D
Imagine someone talking to you about biomedical or nuclear physics new technology and you trying to judge how it will do in the future. Assuming you are not expert in both, you might have a hard time judging that shit even if someone tells you and you "understand" how it works.

He is not an idiot? Who knew. You should tell CNN so the whole world knows!
Now I'll take a wild guess and say you are not an idiot either. Yet if someone would be talking to you about some technological field you have no clue about or you'd know very little about you might have a bit of a difficulty judging correctly any new development in that field.

Or you could ask Bitcoin ppl why it isnt a bubble. I expect the same result. :D only future will tell.

Well I might have some money coming in the future so basically I'm debating if I should invest in cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and others, or if I should buy a flat and rent it. Flat is a more or less safe investment with good passive income, but there is also fees around it and taxes from rent. Bitcoin on the other hand could be good investment as it will go up, so if I'd resell in the future i might be able to buy more flats. :D
P.S. I have a friend who works in IT and buys bitcoin for some time. So I intend to debate it with him some more in the future.

Yea the other currencies are just an idea, but not sure if its worth the risk. Bitcoin is so known that it would be much harder for it to colapse.
I just thought of a question tho. I know my friend told me there is a limited supply of Bitcoins, i know with mining it grows but as far as I know its getting harder and harder to mine so with limited supply wouldnt it mean that not everyone can have Bitcoin so there is room for other cryptocurrencies to shine?
P.S. Yea I have a ton of research for me to do before I start buying anything. :D

Big thanks for your detailed answer!
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:35:50
Torrents are not currency, bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:27:09
Yea I guess as an asset it would be hard to get rid off.
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:42:07
Yea its about the same chance. :D
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:30:05
Yea I thought so it probably is something like this. Thanks so much for all the explanations Kiero! I'll certainly get some bitcoins in the future, it really seems now like safest investment.

Not in my country. :)

Nice quote, but its not true imo. If the state just makes it illegal, bitcoin might prevail, but you cant do anything with it in your country. And if most countries would agree, rip bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:09:09
I really want to invest in Bitcoin, but how safe it really is long term? Couldnt governments kinda end its use just by a law? How about hackers and safety against hacking?
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:04:20
You'll end up in a rubble.

Every technology can be abused, you are absolutely right. We should think about if this has more benefits than it could have negatives.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:19:56
People who have bitcoin could be doing the same. The more people are buying bitcoin the more theirs bitcoin rises in price.
