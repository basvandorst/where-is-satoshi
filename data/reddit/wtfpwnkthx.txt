Except tulips could not and never have been capable of being used to facilitate party to party transactions globally without a middleman.  Bitcoin goes up for the same reasons any other currency goes up - scarcity, supply, and demand.  Way to understand the technology though.
Will there be another better coin that comes along that can sustain a much higher transaction volume than Bitcoin?  There already are coins like that.  The key is that Bitcoin is well established and has been for years so people know they can place a base level of trust in the technology.  Think of Bitcoin as Myspace back in the day.  It introduced something revolutionary and was the most dominant, trusted social networking site worldwide.  The only reason Facebook took over as king is because Myspace failed to innovate and instead sought revenue at the expense of innovation.  If Bitcoin does not find a specific niche like in large scale global transactions where it's technology is feasible, it will also have to innovate and grow or it will eventually die.  
The three factors mentioned early are what gives Bitcoin value in the first place and worldwide trust in it as an established store of value and as a currency are what cause the massive fluctuations.  If it can overcome the obstacles that reduce trust, it will remain the cryptocurrency standard globally and will continue to increase in value as demand increases.  It is very lilely, though, that another crypto will step in within a few years as the standard once it can prove itself trustworthy as well.  How that will effect Bitcoin will remain to be seen but one thing is certain: Tulips are in no way, shape, or form representative of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.
