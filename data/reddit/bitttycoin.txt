Just playing devils advocate. What if the deposit boxes were full of USD. Then they would be fungible, and be a more fitting analogy. Correct?

Your comment is just awesome.

Is the site he's suggesting even legit?
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:21:53
Yes, there is def. opportunity there, BUT this doesn't work in a Bull market.  By time you buy Bitcoins on Campbx, transfer them to Coinbase, sell those Bitcoins on Coinbase, and wait for the funds to show up in your bank account, it would have been better to just of held onto your bitcoins in the first place.
Again, this all depends on how fast Coinbase takes to deposit fiat into your personal bank account.

A about three months ago, I tried to withdrawal money from MtGox to my US bank account.  After 2 months, MtGox the transfer still hadn't went through.  When I asked about the delay MtGox gave me BS excuses that they had long withdrawal queue ( not the problem of the customer ).  So I ended up cancelling the withdrawal and buying more bitcoins with the money.
My advice, cancel the withdrawal, buy Bitcoins with that money, transfer those bitcoins to another exchange or your local wallet, and then do with them what you please.  If you need fiat cash asap, selling your Bitcoins on localbitcoins.com is probably your best bet.  Coinbase should be relatively quick, compared with MtGox, too.

Yeah, seems to have stabilized again.  But that 20 minute blip is not something that they should overlook. 
We could easily see a large DDOS attack on all the big exchanges.  As a result, crash like the one @ $260.

This really doesn't make any sense.  Bitstamp uses Chase for International Wire transfers.  Either this post is incorrect, or Chase has not fully implemented their ban as of yet.

Sorry, but you guys are a bunch of pussies.  A couple of years ago, back in the day, it was common place for the value of Bitcoin to fluctuate 50% +/- in a given hour.  
Your old cranky Bitcoin Grandfather.

"Virtual currencies in and of themselves are not illegal"

Nope, used it last year.  Then used it again today.

Max Keiser toots his horn way too loud, and coincidentally it gets tooted louder only when Bitcoin is on a bull run.  His prediction is worth as anyone else's, nothing.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:33:31
Exactly, He was placating the journalists.  He should just be blunt about the truth, at least he'll get more respect in the long run. It's much better to have a anonymous currency than to have a currency run by Big Brother. 
An anonymous currency is going to happen whether Joe Blow from Bloomberg or Fox News likes it or not.

It's a good idea, especially since it's low risk, but as soon as CampBX implements ACH, the arbitrage gap will probably close in a hurry.

No. Email support.  They will cancel it.

Not that, but when questions were asked, he rarely seemed eager to answer.  Plus, during q/a he could have refuted some of the other people's answers in a polite way. He was disappointing IMO.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:26:02
Just be careful, b/c when the bubble does pop, it's going to seem like the end of Bitcoin from an emotional standpoint. But in reality, it will just be a small blip in the overall radar.  
For example, the last bubble seemed like the death of Bitcoin, but in reality it was really caused by MtGox getting DDOS'd.  
Lesson: be disciplined and think long term.

PPC is interesting b/c it has built in inflation.

Is there an audio stream of this?  My wifi can't keep up with the video stream.
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:21:18
Ok, then use something different.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:56:07
See, that's where I disagree.  If you politely refute someone, you'll get more respect for what you are fighting for.  Otherwise, the words at these hearings are "full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."  
That's a little harsh, but you get my point
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:26:29
He also didn't stand up to certain untruths being spewed out.  Kinda pussied out at times.
