I should write a short article to give direction to the people that keep asking this question here. Anyway, you need a GPU that is good at mining to have any hope of being profitable. (Google "bitcoin mining hardware comparison" --  you need an AMD card.)
If you pay electricity then I dont really recommend buying a GPU to mine at the moment.
If you cant even find your BTC address then you are not ready to buy equipment for mining :)
I dont know what bitcoin client you are using, but generally you press a "recieve" button or "new address" to get one of your bitcoin receiving addresses.

The seller is taking all the risk when someone buys with Paypal. So the rate should be higher than the market rate.
Everyone is willing to pay $6 via paypal for a bitcoin, because you can instantly sell it above that price on MtGox right now, and there is no risk when buying a bitcoin with paypal. I am certainly willing to pay more than $6 for a bitcoin via paypal right now.
On the other hand, the seller could lose the $6 if you chargeback.

Look, I don't mind if Bitcoin isn't for you.
The problems I have are these:
1. This is a public forum and many people may read what's been said here.
2. You seem to have completely misunderstood a lot of important points made in this thread. I don't mind if your conclusion is that Bitcoin is stupid or bad or whatever you want to think, but I'd like it if you got to that conclusion by examining the facts, instead of just jumping randomly to a conclusion.
- I don't think you've decided much of anything about Bitcoin. What you decided, is that you think that ***mining*** is not for you. Mining is a tiny part of Bitcoin, and I don't really want to have people in the Bitcoin community that are just here to try to make money at mining, and who don't give a shit about Bitcoin's potential to change things for the better. Mining is just something that Bitcoin needs to function, but it is not the purpose of Bitcoin.
- As for this comment thread: If you make $8 per day with 1 computer. How many dollars per day do you make with 100 computers? Mining can be profitable, but mining is almost certainly not for you, because it requires significant resources of many types to scale an operation to that magnitude and remain profitable.
If you want to really see what Bitcoin is about, read about it more.
If you want to join in on the mining, maybe buy a contract from someone who can offer it to you for less than what you can do with your original plan of spending $1000 from scratch at home. Example:

Yes, and again, at any time you can get a new bitcoin address without anyone else knowing that you did so. You are not obligated to register the new address with the government, and they don't know you have it.
So although you are signing transaction receipts with one or more addresses that are registered with the government, there is nothing stopping you from moving money around with your unregistered addresses, and the same goes for everyone else.

&lt;MagicalTux&gt; yep, exactly that
&lt;Blitzboom&gt; the bot creator does that on purpose, yes?
&lt;MagicalTux&gt; Blitzboom: most likely not
&lt;MagicalTux&gt; **his bot simply ran out of funds**, and continued to try to do its stuff with whatever it had remaining
&lt;MagicalTux&gt; because he only had something like 0.002 usd, he couldn't do any "big" trade
&lt;Blitzboom&gt; yeah, but i always thought 0.01 was minimum
&lt;MagicalTux&gt; yep, **the bot was entering larger trades**
&lt;MagicalTux&gt; I'm talking about the account's balance
&lt;MagicalTux&gt; basically the bot was still inputting orders normally, **it just didn't have enough funds to process these**
&lt;Blitzboom&gt; is there no way of making this stuff impossible?
&lt;MagicalTux&gt; **I'll force a minimum fee**
&lt;MagicalTux&gt; it should make the bot run out of funds eventually
&lt;MagicalTux&gt; right now when you trade really small amounts, you may end without a fee

Are you asking if bitcoin *mining* is profitable?
If the price of electricity, equipment, bitcoin, and the network difficulty stayed the same for 2 years, then for some people it is certainly long-run profitable.
I wouldn't really call the research you need to determine this "a study". There are only a few relatively easy to obtain variables here.
Now, taking into account how those variables will change... that's another matter, and guessing whether mining is profitable in the long run is not easy.


Bitcoin is not just about mining. There are many ways to make money using Bitcoin. As many ways as there are to make money with any other currency, or perhaps even more ways. (Sell something for bitcoins, you will make money.)
Bitcoin mining is not Bitcoin.

Be sure to consider your electricity costs, to see if this is worth it for you.
If you use 5xxx cards you can get a ballpark figure for electricity consumption by taking your total MH/s and dividing by 1.9 to get watts.
For example if your rig does 2400 MH/s then your wattage will be roughly 2400/1.9 = 1263 watts.
To find electricity cost, you do:
watts/1000 * price_per_kwh * 24 * 365 = cost of electricity
where price_per_kwh is whatever you pay per KWh on your electricity bill. Take your last electricity bill and divide the cost of the bill by the number of KWhs you used. Do not just trust the rate per KWh that they give you, because there are often other fees like "delivery".
For example if you pay $0.12 per KWh then for this rig you'd be paying $1327 per year in electricity costs.
The cost of a 2400MH/s 5850 based rig is about $1200 if you can find used 5850s.
 
So **to run this rig for one year, you will pay** $1327+$1200 = **$2527**.
Currently at 2400MH/s you will get $7.64 USD per day per GH/s from mining at the current price and difficulty.
And that's if you have 100% uptime, no stales, and no pool fees.
So at 2400 MH/s after one year you will make $2788 ***if price and difficulty stay the same***, which they will not.
In reality, take off 10% for downtime and stales, which leaves you with closer to $2500 per year.
Basically, you will at best break even at the end of 1 year if construct such a rig, and pay an average of $0.12/KWh, and more likely, you will lose money on this.
Another thing to consider is your time, effort, and the fact that you will be able to use almost nothing else on the circuit that your mining rig is plugged into because the max capacity (in north america) for a house plug is about 1400W for constant load. So for any plugs that are on that same circuit, you will have to make sure nothing is plugged into them.
I'm all for trying out mining, I just want you to fully understand what you're getting yourself into :)

A decentralized exchange is one thing, but what you are proposing is a P2P  with trade transactions simplified by an application interface.
The web of trust used at  is actually relatively weak. It's just that the amount of effort needed to break it and take the small amount of money that you could take makes it not worth the effort.
If you brought a lot of money to a web of trust system, and then gave users an interface so that you didn't have to bother with disguising your fake identity, or having an identity on IRC -- the effort would be reduced, and the reward for fraud would be greatly increased.
All you have to do is make 100 accounts, and do a few legitimate transactions, plus a bunch of transactions between your 100 accounts. Each account does 2 transactions with every other account. Now you have 100 accounts with 200 transactions each -- your own personal web of mistrust.
After that point, you can get ready to scam someone as soon as a big enough trade comes along.
I really don't think that we need a slow, defraudable, web of trust mess.
Sorry for the bluntness of my comment.

I feel that using technical analysis alone is not a good strategy for deciding when to buy/sell.
However, there is evidence that technical analysis has some predictive power, due to the emotions of investors (I suppose it is a somewhat self fulfilling prophecy -- other investors "believe" in technical analysis, so it starts to bear some meaning).
Professors, quants and intelligent researchers have taken this seriously (as you can see from the Wikipedia article), so I think it's also somewhat unfair to equate technical analysis directly with something like a horoscope or a psychic reading.

The big risk was the leveraging.
Bitcoinica allows you to trade with up to 10x more money than you have. The downside to this is that if your position loses ~~10%~~ 6% of it's value, they automatically close your position, and you've lost all your money.
Shorting is just when you sell someone elses bitcoins, in order to buy them back later. This allows you to profit from a decrease in bitcoin price.

And the rate of 6 blocks per hour is regulated by changing the difficulty.
If mining profitability drops, then miners turn off their machines, and the difficulty goes down.
If the difficulty drops, then mining profitability increases, because you can find blocks faster.
When you mine, ***you*** do not find 6 blocks per hour (unless you have 100% of the network hash power, which obviously no one does).

I do. I was only responding to your point as you stated it :)
First, our costs are lower than $1500/GH/s.
What if the price rises faster than difficulty?
Note that since FPGAs are currently the best option, but require much larger up front capital than GPUs did in the previous 12 months, it's likely that difficulty will rise slower than it did previously, since it's more difficult to buy new equipment (it costs more) and it's riskier (it costs more).
It also takes a lot longer to get new FPGAs compared with GPUs. Typically you are waiting 6-12 weeks to get FPGAs, which means that it's difficult to respond to big price increases quickly.
It's also likely that at the current price, most of the miners have their equipment turned on already, which means that difficulty will not suddenly rise with a small price increase in the near future.

Well, we know that people buy and sell more at a smaller price range because that's just the definition of increasing volume with increased stability!
However, your original claim is that when people see stability they buy bitcoin, and that buying bitcoin increases stability.
However, buying bitcoin more doesn't increase stability -- buying *at the same price* (or small price range) increases stability. Also, sellers must also be compelled to ask the same price in order for the price to stay stable.
So your original statement that buying bitcoins increases stability, really does not explain why the stability increased.

They are thinking of moving away from berkeley db altogether, instead of trying to optimize for it.

While I hesitate to defend technical analysis in general, I have to point out that you haven't provided any clear evidence that this technical analysis is useless.
The trendlines do not say "THE PRICE WILL GO HERE!", instead they say "well, here is one trend".
[Your argument]( is that we must pick one of the trendlines and hope the price follows it, but that is not how trendlines are typically used.
Consider your own argument. If the price will follow one of those trendlines, and we just pick a random one (uniformly random choice), then **we have a 1/5 chance of picking a trendline where the price goes down, and a 4/5 chance of picking one where the price rises**.
This is because:
You have 5 trendlines on that chart.
4 of those trendlines suggest that the price will rise.
1 of those trendlines suggest that the price will fall.
So we might use trendlines in this way to suggest whether the price has a probability &gt;0.5 of going up (not that the price is going to follow any one of those particular trendlines). If so, then this can guide our decision to buy.
The technical analysis you showed suggests "the price will rise". **That is a falsifiable statement.**
Again, I am not a strong proponent of technical analysis, I just don't agree that your reasoning is sound.
@_date: 2012-03-18 17:38:32
The 51% miner is still mining on top of the network's blocks, not just their own blocks though. So even though they don't include transactions, everything would proceed as normal, except that transactions would take about 10 minutes longer to be processed.

Fair enough. I think that the UI changes were great ones, but even if you dont agree with that, there's always the performance benefit of Win7. If you do some googling about win7 vs XP performance, I think you'll find that windows 7 on new machines will outperform XP in many cases.
As I recall, many people stuck with win 98 over 2k. And most people chose Win XP over any of the previous versions.
I could understand choosing 98 over 2k and I could understand choosing XP over Vista. I guess that I don't understand choosing XP over Win7, as Win7 is a polished release that in my mind seems to improve in every way I can think of. But, maybe there is some legitimate reason to make your choice.
It won't really affect my life if you don't change your mind, but you might want to look into Win7 some more and see if it really makes sense to stick with XP (you can't keep XP forever, you know?). Don't be stubborn and avoid change just for the sake of avoiding change -- win 7 does bring some significant improvements. I can't speak about win8 because I haven't seen it yet.

The concerning part is that based on his screenshots only, it looks like Bitcoinica may have influenced the price. Remember, bitcoinica gets to set the price to whatever they want technically, as they are not a real market.
Notice that I defended the position that bitcoinica did not influence the price in my post when I said "the volume before and after the crash looks balanced to me".
That is why I linked my own chart. Based on the OTHER GUY'S chart, it looks suspicious.
Bitcoinica has huge incentive to buy on MtGox and then raise the bitcoinica price because when bitcoinica operates at zero reserve (which they were), bitcoinica users get confused and panicked, which happened a couple of weeks ago when very few people held short positions, and many held long ones.
At the end of the day, bitcoinica is a bucket shop.
And as a bucket shop, they always have incentive to screw around with the price by either making a purchase on the real market (mtgox) or by setting a different price from the real market themselves.

It's useful to note that bitcoind/bitcoin-qt only generates 100 keys in advance. 
If you backup your wallet first, and then receive bitcoins at more than 100 addresses, then your backup will be out of date.

Removed everything I said because Armory uses a special method of storing a paper wallet, that allows all of your private keys to be generated from the starting point:
This is really cool because it means that ALL of your current and future private keys are backed up by this.
The downside is that you must make sure that you also keep a copy of the Armory code if you want to be certain that you will forever and always be able to restore your wallet from the paper wallet backup.

If they are scared of the internet, then you should not be advertising Bitcoin to them in it's current stage. Bitcoin is currently still in beta, and is not nearly as easy to use as it's going to be when it's developed further.
Showing Bitcoin to people who are driven away by the term "internet cash"/"internet money" are going to be forever turned off when they try to use Bitcoin in a meaningful way.
We're much better off to expand the userbase slowly now, and then reach out to those type of people later, when Bitcoin is **really easy** to use, in a couple of years.

No, since fixed costs and marginal costs must be considered, but you only consider marginal costs.
I.e. **you spend money not only on electricity, but also on the hardware**.
The fixed costs of FPGAs are much higher than the fixed costs of GPUs, but the marginal costs are much lower.
Here is an imaginary example that uses nice round numbers (not too far from the real world).
It costs $700 to buy 1 GH/s with GPUs, and $600 to run the GPUs for 1 year.
It costs $1270 to buy 1 GH/s with FPGAs, and $20 to run the FPGAs for 1 year.
**They both cost $1300 in the first year, but the FPGAs cost 81% more in upfront costs, and 97% less in operating costs**.
Suppose that 1 GH/s of mining generates $1300 per year, then in this example **both the FPGAs and GPUs paid off after 1 year**. Now suppose that new tech (new FPGAs or ASICS) becomes available that makes these old options obsolete due to a difficulty increase. Now you can keep using the FPGAs for say 6 more months before the new difficulty makes them unprofitable, and you can use the GPUs for only 3 more months.
Now we buy new tech, but **we only used a fraction of the cost of electricity with the old FPGAs**.

10 mines on a 25 mine field, which implies 60% chance to win the first click.
On the first click you get 1.54x your money.
So basically on average if you just click once and then cash out then you expect to lose 7.6% of your money per game.
Cool game, but maybe make the odds a little better than that for the player? Casinos have odds that bad for a lot of games, but their operating costs are way higher too, and you get the casino experience. Casinos also have games with better odds than that :/

$120.65/yr USD for the first 100 MH/s 1 year contract. ($92.15/yr for 2 years.)
You can cancel the contract at any time for a fee.
The amount is automatically computed based on 100% uptime.
So there is no variance, no stales, no downtime, etc. In this respect, you really get quite a bit more than 100MH/s worth of mining power.
Since you can buy this with a credit card (paypal), it might also be a good way for new interested Bitcoin users to get some coins and invest into Bitcoin.

Technological change (and the very near movement to FPGAs) is greatly reducing the electrical cost of securing the network.

Yes "the manipulator" might not be a perfect term. He is taking a risk, but he *is*(was) affecting the the price as well -- hence the term.
It is possible that there are multiple people placing these orders -- but it's clear that these $100k+ orders (that sometimes existed for only 30 seconds) are controlled by one person at a time. That is, when we suddenly saw a $100k+ bid wall at $2.30 (where there was maybe $10k at that price seconds ago), it was not an accumulation of many people putting bids in at $100k -- it was much more likely just one person putting in one bid.
But yes, I see your point and have an upvote -- different large orders could be from multiple different people -- I can't prove it one way or the other, only Mt.Gox and the Manipulator(s) know this.
And I hasten to point out again, that I do not think that the price rise has anything much to do with "the manipulator(s)" running out of bitcoins -- especially since they seemed to put much larger bid walls than sell walls when we were seeing that behavior.

Hi. I own ferroh.com, and I'm working hard to bring substantial products to Bitcoin, with the goal of expanding bitcoins use, as I feel that it has a lot of potential to do great stuff.
Your idea has already been proposed in various ways.
If you want to get people to change to using something else, then you need to give them something significantly improved.
Your proposal is essentially email, except you pay for it. And you pay for it (somehow) with Bitcoin.
Google already offers corporate email that you can pay for, and it is incredibly inexpensive and well done.
You haven't clearly stated how Bitcoin will be used for payment, or WHY we really need to start paying for email, when it is already free.
If attachment size is for some reason a problem, then it sounds like you want to create a file sharing service like rapidshare, except paid for with bitcoins (so you just email the link to the file you want to download). That's not a bad idea, but it's also been proposed hundreds of times in this community, and has it's flaws too.
Why would a large attachment replace a parcel or a letter anyway? Gmail's free service attachment limit is 25 MB.


Actually, shooting bad ideas down is a big part of being successful.
So, when you have actually solved a problem, I'll be more than happy to chime in and contribute to, or support your solution.
@_date: 2012-02-12 09:03:21


vbuterin claims that the technical analysis doesn't make a falsifiable claim, because the trendlines drawn predict 5 different paths that the price will take.
However, if you know the probability distribution of each path, then you can know which trend to pick.
So the technical analysis makes a falsifiable claim, because we can compute which trendline has the highest probability of succeeding, and then repeat the same analysis many times and see if it makes predictions with the probability that it claims to.
However, if you don't like that argument because the technical analysis doesn't provide the probability distribution for us, then you have to go read the actual technical analysis (it is not fully contained in the OP image!) to see what method is used to determine the probability distribution. (Or to see how the trendlines are used.)


Okay, it is true that vbuterin did not explicitly state anything about the probability distributions.
However, vbuterin says that you can just "pick any trendline at random", which implied to me that he thought that he was talking about a uniform random distribution -- maybe he wasn't, and I suppose that clouded my argument.
The main point is that the trendlines ARE NOT intended to predict the direction of the price, and instead suggest several possible directions with some certain probability each.
The point I was trying to make was that the technical analysis DOES provide a falsifiable claim. Or at least that most technical analysis in general makes falsifiable claims.
Remember that the OP image (which this thread is about), as well as his comments state that the technical analysis is not making a falsifiable claim because we don't know which trendline will accurately predict the price.
So if the technical analysis makes a falsifiable claim, then vbuterin's argument is not sound.
Does this make sense?

How do you deny that it is an encrypted partition if you just have a file lying around that looks like random data? That is less deniable than using a hidden volume.
If you put the random data in an encrypted drive (which can just be a file), you can hide it so that it is impossible to know if there is such a block of data, hence the deniability.
TLDR: What you suggest reduces deniability.

You can make up your own definitions of words all day if you like, but I think you will profit more if you use the widely accepted definition.
What mpkomara was saying was essentially that Bitcoin mining self adjusts so that it's profitability tends toward zero.


If you think that you are going to buy a few GPUs and pay your rent with mining, then you very much have the wrong idea.
Even if mining is profitable for a few rigs for you, you'll find that you run into trouble when you want to scale beyond how much electricity (and cooling) your house can provide.

I don't know why this is getting so many downvotes and negative comments.
It doesn't matter if you don't get the message. In fact, it doesn't really matter what the message is.
What is important is that:
- The ending is hilarious and dramatic.
- The ending word is "***BITCOIN***", (screamed) in a youtube video with tens of thousands of views.
- It really doesn't say anything specifically bad about Bitcoin. It does however, leave the user with a dramatic image of Bitcoin in his mind after watching!
Most of all, this video is positive for Bitcoin in the following important way:
Tens of thousands of viewers hear the word Bitcoin. It doesn't matter if these viewers look up Bitcoin as a result. It's unlikely that they will think much better or worse of Bitcoin as a result.
When these viewers eventually see/hear about Bitcoin again in the future, these viewers will be more interested with and comfortable with Bitcoin as a result of having heard it at some point in the past. Advertisers know this well, which is why there are so many Coca-cola, Nike, etc. commercials that say absolutely nothing about their product other than showing their logo.

A USB flash drive is going to give you like 2 write ops/sec.
And when it gets close to full you're talking about more like several seconds per write op.
I suggest copy/pasting the wallet.dat every time (make sure client is closed when you do this), and let the blockchain sync on the HDD on that machine.
Or, use a client that doesn't need the chain, like electrum.
You can also try using a USB HDD instead (a small 2.5in laptop drive or SSD). I'm not sure how slow that will be (due to the USB interface), but it should be a lot better than your 2.5MB/s write flash drive.

Hi muyuu;
First, thanks for the criticism, it is always welcome when it is constructive!
That said, I think you've misunderstood what the Ferroh mining contracts do, precisely. This is not a pie in the sky financial instrument.


The point of our contracts is to *reduce* our risk, not increase it. We simply hand over the output of our mining hardware to you. By buying a contract, you have already paid for most or all of our costs. In return, we give you the opportunity for some of our returns, in exchange for reducing our risks.


No, you are guaranteed the maximum theoretical output from the 100MH/s you buy with a contract. We simply deliver mining output according to the formula of the expected number of bitcoins per unit time, at any given difficulty.
You can look at the history of difficulty over the course of your contract at any time and check if we have paid you correctly or not -- you are NOT just trusting us to try to mine well -- ***your mining output is guaranteed*** regardless of the state of our equipment. The probability of us having the amount of downtime required to reduce our profit to zero is small, and we have the capital needed to take losses on this service if we have to.
***We are not just a mining contracts company***, this is just one of many services that are in the works. One of the reasons that we offer these contracts is to generate positive rep with future customers of ***other services*** -- NOT because we are trying to survive on mining contracts alone (though we can't really lose money on mining contracts).


It's actually nothing like that.
We offer no promise of any returns. **Our costs to mine are lower** than a home operation with a few GPUs, **because of the size of our operation** (bulk equipment purchases, operating many machines at once, custom management software). We simply let you rent some of our equipment, and we give you the expected output according to a well known, well understood mathematical formula.
( For example you could use this tool to check that we are using the same formula:
 )


~~This is the exact opposite of reducing our risk, which is one of your main criticisms of our service, isn't it?~~
**Edit:** Upon further reflection I see what you are really suggesting here. This doesn't accomplish what we are trying to do, and doesn't really help anyone except to increase mining power on the network. It also wouldn't require us to mine, and a smart investor would simply buy coins instead.
The reason that our service works is because it is virtually impossible to bankrupt us as a result of buying our contracts -- so you know we will still be here in a year. 


We can't lose big on this operation unless bitcoin value goes to zero tomorrow and then our current mining equipment becomes close to worthless. If we sell enough contracts to rent out all our equipment to clients, then we can't lose anything (except for the profits that we miss out on by doing so). In other words, our risk *decreases* with every contract we sell, until we buy another set of equipment.
For even more, consider my comment here:
Thanks again for the reply!
P.S. I apologize if I put anything indelicately, I am writing this in a bit of a rush :)

Not just that they know their tech, but that anyone manufacturing new chips based on a design that they already have working on old chips, can make a pretty good estimate of how fast things will go on the new ones. (Granted, the ASIC and FPGA designs will differ significantly but the principle remains.)
Their estimates could be off, but I would be very, very surprised if they were off by more than say, 50%.
It would be very damaging to them if they are overestimating by a margin anywhere near that wide too -- given the response they received when their FPGA chip performance was underestimated by about 30%.
I wouldn't be surprised if these ASIC chips actually go ***faster*** than their estimates.
And then there are the engineers in bitcointalk.org that have discussed what ASIC performance would look like over and over, and they unanimously agree that it would be an order of magnitude performance increase over GPUs (and have agreed on this for some time now).
One of those engineers might be better equipped to convince you, since I'm just a software engineer myself.

As I have pointed out already, I can't possibly know the exact rate at which processing power cost vs network size changes.
But, it's clear that processing power can scale more slowly than network size scales.
To add to what Pixelelements said:
We already have the most powerful distributed computer in the world securing the Bitcoin network. If the network multiplied in size by 100, do you really think that we will need 100 times more processing power? Why would we? Even if we did, economy of scale would at the very least reduce the costs to obtain that processing power (e.g. via ASICs and large firms buying power). 
It also helps that firms that specialize in mining will prevent your average user from entering the mining industry, due to the barrier to entry costs, which will keep mining power low -- this is the same way that most industries work.

Which is great news since as I just tried to demonstrate, the cost of processing power increases much more slowly than the size of the network, as Bitcoin scales up.
So at 10000 times the network size, the cost of processing power will only be perhaps 10 times higher -- which is very efficient compared with the current resource usage of the entire banking system.

The numbers I gave in the previous example are very close to the real world numbers.
Actual real world running costs are as follows:
Assume $0.10/KWh.
The current electricity costs of 1GH/s of FPGAs is about $46/year.
The current electricity costs of 1GH/s of 59xx series GPUs is about $438/year.


No, I am saying that when you evaluate the long run profitability of *any* firm, you take into account both marginal and fixed costs. Electricity costs for FPGAs represent only 2% of the total costs of buying and running an FPGA for the equipment we use for this:
So the price has to fall very far (to about $0.17 at the current difficulty), or the difficulty has to rise an enormous amount from the current difficulty and price of $5.50 (difficulty has to rise by a factor of 31x) in order for FPGAs to no longer be profitable to run.
If Bitcoin conditions stay as they are now, then an FPGA pays for itself in less than a year.
If the difficulty multiplies by 5x today, then an FPGA pays for itself in 7.5 years -- assuming no hardware failure.
In 7.5 years, technology changes quite a lot.
***Consider this:***
Assume you won a $1 million lottery. If you could buy an FPGA that does 1 GH/s, and costs ***nothing*** to run (free electricity forever), but it costs $100k to buy the FPGA, would you buy it?
Of course not -- you have to risk that bitcoin will be around for hundreds of years, and that you will live long enough to see a profit. It doesn't doesn't matter that the electricity cost is 0, because the fixed cost of buying the equipment is way too high.


Moores law ensures that electricity consumption of new chips decreases fairly predictably, for a long time anyway.
New FPGA chips are being released in about 1 year using a new fab process, for example.
Used 7xxx series AMD GPUs will be available at a low price in 1 year as well.
So there you go, just some food for thought.

Tens of thousands of diablo 3 accounts have been compromised by trojans since it's release a few weeks ago.
With digital cash, the incentive to install trojans is even higher.
That is not a good solution.

There are millions of infected computers at the moment, so I can't agree with your point at all.
The flashback virus had infected 600000 (***macs*** only) as of a couple of months ago.
Grandma is probably using Windows 7 or OSX on her desktop -- not iOS.
You can easily rent botnets with many tens of thousands of computers from many different vendors and they are ***cheap*** to rent ($200/day for 100k bots) and there are dozens of vendors that can offer 50k+ botnets.
I'm not going to cite sources on that one (because of the nature of the source sites), but you can relatively easily google this.
Edit: I should probably give you some kind of source so [here](


Because the attacker cannot re-use the password for a transaction that sends to an address that the attacker owns -- again, the password is a *one time* password (it is a different password at every use).
- Grandma requests to send coins to anfedorov
- Her computer asks her for a one time password
- She presses an authenticator hardware device (or enters a number from her phone app) which enters the one time password
- The coins are sent to anfederov
If a trojan intercepts the password, it has to request a different transaction, which the program then requires an OTP for, but the program will require a 10 second delay before entering it, since no password was provided for the previous transaction.
This delay causes the currently stolen OTP to expire, and the attacker cannot provide another one for his transaction, because he does not have the OTP device.

It depends what you're measuring. The way I've seen this estimate calculated is by counting the surface area of the beaches on the earth, times the amount of sand you expect to find per unit area of a beach.

**550 days to break even**, assuming you pay $32.5k and it produces exactly 20GH/s with zero downtime, zero stales, and you pay **zero electricity costs**.
In reality, you will probably pay some electricity, and the $2500 shipping could be more. You will also experience stales and very likely some downtime also.
This all assumes that the difficulty and price do not change.
Expect to wait at least 600 days to break even, if price and difficulty do not change from where they currently are.
You can use  to figure this out.
In reality, you don't get to start mining until July, so the returns will probably take even longer than 600 days.\
A 2 year [mining contract]( will be profitable sooner than that using the same method of analysis, btw (and you don't have to spend $3k, wait until July to mine, no downtime, no stales, and you don't have to manage the equipment).

Using the example that I just gave you, at the current valuation ($6) and difficulty, it takes less than one year to pay off the $1500/GH/s FPGA equipment.
Check for yourself here:
1 year at 1GH/s at $6 produces $1682 worth of bitcoins per year.
And again, our costs are lower than the $1500/GH/s example that I gave.


We are doing exactly that, and contracting out a bunch of equipment to get some of that capital back for other uses -- this is how we have contracts at this price. Hopefully this last point has been illuminating? :)

7x$127 = $889.
The card the OP advertises is $495. The cost to run it over 1 year is $306 if it uses 350 watts, and you pay $0.10 per KWh. A total cost for one year of $801.

It is also "standard" for currencies to fluctuate less than 1% per day.
It is also standard to charge 1-3 pips per trade, bitcoinica charges tens to hundreds of times more than this.
Bitcoin does not currently have the same properties as currencies like the USD/CAD/EURO/etc. Bitcoinica can easily wipe out it's traders positions when they trade on 10:1 or even 5:1 margin, since the market depth is often very shallow at MtGox, and virtually no one could know that they were doing this, or stop them.
Bitcoinica is moving their incorporation out of the US in order to comply.
However, the U.S. SEC can and will come after you if you do business with US clients, without complying with US regulations, even if none of your business physically operates in the US. Whether the long arm of the SEC can reach bitcoinica depends upon how the SEC views bitcoin trading. We'll see if they meet U.S. regulations (or stop doing business with US clients) -- I highly doubt it.

@_date: 2012-02-01 22:46:33
What are you basing that on?
Look at this example:
If memory serves, you can get the cost per GH/s down to about $1500 including export taxes if you buy 250 units (about $65000 worth) from zTEX.
The electricity cost to run those is about $60/GH per year, at $0.10 per KWh.
So even with readily available components with no special negotiations, you can already get into the ballpark of the cost of Ferroh mining contracts as long as you are willing to spend about $70k in your first year.
The cost of GPUs is already higher than that after 1 year, if you take into account the cost of storing them (you very quickly run out of plugs in a non commercial space).
Note however, that Ferroh is not using zTEX FPGAs, and our costs are lower than this.


The 5970 in this post uses something like 450 watts per GH/s. A spartan 6 based FPGA uses less than 20 watts per GH/s. A factor of 22x difference. So in 3 years, GPUs will still very likely not beat even spartan 6 FPGAs in terms of GH/watt, especially given that the performance of the already tested smaller die sized 7000 series GPUs (28nm process?) deliver a relatively small GH/watt improvement.
That said, new FPGA chips are on the horizon (available in about 1 year), and those could change things quite a bit, though their initial cost will probably be very high.

However, the current exchange rate is about $5 per bitcoin.

No. You said it would take over 14 days to mine $1.
It will take 0.29 days to mine $1 with a 1GH/s mining machine.
How fast you mine $1 worth of bitcoins depends on how fast your mining machine is.

You can expect Bitcoin mining to always be profitable for someone, as long as Bitcoin has value.
If it becomes unprofitable for everyone, they some people will stop mining, and the mining difficulty will fall until it is profitable for someone again.
If you want proof that it is profitable right now, then use a mining calculator to see how many coins you get per day right now (about 0.67 per day per 1 GH/s), and then consider [hash rates and costs of various hardware]( and consider that electricity is free for many people, and then look at how long it will take to pay off the hardware.
If electricity is not free for you, then take the number of watts consumed by a piece of hardware and multiply it by the cost of electricity that you pay.
I have no way of knowing that mining is profitable ***for you***. How could I know that without knowing how much capital you have to throw at hardware, your electricity costs, and what other types of resources you have access to (mining location, close proximity to FPGA manufacturers, etc.).
I only know that it is profitable for many people.
If you pay more than $0.09/KW/h for electricity, then I don't really recommend it.

At that point the current difficulty will be orders of magnitude higher than it currently is.


It is known that we are relatively close to the theoretical maximum achievable performance on FPGAs, and their performance is well known.
I am not an expert in this field, but my understanding is that knowing the performance limitations of current gen ASICs gets you an estimate within at least an order of magnitude of the maximum achievable performance, and BFLs numbers are still far above what seems possible. 
Especially given that BFL has a very small budget (very small in terms of producing processors). They dont have the many tens of millions required to begin manufacturing chips that are comparable to the manufacturing process used by say, Intel or AMD, for their products.
It doesn't matter if you know their proprietary techniques -- you cannot do a hash with just one transistor no matter what fancy technique you use. There is a theoretical limit on how fast you can go with current gen ASICs.


Or zero for electricity. It has almost no effect. $50 for a year of electricty usage vs getting $700 less than you expected this year because difficulty increased faster than you expected.

When I mention that it's been mentioned in the NY Times, Wired magazine, etc., that helps a lot.

Fractional reserve lending is obviously possible with Bitcoin.
Fractional reserve banking just refers to holding only part of user's accounts in reserve for immediate withdrawal. Actually this is likely already done by sites like MtGox, where many of the coins are held in offline storage -- that is a fractional reserve!
The difference so far between offline storage at MtGox is that MtGox is not using that stored value to invest in something -- it is just sitting there unused.
What Bitcoin cannot allow, is for inflation to increase the reserve of the bank, when they run out. So your reserves must be much higher than in a fiat money system. If all the users request to withdraw money at once, and you don't have it all (because some was lent out) then you must put a hold on user accounts, or this bank has to declare bankruptcy.

avsa was talking about smartphone wallet software -- not QR vs NFC, and was probably thinking about using QR codes to pay on a website (since you can't even do that with NFC).
That said, NFC will not "beat" QR (nor does it have to) because:
- QR and NFC both require you to press the same number of buttons on your phone.
- It is currently very easy to display a QR code anywhere, but putting an NFC terminal next to the client's phone is harder (you can print NFC chips into magazine ads and so on though, although I have yet to see this happen so far). NFC will mainly be used by POS terminals in my opinion.
- There is no method (and no need for such a method) to pay via NFC on a website.
- QR codes are already widespread and any smartphone with a camera (all smartphones) can use them. A minority of smartphones currently have NFC tech.

This really screws with the bid or ask depth without the depth really being meaningful, and it affects what everyone else does.

Sigh. Bitcoin is not a solution to every financial situation imaginable, any more than cash is.
Think of bitcoin as digital cash, or a protocol. How does physical cash solve any of the problems you've outlined? It doesn't, and you don't stuff a bunch of physical cash in a vault that everyone has access to when you work for a big company.
We build services on top of bitcoin that solve all of the problems you enumerate, the same way that we build services that use physical cash that solve the problems you mention if you were storing your company value in physical cash.
There are so many different ways to solve the issues that you mentioned that I don't really know where to begin, because it depends greatly on the particular situation.
Right now, since we don't have a comprehensive service that is tailored to a company's use of bitcoin as a main store of value, (and since bitcoin is too volatile right now to use as a company chest), you could simply use bitcoin for what it's good at right now -- value transfer -- instead of value storage.
But if you want to use bitcoins as value storage for your company, then you can store your bitcoins wallet in a piece of software that requires multiple users to enter their passwords in order to move money out of the wallet if the amount is over a specified limit.
Each user has an account that can access the software individually, and they have a limit on what they can withdraw, to change the limit, multiple high ranking individuals have to enter their password together in order to change the limit.
Currently at [Ferroh]( **we are developing a service (almost done too!) that stores our bitcoins redundantly across many wallets (any number you want) and many computers**.
Each time you add a computer and a wallet, you make a physical paper wallet copy and put a copy of the (laminated) paper wallet in a safety deposit box and another copy in a safe.
When someone wants to withdraw money, a request is posted to a central server, and all of the wallet machines poll the server every few minutes, checking for requests. One of the wallet machines usually needs to win a lottery (unless it has way more bitcoins than the other machines) to be the machine that gets to fulfil the withdraw request.
If you pull a machine offline, the other machines can still fulfil the request. If you make a massive request, then the machines see coins moving from the public addresses of other machines in this group *by monitoring the public blockchain*, and then they halt and require multiple authorizing signatures from officials to continue.
In this way, you can distribute coins across many locations, machines, and networks, and protect your organization's value despite many people in your organization needing access to your bitcoins. It also mitigates the damage of a cracker stealing your coins, because you are limited to taking all the coins from 2-3 machines out of potentially hundreds, before they refuse to fill requests until they get multiple authority's signatures.
What's nice about this is that **you dont need the massive secure central server room** with 100 feet walls of concrete or whatever. You can just store 1000 bitcoins on a laptop in each of your employees living rooms -- and everything will work. If that employee steals the coins, he loses his job, and your company moves on. If a few employees computers break or are lost or whatever, the network still works, just temporarily without a few coins in the chest. If their house/apartment burns to the ground you can still get the coins from the wallet (paper backup at his safety deposit box).

You do not need to use a single file to represent a TrueCrypt encrypted drive.
You can dedicate an entire drive partition (or an entire drive) for use as a TrueCrypt volume.
I was originally speaking from the perspective of using a single file to represent a truecrypt drive, and joshuag uses an entire drive to represent his TrueCrypt volume, which is probably much of the source of our discussion/argument.
I **thought** that joshuag was suggesting that you can place a truecrypt hidden volume into an unencrypted drive (which you can't). If you could, then it would be placed in the unused portion of the drive, which would be filled with random data. This should be theoretically possible to do, but is not a supported use case with TrueCrypt. If you did, then depending on how the file system works, usage of the unencrypted drive could overwrite the hidden volume, when you write enough data.

Do your research then. If you like, go to  on irc.freenode.net and ask the other developers there if you don't believe me.
A recent patch to the satoshi client increased sync speeds by like 30% for many people because of optimizations that reduce the HDD bottleneck.
If you want to test yourself: 
Pass a command line argument to the satoshi client that specifies the wallet directory as one that is on a cheap USB key. It will take ***weeks*** to sync up, because of the read/write bottleneck, it doesn't matter if you have a 10000 GB/s internet connection.


If you just download the chain without verifying, you would be correct. But verifying the chain in the current implementation in the satoshi client requires many database read/writes which is where you see a massive HDD bottleneck.

They are probably within +/-30% of their estimates. But say they only get half of what they claim, that would still be an increase on the same order as CPU to GPU.
Also, this has been discussed ad infinitum in the bitcoin community and it is widely agreed that it will be an increase on the order of CPU -&gt; GPU.

Paypal doesn't like when you use it for bitcoin buying/selling.
Some possible methods:
- Sell physical coins. (Con: they are expensive.)
- Sell bitcoin for linden dollars, then trade linden dollars for USD, then cashout via paypal. (Con: there isn't enough volume on the linden dollar exchange, and when there eventually is, paypal might stop supporting that exchange.)

Good presentation.
I'd like to comment on one point you made, which is essentially that (paraphrasing) "the current version of bitcoin won't take off because the average person won't use it".
It's true that bitcoin is too difficult to use for your average person at the moment, but I think that new tools (e.g. bitcoin clients) and some small incremental Bitcoin protocol changes (such as multisig) can solve this problem.
Basically: We don't actually need Bitcoin 2.0 to make Bitcoin very user friendly, we just need some new tools.

Hi, I'm Kris Olhovsky, and I'm the programmer at Ferroh.
You can find me here:

- 
- 
Investors are not as willing to bear their facebook/gplus/blog life, so you'll have to settle for just me :)
I think I can answer your question:
**You should not do this if** you are not willing to take the risk that mining will not be worth it, or that Bitcoin will fail, or if you need to have coins right now, instead of trickling to you every hour over a year.
**You should do this if** you want bitcoins, want to invest in Bitcoin, and are willing to risk the viability of mining. You should also do this if you want to see mining move to green energy (our electricity is hydro powered, and rarely uses coal). You should also do this if you want to invest into Ferroh, where we are building multiple Bitcoin related services. The more steam we build, the easier it is to convince investors to jump on board and finance bigger and better stuff.

You stated yourself that calling Bitcoin "internet money" will (quoting YOU here) "*[drive] away regular folk*".
Bitcoin is a lot harder to use right now, than it will be in 2 years. If you introduce people Bitcoin to people who are scared off by using the internet, and they find it hard to use Bitcoin now, then do you think you will have improved their chances of trying it again in the near future when it actually ***IS*** easy to use?
I am the owner of  by the way, and I am working on making Bitcoin easier to use.
This is the exact opposite of elitism -- I am trying to build tools that make it easy for ***everyone*** to use this technology.

Uh no, it is not at all the same as just the combination of your laptop and smartphone.
Multisig allows people to use online wallets safely, and the wallet operators cannot steal your money, nor can someone who hacks the online wallet.
The ability for newcomers to use online wallets is a major barrier to adoption by non techies (most people).
Multisig could lead to massive adoption that isn't otherwise possible without trusting web based wallet services (remember mybitcoin?).

Indeed, they are working on some solutions. The satoshi client is not exactly elegant in this respect.


Was it actually 150 blocks per 6 hours?
I would expect it to take something like 10-15 hours to sync the entire chain with a drive like that, in my experience.


One option is to not use the satoshi client. Another, yes, is to leave the client running.
It should only take a total of 10-20 hours to sync the entire chain on your typical 7200rpm drive though, so if you are seeing numbers much worse than that, then maybe something else is going on.
You can try asking  on irc.freenode.net in that case.

- The banking system spends a huge amount of resources on people that keep track of transactions.

So pause for 100ms and then run the process for 500ms if you like. If there is a significant delay to starting the process (say 300ms), then you will end up "pausing" for 400ms and running the process for 500ms, at every iteration.

Well, I did forget about the checkpoints (of which there are 9), and like you said, they are hardcoded, so the developers add them somewhat randomly.
Here they are:


You can fork the chain back to whatever time you want later than the latest checkpoint. If you couldn't then bitcoin would easily break, since I could just get lucky and mine two (bad) blocks in a row and the rest of the miners would be screwed.

From what I gather, if you don't live in Russia, and you are a financial institution (bitcoin is likely a grey area in Russia at the moment), then you need to know your customer.
*However*, there were only 208 money laundering convictions in 2009 which is nothing (but who knows how many tax-evasion convictions). So you are right, Russia does not seem to enforce KYC rules very well, even if they do have them for foreign clients.
That said, the U.S. and other countries are putting pressure on Russia to implement stricter laws of this nature. This is difficult due to the level of corruption and crime in Russia -- which is closely tied to them having such weak enforcement of money laundering laws to begin with.
All that said, I don't really care about Russian law at the moment, because BTC-E is not a very impressive service. Their deposit/withdraw services are often down, they pick up every alt-chain that they can, the chat there (which you can't turn off) is filled with trolls and immature children, and the interface is not very good.

If you label the item intangible then they won't cover your loss, which is why you can be scammed. They just said this in the quote you gave.

**Edit:** The point is that the seller AND buyer are both not protected when the item is intangible -- therefore there can be no paypal chargeback.
The problem is that if the card was stolen, or the card buyer claims the transaction did not go as intended to his credit card company, then the payment can still be charged back.

What? No.
Bitcoin has a market cap today of about $45 million ($5 * 9 million coins).
If block rewards were 10x higher, all else being equal, then the price of a bitcoin would be $0.5 instead of $5, and the market cap would still be $45 million ($5 * 90 million).
How large of a unit you decide divide the currency into really makes no difference. We could have said that there would only ever be at most 1 bitcoin, instead of 21 million of them, and we would have had to adjust the price accordingly. All else being equal, the value of Bitcoin would be the same, we would just have the decimal point in a different place.

Fractional reserve banking is possible with Bitcoin, but I'm guessing that you don't really know what that is :)
Fractional reserve banking just refers to holding only part of user's accounts in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
Actually this is likely already done by sites like MtGox, where many of the coins are held in offline storage -- that is a fractional reserve!
The difference so far between offline storage at MtGox is that MtGox is not using that stored value to invest in something -- it is just sitting there unused.
What Bitcoin cannot allow, is for inflation to increase the reserve of the bank, when they run out.
So bank reserves should be much higher than in a fiat money system. If all the users request to withdraw money at once, and you don't have it all available right now (because some is invested somewhere) then you must put a hold on user accounts until that money becomes available.
I see from the discussion in this thread that it appears that many people here seem to think that fractional reserve banking refers to lending more money than the bank has. This is ***not*** the case. Banks are not allowed to lend more than they have in deposits, it violates FDIC rules in the USA, and similar rules in other countries.
Fractional reserve lending just means that the bank is only holding some of the deposits in reserve for immediate withdrawal.

Gizram84's reasoning was faulty (things dont have value just because it took resources to get them), but Bitcoin is often claimed to have "intrinsic" value.
First: It has valuable properties (resistance to government intervention, ease of transfer, efficiency of transfer, etc) and so people want to trade with it.
Second: It has some uses that are completely separate from it's ability to be traded (carbon dating documents, public verifiable random number generation).

You can't keep blocks from getting into the chain if they contain solutions -- what happens is that the "chain" (really a tree) forks into two chains and those two chains compete.


Actually they could just solve blocks until they at some point have enough to split the chain back 24 hours ago, and THEN publish the blocks. They don't need to publish the blocks at the moment they solve them.
In fact, if you had the processing power, you could "go back in time" and split the chain from any arbitrary point if you want to. You could split the chain right now all the way back from the genesis block -- but this is crazy expensive computationally, so it won't happen.

It does feel like justice somehow, to those who are jealous of his profits, and angry about the volatility he caused.
That said, if his screenshots are real, and there is some reason to think that they are, then this does look a little concerning.
We see that the price that liquidated his position occured with far less volume moving the price up compared to the volume that moved the price down.
Why bitcoinica allows 10:1 leverage is beyond me...
All that said, the volume before and after the crash looks balanced to me:
Notice that the heatmap shows the sum of volume over a wider period. Bar volume charts can have one large bar surrounded by several small ones, but in this case we are interested in the average of the volume over a period longer than just one bar.

You can see the current price at mtgox.com (about $6/bitcoin at the time of writing this).
So ฿1.19*$6.00/฿ = $7.14/month.
Alternatively, here is a calculator that uses the current network difficulty and bitcoin price:
Enter 45 MH/s for your nvidia card, or [look up other hardware]( to see what AMD gpus are doing (about 5x as much).
Do not try to mine on an nvidia card. They are terrible for mining -- you will pay more in electricity than you will get back in bitcoins.

Note that how fast the difficulty increases greatly depends on:
- the fixed cost of this new tech
- the marginal cost of the new tech
- mining investor/speculator emotions
What do you mean by "more efficient"? More MH/watt? More MH/$?
If you had tech that costs $1000 per 100MH, but costs pennies per year to operate, then difficulty would adjust very slowly, because the cost to buy more equipment is high, which means that miners will be able to buy a limited amount of additional power right away.
Miners also cooperate (naturally) somewhat to keep difficulty low, because if miners see a brand new efficient tech, they are going to be hesitant to jump in with too much mining power, because they also know that others will jump in, which would increase the difficulty.
In other words, if ***everyone*** can buy new mining tech, you know that the difficulty is going to jump, and therefore make the purchase of new mining tech riskier, so fewer people accept the higher risk.
In the end, how long it takes to pay off that mining equipment based on a projection at the current rate, is a good place to start making a guess about how much difficulty will increase.
FPGAs for example currently are very power efficient (low marginal cost), but cost so damn much in fixed costs, that difficulty has been rising somewhat slowly, because it takes over a year to pay for themselves using an optimistic projection, so few people buy them, and when they do buy, they can't afford a huge amount (compared to GPUs) due to the high fixed cost per hash.

It's perfectly fine to ask to discuss bitcoin related arguments.
What you are mostly arguing is just that the argument I linked to is not Bitcoin related.
I think it is very Bitcoin related. If it arms Bitcoin users with knowledge of something that is often discussed when discussing Bitcoin, then it is useful for this community to understand the argument.
Even if there is no winning side to this argument, as you suggest, then it is useful to know ***that***.


This is the first I've heard that fiat is so subjective. I thought it was a very concrete idea: Government law declares currency valuable, then it is fiat, if not, then not.

If you want to allow users to auto withdraw, then you need a hot wallet.
Name a pool that doesn't have auto withdrawal?


Since it was a pool, it's likely that all of the transactions were very small (&lt;4 BTC each). There are thousands of users at that pool.
So having the hot wallet on some different server would not have done anything, at least not using any of the suggestions that you've mentioned.
One thing that could have been done though, is locking customer addresses on a separate server, so that the attacker could not make withdraw requests to different addresses without setting off some alarm bells.

The question of whether you should get a BFL ASIC doesn't really depend on electricity.
It depends on whether you think they will deliver this product, and whether you think difficulty will increase too fast to make it worth it.
More than one person, experienced with processor design, has pointed out that they think their numbers are not possible with current generation processors.
If BFL can't meet their production targets (in performance or the time deadline), there is a concern that they will be forced with the following decision:
Refund customer money, or take it and run. (And if you think they can't run with the money just because we know they have a Delaware corporation -- remember that so does Zhou Tong.)
They are paid this time around with non-reversible methods ONLY (bitcoin and bank wires).
My primary concern at this moment is that they are scheduled to release their product 2 months from now, and still haven't released a single photo of any of their ASIC products. If they are going to meet demand, you'd think they'd be starting production by now, right?

It doesn't seem like you thought this through at all, sorry.
You suggest that the Linode hack wouldn't have been a problem because the stolen coins would have been charged back, but either:
a) Coins can be charged back for a limited amount of time, in which case virtually all of the linode coins would not be able to be charged back because Bitcoinica wouldn't allow you to trade with coins that can be charged back.
or 
b) If anyone who spends coins can charge back the coins at any time, then it is a useless currency that no one can trust. Traditional money systems like Visa or Paypal can do chargebacks because they are a 3rd party authority that decides whether to do a chargeback. You can't give chargeback power to anyone and everyone who spends their coins (at least not without making some significant other addition that you haven't mentionted).

Ugh, how many times do we need to rehash this discussion.
2 years of blocks is a short time, and the lost bitcoin "problem" is not a problem -- just divide coins further.
So you want to essentially require that everyone has a wallet program that automatically sends coins to themselves often enough so that they don't have to worry about their coins getting destroyed -- thus bloating the blockchain with pointless transactions of people sending coins to themselves.
People aren't going to settle for resending their coins once per year either -- it's going to be daily or weekly just to be safe.
So this makes the "problem" that you want to solve potentially even worse.
Thick clients can easily store all of the block chain without worry. Thin clients don't need to store the block chain.

Could someone have used this hack to influence speculators and cause [today's massive price fall](
(Or perhaps a bot was using the mtgox live feed for their data.)

This attack is almost impossible to pull off, and it is completely fixed in 0.6.0.
You need to have quite a lot more than 51% of the mining power to pull this off, and even then it's a pain to do.
You need a fork that splits back 24 hours ago, and is also longer than the current chain. This requires a 51% of the network power, and a lot of luck, or 60-70% of the mining power and a bit of luck. And you need to do it all before 0.6.0 is released. If this somehow happened, we would probably reset the chain back to before this event occurred, and release 0.6.0 early.
Bitcoin is still quite secure, is what I'm trying to say, and there's good reason to think that the protocol will continue to be viewed as secure for a very long time.

We are currently working on or looking into a total of 7 different primary projects including the mining operation.
To get the cost of equipment low, we spent most of our capital on the mining operation.
To reduce our risk, get some capital back, and hopefully generate some good relationships with future customers of other services, we are offering these mining contracts.
Ferroh has long term plans for profit generation. We might find that we would have made more money by keeping the hashing power to ourselves, but then again, we'd lose out on the capital we need right now for other services, and the benefit of developing relationships with clients.
It's also difficult to pitch to investors when a bulk of our capital is tied up in mining, and much easier to pitch when we have many interested clients, and diversified investments.
Let me know if you have any other questions, I'll try to respond to them all when I wake up tomorrow :)

We *are* keeping some of it to ourselves, but we also gain by selling some of it to the community.

The point of the "betting" is to ensure that the job is actually getting done by the person receiving the funds.
In your kickstarter-like idea, it would be extremely difficult to ensure that the people getting paid do the job actually do the job (instead of just running off with the funds), and if they fail (i.e. get killed during the job), all the money raised is lost.
I think you fail to see why kickstarter works. People start projects, and then present their project and who they are, to convince people to donate. They people receiving the funds have already started their creative project and have huge incentive to finish (because they gain much more when the project is done, and they've already invested into it). None of that is the case in the "market" you propose. In fact it's mostly the opposite! Assassins want to be anonymous, not showcase themselves, and the big part of their payoff is from the kickstarter-like funding, not from the project completion. They have more incentive to just take the money and not do the illegal job that you are paying them to do.

NFC enabled phones could use an NFC scan just as easily as a QR code, which would be more convenient and faster.
I agree that QR codes are not optimal at a coffee shop, but it's very easy to scan a QR code on a website to pay. I think it's easier than logging into paypal to pay.
I think that if the QR code entered the amount to send and name of the receiver into your phone, and you just had to press confirm (similar to what happens when you pay by debit), then this would be fast and convenient, about the same as debit. This is even faster and more convenient when you sub in "NFC swipe" for "QR code".

Define "most valuable/expensive". Do you mean that the price of a bitcoin at $5 each is higher than the price per unit of any other currency?
If that's what you mean, then that is very faulty logic. The size of the currency unit is irrelevant.
The Yen could be doing better than the USD even if it is priced at $0.02 per Yen, because the denominations are somewhat arbitrary.
If the Bitcoin block rewards were set to 500 instead of 50, then we'd likely have bitcoins priced at $0.5 each instead of $5 each, and everything else would basically be the same -- that doesn't mean that Bitcoin would be "worth less", just that 1 bitcoin would be priced lower.

Please follow my argument and tell me where it fails, rather than downvoting my every response and telling me that I'm just handwaving.
I have already made many points to support this point of view:
- Bitcoin needs a more powerful distributed computer than anyone else's -- and we *already* have this.
- Economy of scale reduces processing power costs with growth (e.g. consider the marginal costs of ASICs).
- When mining scales up, larger firms operate at a reduced cost (again, economy of scale), which creates a barrier to entry for mining by new users.

There are various ways that M of N signing and Open Transactions can make this secure, and I'm hesitant at this point to say that one way or another way is the best.
Basically though, you don't give all your keys to the web wallet (or at least not to one web wallet).
But to spend your coins, the transaction would require all keys to sign it.
You can choose to have as many keys required as you want (could be 1 like it is now, or it could be 2, or it could be 100).
So one way is to use two services, the web wallet that spends your coins, and another web wallet that signs the transaction for you (or you use an app on your phone to sign the transaction, or your PC client, or whatever).
Another way is to extend that to a web of federated servers, and use transactions that require as many keys as there are servers.
Another way is to spend using a script that reverses transactions if the web of federated servers votes on the blockchain to do so, because they see that one of the federated servers has done something bad. In this scenario, you would be spending coins using a script that requires something like 8/10 key signatures to spend.
That's what this guy proposes:
I personally feel that approach is flawed.
The point though is that Open Transactions and M of N signing gives us many options, and that secure web wallets are definitely a possibility in the near future.

Okay, if an attacker can display whatever he wants to the user, then an OTP won't save you.
So, replace the app on your phone that generates the OTP with an app that instead shows you the amount being sent and the destination address -- and you just click confirm on your phone.
So in this case, it doesn't matter if grandma's computer is compromised.
(Also, according to you, iOS is trojan proof.)
Alternately, if the 3rd party limits daily sending to some fraction of your account balance (like a bank might) then the damage could be limited.
At least in this case merely having a trojan on your computer doesn't mean you lose your coins -- until it asks you for your OTP somehow, and you enter it.


That is ONE trojan, on OSX only. I can assure you that if 600k users lose their bitcoins, that many people will stop using bitcoins.
Consider that 0.5% is 1/200. If one in 200 bitcoin users lose their coins, it will seem like everyone is losing their coins -- imagine how many posts and news stories would be about bitcoins being lost.
There are many millions of trojans in the wild.

Good explanation, but I am not wrong. In fact you are agreeing with some points I've made in argument against joshuag.
In fact it is you that is at least, not quite right.
I have used TrueCrypt volumes and I know how they work. I am at a loss for words when I see that you **and** joshuag are being upvoted while I am downvoted, presumably just because joshuag had a slight lead in upvotes before me, and sheep are following whatever the current vote status is.
joshuag is plain wrong, and you are mostly right.


You can use the outer volume without a password to the hidden volume. That is the whole point. Do you potentially overwrite the contents of the hidden volume ***if*** you write too much data? Yes. But you still don't need the password to the hidden volume -- that's the whole point! (Otherwise it wouldn't really be hidden, would it!)
If you don't believe me, open TrueCrypt and try this yourself.

Yeah, except that you don't need to store all of your Bitcoins at the one address that the government knows about, and you can make 1+ confirmation transactions from the other addresses...
Edit: Upon further reflection:
If the government deems it illegal to accept money from an unregistered address, and illegal to receive transactions from any address that has received money from an unregistered address in the past, then this could be very effective... and scary. ~~The government would know exactly where all of your money has gone.~~
Edit 2:
The government would also have to deem mixing illegal (two people pay one address, then money goes to other addresses -- you dont know which money came from where with the blockchain alone), which would be close to impossible. So this idea actually doesn't work out after all. It was a good thought experiment though.

It would not be a good idea to buy GPUs exclusively for this purpose.
If you already have GPUs that can do it, then if your electricity is lower than the mining cost, then sure.
You will get something like 0.25 BTC per day with 500 MHash/sec. You will use something like 6 KWH per day.
This assumes decent ATI cards that are not overclocked.
Take your price per KWH and the price per BTC, and figure out if the price of BTC is higher than your electricity cost.

If you buy 10000 BTC, the **ask** price immediately goes up, but the *bid price does not change* unless bidders decide to increase their bids.
Often you can raise the ask by making a massive buy, but then the **bid and ask prices meet somewhere in the middle**.
Here's an example to illustrate this:
Buying 10000 BTC at $3.00/BTC to start means that the rest of the asks are higher. When you are done buying up 10000 BTC, the ask price is now say, $3.20. So your average buy price was maybe $3.10 (but probably higher than that since volumes tend to be lower closer to the lowest ask).
The bid price is still $2.99.
Bidders raise their bids, and askers lower their asks slightly, and the price meets at $3.10.
If you sell now, even if you could sell everything at the current bid price (you can't because there are maybe only 1000-2000 BTC at that price), then you would lose money.
The only way that a sudden 10000 BTC purchase can make you money, is if you trigger an upward movement from many other buyers.

To answer this simply in the terms that you used:
If you made a massive scheduled and calculated buy, the market price would go up, but then steadily come back down, although "not fully".
If you make a big sudden buy or sell, you're going to move the price, but the price will correct back as other speculators don't think that the price should have moved that fast -- unless you sell and trigger sells of other speculators, or unless you buy and trigger buys from other speculators that think the price is moving up and will continue to.
The likely result of a ***community*** purchase of 10K BTC would be that anyone who knows the purchase is happening, will set up sells that will take advantage of it.

You don't have to trust them. They would not be able to steal more in a couple of days (which is all they'd get if they changed their JS) than they'd get by continuing service.
Even if the entire bitcoin user population started using this service over the next year, they would only be able to gain 1 or 2 day's worth of deposits while running malicious javascript. They would make more than that by simply continuing service for a couple of months. Why would they forfeit their entire business for a tiny short term payoff?
The point is that the tiny security increase against a tiny loss is not at all worth the much larger inconvenience of an out of browser application, that this site is preventing us from having to use in the first place.

If you provide an application option (which is unnecessary and is primarily what i've been responding to in this sub-thread), then additional complexity may inhibit the growth of bitcoin, as some users will perceive not using the out of browser executable as unsafe.

It is one or two individuals manipulating the price.
There was a massive selloff and then this individual put up $100k bid walls, and moved them around sometimes every few minutes from $2.30 to $2.40 to $2.50 to $2.70 to $2.50 again.
It's pretty clear that those bid walls were set by just one or two people.
**At one point there was a $200k+ bid wall at $2.50 and simultaneously a $20k sell wall at $2.50001.**
Think about that. That is the work of someone who wants to influence where you buy -- not someone who wants to sell at $2.50.

This is nothing compared to what the NSA or CIA spend on various projects.

I am not proposing a new decentralized currency.
I am proposing a service that accepts bitcoins. To back the value of bitcoins, we need more merchants.
This service is somewhat like a mining pool -- it collects mining power at one central location, and pays out miners daily.
It collects money from clients of this merchant, and passes the income on to miners that contribute to this service.
This service could choose to reject password cracking computation, which is the answer to your (1).

Some of your points don't make much sense (like BTC demand decreasing because funds are held for a week as USD).
However this:


might make some sense.
A couple of tiers in, mtgox fees are 0.5% per trade. So 1% of money is lost to MtGox per purchase at the Silk Road. MtGox is probably constantly exchanging BTC to USD, decreasing BTC value.
I don't know how much of an effect this has -- but if MtGox reduced their fees to something like 0.1% for high volume traders like Silk Road, it would help the BTC economy at least a little bit.

Multiple news outlets used your quote.
News articles have influenced Bitcoin prices in the past -- in fact they influence the price of all publicly traded commodities.
The connection here seems pretty obvious. A distribution of the idea that the price will fall to $1 in a week to thousands of people would not likely *increase* the BTC price.


Are you trolling me?
A "slight stabilization" -- I'm not sure what that even means. Over what time period is "slight"? How do we know that the value wouldn't be at $3 if not for all of the bad press in the last 24 hours?
It is much much more likely that the bad press has contributed to a falling price, rather than this news somehow "slightly stabilizing" the price.

You are essentially proposing that people viewing your page run some app (a java applet for example) that verifies a single share for your mining pool.
There are so many problems with this, but the biggest ones are:
- The cost to you of giving them a tiny chunk of work to do will cancel out the gain you get from them.
- The benefit of CPU mining from the client is *tiny*.
Perhaps if you are having them mine while they simultaneously view your site, and they have to keep submitting shares to keep their session alive.
You need to also solve the problem of being able to have more than one site open at a time that both require mining.
How much hash power is enough? Are you willing to accept low hash power clients? Are you willing to lose money on the bandwidth costs of accepting low hash power clients?
Not to mention how easy it would be to simply reduce hashpower by delaying incoming and outgoing proof of work requests/results.

Sort of.
It's relatively easy to verify their javascript once.
After that, if they change their javascript maliciously, they will be called on it as soon as someone notices -- that's a high risk to them, and a low reward. How long do you think it would take for someone to notice that their javascript changed? How many bitcoins would they get in that short period vs what they gain by running their service for a long time?
Hell, someone could even write a script that checks to see if their page source is the same every day.


Uh, they might break one password per week on average let's say, in the best case (and probably a lot slower than that).
It won't be worth it for this service to give up everything so that they can access 52 bitcoin addresses per year. By the time a year passes, they'll have made more in fees than the value of the passwords that they cracked.
This could be mitigated by switching to RSA2048, and not being able to crack a single address for years -- though it seems unnecessary to me.

Having not used BitInstant before, it wasn't obvious to me at all, but BitInstant is out of money right now.
This is why you can't make a transfer at the moment.
Edit: I got some money into TradeHill.
My experience so far has been pretty horrible.
If you make 3 BTC withdrawals it says: 
"*You already have two outstanding withdraw requests like this. Please choose a different method or wait for your current requests to complete*"
- The BTC withdraw form has 8 boxes some labelled A,B,C,D,E,F,G. Do the extra boxes do anything?
- The order screens don't show you how much money you have. Making orders is a real pain compared to MtGox.
- They don't show you the bid/ask. (The "instant buy/sell" prices are **not** the bid/ask prices.)
**And my withdraw requests have been "in process" for an hour.** (They are not yet broadcast.)
Gareth from BitInstant was a big help. He contacted TradeHill for me and got them to speed up my withdrawals manually.

It seems to me that adjusting the block rewards once per **4 years** was a small mistake.
Why couldn't they have been adjusted once per week instead? Now we have to deal with speculation about what will happen at the 4 year mark, creating more instability. Also, if block rewards were decreasing often, then perhaps we wouldn't be discussing this "inflationary period" in this way at all.

I don't really understand what problem you're trying to solve exactly.
Do you want to be able to pay without having your iPhone/Android phone with you?
Offline payment is possible, (e.g. print a QR code representing a public+private key with some bitcoins at that address). But why would we need that?
If you really need offline payment, traditional payment methods can serve as a backup. We're a long way from requiring offline Bitcoin payments imo.
Or is your question just "how do I pay with Bitcoins in person"?
The answer is that you just get a Bitcoin iPhone or Android app, and scan the QR code of the address that you want to send to at the establishment.
Here's an example of this in action:

I don't think that you understand what happened to that money in the case of Lehman Brothers, or what happened to the bitcoin in the case of Mt.Gox.
In both cases the money was *not* destroyed. When Lehman brothers stock plummetted, it's not because someone **burned** some paper bills. Electronic money was trasferred around, that's all. The money still existed, though it's value may have changed.
When Mt.Gox was hacked, no one lost their money -- hashed passwords and usernames were retrieved, but you can't log in with a hashed password (unless you crack the hash).
The value of bitcoin dropped as a result of faith in the bitcoin security decreasing.
No one deleted the bitcoins, their value just changed due to speculation.

I think you forgot to ask about the fixed costs of this card.
In the OP article they say the MSRP is **$549**.
[You can currently buy a 5870]( that does 380MH/s at stock voltage/clock for **$140**.
1. If you care about electricity costs:
Even if the 7970 doubles the MH/watt efficiency of the 5870, it will likely take over a year to pay off the price difference between these cards.
2. If you don't care about electricity costs:
You will get better MH/$ from the 5870.
3. It probably does not double the hashing efficiency of the 5870, so reconsider 1.

Yes, but if someone like Swiss Chalet started accepting bitcoins, people would need millions of bitcoins to pay for their meals. Those would mostly be purchased now. If bitcoin holders wanted to get rid of their bitcoins, they would do it -- they aren't waiting to be able to unload thousands of dollars of bitcoins at Swiss Chalet.
In the beginning, we need these services that convert bitcoins directly to dollars in order to gain bitcoin acceptance. Merchants that dont need to convert immediately to USD will pop up later, when the prices are more stable.
On that note, more merchants accepting bitcoins will stabilize prices, as higher transaction volumes will reduce the effect of bitcoin day traders changing prices will small trades.
Stabler prices mean less direct conversion to USD, and so on.

You need to start by obtaining bitcoins -- if doing so associates your name with a bitcoin address then this will pose a problem for you.
If the bitcoin address of the anonymous escrow service does not comply with anti-money-laundering laws then when your coins are seen going to that service, that is a big red flag -- and gives authorities reason to investigate you.
My only point is that you need more than just Tor+Bitcoin to make you anonymous. But yes, it is possible.

As I said in my other comment, relative to the number of coins out there, the amount of currency added in 20 years is almost the same as the amount added with bitcoin (i.e. both are close to zero, getting closer and closer to zero with time).
I.e.: 
 - The amount of currency added per block with BTC in 20 years is 1.5 coins per block, and the amount of bitcoins will be about 20 million.
 - The amount of currency added per block with TBX in 20 years is 25 coins per block, and the amount of tenebrix will be about 1300 million.
The percentage growth of the tenebrix money supply in 20 years will be ***.0000019%*** per block.
The percentage growth of the bitcoins money supply in 20 years will be ***.0000075%*** per block.
So actually, in 20 years, ***MORE*** bitcoins will be added to the economy relative to the size of the economy than will be with tenebrix, even though tenebrix is linear instead of exponential.
So by your argument, there should be more incentive for early adopters with tenebrix than litecoin, over a 20 year period?

Actually, it would be very trivial. Accepting bitcoins and checking market prices on MtGox via their API to build a moving average of bitcoin price is actually quite easy -- very trivially easy for a company like Amazon. They already have the infrastructure to accept payments from their customers, adding in bitcoin support is a small change indeed.


What? As you pointed out yourself, the bitcoin market is small, so small organizations would benefit, and bitcoin investors would benefit from small organizations accepting payments.


You're confusing the issue. Bitcoins are currently not accepted due to several issues, one of them is that right now, I wouldn't recommend the use of the bitcoin client to non technical users. However, when these obstacles are overcome (e.g. with new and better bitcoin client software, which is on the way) then bitcoin will be adopted. I didn't say that bitcoins should be accepted **right now**, I said that they will be soon. Bitcoins will be easier to pay with, cost less to transfer, and allow consumers to avoid taxes. Remember that ***you*** picked Amazon, not me. Maybe Amazon shouldn't accept bitcoins, I don't know, I didn't say that they should. Any business that accepts a payment method like paypal, could benefit from accepting bitcoins instead. Many people would be happy to switch away from paypal to bitcoins. Bitcoin payment from a smartphone via a QR code scan at checkout could be a lot more pleasant than logging into paypal -- especially if you can also pay in this same way at your local coffee shop.


You're putting the chicken before the egg, or whatever the expression is -- an 800 lb chicken in a china shop before the egg (or whatever current meme we're working on here in Your reasoning is that no one can accept bitcoins because there aren't enough bitcoin users, but there aren't enough bitcoin users because no one accepts bitcoins? If Amazon started accepting bitcoins, then there would be more bitcoin users. But again, I'm not suggesting that Amazon is a good candidate for bitcoin acceptance right now.
- Local coffee shops are good candidates.
- World of Warcraft (and other games with monthly bills or paid items) could be paid for much more easily by kids without credit cards. Many people pay a premium for game cards at the store instead.
- Anyone who accepts paypal as payment is a potential candidate for accepting bitcoins as payment.


To be honest, I'm not sure what Amazon's lawyers would have to say about accepting bitcoins. So that's a good point. However, if paypal is accepted, and a reputable company starts providing a paypal like service that uses bitcoins (e.g. if MtGox started allowing instant payments out of your MtGox account via an API, like paypal does), then I don't see why Amazon couldn't safely accept that. The legal burden would then fall to MtGox, who accept both bitcoins and USD.
Moving forward, a service like this (that provides small instant transactions) is probably necessary for certain types of transactions -- like buying coffee.

True, but the patch to prevent this sort of attack is trivially small. (It was released 1-2 days after the attack on SolidCoin.)
Bitcoin is more resistant to the attack compared to SolidCoin due to the much larger number of clients and miners.

Yeah it's a valid point, and I wouldn't have allowed Bitcoins to have 8 decimals. I would have likely chosen 1 decimal place. (So you could currently buy say, 100K bitcoins with 1 pound).
That said, if I did that, then back when Bitcoin first started out (when bitcoins cost $0.0001 each), then one bitcoin would have cost say, 1 pound, and then you have the same problem that you're describing right now, except worse because they didn't have much adoption and would have less divisibility :P

Don't forget to upvote that thread as well -- this is an easy way to point out one of Bitcoin's strengths to a wide audience.
I've spent the last hour writing about bitcoin in the best way I know how to, hopefully keeping a sober perspective and modest goals for the future of bitcoin. I have to say, it's really frustrating to meet a wave of downvotes followed by a wave of upvotes followed by a wave of downvotes as various comments appear in response to my posts.
From the responses I've seen, generally I would say that people have the idea in their heads that bitcoin has failed because the price has fallen. So you might do well to start letting people know that bitcoin can function as a payment system regardless of the price.

If bitcoin can buy more goods/services then more people will buy bitcoins with USD, and more people will hold bitcoins in order to be able to make future purchases, driving the price of bitcoins up.

I am *not* trying to create a new currency or alter bitcoins protocol in ***any way***.
I am **not** suggesting that we can do arbitrary computation to secure a cryptocurrency blockchain.
I am suggesting that a completely separate piece of software from Bitcoin can be used to provide a service that people can pay for with ***any currency***. Amazon already offers such a currency for USD.
I am suggesting that we offer this currency in Bitcoins, since it will be supported primarily by ex-bitcoin-miners, and will be created by the Bitcoin community.
I am suggesting this, because we suddenly have a very large number of GPGPU computers unused (ex mining rigs).
I think that I have made it very clear in various comments in this thread as well as in the OP that I am suggesting ***nothing*** like what you continue to make comments about.
I am suggesting that we make a service similar to EC2 -- what does that have to do with "armwaving that feature [into Bitcoin]"?
I'm not suggesting that we add *any* features to Bitcoin.

Obviously. You write a piece of software that runs only CUDA code.


Isn't OpenCL or CUDA already GPU computation only?
I have to admit that I have limited exposure to these tools though.
Also theoretically you could run this on a virtual machine, which would make your machine untouchable -- though there may be an easier way to sandbox this.
Another deterrent would be to have clients pay a deductible, which they would lose if they broke the TOS by running malicious code, which could save everyone time. This deductible could be paid out to the miners when it is taken. That's just an idea off the top of my head -- I'm not sure if it's a great model.

That looks like a polished service. Nice work.
~~But... you have access to everyone's passwords right? So we have to trust you, and trust that your site will not be hacked. Am I right?~~
Your encryption is browser side.
This looks really good -- I've been waiting for someone to do this.
I haven't vetted it fully, but so far it looks like this ~~turtoise~~ ianpurton guy has a pretty amazing and semi-revolutionary service.
- Browser side encryption that treats your bitcoin keys as a black box. Only you know the contents.
- A separate password per bitcoin address (unlike the standard bitcoin client), so keyloggers can only grab the password of one address at a time.
- Hacking this site will not compromise your wallet -- as long as the browser side javascript is implemented correctly.
- The owner of this site cannot run off with your wallet -- because only you hold the decryption key to your data -- not the site owner.
This deserves a lot of attention.
*** Edit: ***
- **But**, there is a significant problem. [See this post by *queus*](
StrongCoin could provide different JS code to known long time users, stealing any new BTC addresses that they create.
Preventing this would require some annoyingly semi-complicated auditing of their site by a 3rd party, or the distribution of a script that checks their site that would be in use by a sufficiently large fraction of their userbase.
I think that this is a decent deterrent, that would probably prevent them from ever trying such a thing, but it's certainly not ideal.
They have a 3rd party checking service in place that would prevent this from allowing hackers to take advantage of this.
A better ultimate solution is to have a signed application that runs in the browser (such as a google gears app). This wouldn't be possible to modify without user consent (the browser prompts you when the application is changed).
- Also, ~~there is no SSL certificate~~, which leaves open a man in the middle attack, that could have you use maliciously modified JS. However the solution to this is simple and probably imminent.
**Edit:** He added an SSL cert.
- Also, I just read his JS code, and the cryptography code is 1200 lines of **obfuscated** code. Which is probably more like 3000 lines when unobfuscated and it would take a long while to verify that it is safe, unless it is derived from a well known library. This needs to be unobfuscated at the least.

It always costs the same NMC to buy a domain as far as I know. When the price is high, it costs more USD to buy a domain.
So I guess I'm not sure what you're trying to say.


What does that mean? What does it mean for a currency to "rise"? Do you mean the USD/NMC price? Do you mean that the supply of NMC will increase? (The supply of NMC decreases over time by the way.)
My original point was that not many people will want to register an NMC domain (.bit) for example, at say $100 each, when you can register a .com for $10. So the ridiculously high NMC prices were deterring people from buying NMC domains, and this was hurting NMC.

Using idle cpu power consumes additional electricity. Modern CPUs constantly vary clock speed and voltage based on the current need. Using "idle" cpu power will cost cpu owners money -- more than the mining will pay back. 
Comparing torrent trackers to bitcoin miners seems silly to me as the dependence is not on a particular miner as it is with torrents. Miners can come and go without hurting the bitcoin network. Bittorrent trackers are not decoupled from the torrents that they track in this way. Maybe you'd feel better if mining software was merged into the client software and a checkbox was placed somewhere to turn on mining when the client's box is idle.

Microsoft Windows was absolutely horrible for years and years. It was no so long ago that it was common to have to reboot your computer several times per day because blue screens were an accepted way of life. The OS was incredibly vulnerable and millions (perhaps even billions) were lost to machines running Windows, that were compromised by malicious crackers.
It survived, and today Windows 7 is a polished, well made product, that dominates the marketplace.
As someone who has been a little irritated with Microsoft policy for a long time, I don't really like comparing closed source Microsoft Windows to Bitcoin. The point though, is that Bitcoin is a new technology, and it's still very young. It takes time for a new tech to mature and become stable.

However, Bitcoin's value is backed by the merchants who accept Bitcoins.
If you know that you can trade your Bitcoins for things with value, then your bitcoins have value tied to those things which you can trade them for.
Right now the big items for trade with Bitcoin are USD (and other fiat currencies) at exchanges, and drugs at the Silk Road.
I want to add another valuable item for trade with Bitcoin -- compute power. We are about to (or have already) gain a bunch of machines that are capable of GPGPU computing, that have already been paid for, but are no longer useful to the miners who used to profit from them.

I don't see where the OP clearly points out what happens in the common case where Bitcoin has a fractional reserve of BTC or USD. Zhou actually is the one that eventually *touches* on this.
Even if he did, that's not the point, *the original post paints a very different picture of how Bitcoinica operates from the way that it actually does*. Namely, he completely ignores the fractional reserve nature of Bitcoinica, which is a key feature of a market maker bot service.
The original poster made this thread in response to the recent situation at Bitcoinica ("to clear things up") -- but he does little to explain why this situation has happened in the original post! In fact, from reading the original post only, one might wonder how it could possibly be that one cannot withdraw from Bitcoinica, because the OP makes it sound like Bitcoinica can never lose money, and can always cover your position -- which is totally false.

They are very useful, but as you point out are not necessarily a good indicator of what the price will do far into the future (and sometimes a bad indicator of the price in the near future as well).
The depth chart tells you how much you will influence the price by buying/selling, and how much money someone else needs to move the price by how much at this moment.
So in that sense it is an indicator of stability, and the market's confidence of the current price.
Sometimes we see very very little depth near the current price. There have been occasions where $100 could move the price up or down 3%. That's a useful fact to know.
Sometimes we see very high depth near the current price (as I write this there is $2500 to move the price down 0.1%, and $3000 to move the price up 0.1%). This is useful information to know as well, especially if you are wanting to buy bitcoins at this moment.

Adjusting the block reward once per week (or once per day, or once per second) instead of once per 4 years while keeping the halving rate the same, would give us the same length "distribution phase", it would just happen over a smooth curve, instead of a sharp sudden change at the 4 year mark.
So it doesn't matter what the rate at which the bitcoin economy grows at is. It would be nice to be able to pick a better halving rate to match economic growth -- but as you say, you can't really predict the economic growth. However, changing the rate at which block rewards are updated doesn't need to change the halving rate.
@_date: 2011-10-21 00:05:09
Yes it is possible to make a completely anonymous currency in a strict mathematical sense.
The already existing [Open Transactions]( system has a "cash only" mode that provides a high level of anonymity, although I do not know for certain whether it is strictly perfectly anonymous.
It's also possible to use money laundering services that receive and send bitcoins from a single address, from many users, which when your coins are sent through the mixing service can only be narrowed down to the number of users who also use the laundering service.
It is also possible to premine coins in a blockchain for the purpose of laundering money -- although there will be a finite supply of launderable coins.
There may be other methods of creating a currency with this function in mind, however the closest that we already have is Open Transactions.

It sounds like you're saying that either it has to completely replace fiat currency and everything has to be purchasable with bitcoins and it will be worth a lot, or you can only buy some things with bitcoin and it is worth very little.
Can you pay your electricity bill or rent with paypal? Many people still use Paypal. There is some middle ground where bitcoin is very valuable, without being totally ubiquitous.
Also, where are you getting these prices from? Why is $5 the price when people can't entirely live off bitcoins? If Amazon.com started accepting bitcoins, and millions of people suddenly started using them just to buy things on Amazon, the price would shoot up to at least $30 in a week, mostly due to speculation alone.
If people could pay for *everything* with bitcoins, we'd probably be talking about a price more like $500, or something *much* higher than $30, given that $30 only puts the market cap at about $200 million currently. There's a lot of money out there. One very wealthy person could buy bitcoins and easily raise the price to $30 overnight.
@_date: 2011-09-10 12:42:34


OK, consider how BTC money supply works.
The USD is inflationary because each year more USD are entered into the system.
Bitcoin is deflationary because each year fewer and fewer BTC are entered into the system (until 0 new BTC per year are entered into the system).


Block rewards are already not constant, as they depend on the fees are paid per transaction. A constantly decreasing reward is a concept that I think that some 10 year olds can comprehend, but maybe I have too much faith in people's intelligence. On the other hand, ultimately every bitcoin user is not a miner. We only need a minority of bitcoin users to be miners -- and I think we can expect those users to understand very very basic math.


You're right about that, I think we're in agreement about the distribution phase length -- and perhaps I thought you were responding to me originally, though I see that you were responding to the comment under mine.

It is not "out of our hands". There are ***many*** possible solutions.
We could ask for a short pin (say 8 digits, perhaps entered by mouse with a randomized onscreen keyboard) when sending funds, to prevent random people using your computer from sending money, and then still have a long password that is only entered when loading your wallet, which might happen only once per bitcoin installation for many people. This would greatly increase the chances of a trojan being discovered before it was able to keylog your password.
Since Bitcoin 0.4 forces you to enter your password every time you wish to send coins, people are likely to use a shorter password for convenience, further reducing the security.
Even better would be to support yubikeys (usb device with encryption key stored on it). Maybe a similar bluetooth based device could be used like a yubikey -- perhaps an android app could accomplish this?
The point is that we're far from having a secure wallet with this change, and that there *are* many things that can be done to achieve a high security level.

Wifi encryption has shown multiple times that it's prone to security exploits. Actually, it wasn't the wifi encryption, it was the implementation of it. *We still have Wifi.* We have new wifi encryption implementations.
Similarly, the only bitcoin exploits that I know of are the ability to 51% attack and pump and dump. Google could prevent both of those. They could also create their own cryptocurrency that are less vulnerable -- we know they have enough PhDs under the hood to do it.
That said, I agree with the point that bitcoin is hard to monetize... sort of. They could hold on to their own mined coins, and make a big profit that way. ***One day*** of google revenue (~$65 million) could fund all of the ASICs they'll need for years to be a huge miner.
The biggest reason that Google is not using bitcoin for Google Wallet is that it is not established tech, and ***near field communication + mastercard*** tech is. **That's what Google Wallet is.** It's a way to do exactly what a NFC mastercard does, with your phone. There are currently no bitcoin NFC terminals -- implementing that as google would be a huge undertaking with a ton of associated risk. Mastercard has already done all the work for google, and google is now simply plugging into an existing system.
It's not really fair to compare that to bitcoin, and ask why they didn't do 100x more work to implement this as a bitcoin wallet of some kind.

The amount of pool resources used is less when your hashrate is less.
That is, the slower your machine, the less communication with the pool.
So there might be more overhead for very slow machines (i.e. CPU miners), but the difference is not necessarily large.
You need to check for new work constantly regardless, but you report work back proportionally to your mining speed.
And more importantly, if mining pool fees still cover the difference in resources used, then the mining pool still loses money by banning the CPU miners.
Additionally, most computers have some sort of GPU, and many have ATI GPUs.

Bitcoinica is not a real market.
It is a small pool of coins (like 50BTC) with a market maker bot deciding the price partly based on the real MtGox market price, which trades with MtGox to maintain its small pool of 50 BTC.
In my first use of Bitcoinica, I shorted BTC at 3.30 earlier this week, and the MtGox price (which Bitcoinica is based on) fell to 3.10. I wanted to liquidate my position, but the Bitcoinica price did not fall, because Bitcoinica takes a long while (sometimes) to adjust to the MtGox price. The MtGox price rose, and Bitcoinica finally adjusted to something like 3.20. The spread on bitcoinica is so massive that I still couldn't make a profit at that price, despite a 3% fall!
Bitcoinica has incentive to bet against you, and can set the price so that you don't win, unless someone else using the service places an order that goes in the opposite direction of you.
Bitcoinica is not a real market, and so it does not need us to place a market maker bot there (it is already entirely based on a market maker bot).
Oh and did I mention that Bitcoinica's spreads are huge, and vary considerably? The huge spreads are reason enough not to use that service, even if it followed MtGox prices exactly.

It would have been a 0.24% fee to send $10 using Bitcoins.
To send money from RBC to China costs a flat fee of $13.50 plus ~2% in the exchange rate difference from the market price of USD to CNY.
Western union charges a flat fee plus ~4% in the exchange rate from USD to CNY.
I don't know what the flat fee at Western Union is -- maybe someone can help figure that out. It is probably in the range of ~$10.
So it's clearly cheaper to use bitcoins unless you're sending relatively large sums (thousand of dollars at least).

They may have the ability to compromise the blockchain right now. But it's unlikely that they have actually compromised it already, as we would have noticed this sort of activity.

For this to be true the cost of mining only has to be higher for a large group of people.
Sure, some miners even pay zero for electricity! Their electricity cost of mining a Bitcoin is 0.
But my whole point, which I made in the original (still unedited) post, was that mining power will drop unless the price of BTC rises -- which is true, and your citation of some particular minority of miners having cheaper mining costs did not disprove my point in any way. In fact, stating that there are only a minority of miners have a low bitcoin cost proves my point -- that hash power will drop unless price rises.

The drop in USD/BTC price complicates things in the following way:
Just one month ago, many miners would only need to sell 50% of their coins (or less) to recoup their investment within 1 year, if the price stayed stable.
However, today, for many miners, it's no longer possible to make a profit in one year at the current price, difficulty, hardware and electricity costs -- even if they sell 100% of their mined coins!
So I think that many miners who did not need to sell most of their coins in previous months, didn't sell all of their coins.
We now have a bunch of miners who are holding coins. Selling them now (at a low price) might not make sense to them, so they will hold on to their coins.
There are many factors, but I think that many miners do not want to sell simply due to the psychological factor of not wanting to sell at a much lower price than what their coins were once worth.
A lot of miners might be hanging on to see what happens when the supply drops in half in a few hundred days.

That's not exactly how exchanges work. You can ask any price you want, but that doesn't mean that your order will be filled (someone else has to open an order and choose to sell at that price).
If you ask the current market price, then your order will be filled immediately (because someone else already has an open order at that price).
I'm not familiar with bitcoin-central, but you can usually view open orders, which will show you what the ask prices are, which are the prices that others are willing to sell at.
You should be able to cancel your order at any time if you like, and open an order at a different price.

If you are an exchange, and you use 1 confirm, you are guaranteed to lose money.
But yes, I agree that 6 confirms is generally excessive.
For exchange operators though, 6 confirms does buy time to notice a 51% attack, if that ever does happen (because you'd have two competing chains that are both 4-5 blocks long, and you could automatically suspend deposits until an admin determined what's going on).


They are actually not at all the same. When one person has a lot of hash power, they can double spend at any merchant that they want to if the merchant uses 1 confirmation. Credit card fraud is a different beast entirely -- you have to steal a card, and it has a limit on spending, and often cards are automatically suspended if a transaction is suspicious.
Credit card fraud is not something that you can easily avoid if you want to accept credit cards, but with bitcoin increasing the number of block confirms from 1 to 2 reduces fraud rate by an order of magnitude.

Hah, fair enough. These terms are commonly used by (admittedly amateur) bitcoin traders, so I decided to use them because it makes it a little bit easier to explain what I observed at the mtgoxlive depth chart.
When I say bid wall, I mean a buy order (a bid) that is considerably larger than other bids that are relatively near it. (This begs the questions "how large" and "how near" -- there is no good answer.)
On the depth chart, this looks like a "wall" because the bid depth suddenly jumps vertically at the point where there is a large order (or many orders) at the price where there is a "bid wall" (or "buy wall").
** Look at this chart to see an obvious "bid wall" at 2.20: **
On the NYSE for example, I don't think anyone would bother to discuss a buy wall, regardless of whether you have easy access to a depth chart, because on the modern stock market, bots distribute large purchases among many prices typically, so "walls" don't exist.
It is not a technical term with a strict definition.

I address that partly with the "on average" part. I assume that *eventually* bitcoins will be spent -- for most people there's no point in holding on to bitcoins until you're dead.
I think that was a reasonable assumption.
I actually made a broader assumption than that though. Speculation can change the price at any time for no special reason. Sellers could just decide that the price should be higher or lower -- and the price would destabilize.

Um no.
If it is not profitable *at this point in time* then you can obtain bitcoins for less by simply buying them.
If it is cheaper to buy them *at this point in time* than to mine them, then we know for certain that if you buy them instead of mine them, that your profit will be larger regardless of whatever price they are at when you sell them.


That is terrible logic :(
If you are paying more in electricity to obtain coins than to buy the coins on an exchange, then ***why*** would you not choose to buy the coins instead of mine them!

Notice that **this is the second time that we've seen a significant price rise after a fall to ~$2 in the last 40 days**. You could have made this post the last time and claimed that we were in the slope of enlightenment (and I think that someone did, too).
Maybe this is the slope, maybe not. You have no idea, and you can't tell based on 1 week (or less) of prices rising.

Does it really matter how your employer pays you?
If your employer decided to start paying you in british pounds instead of USD (and suppose you have a bank next to your work that can convert between the two), would you really quit?
What matters is where you can spend your coins.

To save transaction costs.
It would have been a 0.24% fee to send $10 using Bitcoins.
To send money from RBC to China costs a flat fee of $13.50 plus ~2% in the exchange rate difference from the market price of USD to CNY.
Western union charges a flat fee plus ~4% in the exchange rate from USD to CNY.
I don't know what the flat fee at Western Union is -- maybe someone can help figure that out. It is probably in the range of ~$10.
So it's clearly cheaper to use bitcoins unless you're sending relatively large sums (thousand of dollars at least).

Remember that you just finished saying that bitcoin can't work in the *long term*. So this makes it pretty easy to refute what you said.
If you pay for something at a brick and mortar store, the risk is virtually zero to you. E.g. if you are paying your waitress at the bar, what risk is there to you?
MtGox has greatly increased their security, and I generally trust them. Although I will agree with you that there is lots of room for improvement. As far as I understand, no one has ever lost money due to a hack at MtGox -- their site just went down for a few days, and they've since done security auditing, added Yubikeys, etc.
My primary point though was that your criticisms were not specific to bitcoin -- insecure websites will always be hacked. Secure websites won't be.
I'm a software engineer with an economics background, currently working on some fixes to the problems you see. So I agree with you on some points. There are lots of problems right now. It's a new technology, and there aren't a lot of great ways to spend your coins.
However, I completely disagree with your long term view. In the long term, cryptocurrencies will change the world forever.
It took a few years before BitTorrent had robust client software. Today 99% of the torrent links that I use are magnet links -- those didn't even exist when bittorrent came out. Who knows what Bitcoin's "magnet link" tech will be?
We are still using the original Bitcoin client. Like the BitTorrent client, that is just a proof of concept client, written by a clever programmer, but not an expert in human usability.
Are you trying to trade bitcoins directly from one person to another? Don't do that, you will get scammed. How often do you trade your non-bitcoin money person to person over the internet?
If you buy from a company that accepts bitcoins, you are likely relatively safe.
People seem to forget the gravity of bitcoin. It takes a lot to make a financial tool like this mature, but we're getting there.

The electricity cost alone of producing a bitcoin at the current difficulty at $0.10/KWH is about $2.40/BTC.
The electricity cost of producing (mining) a bitcoin if nothing changes is $4.80 in 1.15 years.
Mining electrical cost efficiency is about to drop in half with new AMD cards. This brings the cost of a bitcoin in 1.15 years back to the current $2.40.
These ignore all other costs (miner's time, hardware costs).
Including hardware costs, at about $1000 per 18 months (the hardware efficiency doubling time), **the ongoing mining cost per bitcoin comes out to about $4.25** (STILL not including a mining operators opportunity costs, such as time spent).
If bitcoins are widely adopted then demand increases and the price has to at least exceed the cost.
In that case, the price of bitcoin will be higher than the current $4, since the price is not likely to equal precisely the bare minimum operating cost, with miners operating for free.
Note that many people are buying bitcoins at inflated rates on websites that offer them instantly (and dangerously via credit card).
If people are willing to pay a higher price, this suggests that the exchange prices do not reflect the equilibrium price.
If bitcoins are not widely adopted, then demand may fall and the price goes down.
To answer your question, I am making the assumption that bitcoin adoption will grow.

Bitcoin can easily function at 1/3 the price that it is currently at.

That is exactly what it does.
So you get the same number of bitcoins as when you were mining bitcoins before, but you now also get namecoins.
You cannot test a hash against the bitcoin chain twice to get twice as many bitcoins. Instead, you test the hash against the bitcoin chain once, and then the namecoin chain once, to get both BTC and NMC.

There is an easy way around this.
The merchant software that sets current prices on the fly based on the lowest price of BTC in the last 24 hours, can also automatically sell BTC soon after it was recieved. Exchange sites like Mt.Gox provide APIs for this sort of thing.
Lots of people are buying BTC for USD at any time, and aquiring them to sell at the local business requires buying the BTC -- increasing liquidity. So I don't know what illiquidity problem you're talking about.
Look at the Mt.Gox trade volume charts. There is about 10K in volume on average every day. This will only increase if more businesses start accepting bitcoins.


***Days***? Bitcoins can be transferred to MtGox in ***minutes***. Trades clear in ***seconds***. Withdrawing money from your MtGox USD balance is not subject to the price volatility of BTC, so what does this matter? Withdrawing money from a Paypal account also takes days -- any many businesses accept paypal.

It's value is determined by what people are willing to pay for a Bitcoin. The reason that they were willing to pay so much, is because they were speculating that many merchants would eventually accept bitcoin, and therefore that it would be worth a lot more than $30 in the future.


It sounds like you like namecoin because they have intrinsic value in the sense that they provide the service of maintaining .bit domain names.
This is true but it's not necessary for a currency to have intrinsic value in this sense, especially since if namecoin was used by many merchants, than it's value would be much more closely tied to the cumulative value of all the things that you can buy with namecoin -- much more so than they are tied to the value of .bit domains. In fact, if namecoin were to be suddenly adopted on a massive scale, buying a .bit domain would be extremely expensive, because the price of namecoin would skyrocket, and then namecoin's ability to maintain .bit domains becomes rather silly and namecoin's value would no longer be strongly tied to domain names that cost hundreds of times more to purchase than a .com.
Tying the value of a currency sounds like a good idea, but there can be downsides to this too. For example, if .bit domains suddenly became very popular for some reason, then it could raise the price of namecoin -- we might not want something like the value of a domain name to affect the value of our currency.


Namecoin is a fork of Bitcoin. So if you "merged" bitcoin and namecoin, you would have what namecoin already is right now, essentially.

If you are choosing to limit the coin supply simply because it simplifies (an already pretty simple) calculation, then we've got bigger problems with this currency than whether the supply is finite or not.
E.g. to use your example, in 20 years there will be 1.3 billion TBX. If you have 100 TBX today, then you will hold exactly (100/1300000000)% of the world's TBX in 20 years... does this really need to be any simpler?
@_date: 2011-10-10 10:00:13
By that I assume you mean that there is no graphical namecoin client frontend.
The namecoin client is very similar to the command line bitcoin client (which it is based on).
The thing to remember here is that namecoin is intended for controlling .bit addresses, and it's primary purpose is not to be able to pay your tab at the bar, but instead to be able to register .bit domains. So a pretty client is not really essential here -- though it's likely that one will be developed now that we have merged mining.
This is nice because in some sense, namecoin and bitcoin *complement* each other, instead of compete with one another.

You raise a good point.
The merchant has to ban you individually.
I was thinking that mtgox would ban you since in order to withdraw large amounts from mtgox you need to verify your account by submitting your ID to them.
However, then you just need more IDs.
In order for a double spend attack to be worth it with 10% of the hashpower, you need to make back more than you would by simply mining. So there's little incentive to try to doublespend at say, a coffee shop.
A coffee shop could in fact ban you though from future purchases, if one of your transactions was reversed. So someone else would have to go in and buy your coffee for you, to carry on your double spend attacks, making them more expensive and even less worth it.

Your math assumes 1 Mhash/s per CPU miner (but even a several year old single core netbook processor can go faster than that), and at 1Mhash/s * 50000 should be 1.5 BTC/day for deepbit.
But CPU mining is not *that* much more than the number you quoted (maybe 2-4x more). So fair enough, maybe deepbit is losing money, and maybe a new botnet is not using deepbit (although previous botnets have used deepbit without getting banned).

The value will take a long time to stabilize if the price is continually falling due to lack of new money entering the bitcoin economy.
Increasing the size of the community will promote use, give incentive to new business to start accepting bitcoins, and in the short term inhibit the current downward trend due to new interested bitcoin users buying some coins.
If we keep letting the price fall, and keep the community small, then when a new popular business starts accepting bitcoins, the price will spike much more easily -- the very thing that you seek to prevent right now.
The value of a Bitcoin is likely quite a bit higher than the current price, so if the price falls much lower in the short term, then it's going to spike back up again when its' actual value is realized -- that's not stability.

Correct. I have assumed that miners want to profit and mining cost stays the same.
In reality, eventually mining cost will go down, and some miners might be willing to operate at a small loss.
But I think we can agree that there are miners who *require* profit or they will stop mining, and that mining costs will not suddenly drop just because BTC price did -- mining cost goes down slowly relative to this sudden price drop.

As I said in response to [this article](
It is silly to consider volume in BTC because it is much easier to move higher amounts of BTC when the price is low compared with when the price is high.
This is why you should consider price * volume, which gives your BTC volume a weight. Note that price*volume is just volume in USD!

Actually since the 7870s are probably just a shrinked version of the 6970s (using the new 28nm process), they will probably *not* be insanely priced, especially since they are only running 8% faster than 6970 stock clocks.
The MHash/J ratio will be about twice what you see on a 6970. (They say 120W for 1536 VLIW4 cores.)
The same comparison applies to the 7850s and so on with the previous gen cards. The MHash/USD ratio will be worse than current cards, but probably not *much* worse, and you get twice as good hashrate/J ratio.
The Q1 cards (which are GCN and therefore a different architecture) might be pretty expensive.

**The MtGox fee is 0.25% for people doing this kind of volume.**
My rate for example is 0.29% currently, and I've only traded something like 36K BTC in the past 30 days on MtGox.


- This does not explain the erratic movement of the bid and ask walls placed by this individual.
- This does not explain why he is *buying* lots of bitcoins as well as selling them.


He might be.
However we are not dealing with a blue chip stock here. We are not dealing with professional investors. We are not dealing with market maker bots that have been tested for years by professionals that work for investment firms.
There are a great many possible ways that price manipulation could be making this person money.
Maybe he found a way to exploit some market maker bots. Maybe the behavior of amateur bitcoin speculators is working to his advantage.
For example:
When he placed the $200k bid wall at $2.50, and $20k sell wall at $2.50001, **barely anyone touched his massive bid wall**. Everyone bought up the much smaller $20k sell wall -- and very quickly.
He then moved his bid wall to $2.60, and again, no one wanted to try selling into a $100k wall. On your typical day, we see $10k - 20k bid walls -- so a lot of bitcoin speculators are afraid of trying to move a wall that is 10-20x larger than the walls that they are already afraid of trying to "move".
So many sells occured in the $2.60 - $2.70 range. Who knows how many of those sells were the manipulator at that point, after he potentially bought $20k at $2.50?
The bid/ask depth is very low. He can move a wall, for just $10k to move the price up 15% at the moment that I am writing this. He can then let the volume around the new price (just above his new bid wall) take care of the $10k that he now wants to sell.
TLDR; I don't know if he's profiting or not, but it's pretty clear that someone is manipulating the price.

The price for 1 coin relative to some other currency doesn't really mean anything.
In fact, we could decide to change the bitcoin protocol right now, and multiply everyone's coins by 10, and the price would fall to 1/10th of what it currently is. Or you could do the opposite.
Put another way:
You can buy around 90 Yen with 1 USD, that doesn't make cars from Japan cost 1/90th as much to Americans :)
Put another way:
You can currently buy millions of millibitcoins with 1 pound. We just chose 8 decimal places to be the spot where we have "1 bitcoin" mostly arbitrarily.

I'm not going to tell you to mine or not to mine, but here is something to think about:
2x6770 not overclocked = 380 MHash/sec
Do not seriously overclock them, as you will spend more in electricity costs then you will gain ( since power = voltage^2 ).
Now take into account stales, occasional downtime, and the pool cut, and you're at about 342 Mhash/sec.
This is 6.88 bitcoins per 30 days.
At 4 USD per bitcoin, you will make $27.51 per month.
At $0.10 per kilowatt hour, and assuming you use about 400W total with that setup, it will cost $28.80 per 30 days in electricity costs.
Your net loss per month will be $1.29.
Or if the setup uses 300W total then you make $5.91/month profit.

This "preparation" is also called speculation. This leads to volatility, because many traders may guess the result of this change in reward wrongly, causing prices to be too high or too low, and then these prices need to correct to the actual value.

Credit card transactions can be reversed up to 6 months. The credit card companies do the fraud claim investigations. If they find that bitcoins are involved (which is a product that competes with credit cards by the way), it is up to their discretion to decide whether a credit card was stolen or not.
The credit card companies have little incentive to decide in favor of bitcoin sellers, as doing so would improve the state of bitcoin (one of bitcoins current hurdles to overcome is the difficulty in purchasing coins).

The problems you've outlined in this most recent post are very different from being able to pay for everything with bitcoins without an exchange.
When everything you need to live can be paid for with bitcoins, acceptance of bitcoin would be huge (the number of people using it would be much higher), and then the price would be much higher than $5. Demand for coins would be much higher than it currently is.

The whole point of this thread is to build a useful service for Bitcoin. The service would improve the Bitcoin economy and serve the interests of ex-bitcoin-miners and introduce new people to Bitcoin.
It would provide a service that makes an opportunity out of the low price of Bitcoin and would potentially bring a big service to the table that Bitcoins could be spent on.
@_date: 2011-09-30 00:29:52


That's not how it works.
You take all of the transactions that you want to add to a block, add a nonce to that, and then compute a hash of all of those values. When the hash satisfies the desired property, you have a block.
You don't solve a block first, and then add the transactions that you want after.

That is not a good analog to this problem because we would want to print more USD in that case, which can't be done with bitcoin -- yet we can increase mining capacity while keeping a constant rate of supply.
If buying USD supported printing more USD which cured more cancer, and if you could print more USD without changing the inflation rate (as you can with Bitcoin -- see below) then yes, this would probably increase the price of USD, as there would be more USD buyers.
As you can see, that analogy confuses the issue so I vote that we don't use it.
Many people are currently happy to spend money/time/hardware/electricity to do folding without monetary profit.
If bitcoin mining also did folding, then mining power would increase.
The cost of mining would go up (because difficulty would go up) and people would still mine despite operating at a loss, just like they currently do folding for no direct return on their folding costs. The higher cost of mining would reduce the number of people willing to sell bitcoins at lower prices. 
If buying bitcoins supported folding, which supported curing cancer, then more bitcoins would be purchased. This would stop when folding became useless.

Organizations using 1 or 2 block verification will likely lose some money.
If you have 10% of the hash power:
- You can double spend 10% of the time with a 1 block verification.
- You can double spend 1% of the time with 2 block verification.
- You can double spend 0.1% of the time with 3 block verification.
- You can try to double spend once per 10 minutes on average.
So with 2 block verification, you could use 10% of the hash power on the network to double spend 1% of your transactions.
Note however, that using 10% of the network hash power to double spend 0.1% of the time is likely not at all worth it, assuming that you get banned as soon as one of your transactions is reversed.

The service enforces passwords of a certain difficulty, and informs the user of estimated password brute force resistance.
You can choose a separate password for each BTC address, so each address with a different password will have to be cracked.
Edit: ***You can create a private key from a sentence. *** Which is very secure.


That's true, but this is the case with the normal bitcoin client as well.
At least this service has a visual (click with the mouse) keyboard -- which is slightly better but obviously still loggable.
I think the bigger problem is that users may start to access this site from random computers that may be keylogged.
That said, this could be mitigated by logging in with an Android phone (if you know what keyboard software is installed on stock Android, then you know your Android phone is not being keylogged).
This could also be solved with a Yubikey (like MtGox uses).
It's also a separate key per bitcoin address, unlike with the bitcoin client. So a keylogger can only steal one address at a time.
Overall this is more secure than the standard bitcoin client as far as I can tell so far.

Actually as it's been pointed out many a time, it's clear that a single individual was placing orders that were much larger than any other orders, and then pulling the order.

@_date: 2011-10-17 15:51:45
Actually this doesn't disprove my statement, it proves it instead!
200gh/s is a small minority of the hashpower.
Most people, as you say, are operating at much higher costs than $0.03/KWh.
So as I said, if the price stays this low, hash power will drop, as rational miners will stop mining.
@_date: 2011-10-11 10:13:24
Not true.


It's only enough to get the private keys for the session when the malicious js was used.
That's the same net effect as serving the malicious js constantly if you think about it.
The amount of time spent serving malicious js is proportional to their risk of getting caught.
It is also proportional to the amount of keys they can steal.
If they start serving malicious js say for 1 minute, they get 1 minutes worth of private keys, and they get 1 minute of exposure to anyone who might be running a script that checks to see if their js has changed -- discrediting their site forever.
Whether they have 1000 minutes of malicous js exposure in a row, or 1000 minutes at random times peppered throughout the year does not matter -- either way they will get a small number of private keys, at a great cost.

- A currency that can move us away from the purely Keynesian economic views that many are starting to lose trust in is appealing.
- A currency that can allow *anyone* to start accepting money **easily** for anything, without having to file for a merchant account, and pay money for a merchant account, is appealing.

Again with this BCX stuff. You have no evidence that this is BitcoinExpress. It might be, it might not be. I'm not going to bother defending or attacking him here. (What difference does it make which individual is manipulating the price?)


There is one developer. And no he doesn't. CoinHunter is crazy, and there are a great many problems with SolidCoin.
Solidcoin is a centralized currency with a single point of failure. It completely defeats the idea of a crypto-currency. If you just want a centralized currency, you can choose to use a paypal-like services -- you don't need a cryptocurrency for that.
The big innovation of a cryptocurrency is the solution to the problem "how do we decentralize currency?" Solidcoin has destroyed this innovation.


Well, it's pretty straight forward. There are fewer people willing to buy/sell solidcoin, (and less money in the solidcoin market) so it's easier to buy out solidcoin orders. A lot easier.
Solidcoin prices are set in the free market in the same way that any other currency price is set -- this has nothing to do with the bitcoin protocol or the solidcoin protocol, or the way that USD operates.
The bid/ask depth at BTC-E is ***tiny*** compared to bitcoin depth at MtGox. So you could easily take a small amount of money over to BTC-E and double the price of SolidCoin if you really wanted to.

I keep hearing this silly argument. I don't know why.
The amount that constitutes "one unit" of bitcoins was chosen totally arbitrarily, and has little to do with anything.
You can buy 78 Japanese Yen with 1 US Dollar. Do you think that the Yen will be worth 78 times as much because "it's reasonable" to think that 1 yen should be worth about 1 USD?
One ounce of gold is around $1700 -- note how one ounce is a totally arbitrary denomination (just like 1 bitcoin is) and that $1700 is a lot more than $5.
The price is determined by supply and demand -- not by what perception people have of what the price of some arbitrary denomination of bitcoins should be relative to the US dollar.


Which is why I've been telling people not to hold it, and to use it as a payment system instead.
@_date: 2011-10-24 21:20:56


Actually merchants are slowly adopting it, which is slowly stabilizing the price.
It's not a binary black/white issue -- merchant adoption can be slow instead of *everyone in the world suddenly adopt it right now!* which ironically would destabilize the price during a sudden adoption anyway.


Actually the use of bitcoins for illegal trade is what caused bitcoin to gain a lot of press and drove adoption of bitcoin forward.
I'm not proud that bitcoin is used for illegal purposes (nor am I happy that the USD is used for illegal purposes), but it has helped bitcoin quite a lot, as well as hurting it.

Maybe he's afraid of any criticisms of a bitcoin-based organization.

As I wrote on that forum just now:
This does not do much to explain the common case at Bitcoinica, as he conveniently choose scenarios where Bitcoinica always has a higher balance than the customer's trade, (and the customer uses 1:1 margin).
For example:
If Bitcoinica has a $1000 balance, and the customer executes a $1000 trade at 10:1 margin (which Bitcoinica allows), then bitcoinica does not have the funds available to fully equalize this trade against mtgox. The trade would then require $10000 but bitcoinica only has $1000.  **If that trade is very profitable, Bitcoinica will have to pay the customer his earnings, or prevent him from liquidating his position until it is either not profitable, or until another customer opens an opposing position.**
In all of the scenarios he says "Bitcoinica has lost money! Wrong!".
It is in fact very possible for Bitcoinica to lose money -- the fact that he conveniently avoids this scenario is rather suspect.

Sorry px403, but the way that new business will accept bitcoin is to automatically transfer it to USD upon reciept.
Preaching that you should accept Bitcoin without an intermediate stable currency right now is just begging to expose the problem of Bitcoin's volatility to a prospective new Bitcoin-accepting business. Either they will argue with you about it outright, or they will discover this problem later and discard accepting Bitcoin as a payment method.
Eventually, when many businesses accept bitcoin (and transfer to USD or some other intermediate currency), then avoiding the intermediate currency will happen automatically, because the trade commissions can be avoided and the price will be more stable when liquidity increases due to many businesses adopting this practice.


No, buying what you want to buy is more awesome than buying what you don't want from the other side of the world.
I agree that more businesses should accept Bitcoin, but I think that they should start by using an automatic intermediary currency while the bitcoin price is still uncertain in the short term.

As a tax haven, there is no big mystery:
 * Accept money in bitcoins, and spend the money as bitcoins, and you pay 0% tax, as the government has no record of you ever having this money.
Other reasons to keep your money in bitcoins:
 * Savings account interest often does not beat the inflation rate, so 0% interest in your bitcoin account does not put you worse off than storing dollars in a savings account.
 * Transaction fees of moving dollars around increase the cost of goods and services, so goods/services providers that accept bitcoins can offer you 1-3% cheaper prices if you pay in bitcoins.
Further, you mentioned that bitcoins are less liquid than dollars. That is only true for certain types of transactions. For many transactions, bitcoins are much, much more liquid. You can transfer bitcoins anywhere in minutes for a tiny cost. You cannot transfer $1.00 from a US bank account to someone in Africa in minutes, without losing a large portion of that $1.00 to transaction fees.

Since solidcoin will be shutdown for 2 weeks, it's likely that we'll see most of the solidcoin miners back on bitcoin. This represents a ~1% increase in hash rate on the BTC network -- though who knows how many people are shutting down their rigs due to the price decline.

People who want the price to stay stable are not trying to manipulate the market into making the price stable... They are mostly just ignoring the price of the coin, and trading with bitcoins instead (e.g. Silk Road use).
Right now, these people hold bitcoins for long periods and don't really contribute to short term price changes much.
The instability of the bitcoin price will only come to an end when many merchants start accepting bitcoins. 
When many people accept BTC as payment, it's value will be more closely tied to things with obvious intrinsic value -- and more trade volume will actually start coming from merchants that aren't interested in speculating on the BTC price.

To be clear: I suggested that changes happen more frequently. I did not suggesting that the halving period changes, or that the average rate of block reward decay changes.
The reason that I would like to see this happen, is so that prices are more stable -- in the interest of higher adoption of bitcoin as an actual currency in the long term.
Can you explain why you think that a tiny adjustment to block rewards every week would be worse than a comparatively enormous change in block rewards every 4 years?
@_date: 2011-10-10 23:45:09


By the time you own 0.001 of that worth, you will likely be dead (since it's hundreds of years from now).
It's better to pick a more reasonable time frame like 10-20 years.
If you pick a reasonable time frame for TBX like 10-20 years, you effectively have a similar situation.


The calculation is actually harder with BTC than TBX, unless you pick the 21 million mark after your death.
Knowing what the TBX money supply is at a given year is very easy (it's always +2.63 million per year).
Knowing what the BTC money supply is at a given year -- well, do you know how to figure that out of the top of your head? It's the sum of an exponential.


TBX may actually be a better example of where linear supply can be better, because 2 million of the 7 million premined are being given back with the faucet, and only 1.5 million are supposedly being kept by the creator for development costs over the next 6 years. The rest is for a coin laundering service (which I do not really approve of).
So premining 7 million means that inflation is much more limited on the currency release day.
But alright, we can consider FBX for this theoretical discussion if you prefer.
With FBX, there are 2500 premined coins. So the inflation is extremely high at the start.
In the first 8 hours, the number of FBX doubles.
4 years after FBX comes out:
There will be 10.5 million coins, and each additional block will add **0.0002378%** to the money supply.
4 years after BTC comes out (assuming no premined coins, which there were actually 1 million of):
There will be 11.8 million coins, and each additional block (25 per block now) will add **0.0002116%** to the money supply.
As you can see, inflation is very similar between FBX and BTC after 4 years. At 5 years, BTC inflation is higher than FBX inflation.


I actually think that this is a problem with bitcoin. The halving period can be 4 years, thats fine. But the coin decrease adjustments should be happening much, much more often. Probably they should happen at the same time as the difficulty adjustments -- every 2 weeks.
Anticipating what the price will do years in advance of a halving of supply is very difficult, and creates a more volatile market.

This has been discussed here now and then.
You're mostly right:
In order for the price to *remain stable*, **on average** the amount of USD entering the system must increase proportionate to the amount of bitcoin entering the system. This assumes that no bitcoins are lost (i.e. no one forgets their wallet encryption password).
However, I'm not suggesting that we're printing bitcoins too fast, or that the price actually **should** remain stable.
- The amount of bitcoins produced will drop in half a few hundred days from now (down to 25 coins/block). ***And speculators are adjusting the price in anticipation of this future decrease in supply.***
- The number of coins being sold currently is not necessarily (or likely) equal to the amount coins being mined. Miners are holding on to those coins, and the halving of mining rates, or the increasing of bitcoin demand will make it easier to average out to the rate needed to maintain a relatively stable price. 
@_date: 2011-10-09 12:22:46
Bitcoin models the way that gold works -- there is a finite supply, and gold mining rates decrease on an exponential curve.
I am not strictly against this, but it's still important to see where there is a downside here. (There is also a downside to inflationary currencies as well, but I will only reply to your post.)
Tenebrix for example has a linear supply rate instead -- 25 TBX per block forever.
To use your 20 year number: in 20 years there will be 1.3 billion tenebrix in the wild. At this point, adding 25 TBX to the 1300000000TBX money supply is virtually nothing.
Is your coin generation rate linear, or is it exponential like Bitcoin?
When you have exponential addition of coins in the beggining, not only do the early adopters profit a lot, but they profit ***enormously***. If the supply is a simple line instead, then early adopters still profit, but it's less lopsided.
Both of these systems suffer from the same problems that non-inflationary currencies have (though they both avoid the problems of the fed). Some of the more often mentioned problems are that consumer spending incentive is reduced, and that you can more easily corner the market, because if you hold a large percentage of coins, then no one can do anything about it.
Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Bitcoin supporter, but I suspect that neither the unbounded linear supply TBX model nor the bounded exponential supply BTC model is ideal. There are a great many other ways to modify the rate at which money is injected into the system.
@_date: 2011-10-10 01:42:31
If this is the reason, then I guess that answers my question.
It seems like a pretty small amount of work to point your miner at a different pool though (you don't need any different mining software), in order to get a 1.4 - 2.0x increase in profit.
Hell, you don't even need a namecoin address to get started -- you can always get one later.

I'll give you a very good reason for a business to accept bitcoins:
It gives them a bunch of free customers and publicity.
When a business starts accepting bitcoins (e.g. that electronics store that created a billboard, or that sandwich place), it gets a mention on reddit, newspaper articles, etc.
There are thousands of bitcoin holders looking for someway to spend their bitcoins just for the *cool* factor, or because they *want* bitcoin to succeed, if nothing else.
Bitcoins are not illegal in most places, as far as I know. If they are ruled illegal, just stop accepting them. I'm not suggesting that a business needs to (or should want to) accept bitcoins exclusively.
You can talk about legality, and bitcoin reputation all you want. The reputation will improve as sites like Mt.Gox improve their services and security. The reputation will improve with new bitcoin clients (like 0.4 which has built in wallet encryption). In the end, most businesses will accept bitcoins if it means that they will make more money. And a time is coming when bitcoin is easy and secure enough to use, that businesses stand to gain customers and a higher income by accepting bitcoin.

If everyone suddenly switched to merged mining, the amount of bitcoin hash power would be the same. The amount of namecoin hash power would now be equal to the bitcoin hash power (so around 30 times more than the current namecoin hash rate).
There is probably a small overhead with merged mining as well (since you must check for and submit new work twice, and verify your work twice), let's assume that this overhead is about 1%.
So the difficulty of bitcoin may theoretically drop by 1% as a result of this.

1. This is a good example of how cash is becoming outdated.
2. This is a very interesting example of how a government is willing to spend significant resources on compromising another government's currency -- which is very relevant to the many discussions has seen about what a government might be willing to do to influence Bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-11-18 00:51:57


I don't know if this person is making money.
Whether they are influencing the price and whether they are making money by doing so are two different questions.
- Maybe it's MtGox trying to encourage volatility to increase commissions gained. 
- Maybe there are a bunch of bots that make decisions based on market depth, that he is taking advantage of.
- Maybe he is setting up big positions on other exchanges and moving the price significantly on mtgox so that his orders on other exchanges are filled by those seeking to profit by arbitrage (and then they get burned when the MtGox price moves back while they wait for their bitcoins to transfer between exchanges).
There are lots of possibilities.


Yes, and people decide what price they are willing to buy/sell at based on market depth, and what the current market price is, and what it was in the past.
Yesterday ask depth was so shallow that you could spend $1100 USD to move the price up by 15% on MtGox. So if you bought up 1100 USD and then put up a bid wall of $100k at a price 12% higher than the price before your buys, you may influence speculators by making them avoid selling near the large bid wall. You can then sell at some price above your average cost.
Note that this is just an example of how you might manipulate the price -- this might not be profitable at all, I don't know. The only thing that is pretty clear right now is that someone is greatly influencing the price, and it appears to be intentional.
Also note that when the 2.20 bid wall was removed yesterday, the price fell to 1.99 shortly after. People panic when that safety net is gone.

Yes, but at $2/BTC we might lose something like 30% of miners.

So it's important for the price of bitcoin to stay well above $0.10 for security purposes.

I don't see where they can "add an extra amount" other than the "Fee" box, which is not meant for a tip, that is to prioritize your transaction!

At 10 cents per KHW the electric cost would be about $2.80 for the 1200W that a 3x6990 machine uses. You've also not factored in the difficulty increases, which will affect FPGUs more than GPUs as the ROI time on GPUs is shorter.
You could also have picked a more cost effective GPU miner.
What I'm trying to say, is that the situation for FPGUs with the specs given here are more dire than your posts shows. Future FPGUs or (structured ASICs based on these FPGUs) could change all that of course.

My argument as stated previously stands.
A 3rd party is checking the site. Individual users are not going to be checking the site. It makes no difference if you deliver the bad js on the 1st or 100th time. The 3rd party checker does not know about how often some user has logged in, it would just check the site at random intervals constantly.
If you have a big deposit to make, then you go check "strongcoinchecker.com" or whatever website, or you have a look at the bitcoin forums, or and see if there's news of suspicious activity. If there isn't, then you deposit.
Everyone seems to also be completely missing the point that the fact that this ***could*** happen, and that if they did try to use malicious js to screw a minority of their users, then they would lose all their users -- all their business -- and lose more overall than continuing business. This fact will completely deter them from doing this -- since it is not to their advantage.


That in itself, would be a warning sign not to use this site.
If that happens, then we'll talk at that time. It would be incredibly dumb to do this, since it would drive away a lot of users, and drive away almost all users who would consider putting a large sum in addresses maintained by this site.

I suggest that when talking about the transactions fees, you state that they are tiny. Then you can mention that you can choose not to pay any fees if you don't mind waiting a little longer for your transaction to complete.
The reason I say this is that the official bitcoin client by default charges 0.0005 per transaction, and that transaction fees ultimately should be thought of as being needed (because in ~10 years they may be the primary incentive for miners). A new user might send some coins and then feel betrayed when the client tells the user that a fee will be included (even if it's a very small fee).
You could give an example of fees in a couple of different currencies, including the actual bitcoin costs -- to make it clear to new users just how small the fees are compared to debit/credit/paypal.

Economics for over 100 years has told us that supply/demand sets price.
You are essentially arguing that human emotion will prevent the price from going over $5. I'm telling you that this is just not how prices are set in the long run.
It doesn't really matter if people don't "think" that the price should go over $5. If people want bitcoins, and the price is $5, then they will buy them, and the price will go higher.
What you are saying is that if people want bitcoins, and the price is $5, then they simply wont buy them -- even if they want to use bitcoins to send money somewhere. You're saying that they will look at the $5 price, and say to themselves, "oh, that price is too high, I'm going to stop using bitcoins now" -- even though the price doesn't even affect them if they're just using it as a payment system.
If bitcoins become widespread, the price will go way higher than $5. Way higher. As in, at least an order of magnitude higher. $5 is not even close.


The price of bitcoin is $3 with very few people using it. What happens when thousands of times more people buy it than the current number of users? There's your counterexample. Also theres the whole hundreds of years of economic theory thing.
People will simply adjust their view of the value of things that they buy with bitcoins. If a car cost 5000 BTC before, today a car might cost 500 BTC. Remember that we've seen this before, in the opposite direction. Cars used to cost $5000. Now they cost $50,000. Why do you think that this works for a decreasing unit of currency value, but not an increasing one?
If bitcoin is being used as a payment system, then the cost of things stays the same in terms of US dollars, and the price of bitcoin is probably not given much thought at all by most people using it in that case.

Finding a moving average is trivially easy. A few hours of coding by one person.
For Amazon implementing this payment system would be very easy, they have lots of software developers on their payroll.


Moonco.in's source code is open, you can have a look at what they did. The bitcoin client source is also open, and you are free to build a client in any way that you see fit. *You don't have to do anything through the official bitcoin client.*
That said, let's say its hard for smaller businesses to implement a robust bitcoin checkout. When there is an open source merchant checkout solution that finds a moving average from MtGox, and automatically exchanges the bitcoins to USD, then this will become a non-issue. And this is not a big hurdle!
Amazon or other companies don't need new *infrastructure* to support this -- it's just a small piece of software running on the servers that run the checkout system.


I'd like to point out that this is exactly what I have to do in order to make a payment with Paypal (as I only have a bank account linked to paypal, and not a credit card). That is, I have to deposit to paypal (takes 3-8 business days) and then spend money in my paypal account.
One added value is low fees. Another is speedy transactions. Have you ever accepted a check from someone, or written a check to someone? Imagine how much better/easier that would be with bitcoins.


Do you really think so? For me it's currently easier to use than Paypal. It's only going to get easier to use.
I recently accepted a check for some contract work that I did. It took 5 business days (6 actual days) for the check to clear -- it would have been minutes with bitcoin.
Bitcoins can be just as easy to use as USD, with the added benefit of low fees and much faster transfer times in some cases.
Bitcoins can provide a way to transfer money between non merchants easily and cheaply. To accept bitcoin you don't need to interface with a Paypal like API, you don't need to make an agreement with a bank, you don't need to pay a credit card company. You just need to give someone your bitcoin address, in the form of a short string of text, or a QR code.
Consider these non-merchant transactions:
- developers accepting donations for their software projects that you use
- creative types like musicians or game developers accepting micro payments instead of having to work with a big company that distributes their work
- paying a friend for your share of the bar tab (I can't count how many times the bill has come and 3 people want to split a bill using debit/credit cards -- it would be a little easier if one person paid with credit and the others just sent the appropriate bitcoins).
Also a lot of people like the idea of being able to buy things anonymously if they want to. That may not have a practical purpose most of the time, but that doesn't mean that a lot of people don't like the idea anyway. (I.e. many people who aren't directly affected by the patriot act still don't like the idea of even the possibility of being wiretapped.)

Sigh, *again*, I'm not trying to solve the problem you describe. I'm trying to lessen the impact of the sudden change due to setting block rewards so far apart. My point is that this is an easy problem to solve, and to me seems like a no brainer (although I have the benefit of hindsight), so I'm surprised that they chose such a long period between adjustments.
Whether the halving period should be extended, or whether block rewards should decrease linearly instead of logarithmically, is a different discussion.
By your own argument earlier, we can't know with certainty in advance how fast the bitcoin economy will grow.
When the bitcoin economy is growing faster than the rate of bitcoin mining, then the bitcoin economy overall is ***deflationary***. When bitcoin takes off, this will be the case. This is something that Kruger pointed out and has been discussed at great length in so I will not rehash this here.

MtGox is a good example, because they report to the authorities.
The authorities can easily trace your bitcoins back to MtGox, and then ask MtGox who you are (and MtGox requires you to submit multiple forms of identification if you want to withdraw large amounts of coins, so they know who you are).
So no, simply using MtGox would not be sufficient at all.

My whole point was that if you want to see your average business start accepting Bitcoins ***today***, they need to be able to have the option to automatically transfer to their Bitcoins to USD or you're asking the business to expose themselves to a lot of risk that they may not want. They'll stop doing this eventually all by themselves because it will be more profitable to *not* transfer to USD at some point -- just not today.

You don't need to understand the details of the bitcoin supply math in order to understand the following:
Bitcoin supply is currently fixed at 50 coins per 10 minutes. When more miners join in, the supply is still 50 coins per 10 minutes -- each miner gets fewer coins.
So the statement "*thus devalue the hell out of [bitcoins]*" doesn't make sense, because more miners doesn't increase bitcoin supply.


Bitcoin price was in a bubble, and the price after the bubble was constantly falling, so if you pick anything that has constantly been increasing, you might at first glance think that there is a correlation.
Show me the chart you were thinking of, because mining difficulty has been consistently dropping over the past few months -- which tells us that total mining power has been decreasing (mining difficulty changes as a direct result of mining power).
In other words, I don't know what chart you're looking at, but it's the opposite of what you've said. Mining difficulty has been falling with price, as mining becomes less and less profitable as the price falls.
Here is a chart:
The red line shows mining difficulty. When difficulty is lower, it means there is less total mining power.
As you can see, the difficulty (and therefore mining power) goes down in response to price going down.

After the first verification of the code, any modifications of the code would be noticed immediately by checking the JS against a checksum hash. And then you do a diff, and see what he's done. If he's constantly changing the code, then we stop trusting the site.

More likely miners would pop up in places where electricity is cheapest. In those places, coal power is not used.
IIRC the transaction fees collected by American Express is $0.6 billion/year from that one company alone.
If we could cut the transaction fees from 2% to 1%, we'd already save billions worldwide compared to current costs.
If it got that big, we'd see ASICs that cut the mining cost considerably, but even if we didn't, it would still be cheaper than what we currently do.

1. Yes. 
2. No one can tell you what the future value of bitcoins will be for certain, or what future hardware will do to mining difficulty. In my opinion, you should not invest in mining hardware right now. If you are asking these questions, then don't even think about mining until you have done a fair bit of research, and can make a good guess about what you think the value of bitcoins will be, and how things like FPGAs will affect future mining. If what you are most interested in is mining, then you should visit 3. The most important thing for a beginner is to learn how to protect your wallet. In the next revision of the bitcoin client, this will be very easy and automatic. Right now, you need to manually encrypt your wallet.dat file.
4. Your wallet is stored on your computer in the wallet.dat file. In the future you may be able to store a small spending wallet in a "bank", but right now I can't advise this.
For other questions consider:

It's a sensationalist post. However, this is a much larger than average movement for one day, so I think that it's post worthy.

As has already been said, you are giving the government too much credit. Consider that Silk Road continues to operate, despite efforts of the US federal government working to find those responsible for the site. While Silk Road ***may*** *eventually* be shut down (it will be a good test of Tor's strength as well as the Silk Road operators), finding Satoshi would be much more difficult than this task.

You've misunderstood my proposal.
I am not proposing a new currency, I am proposing a new service (a merchant) that accepts bitcoins. This service is similar to a mining pool.
You cannot do arbitrary computation to secure the bitcoin network.
What we *can* do though, is build a cloud computing service (like ones already in existence, Amazon EC2 for example), and have it accept bitcoins, and advertise it to miners.
This answers the market need of miners to do something profitable with the mining equipment that they have already invested in -- instead of just selling their machine or leaving it sitting in a corner somewhere.
To back the value of bitcoin, we need more merchants. This is an example of one such possible merchant.

Can someone explain this to me?
Why does it say ROI: 49%?
Does he mean ROI: -1%?

I think that it's um, just a joke :)

Ah I see.

My bank supports sending a wire transfer to a mafia kingpin also.

Yes but the companies listed that no longer accept funds for Wikileaks are probably where 90% of their funds came from.

A website holding bitcoin being hacked is not the same thing as the Bitcoin protocol being hacked.
To say that Bitcoin won't work long term because websites that held bitcoin were hacked, is like saying that the US Dollar wont work long term because banks perform transactions online, and they hold USD.
In fact, since we have seen that [online] banks holding USD are virtually impenetrable, this completely disproves your idea that bitcoin cant work long term because websites holding your money will be hacked.

Well it's what I said in the unedited post that you responded to with "WRONG. Categorically Wrong."
Direct quote from my post:
" *Either the price goes up, or the hash power drops significantly.* "
So if the price does not go up, then the hash power must drop.


Again, this doesn't contradict what I've said. Sure, there are people out there making money mining at $2.40/BTC. But ***most people do not make money mining at $2.40***. So the average cost of mining is currently above $2.40. Thus if the price does not increase, hash power must drop. (At least until the cost of mining goes down, which won't be for a while.)


4 people downvoted you, and I wasn't one of them. I usually upvote for contribution, but in this case I'm going to stay neutral because of the tone of your response (full caps "WRONG", etc) in combination with how far off the mark you are :/

1. No conspiracy is mentioned here. In fact, he explicitly suggests that this is a single person's bot.
2. No one said anything about a large amount of money. For all we know, it only requires a few hundred dollars total account value to paint the chart with these small distance trades.
