A deflationary store of value as a currency leads to hoarding and accumulation, and I'm sure there's plenty of parables on the issue of accumulation and how it leads to a few able people treating plenty of peasants like shit.
This is where ''libertarians'' act all surprised and claim they don't understand what I just said in an attempt to 1. oneup me and 2. enable their own kind of violence.
''Libertarians'' and conservatives are extremely similar-- the only difference is conservatives think they'll get better electoral results by emphasizing morality- well, propriety-- while ''libertarians'' emphases accumulation. But ''morality'' and accumulation are the same thing, and the only reason their mutual masturbation goes unchecked in america (the only country where ''libertarianism'' means the far right whereas in the rest of the world it means the far left) is because McCarthy got rid of the far left 60 years ago. It's the liberals that are vastly different to both conservatives and ''libertarians''.

This rhetoric exists in america- the only country where libertarianism means the far right whereas in the rest of the world it means the far left- because 50s mccarthyism got rid of the far left and only allowed the far right to remain.
Small business, small banks, an example of this would be the recent ferguson shooting, where its ok to shoot someone in the back because he's black, and then an embarassing chain of events is set off where a fake head scan of the cop's fake eye injury spreads through twitter, or cash was indeed left at the registry of the shop by the black man...

Bitcoin is like cash, not like a bank. This is why private exchanges between bitcoin and currencies should be exempt from ID, logging and NSA spying. What's so hard to understand about this? What essentially Lawsky is saying here, is that we should attach GoPro to our physical bodies?
All of the ID regulations that central bankers have been trying to extent to other countries, like the Bank Secrecy Act, only have their jurisdictions over banks because they are in fact banks.

Will the IRS be defining that, too, as property, only to have good old Lawsky redefine it as a stock under the jurisdiction of a version of the SEC he's pulled out of his god-given ass? What's the problem, did he spend a year sneering at anyone who thought it was a store of value talking to himself 'haha just you wait...I hate gold, and because I am God, even though I can't get rid of material gold, it is decided that it is forbidden in the symbolic world muahaha'. I'm really impressed at how you americans aren't allowed to have bitcoin, only spend it, and the only way you're allowed to 'have' bitcoin is through the Winklevosses shitty waspy creepy ETF.

Rubbish. ''Libertarians'' are the Alex Jones section of the Glenn Beck party. They are in favour of all forms of violence that defend or attack in the name of property rights. They have also realized that saying they're in favour of certain types of violence isn't good propaganda and so in order to enable their ''third way'' fascism they speak with this soppy doublespeak.
They'll never achieve their goals in a world where 1 vote counts for 1 vote, far from their ideal where only property owners can vote, because money leads people to treat others like shit, which creates a balloonish kind of effects that hits back on them each time there are elections.
Besides, who's saying they're not achieving their goals. Most of the taxes go to whatever system is needed to sustain property rights, like prisons, military or police

Regulations are extended to businesses, not to private individuals. You don't just get to redefine the meaning of an individual like that.
Also, if it weren't bad enough that the general population is now suddenly under the jurisdiction of bank secrecy law, this pertains to any piece of code that acts as escrow, like localbitcoins or blockchain.info, or very possibly nodes and miners themselves. Under the pretense of protecting its users oddly enough its asking for ID and proof of address of the users themselves.
There is also talk of how this ''regulation'' is also forcing coinbase to know all the IDs of people sending bitcoins to you, even though merchants had been ''magnanimously'' exempt.

And what laws of the land say selling cryptography at a bitcoin square requires proof of address? Yeah, that's right, you're shoving them out of your ass. Cryptography isn't digital at all as it can be sold in person, it's physical and symbolic, not digital.

What kind of a moronic answer is that? You think you're correcting me somewhere, that I've got a definition wrong over at dictionary.com?
Entrapment is pretty much legal in the U.S. because unlike in plenty other countries, U.S. police can go undercover, whereas in other countries police can only spy.
Now, when you can go undercover you can suggest, lure and trap a guy into doing crime and then you can make laws that forget that you did the luring, more so if you have a monetary incentive to do the trapping.
For example, a bitcoin seller is ''caught laundering drugs'' because the undercover police cop says he's buying drugs with the bitcoin he buys off him, and the law courts and the police, being as they are for-profit in the US, conveniently forget that if someone says that in real life you don't oppose them, you say yeah whatever, because they could be organised crime and bop you off or something if you showed an anti-crime stance.
That is why we still to this day don't know if Ross Ullbricht did order those murders (or if it was the police) because under the weird notion that the state no longer pursues murder if there are drugs involved, he still hasn't been charged with the murders.
The boundaries get very itchy when you let cops go about the place suggesting crime to other people. Like in the movie American Hustle!

“Stay away from it. It’s a mirage, basically. … It’s a method of transmitting money. It’s a very effective way of transmitting money and you can do it anonymously and all that. A check is a way of transmitting money, too. Are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money? Are money orders? You can transmit money by money orders. People do it. I hope Bitcoin becomes a better way of doing it, but you can replicate it a bunch of different ways and it will be. The idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view.”

Look, this voluntaryism bullshit is because of the modernisms in the 20th century, the counterculture, seeing leftists claim they were for freedom and against government, ghandi going on about how he was against violence, bla bla bla, led the right wing to have to make the claim that it, too, was against violence.
Violence happens everyday in that paradise of landowners you dream of, and whenever a tenant doesn't pay his rent, they send the police over, whenever he falls asleep on the subway they send the police over. There are two reasons why there's a police state in the USA, one is because taxmen and politicians want to feel cozy, and the other is because property rights have to be defended with martial law.

In order to use LR currency, a user first had to open an account through the LIBERTY RESERVE website and provide basic identifying information. Unlike traditional banks or legitimate online processors, LIBERTY RESERVE did not require users to validate their identities. Users routinely established accounts under false names, including such blatantly criminal names as “Russia Hackers” and “Hacker Account.” As part of the investigation, a law enforcement agent opened and executed transactions through an undercover account at LIBERTY RESERVE in the name of “Joe Bogus” and the address “123 Fake Main Street” in “Completely Made Up City, New York.”

Wasn't it the government that provoked Ross, had the user, who had previously helped with the site, go nuts and for no reason at all become a troll and go around threatening with landing all silk road users in jail (probably life sentences) by revealing the site, then suggested to Ross he hire a hitman who was already suggesting to Ross that this was the solution while he too was an undercover cop?
So how many cops were suggesting to Ross that he hire a hitman, let alone encouraging him, and provoking him by making a previous site helper into a sudden psycho troll, and then actually carrying out the murder themselves? Not quite perfect evidence

2011-12 were years full of fear. Things were so bad btc users didn't even know if btc was illegal, and the users were ecstatic when it was labelled as a property and not as, say, Liberty Reserve, or Liberty Dollar. No, there were no US exchanges at the time, because of the massive penalties and costs of being a money transmitter, which is why it all went to MtGox. Besides, even foreign exchanges were accused of needing a transmitter license, but the general idea seems to have been that FinCen would have found it too costly to sue and imprison out-of-country exchanges and they only did so with LR when it got big and after a long time.
By ''regulating itself'', all I mean is paypal/credit card/bank users aren't used to making sure paypal is solvent. They are, however, used to delegating this task to the government, and in the process costing them a ton of fees and taxes, through monopoly and surveillance. Then there are theories, like fractional reserve or inflation of fiat, that go on about how those costs are even higher because the banks have less money in them than everyone thinks they do.

Well I don't think multisig is exempt, right? So really what the bitlicense does is it says it wants the entire online world to be paypal, no difference. There's now fuck all of a difference between paypal and bitcoin, except maybe inflation of fiat but whatever is lost there is gained by killing off the cash-like nature of the virtual world.
And you know full well that the only reason so many people flocked to MtGox was because regulatory pressure pushed all the funds to so few exchanges and because the money coming in was from a world used to paypal and without experience regulating itself.
A good example of self-regulation was Liberty Reserve. No complaints from its users, and NY had to label all the funds criminal and stole all its users funds. But the money in MtGox came from a userbase that was more than used to credit card fees and taxes.

It's no surprise right wingers are fond of ''God'' as ''God'' is a sadistic creep who enjoys suffering of others and then layering sophistry after layer of sophistry to blame all that suffering on the ''Devil''.
That is, of course, when ''God'' is that of a dominant institutionalized religion that through centuries and centuries of marriage with the state invents a theological symbolic order that mirrors the desires of the powerful, those that have property, over those that don't have property for the tiny ridiculous reason that such a religion will be also vested in protecting its own private property.

in other words, gold is still backing ur fiats only it's doing so these days in the form of oil, when that runs out you can return to gold directly

What utter nonsense. Colonialism is a product of pure capitalism. Inflation happens when the peasants storm the bastille and decapitate Marie Antoinette.
You want proof? In 2 minutes you're going to be whining about how all these welfare mothers and entitled lazy people aren't working at Walmart. Capital is always complaining about lazy entitled people while it paradoxically claims to talk about freedom and liberty. Capital wants them all to be in a Bangladeshi sweat shop, which is why it shares so much with puritan reconstructionism.
