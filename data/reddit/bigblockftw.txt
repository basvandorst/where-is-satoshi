Sure, I'm sure there are several factors.
If you look at  you can see the average fee shot up after the 18th. There have been high(ish) fees for a while, but the problem really increased in the last few days.
I can imagine a lot of new buyers who bought the news and don't really understand bitcoin could have seen these fees and been very put off, then when the price started falling, decided to sell off too.

I don't think I completely buy that. I can't see how a few whales could cause this  all by themselves.
Like you said before, I'm sure that's a part of it, in combination with other factors. I'm sure Charlie Lee stating he's dumping didn't help too.

No need for profanity, sir. If I'm wrong, show me where I'm in error.

Why is it laughable?

18 months?

Are you joking? USD doesn't fluctuate like this against any other currency.

True, but it didn't have a completely choked mempool and sky high transaction fees the previous times.

The mempool is 300mb by default, but the operator can make this larger if they want. I have a node with a 1GB mempool, and it's currently using 734MB.
You can see on [this graph]( that the mempool started overflowing on Dec 7th.

There's been over 200,000 pending transactions in the mempool since the 19th, you can check it here

Most of my transactions are to and from exchanges who don't support segwit, it is therefore currently unusable for me unless I want to hop between a regular wallet all the time, defeating the purpose.

Their reasoning is that BCH is closer to the original specification, and therefore it should be called bitcoin. This may or may not have merit as an argument, but repeating it over and over as fact, in a sub with the ticker symbol of the REAL bitcoin is disingenuous.
