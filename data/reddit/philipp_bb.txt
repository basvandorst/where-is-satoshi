One question I am having is, are there really good and simple instant payments apps out there for bitcoin?

Thanks for your quick response. Do you have experience with shakepay or bitbucks?

Speaking of “don’t HODL” ...

We both use it, because we know how it works. Yet, do you think the way lightning is structured today, it's suitable for i.e. retail? I don't think so. I believe it's not user-friendly enough - too complicated than that it could really be used by everyone in the world. But if Bitcoin really is to be recognized as a global payment method at some point, everyone must be able to use it for simple and instant payments.
Right now, Lightning is unable to meet this challenge, I think.

Imagine a monoploy game with bitcoin...when there is 21 Million bitcoin in circulation, the game could take a while

And now we have to make sure, that everyone starts to pay with bitcoin. Damn, wouldn't it be nice...

Bitcoin? Yeah looks like it. Other Cryptocurrencies? I seriously doubt it. For some like Etherum it's too soon to say

Nice! Hopefully there are Cafes, Bars and Restaurants to come.

But, the BTC Empire will strike back

Ladies and Gentlemen, hodl and spendl - pay with bitcoin!

No, i don'T think so.  
No doubt there are reasons for the problems at Lightning and I am far from writing off the Network. But, with regard to the integration of Bitcoin, the whole thing is of course a bitter setback. There are currently alternatives to Lightning which are not so decentralized - i.e. custodial wallets - but which work much more securely, easily and offer payments as fast as the LN.
Maybe you have to say goodbye to a "perfect", "decentralized" and "instant pament" solution for Bitcoin and cut back on some of these points.
