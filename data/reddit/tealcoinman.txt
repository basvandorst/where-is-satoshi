Usually articles that are linked on are usually fine, but roasted over a slight inaccuracy in a minor detail and I defend the article.
But jebus, this was just pure salt for no reason.  I'd wager that the author got drunk and did a few lines of coke before pounding out this article in just under 15 minutes.

Not responding to you specifically, but I do find it funny how many Americans I know have this specific plan in case of disaster, but are also strongly against anyone coming to America when *their* country goes to shit.  They don't see the hypocrisy.

At the end of the day, I'm just happy to ~smug~ over how no one gives a crap about the first wave scamcoins like litecoin, dogecoin, and mastercoin anymore.  
Right now I just see Ethereum's price doing what the same as the first wave scamcoins: Lag behind BTC's price and, when BTC stabilizes or drops, the new coin rises as people try to keep makin' fiat.  
Ethereum may actually be different enough from BTC to survive where as the other scamcoins were just sad ripoffs, but I still won't bet on it.

1 BTC = 1 Moon
As in, you could literally buy SpaceX, fund research and the first colonization efforts in order to establish a separate political entity of a sovereign moon civilization.

But the Trump administration is anti-net neutrality and is open to heavier online surveillance...
but who care?! The libtards lost! That's worth more than a 1000BTC!
So, turns out that a lot of Bitcoiners don't even know what net neutrality is. Interesting.

I've seen YTcracker a couple times live and it's interesting to try and figure out how much of his persona is character and how much is real.

Remember though, the unit of gold is purely arbitrary as much as 1 "whole" bitcoin is arbitrary.  While there may be some psychological victory to be had here, 1 BTC to 1 ounce of gold really means nothing.
