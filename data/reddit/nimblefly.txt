This guy should be THE spokesperson for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-27 04:13:34
That doesn't surprise me at all.  Not enough people know about it and not enough vendors support it.
Keep accepting it though and promoting it.  Good job.
@_date: 2013-11-02 15:40:09
Your are confusing promotional material about him with reality.  
Google "Warren Buffet crook" and you can see plenty of real world examples.
@_date: 2013-11-02 15:23:43
Your comment is the one that stinks of the manure pile my friend. 
The ultra rich, stay that way NOT through honest investment but through loans given to them under any old business name.  I've seen it.  I have friends that do it.  It's THE thing to do when there are no real consequences to a business failing.  That's the nature of things when banks create money out of thin air.  Call your buddy up at Chase, have him give your new company a loan, when it fails, the company files for bankruptcy and the only people to lose out are the citizens whose money is that much more devalued because  new money was printed.

What 10% transaction fee on coinbase?
@_date: 2013-10-31 03:50:46
I absolutely agree with this.  However, one should not be able to rest on one's laurels indefinitely by dishonest means or extreme advantages bestowed through wealth.
@_date: 2013-10-31 06:08:14
Once you have extreme wealth, you should not be able to use that wealth to lobby to have laws written to sustain that wealth, you should not be able to buy preferred stock while everyone else gets common shares, you should not be able to get loans from cohorts at banks that are out of the realm of your smaller competitors simply because of connections.
As far as the tax codes go, hell yes they are absolutely corrupt and wrong.  It is of NO use for people without millions upon millions of dollars to try to change  this because laws simply don't work like that.  Legislation is written by lawyers of wealthy lobbyists and put in place by puppet politicians that are basically bribed for campaign donations.
If you think this is untrue, you have blinders on.
@_date: 2013-10-20 23:01:10
Agreed.  Bitcoin has a HUGE lead also.  Bitcoin has the option to just take ideas any alt might have and cannibalize it for  itself.
In the future, I can see Bitcoin being worth millions a piece, Litecoin being worth 100k a piece and the others on down the line.  
@_date: 2013-10-20 23:18:03
It's not a matter of which ones.  In general, I don't think it's good for bitcoin adoption to denigrate altcoins.  I think it's hard to do this without denigrating bitcoin itself.  
Bitcoin will clearly always be the leader.  Bitcoin is like the US dollar.  It is the world's reserve currency in the crypto marketplace.
I could be wrong, but this is how I see it.
@_date: 2013-10-21 05:01:39
Thank you.
@_date: 2013-10-21 05:01:32
No, I really wanted what I asked for.
@_date: 2013-10-22 06:08:58
That is if you're doing it for your own business.  If you are converting to fiat for someone else it does.
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:09:51
I hear what you're saying though.  It does need to be easier in my opinion.
I think we need to fight the immoral "Money Transmitter" laws that are only meant to maintain a monopoly.
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:13:00
These laws are clearly only meant to maintain a monopoly in the business of currency production and trade.
@_date: 2013-10-31 03:51:59
I'll give you an example.  One of Warren Buffet's friends called Bitcoin rat poison.  
I believe it is rat poison if you are a rat.
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:37:32
Guaranteed they'll know about it quite soon.
@_date: 2013-11-02 15:58:57
You're confusing promotional material about him with reality.  Google "Warren Buffet crook" to see the real nature of the man.
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:15:18
I'm not really a trader.  You may have a point.
@_date: 2013-10-21 17:46:26
Zero...Butterfly Labs never shipped the bulbs.
@_date: 2013-11-01 21:25:00
Bought and sold from them many, many, many times with NO problems EVER.
It sounds like you're a fucking liar or a scammer.  If not, contact their support and stop fucking whining like a bitch.  They are hands down THE BEST.
@_date: 2013-10-22 06:07:05
Accepting bitcoins and converting to fiat DOES NOT make you a money transmitter.
@_date: 2013-11-02 23:54:34
I've explained it already.  The ultra rich get loans out of the realm of anyone else--loans they don't even have to pay back with bankruptcy protection.
These loans are not even real money.  It's good to be the king and create money out of thin air, give it to your buddies and if the project doesn't work out, neither of you have no consequences.
@_date: 2013-11-01 03:58:59
Another brainwashed idiot.  If you think Reaganomics or Keynesian theories are correct you're a dolt.  
I AM wealthy.  Am I in the 2 percent, hell no.  Most 2 percenters were born into wealth and have family money going back generations.  I worked my ass off for mine.
Reaganomics and Keynesian theory both involve individuals at the top, bestowing their magical money upon the hard working masses.  With Keynesian, the govt. borrows money from the elite central banks and you spend your way to the top.  Guess who must repay that money.  With Reaganomics, the elite make it rain on you in exchange for your being their bitch in some way which in itself is not bad but it begs the question, "What the fuck service are they providing to maintain that money?"  In a bitcoin reality they would HAVE to provide a service to mankind to maintain that wealth.  In this central bank world, they just borrow money from their friend over at Chase, both of them get a huge cut and if whatever effort they go after fails, that business just files for bankruptcy and they wash and repeat the cycle.
If you don't see this then you just aren't looking.
@_date: 2013-10-24 18:55:41
At least there weren't any 1/2 members or 1/4 members.  
Things could get pretty messy.
@_date: 2013-10-20 23:37:28
You are in the mood to argue and get points from popular sentiment.  
My points are clear and accurate.  We'll see how it shakes out in a few years.
I would just suggest to you that folks sound insane when they endorse bitcoin so vigorously and disparage other coins.  There is an innate flaw in that thinking that people immediately see.
@_date: 2013-11-02 23:56:41
So the loans he got and never had to repay thanks to bailouts didn't effect us?  Who gave him the money? 
You need to find another hero.  Like I said, look up "Warren Buffet crook".
@_date: 2013-10-20 23:39:59
They damn sure are at least good as a testing ground.  You get to see what mistakes NOT to make.
@_date: 2013-10-21 05:01:21
Thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-02 14:55:35
Evil always has a seductive tongue.  Make no mistake about it.  Buffet and his cronies want the system to stay exactly as it is.
One of his good buddies called bitcoin rat poison.  It is rat poison if you're a rat.
@_date: 2013-10-22 06:11:37
The bitcoins are IN the banana stand.
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:03:44
They already are.  That's what Ripple is. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 15:42:20
The current system rewards lying and stealing and NOT working and saving.
@_date: 2013-10-21 05:38:14
Thanks.  I just buy my stuff from coinbase.  I just wanted to keep up with the price--accurately.  It seems bitcoin.clarkmoody.com is pretty high.
@_date: 2013-10-22 06:08:14
It is as easy as opening a kiosk on the beach...that accepts bitcoins for payment.
Now the remittance part is another deal altogether.  If hotdog stands around New York want to accept bitcoin, they can all day.
@_date: 2013-10-20 23:52:00
I don't care about upvotes.  I want my bitcoins to be worth millions.  :)
I TRULY feel this general attitude holds bitcoin back some.  
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:36:49
Good idea!
@_date: 2013-10-21 00:17:23
I've had people tell me this.  I tell them go ahead.  Good luck getting it marketed and accepted by the mainstream.
@_date: 2013-10-20 23:43:03
You're right.  We should also stick to the US dollar and not look at bitcoin.   Bitcoin is like the homeless person giving some guy that just gave him 100 bucks financial advice.
Do you see the absurdity and parallels in this statement?
@_date: 2013-10-27 04:11:03
Once again huh?
Crashes occur when people get overly optimistic before the spread of bitcoin can support that optimism.
I'd say folks new to bitcoin cause a lot of the crashing.  
@_date: 2013-11-01 12:49:43
Can you comprehend what you read?  I don't know too many liberals that trash Keynesian theory.
I suggest you stop trying to box people in neat little containers so you don't have to modify your understanding of the world.
@_date: 2013-11-02 04:03:55
Translation, even the ultra, pre-established rich will have to actually work for their money instead of steal it like Warren Buffet and his chums.
@_date: 2013-10-20 23:30:29
I think it's unfounded fear honestly.  Once you make an investment, you want it to pan out.   
Bitcoin has a HUGE lead.  For instance, bitcoin will replace Western Union.  It won't be Litecoin.  
I think folks worry that bitcoin may not be able to stand up to competition from altcoins--which is absurd.
I own Bitcoin and a few alts.  There is no way in hell I'd trade my bitcoins for the alts.  The infrastructure behind Bitcoin is exploding.
@_date: 2013-11-02 06:07:58
Anything can be an investment.  The only thing that varies is the risk.
@_date: 2013-10-20 23:38:37
I agree.
@_date: 2013-10-31 06:15:05
The other way it helps honest, hard working people is if they save.  
When the 2% spend their bitcoins on luxurious items while I'm frugal, there will be no cohorts at banks that can just lend them more for whatever they want.  If they want to retain their wealth, they'll have to work to provide real services for others AND not spend so lavishly with an ever-increasing printed money supply that just devalues my savings.
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:59:19
They need to get some in Mexico and the US so folks can easily send money back home.
@_date: 2013-10-22 06:10:11
Remittance has been talked about a lot here.  The businesses in tourist areas has not.  That should be a major focus imo.
@_date: 2013-10-21 00:09:29
Bitcoins were created for the same reason.  It's naive to think they weren't imo.
There's nothing wrong with it.  Folks should get rich off it.  It's brilliant and will help humanity.
@_date: 2013-10-20 23:22:42
I disagree wholeheartedly.  I see them as insurance for one thing.  For instance, if something happens to bitcoin, the others are there to step in.
This fact alone may prevent governments from going after bitcoin.  Heck, just look at what's happening with the Silk Road situation.  They cut off one head of the hydra and 10 popped up in it's place.
Also, it's quite easy for Coinbase, bitpay and others to set up a multitude of payment options.
I understand this is the popular sentiment.  I just feel it hurts adoption.
When you denigrate an altcoin, you are really denigrating a younger bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-02 23:50:43
You sound uninformed.  The ultra rich don't necessarily become rich that way.  They stay rich that way though.
What do you think the central bankers actually do?  New money production is a tax on the poor and an interest earning tool for the rich.  Not very fair is it?
@_date: 2013-11-01 12:45:07
You sir...are a moron.
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:17:05
Your denial or stupidity is only humorous at this point.  
Post your real name here so we can record it for posterity in the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-10-23 12:50:22
In my opinion, new alt coins are the acceptable inflation.  They are controlled by the market.
What is not acceptable is fiat being shoved down our throats with bullshit money transmitter laws and these terrorist FINCEN bitches.
@_date: 2013-11-02 23:55:38
The man will be the first to attack bitcoin in the most subversive way possible.
@_date: 2013-10-29 01:45:18
Bitcoin is money.  How would you go about making money?
@_date: 2013-10-20 23:45:47
That's a GOOD point.  
I think though it's easily explained by saying there are other options out there but the infrastructure and stability they offer is nowhere near as good or recognizable as bitcoin.
Personally, I don't even tell others about altcoins until they adopt and use bitcoins.  It's just once they have, it feels foolish to pretend the altcoins don't exist or they are all bad.
@_date: 2013-10-30 00:01:22
Imo no one should identify themselves with any ideology.  Human interaction is too complex to be boiled down to a handful of principles.
@_date: 2013-10-27 19:46:42
They don't take bitcoin so they can't be too serious about anonymity. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 04:03:01
I made a point here the other day which was overlooked and I am going to keep restating.  With bitcoin, it's ok if a few have a ton.  They can't get their crooked cronies at banks to just print more and give them free money for projects and just file bankruptcy when it doesn't pan out.
The ultra wealthy will have to actually provide real services that are sustainable and stand up to lower end competition.  
@_date: 2013-11-01 03:40:21
You idiot.  I'm certain I'm a LOT older than you and I KNOW the elite cheat.  That is the nature of the game.  I've been around a long time and I can give you MANY personal examples.  MANY, MANY, MANY. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 05:01:45
Fuck you.

Yep...then you wait 3 months to get your USD out of MT. Gox.
@_date: 2013-11-01 03:49:12
I would almost guarantee you that my net worth is greater than yours.  I HAVE worked and saved my way to wealth.  I DO know that there are those that don't have to do this at all.
The current system keeps those people in control without ever having to earn their money.
I should have titled the article "Does Bitcoin help prevent the 2% from maintaining extremely unfair advantages?"
I think it does.
I think bitcoin will reward those that work and save.  The current banking system is a complete scam that rewards those with connections, influence and family name.
@_date: 2013-10-29 20:24:52
Forget mining now unless you have 1000s upon 1000s to spend.  If you buy them, just backup your wallet.dat file and you're golden.
@_date: 2013-11-01 03:48:45
That's not the same thing at all.  There is a huge difference between cheating the system and being born in an impoverished area.
