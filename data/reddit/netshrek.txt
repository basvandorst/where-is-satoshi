Do you want me to make a new version of changetip?

I alluded to that in my "a lot of ways to try to profit from this". But I wanted to make a distinction that you weren't stealing BTC as a direct result of the attack but rather by scamming/double spending.  Many people I talk to are very confused about what a 51% situation really means.

20 BTC tip there worth $4.7k at the time.

$250k in BTC is not hard to get, plenty of OTC services. Looks like they are probably trying to stall for some other reason.

Can't really steal bitcoins with 51%, rather censor any transactions you choose from going through, reverse your own transactions and dominate the block reward.  There are a lot of ways to try to profit from this, but taking other people's bitcoins isn't possible.

Google is going to change the world for AR. Think project tango ultra low latency pass through with developer access. They learned a lot from Glass and daydream is the start. Smartphones already feel like a burden, not a blessing.

It's my understanding that changetip didn't fail for a technical reason, but was shut down because the company got acquired by airbnb and transitioned to work on airbnb products instead of tipbots.

... you don't necessarily need QC to crack anything.  Cryptographic research has shown flaws through logic and the development of mathematics rather than "more compute power".  In fact, it's much more likely that modern cryptography (RSA, EC, and the like) will be found to be fatally flawed through a paper from MIT or something than some secret physics project.  The shit can't even factor triple digit numbers right now.
As for your "total agreement", it's a bunch of shit.  The primary attack QC brings is Shor's algorithm which is trivially defeated by switching to a quantum safe algorithm (annoying but easy) OR appropriately increasing key size (annoying but easy) OR... wait for it... properly using bitcoin change addresses without address reuse.  If you didn't send your btc back to yourself, you're safe.
Now please illuminate your opposition to QC and your total agreement that QC can mathematically crack "encryption", I can't wait to see what you type next.

Bitcoin still only has 21MM coins. Altcoins and forks can do what they want. Look at the block explorer and tell me the cap has changed.
Even if you strongly don't agree with the fork details, I personally respect forks as a thing in general. Forks are the beauty of a distributed open source currency. No one can stop you from forking. There is no boss to control the chain or the code.  Every chain survives only from the support of the community and immense efforts from the devs.
It may affect the price, but I wouldn't have it any other way. The right to fork is the nature of the technology.

Define "real backing"? Most assets and currencies don't have a real backing.  Gold, for example, is pretty and has some industrial uses but its value is orders of magnitude higher than it can justify for those cases.  It's valuable truly because it is a decoupling mechanism from fiat, because it has perceived scarcity, and because others will accept it.
Fiat currencies "backing" is the threat of force.  That is, if you don't use fiat to pay your taxes someone will show up with a gun eventually and take you somewhere dark.  I don't really consider this a real backing, but rather artificial forced usage.  In this case, usage is giving the currency value, not any sort of intrinsic attribute of the underlying asset, especially since we are long removed from the gold standard.  Even with this forced usage many government currencies are mismanaged.  Money is printed and inflation occurs causing these massive dips and spikes in value that you speak of, and it's devastating to people who hold that currency.  Fiat currencies hold no guarantee of scarcity.
The closest thing I can imagine with a "real backing" is probably oil, which has experienced high volatility at times in its past.  These weren't good situations, but they didn't remove the fact that oil was still useful, and still worth something, and the recovery came.
Bitcoin has stronger scarcity guarantees than gold and is also easier to hold, manage, and send than gold.  It's gaining usability that isn't forced, like fiat, but rather voluntary.  It's a stateless, geopolitically removed network that doesn't live and die by the whims of people in the financial offices of a single country.  I certainly don't imagine a small team of humans deciding how much to devalue my bank account in 100 years, I imagine no one having that power. 
Back to your question about volatility. It's true that massive dips and spikes in value aren't the best for a world currency, but bitcoin is still in growth and expansion phases.  The more money that flows in, the more dramatic changes would be required to push the price up or down.  Furthermore, the longer it's around and the larger it becomes the less nervous and reactive people are, and the more financial instruments are introduced which can help stabilize price.  I believe this future will come, and while I'm happy to use it as a polished, highly efficient, mostly stable, "solved" currency then, I rather be on board way before.  The volatility stages are where you get your position and can make a name for yourself in the project and shape its future.  Of course, I admit it's high risk right now, but the best things in life often are.

You created a taxable event every time you switched to ETH (and back).  Thus, you're expected to pay taxes on your gains (or losses) for every crypto to crypto trade.  For example, if you bought BTC with USD at $100, then you traded into ETH at $200/BTC, you'd be expected to pay the cap gains on the $100 difference.

There are several ways one could alter a block, so you'd have to be more specific.
If the block is basically malformed, it is simply ignored as trash.
If the block is valid (valid solution, valid transaction signatures, valid previous block) but old, it is ignored as a stale block since the current chain has a higher cumulative difficulty and a longer chain.  Unless, of course, the attacker has a longer chain/higher cumulative difficulty which would imply 51%.
There is no audible alert as it happens all the time when nodes are severely out of sync, stuck on a fork, or two miners find a block at the same time.  This is why it's important to wait for multiple confirmations.  Competing blocks are a normal occurrence. 
Every miner would not experience the same thing in every case, since there is a variety of software and daemons running, each with various implementations.  However, they must all behavior similarly with expected scenarios else they are non standard and are likely to end up rejected by the rest of the network.  In the case that there's a vulnerability, though, it is unlikely to affect the entire network.

Yes, it can certainly be tampered to install a backdoor.
No, there is no absolutely sure way to know your device has not been backdoored and certain attacks will not be fixed by any sort of reinitialization.  They do [have a guide that can help you be sure with high confidence](
) , but in no way is it 100%.
However I've never heard of it happening and the chances are pretty slim that you'll get a compromised device.  The best things you can do are:
-Inspect the packaging upon arrival.  Make sure nothing looks sketchy.  Does it look like the unboxing videos online?
-Inspect the device.  Are there any stress marks or scratches around ridges, or where parts of the case meet?  Does the device color, texture, screen look like the videos?  If you decide to open it, do the internals look like exactly like the blog post above?
-Were there any odd delays with your package?  Was it routed somewhere that doesn't make sense?
-Buy directly from Ledger, don't use third parties.
-Transfer a significant amount of funds to the device and wait some amount of time (day, week, month) before transferring the rest (majority) of your funds.  If the device is compromised the initial amount may be enough to trigger a theft.
-Take high quality photos of the package before it's open and the device before it's used, from multiple angles.  Save all the packaging material.  In the case that backdooring or a fake device is discovered and published, this can help you identify if your device is affected, perhaps before the attacker can sweep the funds.

Scaling is great, sharding as a solution is not.  By sharding contracts, you prevent or complicate "cross talk" between shards.  As an expressive development platform features like this are really important to your core value offering (imo).  I do think it's an OK solution but not an ideal one.

Details? What was the 0.026043 BTC tx spent for?

Bitcoin is built for security as a financial instrument.  Ethereum is complex and expressive but it compromises on security and clarity as a result.
Bitcoin does better as a store of value.  Ethereum does better as a platform.  I'd prefer to have my money in BTC and build on Ethereum.
I do think they both have a bright future, it's not winner take all, but I think ETH is currently overvalued and BTC undervalued.  This is because BTC is doing great at achieving it's goals of being a secure store of value while ETH is trying to solve scaling issues with sharding which decreases it's value as a platform.
