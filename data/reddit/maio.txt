Congrats on public release!
I tried to play with your dev env, but I can't make it work. I did create several charges, and tried both on-chain &amp; LN payments. But none of them seems to work.
E.g., last charge which I payed using (testnet) on-chain transaction:

Actual limit is much larger than 255 chars - see  - I believe it should be OK for this use-case.

Firefox: 100000+ characters

Thanks for feedback. You probably aren't target audience. As mentioned in post I created it because I wanted something simple which I could give to non-tech(&amp; Bitcoin for that matter) savvy person. I gifted small amount of Bitcoin to the person, I bundled instructions to access it (cold storage), and included link to balance to (hopefully) spark their interest after some time. I wanted to make it as easy as possible for the person. Installing some app, doing setup &amp; stuff was out of question (at this point).

Just use passphrase for additional entropy.

Can't you just use Bitcoin ATM? Here they don't require anything except cash and target address, at least for smaller amounts.
