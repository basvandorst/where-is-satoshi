He raves for good three minutes about "cite me some code", but I wonder where his code is. Ironically Gavin is a coder and all his proposed changes have code.

Neato. I've been using bitcoin for remittance purposes to Mexico for quite a while. While this service looks super easy to use, but it's not very cost-effective compared to bitso.com (The biggest exchange in Mexico).
At current prices, 1 BTC = 1019.24 USD (coinbase). Then I sell it on bitso for $22,290.00 * 0.99  and a free withdrawal to any SPEI account.
So in total, for 1 bitcoin if I use bitso my recipient will get: $22,067.1 while bridge21 will get $20,708.98. That's quite a big price difference to pay for convenience.

It was sent with 346.18 satoshis/byte,  which is about 3-4x of what would've been required to have high confidence it gets mined in the next block. 
I guess that doesn't help if you're using something like bitcoin core's wallet which hugely overestimates fees. But regardless, fees are indeed definitely too high.

Sure, but if I'm careful to never reveal my witness script, (i.e. never try spend from it) it's unguessable, right?

But if I only give out my "SegWit-in-P2SH" address (i.e. the one starting with 3...), there's no way for anyone to predict it, right?

Never heard of CryoBit, and their website doesn't inspire much confidence. I'm extremely happy with my trezor though

Look at his other open tabs, and have a guess

huh? If they can directly extract data, they don't need to brute force. And they would grab the private key, not the pin. But if you're worried about a super advanced attacker with the capabilities of breaking a HSM you should also be using an extremely strong password too
@_date: 2015-09-24 14:18:10
The trezor itself protects against brute forcing of the pin with an exponentially increasing retry time. I once forgot a single digit of my pin, and struggled to brute force it due to this

It'll be fine. Just give it half a day

If you don't like opt-in RBF then don't use it. Don't accept opt-in RBF transactions as payment until they have a single confirmation.
If we want to use it between consenting parties, than frankly it's none of your business.


That's not true. Let's say I'm sending my friend money and 0.1% of the time I make a fat-finger mistake. The 99.9% of times I do it properly, I don't want a delay. Also, I might not realize there's a mistake until my friend sees the transaction, or I see it on block explorer


Yes.

It's about doing something in coinjoin, that is only possible with RBF..

The real question is, if the price went down would they be giving you a refund?  If so, then that's a reasonably policy they have.

On the other hand bithra is a lot easier for people to understand, and easier to convince them to accept because there's no fees or sign up required. Plus I think the chance of bithra running away with the funds is the same as bitrated colluding with a seller to rip off a buyer or colluding with a seller to rip off a buyer.
If I was buying a house in bitcoin, I wouldn't use either and if I was ordering coffee tablets, I'd rather just take the simple approach

No, not at all. The passphrase is used to generate addresses (including the public ones), so without this it is completely useless for all actions other than asking for a passphrase...

Someone is abusing transaction malleability to change the hash of transactions. They still however arrive in the correct place, so the payment processor has absolutely no reason to not credit your purchase.

When you use coinbase you become their customer, unlike circle where just a number that they'll attempt to leverage to hemorrhage more investor money. Having used both, the service, quality and support is a day and night difference, I can assure you coinbase is worth the 1% fee.
In other words, don't expect much from a free service...

Wallet bug. blockchain.info's wallet suffers this, just ignore it and it'll (eventually) resolve itself, no money has actually been lost
@_date: 2016-05-08 13:19:50
For most cases, I've found bithra.com to be a lot more usable alternative.
