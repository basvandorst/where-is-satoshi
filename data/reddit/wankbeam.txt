1. Big company starts accepting Bitcoin.
2. General population unfazed.
3. Early adopters with 1000+ Bitcoins go on shopping sprees.
4. Big company cashes out.
5. Price drops.

So if I understand correctly this only affects exchanges and not bitcoin holders who have Canadian bank accounts ?
i.e. As a Canadian I can still buy on foreign exchanges and withdraw to my Canadian bank account ?

It's not because it's negative news. It's because that it's the 12390129301th false alarm coming from China in less than half a year. Naturally, "Bitcoin redditors" would start assuming that it is FUD. 
It's going to take a lot more to convince me that these news are genuine.

So, we always bash on GHash.io for getting dangerously close to the 51% hash rate (as we should).
What makes the average consumer want to get in on Bitcoin with the knowledge that one guy (Satochi) owns 1/13th of the total bitcoins in circulation ? 
How am I supposed to believe that he won't one day wake up and decide to dump it all on the market and cash out ?

Yeah I read the official announcements not long ago. But if I remember, the April 15th panic had some official statements from some Chinese exchanges that did not turn out to be true ? 
I don't even know anymore man, I'll just stay off the BTC related news for the next month. Zzz

I don't know man, a friend of mine, just like you, convinced me that Bitcoin was the best thing since sliced bread. I bought 2.5 BTCs last year for 2250$ total. Today, they are worth around 750$.
Can you guarantee to your friends and family that it will go up ? No you cannot. Smarter and better investors than you exist, and if there was any guarantee that the price was going to jump soon, they would have all jumped in on it. Except no. Companies like CoinBase open a licensed US exchange and the price barely moves. People are simply uninterested today. 
Point is, you cannot force adoption of a new technology on the masses. They will adopt it when they see the benefits. Even though there's a huge potential in this new technology, right now, there's almost zero reason to use it.
