Nice. Care to back up your comment?
@_date: 2016-08-20 03:08:47
Thanks for the feedback.
@_date: 2016-08-20 03:08:14
um, we do show USD along with many other currency pairs. Perhaps I'm not understanding you?
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:30:46
We like to think we are. Please hit me up if you have any questions about Jaxx.
@_date: 2016-08-11 17:20:29
We add friction points that will hopefully deter people from compiling everything together. That's the balance I'm speaking of. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 20:30:13
Not all of them yet. But very soon.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:44:13
Jaxx wasn't available last year. Perhaps you're thinking of something different?
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:43:28
Thanks for the feedback and kind words. We've recently announced our own [cold storage device]( called the Jaxx Ice Cube. In the meantime we're working to integrate with Ledger. Haven't had any talks with Trezor at this point but perhaps we should.
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:32:55
You can audit the code via our website and directly through inspecting the extension versions. With any iOS app you have zero way of knowing or seeing the code on the Apple app store.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:55:42
You can inspect the code directly using our extension versions. Right click, inspect element, all the code is there. You can also decompile the android version and view the entire code. We are not deciding on licensing options at this time. Its very complex and our focus is on development. 
@_date: 2016-08-20 03:08:58
It's something we're discussing.
@_date: 2016-08-20 03:07:14
How did Jaxx lose you 359 ETH? We have never lost customer funds due to an issue on our end.
@_date: 2016-08-23 13:29:23
Jaxx is available across 9 platforms and devices including Windows.  Android &amp; iOS Mobile and Tablet. Windows, Linux, Apple Desktop. Chrome and Firefox Extensions.
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:07:13
Thanks for the feedback. We agree that being able to point to your own node is important for some people. Plans are in the works to tackle this and provide more choice for users in this regards. Stay tuned.

Caution that open source and visible code bases are very easy for scammers to copy the code and release, leading to situations like we are facing now. This is a downside of open source in the wallet space. What you want to do is stick with companies that have been around for a long time, have office locations, phone numbers etc., and owners / staff that are highly visible in the community.
btw you can see the entire jaxx code base via the extension versions and the android version. On our site we do not release the UI code as people have been ripping it off and cloning our products which lead to major issues for people thinking they are dealing with us. Sometimes is good to be able to create friction points so that scammers can't push out cloned copies easily.
If you don't want to use jaxx because we haven't open sourced the code, that's fine. Over the years we've realized that customers mostly want control of their keys, a good wallet experience, good customer support, and visible auditable code. That's what we offer. There's a very small hard-core "open source" or nothing group, and when you're building businesses, these people don't fully understand all the other factors involved when dealing with investors and with monetization. We may go open-source in the future if it makes sense.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:01:39
For many reasons. We own the code, we are a business, and we need to stay in business. Our code is audible and visible and that's what most people care about. We do not what cloned copies of our products out everywhere. That leads to much more headaches and issues. People seem to be realizing that now with the recent problems.

You can consider them very secure as long as you have full control over your PC. Just ensure to set a pin for extra security and please make sure to backup your wallet. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 20:18:02
Thanks for the mention. Jaxx can be easily paired between devices and is available on 9 platforms. iOS &amp; Android (Mobile and Tablet), Windows, Linux, Apple Desktop. Chrome &amp; Firefox Extension. Keys are stored client-side and code is visible and audible on our website and via inspecting the extensions or the android app. jaxx.io.
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:54:08
Jaxx is not open source although all the code (minus UI) is visible on our website and full code is directly visible via inspecting the extension versions and the android app. Much of the issues of cloned wallets we're seeing recently is due to code be easily available, copied and distributed. We see that as a bigger problem and we do not desire clones of Jaxx (malicious or not) to be floating around. Leads to much more problems and confusion and we're trying to find a balance that's makes it difficult to take and distribute our code while still allowing it to be audited by those that wish to do so. Should you want to discuss further feel free to hit me up at a.diiorio on skype or give me a call. Phone number is on our decentral.ca website.

@_date: 2014-01-02 14:22:54
For yesterday's soft launch I didn't have it hooked up to any exchange as I was selling from my own supply. My thoughts on fair pricing is that we should offer our customers comparable rates to what they can buy BTC on Localbitcoins.com. I therefore checked to see what reputable Toronto Lobalbitcoins.com dealers were selling at yesterday priced it accordingly so that we offered the best price. I see ATMs as being more aligned with LB then the exchanges. 
I will listen and respond to the BTC community here in Toronto and when I've made more concrete decision on pricing I will announce my strategy and provide rationale. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 23:36:42

Anything past the # in the url never leaves the address bar. The code is also open and auditable. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 23:36:06
Read the reviews on the Google chrome store. It is open source and the code is auditable. However, your private key is stored client-side and never sent to any servers, same with your GPG private key. Therefore only you have access to your Bitcoins and we don't hold or know your password / keys. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:27:07
haha. Very nice Martin!
@_date: 2014-01-02 14:24:16
For yesterday we were coming in $10 cheaper / btc then the best Toronto LocalBitcoin price (at least that's what we did when we set the formula before the event started)

Agreed this does defeat the purpose of Bitcoin. Check out the crowd-funding platform at [rushwallet.com]( No logins or signups, free to create and run fundraisers, decentralised,  you can remove funds while the campaign is still going on, and only the creator of the fundraiser has access to the bitcoins at any given time.

Anthony from [Kryptokit]( here. Only issue we've ever had with someone losing BTC with a KK account is when the user created a brain wallet so poor his coins were scooped up by a bot in a second. Rest assured KK is secure and is not affected by the recent rash of malicious chrome extensions. Also, very soon we'll be announcing our new hardware wallet that binds to Kryptokit providing safe easy cold storage. The prototype is complete, the parts are readily available, and mass production will begin soon.

I am still figuring out the limits I will offer. The machine will continually be retrofitted and I'm expecting a "cash recycler" to be installed within a couple weeks to a months. This will enable both buy / sell and the cash will be handled with one system so that it doesn't need to be monitored so closely and emptied frequently. We are developing our KYC (Know Your Customer) strategy. The machine uses phone number verification via pin, can scan identification, and offers a fingerprint scanner. However, I DO NOT intend on using the fingerprint scanner. I just don't think that makes sense to implement, i mean I don't know any other place that asks for a fingerprint.
I have to decide what limits will be offered and what identity verification at different levels. Stay tuned for more info.

It comes equipped with phone number verification via text message, fingerprint scanner, and ID scanner. I'm still deciding which to implement as I'm not too keen on the fingerprint scanner. I mean I don't know any other business / bank requiring that so I don't see why we would want our customers to have to do that. We'll release more specific details tomorrow night.

Thanks for posting Coinkite. The response from the media and the BTC community in Toronto over the last couple weeks has been great. From concept to launch Bitcoin Decental opened in about 1 week and more details of our plan for the space will be announced soon. 
After the soft launch of the ATM at a previous meetup and having it open part-time since, we're ready to launch it full-time starting Monday. Also, we expect the cash recycler to arrive in a couple weeks to make it a 2-way buy/sell machine. Feel free to drop and check out the facility if you're in the area. Every Wednesday we hold a [Bitcoin meetup]( as well. Everyone's welcome.

The plan is it offer backing from many exchanges so that we can get our customers the best pricing and provide options. This will be worked on soon. To start we'll be backing with our own BTC, at least for awhile. It's also been tested with Bitstamp and works great. More details on all this will be relayed in the coming weeks.
@_date: 2014-01-01 00:02:42
So its one way right now. We expect it to go both ways in 1-2 weeks. The good news about the team working on this is that made it locally and can easily retrofit and add features. I'm the test case for them with the first machine. Still haven't decided the limits yet. I'll be working with the team tomorrow when they come to Toronto for the final setup before the launch tomorrow night.

@_date: 2016-03-09 14:41:08
Sorry, but you're completely wrong. Are you guessing there are vulnerabilities in chrome extensions that would effect our wallet, or do you have something to back that claim up with? 
Extensions are much more secure that web wallets. We secure tens of thousands of wallets in Chrome, and have been doing so since 2013 with 6000 weekly users on average. Never have we had a case of lost customer funds. The code in extensions is completely auditable, and keys are stored client and never sent to any servers. 
Also, thanks to Kryptokit, [Google Chrome team came out]( and directly said they are fine with Bitcoin wallets in Chrome.
@_date: 2016-03-09 12:07:12
We launched Kryptokit, world's first Bitcoin wallet in the browser, in 2013. Just recently we launched its predecessor Jaxx. Check it out at jaxx.io

Anthony from Kryptokit here. 3rd party relay service blockr.io is still down. Coins are safe, just check your address on any explorer. Redundancies to be added this week as part of our push to get out of beta.

It was no mystery at all. [Google actually reached out]( to explain that Kryptokit was removed in error, and ultimately no user funds were lost.
Even if our current extension wallet, Jaxx, or Kryptokit, disappears "mysteriously," as long as you have a secure copy of your mnemonic written down (or your backup), you'll be able to restore your wallet on another version of Jaxx (i.e. Android, iOS mobile, or desktop), or any other app that has the mnemonic import feature.

Hey there. Anthony from Jaxx here. I use the ledger nano S and have also used Trezor before for cold storage of large amounts. We're working towards hardware integration in Jaxx, but until then I'd recommend using a hardware solution to manage large amounts. Frankly, just the safer approach.

I'm sure others from the event will be chiming, however, I think this way because of what I observed. It's great to see the different camps communicating and trying to understand each other point of view, however, I don't think there was any definitive "win" for Bitcoin that came out of the Satoshi Roundtable. I was really hoping this could be a defining moment for the future of Bitcoin where something tangible would be decided upon, considering we had so many influencers together.    
@_date: 2016-02-20 01:22:56
After our 12+ platform release, we are planning to institute a global messaging system via PGP which will enable all devices running Jaxx to communicate. This will allow for features such as a secure, synced single passwords (or pins) and global settings across devices. We are purposely not instituting a password system now in order to remove complexities that would occur as we switch over to the new system. That being said, due to the demand for a pin, I'm going to put some thought into how we can satisfy the requests while not hindering our future plans. Know that right now our main priority is to get Jaxx out and honor our release schedule while fixing bugs and adding requested features that are aligned with future plans. In the meantime, as Jaxx is a beta product, we do not recommend using Jaxx to store  large amounts - stick only to amounts you'd be willing to lose. If you're using Jaxx on a mobile device, you always have the option to set a PIN on your phone. Cheers!
@_date: 2016-02-29 01:33:01

I think it can be considered a success in that it brought together so many industry influences.

The problem is the limited amount of beta accounts Apple allows us. I'll see what I can do to get you in.
@_date: 2016-02-18 17:24:28

Thanks Erik. It's been a long time coming as you well know. Regarding SS integration, we're still working on the Infrastructure phase (Stage 1) of Jaxx. Integrations phase is Stage 2.
Stage 1 includes rolling out the numerous versions across all devices and platforms with a unified codebase and UX / UI. This codebase (done in HTML and JS) allows us to deploy on different platforms and devices rapidly with very minimal customization. Stage 1 also includes enabling our PGP messaging layer that will allow all devices to talk to each-other and sign messages back and forth. (ie, single passwords done in a decentralized fashion across all devices). See our announcement about bringing PGP into Bitcoin [here](
Phase 2 (integrations such as Shapeshift) is easily achieved once the groundwork of Stage 1 has been completed.
Our goal is to become the default wallet for Bitcoin and Ethereum. We believe Jaxx's single page design-led UX, easy to deploy unified codebase, ability to pair on over a dozen devices, and unique messaging layer gives us an edge in appealing to the masses. 
I expect the integration phase to begin in March and SS is first on the list. Let's make it a goal to work together to have it done by the end of March, or sooner if possible.

We did it as an Easter Egg with a contest and awarded 25 Ether to the first person to figure it out. It also is a way for the Bitcoin Community to have a wallet when they might not necessarily want an Ether one up front.
@_date: 2016-02-11 22:43:09
Thanks for notifying us. It's been fixed. Stay tuned for the launch of our new site.
@_date: 2016-02-25 22:35:59
Yes! Finally exactly on schedule! :)
@_date: 2016-02-18 23:22:37
Well I'm not a Firefox addon dev but I do know that XPI's are addon files for Firefox. Just like CRX's for Chrome extensions. More info [here]( 
@_date: 2016-09-14 12:44:43
Jaxx iOS 10 update should be ready soon. 
@_date: 2016-09-21 18:01:20
Dash has been removed from iOS versions due to Apple request. It's still available on our other 7 platforms - Android (Mobile and Tablet) Firefox and Chrome extensions, Linux, Mac, PC desktop. [jaxx.io](
@_date: 2016-09-30 01:34:03
In Jaxx you can see all previously used addresses / keys via Menu =&gt; Tools =&gt; Display Private Keys. 
@_date: 2016-09-21 15:48:36
There was an issue with iOS 10 affecting many wallet companies (in our industry). 
@_date: 2016-09-30 01:33:04
For future reference, you can see all previously used addresses / keys via Menu =&gt; Tools =&gt; Display Private Keys. Cheers!
@_date: 2016-10-31 12:19:54
All? No. But [Jaxx]( currently supports 7 coins, (9 by the end of the week) with 15 more on the way soon. We are available on 9 platforms; iOS &amp; Android Mobile &amp; Tablet, Windows, Mac, Linux Desktop, Chrome and Firefox Extension. It's HD and keys to supported assets are held client-side and can be derived from a single backup phrase. Hardware wallet integration is in the works via [Jaxx Ice Cube]( Ledger will also be integrated in the new year.
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:37:16
Cool. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-05-29 02:36:59
Thanks! Currently, we're using etherscan.io for balances and pushing transactions. Adding our own system for redundancy shortly. It's built just needs to be implemented.
@_date: 2015-03-17 13:34:30
Getting all the last minutes preparations done. Super excited. Picking Andreas up at the airport in a couple hours.
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:39:33
The issue does not seem to be with Blockchain.info. Most likely to do with an update pushed yesterday. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 13:35:07
fyi It will not be live streamed but we do we plan on putting the entire video up on decentral.tv in the coming weeks.
@_date: 2016-05-28 22:43:29
The plan is for the remaining 1.0 versions to come out together on one day of the "7 days of Jaxx". 
@_date: 2015-10-28 20:38:26
shhh. Don't mention Ethereum. The post will disapear.
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:37:08
We plan on adding a ton more coins. Stay tuned.
@_date: 2016-05-29 14:04:10
sorry, currently using 3 systems for redundancy. Blockr.io, Blockcypher, and Blockchain.info.
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:07:52
IBM and Samsung chose three protocols – BitTorrent (file sharing), Ethereum (smart contracts) and TeleHash (peer-to-peer messaging) – to underpin the ADEPT concept. The ADEPT concept, or Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry, taps blockchains to provide the backbone of the system, utilizing a mix of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake to secure transactions.
@_date: 2015-03-24 13:38:37
Anthony from Kryptokit here. We pushed a new update for KK yesterday and are looking into the send issue at the moment. We'll post back here and on  once its been resolved. Sorry for the trouble.
@_date: 2016-07-31 01:07:10
I'd like to throw Jaxx into the ring. Unified single screen experience across all devices and syncs easy on iOS &amp; Android (tablet and mobile), Firefox &amp; Chrome Ext. versions, &amp; Linux + Windows + Apple desktop. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:25:45
Thanks! I think it will be a lot of fun.
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:34:17
I think it's irresponsible to make such statements unless you actually know the complete details of the contract between the 2 companies and the finer details. Not that I'm saying they did but if Mt. Gox is guilty of breaking a contract wouldn't Mr. Vessenes have every right to seek damages?
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:25:29
Awesome! I've been to Berlin a few times, wonderful city. I'd love to sit a round and have a beer and talk BTC.
@_date: 2016-07-31 01:10:14
Premine went not just to devs but to over 50 people who contributed efforts to the project before the crowdsale. ie founders who loaned money for the initial months, marketing team, etc. etc.
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:04:32
Sounds like a good idea. I'll hit you up when I start booking the flights.
@_date: 2013-05-16 19:37:51
Are you referring to the Toronto meetup? The San Jose meetup will be a one off (or every year at a convention?)
@_date: 2013-06-15 13:09:20
If the price point isn't too high, how about a portable hard drive with the features you listed (Biometric, USB, Bluetooth etc.) for the mass public, with the added feature of a Bitcoin hardware wallet? 
@_date: 2013-08-08 04:01:23
Awesome job organizing Alex! 
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:47:38
I was was San Francisco last year. Had a blast, the boardwalk is amazing. Would love to go back again.
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:23:50
It's already in my resources list. Good idea however. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:41:44
It will be dispensing coins tomorrow. Works with cash only.
@_date: 2013-05-03 06:47:39
How about localbitcoins? what city are you in?
@_date: 2013-05-04 01:02:49
Thanks mate!
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:42:42
Yes there is.
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:43:43
Great offer. Adding you to the database now.
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:27:42
PM me and I'd be happy to discuss this further and help out in any way I can.
@_date: 2013-06-10 04:55:10
I think it was the best yet. The presentation sparked a lot of questions and debate. It was a really good crowd, 30-40 I think showed up. Thanks for making it out. Hope to see you next Saturday.
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:23:56
Will do!
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:55:09
Sweet. We're soft launching the ATM (BTM) tomorrow and expect to have it open full-time the second week of January. We're in the mist of renovating the building. The first floor is ready to go, the rest should be competed in a couple weeks.
@_date: 2013-05-03 02:54:40
Not quite sure yet which part of any continent yet, except perhaps going to South Africa. Your offer sounds good though. I'll keep it in mind when I'm planing the Australia leg. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:50:06
We think it encompasses what we were going after quite nicely.
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:49:45
Thanks partner!
@_date: 2013-05-03 06:18:21
I understand and appreciate your position. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 19:50:16
As do we Ed! To make do I could I could always give you guys a call to update from the Convention.
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:21:19
Sweet. I may take you up on that offer for the Australia leg of the trip.
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:40:31
Agreed. 9flats will be a great asset.
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:55:31
Drinks are already on ice :)
@_date: 2013-07-17 19:54:21
You may want to rethink your strategy next time. The video, and written statement was horribly executed. 
@_date: 2013-06-15 13:06:12
Here's a thought. How about a Biometric hardware wallet? Please explain why you think it has to be one or the other?
Also, why does the fingerprint have to generate the encryption keys? Wouldn't it be good enough just to unlock the device to access the data (keys) that are already on the ATMEL chip?
I believe they are looking to see how the Biometrics could compliment or be added to Bitcoin hardware projects.  Not just trying to produce "biometric crap".
@_date: 2013-05-03 06:43:30
Good idea. I agree. A coordinated effort for 1 special day would be significant.
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:32:25
Thanks for the tip. Unfortunately Wufoo doesn't offer SSL on their free account. If this is a concern for anyone please PM me and I can get you to send an email to me directly.
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:07:27
I began investing in Bitcoin back when it was around $10. My initial investment was $7,000. Since then I've spent about $100,000 buying at varying prices up to $140/BTC. I'd rather not mention exactly how many I have but lets say it's more than several hundred.
Regarding SatoshiCircle, I hope we can release data in the future but for now, for a few different reasons, I can't disclose any of the financials. All I can do is give you some stats on the game. We've had almost 2000 players accounts created so far, and over 650,000 spins since launching roughly 5 weeks ago. We're currently averaging 20,000 spins a day.
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:42:19
Tentatively September / October 2013
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:46:32
We'll be neighbors.
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:51:02
No it isn't. 
@_date: 2013-06-20 02:34:43
(taken right from the press release)
The BAC is a not-for-profit organization of Bitcoin enthusiasts in Canada, dedicated to promoting Bitcoin with dynamic perspectives and clarity in the media, providing information and resources to merchants and consumers, and facilitating discussions with banks and government bodies in Canada.
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:20:26
I guess the worst that would happen would be I cancel the trip. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:06:22
I'm not sure what you're getting at.
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:42:09
Check out this link. You should be able to procure Bitcoins this way. Let me know how you make out.
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:49:08
I've been there a couple times. They really are a committed crew. Great job!
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:42:29
@_date: 2013-10-12 00:04:23
I don't have that info as I wasn't directly involved. I''ll shoot the guy an email and try to get more details as to the process..
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:03:09
Will do!
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:47:43
Thanks Jason! It came together quite nicely. Super psyched for when the furniture comes and the place gets bustling. We already have people asking for work space. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:32:18
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:33:52
100% agree. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 18:53:32
Great find Slavik. This could be really big.
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:40:12
Good ole Ed and Ethan. It should be a lot of fun. Website is in the works, I'll blog frequently. I'm still in the early planning stages. right now but the response from the Bitcoin community has been great so far!
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:56:06
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:37:10
Why do you think I think anyone cares about the judgments of the state? I find your last 2 messages really confusing and I"m not sure what I wrote that you are responding to.
@_date: 2013-05-03 04:35:44
Will do!
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:52:51
Please drop by and say hi. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 06:37:33
Only thing I can suggest is that if you have a smartphone with a good camera there are some pretty decent apps out there that turns your phone into a scanner. I use my phone as a scanner all the time and the quality is excellent! 
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:38:11
Thanks for reaching out Jim. I'll make a note of that.
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:40:43
Thanks for the offer!
@_date: 2013-06-14 06:45:40
There aren't many but there are a few.
 - Army Surplus Store
  - Office space rentals
 - Hypnotherapy Clinic
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:35:49
Wow, thanks for the offer. I probably will swing by Vancouver and also check out Sunshine Coast, BC. I hear they are trying to turn the area in a BTC friendly destination and have a few shops there accepting BTC including a coffee shop, and a hostel and a couple others. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:51:11
Come on by!
@_date: 2013-05-03 06:57:42
Definitely not my style. Cudos for getting it made though!
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:31:15
I didn't **have** to ask for help here, thought it would be a good idea however and from what I can see so far so does the majority of those that have responded. No need to change my identify, I think I'll stay as "me" thank you very much.
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:43:22
Is that at current prices? lol
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:49:35
Thanks man. It's been a real team effort, many people involved it getting this done quickly. Thanks to everyone who helped out.
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:22:24
Cool. I may just take you up on that offer.
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:10:48
I appreciate your input. Spending a 3-5 days in a city or two in each continent should be easy enough. I'll pick the cities that are most Bitcoin friendly and hook up with Bitcoin enthusiasts etc. Trade BTC for lodging and food. I obviously don't plan I buying from vendors on the street that don't own computers or smart phones.
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:45:43
We couldn't think of a better location. That part of Spadina Avenue has many tens of thousands of cars pass by daily, and the amount of walking traffic at King Street and Spadina if massive.
Thanks for the well wishes.
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:52:19
Shoot for the stars man. I've pictured this in my head for a long time. All coming together, and we have a few more tricks up our sleeve for the near future. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:22:55
Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:28:04
Thanks for reaching out. Duly noted.
@_date: 2013-06-17 03:01:16
I've never used Virtex but was thinking about it. What did you find frustrating about the site?
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:40:22
Wow, thanks for the offer. I will probably swing by Vancouver and Sunshine Coast as well as I hear they're trying to turn it into a BTC destination. I've been told they have a hostel, coffee shop and a few other stores accepting Bitcoin there. I've set September - October as the tentative time for the trip and I will definitely share my experiences with you.
@_date: 2013-05-03 02:51:38
That might be a good idea. Are frequent flyer miles transferable? Are you in Toronto?
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:12:58

Was in Barcelona last summer. Beautiful!
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:47:52
woot woot!
@_date: 2013-05-03 06:20:14
Too bad you can't make it. We might start making them more frequent considering the recent growth of the group. Stay tuned!
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:56:22
Thanks again!
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:59:19
haha. Maple Leaf (made in canada logo) = Toronto Maple Leafs :) Kinda obscure but I really didn't want to announce the location until right before the opening. The plan actually was to have people show up for the meetup and be surprised with the building and the ATM, however we didn't want to put up the sign on the day-of in case there were problems As soon as the sign went up this afternoon we knew the cat would be our of the bag. Its amazing how many people have stopped, tried to come in and taken pictures. It in an amazing location with awesome visibility for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-03 06:51:42
I'd also recommend taking a look at Walletbit. Hey PM me if you have any specific questions. I'd be glad to be of assistance in anyway I can. I've helped a few companies implementing Bitcoin payments.
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:38:35
Awesome! i'll check it out.
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:55:56
Awesome! 
@_date: 2013-10-10 14:19:56
Last week I helped out a panicked IT consultant from Manitoba, Canada who's car dealership customer's files were encrypted with this ransom-ware. The culprit was a supposed email from The Better Business Bureau stating that a customer had made a complaint against their company. Is this only affecting Canada? I shipped them 2 BTC to pay the time sensitive ransom. Then I had to ship them a bit more to cover the mining fee as it had to confirm ASAP.
The unlock codes were provided soon after.
Canadian Bitcoins - If victims call in for 2 BTC for the ransom make sure you advise them to get a fraction more to cover the mining fee.
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:41:47
Good luck on your venture! I'm making a database of all those that have responded with interest. I'll add you to it.
@_date: 2013-05-03 06:46:29
Welcome to the Matrix. Give your learning some time mate. There are tons of resources out there and you can hit me up with a private message if you'd like. I'll be glad to assist you on the journey.
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:52:26
The contract is online, so what? Do you know if any terms of the contract were broken? You seem to be crucifying one party when I'm sure you really don't know all the facts. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:07:27
All speculation at this point. 
@_date: 2013-10-10 14:30:29
Please change the headline! This is not a Bitcoin Virus. It is Ransomware that accepts BTC or MoneyPak as payment.
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:12:46
It's anonymous only if you choose it to be. I'm sure you're aware that many merchants accept Bitcoin and to do so they can't be anonymous.
