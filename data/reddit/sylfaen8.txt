I think their economists are telling them not to go too far on negative interest rates, as it could start bankruns (or maybe people just don't care to pay for lending their money to a bank). Will see, but interesting times 2019-2020 :)

No choice. They can not unplug it, it will freeze all the traditional markets and create a huge panic. Trying to avoid it to the infinite. I don't know what solution they will find, maybe buying shares of companies and other extraordinary tools as they can not go below on interest rates otherwise a bankrun will follow.

I trust more the swiss franc :). And between USD and Bitcoin, personally I prefer to be in Bitcoin despite short term volatility, as behind you have a decentralized uncensorable total transparent software with a monetary policy which is already predictable and fixed by consensus. Behind USD you have interesting things but not as interesting as Bitcoin I think.

Thank you for your interesting comment. This post also ignores the cold storage effect and people hodling as hard as possible as price starts breaking 20K again. Also he is confused about volume proxy, as it only represents bitcoin changing hands and not new bitcoins coming to exchanges.

Sir, volume doesn't equal quantity available, sir it just a determined quantity changing hands sir... also volume is a poor proxy, as we don't know if it is a correct measure...
And also do you think all the bitcoin mined are directly coming to exchanges? Nooo man, some people are hodling very hard, as the price starts breaking 20K again, people will hold as hard as possible and there will be only buyers left, millions bitcoins on cold storage, so price will skyrocket sir!

Agree, but Banks in Portugal are very greedy. For example in Switzerland a national transfer is free. Millenium to BPI has 1.20 eur of transfer fee. If you send money from a foreign country (with SEPA in EU) and you do an error in the data of the beneficiary, they return you the funds and take 40 eur from your account (It happenned to me). Outrageous as you said.
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:24:10
You have to look at it in a supply demand point of view. See it as a pool with water. If a lot of fishes are swimming there, volumes are high ok, but liquidity is low as the space between fishes is veey small( lot of fishes swimming in that pool). Well when all or majority of fishes swim in same direction (holders or buyers) , level of water in the pool  still high, but we say liquidity for buyers is low as only some fishes swim against it ( sellers). Is it better know?

@_date: 2019-04-09 07:52:44
I agree with you on the unit of account function you are describing + early medium of exchange. You have 3 main functions: medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value. We will see if Bitcoin plays a role as a store of value and maybe it could be seen as a fly to safety thing. A crash could be good for Bitcoin or bad...Gold also crashed initially in the last financial crises, so maybe you are right in the initial panic phase, if everything sells off and correlation goes to 1 everywhere. But the rebound after that could be huge, you know...
And please do not make comparisons between fiat State controlled central money and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-09 12:29:13
We even have philophers now, very interesting !!! Welcome !
Dollars are virtual my friend, 90% of the dollars money is scriptural and only virtual. But ok you can have paper. The intrinsic value of dollars paper is backed by a central bank and governements. Oups, but it is also 99% backed by trust. If you lose trust, dollars are only paper...which they are already...paper. Every day you are loosing purchasing power in dollars, because the current dollars monetary system works on debt and inflation. 
If you lose trust, you lose everything. Life is Trust. Trust is the Truth. (philosopher also ahaha)

24 years, you are lucky to live in a developed country with a stable currency maybe? We are over 7 Billion in the world, it is not just about you.
To say it loses 20% of its value, you are measuring it against USD?, therefore coupling it with another monetary system. The value of 1 bitcoin is 1 bitcoin to me -&gt; unit of account (+ medium of exchange and store of value in my opinion)
@_date: 2019-04-07 14:34:33
If everything is crashing down around you, you need water, food and guns + bunkers, it is all you need...Thanks God, we follow a positive evolution and progression through history...so the main and certain scenario is not the one you are describing.

Ahaha, have you studied money? Money has 3 functions...or are you redefining your own money concepts? :D. Your focus is on medium of exchange and unit of account, what do you do about store of value?
Bitcoin has huge usability for me, even if not all retailers in the world accept it...I don't agree about your analogy and that bitcoin is totally dependable on current money, even if it is important for the transition, but you know initially you need petrol to get out of petrol. You can not jump from one state of the world to another overnight. Sure current money and infrastructure are important, when everybody is happy and doing well everything is easy... Central banks will not let their money and the economy crash, so bottom line I am not such worried as you about the end of the world in a market crash which will crash Bitcoin. Short term events could have an important impact, but the trend and the change is there and not going away...

I do not agree. People who understand what really is, will keep it. Moreover, there is not a lot of people on it (versus stock market) comparing it to the stock market is not correct. You are comparing something which has 80T USD (stocks) with something which has 90B USD (bitcoin). True hodlers will not sell.

Ok I realize that I have to provide more details. It is a potential signal of recession (c.f Fed statement of yesterday, maybe a QE4). This chart represents the consumer future expectations relative to current conditions signaled by Conference Board. The spread between the Conference Board's current sentiment and expectations is one of the widest since March 2001, which was, for sure by coincidence ahaha, the first month of the U.S recession that year.
Given the bitcoin principles, I think it is in his favour, as explained in other comments here.

You are talking about a new digital gold with 10 years old, let's give him some time, don't you think so? Moreover, it is not palpable, which is even more difficult to believe in as gold for some people (prehistoric mean , has to be tangible and I have to see and touch it).
