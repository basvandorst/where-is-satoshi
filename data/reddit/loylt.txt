I'm wondering if the x axis might need a log scale now

You're doing it wrong... you still have some captain Morgan left

Yes... I do roughly this every paycheck... depositing my money and then waiting till a dip to actually buy
@_date: 2018-05-01 01:35:45
i don't even worry about what things will be that far in the future... heck, my crypto portfolio dove 5% in the last hour or so
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:23:09
Even if this is real there's nothing to stop you from someday just running off with the freely sent btc... use something enforceable like ethereum smart contracts
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:22:56
You can prolly sell them for 1 btc now

Most of this world's records are digital these days... a solar flaRE would even send the non crypts into financial distress... 
unless you really meant flair like you typed, in which case please explain w tf that is

With the volitility of bitcoin, I just can't rationalize using it as a payment method for anything right now... to do so would involve not only finding something you want to buy from a company that accepts bitcoin but also wait for a high in the bitcoin market so you can get the most value out of your bitcoin as you can... maybe in the far future when companies might possibly set a fixed btc cost for their products

So you're Mr. 85? I'm up to 93 now...

We're constantly going right... the x axis is time

Where's the GAME part of this game? It's just you charging space for people to make pixel art graffiti 
@_date: 2018-04-15 19:57:27
So you're saying the several you know aren't already part of the 100?

Saw something here a while back that Gemini want the username and password of your bank account.. is that true?

Dunno... what do you mean by "regulate the blockchain" ??
In the general sense of those words, no, not any better than a hacker could change block data
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:18:45
In short, bitcoin got forked
@_date: 2018-04-19 00:06:24
oh gee.. i pictured that... then the bitcoins that fell grew little drawn arms and legs and scattered
@_date: 2018-04-08 15:01:30
First... let's identify the types of btc thefts.... (1) random or brute force (2) malware compromised device (3) real life mugger or burglar
Now as long as I don't share my real info with anyone that knows I might have btc,  isn't interested in my btc... and  or  should be preventable with multi sig using multiple devices and hardware wallets, unless I'm thinking wrong
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:48:37
The coin in the picture you linked is labeled as 1 troy oz .999 copper... that would be worth about 20 cents
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:00:15
I heard of a site where you could submit programming requests like this but damn if I remember the name of the site
@_date: 2018-04-18 21:07:50
Someone stop them!! They're getting away with 2 boxes of bitcoins!!
@_date: 2018-04-21 05:41:26
You know you don't have to buy them in integral increments.... you can buy fractions
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:39:36
Question... can posts or comments on this so called social network be deleted or edited?
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:39:42
Of course he's kidding, but I'm not... "duffis"
@_date: 2018-04-06 00:09:59
How are they going to pull the coins out of my wallet and put them into a wallet 20 transactions ago? Aren't the transactions irreversible? Wouldn't they need my private key for the transfer?
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:48:33
Why the f would they need the username and password for my bank account?
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:13:17
That's probably the biggest issue... people know how to be people, but they don't know how to be banks.... so much security and redundancy necessary for that
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:42:28
I've heard it said option 2 (half the words here, half the words there) effectively reduces your security big-time if one location is compromised

Water, fire, ink, mold, pets, kids, .... and anything else you can think of.... keep away from all of them

Sounds right.... one brick of gold..... to back every us dollar.... let's hope two people don't ask for that 1 brick
@_date: 2018-04-18 21:52:21
Just take advantage of it and alternate buying and selling every hour while it's doing it
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:12:10
I count it similar to purchasing something of 0 value and all fee, on the rationale that the loss of that fractional share of a crypto-coin is entirely fee because I'm not directly getting anything of value from the transfer 
Example: I transferred some litecoin, fee was 0.000226 LTC ... I purchased that 0.000226 in a chunk that I paid 204.59/LTC for... so cost basis of 0.04623734 (I had no fee on the purchase, the larger chunk was a maker buy on gdax)... and at the time of the transfer the cost was 182.39/LTC... so sale subtotal before removing fees was 0.04122014 ...taking that entire value as a fee, my sale proceeds are 0,... for a recorded gain (sale proceeds minus cost basis) of -0.04623734 USD, or in other words a recorded loss of 4 cents

Isn't this sort of thing against the terms of service for most exchanges? And if it was done on the stock market wouldn't this stuff be illegal?
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:29:33
Ahh, the run of the bulls
@_date: 2018-04-19 01:03:08
So the bitcoins are both there and not there at the same time?
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:02:49
Might be a problem with your mobile devices or the dns servers they're using... my devices pull up cmc just fine
@_date: 2018-04-27 02:03:36
If I remember, I think it's based on the number of inputs needed to create your output.... if one person sends you 1 btc, then you send 1 btc to someone... that transaction would be cheaper than sending out 1 btc that came from 100 people sending you 0.01 btc
@_date: 2018-04-21 13:58:49
2 halves make a whole though.... and most exchanges will let you buy as small as 0.001 btc at a time... budget as much of your disposable income as you can each paycheck and eventually you will have your one
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:47:53
That makes for a very dangerous social network... people need to be able to edit or delete their hastily typed thoughts

if you want morning pizza you buy the night before anyway

looks like we didn't win... someone beat both of us
unless there's more bitcoin to gain from this app, i guess i'll be deleting it.... i don't mind doing logic puzzles like this, but 220 of them for no reason? my ADHD kicked in around 60... had to keep telling myself there was roughly $1700 USD to gain.... but now...

Wheres the quiz?
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:53:28
Dude... if prices go up when you're not looking, just buy some and don't look.... you'll already make money from not looking so why bum money off the rest of us?

Someone must've eaten the bread and found your wallet in it
Seriously though... Looking at the transaction history it happened 6 days after you put it in.... is it possible malware on your computer last year captured your wallet info?
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:25:08
Or simply decided to turn evil
