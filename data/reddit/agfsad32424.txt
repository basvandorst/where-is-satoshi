Yea.. but maybe not so bad.. one transfer from your corp account to fidor and then one transfer to kraken and then a trade and a withdrawal of BTC.
I doubt you will find anywhere that works with your debit card for less than around 3%. 
To use bank wires you will need a corporate bitcoin exchange account which I predict will be a major hassle to setup.. basically all the passport and utility bill scans you need for a personal account but also for other company officers instead of just you and also all the corporate certificate of incorporation stuff. Once setup you'll basically be using either SWIFT or P2P trading like localbitcoins or coinfloor's marketplace. Both options have fees.. probably a £10-25 transaction fee in the case of SWIFT and maybe 3-4% for P2P options.
I would point out that transferwise.com can send to south africa and would probably be much easier and maybe even cheaper than any of these options :/

There probably isn't any good way to do what you want. Maybe uphold.com (which takes debit cards) would work.. but most likely you're best off buying the coin and reimbursing yourself.. I recommend opening a personal  smart current account and using it with kraken.com, bitstamp.com or zyado.com. You'll still have the GBP-&gt;EUR-&gt;BTC-&gt;ZAR chain, but fidorbank hardly charges anything for the GBP-&gt;EUR part.. (currently fidor offering 1.1733 EUR per GBP and xe.com rate is showing 1.17336) and they only charge £2.49 for a SEPA transfer to send to the exchange.
As for localbitcoins, perhaps you could use paym or barclays pingit to accelerate localbitcoins settlements.. although buying from corporate accounts is probably going to be problematic.

The best way is to not trade in GBP. Get an account at  which allows SEPA transfers for £2.49 - then you can trade on kraken.com, bitstamp.net or zyado.com and other EUR venues (but those three are the largest). Fidor charges hardly anything to convert GBP to EUR and there is no deposit fee for EUR on those exchanges so you're transferring almost all the value.

Maybe it will pass after it's been proved on litecoin.. I doubt it will happen before that.

if by recently you mean many years ago..
@_date: 2017-01-28 18:15:25
transferwise is around 0.5% usually and there's only one conversion instead of two.

Yes.. the thought did cross my mind that maybe a 'basic bank account' might be less susceptible to closure too.. if the tsb cash account really does allow free GBP swift transfers to Europe then I strongly suspect that feature was surreptitiously added for the benefit of bitcoin users.

Yea.. well all blockchains are currently just a layer in front of some other database.. leveldb in the case of bitcoin.. bdb, h2, mongodb etc are all used in various blockchain projects.
If it becomes popular to do so, I can imagine database providers may well make sure that their databases are compatible with one or more blockchain layers.. perhaps as time goes on those might become more integrated with the database.. or even be written as plugin/extensions or using built in scripting languages such as plsql.. it could happen :p

Prepaid cards are more or less useless. The first step would be to go to a normal ATM, and withdraw all the cash from the prepaid card ;) Then use a cash deposit on localbitcoins.com or libertyx.com.

Sure.. but they've actually made the cash account better than their more expensive retail accounts by having free GBP transfers to europe.. no other bank accounts have that feature.. sure you can transfer money to europe, but it isn't free - typicall they charge from £10-£25 per transfer. It's strange and tbh mostly useless other than for buying bitcoin.. how many people have GBP denominated bank accounts in Europe? Hardly anyone is my guess. The other thing that's interesting about the tsb cash account is that it's available to non-residents.. so people in the EU can get it and use it to sell BTC on UK localbitcoins for GBP. Sure in theory any account can be held by a non-resident, but the cash account actually advertises that it's available for (non-UK) EU residents and details how to apply.

could be.. but maybe just attempting email addresses from some other hack.

while I would definitely recommend getting a firdor bank account to buy btc on kraken for instance.. it is not useful for selling on localbitcoins as inward faster payments transfers are incredibly slow (like next day sometimes) - your customers will want near instant release of their BTC so you will need accounts at the main highstreet banks that can process faster payments in near real time. Fidor to fidor payments are instant, but if someone has a fidor account they'd probably just buy on kraken instead of dealing with you.
Another option you might want to consider is the tsb.co.uk cash account - it's a basic bank account that anyone can get and also appears to have the benefit of being able to send free GBP SWIFT transfers to europe.. if this is ture, this would allow you to move GBP into coinfloor.co.uk for £5 per transfer which is pretty good.. like comparable to the fidor to kraken route.. but it's all in GBP which is handy and also I imaigne tsb cash account faster payments are probably quite fast.. this is all untested though.. if you try it and it works out would be nice to mention it on @_date: 2017-01-25 00:14:08
Sure, just buy it from your mother.

well the vpn is probably also a honey pot but yea i don't think it matters if you mix them or not for that.
@_date: 2017-01-29 19:25:57
Perhaps the main difference is having records controlled by private key instead of by username/password db credentials.. no doubt something similar could be rigged up with a traditional db though.. maybe DBAs will eventually start using blockchain patterns when designing their dbs. bigchaindb could be a step in that direction.

Argentina got rid of their currency controls so there isn't much of a rate difference anymore.

They're probably all honey pots.. bitmixer.io is cloudflare fronted which means cf can see the output address. CF is basically a security company. Security companies work for the government.
The bitmixer code system is hilarious.. get you to voluntarily link all your transactions together just in case you might have accidentally managed to get to their site from an unlinked IP address and using coins that weren't tainted from any of your previous transactions.
What's a better mixer then you ask? There's no way to know, but probably none of them.

Looks neat, only seems to support US and Philippine bank accounts.. and no tellers around yet either.
