This. This is what I was looking for.

Yeah I'm foolishly benchmarking against the $19k ��
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:46:49
I agree. But it's so easy to benchmark against the recent peak haha

Noob to the community here. Can you define FUD please?
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:55:20
Yup. Got that. Hence the bad sarcasm. I need sleep.

Where I could say how much of what I have in my wallet(s) and it would tell me in dollars what I have.

Thank you dude!

You're missing the point dude. Just because I can turn on the light switches manually, that doesn't mean I don't enjoy automating them. I was going to write myself an app to save myself a few seconds but thought I would see what is out there first.

Hyper inflation is bad for sure. My dad lived through hyper inflation in Bolivia. But I still wouldn't consider regular rates of inflation as theft
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:04:58
It is because of people like me? People who want to fully adopt Bitcoin and move away from Fiat make Bolivia the way it is? People who ask others to elaborate on their perspectives?

Careful there buddy. Just because economics was a large part of my college curriculum, that doesn't mean I accept everything taught blindly. 
There are a few things I have observed since I asked for perspective on inflation:
1. People like me who ask for elaboration will have many assumptions made about them.
2. Many of those responding could benefit from answering in a non-patronizing way. We talk about addition being necessary but then we carry out a discussion in a way that will turn away more potential adopters than it will attract.
3. Many of those responding to me appear to be angry at the fact that this game of Life has some rules-such as inflation-that work against many while working in favor of others. I prefer to play by today's set of rules instead of whining about them, while working together to change them.

Hold up. I'm on board with what Bitcoin stands for and share this community's vision, but tell me how inflation is theft. I don't agree but I am sincerely interested in your point of view.
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:15:55
The extremes scare me haha. While I can't say I'm at the point where I will make blanket statements like that, I still try to understand others' points of view with a willingness to change my mind is presented with good arguments. But what I thought was a reasonable approach to this discussion already got me called a terrible person.

I would say "evidence" instead of proof but awesome results nevertheless!
