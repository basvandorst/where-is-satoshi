Reddit should add a quarkcointip function.  It would work just like bitcointip,  except people only get tipped for stupid comments.

Be honest.  You had to look up the correct spelling for "paraphernalia", right?

I've never tried it, but supposedly you can import a wallet into blockchain.info.

That doesn't look bad at all.  I was concerned about the flash chip itself being damaged.  It looks fine from the pic.
Looks like just the USB connector got broken off.
It's actually a pretty easy fix if there is no hidden damage.  Just 4 wires to solder. 
Actually, you can probably fix it yourself long enough to get the data off of it without having to solder.
Simply hack up an unused USB cable and connect the correct leads to the pads on the PCB and secure them with electrical tape.  It might take a little patience, but it should work long enough to copy the files.

If you click on the receive tab, it will have a section for the imported keys.  The public keys are all listed there.
Then you can go to wallet-&gt;private keys-&gt;export and it will create a .csv file with both the public and private keys.

Depends on how he installed it.
Did he just upgrade a previous version or did he overwrite the partition doing a clean install?
If it was an upgrade, the file is probably still there (not even deleted).
If it was a clean install, depending on where the file was physically located on the disk, it may or may not have been overwritten.

If 7zip did not exist.... maybe. But probably not.  I don't like to pay for stuff.

Yeah. Just go ahead and move them [here]( but ONLY if you can crack *my* algorithm.

I'd return it, too.  But before I did I'd leave it in my wallet for a bit just to stare in awe at it.

Does it take you a long time to extract your key?
