Why not both? Bitcoin has been a successful get-rich quick scheme for some.
@_date: 2019-11-15 20:42:52
Good talk.
@_date: 2019-11-15 20:17:47
So answer me this. What is stopping people like you and me from buying Bitcoin today based on the information that the halving is coming? If people have already bought based on this information, then it is priced in. You are still wrong.
@_date: 2019-11-19 14:59:08


I wouldn't consider having $17 million in your pocket rekt. But I could definitely see a scenario where the miner is salty if Bitcoin moons shortly after his dump. I'm sure he could use some of his money to make himself feel better though.
@_date: 2019-11-15 20:37:16
The information is not meaningless. The information itself is what is priced in. People have bought based on this information. That is why it is priced in.
@_date: 2019-11-19 15:09:44
I think you have a point. It's better to say that 'Past performance does not guarantee future results'. Nobody can see the future. Nobody has a time machine. And at the end of the day, we are all just making educated (and uneducated) guesses.
@_date: 2019-11-15 20:40:45
That's fine. But the information is still priced in. As for the price performance itself, it sounds like you are speculating unless you have a time machine.
@_date: 2019-11-19 15:13:41
If you believe in Bitcoin long-term, than this is a very solid strategy. You will continue to accumulate more and more Bitcoin and eventually your strategy will pay off if your hunch is correct.
@_date: 2019-11-15 20:11:29
You are wrong. People have already bought Bitcoin in anticipation of the next halvening. It's priced in buddy.
@_date: 2019-11-19 20:10:46
You bring up good points. But how can these be prevented without regulating Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:35:38
In that case, no. But it's also possible that he did not spend that much money on his mining operation and he made out just fine. At the end of the day, we are both just speculating.
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:05:40
No, these links should do. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-10-31 18:09:09
That's fair. I wouldn't say I'm ready to completely leave Fiat since it's been working for so long, but I'm definitely hedging my bets by diversifying with Bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:44:50
There should be a balance between risk and reward. Higher risk investments should have higher reward and lower risk investments should have lower reward. So the point of taking risks in investing is to attain a higher possible reward.
@_date: 2019-10-30 16:45:30
Yes, in retrospect investing in Bitcoin 10 years ago was the right choice. But past performance does not guarantee future results. It did not then and still applies today unless you can see into the future.
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:04:12
I don't see why it couldn't happen to Facebook.
@_date: 2019-10-30 15:52:29
What's a general delusional belief held by the users on r/personalfinance? I lurk that board frequently and what I mostly see is sound financial advice which people have been successfully following for decades.
@_date: 2019-10-30 21:02:07
Right. That's why I think it is reasonable to avoid Bitcoin in scenarios where one wishes to minimize risks, such as the investment of their child's college tuition.
@_date: 2019-10-30 18:12:19
"There are always exceptions that break the rule. My argument was never 100% of subscribers lack BTC either. What percentage of users in r/personalfinance do you think own any BTC?"
What is your argument then? If you're implying that a majority of them don't own Bitcoin, that's fair, but your statements sound absolute, as if you are certain. I don't know how many users on r/personalfinance own Bitcoin, and it appears that neither do you. I don't wish to guess either. 
"Neither of us do , but from the posts and topics created and conversations that go on there you can tell at least half of them have 100% stocks"
I can't tell actually. But even if I consider your educated guess that at least 50% of r/personalfinance users are 100% invested in stocks, all that means is that those users have a higher risk tolerance. There's nothing inherently wrong in investing 100% of your portfolio in stocks if it's in line with your risk tolerance. Just like there's nothing wrong with investing 100% of your portfolio in Bitcoin if you are fully aware of the risks and have a very high risk tolerance.
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:29:11
I can't speak for people who trash-talk Bitcoin. I have nothing against it. But even if someone went all in on the S&amp;P 500 (100% stock portfolio) the moment prior to the 2008 financial crisis, they would be up around 7.8%/year.
I wouldn't call that person irrational whether they disliked Bitcoin or not.
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:39:12
By having all Bitcoin owners liquidate and the demand for Bitcoin disappearing entirely. Highly unlikely, but possible.
@_date: 2019-10-30 17:42:23
Bitcoin could also crash 100 times over and then go to 0. My point is that you can't see the future and Bitcoin remains an investment too risky to gamble the education of your child on. Now if this poster had extra play money laying around, I'm all for them throwing that at Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:44:43
Any sources on that? I'd like to learn more regarding the risk calculations of Bitcoin and how it factors into the overall risk of my portfolio.
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:37:09
That's fine and all. I hope that the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin continues upward as I also have a stake in it. But we simply don't know if that will be the case. Do you think that Bitcoin will overtake Fiat anytime soon? Purchasing power is just one of the factors that makes a currency strong. Stability is another very important factor. I think it is safe to say that Bitcoin is not the most stable currency out there.
@_date: 2019-10-30 17:52:20
Do you know this for a fact? Have you seen the portfolio of all r/personalfinance users? Have you conducted a survey of r/personalfinance users and then ran a statistical analysis against the results in order to determine the average portfolio distribution? Do you know how many of them own gold or bonds? Because I don't. I for one would consider myself part of their community, yet my portfolio contains Bitcoin and is diverse. I guess there goes your argument.
@_date: 2019-10-30 17:26:36
I haven't heard anyone on r/personalfinance outright promote a non-diverse portfolio. I've only heard the opposite actually. I can't speak to the portfolio's of their users, but the advice I generally hear is that one should diversify their portfolio in order to mitigate risks.
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:09:11
"I use %s and qualifiers ... very far from absolutes"
Many presumptions were made on your part, yet you spoke as if they were factual or absolutes.


It doesn't actually sound like you know that the users are actively avoiding Bitcoin, and I have not seen evidence to suggest this.


No evidence that the average user has an unbalanced portfolio yet it was stated as fact.
"Disagree. Investing 100% of ones portfolio in Bitcoin is crazy and worse than 100% stocks."
It is crazy and more risky than stocks. I've never argued otherwise. As I said before, if someone is aware of the risks, I'm fine with it. There are people who took a calculated risk, invested 100% of their portfolio into Bitcoin and are now rich. I would say things worked out for them. My issue is when people invest into Bitcoin thinking everything is sunshine and rainbows and that it will definitely go up.
"Than they also should invest in Bitcoin because it has a larger potential upside and decreases their risk"
I have nothing against investing into Bitcoin, and I think it is safe to say that there are r/personalfinance users which also have no issues with this, such as I.
@_date: 2019-10-30 17:14:21
In retrospect, buying Bitcoin 10 years was the correct choice. But past performance does not guarantee future results. And I would frequent any source of sound financial advice regardless of whether I invested in Bitcoin a decade ago or not...
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:55:45
I don't think Fiat would work without the backing of a government at all actually.
@_date: 2019-10-30 17:03:39
I see nothing delusional about that post at all. Bitcoin was mentioned in passing as a joke. And even if the poster was seriously considering it, I would argue that it's not smart to invest all of your child's savings into bitcoin. What are you going to tell little Timmy in 18 years when he's ready to go to college if Bitcoin crashes? "Tough luck, we gambled your education"? On the other hand, if Bitcoin moons then Timmy can have a few lambo's, but unfortunately neither you nor I can see into the future.
@_date: 2019-12-06 15:10:59


Not all FIAT transactions are in cash. And if you are making a cash transaction, then it cannot be done across the world. Bitcoin allows untraceable transactions across the world, unlike cash transactions. Nice try.


Or you can just execute a Bitcoin transaction instead of doing all that work...




So you agree that it is possible to remain anonymous while using Bitcoin... Cool.


Because it provides utility. Believe it or not, but some people like anonymity. I know. Shocking.


Wrong. I know it must blow your mind, but people can want anonymity without doing something illegal. Not knowing something so basic makes me fear for your mental state.


Wrong. There are cameras. A receipt was produced. Witnesses saw you make the cash transaction. And FIAT is definitely not decentralized. Try again.
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:27:09
* Decentralized currency not controlled or regulated by a government or central authority
* Possibility of anonymous use depending on how careful a user is
* A hedge against FIAT
* Speculation
I believe that these are legitimate use-cases and actual reasons that plenty of people use Bitcoin. Implying that Bitcoin has no actual utility is disingenuous.
@_date: 2019-12-12 14:56:07
I know. Shocking, right?
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:01:22
The goal wasn't to provide unique examples. Something's utility is not defined by whether those utilities are unique or not. You asked what utility Bitcoin offered, and I provided real-life use-cases for Bitcoin. Unless you can actually give me reasons why you don't consider any of those examples legitimate utilities for Bitcoin, it seems like you have failed.
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:09:21
Just a bunch of assumptions.
@_date: 2019-12-06 16:40:32


So you believe that Fiat is decentralized, which is patently false. And you also believe that Fiat is untraceable, which is also patently false. Good to know.
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:22:19


Not really. I believe that decentralized cryptocurrencies in general provide a unique utility. Bitcoin just so happens to be the most widely adopted cryptocurrency out there.
@_date: 2019-12-12 14:07:22
Just because the supply of something is limited doesn't mean that the demand for it will be high.
@_date: 2019-12-05 19:03:45
Why are you looking for a utility that is unique to Bitcoin? You are assuming that a utility needs to be unique in order to be useful, which is not the case at all. Multiple companies make hammers, hammers are not unique, yet each hammer has utility. It is useful. You can do something with it. I stand by my original argument. You implied that Bitcoin had no utility, then I gave you reasons that people use Bitcoin. Proving its utility. Your prerequisite for 'uniqueness' is completely irrelevant to my original statement. Let me know when you are prepared to challenge Bitcoin's actual utility.
@_date: 2019-12-06 00:55:15
Believe it or not, but words have definitions.
Decentralized does mean something.
The advantage of a decentralized cryptocurrency is that it is not beholden to a central authority and puts the control of the currency completely in the hands of its owners. On top of that, anonymous transactions can be executed across the entire world. If you honestly believe that the exact same things that can be accomplished with crypto can be accomplished with gold, then that's all I need to know. If you don't actually believe that, then you are arguing in bad faith. Either way, it's not looking good for you buddy.
@_date: 2019-12-06 13:59:37


Not while retaining anonymity. Anytime you make a transaction involving cash, it is easily traceable back to you.


Anonymous in the sense that it cannot be traced back to the user. Bitcoin just uses a bunch of keys and texts for transactions, none of which link back to a user who has been careful and has not exposed their keys.


I'm not saying that at all. I've already explained to you the advantages of a currency being decentralized, but clearly you either do not care or do not want to care. I commend you too research the advantages on your own. Hopefully you will learn something.
