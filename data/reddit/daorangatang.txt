Did you actually read the link I sent you? There's a section for digital currency and fiat currency. Under digital currency, which includes bitcoin, it says the following: 
"All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result."
"The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft. The policy is provided by a syndicate of insurers through Lloyd’s of London." 
- Also, as a practical matter 99% of individual investors of bitcoin will not have more than $250k in bitcoin.

What's the difference between data security of medical records via HIPPA and data security of medical records via the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:34:22
Actually Coinbase is insured: 
Their insurance "policy is provided by a syndicate of insurers through Lloyd’s of London."
Moreover, if you are a United States resident, your Coinbase USD Wallet is covered by FDIC insurance, up to a maximum of $250,000.
I am considering moving my funds from my Trezor to GDAX and now I have some peace of mind knowing that even if Coinbase gets hacked, like Mt. Gox, I will get my money back.

You have aces in the pocket. Why are you hesitant on going all-n? 
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:33:50
And because Coinbase and GDAX are the same company, this applies to coins on GDAX as well correct?

What do you use instead of coin base now?

Given the unlikelihood of the ETF, I wonder if the market already has this priced in. In other words, we shouldn't expect to see a significant drop (perhaps less than 5%) when the SEC denies the ETF.

I sold at 960 then bought at 980 because of those experts :(

If it doesn't, then use your best judgment. No one can predict the market.
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:09:10
Wondering the same thing.
@_date: 2017-02-19 15:15:40
Over simplistic. There are several factors that will determine the approval of the ETF. Falling GBTC is not indicative of an ETF approval.

"The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft. The policy is provided by a syndicate of insurers through Lloyd’s of London." 
Even if their hardware gets hacked, we would be insured. Also, can you provide sources of their numerous claims?

Does coinbase or any other exchange for that matter insure users bitcoins up to a certain amount? 
@_date: 2017-02-11 16:43:36
@_date: 2017-02-14 02:50:43
How will this effect the price of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-02-05 05:40:41
What are the things you dislike about coinbase? I use them for all my transactions and dislike their fees. I haven't found a suitable replacement though
@_date: 2017-02-03 16:40:03
So if coinbase were to get hacked, all the users whose coins were on coinbase would be out of luck?
@_date: 2017-02-11 16:44:02
@_date: 2017-02-15 17:46:30
Yes, all bitcoin are now closed to the public. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 20:27:33
Yeah, I have all my coins stored on my Trezor. I also use Mycellium with my Trezor and it's super nice. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 22:40:59
I've considered that, however, I estimate I would probably be able to only pull in about $50usd/mos profit. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 06:00:15
Coins are fdic insured on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-02-21 00:45:51
AH this increase was due to insider speculation that the ETF will be approved. Better buy now because after the approval the price is going to $3k+

"If you are a United States resident, your Coinbase USD Wallet is covered by FDIC insurance, up to a maximum of $250,000."

Buy when the price dips after the ETF get denied.

The more Friedman I am exposed to, the more I move to the right. His ideas are very logically sound. I also try to relate his ideas to bitcoin as there are many similarities between a decentralized system such as bitcoin and a decentralized government. MF is right when he says "power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."

"The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security ..." I read physical security to include their offline devices that hold they keys

Why is that? 
@_date: 2017-02-12 21:09:05
That's a good idea.

"It would behoove Japan, as host of the 2020 summer Olympics, to cater to foreigners paying in bitcoin."

Yes there is a public ledger (i.e. the blockchain) but how will the IRS pin a public address on an individual when public addresses continually change? I guess if one were to liquidate their coins for fiat, then the IRS could track capital gains but if one were to just spend their earnings using the bitcoin itself, I don't see how the IRS could track that.
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:04:31
Why would anyone report their gains, even if such a software was created, if their transactions are anonymous and thus, the IRS has no way of identifying how much capital gains you've earned? The article presumes that people want to report their earnings to the IRS. Am I missing something here?

Can someone explain to me what segwit is?

The first lecture went completely over my head. I think some CS background is required to understand the concepts.

A settlement is not indicative of guilt. Considering this is a very sensitive issue emotion potentially involving children, BP rightfully does not want to have a jury trial. The jury would be easily swayed by the emotional arguments. So I don't think it's fair to extrapolate guilt from a settlement.

I don't see much value in the Trezor2. They should work on creating a new product instead of reinventing the wheel.

Can you explain in more detail what you mean by this? And give examples of future Litecoin transaction vs future Bitcoin transactions.
