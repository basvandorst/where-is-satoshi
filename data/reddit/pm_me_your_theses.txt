Hey, I sympathize and agree with you on the inflation thing. I’m just saying, it’s bad everywhere.
@_date: 2019-07-25 07:25:53
If bitcoin reaches 1 million, you have barely captured enough savers to equal the American gold and government-bond market. You still have space to capture the European, Japanese, and Chinese gold and government-bond markets, not to mention other types of bond markets and other types of metal savings (silver, platinum, etc...) around the globe. Plus, other assets, like art.
Yes, there will be a point when it will be meaningless to compare bitcoin to fiat, but $1 million USD per BTC is not it. It's much, much higher.

\&gt; Gold’s utility as a monetary instrument derives from its **scarcity**. 
In part. That scarcity provides "limited supply", which is one of the characteristics of money. The others are durability, portability, divisibility, uniformity, and acceptability.
Does gold have those characteristics? Yes! because it doesn't rust easily, it is durable. Because it is a malleable metal, it can be broken into pieces or cast into coins, so it is both portable and divisible. Because it is an element, its properties don't change and thus it's uniform, and because its properties are easy to identify, it can become acceptable as currency.
All of these are properties that make it good money, because money needs to be (1) a store of value, (2) a unit of account, and (3) a medium of exchange. You can't store value in something that doesn't last and isn't uniform. You can't use something as a unit of account if it isn't divisible, and you can't use it as a medium of exchange if there is no portability and acceptability. All of these characteristics make gold good money. Gold isn't "backed" by anything other than the presence of these characteristics.
Are these characteristics present in bitcoin? Yes! Yes they are.
Bitcoin is scarce by design. It is also durable as they can be stored in cold storage for centuries if needed. It is divisible in Satoshis and microsatoshis. It is uniform and has well known properties. And it can be accepted by anyone with a bitcoin wallet and proof of work. Again, Bitcoin exhibits all of the properties of money, and in fact it is modeled to be a form of "virtual gold" in that it has all of the properties of gold that make gold good money. Thus, bitcoin is as good money as gold. 
That's why bitcoin has value, and why it will continue to expand its popularity as an asset class.

This is what I don't understand. Regulation can be a good thing. Not too long ago everyone was saying that crypto, ICOs, and shitcoins were all incredibly risky due to lack of oversight and the ease to commit fraud. With regulation, that ease disappears and oversight becomes a reality. More established coins like bitcoin which enjoy a 10-year-old, mature, trading environment are the least to be affected by crypto regulation. Thus, bitcoin is probably going to be a lot more attractive to investors after Washington regulates crypto (compared to other coins).
So why the fear? Do they actually fear that the US Congress is gonna outlaw an asset worth over 174 Billion USD and daily trading volumes of over 23 billion USD? That's ridiculous!

It's terrifying, but not because it's digital or anything. The death of fiat will also be the death of government-directed inflation, or Keynesianism. Keynesianism is not without faults, but it did help America and the UK, and eventually the world, recover from the Depression and from the devastation of WWII. Inflation still is the best tool to incentivize spending and investment over hoarding, and that in turn is still the best tool to motivate employment, which brings social peace. 
Of course, bitcoin has other advantages that will improve society as well. And society can evolve over time too... Let's see what the future brings us.

You can prevent a bank run, but you cannot prevent a currency run, even with help from the IMF or the BIS. And, usually, IMF and BIS help comes with a price tag, unless you are the United States, of course.
Bitcoin was designed to work in the opposite fashion, which should mean that it is strong and stable. But it turns out, it has been the opposite of that: volatile and fickle. This is why bank runs occur. If the price of bitcoin was immune to inflation (or negative inflation, also called "deflation") as it was supposed to, then we'd be singing a different tune.

Coinbase is not a marketplace, it's a bank. When the bank doesn't allow you to withdraw it's because it's having a run. Bankruns trigger panic, which in turn trigger bigger crashes. Because crashes are self-fulfilling prophecies. 
Coinbase doing this is actually a smart thing and it's what most countries do when having a run on their currency. It'll slow the downward spiral, and hopefully make investors breathe and realize that nothing has changed. Bitcoin is worth just as much now as 5 days ago, as 4 years ago.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:18:58
They absolutely do. My comment is a criticism on crypto banks. Coinbase is doing a "smart thing", for them, because they're exposed to bitcoin by the billions. 
To be absolutely clear, a crash is irrational result of a bubble, which is  the irrational result of exuberance, which is the irrational result of facilitators to entry (middlemen). Cryptobanks like Coinbase caused the exuberance. Coinbase itself maybe did not do this (at least I didn't see them doing it), but other trading platforms were advertising on Facebook and Google promises of great price gains if potential customers made deposits on their bitcoin platforms. If that isn't "pump and dump", I don't know what is. But Bitcoin is not a "pump and dump" asset, just that banks behaved in a "pump and dump" fashion.

I am not comparing Bitcoin to companies like Google. I’m comparing it to the Internet. And just like the Internet needed Google, and Facebook, and Netflix, and Amazon, and Skype, and many many many more companies to create a digital economy, Bitcoin needs a Bitcoin-economy led by companies who accept bitcoin as payment, or do some other awesome thing with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:23:40
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It's value is derived exclusively from supply and demand. Money supply has increased, but the theoretical limit is unchanged (about 20 million BTC). Money demand has increased, but only speculatively. The bitcoin economy (that is, goods and services traded in bitcoin) hasn't changed all that much. Unless that part of the economy is developed, it won't either. And a big hurdle is transaction costs. Another hurdle was awareness, but I think we can safely say that Bitcoin has cleared that hurdle. Even Wall Street is taking bitcoin seriously now.
This is a bubble, and bubbles crash. But it won't be the end of bitcoin. After the dust settles, the real growth will come. Same with the dotcom bubble. Only after it burst did the Googles and Facebooks of the world emerged to conquer it.
@_date: 2018-09-30 05:41:48
Are you kidding me?
Quantitative Easing was a RESPONSE to the end of the housing bubble. So the housing bubble wasn’t caused by QE (the topic of conversation). Not only that, but Janet Yellen wasn’t Fed Chairman at the time!
And no, the bubble it wasn’t caused by inflation either. It was caused by low interest rates combined with lack of regulation in the financial sector. 
As for “asset inflation”, this is from the Wikipedia page:


Also, talking about “Asset Inflation” in a bitcoin forum is, frankly, laughable.

When did she say that?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:21:02
One the one hand, yes. But reduced volume may also produce a rebound in price. 
For example, Bitcoin price at 10:00AM EST this morning was at about $11,500. Right now (around 4:20PM EST), it's about $14,200. That is a huge gain. That may restore optimism.
It is also an indicator of intervention, which is the 2nd tool that fiat currencies use in the event of a currency run. How, exactly, did Coinbase in particular, or the Bitcoin community in general intervened should raise a lot of eyebrows.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:31:11
Here are my theories:
1. Bitcoin-casuals are taking their profits. This is less a panic than a market correction. It will end soon and then there will be stability, hopefully more growth.
2. People are reacting to the Youbit news yesterday.
3. I agree that Coinbase and BCH aren't a factor. Most people don't know the difference and for most people there is a hurdle against moving from BTC to BCH.
4. Futures trading is pushing for stability and that means lower volumes from people looking to buy.

This is why you're wrong:
1. A crash is not a temporary decrease in price, but a sudden change in vector that becomes long term downwardly trend. You said bitcoin was going to crash, and there is not enough information to say that it has crashed. If it keeps going down for 6 months, then you'd be right. But since it's more likely that there will be a correction in 4 or 5 days, you're wrong.
2. A bull run doesn't mean that the price never goes down. A bull run means that over the course of a long period of time (6, 12, 18, 24, or more months) the price tends to climb. Occasionally, it will go down, but it will continue to go up shortly after. The price of bitcoin is still 3 times over what it was in March of this year. The bull run hasn't ended.
3. Saying you're wrong is not an insult. We all make mistakes. If you think you don't make mistakes, you're deluded. Saying you made a mistake is not an insult, but an observation. Admitting a mistake is a sign of maturity.

Currently, Bitcoin is very far away from fulfilling its promise. It is used almost exclusively as a speculative asset. It isn’t used as a currency for trade and it won’t be used as such until two things happen:
1. Volatility ends
2. Transaction fees are reigned in.
The transaction fee problem has been discussed previously and I believe Bitcoin is close to finding a solution.
But volatility will end when supply and demand are stable, and to me, that means that Bitcoin graduates from being a speculative asset and becomes a boring, old-fashioned, slow growth, “safe” asset. In order to that, a “magic number” must be achieved. 
In my opinion, that magic number is 1 Trillion.
1 Trillion Dollars in Bitcoin Market Cap is what’s needed to get money supply and market demand in equilibrium. Why? Because 1 Trillion dollars represents 5% of US Debt. My assumption is that the 20T in debt in the US is held by bond investors, who invested in the government bond market to find safety. If 5% of that amount is invested in Bitcoin, it will become safe.
Current market cap for Bitcoin is north of $250 Billion. This means that Bitcoin is already equivalent to 1% of the US government debt market. This is why Wall Street is now taking it seriously. 
Incidentally, if you consider that the Bitcoin supply limit is 20 million BTC, then at a 1 Trillion market cap, it would mean that the fair value of 1 Bitcoin is $50,000 USD. There is room for price growth speculating (if that’s what you’re interested in)...

My comment was the question: "When did Janet Yellen say that"?
The answer was "I don't know, during a QE hearing", or something to that effect.
QE was a response to the financial crisis, and the 10 years following the financial crisis where the times with the lowest inflation since the Great Depression. There's data to that effect, it's not an opinion. So, I'm just merely remarking that it is so. That the entire implicit argument makes NO SENSE. 
So, yeah, I understand you took exception to me questioning the lack of sense of this idea that "government == inflation all the time". But there are facts that back me up.
And if you want to have the "broader conversation", I'm up for it.
Now, I'm here because I, too, believe that bitcoin can do a lot of good. But nothing is perfect. Bitcoin is not a magic wand, a cure-all pill, or a universal solution to all economic problems. In fact, bitcoin may solve old problems, but it is sure to create brand new ones too. Same goes for government and fiat currency: not everything about it is bad, and inflation is not always bad either. So, if you're willing to talk like adults that are capable of nuance, I'm up for that broader discussion.
Have a nice day.

2. As long as the economy returns higher yields than inflation, you’re fine. The US economy grew 4.5%, and inflation is at 4.1%. That’s a 0.4% growth in real terms. It’s not much, but inflation is clearly not the one robbing you anything. If you invested in US treasury bonds instead of bitcoin on Jan 1st 2018, you’d be better off today.

The Federal Reserve absolutely controls interest rates. I'm talking exclusively about the interest rates that banks are charged by the Fed to create money. It's a common theme around here that banks "can create money out of thin air". I'm surprised more people don't know how this is done, and how "out of thin air" really means "out of a mandate from the Fed and at a Fed-fixed interest rate". In fact, in the US, only the Fed can create money out of thin air, and it's done through several monetary policy tools, of which the most common is the interest rate.


Yes, between independent lenders and borrowers. But banks are a special kind of lender that are heavily regulated in regards to interest rates, and though they can borrow between themselves, there is a lender of last resort, which is the US Federal Reserve. It is the Fed Interest Rate which I'm talking about, and which defines other interest rates.
In fact, reference rates are also common, such as the LIBOR rates. So understanding reference rates and central bank rates helps in economic forecasting.


Yes, but that's not at all what I meant. If you understand fractionary banking, then you understand that spending X creates x^n amount of money. The "n" is defined by the Fed's policies. Government spending simply balloons the "x". 
From a purely economic perspective, It doesn't really matter where the spending goes. It can be military spending, tax cuts, or green new deal and medicare for all. It doesn't matter, all dollars are created equal and in the same fashion. Where the money goes is politics. The amount of money is economics.


How is it bogus? Specially, what I said. I specifically clarified that money velocity wasn't as relevant as it used to be due to credit cards and e-payments. But in the end, productivity is a hard limit to economic speed. You can only produce so many goods in a fixed amount of time, given a specific infrastructure, and so spending more than your productive capacity leads to inflation. I don't get what's bogus about that. It makes perfect sense.
It's maintained by many economic schools of all sides of the ideological spectrum *for a reason*!

HODL is about long term growth, too! It didn’t go from $0.30 to $12,000 in a day. It took years! It will take years to go from $6k to $60k, but it’ll happen. You don’t need to check the price daily. It’s not healthy either...
@_date: 2019-03-28 16:01:03
I am not an expert, but from what I understand, economic growth is a function of three variables:
1. The rate at which money is created
2. The rate at which money is spent (at which things are created)
3. The speed with which money goes from being created to being spent. 
No. 1 is influenced by the government through interest rates. The higher the interest rate, the slower the money will be created.
No. 2 can be influenced by the government by being the biggest spender. So, the size of the deficit (or surplus) is a big factor (and in most countries, the defining factor) to calculate this variable. The deficit (or surplus) is the difference between taxes collected and government spending. So, taxes are a big factor in this.
No. 3 Is harder to calculate and influence, specially now that we have credit cards and instant e-payments. However, some economists have noticed that people slow down spending when they have to pay obligations (i.e., debt, debt service, rent, taxes, etc.). The government can't directly influence most of those factors, but it *can* influence the tax rate.
So, the government affects economic growth through these three mechanisms: money creation (mostly interest rates, but the Fed has other tools too), the deficit, and the tax rate.
Here's the thing, there are limits to economic growth determined by productivity (the absorption rate of the economy). If you try to grow faster than the economy can absorb, you end up with hyperinflation (see: Venezuela).  
Why do we pay taxes? Taxes are a speed limit to economic growth. They're there mostly to regulate that the money supply doesn't grow faster than the economy can absorb, and prevent hyperinflation.

Back in 2017 I recovered an old wallet just wondering how much I still had left. I had bought $25 in btc (can’t remember the exchange rate) in 2013, with the purpose of buying a $20 Amazon card, so I could say I’d bought something from Amazon with bitcoin. It ended up costing me like $22 with fees...

Yes, there are well defined cycles of economic activities for all types of commodities and assets, including bitcoin.


The reason may not be apparent, but there are actually many. It's just hard to understand how much weight each reason gets:
1. Bitcoin is up nearly 200% since March, even if the past few weeks it has been in a sort of lull, a lot of people are still bullish on BTC. It was expected that the bullish trend continued, it was just a matter of time.
2. For that reason, a lot of people who want bitcoin will put as much money as they can afford into it. But most people live paycheck to paycheck, so they have to wait until the next paycheck to put money into bitcoin. Paychecks come at pre-defined times, for example, end of the month or beginning of the month. Today is the beginning of the month of August. It is not abnormal to think that a big influx of cash would occur.
3. Yesterday, bitcoin passed a mining milestone, giving the market better information on supply and its scarcity/availability.
4. Yesterday, the Federal reserve made the dollar cheaper by lowering interest rates. This usually makes other currencies, like bitcoin, stronger.
So, take your pick. Any of those causes, or a combination of some or all of them caused the uptick.


Yes, Bitcoin is a currency with high volatility. As it matures, volatility will decrease and price will stabilize. But that is maybe 5 or 10 years away at least...

Let’s put it another way. 
In most US States and at the federal level, marihuana is banned. Has that stopped the commerce of marihuana anywhere?
Same with bitcoin. The difference between a fiat currency and a hard currency like bitcoin or gold, is that the government has to physically seize the asset to restrict its trade. And you can’t physically seize bitcoin, you can only seize a private key that has bitcoin associated to it.

People usually post these kind of memes more often when the price drops, even slightly.
In contrast, when the price hikes (even slightly), they'll post instead about how corrupt the banking system is, or how it's all going to the moon...
So I saw this, and was so worried. Took a look at the price, and I'm still breathing. Then I got to thinking, maybe I worry too much...
It's pointless to look at day to day, or hour to hour changes. Asset prices are better understood as medium-term trends. What has bitcoin been doing for the past month? It's been rising! Somedays it will go down, sure, but until it's 10 or so days of falls, I'm not worried.
Bitcoin will rise and fall in price compared to fiat, until fiat seizes to exist. Bitcoin still has challenges to overcome before it replaces fiat. Bitcoin will replace fiat someday. All of that is true. So don't worry about day to day changes in price. 
When bitcoin had it's last crash last year, the price dropped from $19,000 in late 2017 to nearly $3,000 in early 2019. Guess what? 10 years ago, one bitcoin costed just a few cents. The long term view is bullish for bitcoin. It has value and it has conserved and accumulated for 10 years! Bitcoin is no fluke. It will not rise uninterruptedly, but it will rise. Have faith, have foresight, invest in bitcoin today!

No, people can also win if Bitcoin replaces fiat. And it doesn’t need to replace fiat entirely. It merely suffices to replace current financial services that are fiat-based. For example, international money transfers.
Today, I sent $100 USD to a friend in Japan. It took 15 minutes and costed near to nothing, compared to the traditional way which takes a week and costs nearly 20% in fees. Bitcoin has a niche, and from there it can derive value.

Microsoft Word and Apple Pages offer options to export your files as PDF and other formats. 
The most popular ebook formats are PDF, Mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle), and ePub (compatible with Apple iBooks and other ebook readers). A software called Calibre can also convert formats. Check it out.
You can then setup a website where you can sell your book and offer a download of any of these files.
You can also sell through the Amazon kindle store and iTunes.
Personally, I’d prefer to buy it from you directly paying in bitcoin and getting a mobi and ePub versions. Mostly because I use a Kindle, but the people I’d share it with use iPads.

"Fiat currency" and "credit" are two different inventions. Though related (fiat currency is based on credit), they are not the same. Credit can still exist, but denominated in crypto rather than on fiat.  
Think about buying a house. In 10 years, instead of you paying $300,000 USD for one, you could be paying 30m₿ (or 0.03₿). It would still be worth the same, but instead of paying it in dollars, you'd be paying it in bitcoin. So, since it's still the same, you probably still need to borrow money in the form of a mortgage loan to pay for it. So the bank would lend you the 0.03₿, and you'd have 30 years of monthly payments of 0.017361m₿ (0.000017361₿ )...
Under the same logic, you could also have credit cards. You purchase stuff with bitcoin, a bank would put it on your credit card tab, and you'd pay your credit card balance at the end of the month.
But, you'd argue, the volatility! Your monthly payment could be worth a lot more in dollars in 30 years time! Well, first of all, since bitcoin adoption would be widespread (instead of niche as it is today), the volatility wouldn't be as drastic as it's today. Second, you'd be paid in bitcoin too! Bitcoin would have replaced fiat by then anyway! So nothing would change in practice for most people anyway. Only the denomination of their currency, and they way they manage it, and HODL it.

It means the government imposes controls on what people or companies can do with “foreign capital” (i.e., currencies not minted by the national government over which such rules apply).
It can mean anything from a restriction on the amount of foreign currency you can buy, to a restriction to how much you can hold in a bank, hold in general, or transport or transfer out of the country.
The goal of these controls is, allegedly, to prevent a sell-off of national currency (the national equivalent of a bank run, in this case, a central bank run). Since everyone knows that this means people are taking their money out of the country at a pace the central bank can’t keep up with, capital controls almost always have the opposite effect to the intended, accelerating capital flight through illegal means.
With bitcoin, though, you don’t have to worry because the bitcoins are not physically in the country imposing the capital controls. They’re in the blockchain! And if capital controls were to be announced in your country, bitcoin is a great way to transfer value across borders without the government being able to stop you (I.e., enforcing capital controls on it). 
Argentina is one of the top 20 economies in the world. For them to be doing this, it means that bitcoin is about to get a lot of customers with a big need to exchange fiat for capital...

I don’t want to extend this into an argument over gun rights and gun control, since it’s well beyond the scope of this sub-reddit, which is a Bitcoin subreddit.
So instead I want to focus on the financial subject at hand, and that is this concept of money ownership.
I certainly understand why you’d have the expectation that the money in your debit account would be yours. Except, it’s not! It’s the banks!
When you deposit money into a debit account, you are loaning money to the bank. The money is now owned by the bank but also owed to you. The bank then loans out the money at a higher interest than it pays you, and so makes a profit.
If you need to withdraw the money, or use your debit card to pay for goods or services, the bank then pays you back by borrowing from the reserves from other customer’s deposits, or borrowing from other banks, or the central bank. But the key is that the bank has a recourse to avoid paying you back immediately. This is important to avoid bank runs being devastating to the bank (also why the FDIC exists). So, the bank is not necessarily obligated to let you pay for anything you want using your debit card with any positive balance. They can refuse! Because it’s not your money, it’s simply a claim to a debt you agreed to enter with the bank!
To get even more philosophical, even if you were paying cash, it’s not really your money either! Bank notes have value because the US government says so, and they have as much value as the US government has decreed. If the US government wants to invalidate your particular bank notes, they can. They can also devalue or debase your dollars and make them worth less value than when you obtained them. (In fact, they do this all the time through inflation!). So even cash is not your money!
The only way to be sure that you own your own money is by using non-fiat monetary options, such as gold or bitcoin. If you were to purchase a gun, or anything else, with bitcoin, the government wouldn’t have any power to interfere in your transaction. It would be between you as the buyer, and the seller. But as long as fiat (US dollars) or debt-based alternatives (debit or credit cards) are being used, there are many intermediaries including the bank and the government which can use their power to interfere in your transaction.
I think this should be the key takeaway from this proposal.
@_date: 2019-09-12 23:25:02
There are many issues here. Some I'm fine with, others, not so much...
1. I don't see how this violates the 2nd amendment. First of all, the 2nd amendment isn't an unrestricted right to buy all sorts of weapons. But mostly, the 2nd amendment doesn't protect your right to use a credit card to buy anything, including guns. It simply protects your right to buy guns when you are part of a well regulated militia (a very vague term that merits its own discussion, but which isn't in the scope of this comment). You can still buy guns legally using other payment methods, including bitcoin, so his proposal isn't anti-constitutional. It is a valid proposal, which some people might agree with and other won't...
2. I am for gun control. I am not for banning access to guns. I just want a bit more regulation. I want it so that buying guns is at least as hard (or easy) as it is to buy a car. You can buy a car with a credit card (though it's a terrible idea), so you should be able to buy a gun with a credit card. I think O'Rourke's reason for doing this is that such a restriction can be done directly by the President, but doing it right (i.e., putting in restrictions that should be there but still allowing the use of credit cards) would require so much political capital that it's virtually impossible.
3. One of the things that makes it hard to do gun reform correctly is the fact that States can just pass whatever regulations they want that side-step the Federal regulations. In the same way that States have been able to decriminalize weed or California has been able to enact tougher emission standards for cars, States can just make it easier to buy guns than the Federal government would want. This is due to the 10th amendment. So, really, O'Rourke's proposal is more of a violation to the 10th amendment than to the 2nd amendment. Not to mention the Interstate Commerce clause... I mean, I am not a Constitutional expert, but to me, those two arguments carry more weight than saying that this proposal is against the 2nd amendment.
4. Bitcoin is the opposite of a credit cards, so suggesting someone to pay in bitcoin instead of a credit card defeats the purpose of the entire thing as it confuses users. With bitcoin, you are paying for stuff as if you were using cash. With credit cards, you are instantly entering into debt with your bank and promising to pay for your stuff at a later date. It's an entire different logic.
5. You are also more easily trackable with credit cards (which, by the way, means that this proposal is not only dangerous from a civil liberties standpoint, but also stupid. You want to restrict gun sales to potentially dangerous individuals, so if someone sells them a gun with which they later commit a crime, you want to be able to track it and credit card records can help! No such luck with cash or bitcoin, or at least, not as easily...) This proposal actually would help anonymize methodic killers who plan their attacks months in advance. If they have the foresight to plan for months, they also have the foresight to save money to buy a gun cash. Not having a credit card isn't going to stop them. 
In summary, I do think we need gun control reform in this country. I think O'Rourke's proposal is a "low hanging fruit", or "shortcut" that, though easy for a President to enact, is poorly thought out and would have serious repercussions. I think it's irresponsible to suggest that this proposed restriction be sidestepped with bitcoin, but mostly because this isn't what bitcoin was designed to do, as bitcoin is not a substitute for a credit card but an upgrade on cash. Finally, I think that this proposal does more harm than good, and despite it not being against the 2nd amendment, it could potentially be against the 10th and the commerce clause.
@_date: 2019-09-18 23:29:53
To be fair, the problems trying to be solved today are not caused *directly* by "printing" too much money.
The problem, narrowly defined, is that the US economy is slowing down due to trade restrictions (i.e., the direct result of Trump's mismanagement of the economy). 
It was already a house of cards, but the trade war is like violently shaking the table upon where it was built. The Fed's response? Let's build stronger beams for the house, made out of the same cards!

Bonds are the epitome of security for many investors. Investors will stop buying them when they cease to be secure.

Trezor actually has made penetration testing on their devices.
The last time I read about them was a few months ago, they discovered that there was a vulnerability on their device. BUT only if the Trezor was connected directly to the computer of the malicious person (unlikely, as the Trezor is offline most of the time), and they promised a patch in weeks. 
I trust Trezor for my needs.
It is also important to note that neither the Trezor nor the Ledger are actual cold storage. They're more like lukewarm storage. Cold storage means it's not ever connected to the internet, or to a device connected to the internet. You need to connect both the Trezor and the Ledger to an internet-connected device, like a computer or mobile phone, for authorization of transactions, getting new addresses, or general maintenance. A cold storage is only a paper wallet (or steel-engraved wallet, or something similar). A Trezor and a Ledger are cold when not plugged, but are hot when plugged. A paper wallet is never plugged.
In the case of the Ledger X, it actually has several access points, including bluetooth so it works with iPhone, which also would make it less secure in theory. The simplest the device, the colder it is, and thus the more secure it is. It really is a trade-off between functionality/convenience and security. Having said that, you also have to consider the probability of you being personally targeted or attacked by a hack. I'd say that for most people, a Ledger, even in a Ledger X, or any Trezor, would be fine. If you are a super paranoid, and high-profile person storing millions in coins, then a paper wallet would probably be best for you. In other words, you do get more security the colder the device is (and nothing is colder than paper wallets), but the gain in security is marginal so you have to weight it agains the convenience and probability of actually being attacked.

Then they shouldn’t have elected politicians that indebted their nation.

Based on what? Your desire to find someone to blame for the mistakes of politicians you agree with?

That’s the point of the IMF. It’s to (a) help a troubled country meet their immediate obligations to *prevent systemic financial collapse*, and (b) tell the countries how to fix their problem for the long term.
B is a recipe countries don’t want to follow because it’s painful, which is why IMF makes B a condition of A.
If you don’t want your country to have to do B, then don’t allow your country to get so stupidly indebted so as to require A.

As far as I understand this, from a non-Argentinean (but someone well versed with Latin American economies), the inflation caused by a closed economy and failing exchange rate was what doomed the previous President of Argentina (as is often the story in Latin America). 
What is different now that the current President seems to have a political protection from this? Why is he still politically alive when he hasn't been able to solve the exchange rate and inflation crises?

Notice how none of the causes of this is the IMF:
But let’s forget about Argentina. When Pakistan needed an IMF bailout, was the cause the evil IMF, or their own internal irresponsibility?
When Ecuador needed a bailout, who bailed them out? Yeah, that’s right. The “evil” IMF:
Notice the pattern here: 1. Politicians wreck their countries. 2. IMF comes in and tries to fix the mess. 3. The fix hurts. 4. The politicians blame it on the IMF.

The original loan was fair. It was sold to the recovery hedge fund only AFTER the dead beat country defaulted. 
It’s not a “money making scam”, it’s a financial service for the holders of the country’s debt. 
The only one attempting the scam is the politician who asked for a loan that the country couldn’t repay.

Ok. If you say so. The Marxist opinion columnists you linked certainly know how to pass opinion as fact.
Anyway, I’ve been seeing IMF slander for days now, what’s driving all of this interest against the only institution designed to bail out the financial systems of countries decimated by failed (leftist) governments?

World GDP is $18.6 Trillion. Let’s assume that the world’s savings are at least 10x GDP; global bond market size is around $100 trillion!
There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin.
So, according to these assumptions, a price point of $100k/btc doesn’t necessarily imply a fiat catastrophe.  It could very well reach a million no problem.
A price of $476k/btc would merely mean that bitcoin has captured 10% of the bond market’s size... It would still be a small market, and have a huge valuation!

The IMF comes in after the crisis. It doesn’t cause the crisis.

None of what you said cancels the fact that the investments were unproductive, or that the people were fine without overthrowing the government while they were asking for loans.
@_date: 2019-05-21 03:51:50
The IMF didn't force Argentina to borrow like crazy to finance unproductive investments, though. Don't blame the IMF for setting their conditions to emergency loans. If countries behaved reasonably, they wouldn't need emergency loans.

I don’t think there is.
I think it is more likely that you’d find a correlation between daily meme volume and daily bitcoin dollar-value change. But I don’t know if the correlation would be positive or negative. And, of course, correlation doesn’t imply causation.

Of course they have an option: don’t take on more debt than you can service, and don’t take on debt for things that don’t spur economic growth!

That is a guarantee of payment. Which is perfectly normal when lending money to a known deadbeat.

What I meant was that the amount of money banks can create is limited by two fed instruments: reserve limits and interest rates. So, ultimately, it’s fed policy which creates the money. 
Anyway, this is a two-month old comment. Why even respond to it? It’s no longer topical!

Of course there is. Just every single case where the IMF has participated, IMF manuals, IMF documentation, and even the IMF articles of agreement, by-laws and regulations!

“Enslaving with debt”. It’s not the IMF who loaned Argentina money in the first place... in fact, by the time IMF shows up, the country has fucked up so badly, no one else will loan them any money!
