Cheers QS, think there may be a gap in the market.

Airbitz seems to work for my location in London.

Brilliant poster - expect to see this around a lot :)

These groups are basically replicating whole social structures, rather than just killing people.

99 artists is easy for FTB. Our HQ is in the London Artists' Warehouse scene.

LOLs, the DHR story is patently bullshit as it cites me as being in the middle of it all. I'm linked to FTB, which is a big project, and to the bitmobile (in development), that's about my involvement.

Don't know bout the account but the M.O. of these groups is pretty broad.
Here's an insightful TED Talk

Here's some more context.
"Bitcoin in Kenya", a great doc by Tomer Kantor.

Been in a similar situation, shame :(

LOLs. I've spotted btc art here in london and posted it, later found out it was done by someone in ftb. Roger Ver has.

Some nice stuff here.

I am not a fucking detective. 
@_date: 2015-09-19 21:16:07
WTF!! I was not involved with Abby. I am a project/events manager for the group and head a team for "bitmobile"
@_date: 2015-09-19 22:13:45
I have no real connection to Abby. The"Evil Svengali" probably should. I am just a project/events manager for that group.

Interesting tie in.

Looks like a cool show.
