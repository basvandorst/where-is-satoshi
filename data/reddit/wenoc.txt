Casual. I’m bitcoin super-operator.

Because of the rules of this subreddit. Linking the www-version is just deleted.

Yeah, I'm very sceptic too. 
Hyvää uutta vuotta.

The stock market relies on these. They are not just opinions when they control the stock market. 
If a house suddenly crumbles for no reason, the team who developed the new concrete can't just fall back on saying their research is just their opinion. 


You don't know? This is a well established fact. Again not a matter of opinion. Wether they did it on purpose or not can be debated, but there are no doubts as to wether it was false.

That’s not what he asked.

As long as there is a concept of value there will be people who speculate and invest in growth. Aka, bankers. It doesn't matter if you buy and sell wheat with cash, gold or bitcoin.

[Linux Mint](
Fedora used to be nice, but in later years it has been pretty terrible and the Red Hat yum/rpm package handler is massively inferior to aptitude. It's of course a question of taste, but I do recommend sticking to debian-based distributions.

Thanks for that tip. I will test that at some point. Never tried it.

I think it's obvious who the idiot is here.

No, you really can't. Macs are great machines but they are not suited for a lot of things. For gaming you want a PC, for running servers you want a linux. For routing/firewalling you are **fucked** with a mac, you really need linux. For media services you want either linux or windows as macs are crippled with network mounts and non-native filesystems.
If you want a really good laptop though, I'd pick a macbook any day. Not that it is better in *everything*, but it's very good all-round. Every other Apple product is much worse than its competitors at *something*. The problem with Apple is that you're not allowed to configure anything yourself. If it doesn't work like you want it to, tough luck. 
If a linux/android/windows/etc doesn't work the way I want it to I just change the way it works.

Linux Mint is a nice Debian based distribution. Much better than Ubloantu. It gives a nice look and feel that should make mac users comfortable.

You're so bad at it I didn't even realize.

You have no idea about my motives so your argument is null.


I never said I did. Lol?


You, apparently.

Actually I've had a HTC Desire android which was crap and now I have an iPhone 5.
But you go around thinking that anything that cannot be used to buy groceries **right now** is by default useless. That's a very special kind of stupid. It's also a whole bunch of other fallacies. It's a non sequitur, reductio ad absurdum as well as an ad hominem attack in there.
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:31:12
We have a RFC for that. But you knew that already.

Totally lost it here. Thank you sir. You are a scholar and gentleman.

Still in a completely different ballpark than iOS, OSX, Windows, Android etc. Also a lot more updated than RHEL and CentOS IIRC, which are considered secure.  I update most of the core packages from Debian.

Great argument. I bet you're top of your class.
