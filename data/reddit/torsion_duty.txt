I don't think that you can send encrypted information over Murs though at most only encoded. 
Not can't but not legal in the US.

TIL, i thought some encrypted info had to be sent out in the sig

I absolutely refuse to do any business with WF. They fucked me years ago with overdraft fees that I didn't owe because their shit auto pay triple paid my auto insurance one month. This was before text was main stream and way before smart phones. Here I was walking around paying a $33 surcharge for a fucking Coke and so on until I started getting the letters in the mail. I was young and didn't know I could fight a bank. They could have had me as a customer for life but instead stole from me and I'm sure lots of others. 
Fuck Wells Fargo.

Cashing out to pay taxes and claim capital losses against hopeful gains later this year.

Head over to and read the side bar.

It's certainly not good right now but it's still profitable. Just look at what you are learning in terms of coins not US dollars. As long as you have a little bit of money set aside to pay the electric bill at the end of the month you'll be fine. Just hold your coins until you are where you want to be $/day

No kidding, and one of the to comments is going all *let's not be too hasty here brrr drrrr *. Some take getting fucked (when you aren't asking for it) a little too lightly.
Fuck Bank of America!

Perfect timing for someone.
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:35:52
Booooooo ��

How is that even possible? Either you are talking shit pay, pay crazy electric per kwh, or math might not be your thing.
edit: show me how I'm wrong and I'll turn my shit of for 24 hours.

You did a good job. I enjoyed out.
I would sub "they are paid with the honor" with "they are paid with Tron"
-Tron holder
Poor Tron...
Fucking Tron

That shitwit had no idea how to predict a market at all. I hope I don't get fired or end up in court for telling you this...

Where do I get DipCoin? Do you know who is on the team?
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:01:21
I heard it also. A fool and his money.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:21:31

Yep, getting mine in a few days.

Hell yeah it is! Everything has it's purpose.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:35:58
Keep smokin.
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:45:58
Yes it does! It is not nearly as reactitve to oxygen as a silver alloy, but it is. Gold is also extremely malleable meaning much less needs to be used to plate cheaper materials, in turn costing less. 
edit: Any more dipshit?

HOLY SHIT!!! WE HAVE FOUND THE SOLUTION TO HIGH PRICE GOLD IN ELECTRONIC MANUFACTURING!!! You really have no idea what you are talking about. Silver sulfide is conductive, but has a loss of conductivity. Gold is used where those losses can be tolerated.
Edit: no losses to those losses
