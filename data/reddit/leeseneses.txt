Well whether I'm going to pay $10 or $100 for a pizza it won't fill me up more or less. A BTC's buying power is unfixed.
@_date: 2015-06-14 23:52:59
Well, you can divide dollars into cents. If you literally divide a dollar then what's the point.
Let's say, though, that the dollar wasn't subject to open ended inflation and, digitally, you could divide it down to millionths. Dollars don't have a set value, they're backed by nothing.
@_date: 2015-06-15 02:33:02
I don't really see how freezing the analogy in time doesn't invalidate it. The problem isn't rhat BTC don't magically gain value when divided (or something. Obviously they won't) in an instant, one BTC buys what it buys and so do its requisite 1/1,000,000ths buy 1/1,000,000th of that value.
In that sense BTC has a finite value, but that value can change over time. The count of BTC also has no open-ended inflation. So by the economic meaning it is scarce. That doesn't mean that the economic system that uses it must also be scarce.
Anyway; what was your point with the original analogy? Was it sarcastic? If it is then are you trying to make the point that, because pizza being divisible is pointless then bitcoin divisibility is also pointless?
@_date: 2015-06-14 23:39:18
Wait, Schiff said that?
I've got to see this. I'm a bit sad now.
@_date: 2015-06-14 23:47:50
Pizza has an intrinsic, fixed value (assuming our stomachs don't grow or shrink) where BTC doesn't, so that is a really shitty analogy.

bitcoin's cryptographic core is provided via computations called 'mining.' Basically, by mining blocks (data passed around the bitcoin network) miners (computing devices on the network) are processing transactions. By mining, you are rewarded with bitcoin, some of which is spontaneously generated, more and more of which is provided via transaction fees from users as time goes on (since only so many bitcoins can be created.)

The entire point of bitcoinis that a synicate of people can act collectively to run a stale system while remaining only loosely affiliated. if bitcoin actually comes under the control of a single concern or cooperating, large concerns then they ha e the power to subvert the network through double transactions and ignoring transactions they don't want.

saying QE is a cntributor to stock prices is different from saying it's the sole contributor, though.

that's why it would have a bidding system. node providers could render their own fees or routed data.

Why is it such a great thing to emulate Satoshi anyway. HE isn't great, what he did was. We know little about him and that might help us avoid idol worship. The whole reason I like bitcoin as a community is it is more syndicalist/flat. There isn't a cult of personality to fall in behind.
@_date: 2015-08-18 01:34:42
It's still lobbying and it betrays bitcoin as not capable of full policy neutrality. Like the fed, the banks or other existing interests, it would plant bitcoin more firmly in the realm of a political instrument, capable of being used to leverage power.
But that's only my opinion of the broad strokes of this. Though, ideally, like other parts of bitcoin, blocksize expansion, I feel, would be best automated as that could insulate it from needing to be controlled directly.
@_date: 2015-08-05 23:32:17
And some people would take the current systemic issues of bitcoin over having to deal with Paypal's aggressive AML. Go figure.

Not sure why this is so downvoted. It seems like a pragmatic view to me. Members of the multitude of fans and tinkerers (us) talk about single rights and wrongs but the collective vector of bitcoin matters. Bitcoin is an instrument and it WILL face exploitation by anyone. People have opinions and they have will, the devs aren't above that. It's not a surprise nor am I particularly disappointed by that perspective.
If we want to build an instrument that really exists to do collective good for humanity in some way, then we've got to be fault tolerant. We've got to expect co-option of it.

Well, if I recall correctly it was something the CIA or FBI had planned. Up to the postwar period, it was a pretty acceptable way to think. Coveting freedom and guarding against the slow rot of people acting together in private was pretty normal.
But then at some point, one of the three letter agencies had begun drafting a plan to discredit conspiracy as a valid argument by flooding communication channels with crackpot theories and trying to associate conspiracy speculation with paranoia.
Someone's probably got the actual name of this plan as it was either leaked or declassified a long while ago. If not I can go looking.

Except this sort of scenario can only happen if you store your coons in a centrally managed exchange. If your wallet is compromised, it was probably because you didnt keep your public key very secret.

Not really that tinfoil hat. I don't understand why conspiracy in and of itself is seen as so poisonous in general. If nothing else, it writes a roadmap of how we could use nothing but negligence and bad decision making to screw ourselves. 
Now, taking the conspiracy ball and running with it all the way to the other end of the field is a different story.
@_date: 2015-08-18 01:51:31

@_date: 2015-04-04 17:01:02
That sentiment may be good or bad, but the foundation seems like a bad fit for this community. If we can innovate in the decentralized nature of bitcoin itself, why can't we invent mew decentralized ways to develop it?
@_date: 2015-04-04 16:57:13
I'm not sure why we don't use the same de-facto decentralization for development. Isn't it possible for miners to adopt forks on their own? Hell, you could even pay out from a trust fund based on the percentage of adoption.

Except it's also spreading the cost around. People don't choose when or where they're rendered injured or ill, life does. Luckily, injury isn't terribly common so if everyone pays for everyone's healthcare you ensure, if it happens to you, you're set no matter the circumstances at play.
