We have the exact same system in Sweden, but you can choose if you want to pay a variable price per kWh or a set price. The variable price is almost always the best deal.

It's definitely not the first time. Back in the beginning of pooled mining,  deepbit was the big scary. They used to be getting DDOSed every so often, supposedly because they approached 51%.

From what I can understand, the machine works with pre-made QR codes for set amounts of BTC. An obvious upgrade would be if it had its own QR generation ability and wallet function, so you could purchase any amount of BTC. Unfortunately,this would also make the machine an even more interesting target for criminals.

I guess you could configure that bill scanner to accept any type of bills.

During the winter, the heat is also of some use. Not that many people use electric heat though, as it's pretty expensive. Here in Sweden, one kWh of electricity is ~ 1 SEK, while 1 kWh of district heating is only 0.50 SEK.

It's very common in Sweden. They even had a nuclear powered district heating grid in Stockholm in the 60's and 70's.

It IS true in the sense that it's dead simple to create a new altcoin blockchain, and loads of new altcoins to go with that chain. However, that is not a weakness and it does not make existing bitcoins less worth.

At first I was going to say "That will make you the scammer", but that's not true. The alleged scammer offered to up with 60% to begin with.

I see. Thanks!

30 (Euros per megawatt) = 0.264200094 Swedish kronor per kilowatt
That price is before taxes and fees though. What's the cost for a normal person?

I'm missing an explanation of how Bitcoin works, but I guess this infographic is more about history than technical details.

It looks like it's been hugged to death right now.

~16k USD "lost", based on $806 for one BTC on Bitstamp right now. Ouch!

A correction would likely have them saying "Yeah, I was thinking of investing in Bitcoin, but then it crashed".

What's up with the subtle background image of a charicature jew and a large Bitcoin?

Student loans?

Yep, that's it.

What we are seing now, bitcoin acceptance from semi-large American stores and services such as OKcupid, lots of Subway restaurants, Wordpress, Adafruit and the like, is the beginning of a true takeoff.

"Free" money, with the risk that the interest rate on the student loan goes up.

I also tried, my phone couldn't scan it off the screen.

That looks like an Arduino pro mini. Would you mind sharing the code for the QR generation?
Also, what OLED display is that? How much was it?

The first institutional exchange was Mt.Gox, which was started in 2010. Price data from 2009 is anecdotal, and quite unreliable.

A bitcoin black swan? Pretty original thinking.

Shouldn't pretty much every B2B transaction have a B2C counterpart? Sure, there's a chain of B2B transactions before it ends in B2C, and therefore the volume of B2B transactions are larger. Does a transaction involving the government count as B2B?

"Gomorron Sverige" is produced by SVT (Swedish state-run, "independent" television) themselves, so they hold the copyright themselves. If they wanted to, they could make it free for everyone to watch.

How could it ever BE a ponzi scheme? I don't get why people would think that.
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:24:16
I had a similar idea. I put the redeeming QR code on the back, and frame the "certificate" though. That way, it would have to be taken down from the wall and taken out of the frame to redeem/steal.

What are your interest rates like, and where are you from?
In Sweden, the interest on student loans (state run, the only kind we have here) are currently 1.3%.
The interest rates on house loans vary, but many people are paying 2.5-3.5%. There is a tax deduction of 30% for loan interest though - but it's not applicable to student loans.

50 SEK (~8 USD) is not at all uncommon for a latte in Stockholm, Sweden. In Oslo, Norway, 50 NOK (also ~8 USD) would be considered cheap.
