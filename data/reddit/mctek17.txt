Nobody will stomp on Bitcoin and force it to shut down.  I get that it's decentralized.  But it will lose value because it will never be widely accepted at most retailers.  It can work as foreign exchange but again, not many exchanges happening in Bitcoin.  Where is the real value?  Does anyone think it should have a market cap equal to Visa right now?

good point about them probably not using a blockchain if they continue using a centralized system... However they choose to do it, I'm sure they'll be looking closer at ways to improve security, verification of transactions, and transaction speeds, especially for FX market.

both you and tmornini should read my reply to you below. I think you have the wrong impression. but everyone's entitled to their own opinions.

I get the advantages of us having control for once, but a country would sooner adopt it's own crypto before letting all the control slip through their fingers. and unfortunately most people will capitulate

if you have free Bitcoin money, I'd sell it soon

I apologize... it is kinda long.  just trying to help.    and I know I'm new to Reddit, but I just wanted to share my thought.  no offense meant to anyone

I have, and I am actually a proponent of Bitcoin.   Therefore, I agree with most of what you said... just not the part about what people will flock to.  people tend to use what is easiest, and by easiest I mean widely accepted.  some people making comments are making assumptions about me and the experience I have in this.  they assume that because I'm new to Reddit, I must be new to Bitcoin. Actually, it's quite the opposite.  I hope that this technology continues to flourish, but hoping for something is not always the same as what we think will happen. to be clear, it would be a shame if what I said in my post happens. but that doesn't change my opinion. thank you for your thoughts

It wasn't meant to be a rant. It's just an opinion that might be helpful to some, and it's ok you disagree.  I appreciate your response.  If you found yourself getting upset at what I said, maybe you can see why I say people get emotional about their investments.
