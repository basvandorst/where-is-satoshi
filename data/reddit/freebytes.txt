Every sci-fi you have seen has 'credits' that are universal and traded between governments and people, and there seems to be no central control over it.  This is the sci-fi dream made reality so there is a potential that it could become the standard currency.  While currencies may exist, it could end up being the intermediary just like the dollar is now (for oil).  It also works well considering the concepts of blockchain electricity and other markets that work well with blockchain concepts.

Every attempt at such goals has actually lost me money.  I planned to sell at $1000 because of the Mt. Gox $1200 spookiness.  I then bought in again at $2700.  Then, I said I would sell at $9000 which I did.  Then, it went up to $19000.  Basically, whenever I sell, it doubles!  These are also the 'walls' we have been seeing because people are thinking the same way I have.  For now, I am holding.  If I lose it all, it is really no big deal because while it would hurt to lose money, it is not money that I need to survive.
Edit: And to be clear, I actually bought in originally simply because I liked the idea of using Bitcoin as a currency.  I stopped caring about the currency aspect as heavily when Cointip died.  (By the way, check your Cointip accounts if you have not to make sure you do not have any money just sitting around.  They will still let you transfer it away.)

I did not buy a full coin, but yeah, I have done well.  And I really do not beat myself up.  I was simply demonstrating that even having a plan is similar to trying to time the market in this particular environment.
Also, for exchanges, as much as Coinbase and GDAX get bashed by people, they really are good starting points for new people.  If you do not know what you are doing, you can get hacked and lose your coins if you keep them unprotected on your own computer.  Exchanges give a fair method of exchange between two parties.  I really dislike the algorithms Coinbase uses to perform their exchanges, though, and the more power they are given, the more they can hold back technological advances with Bitcoin.

Sorry.  I misunderstood.  I thought you were demeaning the quality of Wikipedia, and I had to run to their defense!
The reason Wikipedia is not a good source for academic papers is because it is like looking in an encyclopedia for answers instead of researching on your own, and it makes sense that teachers would not allow it for that reason; however, that does not mean that either encyclopedias or Wikipedia is not suitable for research into topics altogether.

While I started to mine a bit in the past, I never really made anything from it.  But, I actually bought my first BTC on Coinbase simply to use it for cointip.  I did not even buy a whole coin.

You will hear "do not store your Bitcoins on an exchange like Coinbase", but I think it is probably more secure for someone that is inexperienced to do this than to store them on your own computer.  Ledger Nano is good, but there is still risk no matter what your choice.  The hardware wallet is probably your most secure option, then having them on Coinbase, then storing them on your own computer.

Watsi is an excellent choice.

What does not make sense to me about this entire scenario as described on that PasteBin post is that the private key is what is used to create the Bitcoin wallet address.  How can the address be seed for the private key if the address uses the private key to be created?

That is the way the military industrial complex works as well, though.  This would be to save lives instead of taking them, but it is still not UBI unless you are giving it to all adult citizens unconditionally.

That is not actually a bad plan.  If you took away currency from everyone and simply redistributed it slowly, it would increase in value and the prices would decrease as well, but it would be easier to introduce a new currency instead and peg this to the new one at its high inflation rate.  Step 1 would be to first eliminate the corruption that caused this mess in the first place, though, or you would have this problem all over again.

The issue with anonymity is that the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously, and we cannot confirm he is alive necessarily.  That would probably be a prerequisite.  Perhaps ask him to transfer one of his coins to prove he is still alive.

Do you have any suggestions for this?  The thing about the dollar is that it can be easily wiped out and replaced.  The wealthy will not be as impacted if they are diversified in other commodities.

Market cap being the sum of all Bitcoin holdings I think he means.  All Bitcoins are now worth more than they ever have been.  There is more money in Bitcoins than there ever has been.

I find it interesting that you said rural land.  I am thinking you qualified the word land because of imminent domain, but the government may still take your land even if it is rural.  Nonetheless, it is less likely.  I know firsthand about the flaws of thinking the land is yours.  (A family member of mine had his land taken.  He went to court to fight it and lost everything.  The cost of fighting the government ruined him and he ended up losing the land anyway for much less than what it was worth to him.)
@_date: 2019-02-24 04:21:43
Why do you think this?
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:41:03
Yes, I know, but it is possible for a future fork to add more if I understand correctly, and 21 million gives the impression that it will be the full money supply so I was just clarifying.

Did you make sure that all of them matched your account?  You want to be sure no one was actually trying to break into your account.  Could have been locked if someone was trying to brute force it.

Not necessarily.
Even if there are no changes to Bitcoin itself, fractional reserve banking could result in more than 21 million being in the money supply system.

The danger of this is that the machine is missing security updates.  A worm could come along and attack you as soon as you put the machine online.  This would make the machine potentially less secure than even a Windows machine with the latest updates using an air gap USB solution.

That depends on whether you are referencing M0, M1, etc. as the "money supply".  People will hold Bitcoin in accounts that will then be lent which could eventually cause a run on the banks like can happen now.  I am not sure what plans there are to prevent against such things.  Unlike fiat, though, the central banks cannot simply be given money that does not exist.  It is a real concern that will need to be addressed.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:52:56
The risk is becoming greater every day.  Printers, coffee makers, and refrigerators are going online nowadays.  If one of those gets hacked (which you know those companies care less about security probably) then you are going to have something on your own local network trying to break into computers, and they are either looking to steal your coins or send spam email from your toaster.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:47:03
When you are referencing "inherent property" that the dollar has, you are correct.  I did not fully answer the question in that case.  I was referencing an external property the dollar has.  There is no inherent difference except that the dollar has little paper slips that signify value.  Most of its value exists ethereally, though, and interestingly most is stored on computers or in ledgers just like Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:55:42
Yes, but if you have rich customers, you want to keep them happy.  If they are going to restrict trades for human review based on the money amounts, they need to be implementing a triage for these customers.  That means calling them up to confirm not putting their accounts on hold.

After this, it would be crazy for you to stay with them.  After simply hearing your story, I am absolutely never doing business with that company.  I do not even have much, though, but I want to make sure that if I ever do get a lot, it is not lost.  With other stories from people here, it is possible that they are trying to hold onto cash after losing money due to a hack like happened with MTGOX.  It is very alarming.

Why is this bad advice?  He should be looking at how much it would cost and evaluating options.  Then again, he is not in the same country as the company so I do not even know if legal options are available to him.  I used the word 'consider' since he should be researching the possibility.

If the expense is worth the enjoyment of the 'rush' then it is worth it.  That means that a $1 ticket for the big payout can be worth it.  Those $10 to $20 lottery tickets offer the same type of rush, though, and they are certainly not worth it.  These people can absolutely not afford it, and the people that cannot afford it are usually the ones playing.
