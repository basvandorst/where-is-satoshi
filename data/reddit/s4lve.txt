I don‘t know if they offer ordering a nano. But what they do offer is a download for Ledger Live, which is the desktop app you use to configure your nano (install apps for the different currencies and also for updating the nano‘s firmware). And I think this is the attack scenario here, tampering with the nano with this manipulated Ledger Live version. So my question is: Does anyone know if someone has managed to compromise the nano, e.g. by installing a malicious firmware?

In german that would be „orangene Pille“ instead of „orange pille“

this is just wrong. The amount of new bitcoin and the amount of transaction the network can handle is independent of the mining capacity by design.

When I search for „ledger hardware wallet“, this ad pops up. Clicking it takes me to a website with url legder.co, offering a download for ledger live (the ledger desktop app).
Has anyone an idea how this scam works? Are there any known fake versions of ledger live compromising the ledger device (e.g. by installing a hacked firmware)? Or is it just a version that changes the bitcoin address when sending BTC?
I really would like to know, but I don‘t dare to install that thing!

I wouldn’t be surprised if it plays out like this: the price stays in the 7k - 12k range for the next couple of months. Shortly before the halving, price spikes to somewhere around 15k. Then the halving comes and price drops to around 5k - 7k again. People say that there is no reason to panic because new ATHs are usually only reached many months after the supply shock. But price stays below 10k throughout 2020 and a good part of 2021 and the sentiment changes. More and more people will say that BTC had seen its top and will slowly die. Many people will lose hope. This is when the price starts to rise again, because smart investors will start to buy the bottom. Then fomo kicks in and price spikes we see a new ATH eventually.
These assumptions are based on the experience that the market almost always does the opposite of what people expect.
But as there are many (unforeseeable) factors that have a bigger effect on price than the halving, like countries banning crypto or creating more on-ramps (digital $ and/or €), I just stick to my plan and buy more when the price dips or crashes. And if BTC dies, my money will go down with it. I don‘t think this will happen, but if it does then so be it (I follow the rule that I never invest more than I can afford to lose).
About the halving being priced in or not: I think shortterm it might be priced in (people bought or will buy more than usual before the halving and less after the halving), but longtherm it can never be priced in because the decrease of supply due to the halving will be here to stay!

Sure! Just wondering how this scam version of ledger live works, because I always thought a ledger hw wallet was safe. And if it is safe, whats the point in creating a fake desktop app then?

Don‘t think your prediction holds, but still: Buy when there is blood in the streets! ��

Wouldn‘t a 40% correction be more like 8.4k?

Create wallets with electrum and give them the seed words on a piece of paper. Open the public address in a block explorer and generate a QR-Code containing that link and print that, too (so they can easily check their balances).
