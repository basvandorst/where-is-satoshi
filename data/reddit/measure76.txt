People who you can't link to are people you made up.

Not if they're just going to hodl the stuff and waiting for the value to get even higher. Once they decide to cash in 100% of their holdings, yeah, the value will collapse.

Who said this was the end of bitcoin?

You can have a working market with few individuals controlling everything, like a luxury goods store or... a ponzi scheme. In this case, a distributed one, which is something never seen before, so it's interesting. Eventually we'll run out of new people willing/able to pay a little bit more.

So just people you made up? OK, if it makes you feel better about your position, that's fine.

I think having a small amount of bitcoin could be fun, and as long as it has utility that's great. It can't be seen as a long-term investment, right now anybody has to be crazy to have a lot of value stored in bitcoin.

So Bitcoins should be exclusively minted by the government, with printing rates dynamically altered to keep the economy in check?

Well that is definitely not how USD works.

Oops. I sold a reddit once in exchange for the buyer placing some self-serve ads for another reddit.

Bitcoin curious here... never put money in but watch the markets from time to time...
How much does it cost in electricity terms to mine a bitcoin these days?
