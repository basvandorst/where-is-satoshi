Look at this loser, he's being a responsible adult and not buying into a super risky investment that could vanish into nothing before I even finish typing this sentence. Lets all point at him and laugh. 
To be clear that is all sarcasm, anyone who criticizes you for paying down your mortgage is probably not someone you want giving you advice. I think there's an argument to be made for investing if you believe you can get a better interest rate on the investment than your mortgage, which isn't too hard if you got your mortgage loan within the past 15 years; looking back it appears that in the 80s rates were 15+%, so paying the loan off might have been the better choice in the long run. 
Regardless, paying your mortgage down isn't a bad choice.

Every time asks me about BTC I try to include the example of morons taking out second mortgages but buy in and make clear the person understands that even if bitcoin skyrockets and you turn your $250,000 loan into $100,000,000 they'd be complete morons. 
Likewise I also make sure they understand that invest and later sell for a nice profit they should not be hard on themselves if they could have made more money. As in "oh no I turned $1,000 into $5,000 when I really wasn't comfortable with risking losing all of it at that point, but if I'd held on 2 more years I could have had $500,000" and then launching into a spiral of depression that potentially results in suicide. You shouldn't hate yourself for failing to be psychic, don't risk anything you're unwilling to lose and enjoy whatever gains you get if you get them.

Several years ago I did something similar. I was using a mobile wallet, and would transfer coin from my desktop wallet for selling on localbitoins. I'd manually type in the address into my browser and use the QR code on block explorer to confirm it was the right address. On one occasion I skipped the confirmation and sent it to the address that came up when I started typing it in Firefox. Turns out it was an address I'd pulled up previously that wasn't mine. Lost half a coin to that mistake

I keep telling everyone: even if taking out a third mortgage on your house works out for you and you become unimaginably wealthy, what you did was stupid and the wrong choice. If I make a bet and put my wife and kids up for human trafficking as collateral, just because I won the bet doesn't mean I'm a good guy. 
Dude I used to sell Bitcoin to via LocalBitcoins had a huge gambling problem and ended up giving me 10k worth of mining equipment in exchange for the 3k he owed me at the time because I stupidly fronted him a couple weeks in a row before getting a bit smarter(dumb, I know, if he'd skipped town I'd have deserved to lose that money).

What way do you propose? It has to have a block generation time of roughly 10 minutes whether all computing power in the world is being used for the process or if there's only a single Rasberry Pi someone rigged up to mine. What would allow that, while also making it hard for someone to get a lot of Bitcoin when they are the only one mining for six months to a year? I'm not sure how that could possibly be considered a dick move.
Also he almost certainly has nowhere near a third of all BTC that will ever exist.
:edit: just to clarify, I feel like the tone of the question was more aggressive/defensive than I intended. Sorry for that. I am curious if you have any rough idea of how that could have been avoided. He promoted it before going live with it, and regularly posted about it, with users sometimes popping in and out mining as they were checking it out but none stayed mining nonstop. I doubt it would have kicked off if Satoshi hadn't been running the network nonstop, and the consequence of that is he got a lot coins

And? That's like saying it takes 5 extra seconds to get into your house if you lock the deadbolt instead of securing your home by having your neighbor watch your house through his blinds, it's true but there's plenty of situations where it would be worthwhile to have that layer of security that doesn't depend on someone else. 
It's relatively easy to estimate the energy consumption of Bitcoin, but it's nearly impossible to estimate the energy consumption of other banking systems because it's a massive interconnected network connections. Figuring out how much power the banking system uses annually would be like someone handing you a 50 gallon barrel of spaghetti and meatballs and trying to figure out how many miles of spaghetti is in it. 
If we look at Wells Fargo, a quick Googling tells me WF has 6,314 branches worldwide. Assuming they have **no** other buildings or facilities(which they of course do) and that each branch uses exactly as much power as my home did on its highest month in the past year(1938 kwh) those Wells Fargo branches would consume 0.147 TWh. That is just the branches of a single bank alone, not counting any server facilities they run, or the corporation's headquarters or any other building they are operating and it all assumes they are using the same amount of power as a single family dwelling. Wells Fargo is bank with the most branches, but there's like ninety thousand more in the US alone(according to my Googlings)


Unrelated. You could run Bitcoin at full capacity on a single server too. The processing power isn't there for efficiently conducting transactions, it's there to provide security, the more decentralized power behind the network the more difficult it becomes to attack the network. 


Imagine the Federal Reserve making the following proposal: figure out the composition of this special paper that no other paper ever feels quite like, and on it print a series of extremely fine lines in a specific sequence and include numerous security features(some unknown to the public) and you will now have a hundred bill. A means of proving that a transaction is happening with legitimate, non-counterfeit currency isn't a lottery or contest.


What? Is Bitcoin pretending to be USD?


Not erasing old transactions is what I assume you mean. 


You just said yourself in your sentence that your bank can change it. Even if they are legally required not to, that doesn't mean they won't or a massive glitch wouldn't cause it to wipe out your information. Maybe what you're saying is they wouldn't let that stand, but that is not the same as immutability.


But they could. Just like Twitter doesn't disable accounts for no reason until a disgruntled employee on their last day of work deleted Trump's account. Being required to do something is not the same as giving them that power. If I held a sword over your head you wouldn't be comforted by me saying I'm legaly bound not to split your skull open.


To a degree, but 5-7 years gets stored generally off the bat. The company probably stores longer, and it's possible that the various NSA data retention facilities will store data even longer(I vaguely remember reading about a datacenter built to store information for a century, but can't find that anymore). The problem isn't that this data is stored, the problem is that it is all connected to my identity and I had no control over it or who it was shared with at any point unless you want to suggest that I simply not use the internet, phones, banks, or anything else that is more or less needed to get and retain a job these days.
 


I have read this a crapload of times and can't figure out what you're trying to say. A smart water heater isn't going to have the same proof of work needs to secure it as a monetary transaction will, and the risks associated with smart devices wouldn't necessarily have the same need for decentralization of the blockchain as "smart money" would. Even then, the obvious solution is to not take part inthe Internet of Things. Unlike online banking, phone service, etc you **can** opt-out of the IoT without any significant losses to your wallet or employability, and if you are forced by your landlord to use a smart device because he decided it would be more efficient you can opt to not connect it to a network.

Fair enough. I have a few "commemorative bullions" that are just garbage metal with a few cents worth of gold foil embedded into the design, but there's clearly no way I could verify the amount was the 0.0000001oz or whatever(that's not me being a smartass, I am agreeing that a normal person couldn't do that or be bothered to)
 That's basically why the gold standard became a thing. You could have X amount of gold and then create currency divisible by as much as you wanted(you could have a coin worth 0.0000000000000001 if you needed to) so long as you only created currency worth up to the amount of gold you have. 
I think the temptation to make more is why gold failed, not so much the indivisibility of gold itself.

Seems like that is likely a huge factor. Checking [Census]( info ([link 2]( on the subject, it looks like in 1973(earliest I was able to find data for) 89% of single family home new constructions were smaller than 2,400sqf and around 1,200,000 were built that year. Likewise, in 2017 only 49% of new construction single family homes were under 2,400sqf and 795,000 were built. 
While the number built is lower if you look at the tables in those Census reports(pages 274 and 337 respectively) new constructions dropped off significantly after 2006/2007 due to the housing bubble, but the trend was clearly happening before the crash when the housing market was better. It seems to make sense that if the average size of the home doubles the average cost in terms of median salary would also nearly double.
I actually bought a small house built in the 70s for less than half the median price.
For cars I'd say you have to consider what is now added in(by order of government agencies) that is bumping the cost up. I have no idea where this person got the price of bread and eggs. I don't know geographically where that price is from, but it's double what I see at my local stores.
I'm not saying I disagree with the premise, but the biggest items on this list(home, rent, car) are things that you get a lot more from now than you did in 1967 either in terms of sheer size or capabilities/safety features that weren't standard before and are now required. The food seems to be vastly inflated prices. I'd have gone with average college tuition rather than Harvard, the effect would be virtually the same and it'd exemplify the excessive inflation that college tuition is going through.

Correlation vs causation. The cost of electricity expended follows the price, not the other way around. If the value of Bitcoin dropped to $1.00 the hash rate would plummet because it was no longer profitable to spend $3,000 a month in electricity to get $200 worth of btc.

If you can, find someone who quit smoking already. For everyone else you know they'll usually ask once or twice how it's going and go "that's great"  because from their perspective quitting smoking is a one time event and not a constant thing you're dealing with. Just having someone who gets that can vastly improve your chances of quitting.
Also: there is no "maybe just one cigarette." One cigarette is all it takes to go back to smoking a pack a day again. Within a week or two your cravings will be purely psychological; but if you struggle, for me personally nicotine patches helped a lot by giving me a buffer of a few months to break the habit before addressing the nicotine addiction aspect. You're going to be coughing shit up for the next few months, once that clears a whole bunch of health benefits start piling on. 
Finally: I'm somewhere around 4 years into having quit(I have the exact date written down on the inside flap of the last pack I bought) and as far as I can tell the smoking dreams never stop, I have them still at least once every couple months; don't let them get you down.

Aaaaand I misread that as "I'm panicked because I don't want to get married."  I just wrote a long treatise about why leading someone to believe you want to marry them probably makes you a huge ass. Turns out I was the huge ass the whole time. Below is different advice.
 You're on your way to marriage with this woman? I actually might have experience that is helpful for you. I bought a house 6 months into my relationship with the woman who is now my wife. I'd saved for the down payment long before I met her, it was a financial choice completely independent of my relationship with her(though I would be lying if I said wanting to seem impressive hadn't motivated me through the process). She looked at houses with me and helped me refine what I was looking for, but from the get-go I made clear that this was MY decision; despite the fact that we were confident we were getting married if our relationship didn't work out I was the one on the hook for the mortgage, so it had to be a choice I wouldn't regret. 
After signing the paperwork the decision over how to handle moving in together was similar, we treated it like we were roommates, with her paying half of the utilities and what we decided was a fair rate for rent. That way, if we parted ways I wouldn't feel like she had lived in my house rent free and she wouldn't feel like she'd been tricked into paying my mortgage. Not the most romantic solution, but the one least likely to make either of us feel used in a worst case scenario situation.
I assume you've had at least a few finances talk, I would talk with her about how you don't feel that would be a wise financial decision and thought that by the time it happened you'd have more Bitcoin in your possession so it wouldn't be the entirety of your holdings. I suspect she'd understand if presented in a reasonable and honest way. If you guys are going to get married it's both your future

He definitely is.


To which I pretty much say the same thing I say to people suggesting putting their house, kids' college fund, retirement money, etc on the line to buy more bitcoin: if you bet your family's financial stability on Bitcoin even if you succeed and become unimaginably wealthy what you did was still stupid...you just got lucky enough to succeed. Diversifying your portfolio is a concept that exists to minimize this exact sort of risk.

I've never really understood the logic behind those laws. In times of inconsistent or extremely low supply and extreme demand raising the price is the only means businesses have to slow demand down to keep a small portion of the population from hording. In an extreme hypothetical example: I have 50 gallons of the only clean water on an island with 40 families that just experienced a major catastrophe cutting us off from the outside world. I'm reasonably confident that since the storm has passed, boats are starting to run, and our highway service is clearing the roads off tonight I will get a shipment tomorrow, but with the communication situation being what it is I have no clue and regardless I can't help anyone with promises of water tomorrow maybe.
 I keep my water priced what it always is and one guy comes in and clears me out. I now have 39 families without water. If I limit the purchase to one gallon per customer that guy comes in then his wife, then each of 3 kids, and 7 other families do the same...now I have 30 families who'll go thirsty tonight. The ONLY way I can see in this situation to keep someone from finding a way around the system is raising the price to a point where they are forced to seriously consider how much they truly need to get through a day or so. 
The only non-price-gouging thing that jumps to mind is to charge the higher price, but provide a voucher to refund the extra money after the crisis.  I think that businesses shouldn't price gouge, but I feel like there's potentially dangerous problems caused by forbidding it. This only applies to necessities, I think the accusations people have made about Uber "price gouging" on New Years Eve in New York City was just insane.
\* My example isn't entirely realistic because in a community that small I'd probably know that guy, his wife, and three kids and wouldn't be fooled by that trick; but I think the underlying concept is accurate.

Based on his interview with Reason I get the impression he thinks that it's ideal to work within the system in the hopes of causing it to improve while also developing in a way that there is literally nothing that can be done to stop you from owning a firearm if the system doesn't change or gets worse. I personally agree with that and think that Bitcoin fills a similar role for financial freedom, but I understand there's an argument to be had there. I am not trying to start an argument, I'm just explaining what my impression of Cody Wilson's beliefs are and why he would want to fight that battle based on my impression of his beliefs.

Not necessarily an imbecile, I think he's simply not quite able to see the potential of the network effect. Hence his "the internet is a fad" statement back in the 90s(which he now says was intentionally meant to be provocative), the reasoning he used there was that making it easier to communicate doesn't really mean much when most people don't have anything to say to one another. 
That wasn't wrong, if the internet had failed to advance past essentially being a paperless fax machine it probably would not be the absolutely essential part of modern life that it is; but that prediction fails to see that once a certain level of saturation was reached it would fundamentally change the way communication happens. People having a little website with a bunch of information about themselves on it that people they know can look at like the world's worst baseball cards doesn't sound impressive until everyone you know is using it and it's called Facebook.
I'd say Bitcoin is similar. When it was just some nerds trading computer pixels for alpaca socks and heroin it sounded stupid to anyone who didn't see the potential of an accounting system that has built into itself a verification for each transaction's validity. Now we're just starting to see the potential. I'm sure this is a metaphor people use a lot, but we're in the Myspace phase of crypto.
I think economists collectively are slow to see the potential of new technology because economics doesn't change much on the whole.

This is the only point of yours that I would argue. I would argue that when most people mention the profitability of bitcoin for early investors, they're referring to the buyers who got involved before bitcoin even broke one cent, when profitability meant seeing a return of hundreds or even thousands of times your initial investment. I honestly wouldn't be remotely surprised to find out that at least one of the current bitcoin millionaires is some young kid who did a good job backing up the bitcoin wallet he forgot had a few dollars that had been intended for spending on Silk Road. Whereas now, the returns we're really hoping to get are four to five times out initial investment.

You also can't beat yourself up for not being psychic. Yeah, OP could have had more if he'd held on, but assuming that he didn't sell at a loss he made a profit and used it for something that will bring him happiness. If Bitcoin had reversed direction and was currently valued at $0 he'd be relieved. At the time he had no idea(and despite all the circlejerking around these parts there's still a very real possibility that bitcoin will plummet into oblivion and none of us realize it's coming) and felt the risk of holding Bitcoin was outweighed by the prospect of home ownership.
Not knocking anyone who wants to hold instead, just more trying to point out that if you or anyone reading this ever finds themselves becoming depressed over lost potential gains to look at it from that perspective. Also as a (not paid for with Bitcoin) homeowner: owning a house is awesome.

Lawful and following the law aren't the same on the D&amp;D alignment scale, at least as I've always used them. Lawful tends to be more along the lines of having a set of immovable core beliefs or moral code that is followed even at the expense of one's own self-interest. In this case, creating a rigid, impossible to break system as a weapon against what you see as a corrupt and broken system seems the definition of "lawful"

I'm not defending either of them, but I think something a lot of people tend to forget is how young and inexperienced a lot of the big name bitcoin entrepreneurs are; some of them started businesses that they probably never expected to bring in profits big enough to buy a case of beer, and suddenly they're running multimillion dollar corporations.
That obviously does not excuse stealing and/or being the cause of the loss of millions of dollars, but it does put Karpeles' behavior into a completely different light. He's not a monstrous douchebag using Twitter to rub his own freedom in the faces of people he stole millions of dollars from, he's a man with a baffling lack of self-awareness who was clearly in way over his head and wasn't smart enough find better people to handle things while he built a pillow fort out of money.

For the love of god, don't put all you have in Bitcoin. I don't know how many times it has to be said: don't bet more than you can afford to lose.
I have, in just the past 18 months or so, have seen 3 separate people in my area lose more than $20,000 in bitcoins each due to excessive encryption on their backup wallets causing them to lose access, failing to backup at all, and just all around poor decisions with their finances(buying at the absolute peak of an obvious bubble).
When you buy bitcoin (along with all forms of investment and/or gambling) with the intent of holding in the hopes of seeing a return, you should do so under the assumption that you will never see that money again or be able to use it in a meaningful way. Do your best to strategically sell off at somewhat opportune moments (I keep a running tab of the weighted value of some of my wallets and sell when I can make more than 15% of the deal). If you can get yourself to the point where you are accumulating bitcoin savings at little to no loss to yourself, then even if bitcoin went to $0.00 your biggest loss would be your time, and if you can secure a meager profit off the whole thing, then that's even better

Judging from some basic math based on Overstock's [Financial statements]( 0.1% of their month revenue would round down to about $100,000 a month. Extrapolating out from the number of BTC sent in the [past 24 hours]( there's roughly $6.6 billion worth of bitcoins moved in a single month. Given that the vast majority of that $6.6 billion is shuffling money between the same owner(moving from an exchange wallet to a personal one, tumbling, and so on) it would be difficult to judge the exact size of the bitcoin economy since there's a significant amount of white noise in the transaction information. We'll assume that after buying or receiving bitcoins via an exchange, the recipient will transfer them to another wallet(very few people keep their bitcoins where they land since MtGox), so for every exchange between parties the bitcoins would have moved 3 times, making max for the market cap to be $2.2 billion. At the absolute highest, Overstock is receiving .000045% of the monthly transaction volume of a form of currency whose market cap is 0.0049% that of the [USD]( that is used by roughly 0.3% as many people. Which seems to be exactly how you would expect it to work out.
TL;DR: obscure method of transmitting money is still obscure, and once the initial excitement died down things get closer to the actual market size. For a company like OS, this isn't much, but it seems comparable to the percentage of the size of the bitcoin as it stands right now.

The whole "bitcoins are hard to get now" argument doesn't really fly with me. Mining isn't the only way to get Bitcoins. Sell something, earn Bitcoins by doing something other than maintaining the bitcoin network, if helping the network isn't profitable enough for your tastes.
Additionally: the earliest of the early adopters took greater risks and thus reaped greater rewards. I'm not sure why them having more than someone who showed up later to the party somehow lessens the advantages of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. That's like Zuckerberg saying the internet is worthless to him because Google is the most visited website.

There are plenty of companies accepting bitcoins as payment from customers already.

I would say no more than credit cards or cash incite violence. Sure, there could be some people who lose thousands or more due to something like that, but I think more adoption would increase the pressure to split your holdings between numerous wallets, even among the less technical users. However, I also understand that with bitcoin there isn't nearly as much psychological revulsion at the idea of carrying thousands of dollars on your person as there is with cash. Overall, I think we are a very long time away from bitcoin being even remotely popular enough for this to be even a little possible. As it stands right now, if you were to randomly target people, the best reaction you could hope for when demanding their private keys is that they offer to wait 10 minutes before the report their BMW as stolen. Even specifically targeting users through sites like localbitcoins wouldn't be particularly profitable for the sheer amount of risk involved.

**Spend - 10% of my btc, but never more than $300 unless I am saving for something specific**
This category is for buying things with btc and/or spending as I please.
**Sell now - 15% - 25%**
I sell this off through Localbitcoins for cash which I generally will split up similarly to how I split up my BTC
**Sell later - 15% - 25%, but generally no more than $5,000**
This category is for selling within 90 days or so, and I set a few coins aside for selling during the next bubble.
**Long term hold - 40% - 60%**
These are the coins I have no intention of touching until bitcoin either drops to zero or I decide to move on to other things.

Personally, I've assumed that the vast majority of traders on LocalBitcoins who sell online are doing this. I've seen plenty of the online traders who will sell at a markup and are listed as having an average response time of less than half an hour on hundreds of exchanges. There's no way that's not an automated trading bot.
I would also assume that legally, yes you need a license for any amount as you are exchanging currency. However, whether or not this will ever be enforced for all but the largest traders is yet to be seen.

That seems to ignore the fact that a large number of us have made significantly more money than we've spent. If Bitcoin were to vanish right now, I would be sad but I would overall have made thousands of dollars thanks to it.
Not to mention the fact that becoming more financially aware, I have started saving much more heavily and righting the mistakes I made with my credit when I had just become an adult (i.e. thanks to this mindset, I have successfully gotten rid of all of my debt over the past 2.5 years). If something were to happen, people would almost certainly laugh at people like me for falling for the scam, but given that I would have made lots of money and learned how to properly manage my finances...I'm not sure I would agree with those people because I was smart enough not to be more than I could afford to lose.

Instead of having someone go through an exchange and put in a lot of information that may be somewhat scary if you're still slightly on the fence about bitcoin or using Localbitcoins to meet a stranger IRL, you can put a few dollars into a machine and **BAM** you've got bitcoins in a very non-threatening way.

Ah. I misunderstood your post entirely. I thought this was more of a "hippies talk about changing the world but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad" type post(oh Cartman, how I love you) that disregarded a lot of what those hippies **did** manage to accomplish.
That said, let's assume that you are correct, that Bitcoin does **not** change the world like so many of us want/hope it to. That's surprisingly alright. I don't think there's really going to be any going back on it at this point, Bitcoin is going to be a thing for a very long time, an eternity in Internet years. It may never have mainstream adoption by most of society, and we may never get to see Kim Kardashian crying about losing her private keys, but now that it exists there will be a community of people that believe in freedom and privacy who will use and accept bitcoin. 
I would go so far as to say that a majority of major online retailers (and hopefully wholesalers, otherwise the price will never go back up) will accept Bitcoin in the near future either directly or indirectly through services such as Paypal. This is due to the fact that the cost of implementing Bitcoin as a payment option online is incredibly trivial, and retailers are willing to step a little out of their way to help customers give them money. Without *mass* adoption(for the sake of argument, I'll call mass adoption of Bitcoin 5+% of online non-black market retail transactions), we won't likely see Bitcoin in too many major brick and mortar establishments due to the cost of integrating that into what may be their own proprietary register software.
TL;DR: I think that even if Bitcoin doesn't change the world, it's around to stay, even if it's just for a relatively small, niche group of people who see its value.

Based on some half remembered stats I put together about 2 years ago, about 50% of gold mined/recycled is turned into some form of storage(bars, coins, etc), around 40% is turned into jewelry or something whose purpose is to look pretty and be made out of gold, and the remaining 10-ish% is used for actual applications.

More retailers are accepting it but very few wholesalers are. Since retailers can't do much with Bitcoins right now, they cash them out immediately, putting downward pressure on the price. Once wholesalers start accepting bitcoin as well, the retailers will hold onto more of their coins, relieving some of the downward pressure.
That's my theory, it's probably just as flawed as everyone else's

I took it as well, and that's actually part of the reason I brought it up. Personally, I would say that it is the Bitcoin equivalent of A+; a basic overview that proves you didn't just fall off the turnip truck. I would withhold judgement until 1: their 'expert' level certification comes out and 2: we have some idea of what percentage of people fail that cert. 
Back to my Bitcoin vs A+ comparison, I would say that I studied more for A+; but only because I hadn't completely immersed myself in a community of people who obsessively talked about everything on the A+ cert; whereas with Bitcoin this is stuff I've spent the past 2 years learning. Honestly, the information on the BIP0032, 38, 70, etc was all completely new to me; so in a sense the cert did help me know what I don't know.

You just need to be more disciplined. **That** is the easiest way. Trying to do this could go wrong for you in so many ways.
First off: you'll still have to exercise discipline, as you'll have to set a password, unless you intend to also trust an algorithm to generate one randomly(a glitch could ensure you never get your password back), so you'll have to exercise the same amount of discipline as you would if you just decided not to do it. 
Alternatively: if that calculator is even slightly fucky, you may never get your password back. 
I promise you, that if you try to do this, you will end up being like that guy who threw away his hard drive and searched a landfill for it; except you'll get a lot less sympathy because you knowingly did this to yourself.

He encrypted the hard drive, installed a virtual machine with a truecrypt HD on it, then encrypted the file on the virtual machine with an encryption key he only had stored on that same virtual machine. He then decided that writing down his very long and complicated password would be insecure so he memorized it. I would say he had at a minimum 100 points of failure, any one of which could destroy his ability to get to his bitcoins, the first and foremost being that he only had one backup of his wallet and the second being that he was not reasonably certain he remembered the password correctly anyway.
What you described sounds fairly safe to me, I'm not a huge fan of uploading wallets to clouds like that, but if you encrypted it securely and used strong paswords for both the encryption as well as your cloud account you should be good. I might be misreading what you're saying, but I would be somewhat nervous about storing a copy of your password directly on your computer(at the very least encrypt it if you *really* want to keep it on there) though you may have just been referring to a copy of the wallet. Something I also do is generate paper wallet backups and store them in my fire/water-proof safe.
You also want to be sure to have a few flash drives tucked away with any private keys used to encrypt the files. Under no circumstances would I advise storing encryption keys on a cloud, especially one that also stores files it was used to encrypt, store them on flash drives in a fire/water proof chest (available at Walmart for less than $50) along with a printed copy of the private key so that in the event that every backup of the keys fails you can still type it in by hand to restore it.

The estimates I've seen are based on the fact that there are 38,399 that have exactly 50 bitcoins in them that have not be touched since the bitcoins were mined. Assuming that every single one of those is lost forever, that's already 1,919,950 bitcoins lost out of 13,311,100 (14.4%), and that's just the obvious candidates for lost coins. I would guess 40% is a very conservative estimate for lost coins right now.

First off, I'm not sure how the size of the network affects how many coins are getting dumped, unless maybe you're talking about miners constantly putting their profits back into the bitcoin economy to increase their own hashing power in the hopes of making a profit. Which is a premise I would reject outright, as the number of coins being spent and sold out is much more greatly affected by sites like Silk Road and Overstock than the state of the mining community.
Regardless, that's not really how human nature works. If the rest of you want to arbitrarily run the network with a 333mh/s miner, I'll buy a few hundred cheap jalapeno miners off eBay and rule the network. The idea that someone should choose to not act to their own advantage is insane. That's more or less the sort of thing that Bitcoin sets out to resolve, people acting in their own interest helps the network and makes it less susceptible to a 51% attack(among other things) rather than hurt it. 
A common term thrown out to describe the current state of the mining community is "arms race" which is preposterous. Right now, it looks like the Bitcoin network is disobeying Moore's Law, but that isn't the case. Bitcoin was initially throttled by a lack of optimization in the hardware used to mine, then other hardware was discovered to be more efficient, and finally existing technology began being used to build specialized hardware. As of yet, there hasn't really been any true innovation to increase the network power, the mining hardware is just catching up to the current technology, and as we get closer to "now" with the speed and tech, the network hashing power will start coming into line with Moore's Law. 
Personally, I would say that the biggest cause right now for the drop is increased adoption at the retail level(Overstock and soon to be Braintree for example) without much adoption at the wholesale level. This is forcing retailers to cash out a large chunk of the Bitcoins they earn, causing the price to drop. Once more wholesale suppliers accept Bitcoin as a payment method, retailers will be able to keep more of the Bitcoins they earn to pay for things on the back end of their business, keeping Bitcoins within their own little economy, increasing the scarcity for anyone who shows up late to the party and thus driving the price back up. 
If you want to see the price skyrocket, get more wholesalers to accept Bitcoin and offer discounts to retailers paying in Bitcoin.

No. You should not have 'faith' in a means of exchange, especially one that isn't backed up by insurance like your money in the bank is. I know it's a controversial statement to make around here, but if 1btc = 1btc, then that clearly means $1 = $1 regardless of inflation and for the bulk of my wealth that I am unwilling to lose I store it in the bank with their insurance on loss. 
Don't get me wrong, I have a metric shit-load of my cash in bitcoin, but thanks to clever trading, mining, and sales via sites like BitMit, I have cashed out to the tune of a very nice profit. If every single wallet of mine were to get hacked right now, or Bitcoin were to vanish into thin air, I would be very depressed but I would have come out ahead of where I started.
TL;DR: Never have faith, don't bet on Bitcoin being a revolution, and especially don't bet more than you can lose.

throwing your money at something that there is ~99.9999% chance you will never be able to use in a meaningful way is a greater risk throwing money at something that has a 0% chance of you being unable to use it in a meaningful way. 
The difference is that one of those things was, at the time, the equivalent of throw your money into the garbage disposal and hoping that one day it would be revealed that people who threw money in garbage disposals were entered into a secret raffle; whereas the other is the equivalent of exchanging your money for Canadian dollars right before entering Canada. 
The "bitcoins are hard to get now" argument doesn't really fly. Mining isn't the only way to get Bitcoins. Sell something, earn Bitcoins by doing something other than maintaining the bitcoin network, if helping the network isn't profitable enough for your tastes.

I feel like this stretches the definition of "credit" while narrowing the definition of "barter" to prove a very specific point. If I'm reading this correctly, the author is defining the following exchange as credit but not bartering: you give me your goat today and I promise to to share my cow with you once it's fully grown. I'm not really sure how that could be seen as not bartering just because the trade doesn't happen simultaneously. I suspect that when bartering that sort of delayed trade happens frequently as it is unlikely that both parties will have their items at the same time(hence why we invented money) which is why most bartering economies stay fairly small as there's a need for implicit trust between parties. I reject the idea that bartering and credit are mutually exclusive concepts.

The best explanation I was given for the Dunning Kruger Effect is that the knowledge required to have a skill is also the knowledge required to evaluate that skill, so the layman has a difficult time seeing his own flaws while the more knowledgeable will focus primarily on their own flaws.

First and foremost, this ignores the network effect and the fact that as the community gets larger the risk of a 51% attack lowers until it is nearly nonexistent. In the event of a successful 51% attack, there's honestly not much an intentional attack would be capable of doing a double spend while preventing confirmation on other blocks before the blockchain was forked and they lost their advantage. For that reason is would make little sense for a mining pool to execute a 51% attack as it would ultimately put them at no tactical advantage, it would only make sense for a single entity to do so, and at this point getting the processing power to do so would cost to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, possibly even 1+ billion...all for the sake of doing a single double spend and disrupting the blockchain for a brief amount of time.

I have a degree in computer science and it still took a couple of times being exposed to Bitcoin for me to get it. Granted, it wasn't quite as prevalent as it is now so the first few times I looked into it all I saw was what looked like an interesting thought experiment. I think it was the bubble in April 2013 that caused me to stop and read the white paper and seriously look at what it was.

I think the argument here is that if we see a "Bitcoin" not as the 21 million limit, but rather as the smallest unit possible(currently a Satoshi) adding decimal places allows the value of a Bitcoin to rise farther than it practically could have before(which would mean the market cap exceeded the entire GDP of the USA).

Hal had the fairly specific background that would make him a good candidate, but I would say that Nick Szabo does as well. They both having been writing about e-currencies for decades and have the knowledge to implement one with the right epiphany.
If Satoshi was really as concerned with his own anonymity as he said he was, it would be odd to send the first transaction to himself and publicly announce that his alter ego was sending it to his real identity. Hal-Satoshi could have simply said "sending coins to a different wallet address to test the functionality of the blockchain." It seems rather odd for someone who was otherwise a very smart man to make such a weird move when he was trying to stay anonymous. 
That is my pitch for Nick Szabo over Hal Finney. Change MY mind.

1: you would have sold long before the ATH. 
2: If you weren't the type of person who would turn a $10 investment into $2800 at $14/btc or $50,000 at $250/btc it is very unlikely that when that $10 investment can become $4,000,000 you'd sell either.

I'd say there's an argument to be made the justification for their reward is what they did helping establish Bitcoin as more legitimate and become what it is today. Does that school [investing]( $15,000 in Snapchat justify it's $20+ million reward for it? Being that article says they have another investment worth $2+ million it seems like the $15k risk wasn't that much of a risk for them. Investors are rewarded with profit for the risk and the later users are rewarded with a stable platform for exchange. 
And I'd say most really early adopters sold out when the $30 and $250 bubbles rolled around with a handful of stragglers hloding until the $1200. It's very unlikely we'll see anyone stumbling out of the blue suddenly remembering they'd bought $50 worth of bitcoin at a cost of $0.0002 per coin or anything.

I love how the style of his writing in that example isn't the least Satoshi-esque thing about it. It's mind blowing that he can be taken seriously by some people when the content of his writing from roughly the time that Satoshi was about to drop the white paper is the polar opposite of every belief Satoshi acted out.
:Edit: It's actually even worse than that now that I reflect for a bit. He's openly hostile to the idea of "hiding behind" anonymity, calling it "the shield of cowards." Satoshi, on the other hand, had no real reason to hide behind anonymity in the beginning; if anything I think from the perspective of the majority of people he was incentivized to publish under his real name. At the time what he did was a really clever peer2peer way of creating digital scarcity, but it had no real value beyond the academic achievement. Satoshi would have gain significant academic credibility for solving a real problem even without Bitcoin specifically ever taking off. However, he chose to forgo that reputation boost because he saw the potential and was a true believer in the economic power of what he'd created. The only reason to step forward now is if he wants to bring the odds of him being murdered up to nearly 100%.

I'd say it's not really a fair comparison either. If I make a generic clonecoin and start it up for 5 minutes then say my coin has 100% uptime vs Bitcoin's 99.99% that doesn't mean anything worthwhile. The USD has been up 100% of the time since bitcoin's creation, while bitcoin has only been up 3.31% of the time since the dollar's creation. And my "100% uptime" imaginary cryptocurrency that's been alive for 5 minutes was only up for 0.0076% of bitoin's lifespan and 0.000004% of the USD. 
Uptime is important but so is the overall lifespan. And that's not addressing the point that even a hyperinflated currency can be used when it's not being made anymore(even if only as fire starters) but when Bitcoin goes down it can't really do much of anything.

Fair enough. Volatility is a legitimate concern. In my experience I've found Bitcoin seems to have a similar level of volatility to many other assets but compressed 10 to 20 times. As in, the price shifts that Bitcoin does in 1 year Gold seems to do in 15. I don't think the two are correlated or anything, but I think the pattern they seem to follow is more dictated by collective psychology than anything else, and one major side effect of social media and the interconnectedness the internet brings us is condensing the collective societal psychology down.


I'm not sure how volatility translates to illegal activity. I'll give you that a lack of transparency causes that, but I'm not sure what government backed currencies have  less of than transparency.

Yeah that's fairly stupid. Cash out enough that if Bitcoin vanished tomorrow you'd still be happy with your earnings...maybe not happy but not as unhappy. The advice I give to everyone interested in Bitcoin who I speak with: buy what you can afford, and then try to sell some during a bubble and buy back on the drop. Take the money you made from that and put it in a jar. That's your bitcoin money. You want to buy more bitcoin, use the jar money. 
After your initial investment if you do really well you can still make plenty of money and if you do really badly if you stick with that process your maximum losses is what you already decided you could afford to lose. Yeah, you might lose out on potential profits but you're more likely losing out of massive losses, because no matter how good you think you are at investing, when you see your $300,000 home refinancing loan plummet $100,000 in the span of 3 hours there is a good chance that you will panic and either ultimately lose money or not make much money because you were freaking out. It happens to professional stock brokers all the time, humans are wired to panic when we see our resources are dwindling even if we believe they will come around. Just this week it happened to me when I moved my BCC to an exchange and instead of setting a number or a fading sell point like I have in the past I sat and watched the price too closely and started to panic when it dropped and sold all my BCC.

Nope. Pretty sure he meant -273 Kelvin. You can get things way colder than 0 Kelvin. Essentially once you reach "absolute zero" if you continue to remove energy from the system it becomes self-sustaining and begins absorbing heat but paradoxically becoming colder by doing so(much in the same way that pouring water onto the sun would cause it to become hotter). Unfortunately, once we achieve this system, mining will become very cheap but as the zone of -273 Kelvin expands the universe will slowly be reduced to a frozen wasteland.

To elaborate on someone else's comment. I'd say that John Oliver is an interesting fellow and will often make really good pieces but has a bad habit of clearly pushing a narrative when it suits the message he wants to deliver. Sidestepping around some of the more controversial topics he's covered because arguing about our individual views on guns/Trump/abortion/death penalty/etc isn't what this is about, one of the segments I felt was significantly more biased than it needed to be was the one about nuclear waste, it seemed like a lot of information was glossed over to push a very specific message. The same goes when contrasting the coverage of the RNC and the DNC. And then there's a segment regularly on the show that might as well be titled "we should stop this because it is the current year." 
Not saying I dislike the show, but it definitely shows its biases at times and can present that bias with a lot of arrogance and disdain for the other side of the debate. I loved the civil forfeiture segment as well as the Snowden interview. I have not yet had a chance to watch this particular segment, but from the chatter around the internet water cooler it appears to be fairly good.

Yep. Go to the bank and withdraw $2,000. From that put the price of one bitcoin in a jar and check the price a few times a day, adding coins in or taking them away as the price fluctuates. Every time you take money out, imagine that you might never get it back. How much of a drop is going to make you panic and "sell" that Bitcoin back to prevent you from losing everything? Over what timeline are you willing to keep that up at the risk of that money? The last people who bought during an all time high price had to wait three years before they could possibly have turned a profit and I would bet most of them panicked long before then because human beings aren't psychologically prepared to see their savings slowly trickle off like that without trying to stop it. 
That's not an endorsement of hodling that's me saying myself and all other human beings are shit at investing(which is why most investors don't [beat the market]( very often). Many of the the people who became "Bitcoin millionaires" did so by forgetting they were holding, and most of them sold off at the $250 and $1200 bubbles to people who would go on to sell those coins after the bubble popped. 
TL;DR: don't buy at an all time high, and only buy as much as you are willing to lose. Anyone who tells you Bitcoin is a sure thing is either a liar, naive, or blinded by the fact that they got really really lucky; they are the equivalent of Justin Bieber telling you to blow off everything else and make videos of you singing for Youtube.

Back then the entire network hashing power would have been less than a single $500 ASIC you can get now, meaning a laptop had a legitimate chance of mining blocks regularly solo. The reward sounds huge now, but when 1 bitcoin was worth a few cents that didn't mean much

I remember reading the original paper and thinking that it was an easy to read well explained paper. That entire blog is rambling and incoherent. If Wright came up with the original concept(he didn't given that he doesn't seem to understand it himself) he clearly had somebody else do the write up for him because the style is entirely different.

I believe to ensure that it is the absolute right move as far as the will of the people goes, and also to prevent any attempts at breaking off as a result of a fork will greatly affect the network. If 25% of Bitcoin miners chose to walk away from Bitcoin the effect on the network would be catastrophic. Additionally, I think it prevents a coalition from swaying Bitcoin down a road not in the interest of the community...kind of a democratic version of preventing a 51% attack.
 While a 51% attack would likely be difficult to convince large scale miners to cooperate on, as doing so is very clearly directly against their best interests(it undermines the thing they've invested vast amounts of money in). Likewise, I think you could potentially convince or pay off the largest pools to favor a protocol change that they may not fully understand(i.e. it doesn't seem like this should be a problem so I'll go with it). You could probably convince 50% or even 75% of the hashing power to do this, but getting to that 95% consensus would require you to bribe practically everyone. 
The counter to this, of course, is that a 95% consensus requirement means 6% can keep something from going through.

How is that specifically a thing of note? Aren't there a bunch more markets like it still around?
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:48:44
That still sounds like it doesn't make much sense to me. For example: the police break into my home illegally while I'm away because they think my neighbor stashed guns in my walls, it feels like it shouldn't matter whether he hid guns in my walls if they obtained the evidence illegally regardless of whose rights were violated. 
That said, the law is often obscenely complicated. I can see there being an argument for it being that way, I am likely just thinking this through incorrectly.

Not being an ass when I ask this because I am confident that you are correct, but have you actually cracked it open to verify that the design available online and the design inside the case are the same? If I were planning on secretly putting a transmitter into a device I wouldn't make a point to advertise its existence. 
That said, so it's clear I'm not concern-trolling or whatever that might be called I realize that would be much too risky a thing to do cause all it takes is one person to cut it open(and maybe you already CAN open the Trezor without any difficulty making verification easy..

True. Who the hell are these people? I don't necessarily follow the who's who of the Bitcoin community, but I have never heard of really any these people or the things they apparently founded.

"This is just the beginning" seems to be the Bitcoin community's response to every major upswing, it's this side equivalent to "Bitcoin is dead" the media likes to talk about on every major downswing. Bitcoin has a lot of potential, but I think everyone should temper their expectations. If Bitcoin's value plummeted to $0 tomorrow I would be depressed, but also happy knowing that overall I made quite a bit of money and have been careful never to put myself at a net loss

My general rule for alt-coins and sorting out my Roth IRA is not to buy something that's at an all time high(or even just an annual high). Sure, sometimes I miss out on big returns but more often than not I seem to save money.

To tie it back into the OP's custody battle metaphor: Miners and Developers are you mom and dad, who have decided to work out custody among themselves before actually filing for divorce. They keep sending you memes about concepts you with your child mind don't really understand(and they don't fully either) and both of them are promising to make you rich if you pick the right one. Being a child you want to make mom and dad happy, and don't know what to do being caught between the people you thought were both on your side.

I have a hard time believing that it's even close. On the site sQtWlgK listed it says average currencies have between 0.5 and 1.0 percent volatility. Don't get me wrong, I love bitcoin, but this is just silly.

No. The way nodes initialize, load the genesis block and then synchronize is done in a way that would cause all nodes to reject it if the genesis block were spent from. Sure, that could be modified at some point in the future, but given how much trouble getting any form of scaling implemented I doubt changing how nodes perceive the genesis block would ever fly.

It should be relatively trivial to code something like that. bitcoincharts gives historical values, I imagine one could quickly create a calculator to determine what raw value of a wallet at the time each transaction came in. Giving a more accurate depiction of the money if needed for reporting purposes.
I had considered trying to code something like that during the Silk Road trial to see if the 88 million dollar figure was really accurate, I suspect the vast majority of the master wallet's money came from a time when a $50 purchase on the site would have netted him several bitcoins at a time.

We generally colloquially refer to those pressure vibrations as "sound" and because things exist even when you don't perceive them that means pressure vibrations in air = sound. Because you know... things continue to exist(that is meant to be mildly snarky, not bitchy)

That's basically how I've always viewed the role of government within my own philosophy of libertarianism. The government's purpose is to ensure the gears of society turn freely, and there is room for debate about where the limitations on that should be. I'm inclined to think it's somewhere between completely hands-off and where we currently are in the USA(i.e. I think the US needs to reduce government right now, but not all of it).

Part of the problem is that the workforce essentially doubled in size as women entered the workforce and even more as outsourcing to other countries became cheaper. That's not a bad thing, but it definitely is going to have a huge effect on the value of certain types of labor.
\* I cannot emphasize enough, I'm not suggesting that women should be barred from the workforce or that we should isolate ourselves from the rest of the world; that would be a disaster.

the marketing team and the actual technical consultants for the production clearly didn't interact much. The show is significantly more accurate technically than your average tv show and if nothing else(at least what I remember from Season 1) all of the smart people talking to one another talk like smart people talk to each other instead of going out of their way to simplify and speak in metaphors for the audience's sake.
