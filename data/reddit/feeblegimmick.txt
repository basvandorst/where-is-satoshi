The trouble with bitcoin and why it has very little underlying value is that it's really easy to set up an alternative, i.e. all the alt-coins, of which there are over a thousand, that are simply better than it. 
Let's not pretend it's otherwise, bitcoin is very poor as a currency. What have you bought with it lately? It's slow, transaction costs are high, it doesn't scale, it's bad for the environment, you can't get refunds, it's too volatile, it's deflationary, hardly anywhere accepts it, you can get hacked, it might soon be illegal in many places, etc. 
It would only have underlying value if there weren't any alternatives and there were something you couldn't buy with any other currency. Fiat currencies have this because you have to pay taxes in that currency. Bitcoin has the fact that malware writers sometimes demand ransoms in it, but bitcoin isn't even very good at that because it's not truly anonymous.
The only thing bitcoin has going for it is that it was the first crypto-currency and therefore currently has the widest adoption and brand recognition. But people who actually want to use a digital currency will want one that is fit for purpose. Furthermore they don't really want to buy into a world where the Winklevosses (or the person who wrote the code for your alt-coin) start with all the money and there's no way of redistributing it.
If crypto-currencies take off then it's going to be in the form of government-backed, regulated coins, the hypothetical "Fedcoin" etc. This doesn't fit with Bitcoin's original ideals; bitcoin's ideals may have some residual value to some, but this might not be worth so much once there's a coin that really works better than current payment solutions (cash, Visa etc) and is government-backed.

I mean... if someone really wants to donate to them, they can sell the bitcoin and donate in fiat currency.
