I guess everyone has different goals. I want a digital currency to be convenient, the decentralization, or separation from banking and all the other features to me are just icing, they are great but not important to me. I would totally accept a digital currency that didn't have those features if it was convenient, I would *prefer* a decentralized currency backed by crypto etc. But that's secondary to me.
Things like android pay and google wallet and such to me are currently BETTER digital currency. Bitcoin has way more theoretical benefits, but it fails that the most important part. I will continue to follow it because I want it to work but it seems like most people here have differnet goals from mine.
@_date: 2016-08-15 07:01:43
That seems circular reasoning. Me using tor supports other using tor so we can all use tor...
What actual benefits do people get if I were to switch MY node to use tor. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 07:11:48
That's what I figured, but just wanted to make sure my on/off scheme wanst a negative somehow.
Been running this node are various times for ~5 years now. I only have 0.04 BTC, but I like the idea so I run a node.

I live in Tokyo. There is one bar that accepts bitcoin. I will stop in for a beer if I'm in that area, but I only ever own enough bitcoin to buy a beer or two. Because I don't see adoption rising. I don't see the community pushing for success. I see many members telling me I'm wrong for wanting to use it as a payment network. 
I have used it to send money to the US but then I put stuff into btc transfer and get my funds out of btc as soon as I possibly can. 
I try to do my part by spending btc where I can. It's just basically no where. Less then 0.1% of my spending. 
I think bitcoin is a great idea but I'm not going to use a currency that is LESS convenient just because it's it has some theoretical ideals. The point is it should be more convenient. I'll let a friend pay for his round at the bar by giving me 0.02 btc, because that is convenient, but then i realize how inconvenient it is for me to ever do anything more with those funds. 
Traveling abroad is not easier with btc. I went to Korea, and sure Seoul has a bitcoin center in downtown... But they were closed on weekends. Great have to use ane exchange dollars for won. Oh turns out there are way more exchanges for usual currency than the handful of btc ATMs... So how is btc easier when traveling?? It's the same story everywhere. I went to a conference last week in the UK. The city I was in had not btc ATMs.
I try. I do my best to use btc, spend it, embrace it. It's judt IS NOT more convenient. I have to really go out of my way to do anything useful with it. I want it to work but you are just lying to yourself if you think it's easy for very much right now. I already inconvenience my self to try to use the damn stuff because I am an idealist... But it is only ever going to be for idealists.

Sorry. It's going to turn off at night in summer. It's makes too much heat and it's 100% humidity and 30 degrees here. 
I agree it's not ideal to run only part time which is why I asked. the options are none or part time. So just wanted toakensure that having an unreliable node wasn't bad.
@_date: 2016-08-31 07:00:40
This seems to be the same conclusion I have come to. The other day I was talking with a friend and we were like "why don't we just run nodes with larger block sizes ourself?" then I realized that already exists, that is out there. It doesn't do anything if the miners don't switch. 
I don't really think there is any conspiracy though, not really anyway. I get why an individual miner wouldn't want to swtich. If a single one starts mining bigger blocks, maybe no one else does and his profits are lost, or may think that the transition period would be uncertain and bad for exchange rates. I think it makes sense for an individual miner to be conservative.
It does seem to be a problem though. the real power of consensus is not in the USERS or CONSUMERS of bitcoin, but the miners. That maybe was ok back when it was just a bunch of enthusiasts running on their PCs at home but since that isn't even remotely reasonable now seems we are just stuck at the miners decisions. Since it seems the majority of miners are not english speakers (at least not as a first language) all discussion about this on reddit seems pointless.

That would be fine if STORES accepted bitcoin. But they don't. Bitcoin may have great features but until I can buy things at a store or fuel station those features are moot. 
I love the idea of bitcoin. I have followed it for 5 years. The problem is it just doesn't have adoption for things I would ever use it for. Not only that large parts of the bitcoin community don't even think it should be. People say bitcoin makes for a poor payment network. They see bitcoin as digital gold not digital currency. That completely removes bitcoin as being useful for me.
I will continue to follow bitcoin. And will embrace it once I can buy fuel with it, like you suggested. But not only can I not now, it doesn't even seem to be a priority for he community, and some say it never should be.

In what way? How exactly does it help. Everyone keeps saying vague things like "it helps people with anonymity" well sure that's what tor does but why the hell does that matter for a bitcoin node. No one has said any actual details or given a situation where tor is needed or helpful.
What do you even mean partitioning of me? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:39:57
I don't get why the bitcoin community doesn't think this it the  issue with the currency. If it was the case that 90% of posts here were trying to solve THIS problem then I would be more optimistic. In fact the scary thing is many don't care about this issue or actively say bitcoin shouldn't be used as a payment network makes me totally not want to support the stuff.
I want a digital currency that is *more convenient than fiat*. Not: has niche use cases that are better than fiat. I want a digital currency that facilitates the  use case of money, buying goods and services (at least that is my  use.) If that isn't bitcoin fine, I will wait til something comes along that is does work like that.
Some people say there should be some other digital currency built off of bitcoin for payment networks. Fine if you want to support bitcoin make THAT thing happen, with high adoption, that should be the communities only goal IMO. If not then make bitcoin be able to do that.
I want bitcoin to succeed, but I will never invest in a currency that doesn't allow me to spend it conveniently.

Currently 20£ is far more than the amount of btc I have anymore. But good to know it's there as an option.
Though that doesn't make btc more convenient than £/$/€ but rather the same right? But maybe if it works exactly like a debt card with no catch or downside and just takes from btc it would satisfy my ideals enough to try it for small quantities.

I mean I still want it to be *more useful*. My wish is for bitcoin to become much much more useful than it is. It is currently not very useful to me. It isn't quite useless but it's not really very useful either.
It's not really a killer app that I want though. I just want to be able to use it for any of the things I NEED to spend money on in my life. Food, bills, rent, goods, services. Right now it is only limited to niche spending.

This is precisely why I don't expect the price if bitcoin to increase. The market equilibrium is NOT everyone using bitcoin. However if bitcoin doesn't have higher adoption, there is no reason the price should increase.
The problem is that "fewer transactions =&gt; smaller blocks" is true but running a node ALSO has a cost of storage, which is based upon time, not just the current rate of transactions.

I feel like if this is true bitcoin is doomed. There NEEDS to be criterion set in place that if XYZ conditions happen that we have to increase the blocksize. I am very pro segwit, I am very pro lightning, I am very pro all sorts of innovation that may mitigate the need to every increase it. I hope we never have to. but it can not be the case that the policy is not to have a plan in place where the network grows faster than innovation and we get stuck waiting for a new idea.
I imagine most people agree that blocksize would have to increase *someday* I am of the opinion it is not today, but I think it is a grave mistake to not have a concrete plan.

This has always bothered me, but is also the prevailing idea here on this subreddit. You can tell because of how happy people get when the exchange value goes up. People talking about HODL. I want bitcoin to replace fiat, I don't give a shit about how much one BTC is worth. Its infinitely divisible, it theoretically could become the dominant currency at any particular value. ( I get that can't happen in practice, but it still bothers me people use it as an investment.)

I understand bitcoin. I have for 6 years. I don't own any, so I won't be going to the moon either.
Because to own some requires having money you can invest. Being a student and now a poor academic means I live month to month paycheck. I never felt I could invest money into BTC.

It took me a few minutes and zero risk to upgrade my node. Miners have profit to risk if something goes wrong with their upgrade or even just some to lose in the minute or so of downtime the upgrade might take.
Upgrading my node, who cares if something goes wrong. If my node was down for a few hours, or days, or a month, so what. 
But for a miner, they need a REASON to upgrade.

From the [wiki page on Helium](
While I agree it is a waste of helium, it is a very small amount of helium. Any usage of helium where you need it in gas form is going to be small compared to the amounts needed for liquid applications.

Mostly what it takes is expedible income. Not everyone can afford to invest. It really bothers me that people think it just takes guts and commitment to hold bitcoin. And they expect that everyone should be happy they are making money from being early adopters.
Many people are massively in debt. Sure I could put aside a small amount of money to invest in BTC, but when I am gaining interest on tens of thousands of dollars of student debt, that it just doesn't make sense for me to do so. 
Please know that investing in anything, including bitcoin is a privlege of the well off and wealthy. If you think you *deserve* the money you make off supporting BTC, then you are really ignoring just how wealthy you are in the world. 
I have run a BTC node since 2011. but I am not an "early adopter" because I never had much spendable income, and often had to sell the btc I had just to make ends meet for unplanned financial issues have hit me. HODL is not something everyone is capable of doing. Don't think its just balls, its also being affluent.

I have not invested anything into bitcoin. I am interested in bitcoin because it solves a technical/social need in society.

They are? Tell me how I can use a payment channel. I don't need fancy lightning network, let me just open a payment channel between two bitcoin wallets. I have not found any way to do that. 
For example I would love to have a payment channel between my full node and a wallet on my phone. Or a payment channel between my wallet and an exchange. I don't think anything really supports this yet. I would love to be shown otherwise and how to do this.
@_date: 2017-02-08 04:11:54
Well that is incredibly generous of you. I will keep running my full node (running on the university network, couldn't pay for that myself. haha) I will remind you.
@_date: 2017-02-06 08:57:00
I prefer to store most of my BTC on my PC securely at home but I like to keep some on my phone in case I want to give a friend some BTC or I happen to find a merchant in the world who accepts BTC. However I don't want to keep too much on my phone so if a friend gives me some BTC or the prices goes up, I would transfer some back to my more secure account. If I spend some on my phone I need to send more to the phone. If I could do those transfers off chain most of the time, that would save me money on fees. If I needed the money to spend on my phone, I could close the channel, spend it. Having two accounts you own that you want to often slosh money back and forth, having a channel to do it keeps the fees down to just when you actually need it on the one end. The advantage is not huge, I agree, most of the time I will want to spend the money on the phone, close the channel, spend the full amount, whatever. but in the case that sometimes I need to send more back and forth to keep roughly ~$100 usd on my phone I can make those adjustments as the exchange rate changes without costing fees.
Example 2. I really only have 1 friend who uses BTC. If we grab drinks or food together one of us will pick up the tab and the other sends their share in BTC. Well we may alternate who pays, so one day I send him 0.01 and the next week he will send me 0.015 or something like that. If we just had a channel set up between us, we could do that exchange without costing us any fees, if either of us needed that for something else, either of us close the channel. Next time we meet, and have restocked our btc on our mobile wallets, set up another channel.
Example 3. Lets say I want to send some btc to an exchange, which I then want to get some fiat which I need to spend on something which only accepts fiat. then later I make some money in fiat and want to get it back into BTC. Well if my intial send to the exchange was a channel, I could have sent some, and at a later date send the btc back without two transfers. Hell if it was for the same amount I would have never had to touch the blockchain at all. If the exchange ACTUALLY needed that btc, it could close my channel and do whatever with it, but if it didn't actually need to directly use that BTC in the 3 months that I sent it, then when I received it back the  whole thing could be done with just 0 or 1 transfer instead of two, saving me or the exchange in fees.
I am not saying any of these are amazing, but they seem slightly nicer. There are some cases where a channel doesn't do anything, but I see it almost never hurting, so why not make that the DEFAULT idea instead of regular transactions. People who either want it now, or know they will never deal with that other party again could just close them instantly.
@_date: 2017-02-02 04:57:33
The attack would cost far more than the effect right? Your attack is based on the idea that fees are expensive, but the attack depends on you paying a bunch of fees yourself to send them the dust.

Look we all do things for our own benefit which may not make financial sense. Now that I know how much debt it out me in and how hard it's going to be to repay, yes I regret doing my PhD.
But at the moment. I can't speculate on a currency,which even if I think it had a good chance of being the future of the world, I can't take risks. Because I may be very very broke the rest of my life because of school.

I have been in massive debt since. I have cashed out all savings or any BTC I have bought a few times in the past 5 years just to make ends meet when something unexpected came up.

Question, why are we not using smart contract type transactions **now** for everything, even before the complicated bit of the network. I have asked this a few times and still can't get a solid answer.
Like if I want to send BTC to an exchange, why is that not done with one of these types of transactions, because it is probably somewhat likely that I will someday want to take BTC back off the exchange. If I change my mind immediately I can ask to have it sent back and nothing goes on chain. Or if later I convert some to some other currency then take half of what I sent initially back I just close the channel. If for some reason I want to close the channel immediately (or the exchange wants to) it seems very little downside to just have either party close ti when they need. So why is this not already the default for everything??
Sure it doesn't have all the fancy routing but I imagine most people already do many of the transactions back and forth between just a few entities. If we were doing this with payment channels it seems much easier for people to become familiar with them and understand how nice LN will be.
Maybe there is a reason not to do this already, but if these transactions are as convenient and lack downsides as people say why are we not already doing it. Is it just coming up with an accepted standard to implement on all wallets?
@_date: 2017-03-13 05:03:30
I guess that is true. But that means you just don't broadcast the transaction? I was thinking you make the transaction, broadcast it, and just make sure you include it yourself. If someone else wanted to take it great. In the case of including fees and just getting them back, I suppose that works just the same but requires not transmitting the transaction.

I wish the mentality of wanting to make money off bitcoin would go away completely.
HODLers talk about holding based on price, now how it will affect adoption.
We get far far more posts about "to the moon" when the price changes than any technical improvement or milestone of adoptions.
Most people, are *invested* in bitcoin, and they care about how much money they wil make. Bitcoin prices changing, even going up, if it is going up quickly all the time is still bad for adoption (long term.) you can't be a business and *price* things in bitcoin if the value will increase by 10% every 2 months.
We will never have the bitcoin accepting society until people stop caring about it as an investment and see it as a useful technology.
The investors are probably right, they will make money, but as long as that is the main sentiment around here, bitcoin is not ready for adoption.

The only way something like that would work internationally is something cryptographically secure, like bitcoin.

I am not sure why people use node counts for anything.
I could spin up 30 nodes in about an hour pretty easily if I wanted. I am sure people with more resources could spin up thousands. 
I think a big issue with bitcoin is there *is no reliable* way to poll what users want. Running nodes only tells you which tiny fraction of the population decided to run a node (or many nodes.) Mining only tells you what miners want. Nothing tells you what people who own or spend BTC want.
Because of this we kinda are stuck, and have to just go with what miners choose. They are the real people putting resources into securing the network. They are the only ones with the power to change things. We will all have to follow (or have just our nodes reject) whatever blocks they produce. Like it or not.
@_date: 2017-03-15 05:36:40
Is this even true? There are lots of nodes out there that are not running core nor BU. None with a particularly large percentage but they are there.
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:25:54


How? I am in favor of Segwit, I run a 0.14.0 node. But without mining nothing I can do. However I am probably also a "big blocker" in the eyes of some people where because I think we should also go to 2 or 8MB blocks asap. Or at least have a concrete set of requirements set *now* for when we would jump to 2 or more in size.
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:31:27
Why not both? I want segwit, and right now I think the best way to do it would be to get some of the bigblockers to join. The way to do that is throw them a bone and set real conditions for when the blocksize would increase. I mean it has to increase someday right? Why not be more explicit.
@_date: 2017-03-13 04:18:33
Yes there is opportunity cost when blocks are full. Sure. Good to know they actually do this strategy, and do send the payouts with 0 fees. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:41:23
I don't want power. Just that other people try to claim that running nodes gives people power to have a say in anything. It doesn't.

This is the most sane thing I have read on here. I feel too many people are using bitcoin as an *investment* and just care about the price/value.

Talking to us is useless. The only people who matter for this issues is the miners.
@_date: 2017-03-13 03:53:03
I ran the node with 
    -mintxfee=0.00000001 -minrelaytxfee=0.00000001
so that it would continue to relay the transaction that low. I also performed the transaction FROM the code node. So I believe it continued to resend the transaction relaying it to other nodes. I am not 100% sure of that.
Waiting three months was a long time though, I had pretty much given up on it ever being included. Not sure how those zero fee ones ever do.
If I was a miner and had to send a transaction, I would put zero fees on it. Maybe thats what those are.
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:30:16
I know core has a list of scaling ideas, I still feel the solution is to be more concrte with them. Don't leave them as ideas, put real rules down for "after segwit then X Y and Z happen we will go to blocksize A".
It would shut up the bigblockers and get progress to happen. sure some of the BU people are crazy, but I imagine most of them are just worried that core will never scale again after segwit. Throw those people a bone and we can move on.
Full disclosure. I am not pro BU, but I myself would feel more comfortable as well if core implemented something concrete of when the block size would increase.
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:09:49
I run a full node. Its running 14.0. I am doing my part. Don't be mad at me. I just have been running this node for 5 years and never felt like I had any power to change anything.
@_date: 2017-03-10 05:16:01
I have run a node for 5 years and I don't feel I have any say at all. Hell at one point I was like "Screw this why can't I just hard fork to have bitcoin do what I want" until realizing I could change my client to do whatever I wanted but it doesn't matter AT ALL if no one mines a block for that.
A node gives you zero power.  Only mining matters. I could do absolutely anything on my node and it would make now difference. Unless for some reason miners were not allowed to also run their own nodes, but whatever I miner wanted to do, they could just run a node for their own thing and it would be fine. No support or rejection of them I do matters.
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:50:29
Because calling them an enemy is a sure fire way to have them continue to never start mining segwit blocks. Which we need.
I am not saying do 8mb blocks now, but you have to admit that we will need to increase blocksize SOMEDAY under certain conditions. I see no harm with being firm about when we would do that. Even if those conditions are never met because offchain stuff (or other innovations) scales so well  we never reach that point. I still think something should be in place for if that happens. Even with segwit, if we wanted bitcoin to reach Visa level numbers of transactions we can't do it with the current blocksize.
I understand what you are saying that it is unnecessary now, since segwit will probably solve all the current short term problems, but I see no reason why we can't have a concrete plan for scaling after, now, rather than waiting until after to figure out what step 2 is.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:15:34
I run a 0.14.0 node, but I don't consider this act to be "voicing" for anything. Node counts don't matter. They should not be considered *votes* because nothing is stopping me from running 10 more.

I sent one a while back from my main btc node to my phone at 	0.004 sat/B. Just wanted to see if it ever would confirm. It did after 3 months. I think I had to set my node to continue to relay it though as most would drop it from the mempool I imagine.
@_date: 2017-03-06 06:06:49
I guess I wish it was implemented before "top to bottom" get parts of it live and running. I would use a payment channel between just two parties for EVERY btc transaction I do if it was an option. I guess I will just have to wait.

My node updated, not because I went out of my way to upgrade, just because my linux distribution put out the update for 0.13 then 0.13.1 and then 0.13.2. I like to keep all software up to date because things may have security flaws (meaning other software not bitcoin.)
I imagine many node administrators are like me and updated because it was an automatic update, not because they were trying to indicate anything politically.
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:21:36
Currently there is NO method for which segwit will activate even if 99% of nodes were ready and doing everything they could for segwit. You can't propagate a non segwit block.
At best, what nodes do is tell miners roughly what the rest of the network wants. Right now there is nothing else anyone can do. If no one ever produces a segwit block, then what nodes do mean jack shit.
@_date: 2017-03-11 05:40:05
But who cares what I reject. Why should anyone else ever care what my node accepts or rejects. If you were a miner and wanted to have nodes accept things, you would just also run a node with your miner. 
Yes you need other people to USE the blockchain that you are mining on for it to be useful, but you don't need anyone to run nodes for your chain, you can always run your own nodes. If 3000 people ran nodes of your choosing but no one actualy bought or spent coins on it, its pointless. The running of nodes accepting your blocks isn't what matters. Just that you mine block that people are going to do stuff with. Yes it is more likely to have people use the blocks that more people run nodes for, but there isn't any power in the nodes. All it does is signal "I am one person who would use blocks mined that are accepted by this node."
Just saying that on reddit has the same power as running the node.
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:19:41
I am not saying its a good thing. I was trying to say the problem is that we have no way of measuring anything about developers, speakers merchants. I was trying to say that the fact that the only control being in miners is a bad thing. 
The nature of bitcoin makes it impossible to measure just about any other metric. I was not trying to minimize those contributions, just that we have no way to directly measure them. So they are sadly over looked.
@_date: 2017-03-14 06:24:51


I have never had enough that I could risk that. Even when I started and bitcoin was $10=1BTC. I was a starving PhD student with massive debt. 
I hope people who hold bitcoin stay aware of the fact that you have that not because you were early to the party, but that you also very importantly had enough money to risk on investments.
I have no investments, because I still have massive debt. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:19:24
If you really want to make segwit happen, I feel you should try to learn Chinese. 
Also running a node doesn't matter for segwit to happen. If 98% of nodes were segwit ready nothing would happen.
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:18:31
I think this is in part because it is so complex and nuanced how can any one ever make a decision. If someone wants a decision to be made they have to try to convince people, and you can't convince people if it seems complex because then it is too complex to ever be sure what the right choice is.
@_date: 2016-06-30 07:09:06


This is exactly my position, which is why I don't value bitcoin. I want it to get there, I want to have bitcoin become more useful. Not everyone seems to have that as the goal though. Many seem to be fine as treating it as an investment, or to get around regulations or tax laws or whatever.
I want a decentralized, digital currency, that I can SPEND. Maybe bitcoin won't be that, but it makes me sad that it isn't, and sadder that most people don't care if it goes that way or not.
@_date: 2017-01-25 03:13:50
The way to do progress IMO, is to have core release a set of checks that need to be reached such that they WOULD increase blocks size. Make one of those checks be segwit. 
Right now the bigblockers believe core is a conspiracy to never ever increase blocksize after segwit. so they reject everything core says. This can be solved by just having core say when they *would* increase blocksize, in a very concrete manner.
I want segwit, but I also want much much clearer route forward after it. Many people don't want to commit to when they would increase block size hoping for more invoation which wont need it, or  want to see what things actaully look like after segwit. That is fine, but you *also* have to have a clear map of what happens if even after segwit after N time the blocks still end up being full. You don't get to wait and hope we can implement an new idea in time, it needs to be "if blocks are full and this criterion is met we increase blocks" and if you can innovate a solution (off chain stuff maybe) BEFORE it reaches that, great, but have a concrete plan to increase blocks in case you don't.
@_date: 2016-06-24 02:07:45
I wish people didn't view bitcoin as a way to make money. I get that is what most people are interested in it for, but I like it because I want it to be USEFUL. I think the tech is cool and want to do stuff with it, not find a way to get rich off it.
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:09:28
Personally, I don't think it is developers that need to do much to change things. It is just addoption in my opinion. I don't think bitcoin needs a kill app, just needs to be accepted most places that I buy stuff.

Am I the only one who feels morally awkward about bitcoin as an investment. One of my rejections of the banking system as is, is that investment rewards those who are already wealthy. The whole idea of "it takes money to make money" is what bothers me. People using bitcoin as an investment, hoping to get rich off it because they have money to invest in BTC now, and expect that means that later they will have money to go to the moon kinda bothers me.
The value will go up with mass adoption, but there is no reason we need that. It is infinitely divisible, we can't run out, so the value of any individual BTC is arbitrary. We are fully capable of having an economy where 1btc is the equivalent of $10,000 today or 1btc is equivalent to $0.1. However because of the way economics actually works, early investors are going to be rich of this idea. I think maybe at the heart I care more about equality than individual rights, which is kinda against the philosophy of bitcoin. 
I care far more about stability of value than the value of BTC going up. I want a digital currency which is convenient, not one that will make investors rich. I get that's not how things work, but just how my ideals work. BTC has to continue to raise in value to keep mining profitable. I think this is the personal issue for me which causes me to not fully jump on board.
@_date: 2016-06-24 05:13:32
Sure, but that is not developers fault. It's just adoption rate. I don't think adoption rate will increase by having better software. The software is good enough at this point, just no one uses it.
@_date: 2017-01-17 02:36:19
I think the best strategy would be for core to just announce a fixed set of criterion in which they would support a blocksize increase. Obviously it will have to increase someday, if they think that isn't today, come up with a set of things needed that they would support it. Then people could do segwit and know that core won't oppose further increases forever. 
Both sides seem to focus on the irrational side of the other. Some think core is going to do segwit and then *never* increase ever again. The other side seem to think big blockers want 10000gb blocks and can't compromise.
Most people who are pro segwit also say they would want a further block increase eventually. Just get coredev to say concretely when they *would* increase the blocksize after segwit and I think we can convert enough.
@_date: 2016-06-24 02:26:30
I think because it distracts from the tech. It hurts adoption. It is seen as a thing to speculate on, or a get rich quick scheme from people who don't buy into it. That isn't going to give confidence to people to adopt it and embrace it. If people stopped worrying about getting rich and focused on making it useful maybe there would be more progress in that area, though of course that is just my opinion.
I think many people (including myself) see the fact that "if we make bitcoin useful, the price will go up and a bunch of speculators will get rich" as a negative for wanting to increase adoption. One of the aspects I dislike about current global monetary policy is the idea that "it takes money to make money." Bitcoin doesn't have that built in, but it does if everyone hoards the stuff hoping to get rich off of it rather than advocating buying stuff with bitcoin.

This is actually something that kind of bothers me about the community. I obviously don't want to ruin bitcoin or anything, but it seems like most people are *invested* in it financially. So everyone is going to be ultra conservative and care mostly about making sure it retains value, stronger than the push to make it more *useful*.
I wish it wasn't seen as such an investment platform, because what I want is the ability to use it everywhere, and personally don't care about the price. I feel like most of the community have the reverse goals. I get that both are related, being more useful would obviously make it more valuable, but it does bother me a bit that people care about price.
Bitcoin, theoretically, could become massively adopted at **any** exchange rate. We can divide it as much as we want, so if it dropped to $1 a bitcoin in value, we could still have everyone adopt it and eliminate fiat. It could be 1btc = $0.01 worth of "value" and still be the global currency. the price is so arbitrary. I wish we could just focus on getting the stuff to be a global currency and not worry about how much a single coin is worth. I know it doesn't work like this, the whole ecosystem of mining needing to be profitable and such, it just feels like its all backwards sometimes.

I guess, but you can notice many responses in this thread are simply saying things like bitcoin is not good at being a payment network and they seem to accept that like it's fine that way. From reading the top few responses it sounds like many people have no interest in making bitcoin work as a payment network or have given up on it. It's fine if speculation is part of the process but it just can be all there is, at least to me.
I am not interested in investing. That's not what makes me excited about bitcoin. It's fine that others use it for that but if the majority are satisfied with it stay nothing more than a decentralized way to store their money as a safeguard, bitcoin won't become what I hope it will.

The same sort of payment channels that LN uses, but forget all the fancy networking to find another member who already has an open channel.
In LN if I want to make a payment to you, it would go through my existing payment channels and tries to find someone I have a channel open with who has one with you and forward the payment through that network. That is the magic part of LN, but it is also the complex bit.
If we take the same sort of payment channels from LN with all the same signing and such, tie up N amount of btc between just you and me and let us alter that with signatures but only care about you and me and not the rest of the network, that is what I am calling a dumb payment channel.
It is still instant, since its the same idea as LN, its a contract that either of us could close and put onto the blockchain by signing our side of it to close the channel. However you don't need all that fancy networking and adoption. I personally feel like we should be doing this for all payments as soon as we can, and worry about the network part after this has adoption. Like right now if I want to send btc to an exchange, why not do that with a payment channel, because I may want to send more later, or take some back, and can do all that off chain. even without full lightning.
I may be missing something big, but I don't see a downside to everyone doing LN like payment channels for basically all transactions, if you want it on chain, then close the channel right after, if not great keep it off chain til you want to close it. Sure lightning is great for an actual payment network, but I don't see a downside to single one-to-one payment channels before that since already and btc transaction is essentially like that.
@_date: 2017-01-12 08:28:01
Ya sure, but the routing part is the complex bit. I mean sure the channels have their own complexity with how the signatures all work but that isn't the hard to implement part. All I am saying is I see a huge benefit to rolling out and adopting LN without the network and after we have that accepted to try to get the routing bit figured out. It doesn't seem to be the directions these sort of implementations are taking though.
This particular implementation has tons of complexity in the routing, trying to ensure privacy, onion routing, etc. It requires segwit as well which means I can't even use its payment channels on the main network yet.
I am very happy for LN when it comes, I just think that there are things we could implement NOW, which get us part way to lightning networks that I think we should do. Lets forget the complexity of the routing and get LN-like payment channels working now.
I don't really want my phone doing onion routing and complex network activity, but I would like it to be able to support ANY kind of payment channel.

Just as a test, 2 months ago I sent small amount of btc with a VERY small fee, just to see if it would ever get confirmed. Blockchain.info wouldn't even track my transaction saying the fee was too low and their client rejected it.
I was very surprised it was confirmed after 2 months. I made the transaction from a full node which kept broadcasting it even though the fee was low. 
So who knows, anything can be accepted eventually.
I do think we need to figure out how to make this kind of issue much more clear for users though, otherwise it is hard for me to recommend my less tech savy friends to try btc.
@_date: 2017-01-12 13:35:47
Ya, sure. I get that. I guess I am fine with it locking up my btc in many cases. When exchanging with anyone that I expect a reasonable probability I will exchange with them again in the future. I get that locking up your money is bad for a payment network, but since already transfers take ~30 mins I am not sure it is that bad. I would personally be fine with it in most cases.
@_date: 2016-11-04 04:01:56
Interesting. I didn't realize the log would show the time they were broadcast, assumed would always show time of confirmation. I will look into it. 
Any idea why the backup would have 2 transactions that the current wallet does not?
@_date: 2017-01-10 14:01:03
I would be happy if anything with other layers were there. I still cant get my head around why there is no standard way to do a payment channel, not lightening, just a dumb payment channel with me and one other party. Maybe let me go back and forth with an exchange or a friend with payment channels rather than direct transactions before I will believe it will work.
I guess also I have different hopes than others. I do want a cryptographically secure, decentralised paypal. That was what I imagined in 2011 when I first got into this stuff. Everyone seems to want something else now.

Sure it has to have value, but its arbitrary if its 1btc = $1000 or 1000btc = $1. 
The amount of value is arbitrary, as long as it isn't worthless. The value only has to be above a certain amount because of mining which needs to be profitable.

I have been trying to say something like this for a month now. I think this was the time I came out phrased the best.
There are extreme views on either side, but I don't think they are the minority. Those who oppose segwit seem to believe that there is some conspiracy that core will never increase blocksize after segwit. I sure hope they are wrong, but it seems like an easy fix for core and those that support it.
I am very pro segwit, but it seems odd that people don't have a roadmap for further scaling after it. Even if you want to say segwit will solve all the problems now... it won't solve it forever. I don't see the harm of coming up with a longer term plan, making it public, especially since the other sides criticism is they think core will never ever increase.

I have been following bitcoin since 2011. I cashed out when it was over $1000/btc. I still really am fascinated with cryptocurrency and follow the msth and technical invocations of bitcoin. I don't really have a need of digital store of value though, personally. I wish bitcoin could find a way to be p2p cash but it is pretty clear people have given up on tbat. Maybe they are right to. Though I am very excited lightning though it's a bit far off. I will use bitcoin as much as I can once it has some solution (maybe LN) for working as a payment system..
You don't have to be financially invested in bitcoin to follow the development and be interested. I want a cryptocurrency to replace all other forms of payment. I once hoped it would be bitcoin. I have not quite given up that it still could be someday. But Everytime someone says that bitcoin is poorly suited to replace visa it makes me sad for the currency.

I am poor and don't own anything really so that won't ever be an option for me.

I'm not sure what you mean by political pressure. EVERY change will have politics of some kind. What am I missing. Why do you suspect political pressure will ever go away.
It is good to hear that people want a blocksize increase after segwit. I think more discussion of that or even a roadmap or timetable or criterion for when that will happen after segwit would calm a large part of the community.
At the moment people talk more about how bigger blocks will lead to problems rather than a real discussion of how it will come about after segwit.

This seems to be in line with that I think at the moment. I am happy about segwit, just it can't be the end of the story! Lets get segwit going, but why the hell do we have to wait for segwit to get adopted to discuss seriously what the plan for scaling is after segwit.

I personally would love if people would start using dumb payment channels everywhere, before we start trying to do lightning. I would love to hear an argument for why this isn't a good idea.
I think if we did all our dealings with exchanges, or online shops, or whatever with single payment channels it would be a good test to see if we can get people to actually use lightning. I think most people probably do many transactions with any exchange they might use. I would love for this to be the default.
I am going to go ahead and run this daemon on my server. I currently have no other software that can support the payment channels though. I would love to test this kind of stuff with a small amount of coins on my phone or something but I am not sure there is any payment channel supporting BTC software for android.

I am quite confused, how does this prevent any other entity form charging its own interest rate for whatever they want. This is just the rate one entity charges, its the price they set for borrowing money when it comes to federal money.

I understand that there can't be a concrete roadmap, but there also isn't even discussion among the people who support core about what the plan is. Its fine if it is not decided yet but mostly I see "we can't increase block size because it will lead to too much centralization" 
Well ok, if that's what people think we are fucked, unless we come up with a better idea. Maybe just some discussion for what criterion would have to be met before core supporters WOULD be in favor of an increased block size. Obviously if the network keeps growing it will have to increase at some point, if we are not at that point yet, fine but what is that point? When will people be comfortable increasing it?
Im fine if people say we can't increase it now, but if the answer is "we should never increase it" then it makes me feel like bitcoin is doomed. I just want people admitting that something will need to be done after segwit, and what ideas are for how to measure when we need to do it.

I am all for segwit, but would be WAY more comfortable if a solid plan for how scaling will happen **after** segwit. I think many people are frustrated that segwit feels like it is being pushed as a solution, rather than a first step. 
Don't kill discussion for increasing blocksize just because you have step one done. Lets start planning for step 2 afterwards. The fact that core has given no roadmap or even what their ideas for steps to be done after segwit is what is causing me (and therefor I assume others) to worry.

I guess I am not sure how segwit helps the quadratic validation probalem. 
I am well aware there are issues with increasing block weight but I am not sure what people are suggesting beyond segwit. 
If segwit helps with quadratic validation or other issues with blocks weight increase then are people if favor of increasing the block size after segwit takes off? 
If not then what IS the proposal to increase scale after segwit. Because it is clear many people don't see segwit as being enough. Telling "just wait til after segwit " isn't sufficient.

Bitcoin has a built in way to prevent that. Have them send you a signed message which can then prove they own that address. I only know how to do that with the full client but you can 100% prove they own the address.

The things I like about bitcoin are: 
first and foremost that it is digital so it *SHOULD* be the easiest and most convenient way to pay for things online. That was my hope when I first got interested about **5 years ago**. Imagining buying stuff on amazon more simply, sending money to friends, buying items in video games, etc. All done with a mathematically safe currency. I took graduate level math courses in cryptography so that part was cool to me. Sadly it still isn't the easiest thing for any of those uses.
Reason 1b is that if currency is digital then I should be able to pay my rent online. Buy my beer by tapping an IC card. Let my friend borrow money by scanning a QR code. Some of this is possible but it isn't convenient until mass adoptions.
Reason 2 is that it is decentralized. To me the biggest benefit here is that I would be able to use it in a whole bunch of countries but the idea itself is good to. Remove banks and governments. My problem with banks is that they operate under "it takes money to make money" which people HODL seem to be happy with themselves so not sure why they hate banks.
MY problem is then when bitcoin is used as an investment, people don't seem to try to further the goals that I had for the currency. People don't even want to call it a currency anymore. They want to compare it to digital gold or just a place to store value. Who cares. I want sci-fi credits. Thats the future that excites me. Not making money because I heard about bitcoin 5 years before it became big.
If people invest in bitcoins that means they are not spending them, meaning the focus moves away from making ti spendable! If you just want the price to go up, then ya you have goals other than being able to pay rent and buy a beer with it. It doesn't need to support micro-transactions or be convenient to use if you don't want to spend it in the first place!
Next is that 5 year ago, I was a poor graduate student, I didn't have money to invest in bitcoins, but other people then did, and they expect to be rewarded for investing. Why? I have run a full node for years yet have no personal interest in the price going up. If we reward investors to me it is no better than banks, why not just have their money go up for getting into banking early. Its not exactly the same but seems pretty similar.
For bitcoin to accomplish my goals it can do it at **ANY** exchange rate to fiat. If everyone switched to BTC when 1BTC = $1 or $100 or $1000 it makes no difference to me. The most important thing in my mind is that such an exchange is *stable* while society switches from fiat to btc. I guess I don't care after everyone uses it, but in the middle period, like now, prices going up, or down, are bad in my mind. So when most people have the goal of using it as an investment their goals seem misaligned with mine!
I guess the last reason is sort of selfish and personal but that I don't have anything to invest. I don't have a need for investments, because that requires having value. So if people claim the  use for btc is to store value then it is *useless* for me. I like bitcoin, I want it to be useful but I don't have capital, I am an academic and live paycheck to paycheck.
I will keep running my full node, but I have less than 0.04 BTC to my name. I sold off the 2.0BTC I owned when they were ~$1000/BTC to make ends meet back then. I will do everything I can to support bitcoin, short of store value in it. Because that is contrary to my goals, and something I am not even capable of.
I would love to hear your response, or why you think people investing does help accomplish my goals. Why you think people making money off of it is somehow good.

My problem with this is its essentially admitting "bitcoin still is a failure at its main purpose" it makes me thing the value of the stuff should never have increased at all until something like LN is implemented.
If we admit bitcoin can't be "electronic cash system" as is, well then we better get that lightining up asap and stop pretending it is worth a damn now.

Japan sadly is not the futuristic society people imagine. Not at all.
There are some things which seem increasingly modern and slightly ahead of its time, and others which seem stuck 40 years ago.
Living here I feel like japan is a futuristic society something in the late 1970s or early 1980s would have imagined what 2016 would be like. Fax machine in **every** home! 
Banking in japan makes little sense. Everything is cash only, but ATMs close when the bank closes. People tend to carry hundreds or thousands of dollars (equivalent) on them since getting cash is inconvenient but required. Online banking is only starting to become a thing and is still pretty poorly done. Someone should tell them the whole point of an ATM is to have it be open when the bank is closed!

Genuine question, why are people not using payment channels for stuff now, without all the fancy networking of lightning. I get that the networking part is the sexy bit for some people, but I find myself doing most of my bitcoin transactions with a very small number of parties ( a friend, an exchange, the one bar in tokyo that accepts btc) and often repeated transactions. Seems easier if I used payment channels.
Any way I can get that going before full lightning becomes a thing?
@_date: 2016-12-20 02:19:00
I have a question that I would like to have answered. What is the barrier for having payment channels now? Not the fancy networked ones from lightning, but just a dumb payment channel, I open with one other party and at any time either of us can close it. I would love that now, and I feel like people doing that first, before lightning would get people used to the idea of pay ment channels.
It seems like getting people to adopt this, at least in part, should be the number one goal to eventual lightning adoption. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2016-12-15 06:54:02
You are right. Its just that I don't need to send 1,000,000 to Paraguay, and probably never will. If bitcoin isn't the digital currency for the things I want then I am happy to find one that is. Its just that bitcoin has the network effect and going to draw the smartest talent to work on it.
For 5 years now, I have wanted a cryptocurrency that I can pay my rent with, and buy groceries, send to friends, pay for digial goods/services, etc. Some alt coins have looked ok but never last long enough for me to decide if they really are a good idea or not.
My only hope left is either lightining gets here, and fast, so bitcoin can finally do the things I want. Or bitcoin completely fails and collapses and we can get the best minds working one something that will be useful for me.
Hell I would be happy if we just had simple payment channels, without a network, I am fine paying for my coffee over 30 transactions with an open payment channel that either of us can close any time to keep it off chain if we want, but that isn't even here yet. And thats the easy part of the LN (the network part is the hard bit.)
Its fine to tell me that what I want simply can't exist. We won't have crypto decentralized cash. If so then fine I will probably stop following bitcoin and shutdown my full node if someone convinced me it was impossible.
@_date: 2016-12-09 06:54:18
That has nothing to do with my point. Even if lightning never takes off, I want to use payment channels now. How can I set that up?
@_date: 2016-11-22 08:09:27
I think this is the crux of the issue. Some people are worried there will always be something on the horizon which postpones scaling. "Oh just wait for schnoor, oh now just wait for lightning" etc. Maybe it does "buy us enough time" but not everyone is in agreement of where that cutoff is. Nor should there be absolute agreement. What is "enough" in this sense.
However some sort of agreement of what criterion we WOULD increase would be nice. Like we can hope that we get Schnoor signatures before needed but lets actually nail down what "needed" is. I want to say yes lets try to get Schnorr signatures before increasing block size, but only if we have in place a plan for what metrics to use that people can agree to increase it. How close to capacity before we increase block size, maybe Schnoor makes it in time maybe it doesn't but lets just come up with a damn metric to measure this by and end most of the arguments. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 08:05:31
I guess I see both sides as just as much "political" pressure. Some are putting pressure to increase block size and some are putting pressure to keep it as is. It's not really different. 
I think the political nature of bitcoin is one of the strengths. It's all based on voting and consensus. It seems foolish then to not try to discuss something in the face of political pressure. I see that as the whole point. If parts of the community want something we should be doing everything we possibly can to address the issues.
If the honest answer is that blocksize should be increased after segwit then let's really really try to get people to talk about how and when we will do that. if the honest answer is that it won't be increased then we need to engage with the minority and not shut then out about why it won't happen.
What bothers me is the lack of discussion. Clearly some people want better on chain scaling, beyond the increase from segwit. I think they have some points and want to know what that future change is. I think saying it won't be addressed until the minority is silent is exactly the wrong answer and why people are upset.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:13:03
Thats not **re**distribution. Redistribution is when you take money and give it to people who don't already have it. What you are talking about is just *distribution*. 
The examples you gave were not examples of redistribution.
@_date: 2016-12-09 05:32:09
I think if core just announced "This is how and when we will raise block size" and have some metric for what conditions must be met (segwit, x amount of transactions per day, x amount of whatever other scaling metric) and how they would do it in that case and it would totally shut up 90% of the complainers.
Yes there are some crazies out there who will stay antisegwit and blocksize or bust, but most are not that extreme and some clear roadmap for when it would be raised would do the community a LOT of good imo.
@_date: 2016-12-09 08:40:06
Hmm ok. But something we could possibly put into a bitcoin ATM. Then we just get on the same network when there next to it, open a payment channel from a few exchanges and having used a QR code or two to check the addresses being exchanged were correct. 
Hmm, the software protocol will have to be some sort of standard to do that from some mobile device with an ATM. Anyway I now feel like something like this NEEDS to happen long before we work on lightning. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 05:55:42
I am very pro segwit but it really bothers me how the core community dismisses the concerns of thee BU and other big blockers. I get that some of them do come off as crazy but many have legit concerns.
I think the easiest solution is just to promise (and by that I mean come up with a very clear set of conditions) to crease the blocksize after segwit. Most pro-segwit people seem to think that of course eventually the blocksize will need to be increased. Why not just embrace that, write down a solid plan for "when these factors are met (segit, X usage, Y whatever) we will increase blocksize" put that into 13.2 while waiting for segwit to finish, and incorporate that community rather than split it.
@_date: 2016-11-02 05:49:11


Ew. I guess this is my problem. I read stuff like that and completely turned off.
I *don't* want bitcoin to be a good investment. I want it to be a useful currency.  More and more I see my hopes for bitcoin to be vastly different than many in the community. 
I see people getting rich off investing in bitcoin as the single largest reason to detract from it. Maybe it just isn't for me. I will keep running my node, and hoping for lightning or the ability to scale so I can use the damn technology, but I don't give a damn about investments.
@_date: 2016-11-07 14:28:11
Not if you just hold it and never spend it. adoption requires people *using* bitcoin for stuff. Someone holding their bitcoin in a cold storage wallet is identical to the ~5 BTC I lost on an old harddrive from 2011. That doesn't help adoption.
@_date: 2017-01-26 06:06:02




To me this is the biggest issue. I feel like the segwit supporters could really convert the otherside with a *concrete* set of conditions that blocksize would be increased post segwit. Maybe those conditions are never met, and segwit is all that is required, but people who want bigger blocks now, are going to always worry until a solid roadmap for bigger blocks later is setup.
@_date: 2016-12-15 06:17:58
I suppose. I guess I am just still sad bitcoin hasn't become what I originally was promised and envisioned. I personally have no need for a digital long term store of value. I was excited in 2011 about being able to buy things by tapping my phone, send money to friends digitally, buy digital goods, pay for things in many countries, all with magic internet money.
Bitcoin has failed me, and my purposes. I guess you are right that it is up to the community to make it work, I just no longer believe the community has similar goals to me. Anyone who settles for it being an investment or long term store of value breaks my heart. But I guess the fact that it has the seemingly high value when it fails at the things I want it for means my opinion doesn't match everyone else.

Sure the credit card fee is higher, but me giving money to my friend with other digital cash services it isn't. Digital cash needs to be compared to buying my coffee or splitting my bill with CASH.

I get there have to be tech improvements, but it also can't just always stay the same block size. BOTH are needed. Even a 2mb plan for after segwit would drastically improve the chances of it being accepted by those who resist it, I imagine. I know there are some crazies out there but many who resist segwit (foolish IMO) are scared that it will mean never increasing the block size. People will always just say "no just wait for the next tech improvement" and never actually let it happen. I can kinda see that side of the  argument myself.
I want segwit, and schnorr signatures, and a ton of other tech improvements, but I also think it is REALLY BAD to just not ever increase the block size. I think the problem we have no is that blocksize increase needed to happen before we got to this situation. If segwit wasn't already implemented I would be pro 2mb now, but instead I am pro 2mb very shortly after segwit. We will have to see how much scaling is needed after segwit but things are *not* ok now. My guess is that post segwit it will only be a few months before we will needed someway to scale. Other tech improvements won't get there in time.
I personally was in favor of the segwit+2mb all at once but that seems to not be something people consider anymore. The blocks WILL need to increase, someday. Some tech improvements here and there may help but ultimately if we want bitcoin to have massive adoption it isn't going to be able to stay at (the arbitrary) 1mb forever. Thats even if we have things like lightning. I would love lightning to be ready now, but even if it were I would still be pro 2mb now.
You are right some people in the community want to cast aside the tech improvments and want nothing more than big blocks, and that sucks. Just as bad though is people who think we are going to be able to get away with always finding some way to scale without increasing block size and there is no way that is always going to work.
I agree that the criteria is subtle, hard to measure, etc, I think the biggest tech improvement bitcoin could add next is a really smart way of figuring out when and how to measure the need and how to implement block size increases. Whenever they may be needed.
@_date: 2016-11-02 08:27:24
I think the confusion of this poster actually shows a problem with adoption. When we talk about price and say "1btc is not worth over $700" it is not hard for layperson to think "oh I can't afford one" but even worse "how useless if you have to spend $700 at a time" !!!
Now I am sure it is easy to dispell this confusion by talking about fractional bitcoins, but I think it does show a hurdle to adoption. People who have *never* heard of bitcoin may think these things and dismiss it from the start! 
I know there were movements to use "satoshi" or "mBTC" which the confusion of OP makes me feel we need to revisit!

High fees have prevented me from convincing others to use bitcoin. I used to convince friends to let me pay my share of a split meal by sending them it in bitcoin, but why do that when something like square cash or google wallet or whatever, has no fee for them and the same thing in bitcoin costs them $0.20?
Every time that happens that makes one less potential user of bitcoin.

This always seems to boil down to strawman arguments. Just because there are a few people who seem crazy who are vocal about block size doesn't mean everyone who wants a different max block size is crazy.
I am in favor of increasing the max block size. At least I want to still *debate* it. Saying "there was never a debate" just shuts down discussion. This is something many people are still wanting, and even if you disagree with a few radicals out there doesn't mean the entire idea should be dismissed.
There very much still needs to be a debate because not everyone is in agreement about this.

I think doing so (meaning actually implementing this type of fork) would actually calm a *ton* of the people worried the other side is never going to increase, and those worried about the increase have 2 years to figure out something better otherwise it goes up to 2mb.

@_date: 2016-11-21 08:40:19
Then please enlighten me. What is the proposed criterion for after segwit that people will try to implement a blocksize increase. Even if you think we won't need it for a while after segwit, there should be some metrics in which core will support a blocksize increase eventually. What are those things? How full do the blocks need to be, how large must the network be, before 2mb will be proposed. How will it be proposed? The hong kong agreement was rejected so now I have no idea what the plan for 2mb is. I understand it should be sometime after segwit but if I am so wrong then what is the plan? 
If you are tired of people "spewing" these questions, then why don't we just sticky something about the proposed scaling changes after segwit? 
People are scared that there are not real scaling plans after segwit, at least nothing serious. I would be very happy to be shown I am wrong. It seems like people are quite uncertain or conflicted about the plan for after segwit. Some answer would just be "lightning networks" others say that after segwit we could do larger blockweights, but I don't see anyone plan for how or when that is taken seriously.
@_date: 2016-12-09 08:13:51
Hmm, Ya this is something I would really like to have working. Maybe I will look into developing it myself. This is the first time I have noticed a feature of bitcoin ecosystem that I wanted, and was feasible and not sure why it wasn't there.
Seems like this would be a great precursor to lightning. If people were already in the habit of setting up payment channels with just a single other person it would be easy to transition to a more sophisticated network. Seems like people who commonly put stuff into and take out of exchanges would all like this. Or just any two friends who exchange money back and forth occasionally.
So what would be needed other than just a bitcoin address. Am I correct in thinking I would need their address, create the contract for my address and theirs, send it to them, have them sign it appropriately, send it back to me? Am I missing a step?
@_date: 2016-12-20 07:20:32
I am interested in the idea and technology of bitcoin. I am not interested in *investments*. I think one of the biggest negatives I have about bitcoin is the community seems to focus on its price and using it as an investment platform rather than focusing on making it useful and spending the damn stuff. 
I have studied quite a bit of cryptography, and really enjoy the math behind it. I would love if currency was cryptographically secure. I guess I am interested in bitcoin from an academic standpoint. Also as a (young) academic I don't really have any spare cash laying around to invest.
It makes me sad that I have followed bitcoin for 5 years now, and it still hasn't become something useful for me. I can't buy stuff with bitcoin. Why would I want to own any significant amount? It also makes me sad that people think they should be rewarded just for being early adopters. If the exchange rate NEVER changed, ever, lets say it never goes up, it is still totally possible it had 100% adoption and became our global currency. Because it is infinitely divisible I see the exchange rate as totally arbitrary. I am not sure why others don't. So I think it SHOULDNT be used as an investment, so I don't.
I want magic internet money. I dont want tech geeks like me to get rich, I just want to be able to buy stuff with digital money like we live in a futuristic fantasy. 
I will keep following bitcoin, for the tech news. I will continue to ignore the price and exchange rate. I hope changes are made to make bitcoin more *useful* and wish people didn't worry what those changes would do the the *value*.  I don't believe that is possible if you are invested in it.

I really don't see how that will ever be cost effective vs a space heater. A single ASIC card gives what $10 per day? So it takes a year or so of use to pay itself off. So unless you run a water heater 24/7 all year it is going to take much longer than that. Sure the price of one card may drop significantly, but individuals are still not going to use one over a space heater which will always cost way less than one miner.
If you already own a non profitable miner, than sure use it to heat a room or water, but I highly doubt it will be a good idea to buy one just to heat water, at least for individuals.

"not being able to change the rules by politics makes it unique"

Im aware of that. I mean come up with a plan for how we are going to go to larger blocks after segwit. I didn't mean scale before segwit. I'm saying why not have a plan set up for after it takes hold. It would be the easiest way to stop the whole conflict.

Thats fair but the purpose for the internet then was very different and it accomplished it well. IT has evolved into something very different now.
You could argue "bitcoin became valuable as digital gold rather than digital cash" which I think is fine, but it still failed at *ever* being digital cash. Maybe someday it will be, but it wasn't in 2011 when I first tried it and it isnt now, and doesn't seem like it will be for at least a another two years.
It makes me worry that it will never actually accomplish its original goal. And it seems more and more people are content with just changing the target and being happy saying you will never buy a coffee with  bitcoin. MANY people say that, and to me that means the community will never really care to make bitcoin be digital cash like I first learn about and desired.

This is something I have not yet heard. Could you give me information one what future capacity increases are possible due to segwit?

I am really curious what this alternative is.

I think it is problematic to assume everyone who supported classic felt that way. I personally think larger blocks would be good for bitcoin and don't fear hardforks. I certainly have no ties to the leadership of any of the proposed hardforks though. So its a strawman to say everyone who want/wanted such things were malicious and wanting a coup.
I want better scaling on chain.
I want segwit.
I want lightning.
I dont fear hardforks.
Don't assume people like me are all malicious, and it is harmful to say "it was never about 2MB at all" because at least for some of us, it was. Even if some people had other motives.

Like just open a "tab" with my friends or bar or shop and use lightning to keep track of my bill over a few months and settle it. Never caring about the fact that I could do me -&gt; friend -&gt; shop. Just do it on my own. Maybe just settle the thing after one transaction sometimes too, just at my discression.
I feel like the hard unsolved part of LN is the "network" bit, if I wanted to set something up without the network part is there already a working implementation I can use?

I have always been curious as to why that would effect the bitcoin economy. Other than raising the price since I would have to buy them to store them, I can't see how it would help grow the economy. It is just sitting there doing nothing if I just store it.

You missed my point. I didn't say let's increase scaling before segwit. I'm saying why not have a set plan for scaling after. I said not wait to have discussion for steps after segwit. Obviously we want segwit to come now. But if we had a plan that had support for what scaling was going to take place after segwit I imagine it would end most of the conflict.
@_date: 2016-12-09 14:54:36
My point is more about why we don't see payment channels now. There is nothing stopping payment channels now. Even if segwit is needed for lightning. What is the obstacle for payment channels now? It's hard to imagine that not being an intermediate step before lightening. So either I'm Missing something or we are much farther from lightning than I hoped.

I have been running a node out of my apartment for roughly 5 years now. Not continuously, taken in down for a few months here and there. Not sure why I do it, I dont even own any bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-21 06:44:13
I am not drinking any coolaid at r/btc I mostly want to learn for myself what the plan is. My goal is to have an honest discussion about these things to alivate my fears about scaling. I know I am not alone in these fears, and I wish people would do a better job discussing those scaling plans rather than just attacking big blockers. Currently I don't have enough info to argue against bigblockers because I don't know enough about the post segwit scaling plans. So if those things are in place why are they not the focus of discussion?
Schnorr signatures would require another softfork after segwit right? I understand the scaling benefits of Schnorr would be more noticeable after segwit. How would this softfork be done? Another 95% support from miners? Something else? Is there any reason this can not be done very quickly after segwit?
I am personally a big fan of lightning network, but it still has some issues. Routing seems like it will be hard to solve and may require people to just use in smaller communities. I am fine with that, but for me I imagine some things will be great for lightning but not all transactions and so we will still need some form of scaling on chain. Even if not right away.
I would love to read about proposed plans for a blocksize increase hard fork after segwit. Since that will probably be needed eventually, what are the plans for it. Which devs support doing that hard fork which ways. Obviously it will come down to the preference of the miners but a little more info for the at least proposed ideas for such a hardfork would be nice. I know some people used to support a 2mb hard fork with segwit and that got scrapped. So since that is gone, what is the hardfork plan after segwit. What metrics will need to be met for people to want to actually go through with a hardfork post segwit.
@_date: 2016-11-16 04:58:22
What are proposed solutions after segwit? I think thats the only real issue some people have. I am happy with segwit, I think it is great. I just want to know what the steps after are. So far I have not heard anything proposed for scaling increases after segwit.
Thats all I want, discussion for progress. Segwit is done now, I am running a node with 13.1. But I am not satisfied until there is continued discussion for how we are going to scale after segwit.
I am not trying to advocate anything specifically, just want to know why no one talks about the next step if they say segwit isnt the final solution.

Its things like this that I want to get excited for, but sadly you are right. No one cares to make bitcoin useful for stuff like this anymore. People have accepted that bitcoin will never be useful until a second layer.
So fucking fine, why not let me do a payment channel with AirBnB. Let me put in a bunch of money in a payment channel and pay for each rental in a long vacation with that payment channel. I don't need no fancy payment network, just a single payment channel with AirBnB.
Sadly no wallet supports and anything like that. And the fact that it isn't there makes me think the people who say "nah we need a second layer" are not even trying to make that happen.

Haha no way will that that happen here. Its a big government owned housing block. I tried to convince them to tske a bank transfer or a cheque. No luck. 
Most vwndors near by, how can I convice tben when they don't have an internet enabled payment of any sort. Most local restaurants don't have internet, and payment is done by buying tickets from a vending machine using physical coins or bills. This is done because then no one has to touch money and it's handled automatically. Why would such vendors pay for an internet connection just to facilitate my business. Most of the grocery stores near me don't accept anything but cash either and I'm certain they don't have an internet connection. 
Maybe I could convince somewhere but it would never be possible for me to live on just btc. I'm envious of your situation but most of the world is very very far from being able to function in life off btc. Unfortunately

Good! I should be allowed to write 100 clients all trying to do that.

There are no checks at all. I can't even cash a check at my japanese bank.
Online banking is pretty new here, some banks have some support of online banking but I don't know how much since my bank still can't do much of anything online other than look at my balance. You can do a bank transfer from an ATM which works similarly to bill pay but charges ~540 yen = $5.40 as a fee. There are many things that bank transfers are the only option though. Japan is very much a cash only society still.
@_date: 2016-09-10 04:45:42
I live in Japan. My rent can only be paid CASH. My bills can't be paid with a credit card. Debit cards don't exist here. So way Ltd than 50%of my spending.
Also even if they did, using a bitcoin credit card or debit cards means bitcoin isn't better than fiat, it's just the same as it. Bitcoin needs to be better, but just the same. My issue isn't really that is not useful yet for point of sale, it's that the community doesn't seem to think that's the number one priority. It would be fine if I felt it wasn't there yet but people were trying, many actually day it SHOULDN'T ever work at point of sale which makes me lose faith in the idea.
@_date: 2016-09-10 04:48:25
I agree maybe it Should be great for online purchase but sadly it doesn't seem to be. A credit card is better. This post about double spending shows we have to wait till confirmations for online purchase but that is easy longer than credit cards. This needs to be different, bitcoin should be magic internet money meaning the best option for online purchase.
@_date: 2016-09-05 05:52:25
what was it for those unfamiliar?
@_date: 2016-09-09 07:56:18
Yes, but guess what, most people don't spend much using bank wire. I get that some people think bitcoin can be successful being at just that level. IF people want bitcoin to replace cheques and bank transfers, fine, but then it is not a technology that interested me. I rarely use those things, so I will continue to rarely use bitcoin.
Thats the attitude that bothers me, people are fine with bitcoin being digital gold, or digital banking. Fine, but then stop calling it magical internet money  and stop trying to get more people to use it, it already works for those things. I want bitcoin to be successful, as a thing I can spend it on, as a replacement for fiat. It seems lunacy to me to accept "it is better than bank transfers" and also hold that it should replace fiat. It needs to be more than that for me and the world to get on board.
@_date: 2016-09-13 14:42:48
I don't online gamble, but the point should be bitcoin should be the best choice for MOST online purchases. Currently I only use it where it is better, which is maybe one or two uses a YEAR. It will never reach adoption if most cases the credit card just is better. 
If I do something like buy an audio book, I want to listen to it NOW. If I buy a game online I want it NOW. IF I make a micro transaction in a video game , I have no interest in waiting 30 minutes. It is not magic internet money if credit cards just do most things better.
If you don't care about those things fine, but also don't get upset when the rest of the world doesn't care about bitcoin. It seems like the community is just accepting that A) bitcoin is better for everything online when it isnt. and B) that people should only care about the few things it is better at while still holding C) everyone should adopt it over other forms of payment. Some people back peddle and say they don't want adoption, or they are happy with the minimal uses btc has, fine, but without addressing these concerns bitcoin will be stuck at the level it currently is at.
I love bitcoin as an idea, I want it to work, but I am not going to use it when a credit card is better and more convenient.

But that is the problem. If you have to wait 3 confirmations for things, it makes bitcoin less useful than a credit card. 30 minutes is not ok for digital services one would want to buy. Having to wait that long is just not good enough.

Maybe a credit card takes days but NO WHERE does that actually affect me anywhere. As a consumer, which is what matters for adoption, credit cards are better for me almost always. You can claim it takes 10-30 mins vs days, but what needs to work is the consumer can be given a good or service in seconds, like credit cards, and this double spend casino example shows bitcoin *cant* work for that.
Its fine to talk about the theoretical benefits of bitcoin for online purchases but this exact video shows why it isn't in practice. My point is that we need to find a way to fix this.

I get that most people say "well just don't accept zero-confirms" but to me that attitude is what makes me want to scream at this community.

There still are faucets. Just back in the day you could get 0.02 BTC from one. Now they give out 0.00001 BTC. 
But they are still there, the problem is they usually don't pay you immediately. Even still, there is enough interest in bitcoin, that bots will set up tons of accounts and milk the faucets so even if they pay out almost nothing, they need to have a bunch of hoops to prevent the bots.

One thing to note, is that even if there are ways of making this sort of thing work, there will always be instances where things go wrong and bitcoins are forever lost sometimes when someone dies. 
If bitcoin were survive for many many years, say years after mining is completely done, the supply of bitcoins would slowly decrease over time as they are lost.
I am sure the speculators will just say "thats great, value will go up due to decreased supply" but it could become an issue in the far far future if bitcoins were not divisible enough.

Personally I feel that if the only valid application will be in the transport layer and not the end user that it will always be too volatile and therefore bad for a transport layer.

Forking seems unlikely now, but I still think catastrophic events could cause it. Lets say a war broke out between china and the US, and all internet connectivity between the two nations. (Just chosen as examples, could be any two large portions of the network.) 
It becomes incredibly risky to trust any transactions during this period. You have no idea how long the network break will last, and it may end up all of your transactions will be in an orphaned chain the things reconned and the other side has a longer chain than yours.
Such a large global network distrubance would mean I wouldn't trust any currency as you would have bigger problems in the world than money supply. However I don't see any reason something like this is impossible.

In 2011 ~ 2012 I was mining on my GPU just for fun to learn about it. My dad asked if he should buy a few 100 BTC to play with. I told him not to and didn't think they would go anywhere just found them technically interesting.

I don't own very much of it, because I don't expect it to skyrocket. Personally I think it will continue to go down for quite some time.

I wouldn't call myself an early adopter though. I mined with my GPU around 2BTC, and then sold them at $1000 each. I never invested or bought any, just mined with my Gaming PC a few times to learn how to do it.

I agree. Bitcoin is just whatever miners choose to mine. No one else has any power.
My point is just it is pointless to tell someone to "just fork" because maybe they want to. You can tell someone "the miners don't like your idea" but it is totally missing the point to tell Someone just go fork already, because people have already done it. They just don't have any power or say if they are not miners.  
If you want a change your best hope is to discuss on forms like this to change enough minds to convince miners. So telling someone to shut up and try to fork is the same as just telling them to shut up.
I'm not trying to advocate any particular position but more hoping for open discussion and telling someone to go fork is equivalent to trying to quell discussion.

To "start a fork" you have to mine a block. When you say "why don't you just fork" I have, many times. So have hundreds of others, by just running alternative clients that would accept a block that doesnt match core protocol.
But that isn't what ANYONE means by hard fork, you need to mine at least one block to be a fork. Unless I can mine blocks there is literally nothing I can do to make a hard fork, of any kind. You need to stop saying to people to go ahead and hard fork if they want something because it is not something most people have the power to do.

In 2009 or 2010 I dont remember exactly, I learned about bitcoin, and set up a miner. I mined ~2BTC and sold them when the prices were at $1000/btc.
However in those early years I was talking to my dad about it and he told me "should I just buy like $100 worth of them?" I told him no because I didn't think they would ever take off in value, but were just a cool tech idea.

I really like the idea of lightening network, but I also like the idea of scaling bitcoin itself. I have not figured out why we can't do both.
I worry that off-chain solutions will cause people to not want to scale bitcoin itself and just hope they take off, but I also worry that off-chain solutions will be fragmented with a ton of different options eventually. This will be confusing, hurt mass adoption, and split the community into parts.
However things like lightning and others are really cool ideas, so I want to do those. I want to believe that lightning will be good enough that everyone (this community and the rest of the world at large) will switch to it and use it for everyday purchases.
What I don't really understand is why we can't *also* scale bitcoin now. I haven't been convinced by arguments not to bump it to 2mb or 10mb or unlimited, and why not right now. I don't see why supporting other layers means you don't want to scale bitcoin itself. 
I mean, don't we all agree that bitcoin itself will need to increase in size eventually? If so why not do it now when everyone demands it? I just don't quite get it.
I think the only criticism of the layers is that it adds complexity (they will be ONTOP of bitcoin) or that they will fragment the community. Linux distros have the problem of everyone wanting to do their own different thing which is great for diversity but bad for coordinated effort. Other layers will have some people sticking to just bitcoin, and others picking other layers, perhaps many different solutions for that. You run into the problem altcoins have where everyone wants their own idea rather than working together on one thing.

I own no capital. I essentially live month to month paychecks. I do sometimes have to pay bills back in my home country (USA) though I live and work in japan.
That's the price of being an academic, no money.
Still, if I did have capital, I would *NOT* keep it in bitcoin. I personally have never been convinced why the price should go up. It seems VASTLY over valued in my oppinion.
What I want is for bitcoin to become useful. That can happen at any value, it doesnt have to be any particular price to take off as useful. I have been following since back when I could mine coins on my GPU at home. I think the fact that the price ever reached a point that dedicated mining hardware was built was the worst thing to happen to bitcoin. If the exchange rate was still something like $1 to a btc then miners would get $25 per block and not significant money. I think the prices should have stayed there, but its out of hte bag now. Because the thing is if everyone only had &lt;1BTC it could still be useful, the price doesn't mater, just that it is stable and can be used to *buy* things which hasn't gotten any better the past 5 years I have followed btc.
I have less than one BTC at the moment, which is probably the same percent of my savings as you, since I have no savings to speak of. I follow bitcoin because I think it is an interesting technology that I would love to *USE* but I sure hope it doesn't change value, so why would I invest in it. The most useful thing to me would be if its prices never changed.

I think this is a small part of it. Even people who don't trust banks have reasons to use them over bitcoin. Fiat currencies are still far more stable in price than bitcoin.

An individual can't just fork things. Lets say I wanted to do so. To fork I need to be able to mine a block. Even if I bought a bunch of miners, there is no way me, by myself, can mine a block without joining a pool. And if it was just me and I do do it on my own it would take months in between the large blocks produced so there would be no reason to accept them. 
To fork requires some fraction of the mining network.

Its probably also people who had coins intending to use the market, now can't use the market so selling them off. 
Having a useful market GIVES the coins value. Removing their utility, of course the price should drop, even if the thieves did nothing with theirs.

But the problem isn't in layer two services in my opinion. Bitcoin just isn't better than a credit card for most consumers. Digital services often have reasons to wait until a confirmation or two, which means it's better for me to use a credit card. The current benefits of bitcoin are not needed by most people. As a core idea it needs to offer something to people, everyday people, that is better than a credit card. Levle two services could amplify those advantagea, but they need to be there for.
Not tied to governments or banks, or offering some anonymity are not features for most people. Being based on good  cryptography might be a benefit for us nerds, but is actually a negative for the public. It just doesn't offer anything to the public yet. And that needs to be fixed first.
@_date: 2016-05-24 15:39:29
Right, that is all I am saying. Some people are trying to tell me it is just the same as everything else... well fine, but don't tell non users it is instant because then when we try it and it isn't it doesn't make you guys look good.

It's fine if it isn't instant. I guess. It's just different than what I thought an internet currency would be. Also it's really not good that people advertise something as instant if it takes me 30mins. 
I'm sure bitcoin has a purpose but make sure folks like me don't get miss information and think it's instant because I really started to hate this when I sat their waiting 30 mins.

I guess it was external stuff linked from this subreddit. So I guess my disappointment is misplaced here. Sorry. I think it was a video or infographic linked her suggesting the advantages of bitcoin so I decided to give it another try.
I will try to find the video, it was ~1 week or so ago.
@_date: 2015-03-17 11:31:39
Ok cool. So using the wordlist, I can use some tool to generate the private keys, put those into a wallet.dat and using the core client (or some other thick client) get at my bitcoins? 
Seems like it might be a pain in the ass, but doable. Now I have a project to figure out. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 05:07:39
I like bitcoin for its utility. I think people who treat it as an investment are approaching it wrong. I want it to work so we have decentralized currency, not because I want to make money off the idea.
Good luck.
@_date: 2015-03-17 11:37:14
Well right "As far as I know" is different than proving to myself that is really what is going on. I understand that it is all open source and I could try to understand it, and that I am trying to do.
However I don't consider anything safe unless I am able to go through the backup and restore process myself (without the need of any external server/backup) So just one time I need to get at the private keys, and move them somewhere totally unrelated while offline to verify 1) that it works like intended 2) I know that I am capable of doing so in the case of some catastrophic failure :-)
@_date: 2015-03-19 07:45:23
I can see them being useful, but when they are, I don't see why they would have to be valued what they are now. I imagine they will become useful when the price drops back to like $10 a BTC, and no idea why they would have to go up. 
I know they are useful, they are already useful to me. Easiest way to share money with friends. I sold mine at $1000 because that was ridiculous. I still think they are over priced.
I totally imagine a future that everyone uses bitcoin, I just don't see why that will mean they have to be &gt;$100 per BTC. They can be the currency of the future at $1 of value as much as they could be at $1000. Its totally arbitrary.

If things are going well for you, that means the status quo is in your favor, and you don't want change. Why would you? A new system might not benefit you.

Ok but a normal user like me shouldn't have to study such things to make a simple internet purchase. It is clear from the other comments that I should not have used bitcoin for a simple internet purchase. My apologies.

I like to see the keys, as a cryptographer. If they are keys for something that doesn't matter (an account with zero or near zero funds) then playing with the crypto is something I think everyone should do.
Just don't play around with them when it is something that matters, leave that to trusted vetted software.
It also wont be wasted effort, it will be fun for me.

@_date: 2015-03-23 06:18:23
Who is this "they" that you think would want to stop bitcoin for these reasons.
Anyone in power is going to want to stop change of ANY KIND because it is the status quo that got them into power, and change might mean they can lose it.
There doesn't need to be any technical reason. And in the case of bitcoin I highly doubt there is. 
Of course banks want to keep things in the currencies they already have tons of. Of course governments want to be in control of issuing currency when it suits them. There doesn't need to be some criminal conspiracy to understand why large institutions would resist a change of currency.
@_date: 2015-03-27 16:11:18
The problems with multisig are not technical. The tech is there. Seriously if there was a thing that would help bit coin that I could code up myself I would do it.
@_date: 2016-10-25 05:32:13
This is currently the only thing I use BTC for. It doesn't have any use to me to keep any money in BTC (I wish I didn't but it doesn't) but it is very useful to send money between currency.
For me it requires having a bank account in both countries, and I do  get a ~$5 fee on one end just to initiate a transfer from BTC -&gt; yen, but it still comes out better and easier than using a more conventional exchange.
Since this seems to be bitcoins biggest strength at the moment it is good to use it to get people to try it.
@_date: 2015-03-18 05:35:47
The difference is transactions in bitcoin REQUIRE there to be inflation. The inflation of the USD is not tied to transactions.
@_date: 2016-10-03 04:14:34
I wish that was the focus of the community. Until it is easier and more useful than a credit card for a non tech person it won't really take off. Sadly I am not even sure its moving that direction, its about as easy to use as it was a few years back, and not really any better for a normal user.
@_date: 2015-10-09 04:55:26
I have about $3000 in my savings. So I have about $30 in BTC. I guess I should get more.
I really follow BTC still because I USED to have them. I sold them at $1000USD each at the peak (all 2BTC worth lol). So going to stay curious but I am out of the game.
@_date: 2016-05-24 10:13:48
I remember first learning about bitcoin around 2011 and I think it was instant then. But people still say such things. I find it hard to be considered an internet currency if it takes 30mins to spend it. I guess most people use it for exchange? Not really for spending? 
Oh well. My bad for thinking it was something I could spend easily. Still lots of info out there saying or suggesting it.
@_date: 2016-10-25 09:33:08
That's all reasonable points. But it has been 5 years since I learned about it and it isn't any more useful to buy goods and services now as it was then. It seems like it is for speculation, which rises price, which I feel activity takes away from the point I want it for. I wish no one held it and tried really hard to spend it on stuff. Because I don't care about investing. I want a useful currency which is digital and has a sound theoretical background to make it secure. The decentralization and other features are just bonus or irrelevant to me.
I get that there is interest in it and demand will increase the price, but it all seems pointless if it's not making progress on being useful. To me that means any moment it could collapse since there isn't any real use in the real world. When you can buy food or goods or pay rent and bills with it I'll keep money in it.
But I guess the biggest difference is you HAVE money to store somewhere. So you want to store it somewhere that will make money. I only have debt. Huge amounts. I only want "cash" that I can spend on things I need to live my life, and hope for massive inflation for currency.
@_date: 2015-10-09 05:15:11
Diversification is fine. But that's different than expecting/hoping it goes to the moon. Or goes up in price at all.
I think bitcoin has utility at its current value. And see no reason it needs to go up in price to be a great thing.

I honestly still feel bitcoin is way over priced.
I understand they have value, but we are so far from them being useful (able to buy goods and services) that I am not sure why they are not a fraction of their current price. I mean I guess the prices is completely arbitrary and you can just divide them into smaller parts, but still, just feels like they are way over valued.
@_date: 2015-03-19 07:48:18
I don't see why they have the value they do at all? I am not sure why anyone expects them to stay at any particular value until mass adoption. Once they become extremely popular, and a huge portion of goods and services use them, then sure the price will remain somewhat stable. However until then I don't see what requires them to be valued anywhere from $0.01 to $1000. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 07:11:02
My job pays me in fiat, and I can use it to pay my rent and buy food.

If I knew what that was I would.
@_date: 2015-03-17 11:02:09
Ok maybe that is how a thin client could work, but doesn't seem to be how it does. Mycelium and Electrum are connecting to their servers. Now maybe they COULD verify the blockchain in a p2p way, but they don't seem to be doing that.
I will believe they can work that way, but would need to do it myself to trust it. So say I send some bitcoins to a thin client, how do I then, offline, get the private keys associated with the client to recover them elsewhere? If I can't do that, I won't really trust them. I am sure you can but I need to know how.
@_date: 2015-03-17 14:06:20
Cool thanks.
I mean not professionally a cryptographer. I am a physicist, but did some cryptography during my masters. Been out of the bitcoin  game for a while (I sold all mine at $1000 :-) 
I live in Tokyo now, apparently there is a bar that accepts bitcoin so I figured I would get back into it. Didn't know anything about how the thin clients worked. I tried reading up but most sources just said they were secure or whatever, not the underlying principles/maths. I figured asking for better sources here would work, and it did :-)
Thanks for the links. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 10:58:50
Ok, so if I understand this correctly, I should be able to generate private keys using that word list, put them into a wallet file and access my bitcoins using a thick client without ever connecting to their servers? 
Is there a resource on how to do this? I could try to figure it out but that is what I would like to be able to do to ensure it works the way it seems.
@_date: 2015-03-27 07:09:49
Intellectually I think it is the right solution. However I don't think the world is ready for accept such a solution. I sold all of mine at $1000.
I like to follow the news, hope one day they will become useful for me. However I don't play the game in the sense that I don't have any anymore.
@_date: 2015-10-15 08:10:09
I am hostile to the idea that bitcoin should be treated as an investment. I think it totally misses the point and bothers because then it does seem like a scam. I want bitcoin to become useful, not for people to make money off of it. If the goal of adoption is so you or someone can get rich, then I don't want that. I want adoption so I can use a decentralized currency for everyday stuff. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 10:21:12
Really that's my only issue. I wish I had known it would take 10-30 mins. I would have used something else rather than waiting angry starting to hate bitcoin while I waited frustrated. 
Just trying to help by showing the perspective of a skeptical noob
@_date: 2016-05-24 09:19:58
Hmm. So bitcoin is not really suited well for online purchases of digital goods if you want them quickly? I was thinking in the future bitcoin could be used to buy things ingame, like digital items/powerups or whatever for video games, but if you have to wait (now ~30 mins for confirmation) that will never be something that can be done (not directly anyway.)
As someone who will probably remain just a consumer I guess it isn't going to be that useful then huh. Guess there needs to be some intermediate step? 
@_date: 2015-03-27 07:54:43
I suppose that depends on the heater.
@_date: 2016-05-24 09:22:14
I had not realized paying this way would be a sacrifice, which I guess is the problem. I guess merchants should be more up front with the downside of using bitcoin (having to wait ~30 mins for confirmation of payment) otherwise you are just going to get more disappointed folks like me. I am not trying to be critical, just giving feedback from someone who tried to use it. 
I guess I will have to read more to figure out what bitcoin can be  used for that other services don't satisfy.
@_date: 2016-05-24 10:14:46
Ya. I guess that's also an assumption I had about something that would be an internet currency. Seems unfortunate that bitcoin technology doesn't allow this. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 11:34:43
I understand that playing with the private keys is dangerous. I wont do that very often. I just need to know it CAN be done, because that is the part of bitcoin I understand. 
Basically I want to take a wallet like Mycelium, put a small amount on it, and go through the process with the private keys and recover it once.
After that, I will never again look at the private keys, start over with a fresh Mycelium account and trust it from then on.
However yes, taking the wordlist from one app and plugging that into a totally unrelated app and get my coins that way would be a first proof to myself of not being tied to the server.
@_date: 2015-03-17 12:59:01
Ok thanks for the idea. I will try that.
Then try to use that backup to have the other one recover the account.
@_date: 2015-10-09 01:37:59
Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be following bitcoin, because I don't have a networth.
@_date: 2015-10-15 08:05:51
I am not a buttcoiner but probably fit your second category. 
I love bitcoin, but I really against the idea of using it as an investment. I think that is pointless and only harms bitcoin. The whole idea of people trying to make money off it or get rich from bitcoin. It is a great piece of tech and I follow it because of the utility. However most people interested in bitcoin (at least the most vocal) seem to want to make money off of it.
I sold all my bitcoin at $1000USD, because I thought that was ridiculous and stupid. I currently own &lt;0.1BTC and don't really plan to get more. I want bitcoin to become USEFUL not go up in price. Its fine if adoption causes it to go up, but to me that's not the point and so I am often critical about anyone talking about investing in it.

@_date: 2016-07-01 00:27:50
Sadly I am not, I think if we need 2nd and 3rd layer solutions than why even bother with bitcoin. I get that not everyone feels that way.
I am stuck at this position where I fell in love with the idea of bitcoin 5 years ago (~2011) and was really excited for the future, unfortunately it seems we have made no progress towards the future I wanted and instead many people are admitting that bitcoin wont get there and many others saying it SHOULDN'T get there. Saying bitcoin is like digital gold not digital spendable currency and are happy with that. 
Personally if we need some other digital currency like system to facilitate everyday transactions, like lightning, why not just find a proper solution, a cryptocurrency which can be spent. I have never supported any altcoins, I think it hurts the overall movement, but people admitting bitcoin will never be better than paypal hurts it FAR more IMO. Maybe they are right, maybe the tech of bitcoin doesn't allow for replacing things like visa and paypal, but if they are, I am not interested.
I hope my statements don't come off as being anti-bitcoin. I just see so many people in this thread saying bitcoin doesnt/shouldnt/will never work as a payment network, and to me that 100% removes the value of bitcoin for me. Other people can still value it, I will continue to run my full node which I have kept running for 5 years. I want bitcoin to work. I just feel like other people have given up on the part of it I want. They can use it for other things, I don't need it for the reasons others currently value it.
@_date: 2016-05-24 10:19:47
