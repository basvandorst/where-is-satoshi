Won't find that on the regular web. Check @_date: 2016-04-28 02:17:55
at this point you might post the addresses here and see if people can see anything.

Yes you can. Just hit send btc and scan the spend part of your paper wallet.
@_date: 2014-07-15 04:10:21
I understand that. Still useless compared to real bitcoin sportsbooks. Until they actually operate in btc for btc users, they're useless.

Spitballing but Gyft Authy? Is it possible to see what apps a phone number downloads?

Withdraw in bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:48:25
You probably have a keylogger on computer and someone took over your igot account and changed the pw.
@_date: 2014-07-25 23:23:11
Same thing as Xapo except you guys are ready to operate? I mean not to sound pessimistic but until something is actually shown here I can't get on board.  The idea is great and a lot of people want it.

Can you send me 1$ instantly right now with fiat?
@_date: 2014-11-02 20:57:17
Same haha. Spent so much time putting together a nice cart then bam couldn't use the deal. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 22:27:24
Agreed. That's why it only makes sense to bet with 5dimes with bitcoin if they allow withdrawal in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:34:59
Actually surprised he wasn't able to make more.  2.6m is a lot of money but is it worth risking substantial prison time?

This is actually good news.  I had wanted to keep my btc in a time locked vault so mtgox is working out great!
@_date: 2014-07-14 20:03:31
Yea so basically it's useless for people in the US because what makes bitcoin useless for sports betting is the ease of use in that you can deposit/withdraw value instantly without jumping through hoops for USD.

It doesn't even offer bitcoin option when you click the button. Just says Paypal...

Set up a coinbase account.
@_date: 2015-08-15 14:37:37
It's no less hackable but there is a higher chance that legal recourse would occur if Coinbase was hacked and that customers would be covered in some way than if btc-e was hacked.  
@_date: 2015-08-15 14:48:16
True but like I said, it's just a perceived higher chance.  Suing may not do any good but I'm sure absolutely nothing would happen to btc-e if they went dark.  If Coinbase went dark, well, it's kind of impossible because everyone behind it is well known and US citizens.
@_date: 2015-08-30 14:35:31
Those are tracked funds...
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:03:56
Not really true. A lot of people used cb as an "exchange". You can easily surpass 20k with buying/selling just turning over a 1k total. Having 1k in value does not mean you can afford a lawyer. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 03:07:48
I'm wondering if it means total transactions amounting to over 20k in ONE of the types. Not one single 20k+ transaction.
@_date: 2018-02-27 03:15:22
It's one "transaction type", not one "transaction". Meaning your total buys could be more than 20k *total* through a year. Pull your transaction history of your account if you can. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:50:40
Yep, surprising/worrisome it's only 13k people though. Would have thought over 20k would apply to many more users.

Seems like if you got the email then they're indicating that the IRS is seeking records of your account.
@_date: 2015-04-29 03:00:08
Maybe because he wasn't operating it?
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:33:19
Wasn't he just the spokesperson?  It was my understanding that he wasn't running it, merely promoting it.  
@_date: 2015-04-27 02:05:27

@_date: 2016-10-24 14:46:44
You don't really have many options. Paypal frowns upon bitcoin transactions so offering them any sort of proof is out of the question as you do not have a money transmitter license. As everyone said in here, don't mess with Paypal for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-15 18:28:10
So purse.io owes mishax1 too because he has an order with a 114 prefix?
@_date: 2015-02-22 14:20:04
He did not run it. He was just the PR guy basically.
