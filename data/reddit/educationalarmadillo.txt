It won’t be profitable because the bitcoin miners are a large fixed capital expense that needs to be utilized 24/7 to pay off the investment, carting them around the country and running them every once in a while will not be good enough even if the energy is free.

Why even bother with hobby miners, confiscate all the ASICs owned by the Chinese mining cartels and you already own 70% of the hash power.
@_date: 2018-11-23 00:08:12
Well, not any more. Now it’s a “get poor quick” scheme.

Maybe he’s trying to humor his idiot son?
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:54:35
Did it ever occur to you that bitcoin payments have costs too, and those costs total way more than 1.5%?
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:55:38
Or so you’ve heard.
@_date: 2018-11-23 00:11:17


Most people do not think this. You should spend more time outside your libertarian doomsday prepper compound.
@_date: 2018-11-30 11:22:37
If all problems could be solved through sheer will, why do you think another clever entrepreneur will not find a way to lower credit card transaction costs even further below 1.5%?
@_date: 2019-01-11 23:05:28
Only because r/bitcoin loves spreading and believing obviously false rumors.

Actually this is what anarchism means: 
Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self-governed societies based on voluntary, cooperative institutions and the rejection of hierarchies those societies view as unjust. These institutions are often described as stateless societies, although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical or free associations. Anarchism holds capitalism, the state, and representative democracy to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful.

You’re an idiot
@_date: 2019-01-12 22:46:44
No it doesn’t.
@_date: 2019-01-24 22:42:39
None of these comments have any connection to reality.
@_date: 2019-01-21 10:46:40
Ancaps are a tiny fringe group which the majority of anarchists don’t consider anarchist, see the wikipedia article on anarchism I posted. The relevant part is here:


Ancaps would like to be considered anarchists because it would make them seem cool, but if wishes were horses beggars would ride.
@_date: 2019-01-11 22:55:32
Yes, and it’s the correct argument.
@_date: 2019-01-21 19:08:05
I expressed no opinion here. There’s your unfounded opinion, and then there’s the reality which is reflected in the wikipedia page. Anarchism is an anti-capitalist ideology, ancaps are not real anarchists, nobody except libertarians cares about the NAP. Deal with it.
@_date: 2019-01-18 18:59:39
Most anarchists do not follow any kind of non-aggression principle, it’s not mentioned even once on the wikipedia page. Also most anarchists do believe in certain laws you need to follow whether you like them or not, or face the consequences.

The real answer is that bitcoin’s linear PoW security model is incredibly flawed. The cost of a double spend or spam attack needs to be higher than the benefit of executing such an attack, which means the miner fees will always have to be a significant fraction of the total transaction volume, which makes the network too expensive to use for most purposes. Note that other payment networks do not suffer from this problem because they employ better, nonlinear security measures.
@_date: 2019-01-19 20:42:36
Right, it has nothing to do with anarchism, only with libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism.
@_date: 2018-11-23 00:19:38
Bitcoin’s wealth distribution is way, way more uneven than the real economy’s. Bitcoin is doing the exact opposite of what you think it is doing, it’s making the poor poorer and the rich richer. Don’t be so easily deceived.

Lol good luck demonstrating to the court that there is any real difference between bcash and bcore
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:31:21
Are people really this gullible?
@_date: 2018-12-08 23:03:31
Lol, I’ve already said it. You just don’t like the message because it makes it harder for you to con other people to burn their money to prop up your bags.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:54:16
yes it does
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:23:26
And oh how all the ancaps love him for it!

Be honest here, he did not start the website for ideals but to make lots and lots of money.

Prime bitcoiner material? You’re describing typical 4channers.
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:32:58
It’s almost as if this is a sub for stupid, deluded and dishonest people.
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:40:43
It’s just sad, thousands of fools will be financially ruined because they believe in nonsense claptrap like that.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:33:59


Haha, how is this relevant in any way? What secret information or insight do those people have that cannot be gained simply by looking at publicly available historical data?
Bitcoin is rife with this kind of magical thinking. Idgi.

Someone is telling barefaced lies on Well I never
@_date: 2018-12-09 21:46:27
Fiat currencies are valuable though.
@_date: 2018-12-16 22:46:05
True, a lot of the money is literally lit on fire by the miners so it’s in fact a negative sum game.
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:17:38


Practically a child!

You’ll find these incel memes aren’t that well received outside 4chan or possibly the_doland_turnp

This, this here is the dumbest argument.
