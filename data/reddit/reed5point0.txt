A quick rundown
the coins are "modular" in a heads / tails setup. Private keys can be stored in the middle once the two pieces are glued together.
I am working on resizing the Dogecoins tonight but the Bitcoin is the same diameter of a Poker Chip or Silver Dollar.
I work completely on the pay what you want system and 25% of all donations go back to reputable crypto charities.

Long story short: A buddy was asking if anyone could explain Bitcoin / Blockchain / Ethereum etc...This guy was in there trying to push his scam, and I kinda roasted him a little, and a few hours later I got randomly pulled into a convo to convert me.
Had to add the last photo in PS b/c I got removed before I could finish rotating /uploading it it

Good morning!
My question pertains to OKCoin in general. I am a big fan of Cryptocurrency as a whole, and was wondering...Do you all have any future plans of adding any more "altcoins" to your roster? 
Dogecoin has held pretty strong for over a year, the community is pretty great, and somehow they end up doing big things often.
 
Not to mention I would much rather exchange through OKCOIN over BTER.
Also are there any other Altcoins with features you enjoy?
EX: Darkcoins Darksend

Will do, I was under the impression Mt Gox was the "standard"

Merry Christmas! I just signed up on Mt Gox to see what all the hype is about. 2,014 is now my new goal as well!
