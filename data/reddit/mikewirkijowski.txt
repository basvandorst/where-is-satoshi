I think 5k will have a strong bounce back but if THAT bounce doesnt start a big bull run(worth media attention) than brace yourselves for about 4k.
Of course its a theory like any other and most probably im wrong as im not a pro

Lmao frozen wallet. So you didnt even check if its really a crypto ?
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:23:18
6800 was a major support because of mining profitability and the price didnt even bounce a tiny bit of it a month ago when the price dumped the most.

Yes but its controlled by a single private company, and also a greedy one, and that one thing leaves no questions as to what makes more sense as a currency.
But i didnt mean to make a whole discussion out of that because i didnt read the whole article so im not really a good candidate to discuss that with, just meant to say that this part of the title feels like a bad comparison for most people.

People were mad for BCH for calling itself bitcoin, some official posts were misleading on purpose to „steal” some customers. The bad pr just caught on.
From the technological side, i like both im not gonna bash anyone. Both have pros and cons. 
And its not like only bitcoin sub laughed at BCH. The opposite is just as common, its normal that people take sides and defend them, that rationalises their invesmtents in their head.
@_date: 2018-10-01 06:13:46
Buy bitcoin and input the adress of the person he wants to send bitcoin to.
I think it would work well, and i think increases anonymity if you are buying sth online.
@_date: 2019-11-05 11:28:59
Just stick to the plan thats all advice i have for you. 
Theres lots of temptation to move the funds to monero or to some crazy alt that popped up so its most important that you have a strict plan of action and follow it so that you dont do stupid gambling stuff

„Find out why bitcoin is better then WoW gold”
Wow what a great comparison lmao.

I never heard about cash app but just pay attention to where you can not only invest in bitcoin but actually own it, send it etc.
First of all create yourself a wallet using a wallet like Mycelium, electroneum or sth
When you have your wallet you can use coinbase or localbitcoins which are the most popular choices.
Oh and guard your private key with life. Its like a login and password in 1 so Yeah better store it offline on a piece of paper.
GL !
@_date: 2018-06-23 11:21:04
If you dont mind fees coinbase is piss easy

That would result in the biggest sell off ever. I cant wait lol
@_date: 2018-06-04 10:46:49
We are kind of missing the point of crypto if we arent actually holding the private key to our bitcoin adress
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:06:37
Ok i ran a small research to find out how much physical money we lose every year.
There is about 1,000,000,000,000 paper dollars in circulation and about 1,500,000,000 dollars get lost or worn out annually.
So we lose 0.15% yearly so we could actually go on for 333.3 years until we lose half the money without reprinting. I believe less bitcoin would be lost because you dont carry it in your pockets and it cant be physically destroyed , only sent to wrong adress or forgotten. So Yeah we should be fine and not worry.
P.s. : Interestingly enough only 2-3% of dollars is paper money, the rest is digital, IE checks etc so we could say that we actually only lose about 0.003% yearly and we could last 16667 years until we lost half of the dollars in existence
@_date: 2018-06-03 10:54:57
My personal life ? 0 except for trading gains.
But I can see bitcoin working in some places like thepiratebay donations, and in the future as an non official international currency, but as of now its hard to notice btc anywhere in everyday life

I think such commercials are overwhelming for everyday people and i know it from experience.
More than 1 year ago i was in london and i saw a crypto trading commercial and saw all those different cryptonames and thought to myself "wtf are all those scammy names" 
IMO people start recognising ETH because of cryptokitties and BTC because it is btc, after adoption of those is over Maybe people will become open for more advanced propositions
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:55:23

I dont think you are the one who makes rules so Maybe drop the btc idea. I dont know much about hollywood myself but i have a few friends who are trying to make it in to film industry in NYC and already have some amazing offers and from what I understand the industry isnt looking for you at all. You have to go ahead, send the screenplay to all the right right people, go meet people from industry try to get to know valuable people and showcase your idea and pray to god someone notices you. Its not like there arent enough people with good screenplays, you need them to notice you and you have to work hard for this and when you are lucky enough someone wants to pay the million dollars then Maybe kindly ask if they can pay you in btc
Edit 1: Also having someone who is in the industry who could promote it is almost mandatory, its hard dropping a mill for an anonymous, when you know the right people you will find all your answers, dont leave yourself in the hands of blind luck

Whats the advantage of 3D printed ones vs classic silicon molds for CIEMS which are out for years ?  Silicon seems more flexible and comfortable and making an ear mold should be more precise than translating it to a 3D model just to print it out.

Oh sorry. I didnt mean just day traders. I meant all the people who sell everytime they think there is a psychological barrier when there is none. They are the ones who create it. There is no other logic behind those sells other than "Oh most will sell on 10k and so will I" so its a vicious cycle and it just goes on until a massive buy order is set

In my opinion useless for the next couple of years. What I mean is the person still needs to cash it all out the moment he receives the payment as he needs to realise the project. Maybe it would  have some sort of functionality if it was based on a good ETH smart contract as it would  give the project a trustless edge over normal kickstarter and would decentralise it. But sending money to a 3rd party using bitcoin just adds more problems and doesnt solve any.
Edit: fixed some mistakes

2^256 combinations. Theoretically someone could make a million guesses a minute  for a billion years and he still would have much less than 1 in a trillion chance  to make a valid guess. Much less of a chance but im too lazy to make the math now
Edit : corrected number
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:46:11
I dont know where its from but its impossible to send accidentally to an adress you dont know. There are 2^96 combinations possible . You could send to a million adresses a day and our solar system wouldnt live to the day you sent to a legit adress.
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:48:50
Yes although 2^256 is guessing a specific key. But still the number of existing keys doesnt make a real difference for us (funny when making something 30 million times easier doesnt make a difference lol) 
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:22:46
I wish we broke it man. Just make it a whole community effort to buy the shit out of it, it would benefit everyone in the end bringing attention back to the big Ol' bitcoin. I feel like most people are daytraders who want to accumulate but with No price progress they are digging their own grave.

It mostly depends on how eager people are to sell  so i think its impossible to estimate. If everyone one day assumed "Fuck it im not selling till 20k" the price would explode straight to 20k once people would start buying
