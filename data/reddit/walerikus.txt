If you are not dealing with cryptocurrency is it ok to use revolut? 
@_date: 2018-10-27 10:55:06
That's good 
@_date: 2018-10-29 12:21:24
Check the top gainers today ibtc a
@_date: 2018-10-26 22:52:02
Is there any other Stable coin?
@_date: 2019-06-01 15:59:23
So crypto is your new cash :)
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:43:13
That's a bad sign
@_date: 2019-06-09 15:00:41
Controlling hash power doesn't necessary mean controlling funds of the Bitcoin protocol users. By getting more hash power miners get the ability to serve the Bitcoin blockchain and to mine more bitcoins. They can't modify much things on transactions and they can't have full control over the protocol, getting more hash power is getting more access to verify transactions, and not to modify them.

I'm interested in opinion you guys do have, I have my own strategy accumulating more bitcoins
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:47:51
I am not trying to tell you that you won't do it someday, everything is possible, manage your risks hold fiat that you only can afford to lose
@_date: 2019-06-09 06:19:08
Thanks for highlighting. The US debt is 20 trillion dollars, global countries debt is over 60 trillion dollars. Fiat money has a big flow that won't end up well.

If I don't make mistake you could buy a house with 500 dollars a century ago
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:51:16
Yes it may come, think on investing in something that may generate income or to be liquid enough so I could sell without losing much money
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:35:47
You are well packed �� nice strategy
@_date: 2019-06-09 14:13:33
Interesting opinion, for me the main point of decentralization is that there is no central party that has control over your funds and your account.

What is ET?
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:37:11
And he is right, there is no other better store of value than Bitcoin, the price of BTC 2 years ago was around 1000$, but it's not the price that matters, it's the privacy and anonymity, no central control over your funds, this is incredible
@_date: 2019-01-29 22:33:05
Same story here, I have lost over 140.000$ and still holding :) I believe the game is not over yet, we might see another tremendous peaks. The biggest part of my profits I have got were from undervalued non popular cryptos that became popular after the exponential growth. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 17:13:16
There is a blockchain explorer where you can see the total amount of bitcoins 
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:58:09
Burning in hell?
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:38:22
The lowest prices of Bitcoin since Q4 2017
2017 September 15 - 3.292 $ (China Ban)
2017 November 13 - 6.063 $ (JP Morgan FUD &amp; start buying BTC to ATH)
2018 February 6 - 6.227 $ (JP Morgan starts desperately shorting BTC)
2018 April 6 - 6.615 $ (Seems JP Morgan Fails)
@_date: 2019-05-29 00:04:00
Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, this is historical
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:34:45
Does it require the miners to run the updated version of protocol? Do the miners and nodes have choice not to accept such an update?
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:52:40
No matter who votes and who is elected, one who has the real power and authority is the one who controls money, so the banking system picks anyone they want to promote to be voted, making people think that it is their own decision. In this case there is no chance to call it democracy. 
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:51:28
How about features, as Bitcoin escrow accounts, there is a lack of some kind protection of a customer and merchant.
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:37:53
I have tried it with small cap cryptos, it works, but it's difficult to short ones that have some value, holders won't sell cheap lol :)
@_date: 2019-05-28 23:54:06
Great strategy, I have left with only 10% of my funds in fiat money, and I have a big doubt if it is a high risk to hold 10% in fiat money.
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:28:55
I don't ask why, theoretically, is it possible to be applied on a current blockchain or there must be a fork?
@_date: 2018-12-30 14:04:59
You are stupid 
@_date: 2018-12-21 10:59:10
That's why we need decentralized exchanges 
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:09:21
Ok, deleting it 
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:35:17
On Bitcoin org page is says that transaction to invalid address will not be supported by blockchain system, so they won't be sent 
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:13:04
We have no real democracy governments 
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:12:39
USD inflation is the real deal 
@_date: 2018-12-02 13:49:53
Indo-European :)
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:29:25
We have oligarchy, the voting is fake. 
@_date: 2019-05-28 23:49:25
You forgot to mention belarussian rubles and iranian dinars or Turkish lira, lol
@_date: 2018-12-09 12:21:57
Does bitmex trade real Bitcoin or only options? On coinmarketcap you can see bitmex Bitcoin price is indicated as derivatives unlike other exchanges that indicate the spot price of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:55:57
But do you really believe CME affected the Bitcoin market? BTC futures volume is barely 5% of cryptocurrency exchange markets on Bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:44:33
Great, thanks, so no matter what update a part of miners would agree to run, the basic version of Bitcoin still will be running until there are enough miners and nodes to sustain the chain.
@_date: 2018-12-09 12:38:52
Do you know the daily USD volume of BTC futures contracts traded on CME &amp; CBOE? 
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:50:08
C correction wave, everyone believe in strong bear market presence

Interesting how people change their investment strategy, do you think of buying some goods or property as an investment at some point probably on a new all time high?
