You can count me in a thousands time !!! Replace "bitcoin" with "blockchain" in all these claims, and i'd find it ridiculous and wrong. But the mass need to stop being sheep and understand there is way more convenient coins, even as simple currency and "store of value" (lol), there is faster, and cheaper way to transact, and the only way these tech will be adopted is to bitcoin price to die and become a legacy currency. Its happening.

What on earth have to be censored with BTC? At least a smart contract platform like ethereum actually have content not to be censored. But it seems like you confuse "blockchain" and "bitcoin". Ape money you are.

Like, 1% of scam. At least ETH have a use case. What your shitcoin is doing except the most basic blockchain tech application possible (a currency). It's unscalable, slow and expensive. And be sure if you ever have Rootstock one day you'll encounter the same scam and security issues. Retarded coin.

Bitcoin... This legacy shitcoin is a plague for crypto, gonna bring the whole legit market in it's fall. Buy Ethereum.

So one can say btc is controlled by one group as well. The roadmap is pretty clear and so far no delays. The "surface attack" is wider because of its inherent revolutionary value proposition : Turing-Completeness and Rich Statefulness environment, smart contracts, plus a currency : eth. If you don't get that btc and dash cant be compared to ethereum nothing can be done for your poor ass. 
The only purpose of btc is speculation. And i made better return with eth this year. lmao.
