Hold the BTC trade eth for xmr as things could get dirty for pos tokens. Besides Charts for XMR are better than eth. But try to trade when xmr hits 105 range. Privacy and PoW is where its at.

A lot of people including me actually want it to go down another 50% so that the milienials that moed last year can buy it. Milenials can buy a 2k coin but not a 5k coin thats the way it is. And the biggest group of enthusiasts are milenials.
