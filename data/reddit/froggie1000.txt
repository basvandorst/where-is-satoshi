Many of the negative reviews there are not for xcoins.io, but for scam imitation sites designed only to steal from you.
Many people have been stung by these sites, and afterwards, they still don't realize that they went to the wrong site.
If you intend to use this platform, make sure you use the correct link. 
Here is the correct link (with my referral code at the end):

I agree. It's well worth checking out. I've done a few $k volume in xCoins over the last few months and I'm pretty happy with the results so far.

I'm 100% convinced it's not a scam. AFAIK no users have complained about being scammed by xCoins - just poor customer support.
The lending/borrowing thing is confusing at first. Perhaps xCoins use these terms instead of selling/buying to avoid certain regulatory issues, but it makes no difference to the users. xCoins acts as escrow service for the Bitcoin side of the transaction, allow buyers to purchase via credit card risk free. Once the $ have arrived, the BTC are released automatically. Occasionally glitches do happen, but these are always sorted out, albeit sometimes slower than they should be.

If it's your first purchase, then the delay is probably because they are verifying your ID

Also, regarding charge-backs, often they are resolved in the seller's favor. Sometimes this is automatic (i.e. requiring no input from the seller) and sometimes it is necessary for the seller to present the digitally signed contract and photo ID of the buyer. It does happen that the buyer (read "scammer") wins the dispute. In this case, the 50% profit guarantee program kicks in, the seller is reimbursed (up to a point) and the fraudulent buyer is perma-banned from xCoins. It is impossible to eliminate charge-backs using the current system, but the risks can be managed and is worth the 15%* premium for some.
* I say 15%, but in reality, due to fees and commissions, your profit will be a little lower. You can use this promotional code when signing up to reduce your fees by up 25%: **hel7ly**
