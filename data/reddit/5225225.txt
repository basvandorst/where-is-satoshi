But there is NO way for you to get anything back if you send to the wrong address or something like that, unless they send it back. (Which is the point)
It also means that they can't set up recurring payments, you have to manage that yourself. (Which is positive and negative)

None of those are peer to peer systems. (Except electricity, but that's not the main focus, although you *can* sell electricity back to the grid).

If it's good enough for ssh-keygen, it ought to be good enough for bitcoins. Really, there's no point in using random.

I'm tempted to do that, but am kinda worried about fucking it up and then I no longer get any email, which I rely on. How is your email set up?

Do I need to have control over the backup server, and does it have to be the same username?
For example, normally getting emails at X and have the backup be xy

By the way, it uses urandom by default. So --random-source=/dev/urandom is redundant.

But are people sending emails directly as a SMTP server? Yes, the protocol itself is peer to peer, but the vast majority (or basically everyone) uses it over IMAP (or POP) / SMTP and *that* is client-server.

SMTP isn't really a peer to peer system. Nor is HTTP. They both have fairly clearly defined clients and servers.

It reads from /dev/urandom by default. Which *is* secure.

Yep, found it.
Actually, I wouldn't mind a BTC miner with all the profits sent off to the software creators if a notice was very clearly put on the screen, and it's heavily limited CPU usage.
I mean, I still wouldn't use it, but it would piss off a lot less people.

Or you could buy a CS:GO knife.

Likely the default bitcoin software, and verifying the executable to make sure it's the right one. Easier to trust that way.

Just did the maths, some items are selling for around 1100 (FN dragonlore is the most expensive item I've found so far at 700 keys).
That's less than I thought it was going to be.

It wouldn't be. Even if the HDD is damaged, there are recovery methods (ddrescue?), or even if it doesn't read at all, you can take it to be recovered.
