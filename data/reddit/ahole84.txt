It looks pretty much the same except it's about 10x cheaper?
@_date: 2016-04-14 16:13:27
If your going to quote me at least quote what I actually said. I said they look pretty much the same. 
The question was asked why someone would buy a fake rolex and I've explained why. It doesn't really matter if you would be embarrassed to wear a fake one, people buy them because they look close to the real thing and some of them are pretty convincing although u need to spend a few quid for the better ones. Tbh I don't wear watches but wearing a fake rolex wouldn't embarrass me or phase me whatsoever. To each their own though.

Does the screen door effect still exist or have they sorted it?
@_date: 2016-04-09 14:41:29
Vanity why else.
@_date: 2016-04-09 14:50:47
Obviously it's not the same it's a cheap knockoff. I don't know why your arguing the fact. People buy cheap knockoffs all the time because they don't want to pay for the original even if the original thing is a lot better. Nobody is saying a fake one is as good as a real one.

How would I go about buying from local bit coins?  That's where I usually buy but obviously my card has dollars on it and all the listings are in the UK and want UK bank transfers. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:52:52
My favorite time for Bitcoin 2015 was the November bubble.  Boosted up to £325 in days.  Hopefully new ath in 2016 :) 
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:56:07
Id love one,  if only i had enough btc to justify it. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 21:39:20
How many Bitcoins did you buy and Then how many did you send? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:01:14
Correct yes.  I've had no problems with it at all. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 08:41:09
If I was to upgrade my node to the latest version then when could I expect an actual upgrade to bigger blocks?  I thought that was the whole reason for the hk agreement. I would upgrade to segwit if I knew we would get bigger blocks soon because it can't be denied that we need them. If bigger blocks are never to be implemented then BU is the only other option.
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:25:18
I think local Bitcoins would work best for you. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 13:37:25
There was me thinking getting to 1btc would be an achievement.  Congratulations. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 08:36:11
I was put off ether for good after getting spammed constantly in private messages about how great ether was.  Obviously a paid campaign. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:44:43
No. bank transfer and btc is held in escrow. Cash is an option but that would mean actually meeting someone whereas bank transfer is online and easy. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:38:32
If core added segwit plus 2mb blocks I think many bu would switch to core.
@_date: 2017-03-02 11:26:01
How far down the road are you talking for a 2mb fork? Or do you Mean segwit will effectively give us 2mb blocks? If your suggestion is to fork to 2mb in a few years then surely it will be too little too late? 
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:59:09
What do you Mean there was no agreement. Of course there was. I'm not bashing segwit and I'm aware of what it's trying to achieve but it's a band aid, I would be happy to upgrade to it if core had something in place for bigger blocks which is going to be needed /is now. How long do you think segwit is going to last us? It's already too small for the kind of run we've had recently. Imo core has everything pinned on segwit and lightning network with no intentions of ever increasing blocksize. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 08:22:59
I could actually do with a drop in price to stock up more.  Wheres to the moon guy when we need him. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 07:55:11
If your cheap like me then nothing better than a paper wallet.  If you have some cash to splash then get a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 12:24:42

Had it not been for bitcoin I would have never heard of or used circle,  I liked its convenience when you could buy from them but I'm pretty confident I will never use them for anything else.

Thank you kindly.

This I think is the best proposal.  It's meeting in the middle and will be more benefit than just doing one or the other.

Bitcoin ceo announced yesterday that next ATH will be this Thursday at high noon.
@_date: 2018-06-28 16:27:51
It doesn't indicate anything. Yes the difficulty increases with each additional character but if your cracking 10 digits in less than a minute or realistically a few seconds then you aren't going to be wasting your time swiping random addresses for a few btc.
@_date: 2016-11-14 13:33:04
No one has mentioned it that i can see yet but you may want to have a look around and see if he had any physical wallets lying about.  Generally these would be either a trezor, keepkey or ledger wallet. He may have also printed off paper wallets. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 22:05:01
Took me about 5 mins wondering why reddit told me i had a new message lol.  Legend thx. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:18:24
Checking the first and last 5 digits is perfectly safe though. If it ever gets to the point that those many digits could be regenerated on the fly then they already have the capability to crack any address in a fairly short amount of time. Remember the time to generate an address is literally the time between a copy and paste so the virus needs to either use a preset selection of the hackers wallet addresses or crunch an address in the amount of time it takes to copy nd paste your address. If the virus uses the victims computer even assuming he's running 10 1080ti s it's still going to take a ridiculous time to calculate a few characters of the address. And if the hacker has his own hardware that's capable of hashing that many addresses then he  already has the hardware power to crack any bitcoin address.
@_date: 2016-11-20 07:19:21
Thx,  at the moment i thought one of the complaints was that some people are stuck with 0 confirmations because of too small a fee.  I thought this was because the blocks are pretty full and higher fees take priority since miners pick them up.  My understanding was that segwit increased the number of transactions that can be squeezed into a block therefore the cheaper fees would be picked up and hopefully have less 0 confirmation transactions.  Is that wrong? 
@_date: 2018-06-28 09:34:32
If it was possible to generate the first 5 and last 5 in a couple of seconds then do you not think it would be more worthwhile to just generate satoshis full address?
@_date: 2016-11-15 07:21:12
What exactly does this mean?  Will bitcoin be traded on Wall Street like stocks?

Although this is publicly known about i don't think they released details on how to make use of the security flaw so there's no real risk atm.
@_date: 2015-07-25 20:24:02
Sorry I'm total thick but why don't the bitcoins just go back into the paper wallet? 
@_date: 2015-07-28 07:20:36
Everyone seems to think the halving will put the price up but as it is a lot of miners barely cover electricity costs.  What incentive to mine will there be if it doesn't raise the price and miners are then losing money?  Obviously if price goes up mining will continue. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:13:21
Can't wait to power my drones with bitcoin, these lipos suck.

Last I looked selling Bitcoin on eBay was forbidden which could result in you more than likely losing your money if a dispute was made. 
Maybe this has changed now and selling btc on eBay is fine. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 13:12:51
The upcoming release of openbazaar is surely good news for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-09-20 20:16:53
Wow, must be my lucky day :), many thanks to you again :))

Are these the ones that used to get handed out by coincenter or something like that?  Unfortunately they where limited to america only which was a bit gutting. 
@_date: 2016-09-19 19:51:00
Where does the change tip go?  What wallet?  I only recently got tipped for the first time on reddit for 100 doge and I don't even know if I collected it right. 
@_date: 2016-09-19 17:08:38
If u want them off coinbase straight away then just download mycelium wallet for your phone (android)  and then you can transfer them from their onto a paper wallet.  There's no reason why u can't just send them straight to a paper wallet from coinbase though.  If you need help making a paper wallet safely then let me know and I will try and help. 
@_date: 2016-09-20 18:12:41
I always seem to just miss these ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
@_date: 2016-09-20 06:23:44
Thanks,  I created an account and managed to collect.  I had been wondering for ages how it worked but this is the first opportunity I've had to give it a try :) 
@_date: 2016-09-19 20:44:59
Ahh,  I never signed up to change tip.  That will be why.  Thx
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:11:33
If they went to a dollar I'd probably buy 2.
@_date: 2017-10-07 08:27:21
And how is this accomplished?
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:02:52
So in your opinion etc is the correct ethereum?
@_date: 2016-10-20 12:57:25
Which exchange did you send it from?  Some need you to confirm the withdrawal by email. If that's the case just Check your email. 
@_date: 2015-11-25 13:19:07
I have almost the exact same story minus the backup.  Phone in water  (s5, not as water proof as one would hope)  dried out eventually but had to reflash the rom since it was completely corrupt.  Tried a deep scan using some data recovery program but no dice.  0.5 btc gone,  I even know the address since it was sent from my computer but obviously that's not much use. 
Moral of the story...... 
Back that shit up. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 10:11:52
Last I looked at coin Base they didn't accept UK bank cards,  I had a quick look and it looks like u can withdraw from it although there is a £30 fee which seems quite steep.

I like local bit coins I've just never sold any there and the process is quite slow compared to just clicking sell and they are all gone. 
@_date: 2016-05-29 19:40:46
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:30:03
Disagree completely, forking is not the best route to take. The whole blocksize debate has been over preventing a fork and now misguided core supporters wish to fork on purpose? Segwit was supposed to be put in place and prevent a fork not cause it.  To be clear, I want segwit but not with uasf,  no reason not to just raise to 2mb and segwit. It's the best compromise for both party's.
@_date: 2015-11-17 08:15:53
Can anyone comment on the price change from the last time it happened?  Did it go up, down or stay the same? 
@_date: 2016-05-30 10:13:44
Your joking?  1 percent drops are usually followed by 100s of posts proclaiming bitcoins death. 
@_date: 2015-11-21 18:41:08
Local bit coins  is the easiest option in the UK in my opinion. 
@_date: 2015-11-25 16:12:27
Unfortunately I was using bitcoin wallet at the time,  I may have even backed up but of course that back up would have saved the file to my phones internal memory.  I now use mycelium and have the words written down though  ☺
@_date: 2015-11-20 07:22:18
I don't see the problem,  I'd be delighted if someone started throwing money at me.  Btc tipping is just making a kind gesture. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 18:30:01
I don't mind doing this if you know of a safe way to do it. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:16:39
Good if you currently don't mind paying about 200 over most other exchanges.

I only have a few concerns,  what rate would we be taking as btc is fluctuating a fair bit these days. 
What if you decide to pull out after I've already paid for the items? 
What would be your plan for escrow and who would be covering escrow fees? 
@_date: 2016-05-30 10:40:20
If the miners can manipulate the price by that much then they wont need to dump since they will still be mining at a profit. Even if price didnt rise,  miners will still be making a profit.

Hopefully open bazaar arrives soon,  if eBay has no btc option then I will probably just do all my selling on bazaar. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:53:51
Would it not be a better idea if everyone signals for segwit + 2mb blocks? Segwit by itself isn't going to put a dent in the current fee problem.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:18:16
*so far
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:39:35
Raising to 2mb is hardly going to affect centralisation though is it. It doesn't solve the problem in the end but it gets us out of the current shit we are in.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:24:35
Lightning which there is no actual sign of? When a simple block size increase could fix all these problems right now?
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:03:22
If the uasf group do decide to fork themselves off the main chain and create an alt then I'd imagine price would go up quite drastically before hand in order for everyone to maximise gains. To do so people would sell all alts before the split to increase btc holdings and the amount held on each fork. The users would then buy back into preferred Alts and sell coins on the uasf chain to gain whatever small value it may hold. That's my take on it anyway, I'm probably wrong though ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
