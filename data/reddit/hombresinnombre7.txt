The best place to hide a thing... is in plain sight. Even now, he has lots of wiggle room. There's no proof... look at how people are bouncing back and forth!
It's especially brilliant if Satoshi or Nakamoto are common first or surnames in Japan. Like James Jones.

You, too, mate... be good.

Dollars to donuts, he's got vans on his lawns as we speak, Magical... Vagina!

Alright, then. I apologize for losing it.

I knew *A* "Deon Sanders" but not *THE* "Deon Sanders." Tell everyone that he's a retiree that just happens to have the same name as the bitcoin founder. 
I'm sure he knows this one, btw. I bet YOU'RE panicking, not him. ;)

Fear Uncertainty Doubt... mean anything to you?

Oh, right. Yes, of course. How could I forget? The Internet. Where everyone reads at 20 MegaWord per minute, because that's their internet's connection speed.
The captioned photo to which my comment pertains says something like "master of encryption.. uses real name." 
My comment indicates that using your real name, if it is something like Jim Jones, may *actually be* the most anonymous thing to do.
Your comment intones an idea that I never posited, which is that it is okay for this journalist to do what she did. Which is not a thing that I ever said. I never suggested that not being able to prove he is Satoshi exonerates the consequential chain of events.
I keep forgetting about our public schools. For that, I apologize.
I am really trying to say that without knowing to what lengths this reporter went to crack Satoshi's anonymity, you can not say that Satoshi is an idiot for using his real name. That is all. That is all I am trying to say. I wish that you could understand my English. It is so difficult to communicate even very small ideas with my terrible English.
My very small point about hiding in plain sight, as pertains to the original submission is now officially lost to the the torrent of internet comments that are completely unrelated to the idea that I *was* trying to posit.
I feel gratified that I was able to contribute to society today. Reddit is so much fun. I think I'll go outside.
You can acknowledge my small contribution, assuming you have understood my horrible English, with an upvote if you like, but I have to be honest, I feel that I am speaking into the wind.

He denied it. Which means... it must be true.
