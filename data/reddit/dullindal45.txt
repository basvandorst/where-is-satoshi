”Even to another wallet” - what do you mean? You have to pay capital tax on the fees, but that's about it, right? You don't pay capital taxes when you move your coins from Electrum to Bitcoin Core, or from an exchange to Bitcoin Core, right? That'd be fucking absurd.

0% fee trading isn't all that far from wash trading, IMO.

Mind telling me what your objections to my argument are?

Why not? That comes down to approx. $104 per month over a period of 48 months, which is a pretty marginal amount, IMO.

Yes, that would be a good strategy. Don't give them any ideas, man! lol
Ross probably created the site, and then the government probably infiltrated SR. They used to do that with carder forums, spending millions in tax-payer funds over the years.

I'm pretty sure there's some degree of truth to what BTC_Forever is saying. 
I don't have proof, but the official narrative stinks of parallel construction. 
You'd have to be naive to believe that Silk Road was built on a 'wing and a prayer' (as Ross put it in his 'diary') by someone with just ad hoc programming knowledge.
Karpeles and Barr? Maybe, as Karpeles had the technical skills to pull it off.
Also, Gary Alfond of the IRS claims he found Ross's e-mail address through a Google search. 
Custom date searches are notoriously unreliable (I get results for 'Satoshi Nakamoto' and 'Bitcoin' from 2007!) and easy to fake (especially if you're the NSA).
Finally, the arrest of Alexandre Cazes of Alpha Bay further corroborates the theory that the government employed parallel construction in Ross' case.
If you'll remember, the government claims they were able to catch Cazes in part because he used his personal e-mail address in a welcome e-mail sent to newly registered users on the site.
They want to portray both Ross and Cazes' downfall as the result of poor opsec practices.
I find this hard to believe, especially considering how all Ross, Blake Benthall (SR 2) and Cazes supposedly got caught through lazy and easily avoidable security missteps.

1. Not a bad ROI if your goal is to smear BTC's good name. We know the NSA was tracking crypto users through very sophisticated means. What better way to poison public perception while at the same time gathering massive amounts of intel on BTC users?
2. Never mentioned covert ops. I operate under the assumption they have an unlimited fiat budget, seeing as the government can print money at will.
3. Ross might have tried to spill his guts, but I doubt he would have been given a voice.
4. That's a good argument. Usually they just murder people, but I suppose they decided to use him as an example. Life in prison is a much harsher punishment than death.
They did kill Cazes, though.

Zaif was great until they fucked up and got hacked.
But now that I think of it, there's no way JPY has surpassed USD in BTC trading. 
Zaif and Coincheck do $20 million, Liquid does $100 million, but they don't charge fees. Only Bitflyer charges fees, and they handle $50 million on a good day.
Unless the data on Coinmarketcap is wrong, but I doubt it. 600k BTC volume is absolutely insane.

Can't really participate because I already have everything In cold storage anyway. Cool initiative, though.
People should remove the coins and not put them back. 
Exchanges can and WILL get hacked. I learned my lesson after almost losing 0.18 BTC after the Zaif exchange in Japan was hacked. 
Never trust, always verify.

I've never paid any fees to trade BTC. I was GETTING PAID to trade on Zaif.jp. 0.01% or some BS number like that.
 It's 0% now, although admitedly they don't do crazy amounts of volume or anything. Same on Coincheck, IIRC.Maybe $20 million on both exchanges combined.

I highly doubt he ever ordered a hit on anyone. And even if he did, I don't think it would be in violation of the non-agression principle. 
To the best of DPR's knowledge, Curtis Green had stolen his property, so according to Rothbard (whom DPR admired), he would have been justified in the use of force in retribution.

Really? Do you have a link? The lady at the tax office told me the only taxable events were a) when you sell for fiat, b) when you sell for other cryptos, or c) when you exchange crypto for goods and services.
EDIT: The freaks at the National Tax Agency don't say anything about regular wallet-wallet, exchange-wallet or exchange-exchange TXs constituting a taxable event.
