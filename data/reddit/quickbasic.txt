Some retail stores sell Battle.net balance cards. You might be able to buy or have someone buy those and add them the codes to your account to buy it.

Nice. I actually want to move to ZA someday, so it's good to know that I might be able to spend crypto there.
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:51:25
Are there a lot of crypto users in ZA?

Even if waited until a few seconds before a block was historically mined and submitted an identical block that was pre-calculated in the future, he'd just be giving the original miner the block reward for that block anyway... as soon as he changes the block to give him the block reward, it would be a completely different nonce and he'd have to calculate a completely different block and every block on the chain after it would be different than historically recorded, so he'd have no advantage.
The only way he could take his future knowledge in the past and profit would be to take modern CPUs, GPUs, or miners (if they supported the protocol version), earlier than they were invented and use them to be more profitable than the miners in the current time.
Even then, knowing that Bitcoin would be valuable in the future, you could simply use local to the timeline hardware in 2010 and mine a crap ton of coins relatively easily, and jump forward with your wallet key to claim them in the present. A lot of people mining back then didn't know how valuable those coins would be when they mined them and so sold early. You can just make a stop off in 2017 to sell, and continue back up to 2019 for max profit.

Just make sure you take them off the exchange before you jump back to 2019 with your wallet key.

This whole thread is full of people who don't know how Bitcoin even works.
The whole "wallet" containing "coins" verbiage that we use is super misleading. We should have called wallets "keyrings" for the ledger or something to make it more clear that they only unlocked coins on the ledger not held actual coins in the wallet in a way that they could be taken with you.
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:55:58
Your explanation on why he's wrong is almost as bad as this whole thread.
This started with this question:


Nothing, because Bitcoin is not "inside" of your wallet, your wallet is a cryptographic key that unlocks Bitcoin on the blockchain. It's a way to prove that you have permission to sign a transaction on the ledger to move coins to another address. Your wallet is probably still valid and could be used (if loaded into era appropriate Bitcoin wallet software), but would be empty because when it scans the blockchain there are no coins signed such that you could claim them with your cryptographic key.


If I traveled back to the 1990s I wouldn't be able to use my current credit card either (even though technology to read it exists), because the account that is encoded on the magnetic strip does not exist. It's is an apt comparison because in the same way your wallet references something that doesn't exist, your credit card references an account number that doesn't exist. So what was saying makes complete sense and you're the one that is lost. They way you're describing Bitcoin as allowing multiple coins to exist or not is a complete misunderstanding of how Bitcoin works... your wallet is not a thumbdrive that contains a magic code that is a Bitcoin that can be copy and pasted, it's a cryptographic key for Bitcoin that exists somewhere else (the ledger).
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:11:47


They can't bring Bitcoin back in time with them. Bitcoin only exist on the ledger in blocks, your wallet contains a key to unlock the coins you own on the blockchain, it doesn't actually contain any Bitcoin itself. If the blocks haven't been mined yet, when their wallet scans the blockchain in 2010 it won't find any coins signed to them.

I'm honestly relatively ignorant when it comes both to investing and to Bitcoin. I simply max out my employer match in my 401k and get as close to 5500 in my Roth IRA each year as I can. I can see my money growing in my retirement accounts, but Bitcoin doesn't have that benefit.
Without knowing what price Bitcoin is going to be at 35 years from now, I'll not really know if my Bitcoin investing over those years was worth what I could have got by making similar contributions to investment accounts over that same timeframe.
@_date: 2017-01-14 15:05:49
I'm in it for the long haul and I'm looking forward to 5,10,15,20,30 years from now seeing the benefit of buying Bitcoin, but I still struggle with wondering about whether whether my money would be better spent investing traditionally.
Money in my 401k or IRA compounds. Every year I see gains and gains on gains. The first time I saw the $700 of gains in one year on my 401k balance of $8k, I was hooked. That $700 is going to get me gains going forward.
I'm not going to spend hours a day day trading, so am I just supposed to hold out hope that Bitcoin someday will have much more value? Because if I don't believe in the $20k BTC price someday happening it feels like my liquidity is sitting and not working for me.
I've tried but I can't find any information comparing BTC investing vs compound interest. Don't get me wrong. I am buying BTC because I feel like it's the future of currency, but I'm not sure how I feel about it as an investment vehicle. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:46:45
Yeah, I believe so. I've never really used it, but the bank I work at offers it.

I'm not sure how you intend for the person on earth to break the literal speed limit of the universe and know information from 4 light years away in order to double spend the transaction?
I know we joke about Bitcoin is not for coffee and all because nobody is going to wait for enough confirmations etc etc, but someone 4 light years away isn't going to give me my coffee until 8 years later when they can see at least the transaction reached the mempool.
@_date: 2018-06-16 00:54:38
I mean, if I'm transmitting a transaction from Mars and it gets to Earth in 24mins or Satoshi transmits a valid transaction from Alpha Centari and it takes 4 years to get here, as long as it's a valid transaction when it arrives at Earth, it can enter the mempool and be included in a block. I doubt mining Bitcoin on Mars would be profitable given the amount of invalid blocks you'd end up mining, but Bitcoin would still be operational at that distance for Mars colonists, they'd just have to wait a lot longer to know that transactions had been confirmed. 
Hell, this is Bitcoin with Lightning, so assuming it works as advertised, there's no reason there couldn't be a network of Lightning nodes on Mars, and around Alpha Centari, that could be used for everyday transactions, that only need to be settled to the chain if you're planning on traveling back to earth and need to use the main chain there.

Oh gawd... I've played with people in their 50s and 60s and they love telling you that you can't play words because they weren't allowed words when they started playing. That's why using the official scrabble dictionary and using challenge rules that cause them to lose their turn on an invalid challenge is the only way to play.

I disagree... Double Cheeseburgers could be obtained for $0.39 each on Wednesdays some time of the 90s. I was a lazy gamer who didn't want to leave the house for food, so I would literally buy 100 and freeze them. Vacuum sealed and rehaeted in the microwave, they taste like the day you buy them even a month later.

The point is that cryptocurrency isn't the only investment vehicle that can safeguard your money from inflation... not "deez gainz tho lololol".
For instance, the company I work for matches 100% of my 401k contributions up to 5% of my salary... I'd be a dumbass to not invest pre-tax and double that money for free. (It also lowers my MAGI by the amount I contribute, so I have a little bit more wiggle room for my capital gains.) They allow me to borrow against my vested balance at the prime rate, so I can still invest a good chunk of that pre-tax money in crypto and still have some lower risk retirement money.
You may have gotten in early, but gains like yours are not typical... You can't time the market always. I'm looking at the 30+ year picture, not the immediate one.

It certainly would reduce the search space... I'm not qualified to run the numbers on how much it would though.
