Hola. Eres el unico que comenta en español. 
Las pistas hay que tomarlas en cuenta por el orden en que las dan y como las dan (ha sido muy enfatico al enumerarlas) Estuve pensando es las referencias en que se baso el whitepaper, es decir los libros contienen el mensaje. Sin embargo como sabemos el whitepaper contiene la respuesta. Algo me dice q esto es mas sencillo de lo que parece.

I have an idea in the nakamoto white paper and the clues that took me to 1980, although it is only a small idea with the Merkell tree

But we must clarify something here, that I have seen that nobody has taken into account. Unless I'm wrong, they can correct me. When a user creates a wallet in this case in blockchain, it is the same system that chooses the words that will be the seed to retrieve the private key, the user does not choose the words, so the system may place some found in the whitepaper but you can also place several that are not inside the WP, so you must also take into account the words that are not related to the document. If my argument is not valid, they can correct me.

Public addresses in Bitcoin can start with a 1 or 3. The most common is to see addresses with 1. The addresses with 3 at the beginning are multi-signature payments. A multi-signature payment has two or more private keys and all must sign the payment that you want to make to release the balance of a public key. 
That is, we have a public key with two or more keys to release the bitcoin. starts at 3 ... 
Who tells me something encouraging?
