Oh Really? You find that Cool?
Than you should see my cluster of Arduinos trading Bitcoin and altcoins on multiple platforms, plus my cluster of Raspberry PIs mining 50 different coins, plus my swarm of drones going to multiple places to exchange the coins for cash, and my neighbour that I turned into a remote controlled cyborg with a magnetic brain inducing wave helmet doing my bank deposits. 
All I need to do is sit in my mom's basement turned into NOC room, with a super powerfull refurbished dual monitor Lenovo Thinkcenter with Core i3 processor, 4gb of Ram, and the old hard drive replaced by a 128Gb SSD, all bought on ebay with my VIP Paypal account with easy payments. 
This is so well setup that I don't even worry about it or anything. I just sit browsing and bullshiting on Reddit all day pretending to be a normal guy.

That where I saw the bullshit flag!

What I see is whales driving the price, specially on CEX.IO. But lets just pretend that bitcoin is totally free floating just because it is not centralized.

This circle jerk in this post is amazingly abhorrent!
Sure there are the more and the less experient. The novice and the old school. But I can recognize some of the idiots here full of shit talking with bare chest when not long ago they were the ones crying. 
Just because you are wee now doesn't mean you'll be well forever. It will come to you as well at some point, and the last who laughs.....
People who are really that well, don't need to bash other. Losers!

Oh man... it happened to me so many times... 
Buy and hold no matter what. Or buy and trade and be ready to deal with the risks. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:17:13
It doesn't take to much to figure it out. 
Anybody with a brain and not blinded with the illusions of getting rich quick with bitcoin is able to see it. 
They set two wales to drive the prices and frame the volatility between values that are not profitable for small traders.

And you seem to have been living in a cave!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:47:29
Yeah, everything it is possible, even returning to the caves...

the use of IP addresses is limited to the necessity of use which is relative to the amount of machines that we produce, and most not necessarily need a public IP address and in most cases they just need 1 IP.
However we already have billions or humans, and many are needy or greaddy as fuck and may want to have as many bitcoins as possible.

That's the only addiction I regret dropping. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:27:20
You had only 50&amp; chances of being wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:53:01
Should I buy or should I sell....
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:46:24
Yeahp, you got it!!  :)
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:23:16
Now the question is: Would you buy everything I own? Or would you sell me your bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:47:17
What makes you think so?
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:57:45
Sometimes I wish Bitcoin crashes once for all so those greedy fuckers stick their worthless whales up their asses and have diarrhea for the rest of their lives for the damage they did.

They are doing the same with the Real estate market abroad.   
People think it is corrupt rich Chinese investing abroad. But most are funded by the Chinese government through groups loyal to the regime.

Minutes before, [placing the buy orders](
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:46:09
yeah, sure. Soon people will start paying to get rid of their bitcoins. /s

Well, I'm a user of CEX for years since it was a platform trading mining power (GHS), and I can't complain about deposits or withdraws. I use it most for quick buy/sale bitcoins for commerce. 
However, regarding trading, the volume is quite small so I guess it would be a good platform for small traders. It is not. 
I don't consider myself a small trader as I have a quite fair amount of bitcoins and I could easily take advantage of a platform like that, however, for the sake of the market I don't. Why? Because if we want Bitcoin to succeed into the future we should't be greedy and rack everything. 
I don't think everybody is supposed to think like me. But at least the platforms admins should, but it is not the case of CEX.
With my background in software development, I have done quite a few experiments with robots connected to the CEX API, and explored all possibilities of automatic trading with it. However, not getting much into tech details, looking at the way there's some robot wales there (There's always a couple 30BTC on each side), and the way they operate, there's no way they are users. They can only be integrated into the core system. 
So, my conclusion is that, not only this platform collects trading commission, it manipulates the trading for profit. I would never trade there.
