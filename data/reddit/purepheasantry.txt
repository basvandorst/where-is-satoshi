Saw that as I was typing, literally just blew through 16k, dipped back down and here we are at 15,999. What a time to be alive! Lol

So long as you are comfortable with losing it. What type of gains are you looking for? If you put in 1,000 dollars and are looking for a 10% return for example, with BTC being 16k per coin, it would have to rise $1,600 for you to see a $100 profit. Keep in mind the transaction fees to move BTC/USD back and forth. Good luck!

It's interesting seeing the unique addresses heading up as well.
I wonder how many are in for the long haul and how the futures market will affect pricing.

This was a pretty cool read with regards to Crypto and failsafes against quantum computing

Funny, I thought I saw Bitcoin running through the streets just before all meth'd up yelling out "Choo Choooo"

notice the symbolism for 42? It’s the meaning of life.
Just a thought.

I’ve been in since early summer and figured at least a 3 year hold, never imagined it skyrocket like this so quickly.

I started with Coinbase for its ease of use and then migrated everything over to a Hardware Wallet - Nano Ledger S
