Okay. Good to know. Still Bitcoin is a commodity and not a currency

Thanks. To bring reasoning into this. Of course its not a currency as it has no government that can inflate it endlessly.
Its a commodity.

Okay Okay. You have convinced me. From now on I will call it both too.
But the title of the linked article is still shit. As you should then compare it to commodities and currencies.

Okay I understand. But as BTC is not used that much for payment but more for trading/investing. I would still call it commodity. Maybe in the future thid changes.

It's too good to be true. On eBay you get starbucks cards for 10% less.
As long it is not clear where the other 10% coming from it screams for exit scam or similar

Where are the 20% discount coming from? I do not understand the economics behind the discount. So I do not trust them
Sounds like free money.
