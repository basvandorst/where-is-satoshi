*Or really of humanity in general*, to put it bluntly.

Well, it is known as the hedge coin.
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:24:20
why didnt the core dev team write the code? genuinely curious.

Storage might be cheap for you, tell that to the village in China who uses  btc as a revenue stream, or someone in Venezuela. And 8MB block could knock these people off completely. It will just further centralize everything, which is exactly the opposite of what its supposed to be.  
One day, yes, hdd space will be cheap for everyone, but for much of the developing world it is not.

The best way I've heard it described:  
Checking account - BCH/ETH/NEO/LTC/VTC/whatever you like here  
Savings account - BTC  
so long as bch gets a bunch of nodes there is no reason why both can't exist.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:08:25
How the hell can coinbase do this? I'd be pretty pissed.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:40:17
This is great! What is the purpose of trump in the upper left?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:59:36
If the ledger for bch is enormous, thus rendering only a handful of nodes can verify the ledger, then it is no different from a bank and you are shortsighted to keep your money in something that can be controlled so easily.  It doesn't matter if bch goes to 100k. Everyone is going to be SOL when those handful of nodes decide to rewrite the ledger to whatever they want in a simple 51% attack, or when the government(s) just physically shut down the nodes themselves. I mean until recently there was like 2 AWS miners on this coin, that is not safe and requires a level of trust I just cannot get behind.
Furthermore, some people have bandwidth and/or big brother concerns, making the 1mb block a much more attractive option. There are plenty of reasons to keep the original chain alive. Someone with no internet can even transfer funds with the satellite or whatever, right? That could be important to some people.
So far as I can tell, there has been no rigorous academic study of the block size and how it relates to our governments and the current hardware situation. We *can't* keep upping the block size forever unless a few things happen: we figure out a way to get around the slowing of moores law (what happens when blocks are getting into the GB?), we finally get some real net neutrality and eliminate data caps (again, what happens when the block size gets to GB?).  It would be nice if there was a "block clock" that scientists could use to let the community know its a good time to legitimately up the block size.
not sure what you are on about with creating fake moneys or whatever.   Can you clarify on this bit?
There is no way around the fact that the best answer is high level, complex, and what is inevitably slow research on the arrangement of the block. We must fit as much into the block as possible in order to achieve maximum decentralization. Without decentralization there is nothing.

He is probably just trying to get in on the sweet sweet USDT train, amiriteguys?

Damn, some subconscious artistry coming out there! Prolly been watchin too much news :P

Shareholder capitalism in particular. Stakeholder capitalism that focuses on horizontal strength for *real goods* is sustainable, imo.

Because eventually people run out of money to buy things. Look at what is happening to American malls. Its not that people don't like going to malls, its that many are paycheck to paycheck making needs-purchases only.

Funny you say artificial scarcity! Bitcoin scarcity is hard-coded, by a human hand!
@_date: 2018-03-10 06:19:29
Actually, because everything is moving away from one another, we have to developer faster than light travel to get to any of those galaxies outside of our own cluster. One day, with the exception of the moon, humans are destined to look at a completely black night sky. 
edit- i know this doesn't contribute to the conversation, but its a neat factoid.
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:14:19
I know, just was trying to inform ya a bit as it seems English is not your first language :)  
Down with hate.
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:22:00
Oh, well I would think if your an internet trillionaire, I am sure you can find someone to ferry you and your interests out of the country. It may be worth the risk for that kind of money.
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:34:30
Well put. I agree completely.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:16:48
Yeo! And it was terrible.
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:08:53
Yeh I agree, people are huge ninnies.
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:49:31
People love the intrigue, plus if you are trading you want to be ahead of the curve, or the candle stick, I should say.
@_date: 2017-09-20 01:53:20
Is this not why ripple exists? to replace slow transfer processes?
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:52:56
no it wasnt, that software has always sucked dirty ass, then went mouth.
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:17:59
What are you qualifying as "worse"?  I guess is my question.
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:17:31
well I would imagine that would put its market cap well into the trillions making it a truly stable currency. I mean it would take a shift of monumental proportions to move a market that size any measurable distance, perhaps even out of the reach of governments completely.
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:40:41
Seems to leave it open, but hinted szabo could be half of the equation. Who knows though.
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:43:05
That can happen anywhere though..
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:19:01
well, guess im a fucking rocket man than..
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:33:33
I dont know enough about the dev team to know why this occurred, but your complaint *is* valid.  We are all big blockers, its just a matter of timing and devOps process.
What I can say is that bitcoin is not a business, so sometimes slowdown in work can happen with big open source projects like this, particularly when things are contentious and the lead dev disappears (satoshi..). We just have to be patient, *but your complaint is valid*, I don't want you to think I just dismiss it outright.  
Arrange the block appropriately, and then scale. It is the only right way. I know people don't like to hear it, but it is true.
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:30:09
Exactly, one of the benefits of crypto currency is that it is going to challenge, and perhaps even break completely (over a long period of time) the idea of geological borders.  
Also, I think the word you want is "nationalism", not "racism". Racism meaning one person inherently believes they are superior. Nationalism is just too much pride in your country.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:39:12
That is awesome, thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:13:40
What do you mean by stagnate? 
@_date: 2017-09-20 01:40:46
How likely is it big miners cut and haul ass out of country? Im reading that is being talked about already.
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:38:41
What is to be gained? Seems like the branding of bitcoin is what they are after.
@_date: 2017-10-05 08:58:06
I agree, I dont see why we even need 2x when we have litecoin.
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:51:38
idk, I rather like the idea that it was a gift that was given to us to use how we see fit. One day we will know, I think.  
Until then, it is fun to conjecture and speculate!
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:04:49
I cant say I understand enough of the core team, or the code, to say one way or the other whether I agree with you. My first question would be, what is the motive for core doing that, to increase the value of their own stacks? I guess my second question would be, could you be underestimating the increase in value bitcoin receives *precisely* because of this scarcity?  
Personally, I am not sure bitcoin or any of its forks will succeed for the very long term. Something like VTC or ethereum/neo will take over at some point. Not for a while though, that is a long-term development I think will happen.
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:42:38
A world wide centralized trust network? What do you mean? The entire point is that it is trustless.  
Anyways, thanks for translating! Most of us know you Chinese folks are good people who put your pants on one leg at a time, just like we do =D
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:32:26
Any centralization is bad, whether it be development or mining.
@_date: 2017-10-05 09:38:02
This is what I have been saying, with Atomic Swaps, Lightning Network why do we even need 2x? 
@_date: 2017-09-22 01:59:16
I got my trevor in the mail too! I was a day late, and was too much like the todd model. Fuck todd.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:43:43
I dont keep up with the ins and outs of the repository, how is the development centralized? Genuinely curious.
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:28:49
Sounds like english is his second language, I think he used racism incorrectly. I think he meant "Nationalism" or some identity like that, in the context of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:07:25
Or GRS or VTC or SYS. It makes no sense, either bch is way overvalued or the orher forks are way undervalued. Maybe both.
