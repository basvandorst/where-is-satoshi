Trezor Model T. 
Done.. B O O M.
You pay a bit more but super nice UI and open source.
And more wallet support for shitcoin down the road.
Not that you’d want to hold much shitcoin.
Sell now... and buy BTC
Ot at least don’t fool yourself and buy additional
BTC for the win.

Buy with Coinbase Pro using a Limit order (set to buy BTC when price drops below the current value.)
Limit order: so if BTC is $9000... set the limit order to purchase BTC at $8950 for example.
This Limit order purchase makes you the “maker” in the maker-taker set up and allows you to purchase at 
.15% instead of double .30%.
Now take your newly purchased BTC from Coinbase Pro and “withdrawal” it for FREE to your own wallet (HD wallet like Trezor is good idea).
Now you own your Private Keys.... it’s your responsibility.

Two schools of thought...
1. USD is fucked long term. So buy BTC now as the long term store of value
2. USD will survive. 
     BTC will survive.
     So have some of each.
Personally, I am old enough (in my mid 40’s) to be vested in both. 
If I were in my 20’s... Fuck it... I’m in 100% BTC

Wait till next Friday.... paycheck -  20% BTC purchase!

Let’s keep BTC at 10k until next week....
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:54:19
I really want to believe in both ETH and LTC.
I’m just hoping that BTC can adopt the viruses of ETH smart contracts via Side Chians. 
And do what LTC can do via Lightning.

As a new user, you are limited to a .01 BTC transaction.
You can be the Maker - make an offer to buy up to .01 BTC or sell up to .01 BTC.
You can be the Taker - take someone else’s already posted offer to buy up to .01 BTC.

80% BTC
20% ETH / Alt
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:58:15
I’m sorry,  ?
Just kidding, Homes.
I have a little too.  
Back when I thought Alt was a good idea...
Fingers crossed for the future. Still holding.

Will BTC and BCH ever co-exist?!
Or is it dog-eat-dog?
@_date: 2019-12-19 06:35:33
Ben, 
Do you provide these new broadcasts in a podcast format?
Or only video via YouTube?
I would love to listen to podcast format while driving to work.
Just my input... thanks for your excellent content.
I really do enjoy the BTC Sessions YouTube videos as well!!
