And when was the last time you did that? And did you use Bitcoin or some other form of Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:11:03
Exactly! I will just use LN once in my life, make a post about it for some karma (maybe also at just to piss of Roger Ver and the evil chinese miners) and then keep on hodling. What retard would use Bitcoin to buy and sell with? You don't buy and sell things directly with gold now do you? No, you sell the gold and then use money. Much much simpler and easier.

Very smart!

Nice, I can't wait to not use Bitcoin at McDonalds but it's nice that I might possibly have the option in 18 months.

How many segwits is a satoshi? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:46:02
This is SAD! With LN network you would just take a subscription with a LN provider and pay maybe as low as a couple of dollars a month for unlimited free transactions.

Who cares if it becomes fully operational? I am just going to buy ONE coffee, go on and tell everybody that I bought a coffee with it for some karma. And then never use it for the rest of my life. I don't need it. Who uses Bitcoin to buy stuff with? You would not buy something with gold would you? Nah Bitcoin is a gift from heaven for speculators like me because it only ever goes up! Hodlers don't need LN.

Segwit is a lot better then bigger blocks. With bigger blocks the banks win. With segwit and LN we can scale to the moon!

Cool! I did not know that. Do you think McDonalds will also support LN?

Thank you that is a  very good analogy for a newbie like me.

Bribing the devil is a bad idea, he will just ask more next time. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:30:59
I don't fiddle.

Is this a bad omen? First time I am selling some bitcoin, just my luck. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 21:08:23
Fair enough.

Bitcoin Core is the backbone of the Bitcoin network. Almost all Bitcoin wallets rely on Bitcoin Core in one way or another. This is why sometimes people use the term "Bitcoin Core" because Bitcoin Core gives Bitcoin more legitimacy. It's also the software that Satoshi personally worked on together with Gavin Andresen and many early Bitcoin devs like Greg Maxwell and others.

It makes Bitcoin better by improving the Lightning Network. 
edit: Why am I getting downvotes? Read the fricking paper! It fixes the watchtower problem that LN has. What is wrong with you guys? If you don't understand documents like this then anybody can tell you anything and you will believe it.

Rusty Russel did a lot of work on linux networking programs like iptables. He knows his stuff. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 21:09:00
That was not my intention. All I was trying to say was that I am familiar with Christian Decker and Rusty Russell their coding and they are good coders.

I should have used the search first, sorry.
