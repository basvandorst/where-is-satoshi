A place that actually trades. It’s usually within $100 give or take of the other markets.

+1 to this! Do your own research to anticipate the market. Although this can be hard and just an estimate at best, it’s much better than following someone else who has different goals and agendas.

Hahaha doesn’t sound like bullshit at all actually. That was the type of answer I was looking for. Very true and just like any other commodity, fractions and purity can be purchased. I guess only time will tell but with the way things are going, I hope they never stop. Like you said, there will be hurdles but if past hurdles are anything to go by, it will jump them and get stronger!

That’s what I mean by the more expensive it gets the more it leaps. But to what extent will this continue to. I know this is like asking for a time machine but doesn’t it seem insane that it will still be booming higher at 30k, 40k, 60k, 100k? I really just want some knowledge
