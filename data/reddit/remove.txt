Why don't people just buy at one exchange where the price is 110 and sell at another where the price is 120?

Technically they have a plurality, since it's under 50% it's not a majority. But you're right, a lot of people are still using them.

I hear ya. Here's the thing. If their own website's documentation says it will take a couple of weeks, that *should* be trustworthy enough. If they don't accurately explain how long it will probably take, that's misleading. One shouldn't have to search around for horror stories of how long a withdrawal could possibly take to get an idea of how long it will take. That is simply not okay for a business trying its best to be regarded as legitimate.
The customer service keeps telling me, each week, that my withdrawal will be processed "soon." That's sounding pretty misleading too at this point.

Let us know if a customer *ever* pays you in bitcoin.

That sounds pretty terrible, I'm sorry to hear that. On their site they say
"At the moment we are manually processing wire transfers and have a **slight** backlog as we create a new withdrawal system with our banking partners. Your withdrawal may take **two weeks or more** depending on the amount."
That comes off as pretty misleading given both of our experiences, and the experiences of others...

Thanks to these two North Americans.
@_date: 2013-09-30 14:25:07
Thanks, that's helpful.
@_date: 2013-09-30 14:09:11
Yes, the account was verified.
@_date: 2013-09-30 14:24:49
Thank you, this actually might help me. How do I cancel my withdrawal?
And where would you suggest transferring it to?

There is no such thing as an "AP press release." People and companies and organizations send releases to the Associated Press (among others), not the other way around. This was clearly written by somebody who doesn't know much about the news business.

Thanks. I'm kind of a noob to bitcoin, but honestly the fact that most of the people in the community seem to be, I don't know, kind of mean is really a turn off.
