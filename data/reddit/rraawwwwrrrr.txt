For example, this is just one list of bitcoin accepting webshops in Finland which I found by googling in finnish; Bitcoin accepting companies in finland
There is practically everything from movie tickets, luxury cars to porn. I remember the same list being a lot shorter a few years ago. Nice seeing it grow and grow.

Yes this. What would happen if lightning was released too early and then someone would find a bug and be able to steal billions of worth of coins? Not so good I presume.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:35:41
Ofcourse you would have a LN channel towards your employer. And immediately you have connection through that, to anyone your employers have a channel to.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:06:43
Thank you!

Now do it without banks. And with current fees and/or with LN.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:15:30
IMO its not about getting rid of banks. But remove the necessity to use banks in every thing we do related to money. There still will be banks, people do need lending and other services banks can provide, but its not feasible to include banks in every single thing I do with my moneys. If I want, I should be able to keep my money on me securely, and solely decide what I want to use it for.

Finnish website which I believe uses bitstamp behind it. No registration!, very low fees, same day or next day delivery always with netbank purchase. Just hit it with your address, name and pay. Thats it.

Adblocker + autoplay disabler are my most necessary plugins on my chrome. Works like a charm. Nothing autoplays without me clicking the video to start. Only a few bugs sometimes when I cant get the video to run at all without disabling the addon.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:26:34
0.1? I think you put the decimal in the wrong place mate. :)
21M bitcoins. 83M Germans. So on average, roughly 0.25 bitcoins per a German person. But the world has a lot, a lot more people than that.
Lets say a quarter of the world starts using bitcoin as their preferable currency. Lets say 2 billion people. That's about 0.01btc/person on average.
This doesn't take into account bitcoins that are assumed missing ofcourse.
I know this might not happen and bitcoin might die tomorrow, but it gives some perspective how early we are in this thing. Makes my hodling easy.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:43:47
This is a very nice presentation to 90% of the fud related to LN. Very nice work anyone who made it.

Lightning will mix up transactions also, not sure how securely or hard to analyze, but atleast on some level.
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:17:32
Is this true?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:58:46
This. Nobody should think that BTC is ready. We are in the very very very beginning. Its just about to get out of "nerd money" status. People should look a bit into the big picture, where bitcoin, at the moment, is just a blip at most. But a very dangerous blip that cannot be put back into the jar.

Avatrade lets btc/usd with mt4. Maybe they have mt5 support also and usd is as good as eur for you. GL.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:10:06
I mean, the order book is always green when the price goes lower, and red when it goes higher. But in reality, there must be buy orders when the price goes higher and sell orders then the price goes lower.
Like here:
Not a single sell order if we go below 4360.70
Not a single buy order if we go above 4360.99
But in reality traders use those orders, right?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:32:32
Very entertaining movie. :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:53:21
Fees. Bitcoin rewards are just to give incentive until we get enough mainstream that fees replace that incentive. Fees already make up more than half of the mining reward.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:50:50
Ive thought about that too. Its a good thing that the wealth that btc creates to early adopters doesnt pile that much to so few people.
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:55:39
More and more people in the developed world are fed up with the shit our current monetary controllers do. I believe this is mostly driven by rebellious young people who dont want to see our future under total control. Or maybe I just see what I want to see.

I already explained someone before that i bought once from bitstamp and immediately returned to my local finnish btc supplier. I think it was a difference of about of 3% vs &gt;10% when you accounted all expenses. 20 euros for depositing 200 on your account? Lol no thanks.

Any rationale or just throwing random numbers?
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:38:59
That a point of view i havent thought about. Interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:51:04
Most definitely in my opinion. Most people Ive spoken in Finland and other countries about bitcoin dont know what tether even is, but almost all young people I know are on some level hodlers of bitcoin. People around me are mostly engineers, which may explain partly the skew related to rest of the population but anyways. Its nice to know that my generation is atleast on some degree taking their monetary faith in their own hands and sensing the idiotic progress we have in todays world. I know bitcoin may not be the exact cryptocurrency to rise above all, but at the moment, most likely one.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:25:29
Umm no. I think she mistakebly talked about dollars and fiat in general.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:54:42
Yeah you are right. I mean, they havent fully understood bitcoins disruptiveness to the economy they live in. Or dont want to.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:49:12
As i said, im a finn. From finland. Have no clue about norway.
About finland i can say a few things.
Im an electrical automation engineer. So borderline software stuff. Thirties of age. I have a lot of software engineer friends through work and school. All of them are somehow related to either creating trading bots, pure trading (forex mostly), or crypto. Or all of them. Only older people i personally know who have bitcoins besides me is my father who got interested from a anarchy point of view. From my workplace only me and my partner have coins as far as i know. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:18:23
What are these?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:48:36
I think of it this way. Even if i could have amassed a whole 0.5 bitcoin. How many people there are in Germany, I think something maybe 60 million. So in the end 42 million bitcoin halves for 60 million people. But hey, its only Germany. Theres so few bitcoins compared to the whole pool of people on this planet.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:36:31
Thank you for a good reply!
My laptop is all the time plugged in at my house. Its from an era where i moved a lot. Going to get a desktop soon so that will stay probably to run the core node and maybe possibly lightning also if i manage to get it running when the time comes.
How do your channel become to be inbalanced? Do you mean that i make a transaction from the channel address or something?
What do you think, is it profitable to run a lightning node?
I would love to run a node for the greater good :)
How do your channel become to be inbalanced?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:15:26
That sounds.. reasonable and promising. No major resistance detected from their side, even though I doubt would they say anything before doing something restrictive or destructive to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:58:39
It could be that bying a coffee stuff goes through LN and your lambo purchase is done straight to main layer with bigger fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:19:49
To all those who kept complaining about not getting enough time or chance to get enough/full bitcoin. Heres a handout to you. Dont complain anymore, gonna be a lot harder after this.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:23:29
You seem to understand this stuff. I really dont. :D
I have core node running, is it normal for the inbound/outbound connections to be at around 8?
I have followed some port forwarding guides but im not sure if its correct.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:23:01
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:46:53
Yes. My question is, how are these shown on gdax sell/buy wall indicators?
So far no one has explained it. Are they added together and the result is what we see? Or is there for example 500 sell wall, and in addition there might be a 50 coin buy at that point we dont see?
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:14:53

How did you end up with this 9k amount? And in what country?
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:38:05
How do they make their money, from some type of spreads? And where does the initial pool of money come from?
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:33:13
No seriously. Do not give or show them to anyone.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:21:04
Exactly that has been talked about. Shorting, causing a drop, bying cheap coins. Double win.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:03:08
No one knows. There is no information about fees anywhere in the internet and especially on reddit. Unless ofcourse, you look at the hundreds of posts exactly like yours.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:27:59
Found another one boys!
Yes, I can run a node on my laptop. Running all the time as we speak. Nothing to do with mining.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:49:08
I bought some now, will buy a bit on sunday, and a bit more on monday. To average whatever comes. A lot of uncertainty ahead. Maybe a ridiculous high or a very large sale.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:26:10
Oh. Thank you for that info!
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:41:16
This is a good representation. If you believe bitcoin will be going mainstream, this will help to visualize it.
Judge yourself where we are. 
Personally, I believe we are in the very, very beginning of the first percentages.
But in reality, no one knows what will happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:17:52
Just bought more today. Got them in my own wallet in less than an hour.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:48:39
This is the correct answer.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:16:15
No? Ok, thanks. Gotta see tomorrow again. Currently shitfaced on a workgig in Norway. :D
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:12:45
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:32:26
Yeah. Since for many people are worried that they cant afford a whole bitcoin anymore. Which is absurd when you think about it in a context of bitcoins potential.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:03:20
Yes. If you would be the only one mining, you would make 10 min blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:32:29
If bitcoin price is now 17k. I make a buy order of 1 million bitcoins if the price reaches 20k. How does the graph show it? Since all orders that are above the current price are always sell orders.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:33:24
Basically a bitcoin address which ones private keys have never been online, ever. Paperwallet, hardwarewallet like trezor etc.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:40:57
Is this book too technical for non tech people to understand?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:09:09
If it works the same as mycelium you can reuse addresses or you can use new ones. All lead to your private address.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:43:48
For example: Same as a stop loss but the other way. I dont want to sell now, I want to sell if it drops below a certain level because in my plan it might indicate a larger drop.
In bying, I dont want to buy now, but i want to buy if a breakout happens upwards.
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:04:34
I did that port thing, i think. Is it normal to have around 8 connections in/out?
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:59:45
So, can i personally put up a lightning hub on my laptop (i already run a full core node on it)? And i can collect fees from those transactions i handle, or i can just process them for free?
As ive understood i have to lock some part of my bitcoins to do, but theres no risk of me losing them?
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:07:38

@_date: 2017-12-17 18:56:46
Ive been trying to ask here how do the buy orders above current price is shown on for example gdax, where buy/sell walls are shown but still dont understand. For example if i put a buy order if price rises to 21k, is it subtracted from sell orders or..?
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:57:47
This kind of timing the market comments here are bullshit imo. Ive been trading several currencies almost solely on big news on forex markets for a long time and very succesfully. Even if i catch this big news an hour late i still think btc will act on it on a longer time scale. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:42:43
Could you clarify me something, as i just bought my first coins and chose mycelium wallet.
The shorter string of nonsense is my address.
The long ass string, i assume my private key, of nonsense was created from the word list it showed me and which i wrote down. Is the word list and long string the same thing?
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:23:14
I buy my bitcoins from local finnish site. Bash in address, name and pay with bank transfer or card. Bitcoins on my address on next day every time, sometimes the same day if I do it in the mornkng. 300-500 euros purchase at a time and fees are total about 10 euros on that size purchases. But I guess you pay for your 'freedom' :D
Edit: I did one purchade from bitstamp. Same size, over 30 or maybe 40 euros of fees and all kind of paper sending etc. No thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:55:16
Im fairly certain some governments will try. How public takes it, is anyones guess. Do they say "fuck you, we already have one coin, which we trust and we dont trust the government" or do they just bend over and accept the gov.coin.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:15:54
Antonopolous said it good. If we need 2mb blocks now, by the time this thing is mainstream we need many orders of magnitude bigger blocks. With iot and mainstream adoption, block size goes to gigabytes, maybe petabytes which throws us to decentralization because not many people can participate at that point.
E: participation limit drives us to centralization ofcourse, not decentralization.

I very much believe in cryptocurrencies and their future, but these matters are what are holding it back from being adopted into general public. If its so very fucking confusing and hard to grasp for young people and even educated young people, how would anyone believe its possible for, for example my father and the like to start getting into. This will take time, lots of time, but thats a good thing, because in the meantime, I can buy more while I still can. :D
