JNUG is a decaying ETF, bad idea.

Ok, but what immediately tangible value does it have to banks, governments, or consumers? Why would I spend my fiat and risk buying something that has a significant downside risk and is much more difficult to buy things with?

Yea this is true, but I would say that Assange and Wikileaks as a whole should be subject to great skepticism. Just because they have called out the US government doesn't mean that they aren't trying to push their own form of propaganda, just like any and every other media outlet with a decent following.
There are many valid criticisms of Wikileaks, just as there are many praises. In reality not a single one of us knows the true motivations or alignment of Julian Assange or any media outlet and as such we should take great caution in believing a source simply because of its "reputation" as a whistle blower.
My personal take is that I believe Wikileaks is a mixed bag - I think most if not all of the content released by Wikileaks is valid, but I think that the timing and quantity of content released is calculated to fit an agenda which may not be any more beneficial to the American people than Fox News. So, if you can look past the implications then there is some real meat there to work with.
And to the point of the original post: Wikileaks shops are no longer being supported because companies don't want to be liable for providing funding to an entity that is being sued by the DNC and may or may not end up being under heavy scrutiny. Whether or not you think Wikileaks is legitimate is almost irrelevant in this case: they're in enough of a grey area that businesses are deciding that it's not worth the risk supporting them. It's really not that "insane" at all.

Julian Assange isn't exactly an innocent savior of democracy. Sure he's done some good things, but he's a man with an agenda that isn't necessarily beneficial to America.

It's pretty much instant. The query is made every 1 second or so, but this can be adjusted. I do not want to spam btc-e out of fear of some sort of refusal.

I responded to you via message, but to add to that message: I am in the process of setting up git right now.

I plan on updating this thread around something like mid-day tomorrow (Central Time Zone, America) and I'll have a link to a web server or repository or something of that nature.
EDIT: And by tomorrow, I mean today. =p

I love the influx of ideas. I'm not terribly familiar with MT4 but it seems extremely powerful and extensible provided that I could find the time to become familiar with the API.

Forgot to mention: it's just C# .NET 4.5.1 so for the majority of Windows users you can simply download the exe and run it (or download the source and compile it).
EDIT: And no I will not be providing a link to the source quite yet because I just threw most of it together tonight and I would like a few days to clean things up.
EDIT2: Lastly, before I go to bed I'd like to mention that I have many aspirations for this project. Programming this stuff is fun AND it makes me money, so it's a win-win. Anyways, here are some ideas I had in mind:
* "Wall Alerts": A sort of informational ticker on the top or bottom or perhaps pop-up boxes, alert noises, or even remote alerts (i.e. email) that warn of massive shifts in walls (a.k.a. depth charts) in exchanges that you have an active order in. For example, if you had a massive buy wall underneath you that you were depending upon for security, it's nice to know when/if that wall dissapears. 
* Triggered Events: I'm sure there are some effective trading bots out there, and while I have my ambitions, I know I need to take things one step at a time. The first step in this direction is to implement simple triggered events. For example, "Place a [Buy/Sell] order for [X] quantity of [Currency0] at an offer of [Y] quantity of [Currency1] when [Currency2] experiences [Operation]."
* Support for all exchanges which offer an API. This is pretty high on the priority list. To piggyback off that notion, trading across exchanges would be nice...

But my lazy bones!!! For motivational purposes, I felt C# was the best language for rapid prototyping.
C++ is my favorite language, however, and I've been meaning to try out Qt, so a port in the future is definitely a possibility.

Pretty much the only way I could have any credibility is by making it open source.
