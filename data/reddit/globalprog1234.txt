I know a guy who invested in BTC back in 2008. Bought in at around $0.60(ish) cents. Sold it later for $8 and was angry at himself when BTC went to $36.  
If only he would have HODLed to 2017, his BTC would have been worth a cool $40 million.

It just feels wrong to sit on the sidelines knowing a scam is about to be unfolded and seeing how everyone will lose their shirts even though the market is not doing well now. I think once the scam is exposed BTC falls to around $2000.
Is there anything investors can do though to stop Tether before the mainstream media gets ahold of the scam news? Something we can do so markets don't collapse when they hear the news?

But Tether today has a $2.2 Billion market cap. How would it collapse a $400 Billion market? Besides it's no secret that Tether is running a scam and we all know that Tether's fake money printing drove BTC to overinflated high of $20K. We all know $20k is not the real value of BTC.
Besides, look at reviews for Bitfinex, a quick Google search will show you it's a fraud and scam itself. If Bitfinex is a fraud then Tether must be one too.
Plus the crypto media prints articles on fear of Tether being a fraud and collapse so isn't this Tether situation already priced into the market? That way when CFTC finally concludes they're a fraud it's not like we'll be shocked.
Of course I believe the market will collapse but a short term collapse. I think it'll be a good buying opportunity like the 2008 recession for the stock market was a good buying opportunity. This will be our financial crisis.

I really hope you're incorrect. There are so many great coins out there that are trying to solve read world problems that can really benefit society as a whole in the long run.  I wouldn't want them to just die off because Tether is a scam and the market gets shaken up. However, since we all practically know Tether is a scam and so is Bitfinex and in crypto news almost everyday articles are being written spreading FUD regarding Tether scam, isn't this fear already priced into the market?
We know the real value of BTC is not $20k and that Tether with it's fake money printed pushed up prices. But we know it.
Why would a $2.2 Billion market cap Tether be able to collapse a $400 Billion dollar market all on its own?

Is there a coin for Lightening (if not, when'll it ICO, if not, will it ever be a coin?) like there's a token for Raiden?

That's not true, the Mt Gox lawyers sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of BTC on the open exchange that's one of the big reasons we had such massive swings earlier this year in the fall of crypto.

I don't short. I trade to the upside only. It's either way to me. If the market goes up, I'm happy to ride the wave and if it goes down, i'm happy to buy more coins for cheaper prices. I say this because in the long term, I see crypto market in a huge bull run.

I bet shorts are coming back into the market, BTC can't continue without some kind of retracement.  The RSI shows BTC is completely overbought, MACD shows bullishness is fading and volume in bullish zone is declining. Plus there hasn't been any major selling in 4 days. So I'm thinking we can fall to $7500 BTC soon so I bet the shorts are gearing up.
Gives us an opportunity to buy in your favorite coins at better prices.

Manipulation is what we saw today a $1500 move in a matter of 30 minutes. Nothing but a few whales trying to shake the shorts. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:11:30
Ofcourse they sold, but you don't have to think so, think what you want.
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:51:40
I agree especially since I hodl'd all throughout 2017 and sold in January 2018. I wonder why people say hodl'ers are stupid, I made a killing and so did every Hodl'er in 2017. I guess we're still stupid!?!?
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:46:01
Didn't that same guy buy the first pizza with BTC via the lightening network as well?
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:54:13
You're probably correct but where do you get this info, where you particularly see that number $150 M?
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:50:26
No, nothing to do with shorts covering. More like a few whales manipulating the market to shake the shorts. I think until about 4/17 we're still poised to see some selling especially since there hasn't been any real selling since 4/9. I'm still expecting 6k, it's still possible before we go back up late next week into a possible true bull market.
