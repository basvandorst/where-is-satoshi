This is what ultimately calms me. pick a market and their GDP. I live in the states, without a doubt our fiat currency is going to fail soon, now the most ardent bitcoin haters like peter schiff still agree on this that fiat is dying. Now perhaps peter will be right and we'll go back to a gold standard. But if we don't its more important on how much bitcoin you own compared to how much is available 16.7M right now. WHEN we go weimar republic in the states, that's 20T worth of trade that can be added to the current $200B market cap of BTC. That alone will make 1 BTC worth $1.2M a coin... And when America sneezes, the entire world gets a cold, world GDP is around $200T hows $12M per coin sound?
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:12:58
I hear this argument from people like peter schiff who's terrified that BTC will actually become digital gold. There is inherent value in BTC in that it's NOT the US Dollar which is getting inflated to the tune of $20B a month. and currently it has a greater ease of use than gold or equal too if you consider things like goldmoney Schiffs project. But gold is always just a stay of value, it only rises relative to the inverse of inflation. meaning whatever you are comparing it to dollar wise is losing, aka the dollar is losing value. The difference with bitcoin is that not everyone in the world recognizes the value of BTC. 
Currently everyone in the world recognizes the value of gold. if someone were to offer you an ounce of gold for $1000 dollars and they had the proper information every one would take it (because they'd make $200 instantly). BTC however (at the time of this post is 13.5k) if you offered someone 1 BTC for $10,000 most of the world would tell you to fuck off.
To clarify more specifically gold is already priced at the market cap of the entire world economy (minus keynesian on debt, so realistically gold could potentially triple in value IF the entire world went back to a gold standard) BTC is measured at a $230B market cap, it's impossible to say exactly but the world market cap is somewhere in the 100T-1 Quadrillion range with all sorts of factors going into that.  what that means is if say the low end of 100T is the total market economy, well divide that by 230B and that IF the world adopted BTC as the world currency whatever you own now in BTC multiply it by 434, and that's what you can potentially be worth in a decade or so.

i'm not saying bitcoin won't be worth the purchasing power of even million dollars in today's terms, but when currencies are hyperinflating no bitcoiner is going to cash out into fiat because no one wants fiat. there won't be a conversion rate. At that point in time the only people who would be using fiat are government workers and those on the welfare system. And they'll only be able to use it among themselves.
@_date: 2018-09-23 02:06:40
he's an asshole and I'll explain why. We all kind of understand what money is it's a ledger for goods or services provided. Now we all know the problems with fiat contorting what money should be but the fact of the matter is with fiat there is less actual goods and services being provided that fiat GDP, hence inflation. The reason I bring this up is that at that market cap level there's hyperinflation that's a roughly 5T market cap for just bitcoin alone even if all the alts went to zero that still means that we're experiencing inflation levels that anyone who's competent enough to hold bitcoin wouldn't be trading their bitcoin for fiat. At this price point and I'd argue anything over 100k bitcoin holders will not trade for fiat at that point they'll trade their BTC directly for goods or services.

I don't want to be a downer here and I am a BTC maximalist. But I don't see the point in being paid in BTC unless you are literally trying to skirt taxes and aren't paid by a formal employer. In my humble opinion it's better to DCA each month at peak lows. right now btc is just a store of value, based on the knowledge that fiat is going to hyperinflate. but we're not hyperinflating right now and you still have to transact in fiat. You're not bucking the system by transacting in BTC if anything you're just clogging the blocks. You're also not really sharing the knowledge all of this gets converted you're not forcing the employer to own BTC to pay you in it and I do believe that time will come but it is not now.  
But I'd love to be corrected on this.

which is why I don't think it will ever hit 1 million dollars because no one will want to trade it for fiat at that point. This is unless by a miracle which I believe to be mathematically impossible the US keeps kicking the dollar can down the road while the rest of the world adopts bitcoin. then it could be theoretically measured in a Million USD. That said I do believe there will be a point in our near future where it will be worth a million dollars of purchasing power in 2018

I love the sentiment of this post specifically for the memeage. But there is something very bullish and very serious to be taken from this. You're not buying Bitcoin from Hodlers today, well that's not entirely true we have been buying from Hodlers who bought when it was dirt cheap and have so much their time preference has allowed them to enjoy some fruits for their patience. You're mainly buying from miners, and that's the fantastical part about this, we've been stagnating around this mid six mark for months, all the early hodlers are flush and still hodling their reserves, yet there is still demand for $12M a day of newly mined bitcoin. In 2020 the supply will half and realistically with more adoption demand will increase. That alone guarantees in less than 2 years from now you are earning 50% annual rates of return. But what excites me most is that bitcoin was created as a hedge against global financial crises which it has yet to experience. In the United States we have $210T in unfunded liabilities, once those liabilities need to start cashing checks that's when we'll see hyperbitcoinization.
@_date: 2018-08-19 03:53:29
this bitcoin hasn't lived through a global recession yet which is what it was created for. All TA goes out the window when that happens and I see that right around the corner especially with baby boomers exiting the workforce in the united states there's 210T in unfunded liabilities. But here's the real problem the real estate market tried to correct itself in 08, and was bailed out prices are back up to those highs yet the average wages of those entering the house buying market are 2/3rds (adjusted for inflation) of boomers when they entered. For boomers who didn't save social security is not going to cut it for them not to mention the fact that social security isn't funded. They'll start selling off their real estate assets to make end's meat and because the average income of new consumers is so low they'll have to underbid their real estate which will cause the banks to become insolvent because all of a sudden their asset value will drop even if they foreclosed and tried to resell the house they wouldn't cover losses. This time when the government tries to bail them out people will have an alternative.   
My prediction is that if this event happens before the end of 2020 John McAfee will not be dining on his genitals, however if it happens after John will definitely being eating dong.

are you referring to the 1971 removal of the dollar to the gold standard? if so yes I'm very aware. Also aware of increasing M1 from 1T to 4T in the last decade.
What I'm explocity saying is that even though bitcoin's value has increased by percentages off the charts, all it would of had to do to be a better store of value was 4x'd over the last decade. Which means as long as it holds an annual return of 40% and I don't mean that literally year by year but for it too be long term at least 5 years. But what that means is if you're putting away money right now you will actually be able to purchase more labor in the future than you had to put in in the past, which is remarkably demonstrating it can do.

as I said fully aware there is zero chance of BTC being 1M/BTC just based on adoption.  All the people who understand austrian economics are already fully invested and we've burned the people in it for FOMO.

@_date: 2018-08-22 03:24:42
I agree with you unless external economic factors FORCE people to understand the technology, you know something like another round of quantitative easing on the world reserve currency. Why you might ask would that happen? maybe the 210T in unfunded liabilities, a hefty portion of which being pensions and the boomers have only been retiring for 2 years, they also own the most real estate value. If they're pensions and social security don't give them the purchasing power needed to pay their bills and they're too old to participate in the workforce they'll be forced to sell off their assets, and the generation entering the housing market can't afford these prices millennial average income is 40k. They'll have to underbid each other just to sell to those without houses, which will kill the banks same as happened in 08 what bitcoin was created to combat. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 02:41:49
I understand your point and I stand to become quite wealthy if BTC just becomes the currency for the US. But I'm a conservative risk averse. I view BTC as a very likely thing of becoming a new gold standard, but it's not 100%. I would give up that wealth to bring sureness up to 100%, mainly because I know that in that world of finite money I could still become rich, and I'd enjoy the added benefit of other's not as keen on the current monetary problem. Make no mistake all us people in this space "going to the moon" every elderly person (and some might argue they deserve it for their naivety and voting in the past (boomers) and how they benefited from it) but they will all suffer terribly, they're too old to participate in a workforce and all their houses will drop in value and their pensions will dry up. BTC going to the moon is a bittersweet pill to take. Yes long run it will be better for everyone, but it won't be pretty in the interim.
@_date: 2018-08-19 04:57:59

people will really only hodl until there's massive adoption, because ultimately there's nothing more scarce on this earth than your time there is a point in every human and age is definitely a factor, where there's a tipping point for the increasing value of bitcoin and the time they have left on this earth to enjoy it. The reason everyone is HODLing now (and the people who got in at less than $100 rightfully sold off a portion during the peak) is because they recognize its potential for growth is well worth the delay of their gratification. guarantee the next 10x from here there's another sell off. That's life changing amounts of money 10x means a lot of people who literally just got into btc today can retire. The only way I see this not happening is if all fiat is in hyperinflation and then they're merely delaying gratification for a couple of days or weeks until it reaches total global market cap.  
Ask yourself this: say you own 1 BTC and with BTC being the world reserve currency that means 1 BTC will equal 20M+ per coin. When it hits 1M you're not going to sell off even a small portion to buy something for yourself?

with total retail adoption (and we'll both acknowledge we're talking purchasing power in the here and now) world GDP is over 100T how much productivity is stifled through government regulation and tax, and people on the dole who could be contributing to the workforce. Pierre Rochard thinks BTC could reach 100M/btc, I think that's a bit far fetched but at that point it will be impossible to prove. I think realistically we could take total GDP multiply it by 1+ the average tax rate for certain and add 35%. then the play with wiggle room I'd say we'd double world GDP so about 200T. and I'm going to use the 21M despite the lost bitcoins because by then I think we'll figure a way to redistribute them back into the system. that puts it at about a 9.5M per BTC
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:28:10
you know in the past 10 years the US inflated it's money supply 4x so actually stocks have gone down in purchasing power. Government bonds pay less than the government's stated rate of inflation. even gold's price over the last 10 years hasn't even double so it to loses purchasing power over time, bitcoin well if we're talking a 10 year time frame, obviously nothing compares. Let's see what happens this next recession.

fully aware of the site I think John is a lunatic, BUT because he won't release his metric I won't fault him. If he thinks we'll reach that market cap through adoption simply because of past performance he's a moron, but if his metric is more sophisticated something I can't even mathematically compute but based off external events forcing people into bitcoin he may be a genius.

I think one of the best edges bitcoin has over gold is that both can have second layers solutions to make its use easier and cheaper. However bitcoin has the advantage of being infinitely cheaper to secure on your own without the overhead of physical security meaning real estate and personnel as well as transportation. That's why if some company or entity wants to fractional reserve or exploit their second layer they'll go bankrupt and won't be able to be bailed out.

this. Unfortunately I think the 4th option is what is going to force people into bitcoin. Just like in venezuela most people need harder levels of inflation to realize there's a problem with their money. Those ahead of the curve are already versed in Austrian econ and have been shouting at the top of their lungs forever, only certain people listen. Some are even incentivized not to listen think those about to retire which want their social security pensions 401ks and real estate to keep going up in value. Anyone close to the cantillon effect does not want bitcoin to succeed. It's those at the last end of the cantillon effect who need to be shaken awake and this next debt crisis should do just the trick.

this is merely an opinion: fractional reserve is a form of inflation, but in practice it is finite, because there's a point where bank runs would happen, we saw this in the great depression. Now without the centralization of the base money there'd be no way to bail out these fractional reserve banks and then users would learn not to invest in fractional reserve banks. Without a doubt Bitcoin will need second potentially third layer solutions, because of the transaction cap on the base layer, in this way bitcoin is similar to gold's faulty attributes. However the one thing bitcoin has is that for large wealth it is them cheaper and faster to store your bitcoin not in a bank or second layer solution, but in your own wallet and transact on the blockchain.
Picture this even now we're back on a gold standard. If amazon has to physically ship physical gold to all the people it pays and buys from it'd be a nightmare they'd have to double their shipping infrastructure and put security on it because they're shipping unprotected money. So even they would have to centralize their gold in order to do business. With bitcoin large institutions can centralize their own accounting payroll, etc. then batch one transaction on the blockchain to a second layer intermediary and it's final settlement in 40 minutes. They also don't need to pay for the banks infrastructure to pay people and real estate to protect physical gold. Because the mass amounts of bitcoin wealth won't be on second layer and third layer solutions; if those 2nd and 3rd layer entities go about inflating supply they will very quickly get bust and because the majority of wealth will still be on chain there won't be fiat to bail them out.  
I want to edit this to make the concept more rudimentary. I'm going to use some arbitrary numbers:  
\&gt;ACME corp is worth 100 BTC has many employees   
\&gt;ACME corp hires a second layer "bank" to have its customers send their btc to (granted there are 1000s of these second layer "banks" that customers use, AND its the same "banks" they receive their paychecks in)  
\&gt;weekly said second layer "bank" notifies ACME of its revenue for the week. ACME notifies "bank" of its employee payroll.  
\&gt;2nd layer "bank" says you've received 10BTC in consumer purchases, ACME tells "bank" we have 5 BTC in payroll "here are the recipients and their prospective paychecks"  
\&gt;2nd layer "bank" puts a 5BTC transaction on the base layer blockchain to ACME and then with the remaining 5BTC it has from consumer purchases on the second layer pays said employees.  
meanwhile there's still 105 BTC on the base layer of bitcoin held by ACME corp, if said bank starts giving them problems with payroll or revenue switch banks.
@_date: 2018-10-23 03:20:25
that would ruin gold's value by increasing it's supply. Saifedean talks about this, right now gold is a harder money than bitcoin because of the increase in gold supply is smaller than the increase in bitcoin supply, next halvening bitcoin becomes the harder money. But even disregarding that, bitcoin right now has one thing going for it gold does not. Gold in today's global economy has to be centralized, which means it can not be a good money because we all know when it's centralized governments seize control of it and implement fiat, but even without governments banks still can inflate it with fractional reserve banking. FRB isn't infinite in its inflation however because if they hold too low a reserve bank runs happen. But make no mistake when there's centralization mandated banks or other entities will inflate the the supply at least 7x via fractional reserve. That's the beauty of bitcoin is large wealth holders do not need to pay astronomical expenses to physically secure and transport their wealth, the small wealth holders will have to centralize but given that it is against the best interests of big players to decentralize it protects the small wealth holders.  
In my opinion there's two ways this plays out. Over decades BTC proves to be a better store of value and gradually takes gold's market cap. Or we have a collapse of the US dollar and Bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency.
@_date: 2018-10-16 23:47:52
you're entirely wrong it is the exact definition of inflation the only reason our prices haven't gone up by 4  times is because of increased labor and technological advancements making products more efficient and cheaper. Prices have still gone up but not by 4 times, without the money supply increase somethings today would be cheaper than they were in 08 because of that same technological advances. fuck off you keynesian.
@_date: 2018-10-28 03:28:34
The other thing I forgot to add in about fractional reserve banking with gold as opposed to BTC, is because BTC final settlement is so much quicker to secure. the 14% fractional reserve that seems to work for at least a decade or so with gold might not be enough with BTC. With gold the phsyical gold rarely ever actually gets moved in fact most banks IIRC don't even hold gold anymore they rely on the central bank to hold it for them, which is complete centralization which is how you can avoid bank runs because each night the Central bank can give banks who over lent instant digital funds especially since most people don't withdraw cash. With bitcoin if people want their bitcoin you have to deliver it and there's no central bitcoin bank to wire you funds daily.

if you want a serious answer [  
one of the main downfalls of gold is that in a global economy we need to move money long distances and we also have to move money fast. This is the reason banks were invented in the first place is so that you didn't physically have to move gold for every single transaction. We all know how then it was possible to deviate from the gold standard.

Now if there's was just a brinks truck that crashed off a bridge and the road is laden with hundreds and you're the only one around, do you pick up the the money despite your bum back?
Our time on this earth is finite which is obviously a given, there's a reason 40hrs is generally the full time work week, now some people work more some less depending on how they're compensated, But you won't find many people willing to work 112hr+ work weeks no matter the price they're being paid for a lengthy amount of time. As your free time diminishes the wage that you'll accept to further shrink your free time increases, this is why we have things like overtime pay. Not only because the less free time you have the more expenses you accrue, for example if you work 70hr weeks you likely have to pay a landscaper to mow your lawn, you likely have to eat out rather than cook your own meals. But also there's intangible costs. working that much means you likely aren't getting much hanky panky time with your significant other, what's the hrly cost of a high end escort who still won't satisfy you as much as someone you truly love, something like $500 an hr, that's what people are demanding when their time becomes so finite they have to give up sex.

There's nothing wrong with being a long term HODLer, but there will come a point when you think the bitcoin you have is fairly valued and you will spend it. It might not even be at peak bitcoin value. I don't know when you put in your $300 but say it was now with the price being $6300/BTC. giving you .047BTC current global GDP is around 100T, now in a bitcoin world that might go up because government and regulations would shrink making the market more efficient but just taking that number as total market cap your $300 now potentially only will equal about $225k in today's value of a dollar. Between now and that time you're job may improve and you might start earning near 100k a year (again talking today's value of the dollar cause its going downhill from here) perhaps when your .047 BTC equals about 100g its not worth it for you to wait another 5 years or so for it to double and you determine, fuck it I'm going to straight up buy a house no mortgage with your BTC and fiat holdings. Boom you just lost all your BTC gained a tangible good and now the previous homeowner gets to determine if they want to HODL some more or spend it on a new boat, car, whatever...

It might start with the most corrupt inflators getting collapsed because of the middle class in those countries only trading labor and goods in bitcoin. You could be a multi USD billionaire but if no one will do commerce with you, what does that wealth mean? One person alone especially a rich man cannot build a skyscraper without the middle class he needs those tradesmen. before you know it places like egypt bankrupt their government and operate solely on bitcoin which can't fund a large government, and then they have the comparative advantage america had in the 18th and 19th centuries, where they could underbid every other nation because they had lower overhead. more and more countries opt in raise the market cap and then america can no longer compete and america has $20T to add to this market cap, maybe more if we wipe out our bloated government. divide 20T by the number of bitcoins available and John McAfee starts looking much more stable than we all thought.

its not a trend its ponzi. literally everything besides bitcoin is a ponzi scheme. The blockchain is not efficient for anything other than a currency, and it's not even efficient as a currency when there's only one. If fiat was honest it'd beat out bitcoin. People pay for the inefficiency of bitcoin because its finite nature is still more cost effective than the ways governments utilize fiat. Creating more of them is just like governments printing money. None of them will bitcoin because its self\-destructing because then the people who simply wanted a real faith in something that will not devolve in value who be hoodwinked because the currency is ever moving to the new better one. This is why the first mover advantage holds so much sway for BTC.   
But btw I'm not against anyone trying to make short term gains in these alt coins. I fully recognize that the best short term gains are actually NOT in BTC. But if we're talking long term you better know when the fuck to get out of the alts and back into bitcoin.

on a theoretical level of understanding with a sound money you would be correct. But the whole reason bitcoin exists is because boomers wanted social services healthcare benefits pensions  real estate and equities without paying the taxes for them so nixon closed the gold window to pay for them via inflation and debt (soon-to-be-realized-inflation) there are boomers who despite being home owners for 40 years still have a mortgage. They think their pensions social security and cash saved is going to cover their retirement, but if the US Dollar became honest tomorrow all those things would dump. Any boomer who was pissed off about what their government was doing is probably open to investing in BTC.

I love trump for everything outside of his fiscal issues, but a conservative first and foremost is about small government. As far as Trump's legacy thus far he's only grown the government. Tax cuts without a reduction in spending is still a tax. It's a future promise to increase the money supply to pay for it. The only way to defend Trump is to impose on to Trump that he is preparing the US in the softest way possible to meet this collapse, by getting as many people as possible not dependant on government subsidies before the crash happens. I don't see his solution for the elderly though, those public pensions medicare and social security are going to zero.

You can't claim to be a conservative and grow the state. Conservatives are first and foremost about small government, their social stances and issues are merely guidelines on how to act when you have a small government with no safety nets. There's a reason conservatives tend to be religious, because without the welfare state your church is your discriminatory welfare, they won't give you charity if you're a drunk, but if you really need help there's where you go. There's a reason conservatives push stigmas on unchaste women, because if you don't pick the right partner to have kids with there's no state funded welfare to take care of you.

Listen I'm not going to defend coinbase per se because the much more informed crypto guys know how to better purchase it. I am not one of those people but because I am not I use coinbase I am trying to figure out everything I need to to absolutely ensure I have total possession of my bitcoins, but in the interim I'm going to rely on them until I figure it out 100%. Coinbase is somewhat (for lack of a better word) gay in the fact that when you buy they add 60 dollars to the spot you're buying in at and they still charge you a transaction fee (albeit small now), and if you want to cash into fiat they do both of those again. Though from my understanding you could transfer to gdax and cash out there free of TX. That said I've never had a problem with coinbase besides the aforementioned things and I knew those things and paid the premium for my lack of expertise. I use chase for fiat banking. 
If you are looking into swing trading to accumulate more bitcoin though get on binance, so you can sell your bitcoin for tether and not have to risk capital gains taxes. The reason I mention this is because we're years away from bitcoin losing it's volatility and while it's volatile that means there's money to be made selling off when its too
 high to buy in when it corrects, but if those gains are subject to tax, couple that with human error and it may errode your stake. The purpose of tether is to act as fiat while not being it. so for instance looking back at december if you sold all your bitcoin for tether at 20k and then sold your tether for BTC when BTC was 6k you could have made a lot of BTC, but never had to pay any taxes, because you didn't cash out into fiat.

I am not here to shit on your parade in fact the opposite. What people really want to know is their purchasing power. using the market cap/coin supply= value of the coin is underselling it ALOT! There will be a point where it will be impossible to value bitcoin in US dollars because no one will sell BTC for USD. So what people want to know is what will the potential "PURCHASING POWER" of 1 Bitcoin be with a bitcoin global reserve standard, and generally they want that compared to right now what they understand a certain amount of US dollars can buy. Technically we only have about 4T in m1 money supply in  USD. Yet the US has 22T in annual GDP. I understand GDP is not market cap. But because of how easy the US Dollar is as a money and our ability to have unfunded liabilities in the 210T dollar range we can essentially not just in banks fraction reserve our currency banks by merely only retaining 10% reserves inflate the money supply by 10x. When custodians actually have to have physical custody of their money at 100% you'll find that businesses with unsustainable models go insolvent infinitely quicker. I mean this is very complex stuff which I'm not even qualified to talk on (with the exception of the fractional reserve part that I am, so just use that part) So at the very least you have to 10x your number since it is very unlikely bitcoin can be fractional reserved because large wealth will always be mainly stored on the blockchain rather than in 2nd layer banks. Then we have to calculate which is impossible or central planning would work, but we know on a bitcoin standard governments would not be as large as they are which would reduce regulations taxes and people dependent on the state which would drastically increase productivity making things cheaper therefor getting even more for your buck. Most people would say with hyperbitcoinization you're looking at a $6-10M bitcoin, I'd say conservatively you'd have to double that generously you 10x it. granted we're talking 2k18 purchasing power of the US dollar. and I think for the 10x (60-100M) you'd need at least an entire generation living under the bitcoin standard. so earliest that'd be 2060. look at gold compared to world GDP, no one is on a gold standard, some governments still hold it as a backup, but gold pays a premium in that only a minute section of retail value it as a hedge against inflation yet it still holds an 8T market cap. Couple that with my same principles, 10x of fractional reserve banking and how much smaller governments would be under the gold standard again and you can easily put gold market cap at way above $150T.

yes it does. Money is a finite measure of total human productivity, aka human time/labor, to gain that market cap means it has to take from other forms of money. The nominal values of the fiat currencies might change to make it seem like it's not a zero sum game but their purchasing power will fall. If I'm charging BTC for 8 hrs of my labor to fix a muffler, there still needs to be a conversion rate for someone fixing a muffler in fiat, same amount of time and expertise being constant.

Here's something I want people to understand, first off I'm a perma long term bitcoin bull. But when we get into the 300k BTC price there needs to be context. that's a 6.3T marketcap. Money as most of you know is simply a measure of human productivity, strictly human productivity, yes technology can make productivity more efficient but it's relative, we get more of a good for the same labor but that means it will get cheaper, you're demanding someone's finite time on this earth when you accept money because you have the implicit intention to trade it to someone for their time. So given all that we're not going to increase the "money" in the world by much, sure with no governments it will force some people not working to work that will net lower costs though.   
So when we're approaching market caps like $6.3T we're not getting there without one of a few scenarios or all at once. Perhaps at a 6.3T marketcap we take all the marketcap from gold less it's conductive properties in electronics, everything else staying the same. Perhaps the Euro goes to complete shit and all of europe adopts BTC as their currency, with the USD doing it's thing just like now, though that's a slippery slope because it then no longer has petrodollar reserve status. Or you have the US Dollar hyperinflating which means there is no $300k price point for bitcoin, because the point where it would be valued in today's terms of purchasing power it skips to $600k and the same time no one who owns BTC would dare trade their BTC for US Dollars knowing they could lose half their purchasing power in a day. What I'm saying is the $300k range is likely the point where bitcoin becomes a unit of account.

he actually started off as a bitcoin hater. check out his youtube on bitcoin austria about his book, the Q&amp;A is perhaps even better than the presentation (skip to 4:33 to bypass the German) [  
As far as the understanding I've come to on my own even if bitcoin was merely comparable to gold which it isn't because you have to centralize gold for all size payments, and its true small payments in bitcoin will be centralized but large will stay decentralized. This is a war on baby boomers, baby boomers voted for expansion of government received jobs services and benefits without raising their taxes, instead they deferred that tax to the gen Xers and millennials we now through inflation are paying their tax while they received assets via the cantillon effect. So it has to be bitcoin in order for the productive generations those actually participating in the workforce to work and trade in a currency the Boomers do not own, so that they have to sell off their remaining assets for our currency. I know it seems harsh but if you compare it to what those boomers did to the young generations it's merely just I have another 2 minute clip you should watch explaining this but I'll link it in a reply since I've already shared a video.

old people don't like bitcoin because on some level they understand that all the things they were promised without paying for through increased taxes but instead unsustainable debt, will dry up under a bitcoin standard. Their pensions will go to shit, they won't have medicare, and because health insurance works that you have to pay in while you're healthy and young to subsidize your healthcare needs when you are old and more sickly, with a switched monetary standard they will have not paid into the system so their healthcare will be at a premium. And they're real estate will be the last asset they have to offer to sell to the now working generations, and because they had too few kids, they will have to underbid each other to offload the real estate to meet low demand with high supply. All while being to old to participate in the workforce to earn this new money. And I find it perfectly fitting, given what boomers were given via jobs education leaving the gold standard to fund it, but using debt to make sure they won't pay for it, but the younger generations will. They better hope they were good to their kids.

don't forget peter schiff. As right as the guy is on the looming fiat collapse, he's wrong AF about BTC. That said I won't even call him biased... just out of touch. If you are a megalamillionare yes buying gold is the safest store of value. But the problem is most of the world doesn't have savings they can put in a cryogenic freezing chamber to weather the storm. Why would I stash 4 thousand dollars of monopoly money into an asset that will still only buy 4 thousand dollars worth of shit when the fiat collapse happens. If I was that paranoid nonperishable food and ammo would serve me better. Not to mention we had our currency backed by gold and saw how easy it was for governments to remove the bank notes from that standard. How many of you are going to walk around with a scale and chisel shaving off milligrams of your gold bullion to pay for everyday goods? oh but there's goldmoney.com. ok sounds just like banks circa 1913, then the federal reserve comes in. 
If I had 10M liquid even with how invested I am in Bitcoin, I'd still allocate 99% of it into precious metals, because even if BTC took over I put 100k into it which currently is 10 BTC and if BTC took over the entire... nay just the US economy ($20T) I'd have $13.3M in BTC plus 7615 ounces of gold.

For the record I'm trying to shit on Tesla I think without government funding they would eventually be their own thing and you'd have people who understand the tech being owners and lenders to it.

well here's the paradox about bitcoin. In a way whales and early adopters even potential hackers, have a disadvantage in hoarding it, or stealing a significant portion of it. Say coinbase were to get hacked  and someone stole all the BTC on coinbase. Instantly the value that that hacker stole just dumped, if someone takes it all everyone else will lose faith in the currency and won't accept it. 
The same can be said if a small minority holds something like a million coins. If they hold their coins without spending them or spend them in reckless ways they ruin the value of the currency thus ruining their own wealth. There's a point where this grows so big that it sustains itself. Those who hold large amounts of bitcoin will have to spend it to employ people and get other people wealthy or they will have to make poor spending and basically give it away or its like shrinking the 21M cap making the currency more valuable to others.

Would be nice to get viewership to libertarians. The only reason I found out about the purpose of bitcoin was talking to Anarchist Mike Malice. I had heard of bitcoin before but didn't understand its purpose or true potential.

one world currency is fine IF it is in fact real money like BTC or gold. The only problem with globalization is that implies central control of money. A true free market and comparative advantage are wonderful things. If some honger can codemonkey better than I can but I can lets say design fashion better than he can I can buy his labor for software benefits cheap while selling my services for fashion at a premium. I need his good and he needs mine. (for the record i have zero artistic value in myself this is making a point) 
If the slant wanted to make clothes say he possessed the raw ability but it would take him twice the time to figure it out, he and I could meet in the middle at 1.5, he gets a product that would have taken him say 16 hrs to make I did it in 8 and sold it for 12. When I need code done he does it in 8 I would do it in 16 and he sells for 12. we both have 12 units yet only spent 8 units

I know reddit is cancerous as witnessed by the comments in this post, but as usual with the internet only the squeaky wheels feel the need to post cause they want grease. yet this post is still upvoted to number 4 or so on the main page, case in point. I do actually like your article, and I think your number 6 reason dwarfs all of them. I follow the austrian school of economics (AS DID SATOSHI YOU FUCKING MORONS), but even I'll admit it's hard to convey that to people if it was easy our fiat system would not be so corrupt because there'd be pitchforks and torches in the streets demanding the heads of central bankers. This is merely a suggestion, you clearly have a better way with words than me, perhaps dedicate some of your time to studying austrian economics if you haven't already, and maybe with your skills you can articulate it better to the masses who were indoctrinated in keynesian economics, I majored in finance and it was amazing how much that crap was shoved down my throat. The mises institute is a free online university centered around this school of economics.

these are stupid, btc 500k mandates massive retail adoption you need half of the united states GDP added into the mix to reach 500k. you want to know when we moon, that's after the dollar collapse. THAT'S not saying the USD collapse won't happen in that time frame, but that's the indicator.
@_date: 2018-07-17 06:00:50
i'm a bull but I don't see a gradual trend line, external events will affect the next rise, we saw the retail speculation rise, institutional money will likely make another big one but the global retail and institutional one will come with the next economic downturn. Remember here with the price we're at right now for bitcoin to hit 100k or 1M it's practically the same thing, that means the market cap is bigger than most nations entire GDP. Which means those nations need to not be utilizing their fiat.

that depends if general knowledge about this space is there's really only one that can serve this purpose and the rest are just to dupe new people into pumping them, well then BTC's price will go up because people will know it's the only game in town. we need people to get burned. and they'll get burned when those with large stakes in other alts realize there's no more greater fools and convert to bitcoin and then as the price of that alt starts dropping there will be no liquidity for those left holding the bag to sell.

yes OP this is what you are looking for. I'll link a video that is basically a synopsis of this book given by the author of it. You should not be looking to anyone to tell you what or where to invest, you should be looking to someone to inform you properly so you can make your own decision. Most importantly about the bitcoin standard is that it's not mainly about bitcoin. It explains bitcoin some, but explains the world economy better which after you gain that understanding will naturally be pushed towards bitcoin or perhaps gold if you are more risk averse. (skip to 4:33 to skip the german, and watch the Q&amp;A its equally informative) [

I fail to see you logic here. You lend me lets say .1 BTC what did you do to earn that .1BTC? let's say for example you worked for 40 hrs. well you want your 10% interest I guess I have to work for 44 hrs. It's that fucking simple stop thinking like a keynesian. Bitcoin is austrian money.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:59:36
Personally I think it would too, because there wouldn't be unneeded taxes or regulations which would spur growth, but at the same time you can't discount the amount of crony lobbyists who've added to that GDP through government handouts and regulations. it's merely a guesstimate. Tesla wouldn't be a thing without government handouts, that said they'd prolly come out on their own fruition down the line and more efficient

I too share your skepticism. It's actually easier to just buy on coinbase and likely more secure. I can understand an ETF for something where you don't want to actually have physical possession of something are are willing to crowdsource storage or trade of such thing. but when ownership of this thing is purely digital I fail to see how coinbase is not already for intents and purposes an ETF?

let me put it into perspective. it's very easy for a retail investors to throw in even a fifth of their annual earnings into bitcoin, because of its potential returns. at the 100k mark, they'd be throwing in a 50th of their earnings for a much smaller growth potential. This is why external factors will be mandated, the masses will be forced into bitcoin because of government money printing, no longer because of speculation. people can do simple math bitcoin tops out at 10M per coin with absolute total global adoption. (plus or minus the lack of gov regulations but also plus or minus keynesian economics puffing up global GDP) if its at 100k it only has the possibility for 100x but at that point people are making shit wages because we're in the recession and can only afford to dump in 1k annually. that gets them a .01 stake which right now me making median income can just stop buying drinks for a couple of days and buy. to get to and past 100k which I think will happen, you need global adoption.

it works like this: as some commenter said btc is difficult or impossible to fractional reserve. So debt will be real debt, say I have a lot of btc and yes say we're in a world of total bitcoin global reserve currency. I will still basically earn interest in terms of purchasing power by simply hodling, but when we have total adoption I'll only really gain in terms of the increased productivity and efficiency of the economy, for instance computers might stay the same price or even go down in price, but I'll getting a better computer the next year for simply waiting. So that difference right there will be the base interest rate, let's say that's 5%. Then you have to calculate default risk, if I have 50 BTC i'm earning 5% a year, but say some business comes along and they can make a 15% rate of return with more capital, well then I can find 100 of these companies and if 5 of them end up going bankrupt and default on the loan and there's no way to get the money back since it simply was spent there's no way to sue them it's simply gone I can charge 12.5% interest on those loans and make 2.5% more than merely HODLing and the successful companies can make 2.5% rates of return by taking on that debt.

check out caitlyn long on today's keiser report, she's trying to build a 100% reserve bitcoin bank. Yes it will be centralized but for most people not already in this space they need that. bag holders aka us will have so much wealth we'll be able to take the hit of TX fees on the chain.
@_date: 2018-12-24 01:50:17
BTC will rise in value because of efficiency in technology making the same product for less labor and or materials. (as I mentioned think computers getting cheaper or staying the same price but are now quicker have storage, etc...) As far as fractional reserve, BTC has final settlement within an hour, if someone were fractional reserving it'd be like bank runs every hour. Not to mention the majority of wealth will be held not in second layer solutions which will need to be utilized for normal person sized transactions, but say a giant company transferring all payroll weekly that will happen on chain. and if the majority of wealth is held on chain in their own wallets, then even if something 2nd layer like an exchange were to start fractional reserving it would get recognized with the transparency of the blockchain and people would put those bitcoin wallets at a discount, thus punishing bad users and then consumers would not use them.

I share the sentiment, I've only ever known a bear market and have been DCA'ing ever since last December. I first found out about bitcoin last August it took me a couple of months to first understand it (was a gold bug prior) I found buying at 12k to be a steal. I am very grateful for this bear market, if it lasts 3 years I would be happier than if it hit 100k by the end of year.
