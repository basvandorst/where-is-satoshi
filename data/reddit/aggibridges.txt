Some original content since the memes were getting pretty stale. Remember to stay cool and buy the dip, guys.

Nice sandals.

This is beautifully explained, thank you.

Friedman: Well, insider trading is illegal. There are people going to jail for insider trading and I think it has been a great mistake. You want more insider trading, not less. You want to give the people most likely to have knowledge about deficiencies of the company an incentive to make the public aware of that.
Caruso-Cabrera: By selling and hence driving down the stock price.
Friedman: Or by buying when it's the other way around.
The full quote for anyone wanting a quick answer to it.

This is really well done, do you have a portfolio we could take a look at?

I'm a newbie, could you explain why it's bad to keep your btc in an exchange? It seems like it's the most convenient way to keep it. Imagine btc price crashes, you could quickly sell it and then buy the dip, whereas if you had the bulk of your money in a hardware wallet, you'd have to wait until the transaction finalized and potentially lose money.

Reading about previous crashes makes me feel so much better. I was kicking myself over waiting so long to buy the dip, but now that it's at 7300 I feel marginally better for buying at 6300.

Hm, it's not dishonest if you're clear about it! You can just say "I'm keeping a copy of the password just in case you run into any issues" or however you want to phrase it. But I like your idea of a time lock even better!

I like this idea a lot. I'm a graphic designer, if anyone is willing, I can make you a nice little worthless certificate that says 0.13 BTC, and you can print it up in a nice card and give it away. Once people come to you asking why they don't actually have the money, you can give it to them.
Another option is to do this but keep a copy of the private key, in case they forget about it, you can just collect it back if they don't give a shit.

About that, I'm a graphic designer and I'd like to sell my services in bitcoin. The platforms I've found have all been super empty, though, is there a trustworthy site I can use to offer my services?
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:05:41
I understand, but why? What are the benefits/drawbacks?
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:40:27
You could crowdsource it and I'd contribute for that, it'd be hilarious.

I don't really understand a lot of what's going on with these tethers, is there a source you can give me to read up on your concerns? Thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:42:30
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-26 08:55:41
Well, what happened to that guy then?
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:10:17
 
It's your screen :)

There are a lot of Telegram bots that do a much better job than that for a whole variety of different coins.
