You might look into mining an altcoin such as ethereum and convert it into bitcoin since these coins use a different algorithm which is more pc-friendly.
You can also earn a few satoshi for free on faucets and mobile apps:

Just missed that last part, here's the original post: 
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:18:56
Any exchanges that have implemented transaction batching?
@_date: 2015-12-05 10:41:38
Sounds like a perfectly good idea to me.
It doesn't make sense that any country can make laws against something that is perfectly legal or has significantly milder sentence elsewhere, and then demand people extradited.
I think people should only have to obey the laws of the country they are currently in, and possibly also where their legal residency is.
Otherwise you could have very religious countries demand extradition and lengthy prison sentences because of what anyone says on twitter f.ex.
@_date: 2017-02-27 19:09:53
other than being a softfork and tested more, is the segwit solution better than flexible transactions in any way? FT sounds better, cleaner, more compact, upgradable. Thats the reason you may not want SW. A solution that will be part of the bitcoin code forever should perhaps be something that is clearly the best option. However i'd be happier getting something done than a continued stalemate.
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:57:01
Never increasing the on-chain transaction capacity will also lead to a death sentence.
@_date: 2017-02-25 08:44:25
Haha, interesting scenario.. you would have a bunch of core nodes filling their mempool to infinity without any confirmations ever being registered.
Meanwhile those same transactions would actually make it into the 2mb blocks just fine (enough miner and bu nodes attached to the network for that).
The miners confirm transactions and enforce the rules, so the rest of the network would become obsolete temporarily until they just accept 2mb blocks.
@_date: 2017-02-25 06:56:25
It would actually make a good statement that bitcoin is not run by a single team of developers. BU may have a good improvement proposal which could be accepted by miners and implemented, Core then needs to update their version and can continue with new improvement proposals which when agreed to are then implemented in BU and so on.
In this case the first bitcoin unlimited proposal is a hard fork which enable blocksize increase as a soft-fork in the future (follow longest chain regardless of blocksize), it makes sense both since the traffic congestion is the most important problem right now (it would relieve congestion quickly with no need for merchants, exchanges etc to update existing code) and it's extremely unlikely even with close to 100% of transactions on lightning or similar, that the on-chain capacity currently on offer by core is sufficient in the future. I would like to see discussion on why a hard fork is always unacceptable and too much of a risk. If a hardfork was executed by a 95% supermajority i don't see any hope for a 5% hashrate fork to survive (it would be almost a year with 200 minute block times until the next difficulty adjustment). Meanwhile there is significant risk right now of losing money due to unconfirmed transactions.
I think both sides should be happy if we got a hardfork segwit (the code could be made slightly cleaner and more efficient when not soft-forking) which included a 2mb blocksize and preferably also with a possibility of soft-forking to a higher blocksize in the future.
@_date: 2017-02-25 08:58:23
Blocking a capacity increase seems just as bad, either solution is a lot better than neither. A hardfork could accomplish both more cleanly, and i don't see why it wouldn't be safe if it had overwhelming support.
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:45:24
The expensive part of mining is asic mining hardware, not bandwith and hardrive storage.


Segwit could obviously be better with a hardfork, just look at the flexible transactions proposal f.ex which accomplishes everything segwit does with significantly less data per transaction. Perhaps core devs might be able to come up with something even better if they didn't limit themselves to soft fork.
Where do you get the 4mb throughput from? you would need specifically crafted spam in the whole block to get anywhere near that size. And what do you mean by data costs? how does a different type of signature change it?
@_date: 2017-02-25 08:52:42
Sure thanks :)
I'd be interested to hear more about why a hardfork should never be done. Core agreeing with a compromise hardfork sounds awesome to me, maybe we could get a cleaner version of segwit + 2mb base blocksize, which would allow more than twice as many lightning channels opening and closing etc.
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:06:59
That would be an extremely controversial hard fork.
Would be much more convinient if core just joined scaling to f.ex 4mb, then try to activate segwit without the controversial witness discount.
@_date: 2017-03-12 00:08:32
miners do the blockchain security, i don't mind pushing them towards what the users wants which is ultimately increasing bitcoin value in their interest, but the segwit weights are 4 to 1, which seems like more than they would be happy to comply with
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:52:42
Soft fork extension blocks might be an option, but HF could be preferable. I am very much aware of the risks.
Don't even need to discuss BU, as there is another almost 50% of miners that aren't signalling for segwit either.
Bigger blocks are more profitable for miners long-term, not short-term.
@_date: 2017-03-12 12:06:19
Should be possible to split into two future currencies at an exchange, the problem is you wouldn't be able to withdraw until after a fork occurs. would need to be a deadline where the forkcoins are converted back to btc somehow in case an upgrade to &gt;1mb blocks never happens.
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:54:19
Very surprised they got so many to agree on such a harsh statement. It basically just says they will all stick with Core's client and ignore nakamoto/hashrate consensus. Causing the value to drop quite a bit.
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:13:02
I don't see how you can read that any differently, unless you think "nodes" doesn't mean miners. In the very beginning practically everyone who used bitcoin was mining. And when Satoshi says "node" he's talking about someone who "vote with their CPU power", like we just quoted. Nodes who don't mine, don't vote, and won't build or secure the consensus chain.
@_date: 2017-03-31 15:32:45
When a block is rejected, the chain built on that block will be ignored by your client, so it only needs to be a single non-segwit block included in the chain on august 1st to fork off all bip148 clients.
Less than 30% of miners are signalling segwit readiness.
And they are not signalling bip148, so they will also mine new blocks on top of non-segwit blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:12:43
Mainly what will happen is transactions go dead slow with massive fee's on the old chain. f.ex if fork happens with a 75/25% split, then blocks will only be found roughly every 40 minutes, cutting the amount of transactions confirming to 1/4. If &gt;95% of remaining miners signal for segwit (unlikely), it still won't activate until after 1000 blocks, and the difficulty won't adjust down until after 2016 blocks. (2 months?)
More likely tho is that exchanges/market ignore BU and miners switch back to earn money, then the unlimited chain dissappears.
OR people/market figure that their transactions are actually confirming on the BU chain which is much better, and decide to switch to it. Rest of the miners and core follow and then we all have faster bitcoin with lower fee's.
OR core makes another hard fork to change PoW, and we then get 3 different kinds of Bitcoin which eventually boils down to 2 when the old chain dies. Which one keeps the name "Bitcoin" will be an intense battle.
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:07:53
Ridiculous, if there is no split away from whichever chain the latest version of core is running then the tokens are worth 0.
This means that if BU wins, and core updates to follow that chain, then the tokens are still worth 0.
Any split is unlikely to last, so the chance of there being a split on that specific date is extremely low, and even if there is, then bitfinex says they can delay settlement as long as they want and if anything changes such as core switching chain or catching up, then the value of bcu tokens are still 0.
Besides i thought bitfinex said they wouldn't list btc-u unless they fork away as an altcoin with replay protection, which is definitely not going to happen.
Best case scenario for bcu tokens is if core forks away from the original chain with PoW change or SW-UA(S/H)F, but even then, bitfinex might not consider them to exist because of replay attacks.
What they should do is give everyone back 0.5BTC per token if both clients are following the same chain at that time, OR at least specify BCU tokens to be equal to any HF &gt;1mb chain which contains more proof of work than the 1mb chain followed by a specified CURRENT version of core.
@_date: 2017-03-10 11:37:14
That was hypothetical, obviously. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:32:39
The other hidden economic agenda is why the Bitcoin Core development team does not want to scale on-chain.
Some of the main Core developers are hiding behind centralization and hardfork risks, while their real motive is to force transactions into sidechains by making on-chain transactions prohibitively expensive.
Is the lightning network really 100% free? will there never be any transaction fee's associated with it? I think there might well be some kind of fee which blockstream could profit from, but even if they are not, they have a strong economic incentive to showcase and push their sidechain technology.
So on one side you have blockstream blocking significant capacity increase to force sidechains, and on the other side you have miners blocking progress and bug-fixes to keep transactions on-chain where they can collect the fee's.
Users suffer, and we desperately need a compromise. Bitcoin needs both significant on-chain capacity increase AND sidechains.
@_date: 2017-03-13 00:34:50
Actually that's EXACTLY what the proposal says:
"While this BIP is active, all blocks must set the nVersion header top 3 bits to 001 together with bit field (1&lt;&lt;1) (according to the existing segwit deployment). Blocks that do not signal as required will be rejected."
@_date: 2017-03-26 04:54:47
Yeah i wonder why it's a weight rather than just a cap on witness data.
If you have 1mb of witness data, you actually lose 0,25mb of available legacy block data, making that part of the block even smaller than today.
Normal use with 100% segwit transactions still makes blocks around or less than 2mb, but miners are allowed to make 4mb spam blocks.
Why not just cap witness data at f.ex 2mb? Let miners decide the fee weight, allow more transactions per block, and limit attacks to 3mb instead of 4mb.
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:24:16
Sounds nice, but what is the problem were talking about exactly? it's less than 1/3 signalling for each of the two proposals, wouldn't it be settled by now if they were really centralized?
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:59:55
Yeah miners can set the witness fee rate at 1/2 instead of 1/4, but i find it very odd to be included at protocol level. They can make up to 4mb spam blocks, but not any bigger than that.
Why not just set the witness data cap at 1mb so you can have up to 2mb total segwit blocks, miners set market rate and we prevent 4mb spam blocks.
They are also missing an opportunity to prepare for larger blocks which will be needed in the future, they could include code for another signal that won't activate until a year or two from now, changing the cap to f.ex 4 or 8mb total with either data. It would of course need be a hardfork, but preparing this far in advance gives everyone more than enough time to prepare.
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:18:43
What BIP148 does is reject all non-segwit blocks from august 1st.
So as soon as any non-sw block is mined, which is perfectly valid for all current nodes and miners, then everyone who runs this code will be hardforked away from the network.
@_date: 2017-03-31 13:31:32
There should be some activation requirement tho, so it's not just a few nodes forking themselves off the network.
Preferably &gt;60% hashrate which would actually make it a soft fork rather than splitting the chain.
But at least make some kind of signal, perhaps &gt;90% of nodes signalling BIP148 before activation?
@_date: 2017-03-26 05:26:24
Why would it be hard for miners/clients to obey this rule? A cap sounds less complicated as a protocol rule than adding up the weights, and would come with the above benifits.
Only difference when constructing blocks is to stop before legacy &gt; 1mb OR witness &gt; 2mb. 2 variables instead of 1.
And should be an option for miners to adjust the fee weight either way, 75% witness discount can be the default option, but not imposed.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:07:32
Made an answer to a similiar question roughly a week ago, the original comment got deleted but my reply is still there:
Soft fork is when the rules get more strict, the blocks made by the upgraded version are compatible with older clients, and they only require at least &gt;51% of the hash rate to stay in consensus about the new upgrade.
Hard fork is when the rules loosen, the blocks made by the new version are incompatible with older clients, this require everyone to upgrade, or the chain/network splits.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:02:52
Good idea actually, clearly got &gt;50% hashrate from both sides combined, so if both sides are in on it we could start orphaning some undecided blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:49:49
BIP148 will immediately hard fork the chain on August 1st. It has to be the most risky and controversial proposal in the history of Bitcoin.
How much hashrate supports bip148 at the moment? 1%? Enjoy your block-less altcoin. I'd be surprised if that chain gets more than 2 blocks before it's abandoned.
Miners aren't stupid enough to actually run the code, they are just signalling to see if they can get others on-board, since it could work with &gt;50% of hashrate.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:33:29
There is a ton of other available solutions here. Core doesn't have to copy the exact mechanism of BU, it can f.ex be made to only follow the first time up to 2mb, which practically everyone except a few core developers seem to want anyway.
Then we can stay on the same chain for a good while longer and continue the discussion from there.
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:00:13
In a nutshell bitcoin is a chain of transactions which is put into blocks (the blockchain), each block have to match the bitcoin protocol rules to be allowed by the rest of the network, such as no double spending or stealing funds etc etc.
A big group of users and miners (miners are the ones generating new blocks) want to change one of these rules to allow bigger than 1mb blocks which is currently constraining the network, this group is mainly known as BU. This kind of upgrade would cause a hard fork which splits the blockchain into two different chains, followed by some clients and not others.
Another group wants to enforce a new rule (segwit), this can be done safely with a majority of miners enforcing the new rule, but will also fork the chain if enforced by a minority of miners (UASF)
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:40:27
Yeah that statement was incredibly harsh, clearly stating no support whatsoever for nakamoto consensus. And by the looks of it sent our moon rocket down in a spiral for now. Hopefully some other exchanges are more reasonable. It just needs to be split into two seperate coins while the fork lasts: btc-c and btc-u
Exchanges could implement code to automatically detect a fork pretty much immediately.
Receiving coins on each chain is easy, sending is more complicated, but they could just do withdrawal for both coins simultaneously until they manage to split some funds.
@_date: 2017-03-08 11:14:04
Now your obviously trolling, you can find the old source code and Satoshi's comments about it.
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:56:01
Well yeah, fiat has money printers which do abstain from printing.
If miners break the rules with a 51% attack, i am sure you'll hear about it without running a full node.
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:59:01
wait 200GB a month? that's nothing.. i tried to calculate and you'll only need a 1mbit connection for that (0,617 if i did it right)
A basic vps at about 20$ a month will easily give you 1-2TB of bandwith, so it sounds like to me that nodes wouldn't have much problem even with constantly full 8MB blocks (1,6TB transfer per month and/or 8mbit+ connection)
I don't understand the empty blocks thing at all, it's just as hard to mine an empty block as a huge one. (same amount of proof of work / hasing power) If they wanted to slow down the propagation of the block they mined, they could just not send it, there is nothing stopping a large mining pool from just withholding the block, mine the next one, then push both on the network at the same time to orphan a single block mined inbetween. The thing is you would need &gt;50% hashing power for this to be economically viable, otherwise other pools would just mine more blocks and orphan the one you are withholding most of the time. The same logic applies to pushing an oversized block through the network, if it's way too large and propagates slowly, then it's more likely to be orphaned.
Flexible transactions would support lightning network and could easily support Schnorr signatures, plus a new feature to lock-in a transaction, making it possible for most merchant to trust 0conf transactions again.
i agree that segwit is the most tested and ready to go right now, but it's annoying that it could and should be better, with less technical debt etc. Neither segwit or bu are great which is probably why most miners refuse to vote for either one, i think either of them would be a lot better than nothing, but wish there would be a better option/compromise with greater support.
@_date: 2017-02-25 08:12:44
Discussion seems a bit one sided without any actual arguments tho.. He said he would stick with 3% of hashrate against any hardfork. In that scenario blocks are only found once every 5-6 hours on average.
@_date: 2016-01-18 09:44:16
Maybe i am missing something too, but how about just pushing a stuck transaction by increasing the fee on a later transaction?
f.ex Bob has 1btc and sends 0.5btc to Alice with 0.5btc change back, he forgot to add a fee so the transaction doesn't confirm.
Couldn't now either Bob or Alice initiate a new transaction using either of their unconfirmed 0.5btc, and add a double fee to it. (f.ex 0.0002 when a regular fee is 0.0001) Couldn't a miner then include both transactions in the next block to claim the 0.0002?
This way the receiver of a unconfirmed transaction could also pay to get their money faster.
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:28:39
Core is never going to implement this BIP.
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:23:13
Almost, but with segwit enabled any miner could mine a block which brakes the segwit rules, and all nodes and miners which aren't upgraded to the still-to-be-released sw-flag-day-version would accept it, so when that happens the new segwit nodes and miners hard fork away from the rest of the network. BU would not hardfork by not including segwit transactions. BU only wants to do a hardfork blocksize increase, and only with a definite majority of hashrate, they can't do it earlier as 1mb blocks are still valid and would be the longest chain.
@_date: 2017-03-08 12:57:18
You are completely wrong about everything, miners don't want their blocks orphaned so they make valid blocks on top of the longest chain which they send to other miners to be built on-top of. What you are talking about only works if miners collude with &gt;50% hashrate. Nodes help pass blocks and transactions along but miners have the final say about policy and which transactions are ultimately accepted. If 90% of nodes don't support 2mb blocks, but 90% of miners do, then 2mb blocks are still going to make it into the longest chain. Just with a higher orphan rate, so by calculating the risk vs reward they would probably still make 1mb blocks unless there is high enough transaction fee's to make it worth it.
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:42:21
Just limit classic transactions to 1mb and let segwit transactions which has linear scaling use the whole 2-8mb. I would also think the segwit discount should be scaled down to 50% so the worst-case blocksize still stays at 4mb.
@_date: 2016-01-16 16:46:18
This is extremely likely to be a scam, do not send bitcoin to this website.
@_date: 2017-03-24 07:26:10
Should be theoretically possible to replace the entire thing with proof of stake, just let full nodes generate blocks at a ratio equal to the amount of coins they are holding. Doubt it could keep the name "Bitcoin" at that point, but could be a pretty cool altcoin which gives initial coins equal to current btc holdings.
@_date: 2017-03-31 13:37:31
Who are "they" in your sentence?
BIP148 will cause a fork.
Core 0.11 and 0.14 will both follow the longest chain and ignore the chain created by BIP148 miners. (if there are any)
@_date: 2017-03-31 06:53:59
That just makes it even scarier than a hard fork, at least a hard-fork wouldn't reorganize/invalidate the main chain.
I don't see why miners would switch over tho, unless the new UAF coin starts trading and gains higher value.
This BIP will either be ignored, cause a disaster, or get majority hashrate. The first two looks more likely.
@_date: 2017-03-30 13:03:31
It doesn't look like that all.
"135/576 (23.44%) blocks signaling in the past 24 hours"
@_date: 2017-03-23 09:59:53
Yes, most of the top core developers should sit down with most of the top miners and come up with an acceptable alternative asap. Core could offer f.ex to implement a capacity hardfork which activates with high activation threshold a couple years in the future, plus lower the segwit activation threshold. Or develop a new extension block soft-fork which both solves transaction malleability, and increases on-chain capacity over time.
@_date: 2017-03-30 06:36:54
Yeah, but it requires majority hashrate to not fork. This bip has no hashrate signalling requirement, so it's going to hardfork with minority hashrate.
@_date: 2017-03-08 11:10:24
Well your incorrect, what you probably mean to say is that nodes are part of the security as well. Nodes are also free to set maximum accepted blocksize. It's obviously in miners best interest to have their blocks propegate effeciently, they wouldn't want to create oversized blocks which are likely to be orphaned.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:47:36
Less than 30% of hashrate is signalling for segwit. Please stop trolling everyone's posts and read the bitcoin white paper:
"The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision
making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
able to allocate many IPs. 
They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."
I am aware things might have changed since then, but if you attempt a fork without nakamoto consensus, your still going to have a bad time. UAHF is opt-in to split from the network and follow a shorter chain. I am not saying splitting from most of the nodes are any great idea either, but Bitcoin is clearly not designed to have nodes dictate consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:22:22
Only consensus model to increase the blocksize, up to a maximum of 32mb i believe.
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:57:40
You can't just orphan the longest chain and call it a soft-fork.
Clients without BIP148 are going to follow the longest valid chain, not the new segwit-only chain (if there is any), hence it's a hard fork.
At the moment &gt;70% of blocks are not even signalling segwit support, much less BIP148 support.
There is no way this BIP is going to be enforced. Because as you said, it's not in the miners interest to fork the chain.
Full nodes trying to enforcing this BIP will just stop following the chain.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:24:04
Likely because of the statement from exchanges released earlier today about not supporting any hard fork. So either because they hoped the hard fork would come to the rescue, or because they made investors start getting wary of a looming hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:15:27
True, but what's wrong with it? it doesn't have to be new, the situation has developed and it's more relevant than ever.
@_date: 2017-03-31 10:17:21
I get the point, but i disagree that it could possibly work, UASF is just not taken that seriously. In a lot of ways it's the opposite extreme of BU, it's another even more contentious fork.
There is just no way that UAF coins will overtake the value of BTC. Perhaps bitfinex can list it as another pre-split token.
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:33:26
Yeah most people won't upgrade to segwit or BU as it is right now, but if core push for a clean one time hybrid/synthetic fork to 2 or 4mb, then i believe we can get consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-26 07:14:17
Yeah a hardfork with a cleaner version of segwit and increased capacity sounds optimal, but extremely hard to get consensus and everyone to upgrade.
@_date: 2017-03-12 12:50:55
Could probably work another way, but should at least include both potential coins.
All BTC is already both, so in case of a split where both coins have value then the exchange should split them so you have both. Theoretically an exchange could offer to split some of your current btc for future split-coins to trade with. But they wouldn't actually exist until there is a HF. And should somehow be able to convert back since it might not happen.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:16:28
The difference is that the story would end before point 6, the mining difficulty is the same on both chains, so it only makes sense to mine the highest valued coin. If btc-c is worth 400$ and btc-u is worth 450$, then btc-u would get 99%+ of hashrate and btc-c chain would never get to the next difficulty adjustment.
This goes both ways, if btc-c is worth more, miners switch and btc-u is wiped out.
@_date: 2017-03-11 14:30:33
The weight system feels very arbitrary and pushed into the protocol without considering how miners would actually prefer to prioritize.
@_date: 2017-03-13 02:10:47
Large majority being the key word here, running this flagday code is likely to fork you out of the network.
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:24:36
Yeah agreed. I know proposals like this is pretty much what the entire debate is about, but i can say right now that 1mb+segwit+lightning is not going to last forever, so whatever the next scaling step is, developers should have it prepared and compatible with current clients for when it needs to be activated in the future. A hf takes a very very long time as 100% of nodes need to be updated or forked off, so code should be implemented yesterday even if it's years ahead.
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:39:40
The code is rejecting valid blocks, nodes running this will hardfork on august 1st and basically just stop functioning.
@_date: 2017-03-21 07:55:41
Ah i see, if the new PoW adjusts it's difficulty to more than 10 minutes, f.ex 11 minutes, then the original PoW could gradually adjust down as long as the new PoW hashrate grows by less than 10% every 2016 blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:38:10
Just proposal stage i am afraid ;)
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:14:53
Miners are the only ones who can enforce upgrades, user activated fork would just split them off the network. A HF requires every single client to be upgraded or they will be split from the network, so it's risky and would take much longer time, but the advantage is you can do any kind of upgrade and do so cleanly.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:19:32
Agreed, but it won't be distributed like that, since the difficulty will stay the same, so the lower value chain will get very little support.
I mean if the price is f.ex 700 vs 300, the one worth 300 is not going to get 30% of the hashrate, because they need the same amount of work to make, it will likely get maybe 5% from idealists. If the losing chain is BU it will poof out of existence, and if the losing chain is Core it's a very good chanse it will die, unless the price gets really close.
@_date: 2017-03-28 08:36:32
UASF might be a more pressing issue, BU wouldn't fork until at least 75% of hashrate, which is unlikely to happen anytime soon, while BIP148 would immediately split the network on the first of October unless the majority of hashrate supports segwit at that point.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:18:47

@_date: 2017-03-17 00:56:31
Exactly, many miners are in it for the long haul, and they would love a blocksize increase.
They are more likely to be against off-chain solutions such as lightning, since it competes with their fee market.
But most of all miners would profit from increased exchange rate, so they should have what makes Bitcoin more valuable in mind.
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:14:43
The thing is you don't need to be a full node unless the network is compromised with &gt;50% of miners who are not validating consensus rules.
Satoshi explicitly said that full nodes would be big data centers in the future and everybody else can verify their transactions with an SPV node.
Adam obviously understands how PoW works as a delay to prevent spam and DoS attacks, but not how it's meant to work as a consensus layer in Bitcoin.
The longest most-PoW chain is Bitcoin, and if it's successfully attacked by majority hashrate to break consensus rules, then either we have a valid consensus change, or Bitcoin has failed.
@_date: 2017-03-28 08:14:03
I think it's pessimistic to think 5 settlements per second are enough capacity long-term. Should be prepared to increase capacity further than what segwit and lightning adoption potentially provides.

Knapsack problem has solutions that could be implemented, but practically a 2mb witness cap is unlikely to ever be reached, so it doesn't really need a solution.
It's a bit more complicated than that anyway, bigger blocks are slightly more likely to be orphaned etc.
Miners would probably want to adjust the fee weight anyway. The current weight system makes more than 75% discount unprofitable, but some may want to decrease it, to maximize fee's with a smaller block.
A simple cap makes anywhere between 0-100% valid, you may say this is making it more complicated, but i would say it's a feature.
And even if this is considered a minor inconvenience, a set cap at 1+2mb would allow more transactions and reduce the potential for abuse.
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:56:20
Yeah there will likely be a need for a hardfork capacity increase at some point anyway, which should have been planned for long in advance. If core just included code a couple years ago, to allow 2 or 4mb blocks at some point this year, (2+ years preparation, plus high percentage signal activation) then a hardfork wouldn't be noticeable for anyone except nodes/miners who didn't update for over 2 years, and things could have gone smooth. I am sure there would have been pressure to do it sooner, but would have avoided this whole mess. There might still be a chance, as i think &gt;75% BU hashrate will take a lot longer than people expect. Core could just plant some code now to allow 4mb in two years, so if this drags on for more than another year, people may just concede that the blocks will grow in 2019.
All they have to do is set "if (block height &gt; 550000) {change weight on legacy block data to 1} //same as segwit data", then we'll have 4mb of actual capacity for all transactions in 2019, and still only risk the same 4mb max blocksize as segwit. Activation signal could be the same as segwit so it's activated earlier, so plausibly 2mb capacity with segwit in 2018 and 4mb capacity in 2019.
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:27:24
They are not ignorant, it could be an excellent compromise.
There is a big difference between scaling the main block size and adding a new transaction type with a discount.
A future planned weight change from 1 - 4 to 1 - 2, would allow 2mb of non-segwit transactions, and up to 4mb usable space with segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:50:39
Sure, just organize with the miners to get that activated, maybe compromise if necessary ;)
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:48:54
Agreed, perhaps linear calculated using block height would be more safe and gradual.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:18:38
Exactly, that's why a soft fork requires a overwhelming majority to safely upgrade. If a "soft fork" is done with low hashrate, then the upgraded miners and nodes just hardfork themselves off from the longest chain.
@_date: 2017-03-31 05:50:48
Great writeup, however my concern about the BIP is not the consistency of the code, but the fact that it will cause a hard fork.
All clients without this BIP are going to follow the longest chain, so when a rejected block is built upon to become the longest chain, you either simply disconnect from the network, or some miners enforce the BIP, split the chain, and you now have a UASF alt-coin.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:31:58
Either way is fine by me, i would signal both if applicable.
But there is definitely a big difference as segwit only provides scaling with a new transaction format which is not currently in use, and if 100% of transactions use it, the capacity still only goes up to about 1.7mb. Perhaps 2mb maximum with tons of multisig. If segwit activated tomorrow the fee's would stay exactly the same, perhaps slowly moving down a little bit and then soar back to new all time high's again. If a 2mb HF activated, the capacity would double immediately and the backlog goes away. And when needed it would be done again to 4mb.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:11:40
Completely agree, but there is a big difference from ETC regarding the time it takes to reach the next difficulty adjustment. I believe most miners will change pretty quickly to whichever chain has the highest market value, resolving the split. Because the difficulty will stay the same on both chains, and it makes sense for miners to want the highest returns.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:11:25

@_date: 2017-03-31 10:35:52
Unless it has majority hashrate it will cause a fork where all current/old clients follow the main chain and clients running bip148 will follow a new chain.
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:39:44
Miners obviously have the power to veto against proposals, and in the case of segwit it should be pretty obvious that they have done so, as it's not in their best interest.
Too many people don't see segwit as the best possible upgrade.
Developers will need to revert on segwit and come up with a better proposal. 4 or 8mb of transaction capacity without any arbitrary discount should be more reasonable.
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:31:37
That's a possible opinion, but nakamoto consensus is determined by hashrate. Both miners and nodes can fork each other out, but only miners can make the longest most-worked chain.
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:20:14
I am sure there are some in that category, but most miners want bigger blocks as it allows larger share of future transactions fee's.
Small blocks and high fee's force transactions off-chain, and the usefulness of bitcoin transactions goes down. Miners (and users) want transactions on-chain, and if it costs less there will be more of them.
With f.ex 8mb blocks and 1/2 fee's, they earn 4 times more from fee's, not even taking into account how the increased usefulness increases exchange value.
Enabling segwit and smarter off-chain transactions would reduce the market for on-chain transactions and the fee's miners can collect. On the other side developers and especially blockstream has an interest in providing sidechain tech, so it's in their interest to keep the blocksize limited, and discount advanced signatures.
Segwit seems to provide the minimum capacity increase necessary to keep bitcoin functional as a settlement layer for lightning channels and large value transactions. Which is biased towards the developers interest.
A bigger capacity increase than what segwit provides is needed to make a compromise, and would greatly benefit users.
@_date: 2017-03-30 14:53:55
There is no "premium" unless you fork the chain and make an altcoin, which is exactly what bip148 would do.
Sure if the UAF coins are worth more, then miners would probably switch and reorganize the legacy chain, but this a very dangerous situation which will interrupt all bitcoin businesses.
If they understand the situation, a lot of businesses will likely suggest the same requirements as for BU - Make it a clean fork with replay protection.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:51:19
if you need a hardfork anyway, why in the world wouldn't you just fork to 2mb and resolve the fork, instead of making 3 incompatible bitcoin forks.
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:05:34
Yeah, a proper SPV implementation is secure as long as bitcoin is not compromised by a 51% attack.
If it doesn't verify the PoW headers and just trust whichever nodes it's connected to, then that's a different story.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:33:18
Don't worry, you'll have it on both chains, so whichever chain will be known as "Bitcoin" in the future, you'll have .1 of it. you'll also have .1 of the other kind of coin if both chains survive

Not to mention his proposal is idiotic "Getting that to work right is an interesting problem which I'm not sure how to do"
You can't reduce the original PoW difficulty without hard forking.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:45:10
I don't get it, so each "coin" or whatever have equal chance of being picked as the winner, but what if the owner is offline? i assume it keeps picking a new winner every X seconds and if a lot of owners are disconnected it will take longer to confirm blocks? And did it have something to do with scaling the proposed 1mb block size?
"When networks get faster, it is possible to increase the block size without any security risks, he contends."
But how?
I imagine at some point in the future a winner might make a 2mb block which half of the clients support, while the other half ignores.
@_date: 2017-03-26 05:19:16
2mb blocks would immidiately double the capacity of the bitcoin network.
It's a reasonable and managable increase.
It would quickly clear out the mempool and relieve fee pressure.
May or may not be worth the risk of hardforking, but a hardfork seems to be coming anyway, and everyone staying on the same chain is the whole point of not hardforking in the first place.
2mb + segwit should be (re)considered.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:49:33
Offered by who to who? link please.
Pretty sure 2mb+segwit was offered by a lot of miners currently running BU, which got rejected by Core.
@_date: 2017-03-18 01:23:30
That would be option number 2
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:55:22
+1 on this, even theymos said a 2mb fork should not be contentious when transaction costs approach 1$.
In fact the only change needed would be to change the weight from (4 - 1: 4M) to (1 - 0,5: 2M) This way a spam block still can't be larger than 4mb post-segwit, with a more reasonable 50% rather than 75% discount on witness data. We could probably also include some other important items from the HF wish-list. If your a developer, get to work ;)
To make the activation as smooth and pain-free as possible, please do a hybrid fork like this:
at around 75-90% hashrate - initiate soft fork invalidating/ignoring all blocks made by old versions, this forces every non-upgraded miner to upgrade, since ALL their blocks are orphaned. THEN activate the hardfork at 100% hashrate (1-2000 blocks, every single one made by the new version). This would guarantee that there is no chain-split whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:15:53
Without majority hash-rate, all clients without the UAHF-BIP will reject the shorter chain that tries to enforce it.
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:46:11
Early chat about it here: 
Looks like it was added to the code in july 2010: 
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:01:04
UASF is actually an extreme hardfork, if miners do nothing then a hard fork occurs as soon as a previously valid block is rejected.
Let's say 1/3 of hashrate upgrades to support a segwit flagday, then a new block which is not in consensus with the new rules will be mined by 2/3 of the network and become the longest chain. The upgraded miners are now hardforked to a minority chain with only 1/3 of the hashrate, effectively creating a new segwit altcoin, with new blocks only found about every 30 minutes. The original bitcoin retains 2/3 of hashrate, with blocks about every 15 minutes. Exchanges will rush to provide conversion between bitcoin classic and bitcoin segwit fork. Replay attacks will be abundant with transactions going into both chains. Very interested to see which one if either manage to hold a significant portion of the original value.
@_date: 2017-03-28 08:32:50
Let's see, user activated fork has:
Clear activation and on-chain coordination processes - Plausibly
Long grace period which reflects a pessimistic and conservative assessment of node upgrade capacity. - Unlikely
Strong 2-way replay protection which does not place excessive burden on the users. - No
Wipe-out protection, meaning that the hard fork must be permanent. - Probably
Must be entirely open-source at all times of the development and implementation process. - Yes
Must be peer-reviewed and tested extensively over a sustained period of time. - Possibly
So a user activated fork such as bip148 clearly does not comply with all of the above.
Any soft-fork without a majority of hashrate support would immediately enable a hard-fork split on the network.
@_date: 2017-03-21 06:52:59
It's a hard fork as soon as you reduce the original/current PoW difficulty. All non-upgraded clients will see it as an invalid block at that point.
You can only make the PoW harder with a soft-fork, not easier.
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:29:24
Oh!, i thought we were just talking about bip148.
But yeah BU never pretended not to fork, current/old clients enforce a 1mb cap, so they would not follow a &gt;1mb chain.
Personally i think the community should focus on making a compromise rather than threatening forks on both sides, there are many plausible options.
f.ex 2mb + segwit could be a good contender. (2mb legacy block + up to 2mb signature data outside the legacy block, 4mb total)
Of course that would still require a hard fork, but Core did originally consider to make segwit more efficient with a later planned hardfork, so they could do that plus double the capacity and a majority should be happy.
Another option would be to rewrite segwit from scratch as an extension block proposal (SF), so the new transaction format is placed completely outside the block. This could allow the transaction capacity to scale up much greater and more effectively than segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-31 10:30:43
Nobody is mining blocks containing segwit transactions until it's activated.
Currently miners are signalling support, if/when there is support signaled in &gt;950 of the last 1000 blocks, then it's locked in and activated.
Currently less than 30% are signalling support.
BIP148 is an attempt to force all miners to signal segwit support, what it does is simply reject all blocks not signalling segwit from a set date, so that segwit will lock in after another 950 blocks.
But only the clients who have implemented BIP148 will reject the blocks, the rest of the network will continue as usual, so as soon as the date arrives, unless a majority of miners are enforcing BIP148, then everyone running BIP148 will fork away from Bitcoin and perhaps become a new alt-coin.
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:04:54
70% should be enough to push it through, even if i am wrong i think it's worth to try, i can't honestly recommend people to use Bitcoin right now until this is resolved.
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:25:26
I agree, but it's for sure harder than a blocksize increase, and i'd say that's more important right now.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:35:44
Yes, that's true, but it's extremely likely to happen. A tiny pool or even a single miner could make that block. If personal conviction is not enough then i bet a sizable short position on an exhange could change the profitability.
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:18:33
Core claim central control over bitcoin right now, it's highly debatable which group is smaller and more centralized (a handful developers with commit access VS 75% of hashrate). You do know segwit won't have actual capacity more than about 1.7mb for regular/segwit/lightning transactions right? only specifically constructed spam would push it higher than 2mb.
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:11:23
Yeah it's a shame, i do believe most are actually about the solution rather than the development team tho, it's just the ones far out on each side which are very visible.
blockheight &gt; 500000 : set data block weight to 2 (2mb blocksize, up to 4mb with segwit transactions)
Would surely be enough to abort an earlier HF to 2mb from BU. I bet practically all miners and nodes would go along with it. It's really only the core development team that refuses to compromise.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:19:01
Segwit enables a new transaction format which will put the signatures outside the 1mb block space, and if a block is full with ONLY segwit transactions, it will still be less than 2mb.
So NO. Segwit (as-is) will NOT support 4mb of regular transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-13 01:50:27
They both pretty much accomplish the same thing, (solves malleated transactions with a new transaction format) flexible transactions does sound like a cleaner and more efficient upgrade than segwit tho, and an actual capacity increase has to be better than a arbitrary weight discount. Of course being able to do this with soft fork is very impressive, but it would ultimately be a bit better if we could do this kind of upgrade with a successful hard fork, which more and more miners are signaling that they want. I don't really trust the BU development team to do this correctly, and wish Core could be spending time making a better hard-fork proposal. I don't think anything will happen/resolve without some kind of hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:11:15

The way i see it, a HF needs to happen if the gridlock is ever going to be resolved. With all miners upgraded and ready to fork to the same chain, the only remaining problem is to ensure nodes are updated as well. IF both miners AND nodes upgrade, then i don't see what the problem is. The only thing i can think of is the quadratic scaling issue which should be easily managable by just capping the transaction size.

"force of hash" is the whole security model of the bitcoin blockchain.
OP suggested getting rid of the limit altogether, 32mb is a more reasonable absolute max limit, in addition to that BU uses nakamoto consensus to set the maximum blocksize lower (all the way down to 1mb at the moment). Overall miners will want to do what is most profitable, which is to sustain a healthy network and bitcoin value. They already have all the power since the beginning.
It's in every miners interest to distribute their block as quickly as possible so it won't get orphaned by the network. Any mining pool regardless of blocksize could withhold a new block, just send it to their friends and keep mining the longest chain invisibly, suddenly transmitting all of them to overtake the longest chain if they had 51%+. Your scenario doesn't have anything to do with the blocksize, the ping/speed of being closer together is the same with 100kb or 100mb, it's the bandwith and ram requirements that changes which would necessarily drop a few nodes of the network, but the increased usefulness of the network with larger blocks would attract more people to use the network and run nodes.
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:14:43
Currently yes, that's why segwit is activating now first, and then 2mb fork in November.
But a 2mb hard-fork would have been faster to develop and less-contentious with miners, so a planned fork could have been launched f.ex in summer 2015 with a 2-year activation time for everyone to upgrade.
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:58:58
There is also the unanimous public approval of 2x by miners. For 24 hours 100% of hashrate signalled "NYA" when segwit2x/bip91 locked in.
I doubt many users would be in favor of a split to preserve the 1mb limit. Core development team should just take a step back and provide the code that users want to run.
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:37:31
The state now is about 90% of hashrate signaling nya/segwit2x intention. I saw it hit 100% briefly on coin.dance, while generally hovering around 99%. I can try to lookup the exact blocks later, but on mobile right now.
Do these developers have any plans in the event of a drop to &lt;10% hashrate on the legacy chain?
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:23:56
Now would be a great time, i really don't think it's ever going to happen. As long as you follow Bitcoin Core you'll be on what is basically a 1mb chain forever.

Opinion on r/bitcoin is skewed towards the interest of the core client developers, while r/btc is skewed towards the interest of miners.
A large chunk of the prominent developers works for a company which provides off-chain transaction solutions. So it may not be in their interest that on-chain transactions works smoothly at low-cost.
On the other side miners want to keep all transactions on-chain where they can collect the fee's, so it may not be in their interest to allow off-chain transaction solutions.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:26:17
Double capacity, so twice as many transactions can confirm, and it will keep fee's more manageable until other solutions are implemented.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:36:22
There will likely be an update that allows more control, but with the current version of the software, breadwallet follows segwit2x by default.
So post-fork, assuming segwit2x is the majority chain, the displayed amount and transactions will be the current balance on the segwit2x chain.
When you send coins, it will most likely be sent on both chains. However confirmations will take much longer on the legacy chain, and you won't know through breadwallet if it's confirmed on the other chain.
You can optionally change to follow a node on the legacy core chain, in that case transactions are still sent on both chains, but you won't know what is happening on the majority chain.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:21:23
When it goes legacy to segwit, it looks like "anyone can spend" to old nodes, so when it goes segwit to legacy it's a perfectly valid transaction.
The funds can of course not be spent by everyone, because a supermajority of nodes and hash-rate are verifying the new signatures and will reject transactions without a valid segwit signature. So even tho some nodes may believe a fraudulent transaction is valid, it will never be included in a block, or even if it did, that block will be orphaned by the network.
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:00:05
Couldn't Bitcoin Core itself be considered non-consensus software now? the overwhelming majority of miners and quite a few exchanges are likely running btc1.

They didn't signal that they were against any blocksize increase, if they did they must have done a 180, because they are now explicitly marking their blocks with "NYA"

@_date: 2017-08-28 09:43:45
No one has authority to decide the weight of measurements like those.
Bitcoin actually has a consensus mechanism where 90-95% are vouching to hard fork now in November, other than that there are some measurements on coin.dance, and coin voting on vote.bitcoin.com
But there is simply no consensus on how to measure consensus.
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:04:45
Yes it has major non-miner support, but it's hard to quantify. The hashrate is clear.
Hopefully all major exchanges start making statements as soon as possible on how they are going to deal with the upgrade. I know my local exchange (bx.in.th) is already running btc1.
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:20:48
Hehe, thanks :)
I want to go to the moon as much as the next guy, but this looks like a bump with support at about 780, so i am guessing it could cross that number on the way down and then back up again shortly. I think the real rally fed by a media frenzy and some other chinese/international crisis is coming later. Wouldn't mind if it happens after a network consensus have been reached and implemented so all the new users could still be able to experiment with micro-transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:21:49
You can verify it yourself on the blockchain, there was a 24hour period when every single block had "NYA" written in the coinbase transaction.
I would say a client that stops seeing any new blocks being mined after segwit2x activation is unviable.
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:42:46
Yes, this is not going to be a split like Bitcoin Cash where a small fraction forks off. A compromise has been reached and the Bitcoin Core developers are being reckless by not implementing the new consensus code.
More than 90% of miners have pledged to upgrade, so the capacity and security on the legacy chain is going to be decimated. Leaving it vulnerable to attack, extremely unreliable for any transactions, and possibly it will not survive, effectively disconnecting all core nodes from the network.
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:29:00
With miners mostly looking to optimize their profits, if difficulty was adjusted all the time, each chain should have hashrate relative to the exchange value of it's block rewards.
So if BTC is worth 10 times more than BCH, it should get more or less 10 times higher hashrate.  However the difficulty only adjusts every 2016 blocks, so there is a risk that a large amount of miners will be going to switch to the most profitable chain each period, increasing congestion and fee's (especially for BTC) and causing confirmation delays (especially for BCH) whenever mining the other chain is more profitable.

Bitcoin capacity is basically filled 100% so it should have been pushed a long time ago.
The network would still be over 50% capacity if segwit activates.
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:24:05
When &gt;50% of miners still accept old blocks, there is going to be a fork. The longest chain will consist of both segwit signalling blocks and old blocks.
So it's just those running the UASF code (bip 148) who are going to fork off the network on their own chain, splitting Bitcoin into two coins.
@_date: 2017-04-27 10:50:49
1. Larger capacity will encourage growth in the bitcoin ecosystem and wider adoption, which is likely to increase the number of full nodes, not reduce it. Miner centralization is an issue, but not because of the blocksize, if miners want to withhold blocks from others for a longer time, they already can.
2. The fee's are now kept artificially and unnecessarily high, making bitcoin by far the most expensive blockchain alternative, causing bitcoin to be a worse payment option for most transactions. And locking up wallets with small amounts of bitcoin in them, which affects the majority of current wallet addresses.
3. Core does not yet have a scaling plan beyond segwit+schnorr - which would only increase the amount of transactions that can be sent on-chain by perhaps 60%. The fee's would stay artificially high.
4. That is the hard part, most of the current developers are fairly recent additions, prominent big-blockers have pretty much been kicked out.
And without going into it too deep: A lot of them are employed by a company which has received large funding from banks, many don't hold or use a lot of bitcoin themselves, and may possibly have other agenda's which could skew the perspective of what is best for bitcoin.

Anything in-between success and obvious failure would be a disaster. It should either clearly have majority hashrate and other miners switch over, or it should not be activated.
Otherwise, there will be a fork and a new altcoin. (UAF coin?) This chain would have a very long time between blocks and wouldn't have any replay protection etc.
It will also hurt the main chain a lot, not only does capacity go down by whatever percentage mines UAF, but there will be large uncertainty if the new chain ever overtakes majority hashrate and undo all transactions on the main chain since the split.
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:01:24
The proposed fix is:
Beginning at block height X, each block must contain a WTXID commitment with ID 0xaa21a9ed or 0xaa21a9ef.
Where 0xaa21a9ed is for segwit, and 0xaa21a9ef is for extension block.
So if this fix is enforced, it seems each block would have to vote for one of the two proposals or be orphaned.
Unless majority hashrate ignores the fix, then all nodes/miners who implemented the fix will be forked to a different chain, similar to bip-148 (uasf).
@_date: 2017-04-18 05:18:26
I think he was right, the problem is that a small group decided the blocksize limit which was never meant to be reached could not be increased, so here we are with small blocks and high fee's.
Please note that segwit/2mb is still considered small.
@_date: 2017-04-27 13:50:08
Sure. I don't really doubt that it is technically possible, but i have reservation about how user-friendly it is. I am looking forward to seeing end-user wallets powered by lightning, if it catches on as something most people are happy to use, if they save transaction fee's by doing so, and if any people start losing funds because of missed lock-times etc.
@_date: 2017-04-03 06:23:32
You may be right, nobody likes to compromise. But it's either a compromise or a split, so hoping for a compromise. segwit+2mbhf seems the most reasonable, hf date could perhaps be pushed a bit into 2018 to be safer.
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:52:13
I will thanks, hope it can get activated.
Wonder if the EB proposal will have some kind of scaling mechanism similiar to BU.
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:14:33
The issue is with a single big transaction, not many small ones, and is easily fixed by limiting the size of a single transaction.
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:31:12
It's very extreme, and going to cause massive disruption. I really hope it doesn't get hashrate in the 25-49% grey area. The faster it's enforced or ignored the better.
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:15:20
He actually did contemplate the evolution of hashpower tho, he said full nodes would be big datacenters, using specialized hardware for mining.
All regular users can use SPV wallets to verify the longest PoW chain and their own transactions.
As long as &gt;50% of hashpower can be trusted to do full block verification, the system works perfectly.
You just need enough full nodes to prevent sybil attacks, they are not needed for verification unless miners cheat, which is unlikely because it would drastically reduce the value of bitcoin and the miners profit.
@_date: 2017-04-08 14:57:56
I would like to see some stats on that. Barely any businesses have vouched for it, and it has slim support from nodes and miners so far.
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:33:28
Yes, please ignore Luke, he's practically the only one that wants to decrease the blocksize and replies everywhere.
The bandwith and resources for a 2x-8x capacity increase is still well within reason for most people to run a full node with if they want to, and using an SPV wallet is more than secure enough anyway, as you can verify all your transactions and nobody else have access to your funds.
In fact the small blocksize is pushing users to trust centralized 3rd party services such as coinbase to do transactions, which is exactly what you would want to avoid.
@_date: 2017-04-27 15:08:41
It's clearly a difference of philosophy, Bitcoin was supposed to be peer-to-peer cash.
Satoshi predicted full nodes would be running in large data centers while users utilized SPV nodes. Transaction fee's were supposed be almost free for a very very long time.
Something like lightning channels would be useful for actual micro-transactions, such as paying for streaming movies by the second, or tipping websites sub-cent amounts for access to content.
Bitcoin should compete directly with traditional semi-trusted services, all bitcoin users should be able to send each other money cheaply and effectively without trusting paypal-like centralized services such as coinbase.
This is the big-blocker philosophy, we are aggravated by the unwillingness to remove the 1mb blocksize limit, and offended by complicated scaling solutions that would keep severely limiting on-chain capacity, and artificially keep an expensive fee market.
The trust could be in &gt;50% of hashrate to enforce the rules, if miners ever get away with stealing any funds from a single user, or creating more coins than they are entitled to on the longest chain, then bitcoin has failed. Everyone doesn't need to run their own full node to verify this, you just need to trust that someone somewhere who does run a full node would find out and make an announcement about it.
@_date: 2017-04-01 12:30:39
Get to it i'd say. Design, review, implement, test, validate.
The question should be when and how a &gt;1mb fork will activate. Nobody (or very few) wants bitcoin to be stuck on 1mb capacity forever.
Does it take a year to be done safely? then set the activation date a year from now. Does it need 2 years? alright, let's agree to have it activate 2 years from now.
Get started on the hardfork wishlist, don't deny every single hf proposal.
People want bigger blocks, not just segwit, so let's get through the obstacles to eventually make it happen.
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:55:09
i like it, it should be possible to read data and sign transactions, but to sign transactions you need to verify on the display like other hardware wallets.
@_date: 2017-04-10 07:12:29
It's likely to work for LTC, but don't assume it's going to go smoothly with BTC.
@_date: 2017-04-04 09:06:33
Yeah they can be spv nodes to the extension block while staying full node to the canonical block.
This keeps the best of both worlds, there will be large datacenters securing the extension blocks, (BU/satoshi philosophy) home/standard nodes further securing the canonical block as full nodes to that, (be your own bank) and regular users on SPV light nodes.
@_date: 2017-04-04 20:39:03
They would only need to verify the extension blocks to compete for the extension block fee's.
They can keep mining 1mb blocks just fine, and the fee's there will likely stay a lot higher anyway, so the centralization risk is limited.
I think the proposed lightning network has much higher potential for risky centralization.
@_date: 2017-04-21 17:07:21
That was not helpful at all, random people who use bitcoin??? please explain. How is support measured, how does something like a soft-fork become included in a new version of Bitcoin Core?
By the way, padded with spam? care to show some examples? who's paying the fee's and why?
@_date: 2017-04-27 10:15:49
The extension block proposal is a modification of segwit that would support big blocks as soft-fork: 
Including malleability fix, covert asicboost prevention, and better lightning network support.
There is a lot of toxicity on both sides.
@_date: 2017-04-27 15:28:06
Must be a bug, looks normal on: 
@_date: 2017-04-18 20:29:13
Are you saying most people shouldn't use bitcoin and get a fair fee, because it wouldn't run on your crappy old computer?
If bitcoin upgrades with extension blocks, your full node would still work and verify the 1mb chain, plus everyone who wants to can opt-in to send cheaper transactions on the extension block which are only verified by the stronger/better full nodes.
@_date: 2017-04-29 16:43:05

@_date: 2017-04-15 05:55:54
The pool you are talking about pays out a fixed 13,75btc per block, the 10% above 12,5 is covered by transaction fee's. This is nothing new or secret.
Satoshi envisioned Bitcoin would have close to free transactions forever, and that miners/full nodes would be run by big data centers, with the vast majority using SPV nodes and other light clients.
The original whitepaper and early statements looks a lot more in line with what BU is trying to do, but there is obviously no way to tell for sure what Satoshi would have supported, if it even matters.
My home computer has &gt;5tb hardrive and unlimited &gt;25mbit connection, theoretically if i really needed to run a full node i could just buy another 5tb a year and support up to 100mb blocks.
But no consensus implementation would go anywhere near that size for an extremely long time, and i don't have any need to run a full node.
@_date: 2017-04-16 19:42:44
I bet everybody you are referring to as newbies knows segwit can grow transaction capacity by perhaps 60-70% over time when everybody switches to it.
If anything the actual newbies are made to believe segwit will quickly double or even quadruple the transaction capacity.
The lightning network is nowhere near ready to take over transaction processing, i hope it works in practice, but remains to be seen.
A ton of outputs/wallets are locked forever since the fee to spend them are higher than the amount they hold.
A lot of people understand that there is a real need to increase on-chain capacity beyond what segwit offers.
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:07:28
Bitmain claims they never used it, so it's possible they will support segwit+2mb or extension blocks with asicboost blocked.
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:03:12
Extension block proposal is on-board with fixing covert asicboost.
Looks like the fix would be going to force a vote for either segwit or extblock.
So we get malleability fix and LN either way, but the vote is on between keeping blocks small (&lt;2mb) or allow some more growth (3-9mb)
I wonder if ext-block also includes the new OP code requested by LN developers, that would allow channels to stay open (segwit doesn't)
@_date: 2017-04-18 18:48:06
Got a link showing how that is calculated? what blocksize would kick out half the nodes?
Importantly tho, most of the nodes to be kicked off are the ones running on webhosting services, and many nodes running from servers in the same physical location obviously doesn't help decentralization.
Bandwidth is not an issue at all, a sub-standard 10mbit connection is enough to send or receive thousands of transactions per second.
There are few places in the world where a landline is capped by monthly limits, and the speeds are increasing quickly.
Storage is not prohibitively expensive, full blocks with a 8mb blocksize would grow the chain by 0,42TB per year. Buying a 2TB HD which would be good for 5 years is currently about 100$.
I believe the blocksize should eventually be increased to and capped at 32mb which is the original limitation of the protocol. We'll have much better and secure off-chain solutions live and in use, long before reaching that limit.
Don't believe all the F,U&amp;D out there, i am positive optimized code and future PI's will be able to handle it.
@_date: 2017-04-27 14:04:54
Not really any more than they would have to trust them with segwit.
Only difference would be that nodes without the EB bip can't see transactions happening inside the EB.
But i am sure if EB activates that the majority of nodes would quickly be supporting it.
And it's a softfork which will require majority hashrate, possibly &gt;95%, so any blocks that don't follow the rules will be orphaned.
Security-vise, it's the same for segwit - even tho old nodes can see the transactions, they can't verify the signature, so they would accept blocks with transactions stealing the funds. But again, those blocks would be orphaned as long as the new rules are enforced by the majority hashrate.
@_date: 2017-04-26 11:34:11
It's not clear to me that this is about asicboost, they are referring to the cost of technical debt and surrendering to the small-block camp.
I can see how the english translation seems to indicate it, but i can't say for sure without being able to read and understand the context in the original chinese text.
Having said that, i agree that blocking covert asicboost should be a priority to make sure that it does not influence the decision.
@_date: 2017-04-26 04:54:47
The extension block proposal fixes transaction malleability and does not allow covert asicboost.
@_date: 2017-04-25 18:13:47
1+2mb would fit a lot more normal transactions and less 16 of 16 multisig transactions
@_date: 2017-04-12 19:27:42
your coins are safe :) exchange value is close to the highest ever, no serious fork yet (short one last summer, but they got orphaned pretty quickly, one single chain still)
main news is the 1mb blocksize limit has been reached and transaction fee's are a lot higher.
there is a threat of 2 upcoming forks, "BU" which wants to get rid of the 1mb limit by hardfork (continiously by a new mechanism called emergent consensus), and "UASF" which want to force miners to signal for a new soft-fork called segwit which fixes a lot of problems, but only have about 30% of miners supporting it. (obviously trying to enforce a new rule with minority hashrate would split the chain)
@_date: 2017-04-04 07:22:45
Because it's minimal, adding at most 1mb of capacity. It's actually making the canonical block smaller.
Extension block would likely support 4mb and/or more, allowing bitcoin to be used as digital cash on-chain.
This proposal looks really good, it's opt-in and not taking any security away or introducing any centralization risk on the standard transactions in the 1mb block.
This proposal is a segwit replacement, both proposals support lightning for micro-transactions, but this one makes lightning settlements easier, faster and cheaper to use.
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:25:51
Interesting that google is converting 1 bitcoin to less than 2k bolivars.
@_date: 2017-04-17 19:39:04
As mentioned already, if you can change the fee on your wallet, just try sending it every once in a while with a tiny fee until you get lucky. (weekends are more likely)
Either way it shouldn't be going anywhere, hopefully a capacity increase could reduce the fee's in the future.
@_date: 2017-04-07 11:16:59
Thank you, very smooth!
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:39:05
(main!) Malleability fix (enables lightning network)
Increased capacity (about 60% estimated higher capacity with full adoption)
Covert Asicboost prevention
Cheaper to spend outputs (75% discount on prunable signature data, may be viewed as both pro or con as it changes the fee economics)
Soft-fork, same utxo set for old nodes
(main!) Limited capacity increase, sustained fee market
Requires using a new transaction format to gain benefits
Additional protocol technical debt
Less optimized than plausible hardfork solution(s) such as flexible transactions, and capacity increase compatible with the current transaction format
Up to 4mb blocksize liability if someone wants to spam the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-04-21 18:06:32
Research != Implementation
So far whatever research they did made luke come up with a blocksize reduction proposal. Maybe they want a 100kb max blocksize soft-fork after some more research.
@_date: 2017-04-16 05:09:57
Aren't those the same thing?, an SPV node verifies the proof of work and trusts that the longest most-work chain contains valid transactions.
@_date: 2017-04-17 11:14:25
Schnorr would in best case scenario reduce the signature from 75 to 64 bytes on a standard transaction, which is already outside the 1mb block with segwit anyway.
(75-64)/4 = 2,75 bytes saved (best case scenario). So you'll get practically no capacity benefit from this, 1% increased capacity with full adoption?
It only really saves on multisig size within the extended segwit space.
You are not getting anywhere near 4x current capacity with segwit+schnorr, plausibly a 60-70% increase total still.
Segwit could easily be improved to allow more capacity if they had a flat segwit cap in addition to the 1mb canonical cap, instead of the weight algorithm which takes space away from the canonical block.
@_date: 2017-04-27 08:16:23
I'd much rather have the on-chain capacity increased so Bitcoin can handle transactions on it's own, without relying on alt-coins.
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:40:40
4mb spam blocks that is. Estimated capacity increase is 1.6x after everyone changes to the new transaction format. most people want at least a 2x capacity increase, and would prefer if it's compatible with the current transaction format(s)
@_date: 2017-04-27 11:39:01
I added schnorr to the core roadmap while you were writing the reply, it's nowhere near 30%, it's merely a couple bytes off the signature, which would already be 75% discounted through segwit, so the actual capacity increase could be 1-2% or so.
I am trying to account for capacity in number of average transactions, not what you could potentially do with 15 of 15 multisig etc.
Bitcoin can't differentiate between spam and genuine use, but history and all other altcoins show that the blocks do not fill up to the maximum size even if fee's are a small fraction or even free.
The fee's are now set by market demand on a network with artificially limited capacity, which was not supposed to happen. It's a difference of philosophy not technical expertise which is causing the community divide. The block reward is supposed to offset cheap transactions to allow bitcoin to grow, 50 years from now we may all use lightning channels which are opening and closing on a 32mb chain with a billion users and more than enough transaction fee's to sustain secure mining. Nobody knows for sure or if lightning even practically works, but it should be clear that the capacity was not meant to be artificially limited to less than 5 transactions per second. There should not have been major fee's for a very long time.
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:54:25
The one which reduces the blocksize until 2024?
Are you saying the blocks aren't full? almost every block uses the whole 1mb. Option B would mean to have a capacity increase ready when the average block went above 500kb.
Who is the "community" or "users" who are rejecting the proposals from being included in Bitcoin Core, can you please explain what that means? How exactly is consensus decided among Bitcoin Core developers?
@_date: 2017-04-21 18:18:18
It's that first part i would like to see more information about, how exactly is consensus reached among developers?
The second part sounds like it makes sense, but in practice it seems like approval is left to the developers, and the user rejection is left to the miners.
@_date: 2017-04-17 04:59:39
Strongly disagree, fee's and confirmation delays like we have now were never supposed to happen.
We could do extension block soft-fork instead of segwit to allow &gt;4x capasity, or how do you imagine it should be done?
@_date: 2017-04-25 18:28:59
soft fork
1mb canonical base blocksize limit
2mb witness block limit
3mb total
fee weight can then be customized by miners depending on demand.
allows more transactions, no chanse of excessive &gt;3mb blocks.
segwit as-is reduces the maximum size of the base-block by 1/4 of what is added to the witness space. f.ex 1mb witness + 0.75mb base.
free weights would allow f.ex 1,5mb witness + 1mb base
@_date: 2017-04-01 07:55:04
Read the full survey here: 
There is a lot of support for a small hardfork capacity increase in addition to segwit.
A compromise segwit+2mb proposal was submitted yesterday: 
We are all aware that segwit is eventually a capacity increase to perhaps 2mb. But it's not the same as a hardfork capacity increase compatible with the current transaction format.
I would also vouch for an additional capacity increase to 2mb on the main chain, so we can relieve the fee pressure, allow smaller outputs to be spent, then scale to 4mb with segwit.
There is no perfect solution, a compromise needs to be accepted to make peace and avoid a contentious BU, BIP148 or PoW fork.
@_date: 2017-04-12 19:12:29
Surprising if they don't give a UAF minority chain the BTU treatment (make a new named token and demand replay protection)
@_date: 2017-04-01 06:35:44
They signaled in each of their last 4 blocks now.
@_date: 2017-04-26 05:15:23
The proposal is developed by bcoin and has a page at 
It's a modification of BIP 141 and fixes transaction malleability the same way segwit does.
One of the developers is Joseph Poon, who is also working on developing the lightning network.
The extension block proposal includes some additional lightning network security not included in the segwit proposal.
The initial draft didn't include ASICBoost prevention and got immediate support from Jihan.
As soon as the covert ASICBoost controversy went public, the developers added covert ASICBoost prevention.
As far as i know Jihan has not pledged any support or refusal since then.
The extension block proposal is still under development and just launched on testnet a few days ago, there is no "other" version that i am aware of.
@_date: 2017-04-02 17:03:45
segwit+2mb hardfork would be great, if we could agree on that.
segwit by itself only allows cheaper signatures with the new transaction format, so yes we could fit a few more transactions into blocks when all wallets are using it by default, but it's going to take a long time, and even then i doubt it will really amount to a doubling.
Lightning might be great, but it's untested, and a lot harder for new users to understand.
@_date: 2017-04-17 06:41:41
bip141 could be changed to work as an extension block with higher capacity, this gets harder and messier to do with segwit already activated.
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:30:08
If the margins are that tight, it's a very scary situation.
Let's say the bitcoin value dropped to 800$ for a month, would all miners quit and the bitcoin chain die?
The fee's would eventually equalize when everybody switches transactions to the new extension block format, but there is going to be a long transition.
And there should be no more risk than activating segwit if the size is limited to 3mb (4mb total) which is the same size that could potentially be mined in a segwit block, except it would have to be spam by segwit, while an extension block could actually utilize the whole space for transactions.
@_date: 2017-04-27 13:57:57
The current extension block proposal is a segwit replacement, they are not compatible with each other.
Adding extension block next to segwit would require a lot more code with technical debt, and more transaction formats.
I think the plan will be to compete with the next segwit proposal if/when the current one fails in November.
@_date: 2017-04-16 20:40:33
Your example is not a lie, the blocks would stay full, and fee's are unlikely to drop much after segwit activates.
@_date: 2017-04-25 18:51:00
it would likely lead to even higher segwit discounts, especially in the beginning, since adding signatures doesn't cost any base blockspace.
there is no definite/accurate answer to UTXO/cpu/blockspace accounting. It should not be a flat 75% discount, so this would be a win-win.
@_date: 2017-04-06 18:00:39
How is this not a reasonable statement?
Wanting bigger blocks doesn't mean you support Bitmain, BU or EC.
I would like to see asicboost blocked and a compromise scaling solution, such as extension blocks or segwit + 2mb hardfork.

Remote shutdown is confirmed, but remote arbitrary code execution? any source on that?
@_date: 2017-04-17 16:45:43
All wallets i have used have terrible fee handling, i hope to make my own wallet at some point in the future.
None of the wallets i have used tell you the size of the transaction before broadcasting, and you have no idea which inputs are being used.
You could send a tiny transaction with a small fee only to realize it locks up multiple bitcoin from a large input which you can't spend while waiting for confirmation, or it may be from multiple dust inputs which makes the transaction a lot larger than expected.
I'd mainly just like to have manual control of which inputs to use, and set the fee per byte. A confirmation should be displayed with all the details of the transaction before broadcasting, and have option to re-send or replace if necessary.
The wallet itself should be possible to easily set what kind of node it should be: full/spv/minimal, and where data is saved. Big plus if it also supports some alt-coins simultaneously.
@_date: 2017-04-01 10:38:44
Who is it that are supposed to be able to change the rules?  
If politics don't matter are we supposed to just go along with whatever Core makes, or whatever the miners support?
Or does whoever holds the most bitcoin get to decide? or the biggest exchanges?
Bitcoin is a complicated system. To resolve the current issues without a fork, a compromise needs to be reached, and sw2mb is a great alternative.
Let's have a healthy open discussion about it.
@_date: 2017-04-17 20:23:57
Most miners and users want bigger blocks, so if developers agreed, it could be done.
But extension blocks can be activated with just majority hashrate and a few nodes without splitting the chain, so i'll vouch for that option.
And the obvious final statement: Your opinion that capacity doesn't need to be increased is simply wrong.
@_date: 2017-04-27 11:07:25
The proposal linked to above suggests there will be a fixed weight based on size, utxo etc, but have not yet decided on exact values. Just rumored to be in the 3-10mb range for now.
I would also like to know what the plan is, but it makes sense to leave it open to discussion for now to avoid everybody already complaining that it's too small or too large.
@_date: 2017-04-02 14:02:45
Hostile is a strong word, they just rightly have a different opinion. Growing on-chain capacity increases both the number of fee's they can collect, and the usefulness of Bitcoin, which can likely increase the Bitcoin exchange rate. It's a lot more than a few people who shares this view.
The capacity increase from segwit alone would be barely noticable and keep the blocks full.
@_date: 2017-04-17 19:59:04
It's obvious we disagree on what blocksize is needed, it sounds extremely pessimistic that &lt;2mb is considered enough capacity long-term.
It should already have been raised to 2mb a long time ago.
Wish core developers just went for the hardfork option.
They still should, we probably need &gt;2mb soon, better to do it early with a long activation time to allow clients to upgrade.
If a hardfork can't be agreed to, then a soft-fork is the only option, and extension block seems to be the only solution for big blocks as a soft-fork (big-blocks means bigger blocks than what segwit offers)
@_date: 2017-04-19 10:32:07
I mostly agree, except segwit has an obvious problem, it is keeping the blocksize small on purpose. It doesn't seem to care about keeping all the nodes as it has a 4mb liability, but only improves capacity by up to 1.6-2mb, and does so by taking away some space from the 1mb block because of the weight system.
Extension block is a fairly straightforward modification of segwit which allows bigger blocks without taking any capacity away from the original 1mb portion.
More expertise and testing is good, but it's also positive for the decentralisation of bitcoin development if a proposal from outside the core group gets implemented.
@_date: 2017-04-17 08:50:13
you don't?
@_date: 2017-04-04 11:51:21
opt-in in the same way as segwit, you can ignore the extension blocks and keep using normal transactions with 1mb blocks

There is a patch available to install, while most just signal with a comment. 6 of the last 100 blocks when i checked had "bip148" flagged, and a few nodes as well.
I have seen very little support outside of so i would like to see how you can be so sure it has unanimous support.
Segwit by itself has a lot of support, but clearly not "unanimous" support.
And segwit support is not the same as UASF support. It's an extremely risky and contentious fork, which a lot of people (including segwit supporters) don't like.
@_date: 2017-04-04 07:53:40
The blocks are certainly full, and an extension block soft-fork is opt-in to use, it would not lead to any more centralization or reduce the security of the 1mb blockchain, which will still be there to be used exactly as before.
It will however additionally enable large-scale use of bitcoin, enable the majority of outputs currently locked as to-small-to-spend, fix transaction malleability, and enable the lightning network.
@_date: 2017-04-18 20:47:16
fee's are very unlikely to go down much after segwit activation, and will fill up again soon. Segwit also increases capacity and what is needed to run a full node by 60-70%
I am mostly in favor of an extension block, BU/EC has a lot of baggage and would be a contentius fork disaster.
Better to do a soft-fork and enable two categories of full nodes, 1mb maximum security for savings and 4-32mb for general use.
@_date: 2017-04-20 15:07:30
Why shouldn't developers join the meeting? Sounds like there should have been a lot more developers there, so a real agreement could have been reached, with enough developers on-board so the code resulting from such an agreement could actually end up being implemented in the Bitcoin Core client.
Perhaps a new meeting could be arranged?
@_date: 2017-04-13 05:38:00
depends on the UASF hashrate, if it's &lt;50% then eventually the canonical chain will be a lot longer, and UASF won't catch up unless the coins have a higher value making miners want to switch over
@_date: 2017-04-25 18:40:52
read above, do the math. 1.5mb of segwit signatures, plus 1mb in the base block is less than 3mb, but equals 5.5million units of weight.
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:53:52
Counting number of transactions it's about 1.6x capacity increase.
Close to 4mb would have to be specially crafted with stuff like 16 of 16 multisig, so it's not a myth.
UTXO balance is arguable, 75% discount is a very specific number and an economic change in the fee market.
It would be a lot better if segwit enabled 1mb of canonical data + 2mb of signature data, miners balance the fee, we'd get higher capacity, and less risk.
@_date: 2017-04-10 17:42:25
purse.io might have recieved funding from bitmain/ver (rumor), jihan has not yet commented if he still supports extension blocks after they changed the code to block asicboost.
my opinion:
A patch to block asicboost should be released asap, not dependent on segwit or extension blocks.
Extension blocks could likely be a better proposal than segwit, if/when segwit fails to activate it should be seriously considered.
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:34:59
I am not talking about Bitcoin itself, but the Core reference client.
At what point in the development process do users decide what gets included in the latest version of Bitcoin Core?
Please enlighten me if there is any kind of user vote system, other than people running nodes choosing not to install new versions.
I am interested in the governance of the Core reference client, i believe it's 100+ developers, writing code and discussing on the mailing list. But only a few have actual access to commit or veto new changes and officially release updates. These are the people who should discuss with miners to educate them and come up with a technically sound compromise.
@_date: 2017-04-07 07:18:05
If it's being used, it's only on empty blocks correct? Otherwise transactions need to be shuffled around, which antpool doesn't do.
Viabtc seems to do so however.
@_date: 2017-04-06 17:52:14
I really hope they will continue development of this proposal, it has all the benefits of segwit and will allow a bigger capacity increase.
Their idea seems to be a points and cap system, so rather than giving a 75% signature discount they could simply add a cost on creating new outputs to limit UTXO growth.
And it should obviously not be used as way to still enable asicboost, they could implement a fix for that, but most likely that will be implemented as a separate BIP. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:23:56
When &gt;50% of miners still accept old blocks, there is going to be a fork. The longest chain will consist of old blocks, so everyone running the UASF code (bip 148) is going to fork off the network on their own chain, splitting Bitcoin into two coins.
@_date: 2017-04-04 19:52:08
I'll need to see how a user-friendly lightning client/wallet looks like and operates, before i am convinced that this is ready for mass-adoption.
You'll probably still need to rely on some kind of service provider to close out your contracts on-chain while you are offline, so you won't get ripped off by expired lock-times.
There is no way most people are going to keep track of all of this manually, or even understand what is going on.
@_date: 2017-04-20 19:31:11
Segwit creates a liability up to 4mb blocks and a lot of people are not completely on-board with the 75% discount of witness data.
A straightforward hardfork to do at a later time would be to change the weight from 1-4 to 1-2, changing the discount of witness data to 50%, enabling 2mb with current/classic transactions, and up to 4mb blocks with segwit.
This could have been part of segwit and activate f.ex 1 year after segwit activation. So remaining nodes and miners would know they have 1 year to update after segwit activation.
To avoid abuse of quadratic scaling on classic transactions, it would also make sense to limit the size of a single transaction, 100kb f.ex should be more than enough.
@_date: 2017-04-12 19:44:21
no, segwit activation is the same, the new segwit rules are enforced after &gt;950 of last 1000 blocks signal segwit.
UASF (bip148) is a proposal to reject all blocks not signalling segwit from august 1st and until activation, if this bip is not enforced by majority hashrate, then the chain will split almost immediately on august 1st, as the longest valid chain still contains blocks which don't signal for segwit activation.

He owns a ton of Bitcoin, can't get much more "stake" than that.

What would be a sane alternative to segwit in your opinion? A lot of people wanted to have segwit + extension blocks, wouldn't it make technical sense to combine them into one?
@_date: 2017-04-17 19:19:21
Segwit looks good to solve transaction malleability, but that could also be solved with extension block.
Segwit is not ideal as a blocksize increase, because of how limited the additional capacity will be, and it has an attack surface allowing blocks to be more than twice the size of any normal usage.
So if extension block doesn't make sense to further increase the capacity on-chain, then what does?
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:35:44
That's the essence of the conflict, a lot of core developers want the blocks to stay small for non-technical reasons.
5% is a very safe margin to scale, the hard part is making that first step above 1mb, it would be a lot safer if a bigger-than-segwit on-chain scaling-solution would be accepted into the Bitcoin Core reference client.
@_date: 2017-04-20 14:31:38
If you don't understand, "big blocks" means a blocksize cap larger than what the transaction market demands, so all or most blocks mined would be a lot smaller than the maximum cap, which is obviously more than what segwit would increase the blocksize to.
And "blocksize increase" generally means to increase the size of the base 1mb canonical blockspace by hardfork, so transactions in the current format is compatible with the additional space.
Segwit only enables additional space to a new transaction format, and the block-weight causes the 1mb canonical blockspace to shrink.
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:30:59
i am happy with both as well, but the sooner a post-segwit scaling solution is decided upon to start preparing the better.
people seem to say that a hardfork can both happen quickly when needed, and must be prepared for long in advance at the same time.

How is being pro bigger blocks not compatible with wanting to reduce spam. Predictable and reasonable fee's are not a bad thing. But having fee's go out of control and force transactions off-chain because the blocks are full is a major problem.

You immediately jumped to FUD without understand what i meant at all.
Segwit can activate first, further scaling way later if needed.
If you set a hardfork f.ex 5 years in the future to increase the blocksize limit to f.ex 8mb, this leaves plenty of time to upgrade all clients and avoid a chain split. A new soft-fork can be deployed within those 5 years to set the maximum block size anywhere between 0 to 8mb. 
8mb is going to be too little in 5 years IMO, but if 1mb with segwit and lightning is awesome and we agree to keep it that way, then the limit can just be kept at 1mb as soft-fork, no damage done whatsoever.

8-32MB (big onchain now)
This will give bitcoin the best chance to grow rapidly as worldwide trust-less digital cash.
It's the maximum allowed, not what the blocks will actually become.
These sizes are not going to be any problem for miners - bandwith and storage is cheap, asic's are not.
Small miners can just join a pool that allows them to only hash the headers, while still holding hash power decentralized to be switched to any other pool if necessary.
There only needs to be enough full nodes to prevent sybil attacks and be miner watchdogs, ensuring they don't cheat.
There will be enough enthusiasts and businesses who still run decentralized full nodes.
The majority of people use light wallets and this will bring more users back to fast and secure on-chain transactions instead of trusting third-parties.
Offline paper wallet or hardware wallet + spv node is more than safe enough for holding savings.
Majority of miners can agree to soft limit to a smaller blocksize while/if necessary.
Full nodes (bitcoin core?) could enforce minimum fee's, f.ex if a transaction doesn't include a 10satoshi/byte fee it won't be relayed, if enough nodes do this the fee market becomes balanced and predictable, processing all transactions quickly at the same fee even on peak times.
A real fee pressure can naturally begin long into the future after massive adoption, if we reach 32mb blocks or when the block reward is significantly reduced. By that time lightning/sidechains etc have surely been properly developed and are actively being used live.
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:41:57
We don't need to scale to 246mb, we should just scale up to maybe 8mb now, while developing transaction channels, sidechains and extension blocks.
Then perhaps we'll scale all the way just up to 32mb in the future, which is reasonable for miners, businesses, and users with a bit of cash who wants to verify the whole chain for themselves.
Regular users will use spv/light clients, protected by hash rate and the economic majority.
It's unreasonable that the majority who don't need a full node has to pay extremely exacerbated fee's, just because some people demand to be able run their full node on a raspberry pi with capped bandwidth.
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:55:45
It should be 100% or 0% to avoid a split, so far no miners have pledged to mine on the bip148 chain, bitfury is likely interested but doesn't make sense to try unless the bip148 chain is sure to win and/or have higher valued coins after a fork, either way any sustained fork would be a disaster.
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:21:27
Would you grudgingly accept? just need to avoid a chain split and move things along, it's a small increase and could get median fee's bellow 1$ again.

Bitcoin is the longest chain with highest PoW, economic majority will ultimately decide as miners are bound to follow the chain where they get paid. Just get enough miners on board to resolutely fork and we'll have a resolution.

Yes, miners in a way "sell" on-chain transactions, when the demand is greater than supply the price go up, but it can only go up so much until people don't want to pay for it.
Long term miners will earn a lot more by including more transactions into blocks. It will also make Bitcoin faster and cheaper for users, hence also likely to increase value.
f.ex let's say your a farmer that sells milk, but your only allowed to have one cow even tho the cows are free. The price of milk is now very high, because people want to drink milk but there is only so much available.
The farmers want to increase the cow-limit to 8. Which will crash the price of milk short-term, but in the future they can sell a lot more milk.
If a bottle of milk is 4$ with the 1-cow limit, they still make twice as much money if a bottle of milk is 1$ with an 8-cow limit.
And a lot more people would be happy to drink milk when it costs 1$ instead of 4$, which might also increase the price of.. cheese? my analogy is running a bit off-track, but i think you got my point.
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:07:16
Either that or cut data weight from 4 to 2.
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:36:11
possibly, but the discount would not be enough to halt the surge of transactions, blocks would still be full and the fee would remain artificially high.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:42:25
bip149 would be developer dictatorship, where every single upgrade threatens a chain split instead of reaching consensus.
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:53:15
Still small blocks and high fee's, if it's activated i guarantee you'll still see median fee's in the 0.25$ - 5$ usd equivalent range.
Most of the community seems to be in favor of both bigger blocks and segwit, we need a compromise which includes both IMO, such as sw2mb (segwit now, HF increase in 1-2 years) or extblock (high-capacity segwit replacement, opt-in).
Since it's gone a long time already sw2mb probably falls short, so a path to sw4mb should be available. Large part of the community is reluctant to accept segwit before a post-segwit scaling compromise is reached, so we can take a break from the debate.
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:29:55
A &gt;1mb block would be orphaned, there needs to be consensus first.
Small block limit is causing Bitcoin to be centralized at large off-chain companies such as coinbase, larger limit allows more people to do decentralized on-chain transactions.
A payment network with massive fee's is not sustainable, i think the current fee's for confirmation within 3 blocks is higher than the daily wage of &gt;40% of the worlds population.
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:57:48
Agreed, but core developers won't add any future planned hard-fork to the reference code, and judging by luke's proposal don't think the capacity needs to be increased until 2024.
If we just got a 2mb flagday in 2018 in the official Bitcoin Core client, everyone would be happy. (or at least grudgingly accept)
It could be dependent on segwit activating now with 75% witness discount, then add 50% discount to non-witness data with a hardfork a year later.
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:27:34
It may not need that, at least Jihan tweeted he would "probably" signal to block covert asicboost, so i'd give it a shot.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:27:43
- It's actually a capacity reduction
- It's incompatible with legacy light clients
- No guarantee that the hard fork will happen
At a minimum the proposal has to clearly state the new witness weights and weight limit, since that is the effective block size.
segwit2mb is pretty simple really: Either increase weight limit to 8m or cut data weight from 4 to 2. THIS VERSION DOES NEITHER.
It's a terrible proposal, try again.
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:36:49
If the agreement is passed, then it's done, it can happen quickly and we'll don't need to split the chain. It can be compatible with segwit SF and even bip148.
The only difference is that the next step includes upgrading to 2mb blocks, as segwit does not provide enough capacity to reduce fee's or make Bitcoin an efficient settlement layer.
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:05:13
The timeout is now 2 weeks. Core changed the code without really any public discussion or announcement.
This is the problem with the Blockstream take-over of Bitcoin Core, It creates a conflict of interest when developers work for a company who could profit from high-fee's.
Blockstream provides off-chain solutions, and goes out of business if Bitcoin transactions are fast and cheap/free, with low risk of double-spend 0conf transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-08 22:36:20
Your idea of security is insane, what kind of attack are you expecting to encounter? as long as you can protect your private key and don't get fooled into signing a transaction giving away your coins, you are safe, and it's free.

@_date: 2017-05-17 11:49:38
Got popcorn ready, just bummed it takes so long.
Bitcoin could be both decentralized and competitive with fiat transactions, but with small blocks this is not the case.
We'll need a fork to see which side actually has genuine support, more accurate public information might be needed since blockstream is heavily pushing their agenda.
@_date: 2017-05-06 04:42:39
It was 30 seconds after the previous block, it takes more time to verify and build on another miners block than your own.
@_date: 2017-05-12 04:51:35
The community demands assurance and commitment from developers to enable further scaling in the future.
One suggested way was to set a flag date for a doubling to 2mb, a year or two after segwit activates.
If we discover the network is not ready for the increase when the time comes, then it can be limited as a soft-fork. 
Another possible way would be to set a date 2-3 years in the future to just remove the 1mb limit, so we can decide on a scaling solution later as soft-fork. This wouldn't remove the option to hard-fork at an earlier date if necessary.
F.ex with live production code in Bitcoin Core to remove the 1mb limit on block 600,000 or so, then that becomes a deadline to implement a soft-fork to reasonably cap the blocksize, and can be done as UASF if necessary.
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:49:29
I was sure you were talking about core developers until you said "mining centralization".
There was enough consensus to do segwit2mb, but developers went against the community and refused to add a future hardfork increase to the Bitcoin Core client.
As this client is used by the majority of full nodes, there is not going to be any upgrade.
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:14:01
Overwhelming majority want post-segwit scaling at some point in the future, so code to plan a future hardfork should be implemented as early as possible.
If the future increase is too large, it's a lot easier to limit with soft-fork later, than it is to increase with hard-fork on short notice.
Mining is what is likely to be/is dangerously centralized, lots of non-mining nodes aren't vital.
To attack Bitcoin you'll only need &gt;50% of hashrate or something like &gt;90% of nodes.
We can afford to drop a few nodes to greatly improve the usability of Bitcoin.

Exactly, segwit with code to adjust the data weight from 4 to 2 after a year or so. Nearly doubles on-chain capacity, still limited to 4mb maximum. Also a compromise weight, 50% signature discount down from 75%, makes it attractive to upgrade to new transaction format in first year, and to upgrade to schnorr signatures later.
@_date: 2017-05-12 03:25:24
Yeah that's what the comprise was supposed to be, miners said they would activate segwit when a future scaling hardfork is implemented in Bitcoin Core. So segwit could activate now, as soon as were assured there will be further scaling in the future.
So either segwit2mb, or set a date in the future to remove the 1mb limit so we can decide on a scaling solution later as soft-fork.
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:32:15
It would not be in a miners interest to make a 1gb block with 0-fee transactions, as the block would have a much larger chance of being orphaned. It would be an equilibrium blocksize and fee that develops naturally if there are no blocksize limits.
Basically it should be a fee market with mass-adaption, maybe when block reward goes bellow 1btc, not now, not before 32mb blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:34:22
It actually works as 1 satoshi = 1 vote.
You send a transaction to yourself with the version bits, and the vote counts until it's spent. So it's counting unspent amounts, not a per transaction kind of thing. If you are sending a lot of transactions and include it with all of them it could have a big impact tho. (f.ex if exchanges started doing it, which makes it a bit skewed)
@_date: 2017-05-15 07:48:12
Absolutely nonsensical.
BIP148 barely has any support, and no hashrate. There is no serious threat of any chain split from bip148, only an incredibly tiny fraction of nodes disconnecting from the network until they fix their client to accept valid blocks again.
Advocating bip148 is completely insane, do you really believe it's in the best interest of Bitcoin to disconnect more nodes or create an altcoin with almost no transaction confirmations?
I would love to see the value of the UAF coin, if an exchange opens a future trading market.
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:46:58
1) hardware wallet / offline private key
2) miner would forfeit block reward by mining an invalid block, spv verifies difficulty. you would have to accept a single confirmation for something worth more than &gt;13btc before it's any plausible risk.
a normal double-spend by reversing/reorganizing the chain one block sounds more likely, and would fool a full node too.
Are you worried miners collude &gt;50% of hashrate to steal from you or cheat? even if there were much much fewer full nodes, they wouldn't get anywhere near 100 blocks deep undetected by the entire community.
And again: double spending by block reorg is still possible against full nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-08 23:47:37
sniping is irrelevant as i didn't suggest a minimum fee.
if that kind of spam is worth capping the entire network capacity for, why didn't it happen in bitcoin or in any alt-coins with lots of free capacity?
it's fine to get a tiny fee, but the costs today are ridiculous. it can also be controlled by miners anti spam measures such as charging more to spend recent inputs.
as for security, same rule applies to light and webwallet, they can't fleece you unless they have your private key. your thinking about sybil attack, spoofing utxo? please explain how someone could attack you when using a hardware wallet and spv node (10 connections + blockchain headers)
@_date: 2017-05-01 05:20:15
Got a link to the calculation?
Capacity should be estimated in number of transactions, not size.
So if we do get 2.1mb blocks, but only 60% more transactions, that is a 60% capacity imcrease, and what sounds like a lot of waste.
The first point of the weusecoins article is already incorrect, segwit allows more signature data equal to 4 times of what you take away from the 1mb block.
so the maximum weight would be reached by f.ex 0.75mb data + 1mb signatures.
If the segwit limits were 1mb data + 3mb signatures, it would allow a lot more transactions, and this change could have been easily done.

Yeah i think we should scrap BU and use other clients to support different scaling proposals.
Running Core unpatched apparently counts as a vote for policy to keep small blocks, and high fee's.
But BU is obviously not a production ready alternative.
@_date: 2017-05-13 06:07:40
Yeah, Bitcoin Core is not going to include any future on-chain scaling.
Core roadmap ensures full blocks, massive fee's, and the only acceptable step forward is something that heavily favors off-chain tech by companies like blockstream.
@_date: 2017-05-07 05:19:33
Satoshi and others heavily indicated it. All altcoins have it so far. Every early scaling debate was about how small of a microtransaction would be viable long term, which was indicated to be somewhere between access to website content and buying a cup of coffee. Nobody warned that transactions could be anywhere near this expensive when i got into Bitcoin.
The number is of course arbitrary, but i guesstimated up to 3% fee is reasonable for transaction processing, then tried to find the worldwide average cost of a cup of coffee, which seems to be about 1.5$. *0.03 = 4.5 cents.
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:46:28
You can't base it on backlog/mempool, because every node doesn't have the same mempool/transaction set. that's kind of the whole point of the blockchain, to make the ledger the same for everyone even tho unconfirmed transactions may be different.
So the dynamic could either be a preset increase over time, adjusted by miner vote, or based on previous blocks (but this could be gamed)
i would vote for a mix where the blocksize is set linearly by height, and if miners reach supermajority it can be adjusted slightly.
f.ex set limit to blockheight X 10bytes (about 4,7mb now) then if &gt;80% of miners vote to increase over a month, it's changed by 5% to X 10.5 bytes etc.
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:44:36
Yes it could be if it succeeds, which is extremely unlikely at this point.
Keep in mind the same goes for bigger blocks, i would expect a user+miner activated soft-fork to force bigger blocks to launch at some point. (yes soft-fork to force signalling, before hard fork activation at 100% hashrate + activation time) The only question is when, how long, and how big.
If you didn't understand that, bip148 is a soft-fork to activate another soft-fork. Similarly there can be a soft-fork to activate a hardfork, called a synthetic fork.
We might even get lucky and end up with both, possibly back to where we started (segwit + 2mb compromise) just years too late.
There is no doubt that core developers, influenced by blockstream, are the ones mostly responsible for blocking a scaling solution all along.
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:33:12
sw2mb could adjust the discount or add a 4mb cap
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:29:01
The chokepoint is hash rate, not nodes. If someone controls &gt;50% of hashrate they can kill bitcoin by only mining empty blocks.
So no matter how many nodes there are, Bitcoin is still largely controlled by miners who mainly operate in large datacenters, most of which are even within a single country.
Taking down all the full nodes is impossible, even with much larger blocks there will be more than enough to decentralize the network as long as Bitcoin holds high value, and is essential to a lot of businesses.
Seriously, how would taking down ALL the nodes be easier than HALF the miners?
To support this new view of Bitcoin you postulate, you should change to an altcoin that has proof-of-stake and/or an asic-proof algorithm.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:52:10
If segwit is so popular why are less than 35% of miners signalling to activate it? and more than 40% are signalling they want to increase capacity, which is what most users really want too.
Bip148 is even less popular and dead on arrival, just see what the value of the new split coin would be if an exchange list it.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:38:59
Segwit only was rejected, a compromise has been reached and overwhelmingly accepted. But nobody is forcing anyone to be compatible, you can stay on the legacy chain if somebody mines any blocks on it, but transactions will be almost impossible to send until a difficulty adjustment is reached, which may never happen.
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:11:48
it doesn't even double it, but even if it did, it takes a long time to activate, during which only 1/3 of transactions confirm, likely more as we are already above full capacity.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:45:13
This proposal enforces the segwit weights, leave them unchanged, and caps the maximum down to 2mb.
I can tell you right now that the above proposal is an unworkable ruse and nobody is interested.
Still waiting for the real segwit2mb BIP.

@_date: 2017-05-12 18:04:23
Yeah a lot people probably wouldn't want to move their cold funds to vote, and i guess it requires sending a transaction with special parameters that lots of wallets wouldn't even support. Or could be done by using a vanity address, but then you'd have to trust your funds with whatever software generates the vanity address for you.
And obviously exchanges etc could vote with everything their holding.
But i still think it's a better idea than counting nodes, random polls, or however core developers reach consensus on which BIP's to include.
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:42:57
The code needs to be agreed on, tested, and enforced by a decisive majority of miners. The code should not have to be overly complicated, so fingers crossed it can be accomplished quickly. If 2mb scaling is set for sept21, all full nodes need to upgrade within that date.
@_date: 2017-05-01 12:36:26
1mb blocksize limit. Everybody doesn't need to run a full node, with an spv node you just need to trust that the news of miner theft would reach you. (at least one full node notifying the community)

@_date: 2017-05-15 11:08:43
Luke should just fork off and make a lukecoin with segwit, pow change, and 300kb blocks. Hopefully the blockstream developers leaves with him.
Or if we replace 300kb with 2mb+bip100, and the pow is asic-proof, then i would consider joining.
But as conv3rsion said, what would be most viable to actually fork with, is the one most people and miners agreed to, which is 2mb+segwit. Cut the witness discount from 75% to 50% to get 4mb max in worst case. Then we could have about 3x as many transactions processing and viable fee's for a while until we figure out a rational long-term scaling mechanism.
I'd say just set the block max-weight/size to a multiple of blockheight to get slow linear scaling. (f.ex height x10 bytes = 4,6mb blocks right now, which is right in the sweet spot of low-end decentralized scaling) 
@_date: 2017-05-15 15:10:19
That's true, but it can be limited to a much smaller advantage.
Ethereum isn't mined using asic's yet. I am sure it's possible to make one, but using a memory heavy pow makes asic's much more unlikely to have a decisive advantage.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:34:26
Developers should not have dictatorship status on protocol upgrades.
The more people support this reckless fork, the greater the disruption will be before it's gone.
If bip148 has 0% or very low hashrate, all nodes running it will disconnect, but Bitcoin stays the same.
If bip148 has some hashrate but less than 50%, it will cause a chain split and we'll get two kinds of Bitcoin with most people on the main Bitcoin chain, and some on the bip148 chain which will essentially be an altcoin, but without replay attack protection etc.
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:58:28
The whole point is to double capacity, which obviously doesn't happen when the limit stays at 4m and the same 1-4 weights.
There are really two options here:
Change the weight from 1-4 to 1-2 (effectively 50% discount on block data, and 75% discount on witness data, limit stays at 4m)
Or just increase the weight limit to 8m, which is a capacity doubling and what most people probably expects.
And you forgot to include the activation mechanism. As far as i know the plan is 80% hashrate to activate, which includes segwit activation. These two needs to be linked by the same activation, IMO it should be a syntethic fork, where all blocks not signalling both segwit AND 2mb fork will be rejected after the proposal is locked in.
By the way, the agreement was to fork in 6 months, not 18 months.
@_date: 2017-05-12 01:29:43
Yeah if we could. i'd propose some kind of simple linear growth, like blockheight * 10
(4.7mb if forked now, slow and steady growth)
But 95% of the community is not going to magically agree with that or any other proposal, which is why it's kinda just split into 1mb-forever+segwit vs bigger blocks.
segwit+2mb was a reasonable compromise, once upon a time.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:50:46
Small blocks imperil the system's security long term when block reward is reduced, people don't want to spend 100$ to open a channel or peg.
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:39:57
Exactly, smaller blocks might make it a bit easier for some more people to run a full node, but it does nothing to limit mining centralization.
More importantly small blocks make it extremely hard to actually use bitcoin. (sending transactions on-chain) which is pretty damn important.

You still do not understand what i suggested AT ALL, and i am not going to explain it again here.
How is bitcoin going to expand, especially in countries with low wages, when it costs more than a day's or even week's salary to send a single transaction?
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:32:58
They would grudgingly accept such a small capacity increase, and then we'd have a real possibility of segwit activation.
It would be a major relief of all parties in the bitcoin ecosystem, directly to the benefit of bitcoin and everyone using it.
We'll do better without a few old raspberry pi's and shared hosting nodes anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:05:32
The cap can stay at 4m, but change the weight on blockdata from 4 to 2.
So we'll have 50% instead of 75% discount on signature data.
That should be reasonable with future schnorr signatures, which will then have a bigger impact on transaction weight.
And there will be 75% discount for the first year which incentivize transition to the new transaction format.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:27:03
This. Although running bip148 would still just disconnect you from the network unless miners and market suddenly goes along with it.

Hence the quotes, although pretty sure he said that when he thought another capacity increase would be implemented in Bitcoin Core in the near future.
Either way, give miners a chance to block asicboost.
Any chance we can see a (non-segwit) covert-asicboost-block SF in Bitcoin Core soon? Or is that contentious among devs?
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:04:48
Blocks just got completely full, and were not done yet. Additionally Bitcoin value could rise quickly while fee's denominated in btc stay the same:
Average daily income in sub-saharan Africa excluding south-Africa, is less than 2$/day, which is already less than the average Bitcoin transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:19:47
I don't know why it's taking that long to verify the last block and construct the new block to build on top, but it needs to be built without using any of the inputs used in the received block, or breaking any other rules.
When a miner receives a new block header, they could compete with their previous block to try to orphan it, but it's very unlikely to happen, so they make more profit by immediately starting to mine an empty block (which won't break any rules) until they can download and verify the block they received and construct a new valid block on top.
It does seem suspicious that they don't put more resources into doing this faster, with all the high transaction fee's, and thin or xthin blocks available. But other miners such as slush mentioned above who signal segwit does make empty blocks in the beginning as well.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:24:37

The current extension block proposal is a modification of segwit, so they are not compatible with each other.
EXTBlock has the same benifits as segwit and can provide much higher capacity, at the cost of not giving old nodes access to the transactions within in the ext block, and there may need to be a delay when moving funds out of the ext block.
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:48:43
The question is which chain should be called 'Bitcoin'
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:50:10
This is interesting,
So i think Bitcoin Core is clearly centralized when you are presented with a 1-person reference point (mail Luke-jr) to submit proposals.
Very few people with commit access, and contentious changes are implemented on a whim by a couple developers, such as:
- Replace by fee
- Default time to keep a transaction in mempool extended from 3 to 14 days.
Not to mention when a single company employs most of the prominent developers, and market+user consensus is not reflected in the code.
I would say mining is centralized if behavior of &gt;50% hashrate can be micromanaged/bought to do soft-forks quickly and undisclosed to the public.
f.ex if countries/corporations were able to enforce soft-fork changes for a fee, such as blocking funds from certain addresses from being spent or even something that sounds positive such as 2 way pegs / extension blocks for private interests.
Just the fact that we are still stuck in a scaling deadlock, also seems to indicate decentralization/independence.
@_date: 2017-05-07 07:30:00
Nodes have neither consciously nor voluntarily dictated the 1mb limit.
Users should have had the ability to coordinate the blocksize limit. But were stuck with a temporary anti-spam measure, completely inflexible and arbitrary, enforced by developers who may arguably be more centralized than miners.
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:11:57
small blocksize limit creates a forced fee market, a real fee market would develop naturally over long periods of time with unlimited blocksizes.

They are signalling the segwit2x hard fork, and pushing it quickly with an early segwit avtivation to avoid a bip148 chain split, and as good faith that the community will upgrade and stay in consensus.
All full nodes need to upgrade within 3 months after segwit2x locks-in.
It may be a chain split late october if the legacy chain still has significant support.
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:17:10
It's not only important for miners, new rules are in effect which can currently only be followed by the btc1 client. When the hardfork locks-in It's required to upgrade within 3 months.
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:44:22
Can you imagine how the network and mempool would be if this happened with all miners in a certain country?
If we kept larger capacity than demand, we could much more easily deal with longer block-times.
I don't think you need a datacenter to run a node with &lt;32mb blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:56:27
You obviously have no idea how Bitcoin works, the fee's are exactly the same if you send 10cents or millions of dollars.
If transactions are cheap, more people can use it. It's that simple.
Your conspiracy theory doesn't make sense, if anyone wants to control Bitcoin it's Blockstream who's business is to provide off-chain transactions, so it's easy to see how they could have a conflict of interest, since they profit from high transaction fee's.
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:21:42
the 1x part may not happen, since 100% of hashrate signalled NYA (2x hf)

It boils down to the question of who have the authority to dictate consensus rules, the answer might be obvious as either everyone or nobody.
If it's nobody then no soft or hard fork can ever really be done. A solid stalemate continues indefinitely, and neither bigger blocks nor something like segwit can ever be implemented.
The answer might be everyone, as anyone is free to fork the chain at any time, and their merit will ultimately be decided by the market.
Some people say multiple forks is an advantage, while others say the value of Bitcoin comes from first mover advantage and brand recognition.
The main question is which side will be entitled to the Bitcoin name: the longest chain, the highest valued chain, the longest chain compatible with the oldest client, or whichever chain is compatible with the latest bitcoin core client.
I would say it's definitely not that last one, as developers can not be entitled to dictate consensus rules.
I would say the top contender is simply the longest (heaviest pow) chain, as that is the consensus which Bitcoin is built on. And miners are pretty much bound to put most work into the highest valued chain long-term.
In this case, all clients including Bitcoin Core simply need to adapt to follow the consensus chain.
I would say segwit2x is rushed, but it's really the compromise we have all been waiting for, it has major community support, and the best solution IMO would be to unite to accept it.
The arguments against it from both sides really boils down to FUD. It's less risky than bip148, it's not going to destroy decentralization, and it's not going to be patented or within any organizations control.
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:41:13
With less than 50% hash rate, this option causes a contentious minority chain split.
Keep in mind it currently has 0% - Other options with greater community support should be added, particularly segwit2mb, bip100, emergent consensus and extension blocks comes to mind.
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:02:28
Majority of people want bigger blocks, how should scaling beyond segwit be signaled?
@_date: 2017-05-06 05:56:07
With the current mix of transactions, if they all changed to segwit transactions, how many more transactions by number would fit in each block?
Or if you take the last 1000 blocks which are &gt; 999000 bytes, and convert all transactions to the segwit format, how many segwit blocks would you need to fit them all?
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:43:27
Why is forking the chain with bip148 any better?
Having an exchange list bip148 tokens would be helpful to see where the economic majority is.
@_date: 2017-07-07 08:28:58
Segwit by itself was clearly rejected by the network, as it only ever had about 30% signalling. People switched software or refused to install newer bitcoin core versions to avoid it.
Asicboost can and should be blocked by a seperate soft-fork, Jihan even stated he would support it.
But most importantly, an agreement to activate segwit with an additional doubling of capacity has already been reached. When activated the Bitcoin network will have half of the transaction capacity that litecoin currently have.
The bottleneck is the Bitcoin Core client. The maintainers have no intention of adopting the new consensus rules, which will very likely cause a painful network split in about 4 months.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:48:46
Yeah something like that, i don't mind bip148 with &gt;75% hashrate, it's the lack of minimum hashrate and a chain split which is extremely troubling.
It should be developed a new bip that works something like this:
- set a block signal bit to support sw2mb
- at 75% of last 1000 blocks: lock in
(cancelled if &lt;75% before sept1st)
- at aug1st (or when locked in), signal segwit and reject all blocks not signalling sw2mb.
- at june1st 2018, double capacity to allow atleast 2mb of non-witness data (weight can be adjusted to 4mb max total or 8mb max total with up to 4mb non-witness data)
Because ALL blocks are signalling sw2mb there is 0% hashrate trying to mine a 1mb maximum chain when the hf capacity increase activates.
@_date: 2017-05-20 07:40:44
They say they will support the option of following the bip148 chain if there is a chain split, please stop pushing for a minority fork, we should unite supporting a majority segwit+2mb fork instead.

Timestamp documents? source?
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:24:44
Nobody is obligated to do anything, but miners signalling segwit2x are expected to run the code they are signalling for.
If it's run by 90% of hashrate, the legacy chain only has 10% of capacity after the fork, for up to 5 months until the next difficulty adjustment. While the 2x chain would have 180% of capacity (90% x2)
I don't see why the economic majority would prefer the unusable legacy chain, so it's likely to die off.
@_date: 2017-07-05 06:46:43
Users and economic supermajority. Check the facts on sites such as coin.dance, and look at the block headers to see what the network consensus is.
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:26:02
A hardfork to increase base blocksize by another 1mb one year after segwit actives could be a viable compromise. If this is to be done, core developers would have to be on board to implement this code asap, which they aren't.
A large group of developers calling the shots in Bitcoin Core are working for blockstream, a company who's sole purpose of business is to facilitate off-chain transactions.
Cheap and plentiful on-chain transactions in Bitcoin could make their company obsolete.
This is not to make accusations or spread FUD, just saying a conflict of interest is possible, and i am not denying that any other parties are likely to have conflicts of interest as well.
It should be added that an upcoming delayed hard-fork increase could be cancelled with a soft-fork, if the increase or fork is deemed dangerous or unnecessary.
As far as i know, the remaining plausible options, which are unlikely to be viable until next year, are: extension blocks, hardfork without segwit, or UASF.
I think many people would agree that any of the above is better than 1mb forever.
While not yet production ready, extension blocks are likely to get my warmest support, as it allows struggling nodes to stay with 1mb to help decentralize the main chain.
Keeping the main chain intact at 1mb allows it to be used for high value transactions, cold storage of large amounts etc. And can still be completely verified with our smallest computers such as raspberry pi.
Transactions on the 1mb chain will stay expensive, but have more capacity as people upgrade to utilize the extension block. If you don't trust the security of the extension block, nobody is forcing you to use it.
The additional extension block could be much bigger, supporting many many times more transactions at a much lower fee. It also includes the malleability fix, and won't split the chain as long as miners are on-board.
This also means f.ex lightning can be implemented on top of the extension block, making it a lot cheaper to open and close channels, and we'll have a much better chance of mass-adoption.
@_date: 2017-05-01 08:03:03
BU is just giving users the option to vote on and accept/enforce customized blocksize limits.
A hardfork change to 2mb or bip100 is a plausible course of action, but requires community consensus.
Were obviously divided on this issue, and neither side wants to split the chain into different kinds of coins.
There is likely to be a long warning period before anything that could split the chain such as uasf/2mb/bip100 is attempted, and hopefully the winning chain will be obvious before it happens.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:28:39
bip148 doesn't enforce bip91, the btc1 client does.
Scaling Bitcoin is not meaningless, but the 3 month activation window is a bit on the short side, so it's critical that nodes upgrade quickly.
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:06:47
Everybody signed up for the inflation/deflation schedule, nobody signed up for 1mb blocks forever. There will never be consensus to change coin issuance, but there is for bigger blocks. Either way there will be at least 3 forks this year, so we'll find out what's what. I think bcc+sw2x will have higher combined value than the legacy 1mb chain after november, but we'll see.
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:37:08
Increasing the blocksize is desperately needed and great for Bitcoin, both now and long term.

@_date: 2017-05-14 11:57:37
Really need a scaling solution asap. Segwit is very unlikely to activate this year, but the tothemoon extension block proposal could be viable in a few months, which is likely to have greater support among miners without risking a fork. Providing cheap transactions between everyone who upgrade.
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:00:41
It makes sense that it should be based on the same chain (at least the same genesis block) and have the same coin issuance (half block reward roughly every 4 years, 21 million coins total) other than that it's arguable. If ethereum was started as a bitcoin fork with the same previous chain and coin issuance, it could be argued that it's actually Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:47:10
It doesn't matter, practically every block is marked with /NYA which means they all intend to hardfork to double the blocksize.
BTC1 is the segwit2x reference client, and that proposal just locked in.
@_date: 2017-05-06 04:24:42
That's exactly what we wanted and now desperately need. Segwit SF now, as soon as HF code is released in bitcoin core to further increase on-chain capacity in 1-2 years.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:45:49
Nice coincidence :) now we just need all nodes to upgrade to avoid a mess when this hardfork activates.
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:07:06
I imagine the block after each cut-off point needs to include a verified balance sheet with the end-balance on all used addresses from all previous transactions, could that work?
lets say every 10,000 blocks it includes the balance of every bitcoin adr ever used, then each node could store 20 or 30k blocks and still be fully secure? question is how big that balance sheet block would have to be, and i am probably missing something :P
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:00:48
Before, then you get both chains. (withdraw from exchange before aug 1st) But very hard to predict what the price of each chain will be after, could cause a price dip where the combined value is lower than now, which makes it a better deal. But who knows.
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:33:08
I am still waiting for future bip148 tokens to be listed on an exchange, then you might see how bad of an idea it is.
Most of the community and miners already support larger blocks, we don't specifically need segwit to fix this:
@_date: 2017-05-08 22:06:17
No broadband in your country? use vps or pool together a full node with a few ppl you trust if you want to verify the whole chain, otherwise just run an spv node.
Excess capacity would allow transactions to process instead of dropping, even LN needs an on-chain channel, what if the channel fee is too low and can't confirm?
Fee per transaction doesn't add anything to security, only the total block reward, so double capacity and half fee's provide the same incentive/protection.
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:02:27
Yes, segwit2x will deploy over the next few months, let's hope it all goes smoothly. It's critical that all important nodes upgrade to segwit2x compatible clients.

It's called fee sniping, and it would be solved by larger blocks. Now why would they accept transactions at lower fee's? maybe they get paid more to ensure stability because there is a large risk of funds getting locked up in the mempool for at least 2 weeks?
bip100 and others were ready, Core developers alone pushed a complicated solution to fix another problem which didn't really need to be solved yet. segwit2mb was agreed to as a compromise. Core refused, and now were stuck until we can scale without their support.
(f.ex: extension block, rootstock, emergent consensus)
Worst case scenario we are stuck until we can scale without support from neither Core or Miners, which is going to be a nightmare.

I'll celebrate when 2x activates in October :)
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:11:40
They are signalling segwit2x. The new signal on bit4 marks both segwit and 2mb hardfork activation.
It was made compatible with the old version of segwit and even bip148 (if activated in time) as an act of good faith.
When locked in, the btc1 client with segwit2x becomes the new Bitcoin core reference client. Old nodes without segwit2x code or the right configurations have 3 months to upgrade before being disconnected from the network.
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:52:10
The client developers aren't in charge of protocol consensus changes. BIP91 locked in with all miners opting to signal "NYA" in the coinbase transaction to mark their support for segwit2x.
There is community consensus (majority of users, miners, businesses, exchanges, etc) to activate both segwit and the 2x hardfork. There will always be people who disagree, but to say this was all decided by a few guys from china is plain wrong. All mining pools all over the world have unanimously decided on this path forward.
The bitcoin core implementation doesn't have any code to deal with segwit2x, segwit2x hardfork will be activated using the btc1 client, which is now the new bitcoin protocol reference client.
All full nodes need to update to follow the longest chain. There is unlikely to be enough hashrate to sustain the backwards-compatible 1mb chain, so everyone who are unhappy about the new consensus likely has to fork-off with new POW or changed difficulty.
The part of the community that are strongly against segwit will fork off on august 1st with the Bitcoin ABC client (Bitcoin Cash), and i suspect another group of people who are strongly against bigger blocks will fork off with another client in november (Luke-coin?), bringing the total number of Bitcoin versions to 3.
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:18:08
What part of that wouldn't work exactly? What would other possible steps be for a sw2mb proposal to activate? Not really sure i trust your technical expertise when you are so blatently wrong about bip148 tho.
The rest of the community and miners are not likely to be intimidated by a sybil attack from a minority of nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:46:40
That's not what i meant, just that it should be viable to do reasonably small transactions, and a guess/estimate would be that transactions fee's should not exceed around 5 cents when converted to current usd value.
Blockspace was not originally intended to be limited, the 1mb limit was to prevent early obvious spam blocks, at a time when the average blocks were minuscule. It should not have been kept that low this long.
I am not against having a fair limit to guard against dangerous centralization. Bitcoin probably doesn't need gigabyte blocksizes, somewhere between 4-32mb at this time would have been enough to keep growing merchant acceptance and prevent imprisoning small UTXO.
We can move to things like lightning, extension blocks and sidechains in the future when they are ready and proven to work practically, but it should not be the first step at the expense of making the network barely functional without it.
1mb+segwit is unlikely to even be enough for a large value settlement network IMO.

bip 91 is only a small part of segwit2x, which has now locked in. There is overwhelming consensus to hard fork, with 99% of blocks signaling to do so.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:30:27
Same reason they might support a 1mb chain above a 2mb chain: Because it's a new chain with different rules than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:20:36
If miners renege on enforcing bip91 on time so it has less than 50% of hashrate. Bip148 nodes would follow the non-bip91 chain until august, and then the bip148 chain (if any) is at risk of reorganization from the bip91 chain.
Currently every single block is marked with NYA intention, clearly the best and least disruptive path forward would be to accept consensus and merge segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:57:24
Segwit2x is locked in, 100% of miners signalled 'NYA' when it did, which means the hard-fork is on track to be activated with no dissent, meaning there won't be any blocks on a legacy chain. Even if some miners change their mind, it's unlikely to be a viable legacy chain.
Incompatible clients will practically disconnect from the blockchain.
How do you suggest to measure non-miner support? I haven't seen any major business refuse segwit2x, and any coin votes done are heavily favoring larger blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-08 03:17:37
Because of segwit2x, which demands bit1 signalling in a similiar way as bip148. I think that choice of activation was a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:18:52
There has already been more than enough debate, they are now signalling compatibility with the hard-fork, and there is no going back after it locks in.
One or two pools may be fake-signalling, but i have no doubt that the majority hashrate, large buisnesses, and the silent majority are happy to support the segwit2x hard-fork.
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:53:35
This is not new, Bitcoin Aliens / Bitcoin Game Apps have been paying out 5-10BTC a week for over half a year already:
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:02:06
99% is not overwhelming consensus?
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:14:59
bip148 was just made useless, segwit is going to activate, and so is 2x.
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:42:02
Doesn't make sense to me either, why signal segwit2x if they don't want it?
Enforcing bip148 and then hardfork to 2x after 3 months would be the same as segwit2x.
To get 2mb no-segwit, they should reject bip91, let bip148 fork-off, then publicly plan a hardfork to protect against chain-reorganization risk and add 2mb max blocksize.
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:40:11
I think you are spot on about what would happen after segwit. The congestion remains, with fee's increasing and more transactions not confirming. But even after &gt;50% of all transactions have converted to using segwit with 5$ fee's, people will say:
"the blocks are only 1.3mb!"
 "were only using 30% of capacity!"
"Post a few bitcoin collateral to open an experimental lightning channel with the paypal 2.0 hub, then you can send a million transactions to X,Y or Z for the next 30 days, at the cost of only 10 standard transactions. Just remember to put a high enough fee when you close the channel with the b-whatever command line tool on this specific date"
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:01:09
It's definitely locked in, with 99% of today's blocks signalling intention to fork.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:50:24
Sorry segwit2x cancelled all the fireworks, it would have been interesting to see what would happen if bip148 forked off.
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:19:07
Transactions are almost free at this time, great opportunity to consolidate outputs, or sort out your own coins between your wallets, as long as those wallet(s) have a fee setting.
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:16:36
Because Bitcoin would be viable for all but the smallest transactions if it was allowed to scale. The median fee should never have passed the equivalent of 4-5cents.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:18:05
I support big blocks and thought the UAHF initiative was idiotic as well, especially now when segwit2x is pretty much guaranteed to happen.
But unfortunately the differences within the community are too great to reconcile.
They are simply forking now to avoid segwit altogether, and no one can force them to use a chain with rules they do not approve. The POW difficulty will adjust with Bitcoin ABC, so the chain is not going to die, It will probably just be much lower valued than the main chain.
Similarly i suspect small blockers to fork-off to avoid the 2x increase in November, either by suffering through on a very slow legacy chain or by changing POW to make another kind of Bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:21:50
Bitcoin has a consensus mechanism. Just follow the longest most-work chain. Don't let either side trick you with propaganda or fud to follow the minority chain if a fork happens.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:44:55
Only 3 more blocks until segwit2x lock-in!
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:54:18
It's the only measurable consensus mechanism, and as far as i know, no major businesses or economic entities have outright rejected segwit2x, while large portions are in favor.
If miners fork as signaled (&gt;90%) it's very likely to go smoothly without a viable legacy chain remaining.
Bitcoin Core are not supposed to make consensus decisions on behalf of the community. If it's still going to be the reference client, it simply needs to be updated to reflect the new consensus changes.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:30:07
Troll proposal that would probably reduce the blocksize, just ignore it.
@_date: 2017-06-25 07:11:37
Core needs to follow consensus and implement segwit2x which has &gt;85% hashrate support, as well as major economic and community support. It's compatible with bip148 if activated before August 1st.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:52:56
Hello segwit2x! :) Today also saw 99% of blocks signalling NYA intention, which means the 2x hardfork is guaranteed to be on track.

A couple old ones:
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:00:15
This is spot on, adding more highways as gps technology becomes cheaper would be good, and i wouldn't trust the experimental teleportation to solve all our problems. We still need more highways so the gateway carts aren't badly congested anyway.
@_date: 2017-07-08 09:30:09
Yeah that makes bip148 users and everyone else follow along until the hardfork point, increasing the chanse of a strong split away from segwit2x in November.
It would be a lot better to re-deploy segwit together with hardfork preparation on bit4, this would disconnect bip148 users from the network on aug1st (which could still happen tho) and everyone else who wants to utilize segwit would be required to upgrade, increasing the chanse of sw2x hardfork adoption.
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:52:33
You can have proof that your transaction was in fact included in a block using an SPV node without trusting anyone else.
With an SPV node you may want to be more careful with few transaction confirmations, such as 0 or 1 confirmations. But Bitcoin is not secure without multiple confirmations anyway.
You just need to trust that &gt;50% of hashrate is honest, which is also true if you are running a full node anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:14:01
Yeah i know it's possible to split coins eventually, but you can't expect an exchange to have it ready within an hour, it takes at least some time to do.
I think .1 is a bit low, 10% ROI is barely worth the risk of having coins on an exchange when (and locked until) this happens IMO.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:26:56
Nice to see segwit2x is finally on track, should have been done over a year ago.
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:55:35

@_date: 2017-06-05 05:18:39
Default option for everyone running current versions of Bitcoin Core would be to defect and only activate half of the agreement.
Changing the bit would at least make defection a concious/active decision.
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:45:43
bip148 won't have any effect if segwit2x activates, you need a bip91 compatible client like btc1 to correctly verify blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:31:50
This march??? Well yeah BU did increase to about 40%. But the debate has been going for years, and it could possibly still go on for several more years.
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:46:16
Checked BitMex, they only have big blocks and segwit (binary bet, if it's live on the longest chain this year or not)
Currently big blocks are about 38% likely, and segwit is about 64% likely to happen this year according to market bets on that exchange.
If segwit2x is successful with 3 months HF activation they will both win.
SW2x increased the possibility of compatibility, but only if development is on schedule, and actually gets above 80% hashrate very quickly.
Personally i would bet on the proposals still failing this year, (continued gridlock, 1mb no-segwit) I don't think neither segwit2x nor bip148 are all that likely to happen.
@_date: 2017-06-16 08:16:20
bip148 coins will be worthless unless segwit2x is a success and deployed in time to be compatible. I'd likely trade a bit if a reliable future option was available on a major exchange, but there would have to be a major reward far above 0$ because i don't want to have coins locked up at any exchange, especially on aug1st.
@_date: 2017-06-16 08:01:40
That's probably why it's going to fail, the only way to compromise is if both sides get something they want. Activating segwit and relying on good-faith from the rest of the community to follow the hardfork is unlikely to be supported by miners.
Clients should upgrade to support segwit2x, so upgraded clients both get segwit and follow the hardfork. This unfortunately means bip1 deployment of segwit cannot be used, unless segwit is activated after the hardfork.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:42:33
The faith of the bip148 chain will hopefully be decided quickly, i don't think a large amount of hashrate wants to sustain a split.
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:42:42
Yeah had to read that twice, and that's the ONLY pair they launch with?
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:23:01
Some would, there just isn't any exchange offering the future token pair.
You can't trade without trusting a third party to hold your coins. To trade f.ex 1 bip148 coin for 1$, you'll need to trust an exchange with a whole Bitcoin, which is not at all worth the risk or even enough to cover the transaction fee to send it back and forth.
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:32:08
If it matters, Satoshi was clearly in favor of much bigger blocks. (nodes only in big datacenters and gigabyte blocksizes)
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:57:28
The proposal currently does not honor the agreement in the way that the majority of participants understood it. As explained here: 
Saying it can do or be changed to pretty much anything, such as bip103 (your link) indicates the agreement is not understood at all.
In addition to not doubling the blocksize, there are still debates everywhere against any hard fork at all. Even recommendation to dishonestly pretending to be part of the consensus but then pull out after segwit activation, which is exactly what the core client would do, unless we change the activation bit. Because the core development team would have a hard time arguing that their client should follow segwit activation on the hardfork activation bit without activating the hardfork.
So it doesn't make sense to assume good faith that the entire community will upgrade and join the hardfork after segwit is activated. There is no need to have replay-protection if we do, and there is every justification for incompatibility with the existing segwit deployment approach.
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:14:20
Do you support hardfork to double capacity 6 months after segwit activation? even if it's not implemented in Bitcoin Core? Core developers have said they can't implement any conensus changes even if it has wide support, so it has to be done with an alternate client.
@_date: 2017-06-17 09:32:22
How about doing it the other way around? Allow Bitcoin to scale and implement a decentralised drivechain with a tiny blocksize that every raspberry pi can verify.
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:25:13
Please explain the wording of the agreement and what you believe the 2mb part is supposed to do, if not double the capacity. As i said if the point is to add an additional max 2mb blocksize limit, that could be done as soft-fork, no hardfork needed.
Currently the sketched proposal does not double capacity, that's not to say the proposal couldn't still be changed. But if you read here you can see where it's going: 
Upping the blocksize beyond signature discount does not seem to have a lot of developer support, and the general consensus so far is to signal on bit 1 to be compatible with the current segwit deployment, which will make defection the default choice and brake the agreement.
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:00:16
Another 2-5 years then? More than uncomfortable enough already.
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:03:47
I hear you, miners have protected the sovereignty and secured the chain for years, while developers have a conflict of interest caused by companies infiltrating the team. But a compromise between both sides is necessary to resolve the gridlock, so it's worthwhile to understand both perspectives and not get caught up in group-mentality.
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:11:58
Upgrading to btc1 is required for all full nodes. Bitcoin Core does not yet support segwit2x, so it won't know if a block is invalid under the new rules, and it won't accept new blocks or follow the longest chain when the hardfork activates after 3 months.
@_date: 2017-06-04 06:43:10
But minimal disruption is to just ignore it.
It's only people running bip148 who fork themselves off the main chain.
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:21:18
Double capacity, hence '2x'. Segwit by itself changes the limit from 1mb to a 4mu maximum block weight, segwit2x hardfork doubles it to 8mu.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:11:39
The witness discount stays the same.
Segwit changes the maximum size from 1mb (1 million bytes) to 4mu (4 million weight units), segwit2x simply doubles the cap to 8mu, which is effectively making the new base size 2mb. (and with segwit transactions they can be larger, just like 1mb+segwit blocks can be larger)
It's critical that hardfork code is ready and distributed in advance, so clients have time to upgrade. Preferably this should have been a year or two in advance, and in the Core reference client.
But core refuses to do so, and demands consensus changes be done with alternate clients. Patience have run out, so now everyone has to patch their nodes to follow the consensus chain, with very limited time to do so.
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:54:08
The only expensive infrastructure needed to mine are the asic's themselves, which are almost exclusively produced by bitmain anyway.
even small players can afford an unlimited &lt;5mb/s connection and a terrabyte or two of additional storage now and then, it's only hobby/pi nodes that might possibly struggle with &gt;8mb blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-18 05:12:26
No you could use the same xfer-out peg mechanism used in sidechains on an extension block, such as the soft-fork miner vote mechanism described for drivechains, which is a soft-fork to verify the vote requirements, not the sidechain or extension block itself.
Or the other way around, you could make a sidechain that is fully verified by the soft-fork.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:22:10
This? 
It could work that way, but people selling bip148 tokens would still get bip148 coins after the split, and probably 6 blocks are not enough to prepare any replay protection.
It would be better if the exchange had an option to split into IOU tokens before the split, so 1 bitcoin becomes 1 legacy bitcoin + 1 bip148 bitcoin. Then trade can be done freely between the two, someone can sell all their coins on one side to buy the other at whatever the exchange rate is.
On aug1 the exchange should halt withdrawals immediately to see what happens initially with the split, if there is no chainsplit for f.ex 12 hours, the fork can be assumed cancelled and withdrawals opened.
- If all blocks signal segwit, bip148 tokens is converted to Bitcoin and legacy tokens goes to 0.
- If there are any non-segwit signalling blocks but no split, the legacy tokens are converted to Bitcoin and bip148 tokens goes to 0.
If there is a sustained split with f.ex 6+ blocks on each side, all bitcoins on the exchange should be split into legacy and bip148 tokens.
In this case withdrawals has to stay closed until replay attacks can be avoided. Alternately Bitcoin could potentially be withdrawn by subtracting from both balances.
Fee's would likely be very high, especially on the bip148 chain (as it has to have the minority hashrate when there is a sustained split)
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:52:27
I like the road analogy, i believe it goes something like this however:
- Increasing the blocksize would be like building more lanes.
- Activating segwit allows smaller electric cars on the road
- Lightning network is like putting buses on the road
If we get people to switch from using their cars to taking the bus, the road capacity could clear up, but taking the bus is likely to be a bit inconvenient. We may also end up with different kinds of buses going in different directions (different sidechains, extension blocks etc)
F.ex if you want to go to bob, he might not have a lightning bus-stop nearby, perhaps he only has a rootstock station.
While not the most efficient, at least with the good old car, they can park anywhere, and could get anywhere on an average of 10minutes if the road wasn't congested.
We'll end up with a mix and more of all kinds of things on the road, that's not a bad thing, but i firmly believe adding an additional lane or two should be encouraged as well.
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:29:01
You neither said anything nor refuted anything i said, your obviously a troll and i'll stop feeding you now.
@_date: 2017-06-03 18:47:57
How so? I am sure we can agree the agreement should have been specified more clearly.
- Roger Ver think it means to hardfork to 2mb first, then activate segwit later.
- Luke jr think it means to cap the max blocksize down to 2mb with no change of the segwit weights.
Pretty sure it meant to bundle segwit with an additional doubling of maximum blocksize.
Which is what changing the max weight from 4m to 8m would do. And this needs to be activated with the same bit/code that activates this version of segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:39:55
Definitely. It's a real solution with major support.
Unlike f.ex bip148 which is more like a terrorist threat from a minority.
If you want increased capacity, decentralization and malleability fix, segwit2x is what you want to vouch for.
It has greater hashrate support than both segwit and bitcoin unlimited combined, everyone running a full node needs to update to segwit2x by november or become disconnected from the network.
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:09:09
No wonder we can't get the proposal done in time when developers are trolling. (not just the example above, but prominent developers as well)
It's really obvious what the segwit2x proposal is supposed to do:
- Set a new activation bit: bit4 for both segwit and hardfork, which locks in both at &gt;80% hashrate. All nodes must upgrade to utilize segwit and be part of the hardfork.
- Make the hardfork double capacity: all limits must double, especially the weight limit which must be increased from 4m to 8m.
So far developers seems to have decided on behalf of themselves to make the proposal:
- Activate segwit at current bit
- Forget about the HF, but if there is any make it reduce capacity instead.
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:41:50
The security is the same whatever amount you send.
How exactly would you fool someone running an SPV node into seeing 6 confirmations on an invalid transaction?
Full nodes only really make 0conf slightly safer, which is not safe anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-05 05:24:21
The exchange might not have the capability of sending coins on a single chain after 6 blocks, because bip148 has no replay protection.
If reorg never happens, bip148 loses, that's why i want to sell my bip148 tokens also.
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:43:03
That's incorrect, Bitcoins would still be stored on the main chain somewhere designated for the sidechain, and majority hashrate needs to enforce the two-way peg rules, otherwise they could be stolen.
There is no security difference between an extension block and a sidechain.
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:20:45
Already read it. It doesn't bundle the activation, and instead of increasing the maximum weight, it limits the blocksize with a new 2mb cap.
So Calvin Rechner misunderstood the Silbert Agreement in the same way that Luke Jr did.
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:26:53
Sounds like common sense, but is it really true?
It's a two way peg between two chains, both chains can see transactions coming in and out from a chain they haven't fully verified.
Why does it matter which layer is the "base" ?
You can fully verify all transactions within the decentralized top layer for extra security, and leave the base layer for digital cash as intended.
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:18:25
The article is simplified and non-technical.. but i agree that they should have attempted to explain it. 8mb would also be a misrepresentation however. They would have needed to explain block weights in that case.
@_date: 2017-06-05 08:46:15
By "use segwit transactions" i meant to opt-in by utilizing or enforcing segwit in any way, which covers all miners, nodes and light clients.
All developers that implement bit4 signal or segwit2x in their software, must be aware that it activates a hardfork, so not implementing the full/correct code is malicious behavior.
It would be reasonable to expect that clients checking bit4 activation to enforce or utilize segwit2x should also be compatible with the hardfork, with bit1 that is not the case, this is my whole point.
Two questions:
Would all current clients need to be upgraded before they can send segwit transactions if segwit activates on bit1?
Got a link explaining the p2p layer problems? I imagine it would be the same topology/situation as when Bitcoin Core version 0.13 was first released.
Segwit2x must be opt-in as a seperate bip, if there is a collision with legacy segwit activation, it can either be ignored as both won't activate anyway, it can be fixed with a work-around, or worst case delayed until current segwit activation expires in November.
@_date: 2017-06-18 02:53:28
By that definition there can never be an optional/opt-in soft-fork, because all soft-forks by definition invalidate blocks that unupgraded nodes would confirm as valid.
Any soft-fork would take away the full-node status of all nodes that don't enforce those rules.
As far as unupgraded nodes are concerned, there is no difference between a sidechain two-way peg and an extension block two-way peg.
The same mechanism allowing a drive-chain peg, could also be done for an extension block peg.
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:08:29
It's absolutely necessary, otherwise the default option by f.ex using the core client - would be to activate segwit and then defect without following the hard fork upgrade.
The whole point of the compromise is to bundle the two together.
Signalling on bit 1 is an invitation for everyone to maliciously reject half the agreement, so demanding bit 1 signalling is destructive and not moving us any closer to a resolution.
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:46:58
Why? Bitcoin Unlimited is compatible with the segwit2x chain, Bitcoin Core is not yet compatible. And they may want to signal readiness for future capacity increases beyond segwit2x as well.
@_date: 2017-06-04 06:55:23
I would very much like to see a bip148 future token to bet against you.
Bitmex has future trading on segwit activation this year tho. Not very liquid, but priced at about 50%, so you could double your bitcoin if the longest chain has segwit at the end of the year.
So you'll win if bip148 wins outright, or if there is a reorg where bip148 overwrites the main chain, or even if miners activate bip141 this year, such as through the Silbert agreement.
If there is a slow permanent chain split you won't win however, and neither does anybody really.

The cool part is that you can likely trade any of these coins now for a lot more than you could when they were minted.

There is currently no reason for segwit-only proponents to upgrade if they don't mind staying on a minuscule hashrate fork.
Segwit2x should re-deploy segwit with new activation code so old clients have to upgrade to segwit2x or manually defect with patched code to utilize it. As it is now they are just giving segwit away, and hoping that miners won't change their mind regarding the 2x part in November. It's a very strong show of good faith on their end, but as you can already see from this article and around this subreddit, the segwit-only side has no intention to follow through with the compromise.
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:54:01
How is the 2mb compromise giving any additional power to the miners? And either way, hashrate is king.
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:51:00
It was debated and Core developers seemed enthusiastic about adding a non-segwit asicboost killer soon. But it takes time to prepare and roll out safely. Miners including bitmain may be open to do so as well, as long as it's done on it's own instead of bundled with a controversial protocol upgrade.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:14:28
That data is already available, 4mb which is the effective limit of segwit2x was safe over a year ago.
The problem is Core cannot implement consensus changes, they have openly stated that the community have to run alternate software, because it can't and shouldn't be developers responsibility to determine consensus rules.
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:56:46
How many are segwit transactions?
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:55:26
That's your opinion, setting a flag day for bigger blocks or activating bip100 or bip103 would have been a reasonable and much more efficient first step, which would have allowed the time we needed for segwit and sidechains etc.
@_date: 2017-06-27 06:02:05
1. true, it's a very limited threat, i don't think sw2x should have strived to be compatible with it.
2. It promotes decentralization of Bitcoin development, the leadership structure of Bitcoin Core development is dangerously centralized.
3. They disconnect from the Bitcoin block relay network, no blocks would be found, or the ones that are will be at risk of a reorganization if any miners choose to attack it.
@_date: 2017-06-17 09:22:21
There is no reduction in security if you choose not to verify or use extension block(s) either, how or why would there be a difference?
Both allow UTXO outside the main chain and require a soft-fork to orphan blocks who brake the extblock or sidechain rules.
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:12:28
So the one thing you think i got wrong was about what the agreement meant, you should have just said so.
It's clear that most of those who signed wanted to increase capacity beyond segwit. In case you don't how segwit works, the new maximum block weight is set to 4m, which is still compatible with the 1mb blocksize on legacy nodes. But in practice blocks can be bigger than 1mb, even up to 2mb in some estimates.
So if the agreement was maximum 2mb with segwit, there is no need to hard fork at all, the reduction could be done with a soft-fork.
To increase maximum capacity beyond segwit (which is the whole point of the agreement) The weight needs to be changed. A doubling to 2mb would mean either 8m max-weight or a reduction on the data weight from 4 to 2.
That should be obvious, but you apparently didn't know this.
A discount on legacy transaction signature is handy, but does not actually increase the maximum blocksize.
Estimates already count on 100% of transactions moving to segwit, which would make the legacy discount worthless.
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:22:56
Segwit might have been enough two years ago, not today.
Apparently there are currently 0 clients compatible with sending segwit transactions when/if it activates.
And lightning etc is highly uncertain, it might just be a niche along with other sidechains such as liquid and rootstock, so even if the fee's are tiny, the recipient is not going to happy with an off-chain transaction unless they specifically support it - this would kind of be the same as sending on f.ex coinbase today, if the sender and recipient both use coinbase you can send for free.
Hopefully segwit2x goes through and actually adjusts the weights to at least double capacity post-segwit. What the proposal will actually do is still being discussed, and some developers (looking at you Luke-jr) are pushing for small blocks. (capping at 2mb so segwit can't grow to potentially 2.2mb, instead of doubling to potentially 4.4mb blocks)
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:37:00
Still? you must be new here.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:05:17
I remember Ether valuation had long periods of inverse correlation with Bitcoin, which is obviously no longer the case.
It's really not good that all cryptocurrency have linked valuation like this.
It means a fork, failure or bubble bursting on either coin would devastate the valuation of all coins simultaneously.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:05:00
You fail to realize that Bitcoin would never work if &gt;50% of miners collude, no matter what client you run they could reorganize or force empty blocks etc.
There is no reason everyone needs to run their own full node, you either trust in the Bitcoin blockchain or you don't, and having a full node won't save you.
The only way to solve a miner threat is to change PoW.
Small blocks are just making bitcoin less and less useful as peer-to-peer cash.
Lightning is experimental and uncertain, neither segwit or lightning is actively being used on f.ex litecoin.
And even if you move most transactions off-chain. Bitcoin still needs bigger blocks just to be an efficient settlement layer.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:57:04
Most likely 1 chain/coin which is incompatible with bip148.
About 10% of relay nodes (by count, which can be easily faked) are signalling bip148, but only around half of them are actually enforcing it, so only 5% of nodes would actually follow the new chain.
Much less than 1% of full node hash power is signalling bip148. Miners who have said they are in favor of UASF are more likely referring to bip149.
Segwit2x could plausibly be compatible with bip148, but developers and miners would need to act quickly, and actually follow through.
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:56:06
I just pointed it out above
- Not doubling the capacity will be seen as not honoring the agreement
- Doing segwit activation on bit 1 will be seen as not honoring the agreement
So we'll have to see if the BIP is changed to do what it's supposed to do.
If you disagree please explain yourself clearly, i am not going to reply to another troll comment.
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:36:23
If i am incorrect about anything, you can correct me instead of trolling. Here's the link to the coop bip mailing thread: 
Here's a response about reducing rather than increasing capacity: 
Please tell me what you think the Silbert Agreement means, and if you think most of the people who signed wanted to decrease the maximum allowed blocksize post-segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:06:59
Alright, i'll try to move something at less than 75 sat/b fee, fingers crossed.
@_date: 2017-06-05 05:56:15
i feel like a broken record here, how is this so hard to understand? Bit 1 activates segwit for clients who are not compatible with segwit2x, this is likely to delay/defect upgrading causing most nodes to be incompatible with the hardfork. The whole point of the agreement is to bundle the two together, if you want to use segwit transactions you'll need to upgrade, and by default that upgrade makes you compatible with the hardfork.
If Core defects and listens for segwit activation on bit 4 without being compatible with the hf, that's conciously malicious by the developers.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:52:13
No you pay for each UTXO spent, even if they were all in the same wallet adr.
@_date: 2017-06-17 05:03:22
The problem is the two way peg needs to be soft-forked in, extension block accomplishes the same and is closer to being ready, but all of this takes time and we needed bigger blocks a year ago.
What's the difference if someone gets paid from an extension block or from a sidechain? wouldn't you still consider nodes not verifying the drive/side-chain to not be real full-nodes?
Any extblock or sidechain also fixes transaction malleability and provides better support for off-chain payment channels.
Can't we just agree that 1mb forever on the main chain is not enough, and raise the maximum blocksize to at least 4mb which was researched and considered safe over a year ago?
This will give us time to develop long-term solutions, and it's only going to get harder to do any hardfork in the future.
Segwit2x could be on-track to do this, it would double base capacity and include the 75% signature discount, effectively getting us to about 3.5 - 4.5mb blocks. There is pretty much consensus to do this, but it's going to be a big mess if it's not implemented in Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:43:43
The segwit part is also controversial, otherwise it would have been activated at 95% hashrate a long time ago. But it could only get about 30%.
Segwit2x is both, and not meant to pick and choose. But they are taking a big risk enforcing bit1 activation in the same way as bip148.
As it is now, clients without segwit2x will get segwit activated and deflect from the hardfork by default.
To reduce deflection they should have activated segwit on bit4 alone, instead of being compatible with old clients. Or they could have done both at the same time.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:25:19
no i didn't, and i got tired of the blockchain syncing and taking up almost 3gb, so i uninstalled it and just uploaded the wallet.dat to blockchain.info

You haven't pointed out anything at all, how did i supposedly misrepresented either the Silbert Agreement or the hard fork proposal(s)? In what way is any of what i said above incorrect?

if you send me, i'll use it to play multiple times with smaller bets, if that's ok.
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:25:40
Sure, but it can't be the default option.
If Bitcoin Core developers rejects segwit2x that's their decision, but they can't maliciously defect by implementing half of the agreement.
I am sure such a bad-faith client would exist, but i don't see Bitcoin Core implementing it. They would have to decide to implement segwit + 2mb, or neither.
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:23:02
If you aren't mining or need to keep track of everyone else's transactions, use an SPV node. Block headers have a tiny flat size no matter how big the blocks are.
Besides the majority of miners want to limit the blocksize to 8mb anyway, there wouldn't be gigablocks for tens or hundreds of years.
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:04:27
Invited? The discussion and development is public, they are welcome to join. There are a couple core devs on there anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-29 16:05:51
Developers doesn't have the right to dictate consensus. An agreement was reached, and developers should make the code that the community wants to run. Even if they disagree with the politics they should participate to make it as safe and tested as possible within the agreed upon charter.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:39:51
well about 300 in a way, i wasn't into any of the big exchanges, so i got some through virwox (using paypal) where i had to convert to sll then btc. they take commission on every step, so i ended up with .21 for my 60$ and they take 0.01 commission on the final bitcoin transfer as well, so i just got my 0.2 today.
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:35:36
It would or at least could be reality if we just got rid of the temporary blocksize limit tho. Bitcoin would be just as decentralized (same or higher number of mining full nodes) and likely valued much higher because it would actually be useful and reliable to use as a payment network.
@_date: 2017-06-05 10:18:11
bit1 can't be used, a third p2p transport network is needed, an absolutely necessary complication as you and others are planning to scrap the hardfork and maliciously follow only half of the agreement.
If additionally an upgrade to the third p2p transport and bit4 activation is planned to be done maliciously without activating the hardfork, the compromise can't be done.
The only option then would be to activate segwit simultaneously with the hardfork, or stay deadlocked at status quo waiting for other options.
It can't be one before the other as neither side can be trusted.
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:04:45
Bigger blocks are very unlikely this year, hopefully coming next year.
The bitfinex tokens have unfair rules, such as if bigger blocks are adopted by Bitcoin Core the value goes to 0.
A more accurate token can be found on bitmex which is at 27% right now, still limited to 2017 which is why it's low/unlikely.

Thank you! i didn't notice. I changed it from normal to "frugal" and i'll see how it goes. It might still incur a small fee though, and there is still no way to tell how much, or how long it might take, until after i click the send button, which is puzzling, but acceptable i guess.
