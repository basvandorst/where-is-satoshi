Why do you even post when you don't know anything about it?
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:25:24
That's not how it works at all, the way you see it is completely wrong. Read the white paper, or just the info graphic of the post...

Jesus Christ... I normally wouldn't have a problem with ultra simplistic questions but another poster mentioned your post history so I checked it out... Fuck man... You thought you "discovered the strategy for winning tournaments" in poker then one post later didn't even understand how the game worked. Plus some racism seemingly just to ensure everyone knows you're a piece of trash. I'd normally give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but you just shouldn't be here. Nobody else is going to care either, and everyone here benefits off of having people like you giving away free money into the ecosystem. You will just give away everything to people who deserve it more. Get a job and do what you're told, sometimes that's what's best.

It's way worse than that. He posted just before that claiming to have "discovered the strategy of winning tournaments." haha, this is an all time great post for this sub.

Are you retarded?

People don't mine bitcoin for profit unless the price is surging, there's no competitive way to do it. Bitcoin is mined by large companies with access to extremely cheap electricity, using ASICS. There will always be times during prices swings that it becomes profitable for individuals, but in general it's not.

Bitcoin is functionally useless right now. It has grown faster than the tech can support due to speculative fervor and it will be possibly years before proper scaling solutions are developed, tested, and adopted. Right now, use a different coin that is less popular with speculators. I know that's lame as hell since bitcoin is the most widely recognized and accepted currency, but that's just how it is until all these get rich quick morons leave the scene or scaling solutions get implemented.

It's just segwit, segwit 2x was another attempted takeover of bitcoin. Segwit is the precursor to the solution, segwit itself only halves the fees, and only with widespread adoption.

Sovereign citizen garbage

Ya, wasn't Ver trying to change bitcoin to get a short term scaling solution? Maybe short sighted, but bitcoin has zero utility right now... Anyone who thinks that's ok is a moron.

It's just a shill, that didn't actually happen.
@_date: 2018-03-26 08:12:25
Would there be any way to time it to reduce the required ddos period?
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:59:33
Most of us do...

The scenario would be that you want to spend your bitcoins. like some sort of currency. That could be exchanged for goods.
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:42:50
And then 3 whole people in that country can make a transaction per second...

I think we need eminem to rap this...

The quantity is limited, the divisibility is not, they are completely different. You can never have a supply issue because purchasing power adjusts accordingly and you use smaller fractions. You also don't have the arbitrary inflationary effect of increases in the money supply.
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:31:49
How does the use of fractions of coins affect inflation? I'm not sure you fully understand what you're saying.
