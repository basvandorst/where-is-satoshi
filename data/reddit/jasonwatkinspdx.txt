Totally crazy, as in impossible.

Well, even with more traditional currencies you see similar adoption of alternatives given various policies. In Argentina Euros and USD are commonly used for transactions instead of local currency due to the controls. So crypto currencies wouldn't be some sort of "pure" experiment without their own novel issues, but I think that's also true of traditional currencies too. The reason I think crypto currencies can shed light is that literally anyone can launch one. So if one happens to identify and incorporate a strongly desirable monetary policy mechanism, I think that'd be pretty strong evidence useful for debate about management of traditional currencies.

Another interesting angle to this is his advice to replace human central bank decision-making with a deterministic rule that targets a constant rate of inflation: 


Peercoin is designed with a constant 1% inflation rate. I'm sure other bitcoin variants will play with this idea too. This means cryptocash competition could serve as a direct experimental lab for answering long standing questions about monetary policy, etc.

These are a smart gift (assuming bitcoin yadda yadda ...), but throw in the fun stuff too.
Source: I had grandparents that would give small certs of deposit to us on holidays when we were kids, but also something small and fun a kid understands. I enjoyed the toys then, and when I was older I appreciated the forethought as well as the clear intent to teach me something about personal finances.
