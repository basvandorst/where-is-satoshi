My plan is to just put in about $50 whenever it's low enough and/or whenever i have spare money. Only have about $150 in so far, but i figure $50 every few weeks, i can afford even if it goes belly up, and i'd rather be stuck with a little bit of bitcoin than zero a few years down the road. Don't really have thousands to put in right now.

Was that a haiku?

Yea definitely don't put in what you can't afford to lose. But then again, you don't have to put in all $40k. In fact it would be terribly stupid to do so with your entire fund. But something like $5k wouldn't be insane at all. Even now. I'd be really surprised if it stops around $18k/per and doesn't go higher.

How does that impact accounting and taxes? I'm a videographer also and I'm curious

Yep. Wanted to buy a few days ago at like $9000 but didn't realize it would take so long to get setup and actually figure out how to buy some. Probably will just wait until some semblance of a dip and buy. I can afford to lose it and don't want to be sitting there in regret a few years down the road with no bitcoin

Just because she is a banker and your mother doesn't mean you should listen to her in regards to your finances. Do you believe in Bitcoin and are you fully aware that this is not a "safe" investment and are you prepared to lose any money you put into it? If yes, then make your own decisions and go for it. 
I'm sorry to say that even though I'm sure your mother and other financial people are smart, it doesn't mean that they even know what's up with crypo stuff. They could just be scared of it, and rightfully so, as a responsible investment choice, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't spend your money on it.

I'm in a Corolla so a camaro sounds pretty nice to me. But i agree they are a bit generic and fratty these days. These days US Marines might as well be issued a Camaro along with their uniforms

That wouldn't make any sense because the cost per square foot varies wildly within the same city or even street.

Dude your analogy is shit and the fact that you're reposting your own comment makes it worse.

Anything that comes even remotely close to suggesting that Bitcoin isn't blessed by Jesus Christ himself is an immediate down vote.
