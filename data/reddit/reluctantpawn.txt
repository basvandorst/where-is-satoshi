Jesus I couldn’t get through 30 seconds

Because they’ve been saying LN was almost ready for years.  I think many people are taking a “ill believe it when I see it” approach as to deployment and effectiveness

How many wallets have adopted it?  How many transactions on the network are segwit? Less a than 10 %

South Korean gov raided exchanges and some reports say they claim they are going to ban crypto trading

Ok. Play semantics with someone else.  Nobody is using it.  The same could happen with LN.

Why wasn't Segwit adopted?

Ok? So....?

Is there any chance bitcoin will ever increase block size?  Wouldn’t that create a solution and wipe out bcash as a competitor in one fell swoop?
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:23:26
As you trade and verify yourself that increases
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:12:47
The people are vile but they actually have a (short term) scaling solution.  I feel like core is just standing by while btc strangles on itself.  I don’t own any bcash for the record.

Wildly underpriced

I think it’s more likely the completely clogged mempool 2with no solution in sight, super high fees, and a competitor making tv appearances on major news channels.  I’m fucking worried.

Sounds beastly
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:24:13
Why haven’t the exchanges adopted it?
