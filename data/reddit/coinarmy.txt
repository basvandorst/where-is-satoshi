1 usd =10,000 satoshi but i measure time in seconds
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:55:08
Probably you don't spend any value reading this post, what about getting paid 1 satoshi per second or whatever amount your attention costs? 
We cannot do it with old money but it seams that bitcoin works and if you don't tell me how many bitcoins you control, tell me how many satoshi you consume, I might learn something.
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:57:19
wrong, attention = money. I could live my entire life and die poor, this doesn't mean I've got not time, just that my focus is fucked. once you develop attention you can experience way more other things than money.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:08:33
it's like going to the theater. first you need an x amount of satoshi per second to live, after you add the price of the ticket
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:55:30
check this and let's hope you understand why I use satoshi per second: 
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:52:52
I thought there are 10 times less, thank you for doing it
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:21:55
I'm doing MY BEST TO keep it around 21 satoshi per second
@_date: 2019-07-20 09:14:29
you don't own any bitcoin, probably you are able to control some satoshi
@_date: 2019-07-20 09:07:59
how come you are not able to see it, 1 satoshi = 1 second. do the math
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:40:19
if you earn $10k monthly you get about 34 satoshi per second
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:42:54
I'm looking to ruin your attention with some satoshi per second, is 1 better than nothing?
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:12:19
no they won't, everybody will stop trading their rare bitcoin for the dying tether Check bitcoinnect

@_date: 2019-07-07 21:06:11
I think you're a troll, i f not let's brink this together. 7 billion people, 28k days in average per person, 1 satoshi per day to be able to breath. are there enough?

let's assume he is right, what would happen if we discover a problem with segwit? How many bitcoin are stored on segwit, I will need to downgrade my node?

@_date: 2018-08-31 13:38:15
it's hard to connect with people if you got into this bitcoin world, at least for me it is, probably because I'm able to see them infected with the old money disease. 
it's hard to see everyone getting up in the morning and going to work

this a honest path for bitcoin adoption. place a qr code under the cap and give me small amounts of bitcoins each time I buy your water. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 18:20:01
i love it, yes we should have a special payment network to get low processing fees and don't give a fuck about the business model, really i have no problem to spend 3 times more time at work just to be able to afford it.
that's why old businesses cannot go with bitcoin, and yes, I love it.

Caravan wallet it's already doing this by using hardware wallets, I was thinking on something more simple. At the end of the day you have the hardware wallet backup written on a piece of paper, having the private key on an usb stick could be something similar when it comes to privacy.
@_date: 2019-11-12 01:20:38
installing a browser plugin that might track all your actions online and much more it's totally STUPID, no matter how much money u get paid. for those that want to dig more about it, check the bitcoin honey badger conference on youtube

are you getting paid to question that? because if you do, the inequality sucks. it might take a while for you to undestand it. yes you, i'm talking to you
@_date: 2019-11-20 00:55:43
If you don't trust your hardware you are already fucked when generating a single bitcoin address, having multiple keys, stored on multiple flash drives and combined into a multisig, might give you extra security.
@_date: 2019-03-03 09:25:24
standard, old version without segwit support

@_date: 2019-11-20 00:41:39
I was thinking on an usb stick that you can boot and build the cold storage offline.
@_date: 2019-11-20 01:37:04
time, I hope I'll be able to make use of your knowledge at a rate of 1 satoshi per second.
@_date: 2019-11-14 11:02:00
sweet, you burn 90 satoshi pe second, that's the equivalent of $0.0077. It cost you nothing to read this message if you do the math in dollars.
@_date: 2019-11-20 01:28:08
I already have a solution for this, it's not user friendly but I can manage it by myself. the idea is to build something easy for new user, so probably I will donate something is someone is interested to work on it.
@_date: 2019-11-16 15:09:37
If most of the people are use a single currency for their entire life, I think it's quite important to question more.
@_date: 2019-11-20 00:34:14
opendime is a solution for that, but you still need to trust their hardware. I think it could be easier to use old usb sticks save the private keys that will form the multisig. even if one usb is exposed, you will still need the remaining ones to be able to unlock the coins.
@_date: 2019-03-25 10:31:25
peoples should stay away of Bitrefill if they care about privacy, you really don't want your phone number to be leaked to the bad guys. you're an idiot if you use different bitcoin addresses to get paid but top up your phone with bitrefill.

why you need to wait 2 weeks?
@_date: 2019-08-11 15:56:08
I think in seconds, 1 second = 1 satoshi or more. thanks for your 5 satoshi reading this.
@_date: 2019-08-13 23:42:04
1 second = 1 satoshi, think like that
@_date: 2019-08-21 13:47:01
sure, give me 38 month of your time and I'll fix that for you
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:20:28
You're right, I might forget the a brain wallet and lose my coins. Maybe a better idea would be to use a single seed and build a multisig by using addresses from different derivation paths.... but it's still hard to remember the 12 words
@_date: 2019-10-24 22:10:59
haha, not a fan and I really think that these things need to be done by myself, I also think hardware wallets are stupid and it's more secure a multisig setup
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:55:47
haha, you really want to make my life more difficult by having to carry and secure this hardware wallet....
@_date: 2019-08-25 11:35:29
That's why u should tech them multisig.
@_date: 2019-10-14 23:27:31
it took you awhile, but it's nice to see you replying to my posts

what's your number then?
@_date: 2019-10-24 23:02:35
Based on your list it means that there are less countries in the world than people who are able to control more than 10k bitcoin. Interesting.
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:25:36
true, that's the purpose
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:53:41
I personally don't use bech32, fees are low enough to use the legacy addresses
@_date: 2019-08-01 09:55:57
I use legacy addresses, the ones starting with 1 for daily use and when it comes to cold storage, based on my research, I've decided that hardware wallets are less secure so I'm using [multisig]( 
in my opinion segwit is a useless upgrade, and I'm ignoring it.
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:28:38
that's why I was thinking to combine them into a multisig, so even if you break the password you won't be able to put them together

you might be wrong, people are already using dollars backed by bitcoin, for example [this]( 2 dollar bill is worth 0.01255073 bitcoin spendable from a multisig address. people are building their own banks and use old paper money to move value on the main chain. 
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:25:16
is pain in the ass to secure the seed and take care of the hardware wallet

@_date: 2019-02-10 21:28:54
you can use bitcoin proof of existence to build reputation on top of a network of groups that can act as exchanges, they will issue their own bills and take care of any possible counterfeiting. 
this might enable creation of new "jobs" and facilitate small amount bitcoin purchased. for example locally people are not able to purchase amounts smaller that $120 from the local kiosks. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 20:00:07
bitcoin was doing pretty good before 2015, but why people don't update and prefer to run old versions?

satoshi gave me the ownership on the main chain, that's what i'm questioning, is there a control difference between main chain and second layer.

I see there are 7k hosts on couchsurfing in Beirut, trying to figure out how this can be combined to make bitcoin available there. I mean if you connect with this community any upcoming visitors could bring you bitcoin. How much would you consider a honest percent to pay for this $200 purchase.

You don't take classes about how to use a credit card or handle cash to the counter. You're saying that you're reporting bugs and build infrastructure for VISA to handle payments, I'm not able to imagine your actions into the old money system to be able to better understand what you do for Bitcoin.

What can I say, you have to many responsibilities to be able to explore this or I'm an idiot
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:22:02
instead asking to get paid in crypto why not rewarding your fiat clients with a small amounts of bitcoin. next time when their friends will talk about bitcoin they will join the discussion and share your business and story. I think is more efficient for your business like that. 
@_date: 2019-06-08 18:55:26

isn't that dangerous to use change, I mean I would rather use a single address for payments and trash it out instead moving change from one to another. From my experience with HD wallets, I always linked my previous addresses to the new ones because of not using a friendly wallet to allow me to spend specific inputs.

@_date: 2019-06-10 13:23:16
just because you've never been able to question for yourself about it doesn't mean the others are not willing to explore. Bitcoin is a tool, like a bicycle, it's all about you to decide where to go.
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:53:15
for you to be able to value your seconds. no more dollars per hour, now we have satoshi per second. it's not about how much you earnis more as how much you spend. don't understand it? try to spend 1 cent per second for an entire month

saying that a system that was designed with 2 quadrillions 100 trillions units is not good enough for small transactions, i think is wrong, but i'll wait for your mainstream argument for LN
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:40:47
dont take bitcoin as payment, if you really want to help reward your customers with small amounts of bitcoin, teach them to install and use a wallet. they will thank you in the future. do something like cryptoback.us

What about bitcoin.de?
@_date: 2019-09-20 12:08:53
Bitcoin books are stupid, things are happening fast and content gets outdated. Saifedean is a gold shill and Nathaniel Popper was promoting fake telegram ico. If you really want to get connected to the space, ignore shitcoins and try to join online communities where you can have an open discussion with other "experts", in your case, book writers.

@_date: 2019-09-22 12:58:53
to reach that objective you either need to create jobs where people can trade their time for bitcoin or just force businesses to reward their customers in bitcoin. If both store A and B sell the same product, I will spend my fiat with the one who gives me a cashback rebate in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-22 13:09:00
bitrefill was nice, I've used it in the past to top up my mobile phone, since then I've changed my number and decided not to share it with third party services, I'm afraid of them getting hacked and exposing my phone number to hackers. What are the other 2 places?
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:35:28
I agree and hope more people are willing to understand that
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:43:42
I agree that there are not so many places to spend your bitcoin but I will be more than happy to spend my old money with the stores who reward me with small amounts of bitcoin, stacking sats.
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:46:16
it's a pain in the ass to comply with the regulations when it comes with accepting bitcoin and I think, you as a business owner, it's more efficient to try to attract more customers by rewarding them small amount of bitcoin, the community is small and you can easily advertise your products this way.
@_date: 2019-09-20 12:30:07
you can live completely on bitcoin if your source of income comes from the space. I mean nowadays it's quite simple to exchange bitcoin for fiat to pay your bills. You are no different than an expat that live into a different country earning a different currency. Even if I don't think you'll be able find a bitcoin job, there are a lot of opportunities in shitcoins that might get you a decent crypto monthly income.
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:53:09
even more they would be able to learn more about bitcoin just by using it. think about getting a 10% cashback for your restaurant bill, I bet you will share with all your friends
@_date: 2019-09-20 12:24:36
is stupid to ask businesses to take bitcoin as payment, if you really want to help ask them to reward their customers in bitcoin, for example they can raise the prices with 10% and return this amount in bitcoin as cash back.

@_date: 2018-07-22 23:52:03
 on telegram. give it a try
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:54:11
you are not able to spend something that you're not able to control, that's why encouraging businesses to reward their customers in bitcoin is a good idea
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:50:48
if you already offer discounts for fiat payments why not to return that discount in bitcoin to get more customers, I think it's a quite easy and efficient marketing
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:54:55
then help me raise awareness about it;
@_date: 2019-09-22 13:16:14
probably your goal is to expend your business and generate more fiat sales, I think that accepting bitcoin raise the awareness of your products but a smarter way to do this would be to ask your clients to install a mobile wallet and send them small amount of bitcoin when they pay with credit card. think about, next time when this people are willing to debate bitcoin, they will automatically share your business and will let other know that their first bitcoin came from you.

I've noticed that people who've missed the 2013 boat have no problem to buy today at $4k

there are projects like lolli that reward customers in bitcoin for online purchases but none for in store sales. For example this could be a quite nice strategy for a restaurant owner to advertise his business by returning 1-5% from the bill in bitcoin.

because they are already doing this, even if now they keep their discount in house and force you to spend that value next time when you visit them, this will change.
@_date: 2017-10-06 06:10:58
Unless I get some real benefits by paying with Bitcoin I won't use your system. If you want me to be your customer, you will have to reward me with Bitcoin, not important what amount, because I already expect $10 today to be $1k.

This post if about how nocoiners could earn some bitcoin not about how to spend them. Think about getting 5% cash back in bitcoin daily for your groceries

Beware, there are plenty of scams out there and chances for you to lose your money are very high. Best thing is to try and learn what's going on, if you really want to invest, buy some bitcoin, store them into a safe place and read more.
@_date: 2018-07-20 21:52:10
Please don't, if you really want to make a change just reward your clients with Bitcoin. For each product you include a 0.5% cashback in Bitcoin, if you want to make it even more fun, you can associate each of your products with a private key so nobody can copy them.

Check Copay, they have a multisig wallet that you can use along with your friends to secure your coins. I mean you can hold your entire stash on trezor and some hot wallet on multisig with your friends, each time you want to spend some, one of your buds can sign and confirm your transaction.

everyone's bank statements are available, the interesting thing is that you cannot tell for sure if that's my door or not.
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:22:19
of course they did, is more crazy to accept that customs computers where infected for a full year than holding 200k bitcoins
@_date: 2019-05-09 22:04:38
I think multisig is more eficient than trezor + fireproof case. unless you put the backup paper inside of it

bottled water is good, but you need to trust someone. read this: "I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party... "

It seams to be General bytes, the reason I'm asking is that the local ATM operator replaced the old Robocoin ones with these new models.

if you're looking for bitcoin, you're wasting your time. you pay 2 sat per every second you spend watching it.
@_date: 2019-05-16 23:54:58
Nothing, but only if you think that Bitcoin is the product of the banking cartel.
@_date: 2019-05-31 12:09:32
check electrum, it allows you to setup a multisig wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-29 01:38:07
I would not accept bitcoin as payment at all, rather than that I would give them a 10% discount in bitcoin every time they pay with their credit card. 
@_date: 2019-05-20 09:57:07
Wait and see what's going on. Spectrocoin is pretty big, they have some bitcoin one way buying machines around here, frankly I don't think they risk their reputation stealing your money.
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:07:11
I don't think this poker site exists. Use electrum as wallet and let us know when you control your coins.

 multisig. simple and free. no more hardware wallets and the familu will be happu to watch the price raise from their phone
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:32:41
it's a scam, don't get cheated. the website is fake, can't believe that so many news websites toked the cash without verification
@_date: 2019-05-29 01:49:24
nevermind, at least make sure you don't pass change from one address to another.

it's a scam
@_date: 2019-05-19 18:07:54
instead of a 25% discount code why not to reward your fiat clients with a 5% cryptoback in bitcoin?

good question, I have some friends that are worried each time they use their hardware wallet because of that.
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:22:15
because I need at least 3 hardware wallets to make a multisig and cryptosteel is still better than holding the seed on a piece of paper

phone was adopted as land line first but I think it reached mass adoption with mobile. anyway to get with you on this topic, I think 10 years is too much but when we reach that point ETFs, stocks and trillion dollars markets will be gone

hardware wallets are stupid, you will end by having a piece of paper with some words on it, it it gets damaged or stolen you lose your coins. have a look on multisig: 
@_date: 2019-05-29 10:22:15
dump your shitcoins get some bitcoin and use bitmex to amplify your holdings
@_date: 2019-05-20 08:32:02
there is no need to care about fees, customers alreadu trust uour business. i've done some experiments on cryptoback.us, but latetu i imagine having a custodial wallet and a way interact with customers live about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:31:05

@_date: 2019-05-27 11:05:51
is it multisig more secure than a hardware wallet?
