And here we come to the crux of the matter. Yes, Bitmain is slowly losing monopoly on SHA256d miners. But it also knows this, which is why it diversified into alts. But the competitors still coming......whats a brother gon do to get these pesky competitors out da yard?
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:56:19
I don't think LN can make Bitcoin beat credit cards. I think people who think that have absolutely no understanding of credit cards......and may or may not have a very poor understanding of personal finances. 
Bitcoin is internet cash/gold. When you use Bitcoin, its like you use cash. When you use a credit card, you are using CREDIT that you PROMISE you will pay with CASH at a later date. People who use credit cards primarily do so not because it is convenient (its not, that how they get you with the late fees and shit). They use it because they want something........but they 1. Can't afford it yet but can in the future. Or 2. They want to pay at a later date. 
Everything else is actually just  social/political correctness in dealing with personal finances. 
I think people misunderstand the market that Bitcoin is dealing with. Bitcoin CAN become a collateral to back some sort of credit card yes........But the Lightning network is definitely NOT supposed to replace credit cards, its supposed to replace DEBIT/paypal bank transfers and stuff like that. 
Please understand the difference between the 2

If you think Bitcoin is decentralized.... you’re in for a treat. 
True that it is far more decentralized than any other currency in the world. But its far from actual decentralization. Its more like a confederation.
@_date: 2018-05-29 18:49:51
Sure why the hell not I got time to kill anyways.  
1. ACs are absurdly expensive to run for anything larger than maybe 200 miners.  
2. Liquid submersion is actually VERY inefficient vs the cost to run and maintain it.   
3. The miners who pay 0.03usd/kwh \+ millions on liquid cooling may very well be fucked ones since they just sunk tons of capital into equipment instead of shifting running cost in a bear market. But I'm not here to help other miners so I'll leave it at that.  
4. The best miners are definitely not making 5$ per miner, thats average. And if you've been in this as long as you say you have \(maybe you started the same time as me actually\) you know this also.  
5. Bitmain do not have the same miner for a long time, they switch out and there are evidence of this from the miners they ship.
6. Mining cost even for the very best of mines that have paid off their miners are still more than the 2k/btc that you claim, you are not factoring in running cost, maintainance, staff and land cost, and that makes me very doubtful of your claim to be an actual miner and not some dude setting up rigs in his garage  
7. If a dude has an ASIC and are shutting it down due to the price of Bitcoin dropping; they should not mine Bitcoin because they are retarded. But then again, I'm not here to teach you how to mine Bitcoin \(like actually mine it\)  
8. You say you pay 0.00$ with a Solar operation, how many miners you got? like 5? Your Solar panels magically dropped from the sky one day? Or did you rob someone for them?  
9. Mid\-sized miners will not turn off their ASICs at 6.8\-7k They may turn them off if the price hits 4k though.  
10. It is true that Bitcoin mining is dominated mainly by \&gt;100 Big mines But Honestly they pay more electricity than we medium mines do. Also, our running costs are far lower. 
I know you want to paint a picture of Bitcoin mining being super centralized and I'd say you maybe right in some things. I've even said it myself at some point. But the longer I actually stayed in this business the more I realized that I was wrong.   
@_date: 2018-05-29 18:51:50
Yep, everyone hates each other and yet still here we are......eating from the same plate
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:05:28
What? isn't it 2mb blocks? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:32:31
and here I thought only anti-social nerds used cryptos
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:48:55
Because there is more transaction per block. Basically its like an airplane ticket. First class 4 people per roll, everyone pays alot of money to be in that 4 roll. Expand those 4 seats per roll into 8 and everyone pays 1/2 as much. Ofcourse, there will still be people willing to pay higher fees to get their transaction through quickly, so overall miners *should* make more per block. 
Segwit is good! don't get me wrong, its one of the main reasons I love litecoin (that and also its very fast). 
Lastly: theres something everyone keeps forgetting. Never put all your eggs in one basket. Yes, Segwit is going to be great, Lightning network is going to be awesome and may or may not make me rich. However, Giving Bitcoin to 1 company that holds most of the patents to sidechain technology is a very bad idea incase they do something very awful. Doing a 2x increase will give *us* (users) a choice. A choice to choose what we can use: On-chain or side-chain and we can choose forever if we get a compromise. But if we DON'T get a compromise, 1 side becomes increasingly more powerful than the other and soon you get a monopoly.
I know from a technical stand-point people will say thats not how lightning works. I know, I drank the coolaid. But we still don't know how all this shit will play out. And even with Segwit, On-chain transaction would be 2X, with segwit2x it will be 4x which is on par with that of Litecoin.

@_date: 2017-08-02 16:30:37
That still doesn't explain the fact that they made confirmation 100 god damn Blocks......... 100 Blocks on the BTC blockchain is already 12+ hours man.

Litecoin for the fucking win
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:34:53
Bitcoin will never die. I don't think Bitcoin cash would die either. Hell, people thought Ethereum classic would be dead by now, but it isn't. Its just the way it is. There are merits to both sides, thats why its always good to compromise and hold your head high in the knowledge that you did the best you can. However, for some reason people are willing to go all brinksmanship when it comes to Bitcoin. Realize that in a war, the side that wins is the side that didn't participate. 
You can shout and intrepret anything you want, but as a small farm miner, I can tell you that we have no allegiences. We are mercenaries, the side who pays us more will get our hashpower. Ideologies are a burden in this line of work.
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:30:56
This needs to go up more. Slush only accounts for ~6% of the total hashrate of Bitcoin. Which isn't alot. So, if you want to REALLY know what we miners think, look at the Blocks. Have you looked? guess what? still 90%+ Signaling for NYA. Because guess what? We do want Segwit2x. Ya hear me devs? We actually do want Segwit2x, we're just too busy to come argue on the internet everyday. That doesn't mean we're not voicing our opinion. I got tired of all the stupid shit that is going on in this Bitcoin "Civil war" that is harming ALL of us, like everyone that is even remotely invested in Bitcoin is going to get fucked if this thing doesn't get implemented CORRECTLY. So please, get your shit together and just make it work. Its good for the users, its good for miners, its good for investors, its good for everyone, Segwit will take care of the long term, 2X will take care of the immediate short term. Hopefully by the time Lightning network takes full effect, we won't need to Hardfork ever again. Just make this one work!

Then lets not put Segwit in as well, because we shouldn't change bitcoin on a whim of a few CEOs - or any other special interest groups
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:54:50
Wanna know a secret? the reason I didn't mine Bitcoin cash this oscillation is because Bitcoin's price got pumped to 4.5k while I was mining, so never bothered to switch. 
If you want us to stay during the next oscillation, instead of thanking us, maybe put in a bit more transaction fees and pump the BTC price up a bit?
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:27:25
They WILL shutdown large hubs
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:38:44
uh huh, and how is Segwit2x a change at the whims of CEOs?
I'm certainly not a CEO
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:35:54
This guide isn't a scam, but I doubt it'll help any of us......wanna know why? Blocktime is around 6 hours, and they are making the confirmation for fund transfer like 20-100 blocks....... Which means that realistically, if we wanna........I don't know......sell some shitcoin. It would take 6X20 = 120 hours = 5 DAYS to put our funds on an exchange to actually trade. 
Thats the fastest by the way and not factoring in some kind of shinnanigans (that is probably going to happen, because lets face it, it always does). 
So to recap: The majority of Bitcoin holders won't get JACKSHIT unless BCH survives for at least 2 weeks. By which point, the people behind it would get what they are after: Legitimacy and contention of the true bitcoin. They can then sell their shitcoin to Banks and other institutions claiming it is the true bitcoin. 
Either way, what they just pulled off is not going to end well for decentralization. They really thought this shit through
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:36:37
Its funny because everyone is focusing hard on one company bein. The bad guy in Bitcoin space that they actively promoted another company that is also increasingly showing signs of becoming the dictator in Bitcoin space.
From an outsider's perspective, I think it is safe to say that Bitcoin now actually belongs to Blockstream. They are the ones with majority sway over the community and they can push whatever agenda they want. Ironic....in trying to prevent Centralization, this community inadvertantly created a centralized authority.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:58:26
from Bitmain
If you guys are still having doubt that this shit is one massive scam. 
NO ONE IS GETTING THEIR COINS ANYWHERE NEAR AN EXCHANGE. The only people that will have BCC to sell are the guys who were prepared for it and left their BTC in exchanges that creditted them with BCC. 
No dumping can occur, just price manipulation. And by the time the majority of people actually get their BCC to sell on the exchanges, it'll be worthless and Craig Wright would finally be able to pay off all the debts that he accumulated
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:57:52
I'm not trying to troll, if I had the actual time to troll I'd do something more productive than talk to strangers on the internet. However this is an actual concern. If segwit2x fails, things are gonna go belly up in a hurry. Thats why I am talking to you guys right now, to gauge its success and future of bitcoin. 
So far All I'm getting from one side is: NEVER GOING TO HARDFORK
and from the other side its: CORE IS EVIL and SEGWIT IS BAD
What about the vast majority of us that want both? where's our voice? apparently we can't have both? Even with both segwit AND 2x increase, Bitcoin still does not rival Litecoin. So its not like we don't need the capacity. We will ALWAYS need the capacity. And what if I want to do on-chain transactions along with Lightning?
Having a 1-mb block would mean that using on-chain transaction would becoming increasingly expensive because we would have to compete with Lightning nodes. So we would all be forced to use lightning nodes. What happens if they go sideways? Its a legit concern from the vast majority of us who aren't "redditors" or "small blockers" or "big blockers" or whatever the hell. 
Sigh, sorry for the long rant
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:41:39
How about Litebit? Bitlite? 
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:20:38
Exactly, I will admit I don't own alot of Bitcoins, but I do own some, I do have some hashpower as well. Do we not count? This is absurd, its not even a bad thing, 2mb blocks are quite good for the system. If anything Bitcoin core should actively work to make Segwit2x a thing
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:51:19

@_date: 2017-08-20 17:27:41
lets discuss: 
I have a 128gb micro-sd card in my avalon controller right now. So in theory, 2-3 years from now I'd still be able to have a full node running for pretty much the same price. Although I do think 8mb is pushing it. Theres nothing wrong with 2mbs though. 4X capacity on Bitcoin would be a huge leap (for at least another 2 years)

Nodes are just software that I can download from the internet for free and takes me 5 minutes to change on my computer. Its not that big of a hassle to change nodes. Although I do agree with it taking up more bandwidth = bad.
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:05:01
Then maybe someone should come and fix those things? Damn, should have learned coding in College instead of trying to save lives apparently.
I understand where you're coming from though. Basically if Segwit2x succeeds it sets a bad precedent. Maybe users should do vote for a hardfork of their own? Would that be such a bad thing? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:58:22
In my country there is a proverb: If the war's not over, don't count the casualties yet.

@_date: 2017-08-20 02:47:19
I don't know if this is true due to FUD, but apparently they are the ones that developed Lightning and other stuff like that. Personally I am hoping for Segwit since I am a Litecoin user.

I'm a user and I'd say if pretty much everyone agreed that segwit2x is bitcoin, then it is bitcoin. Didn't you all agree to it? Didn't your "enemy" ok the segwit part? This is some funny stuff
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:37:28
Well, I think the reason why it is now perceived as "hostile" is because it was never intended to be a fork. It was supposed to be a rule change to Bitcoin. But now people are yelling that they don't want the 2x of the Segwit2x. It is a compromise from 2 sides of people who want the same thing (but not necessarily the same thing). 
Blockstream wants segwit because then they can finally make money on all their 2nd layer solutions.
Miners want 2x because they get paid more for onchain transactions.
Users want Bitcoin to be faster and cheaper. 
Ultimately Segwit2x is GREAT for users. IF you are a user of Bitcoin, Segwit2x is the best thing that could ever happen to you. Because then you can finally pay cheap fees for fast transfer.
However, Both sides are trying to screw the other because they want a bigger piece of the pie (or ALL the pies actually). But this is stupid, the pie is huge and everyone will benefit from Bitcoin if Segwit2x gets fully activated. 
So the real question is: why isn't Bitcoin Core developing Segwit2x? it should be a priority for them
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:40:16
Well well well, a smart one we got here. Please stop thinking of us miners as "evil" or whatever, most of us are actually Bitcoin enthusiasts, thats why we pay a shitton of electricity cost every month.

From all I can tell people say its going to make running full nodes more expensive. But I run a full node with my mining rig and I have a 2TB Harddisk with nothing on in......it costs 50$.

Understandable really, but honestly speaking the OP is right. I understand that not alot of people have money they can afford to let sit idle. But having been in this as long as some of us have, its been proven over and over that buying and holding limited supply items have always been a better wealth investment strategy than trying to time the market. Unless ofcourse you are a market mover with capital able to push the market one way or another. In which case, eating plankton becomes more profittable.

Just because you hate Bitmain (lets face it, who the hell doesn't hate bitmain, all you need is just call them once to understand WHY people hate them) doesn't mean that you should allow ANOTHER company to take control of bitcoin as well. Competition is great. But what is happening right now is basically 2 group of companies fighting for control of Bitcoin. 
Guess who loses (hint: its us)

The lightning network owes you. You cannot use the Bitcoin inside a lightning channel OUTSIDE of it until you close it. Lets say You have 1 BTC inside lightning. But you really need to pay the hospital because your mother just got in a car accident. The hospital accepts BTC, but it does not use lightning network. You WILL have to close your channels and transfer your funds out of lightning to send it On-chain to the hospital.

Fuck Maybe u/Bashco should just ban me again because this is no better than r/btc.

Each country's CB is a different entity and they serve their country's agenda. With the Global economy fracturing under the weight of a looming US trade war, it makes sense for CBs to look for alternatives other than the USD. I'd wager that the earliest Central Banks that adopt Bitcoin will be countries that are directly fucked by US sanctions and rogue states. Then comes the smaller countries looking to gain an economic edge over larger, more powerful countries. The slowest/non-adopting Central Banks will ofcourse be the ones you describe above. And the US will definitely be one of/if not the very last to adopt Bitcoin. Bitcoin as it stands is the greatest threat to the USD. 
Which is ironic for me because most of the early adopters are US citizens or US educated. In a sense, US Bitcoiners are kinda betting that their country is gonna be fucked.

@_date: 2018-03-23 17:55:14
You are only half correct. We miners aren't all united in any sense so keep that in mind.
There are 2 scenarios which plays out when a Bitcoin tanks and diff goes up. 
If the miner has running capital and is long BTC, then running capital is substituted for electricity instead of selling BTC. &lt;--- OP is correct.
If the miner DOES NOT have running capital, then he would have to sell more BTC to cover running costs. &lt;--- you are correct.
So basically you're both correct. It depends on the miner. Not everyone who mines bitcoin believes in it. Some are here to make a quick buck because they're stupid/ignorant/naive or all 3. 
Bear markets usually weed them out. The bigger the fall, the faster they leave. Which is great for the rest of us.

Because even with Segwit, Lightning and MAST, there will always be a need to do on-chain transactions (Thats pretty much the core of Bitcoin, no pun intended). A 2mb block is not a very big increase, But it would double the transaction capacity of the blockchain. This along with Segwit and future 2nd layer implementations would mean that Bitcoin will be useful even 5-10 years from now. 
Its better for Bitcoin, and everyone involved with Bitcoin to scale now while Bitcoin is still relatively small than to wait for mass adoption to hit Bitcoin and then be constrained by even more governance problems is it not? 
Think about the "civil war" that is going on now and how much damage it has caused to the Bitcoin community and Crypto-community as a whole. Now imagine Bitcoin at 100k per Bitcoin with not just regular people but Corporations and national interests all weighing in on the whole scaling debate. Think its hard to do a fork now? wait till you got 100+ million users and they all think they have a say in it. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 10:02:10
Tell me about it, and because of the way BCH mining works, its insanely centralized into the hands of large mines. Literally no one else can compete with them for blocks without being fucked by the DAA
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:45:34
I think there was another thread explaining this problem earlier but I couldn't find it. 
The jist of it is that China is probably not going to ban Bitcoin mining in China, if anything, they can do 2 things. 
1. Take control of the miners either confiscate or make every miner in China register and pay income tax on mining.
2. They put up a firewall or block port 8333 making Chinese nodes and Foreign nodes unable to sync, or have longer lag syncing. This will create a problem in that miners NOT in China will have a higher probability of Orphaning a block. Or at the very least have a harder time finding a block due to latency. At the very worst, It could cause a chain split with Chinese miners creating a longer chain and hence, everyone else would be screwed because they have the most ASICs.

The sudden increase in transaction is through spam. The spam costs money, ALOT of money to make. read the other comments. that'll give you the full picture

I disagree though, I think we do need a Blocksize upgrade, but just a modest one to help ensure utility in the future. It will become gradually hard and harder to implement a safe hardfork. And the timing window I believe will be closed soon. But I also do understand these things can't be rushed. We'll see how it goes though :)

If you think this will put Chinese Bitmain at any disadvantage you haven't been paying attention. Long story short: Bitmain has capital the likes of which Mt.Gox (you know, the one that causing the ongoing bear market right now) can only dream of. I'm more afraid for all of us. Bitmain can, and will absolutely saturate the Mining market with 1000$ S9s until they fuck over Halong. And If Halong cuts their margin close, they may not survive a trade war with Bitmain for long. The only way we "win" is if a large company like Samsung, Nvidia or even shitty ass AMD are willing to make the plunge into ASIC manufacturing. 
Miners are moving out of China true, but doesn't mean they're not Chinese. And thats not even the problem anyways, the problem is not many other people are willing to fork out the capital to open competitive mining pools. I mentioned in some of my earlier posts, the reason why Bitmain's mining pools are so big is because they are able to manage their cashflow oh so amazingly well. No one can come close to what they are able to do because no one got that kind of Bitcoin. PPS is a dangerous game and if you don't have at least 3 months reserve, your miners will leave. All of this for something like 1-2% gains.
I hope you are right and Bitmain becomes a good guy. But cmon, who the hell are we kidding. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:33:42
Thats not actually true. While most mining pools are "based in China" the Mining farms are much more geographically diverse than the pools themselves. Also quite funny not alot of people talk about that. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:53:51
This is also correct, I'm pretty sure in 10 years alot of words are going to be archaic/deprecated. IOU for instance, But for now the terminology stands.
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:10:48
if you haven't gotten it from all the other people who responded to this post. Here's a bit of truth from me.
Bitcoin is the safest and most secure crypto not because it is the longest running chain, the actual longest running chain by block height is dogecoin with a block height of 2.1m vs Bitcoin's ~501k
So no, Bitcoin is NOT the longest running chain. Bitcoin has a much better security than other coins because it has the MOST PROOF OF WORK POWER put into it. And has the LARGEST HASHRATE over any other coin in existence. So basically, in order for someone to rewrite the Bitcoin blockchain or "hack" Bitcoin, they're gonna need literally ALL of the supercomputers in the entire world and an absurd amount of electricity. 
To the second part of your very stupid and arguably time wasting post: A Blockchain without a cryptocurrency is just a database. The Blockchain is literally just a series of encrypted data stored in a hard drive. What is innovative about that? nothing.........absolutely jack shit.
I don't really actually know what youtube channel you watch. But I don't think you have the slightest clue as to what any of this technology is.

@_date: 2018-03-25 14:18:00
ok, Let me break it down into layman's terms. Any Lightning devs feel free to chime in if I get anything wrong here.
It is a correct assumption that the funds that you transfer from your Lightning wallet to mine will be instantaneously valid. However, that is also you assuming that I will keep the funds you sent me in my Lightning wallet. However, If I wanted to transfer the funds to say.......my Trezor, I would have to close out my channel in order to do it. 
Here comes the interesting part of this conversation, I don't think many people understand the form of money that we use today. Including IOUs, everyone keeps thinking they are a form of debt. True that it is, but an IOU is pretty much every single bank note that exists before 1971. 
The bank notes signified that the owner of the notes were entitled to whatever the value of the note was worth in gold by the government. And honestly, every single type of commodity based trading is a form of IOU. Hence, Lightning IS a form of IOU. 
It is an IOU of Bitcoin. HOWEVER, since Bitcoin is not ran by the government, OR any central authority, the IOU is completely between the participants within the Lightning network. And unlike traditional IOUs which has to be redeemed at a specific point/central authority: Lightning Network channels can be opened/closed by anyone that runs the software. And since the software is open sourced thats pretty much anyone.
Which is why Lightning network is considered a 2nd layer protocol. It is the IOU layer of the Bitcoin layer, just like the original [bank notes] were supposed to be the second layer of [gold]. But unlike Physical gold, which is very hard to move, hard to count and overall a pain in the ass to transact with due to purity, and cheating (like putting lead within gold). Bitcoin cannot be forged, cannot be cheated, is very easy to move, very easy to count. So what does lightning offer to Bitcoin? Scalability, and thats really all we need (probably a little more privacy too).
Sorry for the long post

the Volatility is one thing, but like mentioned earlier: Trust is the biggest issue. Its like seeing your money, but this one douchebag says you gotta way 16 hours til you can withdraw it. Again, I know its stupid, but non of us are perfect. Hell, I'm a relatively small guy compared to them, if I had 5 BTC per day mining income I'd probably think differently as well.
Not alot of Miners have access to futures market *Yet*, only the big boys do (200+ PH) so yea, it kind of turned into a situation where everyone is actually in it for themselves (which is actually the correct game theory driven economy outlined by the Bitcoin Whitepaper). But the payout scheme brought out made it much more stable and hence *perceived* as more profittable in sticking with a big pool. 
It happens everywhere, not just in Bitcoin. Hell, we got the EXACT SAME PROBLEM with Litecoin. A while back Litecoinpool was givingout something like 105% pps, completely wrecked Bitmain and became  pool for a while. 
Its all about which pools give out the most profit consistently to an individual miner. Its just that the Chinese pools are perceived to be much more consistent than any western pool available. And by the looks of it this will never change because no Western pool has the running capital to payout miners everyday like the Chinese pools (economy of scale).

Well, thats a pessimistic way of viewing it, but to each their own I suppose. I'd rather we all take a breather and stop fighting one another unless we all contribute to the destruction of the very thing we're trying to build.
Sometimes, its better to not fight fire with fire, especially when we're all living under the same roof you know.
If they do tut and point, so what? Bitcoin cash is still not, and never will be, Bitcoin. 
Also yes, miners are staying, far more than last time (If you don't recall, let me joust your memory since I'm a miner). Last time everyone jumped ship when BCH had a difficulty change that made it roughly 1.4x more profitable to mine than BTC. This caused A MASSIVE backlog to pile up on BTC, not only that, even with SUPER HIGH FEEs, transactions were taking about an hour or more to confirm because half the hashpower just decided to switch off to BCH. And guess what, because the way most of the mining pools worked, it meant that miners had better odds at mining BCH and then selling immediately rather than staying in BTC and mining because most of the pools didn't give out the full block reward or charged a fee on the transaction bonus.
Well, we're better prepared this time. And alot of good information and a raise in fees will keep the Bitcoin network much more stable than last time, with less disruption and just the right amount of fee increase (instead of the ludicrous 400-700sat/byte we saw last time).
I hope I have convinced you somehow, but if not then I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.

Hey guys, You do know that whoever did that is literally saving BTC's ass and stabilizing the hashrate right?................RIGHT?...........PLEASE TELL ME YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND.
If not let me explain. Bitcoin Cash has an EDA, which means we're about to head to another insanity Hash-shift war. Whoever did this to the mempool literally stopped this from happening by
1. Miners mining Bitcoin now gets the same amount of money as shifting to BCH. Hence, less miners are gonna switch to BCH
2. BCH is about to reach its own adjustment period, which means about 40% diff increase. Which means that Bitcoin will STILL be more profittable than BCH after the diff adjustment.
3. The mempool should clear by the time the diff adjustment of BCH kicks in. Then we will probably see the mempool clear and everything will be back to normal, with the majority of hashrate still on the BTC chain and a minority on the BCH chain to prevent it from doing an EDA.
4. I hope you guys understand that if whoever did this (and I'm not convinced its someone who would wish harm on bitcoin) DID NOT do this. We will have another wild fluctuation in Hashrate. And then Bitcoins gonna go through another rough week.
5. This way, the only thing thats change is just a temporary tx fee increase.

Which is still an IOU, but its a very Very fast IOU. Think of it this way. Lightning is IOU in which instead of a central bank to control the IOU, its the users. So basically the best form of IOU. The form that is gold backed and settled. Except that gold is also digital and can be sent anywhere in the world in half an hour instead of days. Also, the IOU is now settled in seconds instead of 12-24 hours (for businesses that accepts visa/mastercard). So yea, overall great improvement.

Fine, here's the lo down, since you want it so much.
Although Bitcoin mining is now centralized in China, this wasn't always the case, up until around 2013, it was pretty evenly distributed. Since Bitcoin has a fixed inflation rate, as listed in this thread.  
As you can see in the graph, by 2014, When Chinese miners really began to consolidate mining in China, the inflation rate (the amount of coins being produced annually) was down to roughly 12.5% What does this mean in layman's terms? It means that from 2014-2017 All the miners in the world combined created only ~19% of the total Bitcoin in circulation today. Giving the Chinese miners a large margin for all those years, I'd say the probably mined around 90% of the 19% coming out to around 17.1% of the total Supply of Bitcoin. Is it alot? Hell yes it is. But they are a big country, and account for ~20% of the world's population, I'd say the distribution is not that bad.
If you think China has a monopoly on Mining, you are very wrong indeed. They may not look like it now, but the majority of Bitcoins created were actually made in the good ol, US of A. I reckon more than 50% of the world's Bitcoin was probably mined in the USA and nothing can ever change that, not even if the Chinese miners had a monopoly of Mining from now until the end of time. Because Bitcoin was designed with that in mind and to create a stable network as time goes by. 
You should read about it here:

You say lets patch it up without changing the tire. Your friend says lets just throw the old tire out and buy a new one. You say: fuck man, thats expensive and the new tire won't match the other 3! So your friend says "fine fuckface, we can patch it up now and then we can change the tire once we get to Texas". Now you're 3 months feom Texas and arguing with your friend that you didn't agree to change the fucking tire and that the cars fine theres no need to change the fucking tire.

What would happen though is Bitcoin prices would skyrocket because the reason why Chinese miners had an advantage in the first place would be neutralized. The cost of creation of 1 BTC would be about 20-30% more expensive due to Higher electricity/infrastructure cost.
I still highly doubt Mining in China will completely cease. But if you take out the hatred and racism. This isn't actually good in the long term. China accounts for 20% of the population of the world. You can't just lose that many people and not be affected

Actually, Blockstream is just as bad if not worse than the other crowd. Their push into sidechain is also a power grab. And also a money grab, there's not denying that. 
The poor will always fall prey to the rich. Its just the natural state of things. No matter which side you choose in this "Bitcoin civil war" you're fucked either way. Its much better to get Blockstream and Jgarzik to fight each other, constantly, without one getting the upper hand of the other. That would be best for everyone involved. And if you want to upgrade Bitcoin, then you have to do it in such a way that a group *may* benefit from it, but it is such a trivial benefit that its *almost* not worth it for the group, but great for everyone else.

What did you expect? Most of us miners waited fucking 3+ years to make the profits we did in 2017. We fucking suffered hardcore for it. Even Bitmain.......the company even I find very hard to love......barely broke even for years. Its a shame to see how split the community is now, and I do think that this will be a year of "reconstruction" after our "civil war". After that MAYBE Bitcoin becomes great again. If not......hey........a house divided something something

its 3 before segwit, with full segwit blocks it'll be 6 I think. If you can actually make transactions smaller, and doubling it again, it'll be 9. Then we take over the world lol

Don't read all the stupid nonsense of people trying to shove their opinion into your brain. 
S2X in very easy and more correct terms is this: You're on a road trip with your friends. One tire runs flat, you go to the Shop with and agree that you guys need to fix the tire. You say lets patch it up without changing the tire. Your friend says lets just throw the old tire out and buy a new one. You say: fuck man, thats expensive and the new tire won't match the other 3! So your friend says "fine fuckface, we can patch it up now and then we can change the tire once we get to Texas". Now you're 3 months feom Texas and arguing with your friend that you didn't agree to change the fucking tire and that the cars fine theres no need to change the fucking tire.
Thats pretty much it

Hey, I'm not Chinese but I do support Segwit2x. Hopefully Core devs will make Bitcoin core the main Segwit2x node implementation soon though. As with you I do not feel like cutting out the main Bitcoin node implementation will be good for Bitcoin. But the majority of us do believe that Segwit2x is a very good thing for Bitcoin as a whole.

The problem is that most miners on r/bitcoin will not even make a dent in btc.com pool. Most miners I know that mine there are very large mining ventures based out of Russia and China. They don't come here. Also, it will be very hard to convince them to go to a pplns pool when they want stability and a fixed income. The main thing is there are no alternative pools that pay PPS+ from any mining pool other than those that are affiliated with Bitmain, and thats a fact. Yes sure, Slushpool is nice, and I do mine there from time to time. But no large mine is going to risk 500+ PH worth of electricity on your Pool luck unless it is in their favor. So with PPS+ they (perceive) to lose very little and gain alot of advantages as compared to PPLNS. 
TL:DR = Most large miners are willing to pay 1.5% pool fee as cushion against unstable payout.

Are they paying taxes? Are they subverting state power? Money from Bitcoin is trivially small compared to State power. While we like to stay in our little bubble over here and think that we actually matter in the world now, the fact is, we still don't. The market cap still fluctuates wildly because the real value of the whole cryptocurrency sphere is still small. Our value is smaller than the value of Walmart goods imported from China every quarter for crying out loud. 
In essence, the National CCP doesn't give a shit about any crypto-business in China, they make crap money for the state, and pay even crappier taxes (if any). But the potential for this tech to disrupt Authoritarian regimes are immense. So anyone can logically conclude whats about to happen.
Its great that we make the world aware of Bitcoin, but as the saying goes: A small dragon should never fight a Large Tiger. Bitcoin's potential is great, but if we pick fights we can't win now, we'll get rekt

Traders don't think like that, I own a significant mine and also do some trading. Traders are basically playing musical chairs with money. They look for the upside and the downside in the short term. If you're a whale, then you also play with people's emotions when you cause a splash in the market. They don't care very much about fundamentals. Those are the large institutional investors and Hedge funds, but not alot of them are here yet. But when they do, then the traders will be very hard pressed to find volatility to profit off of.

They don't go after your wife and kids if they think you got Bitcoin. But in China? that shit can totally happen, and every Chinese knows it.

Here's the analogy I make when people say that all the time. 
Q: Is Bitcoin truly scarce? because you can make an infinite number of other competing coins.
A: If you think like that let me ask you another question. Is Gold truly scarce? There are many other commodity metals trading right now. Bronze kind of looks like gold. You can make gold looking substances like Iron-Sulfides (I think they're called pyrites). Then theres Brass, which is very widely used as a substitute to gold. 
True, any retard with a keyboard can probably fork Bitcoin and call it Bitcoin Jello, or Bitcoin 2.0 or Bitcoin Titanium or whatever. But is it Bitcoin? Thats like a guy handing you a Brass dildo and calling it a Golden ticket to Valhalla. Just because this tech is new doesn't necessitate ignorant stupidity.

here's what I think. I kinda understand why the devs of BCH wanted to have the EDA and that they think it would help save BCH from dying because obviously, no one is going to mine it. But seeing it work, and using it, it kinda feels like a video game if you know what I mean. I have immense respect for the dude who actually switched a whole mine (like 400+ s9s) to stabilize the network and prevent an EDA. But God damn man, this is one seriously crazy situation we got here. With any other altcoin (like Peercoin or whatever) this would not be the case cus they change diffs every block. 
This whole thing has kinda turned SHA256D mining into a game.........a very, very dangerous game. 
And then I digress and realized I didn't make the damn rules.

The problem with Strong governments are that they are fragile. China wasn't strong for 3,000 years. It was strong, then weak, the strong, then weak. We've had many deaths and destructions along the way. So while I do agree with you that we do tend to have strong governments, the reason why is actually because we are ambitious, and this ambition is what drives us in all ways of life, Government included. The reason why China CANNOT have a weak government, or even a period of weak government is because the very moment the government becomes weak, they will fall, We are the masters of Rebellion. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:24:38
won't argue with that
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:20:46
I agree with this, even with a 70% hashrate decrease (if ALL the mines in China somehow get rekt by China attempting to desync nodes inside and outside the Greatfirewall (which is still very stupid and probably impossible). It would still take maybe 2-3 weeks to reach a difficulty adjustment. And I don't think the Chinese miners are just going to fold that easily on a multimillion dollar investment. I still believe we should at least have a 2mb block sooner than later though, Bitcoin's about to past that point where a Hardfork will never be an option ever again. You should look at ways to cram as many upgrades into a 2mb hardfork as possible, as quickly as possible.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:04:47
That may very well be the case too. But without exchanges in the country, Miners in China are going to have to sell their coins on foreign exchanges and get USD. Guess where they're going to keep the USD. (hint: its not in China)

@_date: 2017-09-18 15:32:02
Its not up to us to fix it. Like Bitcoin, anything you wanna do with Bitcoin cash will have to be through a consensus change. Its freaking amazing that It hasn't collapsed into nothing. I don't know why, it benefits miners like me.....sure, but damn man. I don't really care about politics but an altcoin created FROM BITCOIN and uses the same SHA256D algorithm freaking survives, has value and is actively competing with Bitcoin for hashpower?

Luckily for me, I understand both Chinese and English (although my chinese sucks).  I didn't draw my conclusion from just this thread btw, its pretty much this whole subreddit. And quite frankly, I understand, but it still sucks.
Saying China sucks is not racist, and also not offensive to anyone Chinese (except maybe super-nationalistic people). But thats the same as saying FUCK AMERICA those fuckers will bomb anyone for oil. Obviously if you say that to a white supremacist he's also going to be pissed. But the majority of you guys are cool with it. But if I say "Fucking Americans, you are whats wrong with Bitcoin, I hope America bans Bitcoin so we can be done with your stupidity". I think that would not sit well with anyone on here right?
Well, same thing with Chinese people, they hate their government. But people on the internet keep lumping them in with the actions of THEIR GOVERNMENT.

I understand and couldn't agree more. I got into this space to get away from "big brother" so to speak. So the idea of trading one evil for another is something that I think most of the community would agree is not ideal. 
I don't like the way Segwit2x was agreed upon either. But that being said, I gotta admit its a pretty good idea. Its kinda like the argument from r/btc that Blockstream is evil and r/bitcoin saying that Bitmain is evil. I personally think that everyone is probably evil AND selfish when it comes to money. That being said, Bitcoin's rules are in place to allow for progress even if everyone is evil and selfish. And the reason why is money, everyone that participates in the Bitcoin space is provably agreed upon to have stake in Bitcoin and wants to see it succeed, irregardless of method. 
That being said, all of your points are very valid, I am not a software developer so I don't know the intricacies of code, but I do trust that the developers (at least the majority) also have stake in Bitcoin and also wants to see it succeed in the long term.
Which is why I previously stated that why Bitcoin should be scaled now instead of later, when it will get increasingly harder (exponentially if adoption growth rate hold) to do a hardfork at all. 
Is it risky? hell yes it is, but it is a necessity if Bitcoin is to continue scaling. If the timeframe for Segwit2x AGREEMENT (NYA), then maybe Bitcoin developers can have a big civilized debate and reach a consensus on what would be a good time frame for such a hardfork to occur? Then at least I hope the community can finally reach common ground and Bitcoin and everyone in it can go deal with real issues that is governments around the world are restricting freedom and heavy-handing personal finances around the world in the name of safety and security.
so TLDR: I fully support a segwit2x proposal if the majority of developers agree that it is good and safe. Irregardless, I personally think that Segwit2x is a good idea. I do not however, think that running the Segwit2x (BTC1) implementation right now is a good idea unless it becomes clear that it will be safe and the project peer reviewed by more than 1 guy.
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:39:20
Theres no right or wrong in my opinion man. What I mean by "all wrong" is also subjective to my own opinion. Here's what I think. BCH is here to stay, at least in the short term. So Bitcoin has 2 choices, either deal with the disruption of a competing blockchain on the same mining algorithm or hard-fork. Obviously Hardforking is a very bad idea to begin with so we're going to have to deal with 2 blockchains competing for Hashpower on the same algorithm.
In a perfect world, the 2 chains will balance each other out in terms of hashrate and profittability. However, because both of these chains have long periods between difficulty adjustments, Miners can/and will/ switch over to which ever chain is more profitable (lets cut the politics/altruim thing out first since the reason for Bitcoin is we wanted to separate politics from Finance). So in an organic market, over time the oscillation will decrease and hashpower will stabilize. However, in comes EDA which was made so that BCH would survive its launch from BTC with very little to no hashrate in the beginning.
But with the last oscillation, people started to realize that the system can be gamed and its not good for BOTH coins. So it is very possible that big timers from both sides of the isle are probably willing to throw some money at the problem (at least temporarily) to stabilize the network of both chains. If you haven't noticed, the price of BCH was also hit with a pretty big dump right when the profitability of BCH/BTC mining went through the roof. If the actor wanted BCH to steal hashpower from BTC again, they would have pumped the price of BCH up along with profitability of mining it. But nope, all the events happening in a very short period of time suggests that this was deliberate. And it all points to stabilization instead of destabilization. Can it be multiple actors? certainly, can it be just one side of this so called "civil war"? sure. But whomever it was, it was pretty clear that what they wanted is NOT the repeat of what happened last time. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:07:09

As a miner, let me break it down to you. 
1. So Halong pretty much fucking rick-rolled Bitmain. I can almost guarantee that the Hardwares are the same. Maybe with the distinct exception of the controller board which may or may not come from Innosilicon (although many oldtime miners think it did come from Inno).
2. The major difference between this and the Bitmain's S9 is the Overt Asicboost. However, in order for the hash to make sense to the pool, they have to implement compatibility for Overt Asicboost. So far, only the western pools (Slush being the biggest, then CK, Kano maybe?) have that. 
3. All of this leads to what I would assume is going to be a pretty messy "mining war" because most of the chinese pools will either: 
A. never support it and hence block out a majority of miners from ever buying Halong (unless you want a much more expensive S7). And implement some sort of incentive (like 110% PPS) in order to keep their miners competitive until they figure out what to do. OR
B. come out with their own Overt Asicboost or something similar (because fuck it, why not, IP is not their strong point anyways) which ofcourse would be a legal battle in the states but amounts to jack-shit everywhere else. This ofcourse would mean that we're back to square 1. Hashrate is going to go through the roof and everyone without ASICboost is fucked for the foreseeable future

Fine, here's the lo down, since you want it so much.
Although Bitcoin mining is now centralized in China, this wasn't always the case, up until around 2013, it was pretty evenly distributed. Since Bitcoin has a fixed inflation rate, as listed in this thread.  
As you can see in the graph, by 2014, When Chinese miners really began to consolidate mining in China, the inflation rate (the amount of coins being produced annually) was down to roughly 12.5% What does this mean in layman's terms? It means that from 2014-2017 All the miners in the world combined created only ~19% of the total Bitcoin in circulation today. Giving the Chinese miners a large margin for all those years, I'd say the probably mined around 90% of the 19% coming out to around 17.1% of the total Supply of Bitcoin. Is it alot? Hell yes it is. But they are a big country, and account for ~20% of the world's population, I'd say the distribution is not that bad.
If you think China has a monopoly on Mining, you are very wrong indeed. They may not look like it now, but the majority of Bitcoins created were actually made in the good ol, US of A. I reckon more than 50% of the world's Bitcoin was probably mined in the USA and nothing can ever change that, not even if the Chinese miners had a monopoly of Mining from now until the end of time. Because Bitcoin was designed with that in mind and to create a stable network as time goes by. 
You should read about it here:

Its not about the fees, its about the back log. You guys are still thinking small, Bitcoin now is worth a very tiny fraction of the world economy, and thinking small will get it no where. We need to think big, 1% of the world economy. At least 10x the capacity of Visa, so with that, we're still going to NEED onscale transactions to be more than the measly 1mb right now. Even with Segwit and Lightning (which I fully support and I plan to run a full LN node when it comes out); there will be need for more on-chain capacity to keep the LN node fees low and no diminish the utility of Bitcoin.
ps: 5$ fee? no, I'm talking about 100$+ per onchain transaction, even with that, we'd still need more than 1mb

Funny you mention it, I posted before but the Banks in Asia are far FAR ahead in this game. My bank transfers are instantaneous, not only that, they are free (or like 50cents depending on the bank). We have had this for years and years. mobile banking, pay with qr code. It boggles my mind when I went to the US to see their banking system still so shitty. I was laughing my ass off when they told me it takes 3 days for ACH. I knew exactly then why USA was the birthplace of Bitcoin, the US banking industry are a bunch of monopolistic assholes, they give their customers the absolute minimum for the absolute maximum profit. 
But thats actually not why many of us in Asia are into Bitcoin. We're in it because the Banks fuck us in many other ways, not just speed and cheap transactions.

I won't argue with the centralization of mining in Bitcoin. But don't think Ethereum's gonna get away with it, soon......we'll mine them as well :D
The problems aren't the mining farms, the problem is equalization cannot be done in any system worth any money. Also, please don't judge the Chinese miners badly. While Jihan Wu has arguably the most punchable face in the world, many Chinese miners love Bitcoin and the idea of a free and decentralized money more than their own lives.

Ahhh, if only they 明白什么是比特币
I don't think many miners even consider this angle.
To answer your question: Chinese miners are very diverse, I think even more so than their western counterparts. Theres the rich techies, the small venture start-ups, the "scam mines", Jihan's friends, Large money laundering businesses, small businesses, tax evaders, People trying to flee from China, people trying to send money out of China, Communist haters, dissenters etc etc. 
to answer question  Yes, the payment model is of the utmost importance when it comes to mining pool. I am very surprised you guys (i.e western mining pools) haven't figured this shit out yet. You know how much shit btc.com got hit with when they were 2 HOURS LATE on payment a month ago?. Thats the level of importance a regular payout is to many miners here. There has to be a level of trust between the pool and miner. The miners have to trust that every single day, at this specific time, they get paid, nuclear war be damned.

they don't explicitly state it (because you, know, people are killed for smaller offenses here). But they sure as shit aint happy about it all. I do understand that for the majority of people, it is hard to have empathy for human beings half way across the world whom you've never met. But having lived in both the West and the East, I can say that despite all the cultural differences, people are surprisingly similar in every country. 
No one likes to be controlled by a system they have no part in creating. No one likes to feel like they're getting cheated. No one likes to wake up in the morning knowing that their lives are not their own. 
Americans (me included) pride ourselves in being "free". But the reason why Bitcoin exists is because we weren't, we might be "free" in some sense, but 2008 showed that financially, many of us weren't. Thats why Bitcoin is what it is today.
You want to know where people REALLY aren't free? The People's republic of fucking China. And you know who knows that? The people of the People's republic of China. They don't really have a say in their government, the CCP is sure as shit ain't inclusive. There are laws for fucking everything (including fucking). So don't even get started on finances. Its probably easier to commit suicide in China than to achieve Financial sovereignty from the State. That's the reason why all the rich people in China wants to fucking leave China. You think the Chinese miners started Mining Bitcoin because they saw a way to make quick profits? Fuck no. They knew from the start what Bitcoin was, and they quickly signed up for it. A way to finally do something, make money and not have to worry about getting fucked in the ass by the CCP? Fuck yes.
Admittedly, in the ensuing years, as Mines became larger and needed more finances and more power, Miners became fewer and many of them......*us*........had to band together to keep on mining. So yes, you can say it became more centralized, but it still isn't CENTRALIZED if you know what I mean. Mine owners are still different people with very different opinions and they fight all the damn time. But what I usually read on reddit makes it sound like China is the size of Las vegas and everyone knows everyone else and they're all in Cahoots to take over bitcoin or some shit. When in reality its pretty much the same as in the US. You guys just speak different languages.

Say you were selling lemonades.........One day, some hobo asked you for a free lemonade. Being the good samaritan that you are, you gave him a free lemonade. He says "thanks! random good samaritan I don't know" and went on his way. A few days later, the same hobo returns and asks you for a free lemonade again, you politely give him his free lemonade. But this time someone else saw you, so they ask for a free lemonade as well, but you don't give it to them. So they get angry and post all over the internet that you're a racist hobo-loving asshat that only gives lemonade for blowjobs or something.  
See the analogy? If you don't its probably just because Bitcoin mining is a business and we(miners) need to make the most money vs. time that we can while everyone using Bitcoin ALSO wants their money confirmed quickly vs. time that they can and 1mb ain't fitting all of our transactions and because we can't enlarge the blocksize forever unless every node wants to give out proverbial free lemonades (disk space) to hobos.

Not all americans are fat Climate change denialist who thinks exercise makes you die faster and is an egotistical maniac that got rich all by himself with a SMALL LOAN OF 1 MILLION DOLAS. 
Well guess what...........the average Chinese is not an ultra-national socialist communist who must destroy the western imperialists and subvert anything the west does in the name of Global prosperity of the People's republic of China.

I don't think Hodling is a bad thing, but it isn't actually good either. Bitcoin isn't supposed to be "digital gold" its supposed to be "digital money". We're just in the "store of value" phase of money. I don't mind that people hold but I do believe the better solution is to create value for the ecosystem rather than holding forever without doing anything. Thats how gold was fucked and no matter how much fiat FUD the goldbugs pump, its never gonna go up. Lets not make the same mistake and lose to the keynesians again.

Funny you bring this up. For a trustless system, the Bitcoin Ecosystem relies more heavily on trust than anyone care to admit. Its the Human nature to "trust" in something. Whether that is a person, a system, or even a planet. Its how we survived when other species failed. We trusted each other and that trust meant other people had our backs when we were sick/disabled and couldn't get food/water back in the early days. Thats why we have civilization. 
Fast forward to today in Mining: Miners have to inherently trust a pool with their money. In a PPLNS model, the pool assumes no responsibility for variances and pays out after 100 confirmation (about 16 hours). This means that the time it takes from when you start mining at a pool to the time you get a payout varies based on the amount of blocks the pool finds within a specific timeframe + another 16 hours for confirmation. This is very safe for the pool ofcourse, because after 100 blocks, there is 0% chance that anything can go wrong with the mined block. 
However, that risk is kicked over to Miners on the pool. Which have to 
1. Assume the risk of Luck with the pool (periods of low block vs period of High blocks)
2. After finding blocks, miners still have to wait 16 hours of confirmation before getting the reward for their work. And 16 hours is a LONG TIME in crypto
3. Miners have to assume the risk of whether the pool will run away with their reward or not for 16 hours after they have already "perceived" to have found a block.
With the PPS+ system that pretty much all the popular Chinese pools use, The Pool assumes all the risk by offsetting said risk with pool fees. Before PPS+ or FPPS (the one BTC.com uses). The transaction fees were low, so the pools didn't pay that out and used that to offset the Luck risk so that the pool stays solvent. 
Because in the long run, your luck variance will inevitably be pretty much 100%, pools make money off this. However, when the transaction fees rose, alot of the PPS pools had to switch over to PPS+ or FPPS because the transaction fees more than made up for the luck risk variance of pooling with PPLNS pools like Slush. But with FPPS and PPS+ the pools are guaranteed a set % of pool fee without inherently stating it (they take a chunk out of the transaction fee before averaging the rest and distributing it to miners). And the miners are guaranteed to make at the very least 100% PPS every single day. So win-win (in their mind).

For most of us, It doesn't matter if our money has to be paid to an "incorporated" or "miners" We still have to pay. And we don't have the luxury of First-world country ideologies about good and evil. Most of us just want to pay for stuff cheaper.

yup pretty much
But it could be so much more, but apparently no one actually wants to see it succeed, everyone is just in it for the sweet promise of getting rich quick. Most promotion of this technology is something like "Hey! you should invest in bitcoin! its going to go up soon and you'll be rich!". I doubt even half the bitcoin "community" actually thinks about bitcoin on a fundamental level other than "When is this thing gonna make me rich".

Bitgo, I heard they were good
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:54:27
Nah, If anything we get faster internet here than in the states......and cheaper too! You know who the real thieves are? ISPs
specifically: American ISPs
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:16:59
yea, I heard vietnam has higher SWIFT than us, I think your's is 1000Baht right ? compared to us 500. We do have capital control in place, but its pretty lax (like......very). 
ps: Hey! a fellow SEA user!
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:19:26
Depends on the country you're from. Bitcoin is alot slower than Banks in Thailand
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:17:42
But you get raped with the premium on localbitcoin for thailand :(
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:25:13
I know alot of you guys here are Bitcoin Maximalists. But after actually using LTC, I actually strongly believe that it is probably going to be better to use in every day life than BTC due to cheaper prices and faster confirmation time. BTC will always be there, but at some point you're going to have to trade the high value for utility on micro-transactions. If bitcoin goes to 10k for example, I don't think people will be using it to buy anything less than 100$. Thats where Litecoin comes in.
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:15:17
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:20:02
well, I guess we're early adopters :). But yea, I don't play the whole speculation thing, But I do love the tech.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:43:53
What? why send a bar of gold? you do realize there are international bank payments right?
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:51:29
you're right on that front, and I don't actually mind that at all!
I don't intend to make a bunch of money off cryptos, but the reason why I use litecoin is to send money to my sister so she can go to school.
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:30:31
the translator miss-translated because of my typo. What I actually typed was: I'm using it, but it sucks, can't even beat Kbank.
Alot of us are very tech-savvy in Asia, so we like to try new things, especially if it promises to do super cool stuff. I'm actually not angry about it. I just wanted to share the perspective of users. Its still slow, and yes, it has very high fees. And thats pretty much a deal breaker when it comes to digital finances
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:48:09
it happens on a consistent basis though
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:13:10
ใช้อยู่ แต่มันห่วยจริง สู้ง kbank ยังไม่ได้เลย
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:53:09
the first one is easy to fix though........it only takes time
the second one is alot harder
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:02:46
That is just fear-mongering. I don't know what you guys are doing over there in the west, but here everything is pretty much normal. The Financial system sucks.....yes. But guess what, Bitcoin sucks MORE. I am basically paying everytime I move my money, even if it is from one of my own account to another one of my own account (which is free for any bank account under my name in Thailand). I can send 2 dollars to whatever bank account I have under my name for free here and then send THAT for free to a merchant that has an account with THAT bank. Did I mention we DON'T PAY ANNUAL FEES ON ACCOUNTS?
I reiterate my point: I want Bitcoin to actually succeed. But I don't think anyone that has alot of stake in Bitcoin care even a tiny bit about the very thing they supposedly are marketing to people like me.
What can Bitcoin give me, in this instant and for the forseeable future that my bank can't? (Only realistic answers, leave politics out of this)
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:05:17
she exchanges it for cash. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:51:10
you make a good point! But to the end user its the same. I can for example send money from my phone to another person's phone using my mobile bank app instantly and with about 0.5usd fee right now. 24/7 and they can then use that money instantly. However, I do believe that they only actually transfer capitals once a week or whatever, and there is still a chance that hyper inflation can blow up the whole economy. So bitcoin's got that going for it. 
Bitcoin still got the banks beat on international transfer though because the fees of bitcoin are on par with those of SWIFT but the transfer time is much faster
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:15:22
Well, for one It would be super-cool if we can go to any country and get a fair exchange rate ( we get raped on exchange rates). Almost every country in Asia has their own currency with varying degrees of volatility and some countries it is very hard to exchange money so Bitcoin can (in theory) solve that. But right now it can't yet. But it would be great to have instant overseas transaction for low fees!
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:11:49
Inflation rates are at an all-time low, our money is actually appreciating right now
edit: sorry, I misunderstood depreciation and appreciation. Basically the Thai baht is now much stronger against the USD
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:17:13
thankyou for your constructive replies, I really didn't think I was gonna get many.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:40:12
That makes sense actually!
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:04:50
Yes we do, we have had it for at least 4 years now
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:34:14
pretty much the same for eggs, bread costs a bit more. Rice costs a bit more too.
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:09:03
I've been in this a while man, thats still what I meant though. If the price of BTC is not +2700 (which takes the whole market up with it) and with exponentially increasing difficulty (like right now) You'd make money back in maybe 2 years
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:34:55
Oh you don't need to remind us guys from South East Asia. Unlike Americans, we don't have the memory of a goldfish. The collapse we endured in 1997 is still pretty damn fresh on our minds.
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:09:19
ahh, its about the same then
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:55:08
As a Litecoin user: please no, maybe the DASH guys would consider?
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:29:25
you haven't seen the PRON man!
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:27:49
Welcome to the REAL WORLD. You want a WORLD DEMOCRACY? Well China is the most populous country in the world. Don't act so surprised when they win more votes.
@_date: 2017-06-24 14:47:11
This is just one scenario though, They could just push for more regulation on ALL cryptocurrencies and make it very hard to use for everyday things. But to be honest I am still 100% in this boat with the rest of you. Given time, this technology will be the next revolution, just like mobile phones and the internet
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:29:58
Explosion imminent! prepare to short!
@_date: 2017-06-30 12:48:06
We're in bubble territory now
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:26:41
Yup, actually right now its almost not worth the price of electricity anymore lol the ASICs are doing ok though (for now, until Bitmain pumps them out like toasters)
@_date: 2017-06-23 05:51:19
If the central bank of USA wanted to "intervene" in Bitcoin, they could easily destroy the value. Think about it, Bitcoin has no official reference price (maybe electricity?). They could easily pump the price of bitcoin up and dump it to create mass panic and the speculators and retarded whales are all gonna sell. This will, at the very LEAST deal a massive blow to the cryptosphere. Lets just hope they don't get that smart
@_date: 2017-06-24 09:37:07
This implies that there are more people with faith than there are speculators. Of which I do not believe to be true at the moment (It was the case before May 2017). Lets just say I'm being cautious and my hope in Humanity is not much.
@_date: 2017-06-24 15:50:18
It's the same for 3rd world countries, I live in one. Anything that can undermine the central authorities are quickly killed in the cradle here, Let alone a technology poised to revolutionise modern finances.
