Agreed, it's defo a useful resource that i'll be sharing with friends and family. 
Hoping it will be even better, as more information is added through our feedback :)

great :) perhaps a card (trello uses cards right?) for each page. ie a top level list for how to buy bitcoin with cards for:
- choosing a way to pay (cheap vs fast)
- doing the background research on the exchange
- choosing a wallet
... etc

I think most authors steer clear of giving recommendations for buying bitcoin. If you've been around long enough in bitcoin then you've seen those exchanges go down/offline etc. Most people would prefer not to say where to buy for that reason IMO. 
That said, there are great resources to prepare beginners for buying btc, such as the steps on [Howtobuybitcoin.io]( which go through the peripheral information that one needs (such as doing due diligence, choosing the cheapest vs fastest payment method, choosing a wallet etc). Those are all super important steps that many beginners overlook because no one points them there. 
Perhaps we can add these steps to the awesome bitcoin handbook also ?

Agree!, That would be a mistake, same as Iphone app ecosystem and developer community is one of the Apple's biggest strength, not a niche a all.
