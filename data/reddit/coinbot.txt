no, If you are using the post or get action, you don't need to give us the API key, we just make a http request to your server, then you can do trade etc. from your code. the API key should be stored on your server, you can also validate the order price, amount etc. before actually make the order.
You only need to provide us the API key if you don't want to have your own application to perform the trade

I've made some security improvement, please see the [new post] (

I want to focus on implement more platforms and conditions etc instead of the UI design. Also haven't decide to open source or not until I got most of the feature done

The only information required is your email address and API key if you want to trade, how can I get your wallet.dat with that?

The password is not in used yet, will find better way to store it

previous we create a seperate key for add job etc. 
now we've change to encrypt using bcrypt

What are you worrying about? If you want to use this for trade, you only need give the API key with trade permission, we can't see your balance or withdraw. Also the api key can be removed anytime easily

I've tried to make sure all functions are working, but making money or not is all depend on how you set the conditions

which password? coin-bot password currently is useless, we will store md5 hash of it. We do not require your password from other platform, we only require your API key with trade permission

I know it's hard to trust a new service, I'm not expecting people to start using with their real mtgox key and I'm also not recommend that for now. What I want is people to try with email notification and using the mtgox account without any balance first to see if this is suitable for you or not. You got noting to lose with that.

Open souce just make it more vulnerable, it doesn't provide any protection. The API key is not mandatory to use this service, you can still use email notification but just can't automatically trade.
Since it's just start, SSL is not the most important things now, I'm focusing on more features, but definately will use SSL

this is my highest priority things to do, hopefully it will be supported within next few days
