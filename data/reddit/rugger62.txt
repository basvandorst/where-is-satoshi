[Here's the summary of COIN on the NASDAQ]( You can look at the filing history, which takes you to the actual SEC filings. ~~They haven't created the Trust yet~~, so this is 'Meh. Nothing to see here'. This is the fifth amendment to the original S-1 filing from 2013.  
Edit: Reading further, they did create the Trust as of 12/30/2014. Still, this is Meh until a complete S1 is filed.

if all we have is 47 hours of Segarra working, probably not. If a reporter somehow corroborates how regulators roll over at large institutions yes. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 10:03:37
what's more interesting is the way regulators strong arm small banks - those small banks don't offer the 6 &amp; 7 figure paydays that the big NY banks do. I would love to see a reporter talk to the community banks in his area about their interactions with regulators, and from my experience, we will find a regulator that is swinging the hammer.

Here are the [conflicts of interest rules and code of conduct]( for US Federal Court. IANAL and I'm getting my first cup of coffee, but I think it's up to the judge to decide and there are no laws on the books dictating any scenarios when a judge has to relieve themselves from a case.

There already is one, GBTC
@_date: 2015-01-01 15:21:43
I don't remember the details because it's been a long time since I worked with DSTs, but there is something about them that makes them preferred for pass through vehicles. I assume tax treatment.

Shouldn't the transaction be denominated in a fiat currency and then set up to require x number of bitcoins to complete the transaction at the time of sale? This can simpify the refund process by giving some options if you want to refund in bitcoin.  
Alternatiely (although I'm sure hugely unpopular in this sub), you could issue all refunds in fiat to get around exchange rates.

That's an imgur problem

You can own btc in a retirement fund, but only if the plan administrator allows it. I think there are a couple out there, but the fees are (imo) too high. 
Same goes for holding investment property in a retirement fund.
@_date: 2014-08-15 14:01:47
I don't think it will go to court since it's only $10. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 11:33:43
Except GBTC was trying to get publicly listed too. It opens the shares up to institutional investors and a Hugh pile of capital.
@_date: 2017-03-23 13:13:39
It would be a whole lot cooler if they did
@_date: 2017-01-19 10:52:17
Jeez, 15% upfront fee for the IRA that lets you hold BTC. That's steep.  
GBTC is great, but I'm looking forward to the other publicly traded options (hopefully they eventually materialize).

I don't see how the chain could even get hacked. You have a private connection between the organizations. It would be a major intrusion for someone to get inside.

I'm in Charlotte. How successful is bitcoin in the Triangle? Do businesses accept payment? How many people do you get to your meetups? 
@_date: 2015-07-22 18:52:56
Banks are not going to be using bitcoin, but are going to be using block chain technology to securely transact with each other...  
This technology presents a vastly more secure trading platform than what companies are using. There is no reason why 'bitcoin' can't be substituted with 'shares of stock in company x' or 'xyz bonds' and traded via a unique blockchain.

I won't be able to go on Friday because of work, but I'm trying to make in on Saturday. Have to juggle stuff with the wife &amp; kid.  
If you want any pointers about Charlotte, let me know!

There won't be any mining. It's a way to replace support staff and accountants for financial companies. It could vastly simplify certain products. I'm thinking structured products and other fixed income products.

and the government should enjoy it through capital gains tax
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:01:32
Sweeping profits. When you consider short term capital gains tax, a 10% gain isn't worth it. I usually move at 40%.
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:17:01
by that logic, the citizens are part of the government...

Go to Market Performance to see the calculated value. There should be a prospectus in Resources that explains the background.

Working in finance, it could be a way for the community banks to differentiate themselves from the large national &amp; super regionals. The issue I see is that community banks tend to lag the big firms in terms of user interface, since they don't have the capital to have powerful IT departments. I don't know if everyone knows this, but the IT department at Bank of America would one of the largest IT companies in the world if it was a stand-alone company.   
That said, I have no idea was Community Bank NETSEC is like, but there are a lot of issues that need to be worked out with a product that relies so heavily on the www. How are you going to protect your keys? What about issues with exchanges?   
I mean, I have trouble finding a community bank or credit union that has online banking platforms that keep up with BoA and Wells, so how confident can I be in any BTC related venture?

If encryption gets zapped by the Torries, how will it affect the market there? Can you trade NYC without encryption?
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:25:02
i don't know enough about the market mechanics, but i think that the price isn't going to vary much from platform to platform.

if you're one of the dealers buying directly from greyscale... 
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:47:36
they do, you should go to *edit*  and read about it. It supposed to track to 1/10th the value of BTC as published on their exchange.
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:08:33
What are the best or most reliable sources to study? My biggest worry is lack of unbiased information.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:05:13
The volumes on GBTC lead me to believe that there are a lot more investors entering the game. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:58:19
i would have to re-read the prospectus to see how and if they address a fork in the risk assessment. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:26:22
i still don't understand the impact of forking on BTC. are there any good papers to read? I also don't know what the manager's position is so it's a guess as to what path they would take.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:58:53
More to understand what it means if I own bitcoin
@_date: 2015-03-27 18:54:27
Yea, the don't have the capital to invest in IT the way the big banks do. It could also be decisions based on their security policy, but I don't know enough about community bank IT to say what the actual root cause is.  
I imagine it also has something to do with the fact that most CEOs of community banks have been in the business since before the internet became public.  
Someone should be able to start a tech focused bank/CU from scratch, but the regulatory requirements &amp; amount of capital make it really hard for someone with less than 20+ years experience in the industry to open a bank. That and you need someone with deep pockets to invest. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:57:37
Bitcoin is entirely based on encryption though. How else do you get a private key?
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:55:48
no its not, in the last month it's been below 10% premium to spot. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:51:09
not all brokers will trade it, but you can on Schwab as well. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 17:44:29
Exactly. $117 billion portfolio....  
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:55:22
can't do it in retirement accounts...
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:54:54
i make limit orders with Schwab and they all get executed very close to my limits. Unfortunately i missed out on a huge part of the increase because had my sell limit pegged at $267 and now i can't justify getting back in b/c of the premium.  
I'm also a little concerned that in their most recent filings they reported in the fine print that they are no longer insured...
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:24:49
Don't want to pile on that guy. Are those coins lost for all time, or can they ever be recycled?
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:12:48
Are there any statistics on the number and amount of bitcoin transactions occuring daily? Im not looking for exchange info, i can find that, i'm looking for the number of bitcoins changing hands.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:07:26
If so, OP better brace for a libel and slander suit.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:44:52
Just theowing this out there. Ifevery btc in existence (12.045 million) traded at this price, all bitcoins are worth only $12 billion. That is less than JP Morgan's recent fine of $13billion. 
Food for thought.
