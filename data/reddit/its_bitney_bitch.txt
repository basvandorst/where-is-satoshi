"You are the bank" is a bit of a false selling point since most new users are forced to use SPV because of the resource requirements of running a full node.  And yet so many supposed bitcoiners are in favour of making this 20x worse.

Dude you're way confused. That's not an invalid address. Addresses don't actually exist at the blockchain level. They're just a convenient shorthand that wallets use by convention. The checksums are just checked by wallets - they don't go into the transactions that the network sees.

I tried again today.  This time at a designer beach clothing store (with a store front and an online store).  The dude at the counter was the owner of the business and I think he was the designer too.  He had heard of bitcoin before and thought it sounded quite interesting, and asked me a few questions on how he would go about accepting it.  I suggested it might cost ~1% if he wants dollars into his bank account, and he said that was about half of what paypal charged him.  He wrote down some notes regarding some payment processors etc... then he joked that he could put a sign on the window about it :)
I'll be keeping an eye on how it develops and will be sure to shop there again once he accepts bitcoin, and to list him on coinmap.

So far?  But blockchains haven't even began to hit the scene yet.  Watch the Blythe video.  The trust model is very expensive and complicated for those businesses that are at the top of the trust heirarchy.  The blockchain can decrease cost and increase reliability for those businesses (the big financial firms involved in settlement).
The land title registry in honduras is a great example of this.  Also the Nasdaq experiment, and now the Overstock bond.  It's only just beginning to happen in an experimental way.

It is essentially a chicken and egg problem:  To have value, you need to be able to use it to buy things.  For people to be willing to accept it for their goods/services, it needs to have value.
To beat that paradox you need people to put blind faith into a worthless currency because they believe in it, to the point where they are willing to lose time and money to its cause.  That's what bootstrapped bitcoin; hundreds/thousands of people pouring their blood and sweat into something that was nothing more than an idea that they wanted to see succeed.  It was able to do this, because some people understood the power behind Satoshi's idea and wanted to build a future where Bitcoin was money.
These days there are just so many altcoins, with very little to offer in terms of new ideas.  It would take something really special to create that bootstrap effect.  Sometimes a random spark can build something special, like Dogecoin with its simple joke that got thousands of people's excited about a currency and community that didn't take things so seriously.


The only people promoting those altcoins are the people from those communities, and they are very small compared to the Bitcoin community, although there is overlap and in a way we're all working together to make cryptocurrency succeed.

The bubbles don't usually begin to pick up pace until they break through the previous high.  If we were to have another bubble, it would probably start with a slow but relentless rise to $1000 over several weeks, then volatility and volume picks up and it starts to have wild swings before eventually breaking the resistance at the ATH and bursting through to new ground.  At that point, resistance breaks down and that's when it would start to go crazy and begin moving $100-200 per day as it gets into full bubble mode.  Where it ends, nobody knows.

The other alternative that comes to mind is that there could be some interactive sequence of messages where the two parties generate an address using some kind of diffie-hellman type of process.

I'm pretty sure you're wrong about that.  The whole idea of stealth addresses is that you can know someone's stealth address without being able to see the transactions that were sent to it.  So having a transcript of a chat with a stealth address in it will *not* let you find the wallets of either the sender or recipient. On the contrary, directly referencing normal addresses in a chat will directly link you to both the sender and receivers money.  It's like the difference between saying on the phone "hey, I'll give you $20 next time I see you", or saying "I'll give you $20 and the serial number on the note is X1234..".. it's just unnecessary info to include in the chat.


Who said anything about prices or products?  What if I'm just chatting to a family member on Skype and want to send them some money.  I should be able to do that privately if I want to, without linking anyone's wallet to the chat.
@_date: 2015-01-31 06:24:37
Thanks Bro.  Keep us posted on your latest analysis.
@_date: 2015-01-01 22:46:01
From my basic understanding, the third message goes into the blockchain and the recipient has to brute force all OP_RETURN outputs to find messages intended for them.  So that does not sound like it would scale at all going forward, especially not on a cell phone.  Since the users have a direct communication channel (the instant messenger), it makes more sense to use that.
Re the secure messengers, that's an option but it would be a shame if people couldn't use their favourite messengers to transact with privacy.  I'm thinking of mainstream use cases where it has to be simple and easy, and non-technical people should be able to do it.

With non-stealth transactions, you can set up bloom filters with your peers, so you are only listening for a small subset of transactions that match addresses you are interested in.  So those type of SPV wallets (eg. android wallet, mycelium) don't actually need to download whole blocks to check for transactions, and they also don't get *every* unconfirmed transaction relayed to them, but only the ones that match their bloom filter.

It's safe, and for extra security you can store your coins in their vault for free.  Note that you are trusting Coinbase to return your coins though (eg. they could go bankrupt, or run away with everyone's funds, but the chances are probably low that you would lose your money this way).
If you want to store the coins *yourself*, then you can still buy them through coinbase but transfer them out to your own cold wallet.  If you do this option, make sure you know what you're doing because you're taking security into your own hands, so you need to make sure you don't do anything insecurely or have malware compromise your wallet.

By default, bitcoin core only fills the first 50KB of a block with priority transactions.  The remainder of the block is filled in order of fee-per-kb with no regard to priority.
Your roadmap sounds great, but I really wish smartfees were higher on the priority list (or at least some advanced controls for increasing to a higher fee).
@_date: 2015-07-07 00:17:25

It's actually 1000 bytes in bitcoin land, so your rounding is correct!
I like these 2:
10 sat/B
100 bits/kB
Although I think sat per byte might end up being too course a measure.  We only have 10 levels smaller to go from that.  If BTC is worth $10k it won't fly.

Personally I think we are entering an era where bitcoin will remain constantly under attack, forever.  The same applies for all other systems on the internet.  If you run a server, you will constantly be port scanned.  If you run a mail server, spammers will constantly be trying to relay through it. 
Bitcoin has been lucky enough to be off people's radar while it grew up, but now it might have crossed a line where there will forever be "cosmic background spam" that just doesn't go away.  It could be coming from many different sources, and who knows their motivation.  It's like when you see a pair of shoes thrown over power lines - who does it, and why?  No one knows, but it just happens, because it can.
With time I hope to see the system evolve to live with this.
@_date: 2015-07-24 12:07:15
It doesn't say that anymore.  It says:


@_date: 2015-07-07 01:28:18


This could very well be the "new normal", especially if bitcoin continues to grow with a 1MB limit.  Even if the block size is raised, eventually blocks will fill up, so wallets have to be ready for this.


This is only true if the rate of new transactions is less than 1MB every 10 mins.  Otherwise, there will be low-fee transactions that can be permanently starved of confirmations.


I'm curious, what other features are higher priority?  Where do smartfees sit on your roadmap?
@_date: 2015-07-06 23:33:39
What fee did you pay, and how big is your transaction (in bytes)?

The payment protocol is designed to solve this problem (BIP70).
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:25:09
That's called replace-by-fee, and bitcoin core does not currently have that feature.  Some pools are known to do it, eg. F2Pool, who has implemented the "first-seen-safe" variant.  However, you won't be able to relay double spends since most nodes on the network won't forward them, so you have to send them direct to the pools that support that policy.
@_date: 2015-07-08 09:13:05
What would be the use case for base58 dice?  You can't produce uniformly random 256 bit private keys with it.  Also you couldn't produce keys in the wallet import format as they include a checksum.  You'd be better off with hex dice.
@_date: 2015-07-07 00:24:02
Sure, but at the moment they are allowing users to skimp on fees by choosing "Economy" which may never confirm.  So the damage is done already.  If setting fees too low is the issue, they should only allow custom fees greater than the economy setting.  They could also put a ceiling on it to prevent mistakes.
Better yet, have it automatically fetch recommended fees via some API.  (or allow multiple APIs and let the user choose)

That's pooled mining, not SPV mining.  SPV mining has to do with whether or not the pool is fully validating the chain that they are mining on top of.  SPV mining is dangerous because the longest chain can be an invalid one, as happened with the BIP66 fork, which can cause SPV wallets to be fooled to accepting payments on an invalid chain.

Don't forget the generational effect.  Every year that bitcoin gets older is another year where some teenagers turn into adults and start earning and spending money.  The new generations are far more comfortable with using a mobile app than swiping plastic cards or handling paper.  Finance is being disrupted with the digital trend, and it's going to happen whether it's bitcoin or not.

There are no addresses, there are just zerocoins.  The math behind it is working differently.  Basically, a zerocoin transaction is a way of burning some normal coins in exchange for having some zerocoins (this doens't provide any link between the burnt coins and the zerocoins).  Spending zerocoins is a way of burning "some" of the zerocoins but not any specific ones, and getting fresh normal coins.  So there's no link.

You musn't have been around long enough to see the ghash.io pool grow to 51%. Even though people like you kept saying it would never happen because miners will protect their investment, the reality is that the miners all wanted to stay in that pool for superior earnings, and wait for someone *else* to leave the pool. Their selfishness turned bitcoin into Ghash Coin and we lost decentralisation altogether, making bitcoin nothing but an expensive paypal. In the end, it wasn't the miners themselves that came to their senses and left, it was the pool operators that had to forcibly move people out of their pool, only because of immense community pressure on the pool's management.

@_date: 2015-10-28 11:30:27
My point is that it's not worth $300.  Read my first comment, as I already explained that.  The RMB does not fetch $300, as there are capital controls in place.  You're using the official exchange rate, which is only available in restricted quantities, hence why bitcoin is trading at the actual real world RMB value which is less.
The bottom line is, bitcoins aren't worth more in China.  They're worth the same as the USD price on US exchanges.  Right now the Huobi price is 1981 yuan which is "officially" (in fantasy land) worth $311 USD.  In the real world (not fantasy land), that yuan is worth $302, equal to the price on USD exchanges.  You're just confused because you're using an incorrect exchange rate put out by the government that doesn't reflect economic reality.

One thing you should do if you haven't already, is back up your wallet.  There's an option to do that in Mycelium.  You just have to write down the master seed on some paper and then store that somewhere safe.  If you ever lose or break your phone, you can restore your wallet by entering those words into a new copy of Mycelium.

Not sure, because I haven't looked at the implementations. But I'd say it can be any number of satoshis.
Sidechain transactions take a long time to become valid though. Like, a hundred or more blocks. So it wouldn't be the typical way that people move between chains. It's probably be easier to use an exchange or service like shapeshift and pay a small fee to swap coins instantly.
@_date: 2015-10-23 09:27:51
I don't agree that bitcoin doesn't have a fungibility problem. Ideal money is perfectly fungible. Bitcoins are all uniquely identifiable via their chain of transaction history through the blockchain. It's a technical problem. It can be solved and there are solutions out there. No point pretending bitcoin is perfectly fungible when it's not.

You really misunderstand blockchains.  Of course every node executes every script.  The ether cost will be according to the resources required to execute the script by a single node.  Just like in Bitcoin we pay fees per kilobyte, even though the number of people who store that kilobyte will be variable.
Trusting a website or not doesn't change the fact that scraping a site is not compatible with blockchain consensus.  If I want to break this hypothetical scripting system that you describe, I could just sign a contract which will evaluate to true for some miners, and false for others, and I cause a consensus split.  Of course, that's not how it works because the ethereum devs wouldn't be silly enough to try to introduce external state into the scripting language.

Multi-sig means that multiple people need to approve a transaction before the money can be spent.
Off chain transactions are where two people might have money deposited in a bitcoin bank, and the bitcoin bank allows them to do internal transfers between accounts.  Those transfers don't result in any actual movement of bitcoins so they are called "off chain".

Well Bitcoin is like a completely independent financial system built from scratch, which has no dependency on the old banking system.  Sidechains (the 2 way peg) are effectively a way to introduce new financial systems with their own (mathematical) rules and regulations, and be able to move money between them at will.
You can think of blockchains as islands, and the 2 way pegs as bridges between these islands that let people move around however and whenever they want.

That doesn't make sense.  The blockchain isn't some computer that exists on its own.  Each node has to execute the scripts to determine whether they are valid.  If a script's consensus depends on the contents of a web page, then it would be trivial to cause a consensus fork by making a web page that shows different data to different users.

Wallets do two things.  Firstly they store your keys.  Secondly, they create and sign transactions with those keys.
The exception is the piece of paper, which can store keys but obviously can't create/sign/broadcast a transaction, as you need software for that.  So a paper wallet is only part of the picture, as eventually you need to type that phrase into some software to spend your money, and then you end up relying on the security of that software and the system it's running on.  So I would not recommend a paper wallet as a complete solution.
A hardware wallet is a fully isolated wallet that stores keys and can create/sign transactions, all on the device itself.  Since it is such a simple embedded device, it's resistant to malware, unlike a fully fledged computer which can easily be infected with malware.  So hardware wallets are more secure as they protect your keys and never let them leak out of the device.
The term "cold storage" just refers to keeping bitcoins stored in a wallet where the keys are offline (not sitting in memory of some computer that's plugged into the internet).  An online wallet is called a "hot wallet" and it's far more at risk since it's only a step away from being hacked.

If you watch the trades on Huobi, almost every big number (eg. 30+ BTC) trade is a sell.  Like 90% of them.  Considering that this dominates the volume, but doesn't push the market down, indicates to me that it's someone selling to themself.  Also, the buy side of the trade never seems to come from the order book, so the limit order for the buy side must appear very quickly and occurs inside the spread.
@_date: 2015-10-07 20:17:47

There is no end date for bitcoin, so the blockchain goes forever, so the total size is unbounded.  But you can bound the growth rate based on max block size.  At the moment with 1MB blocks, it can grow at a maximum of ~52GB per year.  But if we fork to a larger block size, that figure goes up.

A common technique is to do dollar cost averaging.  So once per month you buy $X worth, regardless of price.  This way you benefit from dips in the price without needing to pick where the bottom is.  If you go all-in at one price, you are taking more risk (with potentially more rewards).
Another way to think about it is to have a target of how many bitcoins you want to own, and just work towards that over time.

Yeah the problem is what we don't all get a million, because there aren't enough buyers at that price.

For example, bitpay merchants couldn't get any USD into their bank accounts for their sales, because bitpay can't sell any of their BTC due to lack of buyers.

No, because in order to claim the frozen bitcoins, you need to submit a proof to the bitcoin blockchain that shows you burnt the coins on the side chain.  If you spent the sidechain coins, someone else owns them and can do the burn instead.
BTW, the only way to create a sidechain coin should be to freeze a bitcoin. Therefore all sidechain coins are backed 1:1 by frozen bitcoins. So at all times, sidechains coins are worth exactly one bitcoin. That's why they are called pegged sidechains.

That is a pretty retarded question, but I'm feeling generous so I'll take the time to explain it to you.
The problem is that there aren't enough buyers willing to buy million dollar coins to satisfy the amount of people who would want to sell their coins for a million dollars.  I can tell you right now that I definitely *would* sell 10 coins for $1 million so I could retire happy, but can you even find 10 buyers at that price?
Lets say you find only 1 buyer willing to buy 1 coin at $1M.  Every bitcoin holder wants to get this sale, so I offer to undercut and offer mine for $999,999.  Someone else wants the sale and says they'll do $999,998.  Imagine this series of undercutting offers continues until we're down to $5000, and then a 2nd buyer emerges, because $5000 bitcoin sounds like a good price to them.  They'll take 5.  Now there can only be 6 sellers that get $5K for their BTC, but there are still hundreds of us sellers fighting to get that deal.  Drop the price down to $1000 and more buyers start to emerge and we have a market.  But sellers are still sweeping all the cash off the market every time a buyer appears, leaving no cash for all those BTC holders who are trying to sell.  This process continues until we reach an equilibrium where the demand from the buyers is equal to the supply of the sellers... and that's how you get a market price of $219.

Correct.  And even if it *was* possible for all nodes to receive a transaction instantaneously, someone new who joins the network was not there to observe it, so they would have to be told by the others what happened while they were gone.  So even then it doesn't provide a way for everyone to know the truth.  Proof-of-work allows newcomers to quickly determine what happened in the past by being able to observe the amount of compute power backing peoples claims.

@_date: 2015-10-22 10:14:40
Not really.  An exchange is when two people trade assets.  Eg. one person has bitcoins, the other has dogecoins, and they agree to a rate and swap assets.
A sidechain transaction only involves a single party.  When moving your bitcoins to the sidechain, your bitcoins get frozen on the bitcoin blockchain (they don't go to someone else as in a trade).  Upon freezing your bitcoins, the side chain issues you some new fresh coins.  The frozen bitcoins will remain frozen until you burn your sidechain coins, which allows you to unfreeze the bitcoins are reclaim them.

With a big hole in the order book, and other exchanges at 256, it's no wonder they would place their bid at 253, to be the first in line for arbitrage.
