a few days ago, I dreamt that a friend of mine sent me a message via Skype that it went $8,500... true story...
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:43:40
I'm very sorry to hear that.  We can come out of this stronger. Merry Christmas to you.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:49:33
I want to know, too.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:05:40
I'm excited to buy this dip!!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:11:40
My profit is dwindling :/
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:37:27
I bought Nov. 2 :S
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:05:52
big YES! to that :D
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:20:51
These predictions will somehow affect people's buying and selling behavior.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:31:42
Thanks, guys! I feel a lot better knowing I'm not alone!
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:14:27
not yet over.. still going down..
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:17:01
Keep on rising.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:30:00
Should I buy now or wait some more?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:23:09
lol I told my friend who wants to sell her bitcoins over fear of losing more to sell her btc to me to avoid fees.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:37:55
Crazy week.. I wonder what's going to happen this weekend...
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:34:07
lol I'll try!
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:27:45
YES!! Thanks for reminding!  It was just projected to breach 10K by the end of 2017.... it's 15K at the moment, way way beyond the expectation!
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:31:33
I got company! :D
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:14:30
I'll go with you!
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:33:01
gaining momentum
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:05:10
Thanks!! :D
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:19:50
Very true, mind conditioning.  I really hope btc stays strong. I'm in it for the long haul!
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:21:31
Wakes up at 17.2K :D
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:50:22
Yes! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:58:11
Not sure. We only have a couple of platforms where we can buy/sell btc. And there are still some who thinks that btc is mlm or networking or scam. And there are still a lot who asks what btc is.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:50:36
Yes, i'll tell her this ^! Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:11:39
Ugh! Such a tease!  Suddenly woke up at 3am and saw that it dropped to 19k, I bought some while half asleep thinking that it was the dip that I've been waiting for, I was so thankful I woke up in the middle of my sleep.. only to find out that it went to as low as 18k today. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:04:15
Eh? I wasn't expecting it. I was referring to today's low.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:20:04
it was 13.1 earlier.. maybe will go even lower
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:15:32
It's even way higher than the projected 10k before the year ends...
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:48:45
Apparently, yes.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:46:12
$29 to transfer my btc from my wallet to Bittrex... is this the normal fee?  I'm new to buying other coins.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:11:59
The country I am from doesn't have access to Gdax :(
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:03:53
I'm very afraid!!! :P
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:41:05
Nice to know I'm not alone though...
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:47:56
already noon time in Asia now
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:08:17
I can't breathe... 1 btc just reached 1M here in my currency...
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:51:16
Philippines ... and now it's back to 940k.. ugh!
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:44:13
Newbie here with a small investment but already in the profit. So far, I have lost $140 (off the profit) since btc started to drop.  Still in the profit though, my invested money has doubled.  I'm trying to be strong and hold... but honestly.. I'm scared...
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:05:44
I don't want btc to go away just like that.. I have grown to love it...
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:04:36
and after 20 mins of dilly dallying the fee is now $34???
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:56:41
Europe wakes up and starts buying... $14,074.13
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:03:52
Like it's now out to trap people's money?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:00:47
Wait for me, dip.  I have to wait til morning before I can buy you :/
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:54:14
Woah!!! That's huge!  I just checked the conversion  1M Php = 269,403,773.08 Indonesian Rupiah!
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:19:01
I'm planning to buy other coins this weekend when it's not very busy.  I'll be needing hand-hodling from you guys because it still confuses me...
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:33:34
or is it going to go down still?
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:51:31
Pardon my ignorance.  Does [this graph]( mean a lot of people are planning to sell? Hence, there's a possible dip?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:06:41
moving up...
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:44:20
My friend bought at 15k, sold at 13k out of fear, and now asking me if she should buy back at 16k .. not only she lost during the drop, she's also losing with high fees... :/
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:33:55
Me too!!!
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:55:14
Asia here.. just as soon as the clock hit 12midnight (new year) btc started to lift off!  good sign for 2018?
Edit:  Happy New Year everyone!!!
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:02:26
And I hope you wake up smiling when you see the price chart first thing in the morning.  You have a good night sleep! :D
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:16:55
No more dip?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:26:23
I only bought a little lol still have funds remaining, will wait some more too!
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:45:05
It happens to me, too! When I buy, it drops lol.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:12:14
Anyone here making the purchase already? or is this still going to go any deeper? I'm already losing sleep waiting lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:10:11
Wish I knew when it's already the bottom...
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:52:55
Thanks to DST!!! I was thinking 6pm EST is 8mins from now!  Yes, I should be able to catch the dip. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:20:12
Thank you! I feel better now :D
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:00:48
My friend sold. I didn't, I'm holding on tight! and ready to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:45:16
Don't worry, I only blame myself for every wrong decision I make lol.  But I like hearing other people's thoughts. I feel somehow relieved knowing I'm not alone.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:35:05
Yes, I can see it coming! :D
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:28:05
going down again... buying some more...
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:08:27
yeah I first bought at 7200, then bought some again when it dropped to 6800... i tried to sell when it's high and bought back when it's low.. i gained very little but very happy... then i tried selling again when i thought it was too high, but got burned lol, it went even higher and i put my money back in, then sold again. then bought again.. I lost big in FEES.. since then, i promised myself I'm just going to hold and just buy some whenever it's low.. just that this slow and steady drop got me into thinking, what if I sold when it was high lol.  but the responses below somehow calmed me.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:53:00
My most recent purchase was from my Christmas bonus!
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:18:44
Yesss, I'll try not to get anxious and just enjoy buying dips!
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:47:28
It's not moving :(
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:39:11
That sudden drop... I feel sick 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:28:32
This week has left me emotionally drained...
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:33:10
Buy now?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:19:46
Thanks for the assurance! Just me being silly.. btc is like more than just an investment to me, it took my mind off the sad stuff.. or maybe it's because I'm new to this so it's giving me the natural high lol. I want it to stay!
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:43:00
please tell until what time and in what timezone?  I won't be able to buy until after 2 hours from now :/
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:30
It's crazy!  I was able to buy somewhere between 15k and 16k. It was moving soooo fast!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:18:33
Crazy ride!
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:36:19
Shopping spree! :D
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:41:29
Yes, I'll try not to go on impulse buying.. I did that a few times, used up the entire available fund and when it went even lower, I'm like !oh no!"
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:28:16
They wake up and sold...
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:20:58
Glad i saw your post!!! Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:47:01
Exactly! lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:13:37
That was my mindset when I bought the first time, only put in the money I can afford to lose. But whenever there's a drop, I'd buy a little bit more.  It's just so hard to not be greedy lol. Thanks for the reminder. I'll try to keep my control! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:40:42
Is this the [GDAX depth chart]( I can't use GDAX but I would like to monitor this chart to make me a bit informed about what's going on. Thanks! :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:19:59
and 13k happened just like that!!! in just a few mins!  now at 12k!
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:43:49
I'm so tempted right now...
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:56:36
haha yeah, I wanted to tell her buy and not look anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:06:46
I'm also waiting for another dip...
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:57:42
bought at 6700... can't help it...
