I wouldn’t be so sure about that. We are around. Just watching the man drama and zeroing in on the information worth retaining... quietly. Carry on!

I went to dinner with my entire family. I hadn’t planned on paying for it. But after my brother started to discuss Bitcoin and it’s “crashing” last week. And his remarks about it being a “ponzi scheme” and people being “suckers”, between many chuckles, I decided to give everyone a little knowledge of my own. 
I paid for the entire bill. They were like, “no, you shouldn’t do that.” And although in my mind I was like... you’re right. I shouldn’t. But as my brother thinks he’s so smart, I said, “While we have been at this table for the last 2 hours eating dinner, and having some laughs about a market  you all know nothing about, I’ve made enough to pay for this bill. Merry Christmas.”  
Immediately the cousins were like... “Really? How, tell me more.”  
I just told them to “stop listening to main stream media bullshit and read up on it. The crypto market is much bigger than you think and not just about money. It’s about the future and technology.” 
My brother was all of a sudden silent. 
I’m sure I’ll get some phone calls tomorrow.

Yeah, he’s been going at it passive aggressively all week on facebook. His comments at dinner were just another slight at me and I was tired of trying to talk since into him and explain my choices to get involved. The rest of the family were just beneficiaries of my spat with him. Besides, it was money I had planned to spend on a New Years trip that I had to cancel a few days ago due to work. So it wasn’t really a loss in anyway.

Point totally missed on you. And I’m not surprised. 
There is a difference between being sarcastically funny and just being a dick. You have certainly mastered being a dick. The worst kind that hides behind a computer screen to do so.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this �� 
With so many people making more than they know what to do with, via bitcoin or the old fashioned way. I just love philanthropy. And what a great way to add value to this currency at the same time? You’re awesome!!! Thank you for being so generous. I would do the same if I were in your shoes.

So, my 77 year old Mom, who now follows crypto news because she’s curious to know what I’m doing, even though she knows nothing about technology or investing. She called me in a panic because she saw Bitcoin had fallen to $15k in the news and urged me to sell. “Sweetie, I heard something is happening with those blocks and bits, please get out now!” She said. 
She’s so cute. I giggled. 
“Mom, I bought at $1,750, and when Asia wakes up in their morning, they will see that it’s a great time to buy. I’m gonna HODL. If it hits $2k, then I’ll sell so that I walk away with my initial investment and know that it’s been a fun and exciting year.”
