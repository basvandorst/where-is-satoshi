You are fucking annoying and a fool.  That's why.
@_date: 2014-03-16 05:10:25
Fuck off.
@_date: 2014-03-05 08:49:19
Just stop.  You are more annoying than Darkwings.

Thanks, Andreas!

I'm curious to know how many people portraying Bitcoin technology in a negative way also donate to religion.  Religion is, after all, the mother of corruption and false promises.

Dude, I'm not quite certain what your malfunction is.  I do know, however, that I checked my computer at ~10:30 AM PST and you have been going strong for nearly 10 hours spouting your nonsense.
Give it a rest.
@_date: 2014-03-24 03:01:45
Nahh.  Hardly mad.  I feel sorry for you.  It's a shame that you are paid to do what you do all day pretty much everyday.  If you aren't paid, that's even worse.
Life is pretty short and you're wasting it on this...?  Your choice, obviously.

It's all relative and subject to adoption.  As the number of BTC users increases, the percentage of individuals who own 1 BTC or more vs those who own less decreases &amp; increases respectively, thereby placing anyone with at least 1 whole coin in the top .9%, .8%, .7%, etc as time &amp; adoption progresses.
@_date: 2014-01-13 04:48:01
Why won't you go away?  You need to see a psychiatrist.
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:48:36
I have nothing of consequence to say to you.  I have more important things to do with my time &amp; I laugh every time you insinuate a lack of intelligence on my part.

2 Jews have a convo related to an idiotic article that circulated Reddit yesterday.
iPhones cost more than BTC right now (especially after you factor in the 2 year commitment which is generally required) and I'd wager she's on her 2nd.
Fame seeking nothing to see here.

In this case, this is a new global currency.  Things are treated much differently when money is the focus.  Also, when the inventions you listed came into being, the Internet was hardly as ubiquitous as it is now or didn't even exist when they were created, as you know.

This comparison is invalid.  Bitcoin is a protocol.  Myspace &amp; Facebook are apps that use the TCP/IP protocol.  
bitcoin (small b) is the 1st app on the Bitcoin protocol.
For all the time you spend posting bullshit, you should have this down by now.

Stop posting this shit (not just you).  There have been at least 2 dozen in the past 24 hours.

Many seem to miss the protocol piece and that BTC can currently be considered an unofficial IPO.  This especially includes that Darkwing fucktard.

I suggested you see a psychiatrist weeks ago...   If you have, please stick with it.  These things take time...
When I see your _08 tag or read anything similar to your writing style, I think back to people who laughed at the iPhone, due to shoulder surfing and passwords, and people who criticized/mocked the iPad.  There is no direct comparison to be made between BTC and Apple's tech.  The point is, you are simply ignorant just like the the people who mocked those innovations.
Whatever your motivation is for posting here constantly makes no difference.  Your schtick is old.

We're on the interwebz.  There is no need for me to be cordial, erudite, graceful, etc. especially when it's a thread centered on tulipfutures (AKA Darkwings_08).

Can you or anyone else explain the math behind the random generation in layman's terms?  I apologize for not understanding how this part works.  This is what I cannot seem to understand, for example:  If 3 million people all booted to an Ubuntu Live instance with no network connection and all created wallets simultaneously using Bitcoin-QT, what is it about how wallets are created with no connection to the Blockchain that ensures that nobody out of those 3 million have the same key/address generated?
@_date: 2014-03-21 05:54:39
Do my magic words such as fucktard bother you?  You are wrong.  Deal with it.
What is fucking pathetic is virtually every time I read the comments for a goddamn article on this subreddit, there you are.  I'm beginning to think you are darkwings.
@_date: 2014-03-21 05:49:53
An absolute child, you say?  Your analogy was wrong.  Deal with it.  Fucktard.
