It's not almost zero at all but assuming it is, what's the point of holding Bitcoin if you're just going to convert it back to fiat when you want to buy something? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of the entire currency?

What? If Bitcoin becomes an accepted currency then it will be used for "waste and wars" also. The electrical usage of mining is one of the biggest problems of Btc

What does this even mean? You can spend more with dollars because you can't buy anywhere near the same selection of goods with Bitcoin currently

You're a good guy. I'd say karma will help you out but it probably doesn't exist. Still, nice work lol

Christ you're a dick. He's completely right and you call him mentally disabled? You must be a hit at parties that you never get invited to

Well that's ridiculous. Also it's 100 times easier to spend a dollar than a bitcoin right now so you're not being entirely honest about your spending options under either currency

It's funny how stating an obvious fact in this sub like "it is more difficult to spend a Bitcoin right now" will get you downvoted. 
You can't take out and repay debt in Btc. You can't buy 99% of consumer goods with Btc. You're completely right in saying it's harder.
