I think there are probably less than 200k active bitcoin users. Somewhere between 100k and 200k.

I was thinking the other day.. the DDOSes could be being done to make sure all bitcoin services are behind DDOS protection - it creates an excellent monitoring choke point for all bitcoin services.
Once there it will be easier for spy agencies to monitor them.. since the SSL is usually terminated at cloudflare and maybe prolexic  - it's possible that all our account info goes cleartext and is intercepted somewhere between these DDOS mitigators and the bitcoin services they're "protecting".. that way the authorities can collect a bunch of information about which bitcoin addresses are associated with which accounts by recording form submissions... just a paranoid thought for everyone :)

The blockchain (as of 6am this morning) and

There are around 200k bitcoin addresses containing 1 BTC or more. Some of them probably belong to the same people.
The number of addresses grows to around 300k addresses with a balance of 0.1BTC or more (again some belonging to the same people).
There are around 100k users registered on bitcointalk.org - I think this is actually close to the number of active bitcoin users who have more than a trivial amount of bitchange.

maybe less.. I'm sure there are a lot of abandoned accounts on bitcointalk.org - and I'm probably not the only one to have 4 or 5 active btc addresses. It's definitely early stages.
