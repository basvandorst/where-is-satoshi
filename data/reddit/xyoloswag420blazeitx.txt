I mean outside of extreme values (ie, I make $20,000 a year or I  just cashed a bonus check for $4M) your socioeconomic status is just as dependent on your location as it is how much you make.
I've personally never been to London but the people I know who have say it is the most expensive place they have ever visited. My friends and I live about an hour away from New York City, if London is even remotely as expensive than I can assure you there are places where a rich man could move from and become middle class in London very easily.

Exactly. I'm a libertarian and I'm behind the ideas of Bitcoin 100%. I'm also not a moron and I know a good deal about finance, I simply cannot find a reason to put my money into Bitcoin as either a currency or investment vehicle.  There are a lot of ideas I'm behind but I need to actually see something (quite literally *something*) attractive about a product before I'll put my capital into it. Sure I think fiat currency is less than ideal but it doesn't change the fact that I have to buy my food with US dollars. Putting my massive life savings of $6,000 and my expert backing as a 22 year old grad student in physics behind BTC isn't really going to do shit in the scheme of things other than open me up to what I fully believe will be 100% losses.

A rational investor makes marginal decisions on their positions and ignores the sunken cost of obtaining those positions originally.

Never, literally never, assume that someone is too intelligent to do something.

You are going to continue to squander a sum of many most would gave a leg to have and fuck your sister out of an inheritance is what you're going to do.

May I ask what exactly you think arbitrage is?
