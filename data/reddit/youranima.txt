This is not an ad, this is news with a comedy perspective from an agency looking to build traction for their brand outside of the work they produce for clients.

Do you solve major pain points like celebrity nude photos being leaked, political transparency or even, perhaps, creating art?
Cheers.

This is something I'm extremely passionate about. Truly, this idea is the main reason why I was drawn into my role at ChangeTip.
I'm very close with quite a few people who reside in the states and are trying to help their families survive in their countries of origin by sending money back home. Have you all looked into the fees these humans have to incur just to do this transfer? Injustice. Such constraints are outrageous and serve to disempower entire nations who have become victims of a global arbitrage. I believe Bitcoin is one of the core elements which will empower and impact underdeveloped and developing economies to grow in the right direction. Such areas will also be more likely to quickly adopt Bitcoin as they have higher incentive with lower value currency and financial systems who are is less established. 
I'm trying to solve this problem with ChangeTip. I believe that if we can connect with these organizations, from Kiva to UNICEF to TED to ONE to DoSomething.org, we can empower each person who subscribes to the philosophies of these organizations to donate money through ChangeTip in an attempt to fund a larger human purpose for equality.
I've already reached out to several charities/NGO's/non-profits but it seems like we'll have to do something different to drive these groups to adopt Bitcoin. You don't get extraordinary results with ordinary strategy and I'm ready to take the most fearless, strategically managed action we can to bring these truths to the light of day for these groups.
How do you think we can work together to speed up the process of making this dream a reality?

An NGO exists to destroy itself. The point of these organizations is to solve a problem and once these people are helped, the system will find another challenge to take on. 
With any investment, you need to diversify. If we all want to invest our time and energy into solving this problem, the answer is not as simple as donating all of our time and energy into one form of charity.

Hey Justin, 
Are you planning to do anything to help users who are locked out of their account while the market is at a high, who are prevented from making a trade? If you are going to be the Uber of bitcoin (I'm referring to the cutthroat attitude), their customer service immediately compensates users for bad experiences, instead of leaving them with 5 day wait times for a response and big missed opportunities. 
Reminder: robots will replace many jobs. The future of work is based on empathy, creativity, and fundamentally, being human. When a company in SV lacks excellent customer service, I must say I feel they miss the point. 
Cheers.
