Thanks, it's a start, and now I have a bitcoin wallet! This whole idea is really amazing, but also very confusing, I seem to have gotten most of everything sorted out. I guess what makes it hard is all the wallet addresses look so complex it's hard to get a mental grasp of everything, and the whole idea is just so new it is rather daunting. Never really done anything finical before, like stock market finical, so all of this is really new to me and lots of new concepts.

Thanks, I was wanting to keep what I make off mining 50/50, maybe I should look into middlecoin and just mine that and dogecoin at the same time? Have two instances going at once? I guess I could also look into these exchanges.

So if I got one of these I wouldn't have to worry about waiting for it to be confirmed? That was one of my big concerns, how do I know if someone paid before they leave?

Okay thanks, yes I'm using CPU mining right now until I can figure out GPU mining.

I am still keeping dogecoin as well, I'm trying to keep it roughly 50/50. As bitcoin seems to be going lower and lower right now it seems like the best time to buy is now as I'm sure it will go back up eventually, as I am sure dogecoin will go up as well.

Wow that's great that these two businesses are coming up together at the same time, seems like a perfect pairing.
