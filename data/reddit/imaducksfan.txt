@_date: 2017-11-16 22:07:59
There’s an IOS APP called coinATMradar
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:09:32
Just have better spending habits! Iv learned now that I put money into crypto currencies I’m less likely to spend “stupid money” because I feel like I’m wasting money I could be investing. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:23:20
I mean it’s really identical though. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:05:22
Don’t be some easily manipulated Ciabbata
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:17:31
Yeah that’s why you never tell people on the internet how much you have if it’s a big amount 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:00:30
Only ethereum is working for me
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:11:00

@_date: 2017-11-21 20:08:00
Twitter, instagram, Groupon, Amazon. Yeah totally all fads hahah what?
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:52:55
Feel like 23 is the perfect age to get into crypto! Young enough to fully reap the benefits and old enough to afford to buy some
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:34:40
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:27:58
Am I the only one that thinks this will hurt our rep? A dumb wizard won’t make us seem legit to the outside world...
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:38:08
Pshhh 3k was the first big early adoption price! You are not to late by a long shot! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:28:37
Also a girl. Lol Woops! 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:03:16
Say you paid 100$ for some bitcoins and the price was 6800$ when you placed the payment. Now if the price goes up to 7700 while the funds are becoming available then yes you will receive like 115$ when you get those bitcoins. Make sense? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:07:36
Just a sparkle
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:20:00
Yeah I wouldn’t do that but who knows. Right?
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:55:40
Explain ��
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:00:42
 But like all dropping and pumping back up the SAME exact way? Wierd.
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:48:40
What am I looking for?
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:54:06
Oh is that what happened??
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:21:29
In all honesty I think it’s that BTC coin is alittle but bigger than BCH coin 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:04:13
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:02:06
She’s easier to store and transfer around the world!
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:16:20
Okay but this is reddit. Not Wall Street Journal, People would think this is a bigger joke. It screams “unprofessional teenager”  Idunno. I just don’t get it
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:55:40
Same. I’m 23, you?
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:18:41

@_date: 2017-11-16 22:07:08
Bitcoin ATM
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:11:38
Sometimes the fees are high though like 6-12%
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:24:21
How’d you guess;)
@_date: 2018-11-05 17:32:49
Who’s face is that in the top corner ��
@_date: 2018-02-20 04:17:23
Lol this puts things into perspective 
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:45:29
I think bitcoin was 4000$ish at that point 
@_date: 2018-12-05 00:48:08
So you are willing to hand over your power over your own  money because you are scared you can’t do it correctly? Yikes
