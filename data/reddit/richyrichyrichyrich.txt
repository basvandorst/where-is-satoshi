Actually, most of it is open source. Just a small portion isn't. They blame that on copycat software developers.

Libra coin turning government's heavily against Crypto. 
Bitcoin developed naturally and slowly, allowing people to adjust. Libra seems more like an attempt at world dominance. Government's will fight back and the consequences will affect all Cryptocurrency's.

Forking bitcoin isn't solving the problem. It's the same as printing money. Let's put greed aside and work together!

They may be used for that at times. However there are far greater products on the market than Bitcoin. It was a fantastic invention but like everything when given enough time, it will be replaced by a superior product. There are already many. You can't cling onto nostalgia forever.

I'm sorry to say but I agree with everything you've said. There is no way governments will go down without an almighty fight. Do people honestly think that we can just walk up and take control of our money? They have started wars, killing hundreds of thousands to keep the USD the ruling currency. There is absolutely no limit to what they will do to ultimately own and be able to trace your money.

Monero = more private
IOTA = cheaper
Vertcoin = the people's coin
Ethereum = faster
Dash = a great all-rounder. 
Honestly as a product I loved bitcoin but now I'm out. It, as a product has lost its way because of the greed and immaturity of its developers. There are so many coins that are better with all aspects. It's not even worth arguing. 
Bitcoin has a great name and is popular but is purely a store of wealth. It's almost unusable. 
I'm not trying to argue with you but unless you end this Bitcoin vs its forks war you will all dissolve.

Ethereum is faster
Monero is more private 
IOTA is cheaper to use
Vertcoin is all of the above and a people based coin compared to BTC and its forks
And dash is also all round better. 
BTC is the most expensive to use and the slowest. It's not private at all. It's controlled by big mining groups and is no longer for the people. 
I'm sorry, I loved BTC for a very long time but it is failing and I'm out. All it has left is a good name and popularity.

This is something I've been thinking about quiet a bit recently. With cryptocurrency prices seemingly at rock bottom. What happens when the cost of mining outweighs the income generated from mining? 
As an extreme thought...   Is it possible the entire system will collapse at these super low prices?

Tipping has a shameful history. We have enough of that in Australia...

No fiat currency has lasted forever. Eventually, they all fail.
BTC will be replaced one day also. Now that currency will be technology based I believe that there will constantly be new and improved ideas.

Yes, when you add a coin you add it as a pair. For example if you add Walton you add it as WTC/BTC or WTC/USD or WTC/ETH etc.....

Ha, love it!!! 
Great question!! 
@_date: 2018-04-23 01:24:31
You have to add the pair you want to view.

I'm pretty sure Blockfolio does actually. I add any coin paying with any currency and multiple coins. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 08:08:40
Gotta get in first...  We should trust them more!
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:02:55

It really is quite simple. Have a play with it.
