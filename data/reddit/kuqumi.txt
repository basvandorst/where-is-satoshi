I talked with an EFF guy at DragonCon this year, and he said they know that Amazon has a little money for them, but they haven't actually claimed it yet. I didn't find out if the issue was technical or procedural. If you want to make a much more significant difference, you can [make a donation with BTC on their website]( Even a small direct donation will make a much bigger and more immediate difference than the tiny Amazon auto-donations.

Good point. I'm still looking for a "light" desktop wallet that supports BIP0032 and BIP0038. For now, as an alternative to writing down the seed, you can store it as a gpg-encrypted file.
I guess the only open question for me is: can you recover the seed from an Electrum installation without knowing the password?
Edit: electrum.org says that the seed is stored encrypted. So I dunno. It might be safe.

That money comes from credit card fees charged to the merchant. Merchants raise their prices to cover the fees, so we all pay more for that merchant's products in order to finance your credit card bonus. The credit cards with cash back also charge the highest fees.

Might as well bet on it not happening! Just denominate the bet in the currency in question. :P

The deflation caused by destroying that currency is distributed evenly among everyone with bitcoin, so in a sense we all benefited slightly.

Some wallets like Electrum don't stay unlocked, but require a password from you for every transaction. Definitely a good feature to have if you're worried about someone busting down the door at a carefully chosen moment.

Not every father can pull that off though. It's hard to do so fewer people do it.

Definitely. I think that's why a major portion of stuff priced in bitcoin is either (a) not safe to sell in fiat, due to legal or privacy concerns or (b) themed around bitcoin itself.

Weekly? The easiest way might be to use [Bitwage]( They give you a bank account number and you can set up a direct deposit to it. If the money doesn't come from a payroll that could be a challenge. *I don't know if there are practical or legal obstacles*, but maybe you could initiate direct deposits on your own using a direct deposit service like an employer would. I found  after [a quick search](
Edit: I contacted Bitwage support and in their reply they said


So you might only have to wait a week or so for this ability. Nice.
Edit 2: Further clarification from Bitwage and researching this stuff seems to make it clear that using Bitwage as an exchange gives you or them (or both) legal problems since they are classified as a payroll company and not an exchange. I'm not a lawyer so be responsible with your choices.

If he's on Windows, consider using a program like the free [Piriform Recuva]( to scan for a wallet.dat file in the empty space on the hard drive.
If you want a better chance of success, consider paying a professional, who will take the hard drive out of the laptop and examine it with more effective and non-destructive tools. Maybe you can find someone who would take payment contingent on recovering a wallet file.

Bitcoin is digital money based on ~~encryption~~ cryptography, with no central authority. Balances are recorded on a giant ledger that everyone has, and you can spend your balance with a computer or cellphone. New currency is divided among people who run programs to maintain the ledger.

I read about GreenAddress instant transactions, but I share some of the concerns voiced here: [(Centralization issues with the GreenAddress.it instant confirmation BIP 70 extension proposal? Let's discuss.)]( If I want to do zero-conf in a GreenAddress world, I need to keep a list of centralized wallet providers whose zero-conf assurances I trust. Or maybe those providers need GreenAddress's blessing to use their assurance. Either way, trust is centralized.
My understanding of the DRK approach is that instant transactions are approved by a consensus of masternodes randomly picked from the pool, and masternodes that don't play nice lose rep and get banned or ignored or something.  
The instant lock is just a way for the masternodes to say, yeah, this transaction will reach N confirmations. And to make sure, we will keep holding it in its instant confirmed state until the blockchain catches up with our claim.  
The masternodes collect a little bit of extra fee for their additional work, and then the transaction ends up in the blockchain same as ever.

As long as you followed the first rule of investing in volatile commodities!
"Only put in what you can afford to lose."
Personally, except if someone somehow breaks the protocol, I would ride the BTC elevator to the bottom floor, and then buy some more. Because I feel like BTC is the currency of the future. I suspect that those of us here are mostly coming from the technology enthusiast side rather than the financial investment side of things. I've never traded penny stocks, for example.
**tl;dr**: Yes, just hold. Set a threshold for yourself where if it goes this cheap, you'll buy some more. Keep doing that until the price starts to recover.
