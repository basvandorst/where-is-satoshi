Probably still counts if but if it somehow had a 50% quitting rate it’s still good for adoption . Anyone who disagrees is an asshole

Higher prices lead to more adoption by the masses  which lead to more value and advancements . 
Price is very important and always shitted on. Most newcomers that stay  long term fans jump into the crypto when it’s at the high point .

The only reason I would think this is good is because every time T_D boycotts whatever trump says to it almost usually means they will hit an all time high and never works .

I️ run a very large eBay / Amazon third party business for 15 years with close to 8 figure sales this year 
eBay will have zero chance of success with this unless they have outside help or buy an established company that can integrate it for them .
Anytime eBay tried to innovate or do ANYTHING tech related they are terrible at it .  They have so many issues with their search feature and algorithms that have been plaguing them for years stalling growth , they have no catalog and keep trying to “ be amazon” when they can’t . 
Amazon is the only chance for this to happen and Amazon loves big risk for big rewards

Not to be a dick but if 2 parties can’t figure out how PayPal works ( one of the easiest things ever ) or how to do a bank transfer then you should be worried . They are years away from being able to use bitcoin or even thinking about using / trusting bitcoin for real life situations like this .

In the USA and most Places it’s one of the easiest most User friendly apps a beginner can download and not get confused . They also have a massive amount of income that they will eventually use to advertise ( without more adoption prices and fees won’t go

Zero chance for either of them . Normal Dems , Republicans , the rich , the media , the elite all don’t want Warren or Bernie to win.

Mass adoption will take 10x longer without massive price movement . 
You need headlines , new companies , news articles , advertising dollars like coinbase and Gemini are doing . these don’t happen without high prices and surges .  Almost everyone I personally know with crypto still bought in at the 2017 peaks u
Get out of this naive mind set that price doesn’t matter .  It’s the most important thing for mass adoption

If there is a bad recession ( with mass firings ) people need cash so they will sell guaranteed . A majority of the people here sound like they got a couple thousand worth ( people get super excited when they hit 1 coin ) . 
If someone like this is living “ paycheck to paycheck” or close to it with minimal savings once they get fired they are going to liquidate  which much of the world does live by . 
The only way this doesn’t happen is if institutional holders actually hold or keep buying . It’s relatively new for them so no one knows if they will scare liquidate or what .

First line is completely wrong . It causes us to go to other places like India or Taiwan . A very very small portion of people are leaving and manufacturing in the USA from the tariffs .  For huge companies like Apple let’s say they have the money to invest and build a factory from scratch in the USA if they choose ( but they won’t  because we don’t have space labor ) small and medium businesses don’t have that ability and it doesn’t work with a flip of a switch .  Even Nike said their sourcing and manufacturing would take years to switch from China to another country and needs to planned

The alerts and suspicion from depositing 50k doesn’t mean shit Or matter if you have a valid reason or trail to show where the money is .
It’s a common misconception that if you deposit or withdraw over 10k you are on some sort of watch list . Bank won’t care or report you if you speak to them beforehand and let them know you wanna withdraw 50k cash soon .
Cops might seize your money in many states ... but you are thinking extreme worst case scenario that if you get pulled over you do something to have that cop search your trunk .

Maybe not destroy but I am shocked people aren’t even a little bit scared Libra can either fuck up the idea of crypto for everyone if they do something stupid on a grand scale . So many people think Facebook is evil and regardless of your thoughts the majority of people ( not in these small communities ) will think Libra=bitcoin=crypto and they are all the same . 
That’s the worst case scenario but best case is Facebook makes it more mainstream and prices skyrocket

Major question here ... if coinbase got hacked or scammed everyone’s money then it would probably crash the price so bad . I rather get my money back from them and rebuy honestly .
Everyone hates coinbase but it’s the most well known and the media would be in such a panic prices would die
@_date: 2019-06-10 21:54:02
The point is that eventually if enough people ask the business will say “ maybe I should look into this it’s the 20th person to ask “ then there is a chance they turn into a supporter or holder themselves .   The first few times they will either ignore obviously or give a “ thank you for your suggestion and we will look into this for the future “ maybe next bull run they will be like now it’s time to accept it . That’s how adoption works and the conversion rate is probably really fucking low

Banks close accounts of conservatives and liberals every day . Do idiots really think at billion dollar companies there is a department of humans geared towards “ let’s find accounts of loud political people we hate and close it down “. It’s all automated by bots and yes there might be one jerkoff who does randomly take out his personal agenda but it’s not a widespread issue to say banks in general are attacking conservatives . 
Ask anyone who does business on amazon or eBay where there is a huge rise in suspensions and shut downs of multi million dollar sellers . All the shut downs are done by algorithms / robots that rarely have justification other than something triggered it . Appealing most the time
Does nothing 
The conservatives get shut down because people are reporting it a lot .
