Nobody else does either. Anyone who claims to be needs to be a time traveler or blatantly lying to you. Again, Your Decision. Personally, I hope its the Facebook..

So was twitter, but they finally made their first profits just recently..

Critics themselves are just meant to find flaws and move on, not see what it can become. They are just a judge, one momentary speck in time. Not determining past nor future unless critic holds value.

Oh no, i understand Tesla's' deficiencies.. I was just stating that a lot of investors don't mind the lack of profit. Lack of profit does not correlate to a pump. You can choose other indicators for a pump, but predicting the fall of a pump because of lack of profits doesn't work..

This. This is so important. You can tell just by the comments who is a newbie and who is an old timer. Just FOUR months ago if you had invested, you would still be up. You still wouldve made gains. Just have to look at it from perspective. Its just newbies who have been stating that bitcoin is gonna fall and going to crash. I cant find any people from early 2017 or even earlier saying that this is the end of bitcoin... Might want to think about why..

I think of it like the government. Just because they are in trillions of dollars in debt doesnt mean nobody has faith in them. They allow the government to continue going in debt because it indicates enough of a future where the debt is irrelevant. For that reason, it provides stability in the economy.
Likewise, the fact Tesla has no profit does not determine the outcome. The rising marketcap shows hope in the future, and a drive to believe that the profits will make debts irrelevant. One can say its troublesome, but one can say the future is more exciting because of that. Despite this, history will be rewritten by the victor, and us two to do not determine who that is..

True, but most people entering crypto now do not understand how to do that, nor have the drive to. Most.

That is because it is small time frame. 2 months is a very short time..

Honestly, it is your choice. I would hodl, but your choice in the end. If you feel bitcoin is going to crash, your investment choice. If you feel optimistic, go ahead and try to hodl. Best of luck in whichever avenue  you go in. 
I know my reply probably didn't help, but taking advice from strangers over the internet is quite a bit risky, especially on currency that has no physical token..

Pro Tip: Nobody truly knows. 
Unless we have a few time traveling redditors ~_~.

Thats pretty amazing that that is what you understood from my statement. You must be seeing things I didnt even write. I didnt mention anything about what future price will be, just said to think about other peoples perspectives. But you can see what you want to see :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:24:53
A lot of people have. There is an entire subreddit of people living off crypto and they give each other plenty of tips and stuff of how to continue..

The exchange is the mediator.
On Market Exchanges, the person who is buying from you gives you the sell. Vice Versa Applies.

"Its Official" Eh.. Alright. I'm gonna sell all my crypto because of your excellent and official advice. Thanks for your input! s/
Edit: Jeez, people really dont like sarcasm.. xD
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:10:43
Hell no, but that doesn't stop others from doing it. Thats all I am trying to say. You and I can try to know what we are doing, but so many people bought into crypto when they didnt know.

"What do people do when they face too much bad news?"
"Go into denial.. Seeing doesn't mean believing, no matter what people say. Convincing a person in denial is bloody difficult, if not impossible. Hopefully the world won't stay in denial for long, but for now lets claim the right to say *'I Told You So'*."
Just Thought I Should Leave This Quote...

Sadly that sentiment does not follow with all of the crypto community..
