They should also stop portraying bitcoin as similar to stocks. Its a currency.

Most of the advisory discusses the risks consumers are exposed to, from criminals such as hackers and scam artists, to transaction costs that would make banks and credit card issuers blush. In addition, the CFPB made passing reference to bitcoin's stability, or lack of it, as a store of value.
I love when a "news" company uses there own references to make a claim or statement about something :D Also What fees are these fee's they are speaking of? Blockchain states in their wallet overview "**No additional transaction fees. A bitcoin network fee may apply, but is optional.**" I assume they mean the fee's to transfer money from a bank account into bitcoin. Well Circle.com states on their front page "**You shouldn't have to pay fees to use your own money. We don't charge fees when you convert funds to or from bitcoin with a linked bank account, when you store your bitcoin, or for bitcoin transactions.**"
..I'm not ever going to bother with the criminal, hacker, scam artist shit. Yes we all know some companies have scammed people buying bitcoin and some people have been hacked but for the majority of people who use bitcoin for personal or minuscule things, they are not being targeted.
