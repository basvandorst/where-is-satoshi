I wish I had 1400 VTC :-0

But the hardware developers could only put X amount of memory in their ASIC, right? So, as long as N &gt; X via a hardfork, it would render the ASIC useless. At some point, via software, we can make N &gt; X.
That might eventually render GPU mining useless and leave us with CPU mining if I am thinking about that correctly.

How is that different from any change devs make to any coin, including BTC? Updates to benefit the ecosystem are totally normal. You are trusting the BTC developers as well.

Nice work! Do you plan to open source the iOS code?

While Vertcoin *could* suffer the same problems, it seems to have pretty good P2P usage so far. It was initially encouraged by offering an out of the box P2P node that could merge mine. The traditional pools had to scramble to implement that in stratum to keep up with the market.

There is **no causality there**... being ASIC resistant does not cause botnets. 
It might be a choice between ASICs and the *possibility* of botnet mining; then your choice really boils down to the *certainty* hash power will be consolidated by the few with money to invest in ASIC(s) - not just pools, entities - and the possibility of a botnet mining your coin. I would take ASIC resistance any day. Because ultimately, the little guy still remains in the picture for longer. 
This is not just about distribution of hash power... it is about the distribution of the currency itself.

Anyway, maybe they will think up an ASIC that can scale with N, who knows, but it won't happen for a while. Even if the price increased, it would be a tricky investment for ASIC manufactures knowing about the looming hard fork. Likewise, people who would buy the ASIC would be worried it would only work short term and may not spend all that money to buy one. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:34:30
That is not a strong argument in favor of ASICs. So you are saying that centralizing the hash power is better than potentially rogue app developers making a botnet? ASIC resistance doesn't entice people to create a botnet.
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:35:10
The issues are mutually exclusive. ASIC resistance does not lead to botnets. The risk is there regardless. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:11:31
Vertcoin doesn't have a botnet issue any more than other coins that aren't ASIC mined. It is possible, but I prefer the chance of a problem with a botnet to certainty of short term ASIC production.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:53:35
How does it lead to more problems?
@_date: 2014-06-14 01:34:04
Yup.... then ASIC is built, hard fork occurs, N factor &gt; X memory, ASIC is useless...
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:43:47
I don't think the situation would play out that way. The great thing about scrypt-n is exactly what you described - ASICs suddenly become obsolete. The economics of that would prevent people from investing in ASICs to start with. So, let's say 1 company pays lots of money to develop the ASIC for scrypt-n for a n factor that is higher than the current n value. Who is going to buy one of those knowing the coin will hard fork to an n value that destroys that ASIC? No one would buy an expensive ASIC with that kind of uncertainty because ASIC mining is about long(er) term profitability.
Your second point does not make sense. Scrypt-n is not slow to verify. Verification speed is set by the adaptation of the difficulty. If the network hashrate skyrockets, the difficulty will go up and the blocks will be verified at roughly the same rate. Likewise, if all the ASICs were to be rendered useless, the hashrate would drop, and the difficulty would be re-targeted to have the save block verification time. Algorithm difficulty has nothing to do with block solve difficulty.

Yes, but those farms are still not as cost efficient as an ASIC. In fact, we do have GPU farms mining Vertcoin currently. I have no problem with that. 
It is nice that small timers who don't have all the initial capital to invest can still mint coins leading to a broader distribution. That is the other problem that needs to be solved. 
You are correct that pools still exist on Vertcoin and the 51% attach is still possible. We are lucky that the community has really taken to P2P mining. I think Vertcoin has the highest percentage of P2P mining. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:53:20
Right. You are correct that being ASIC resistant doesn't necessarily guarantee decentralization of hashing power. An ASIC resistant coin could have a pool with 51% of the hash power. 
But, keeping small time GPU miners in the picture for longer does help the distribution of the block rewards which is also good for the coin.
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:46:26
I don't refute that point. ASICs are not impossible to create for scrypt-n, but the economics (regardless of the price of the coin) make it unlikely people will buy those ASICs. From my response to another user:
"So, let's say 1 company pays lots of money to develop the ASIC for scrypt-n for a n factor that is higher than the current n value. Who is going to buy one of those knowing the coin will hard fork to an n value that destroys that ASIC?

Vertcoin - highest P2P usage, ASIC *resistant* (@_date: 2014-06-13 18:13:45
Hardfork in the case ASICs come to market, yes, that is the commitment the Vertcoin dev team and community has made - it is not based on authority. The issue has been discussed at length with a broader community.
My bad on the verification piece. You are correct. I wonder what the time to verification would be at a given n value.... Interesting point.
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:21:31
Um... what? How does that lead to Botnets?
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:17:06
We have been discussing this over on the Vertcoin subreddit (I appreciate your unbiased viewpoint. I would expect no less from an intelligent developer.
We have a pretty good level of P2P usage thus far. What are your thoughts on scrypt-n (the algo that Vertcoin uses)?
@_date: 2014-06-13 23:07:04
True true... The problem is definitely possible, just not currently an issue. Looks like problems either way. I prefer the risk of a botnet to the certainty of ASIC farms that take hashing away from the little guys.
