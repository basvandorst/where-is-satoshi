I didn't say that governments gave value to gold, I said they based their currency on the value of gold adopted by markets...and such a foundation required that the governments keep a certain stash of gold on hand to redeem for the currency in circulation.  
  
Also, the gold standard does deflate expansion because you can't issue more currency to finance further growth if you don't have the gold on hand to finance the expansion. If we were still on the gold standard, the Fed wouldn't be able to use Quantitative Easing to help stimulate the economy into expansion.

Funny little story of my career life: I used to not care about banks when I was younger, I figured "they're the guys that hold my money for me..."  
  
Then I went to college and graduated with a degree in economics, and I learned how banking *really* works and how they are a catalyst that widens the inequality between the rich and the poor by providing those with immense capital a means by which they prey on the poor.  
  
After I graduated, I searched and searched for a job to no avail...finally getting *one single* interview for a job......at a bank. I landed the job, now I work at an evil bank...but at least it's a job, right? Only now I've learned how truly evil they are looking at the whole situation from the inside and it makes me sick.  
  
I've been applying for other jobs for over a year with no success, I don't want to be working here but I have to support my wife and child somehow. But even I look forward to the coming financial system shakeup that is due to the onset of bitcoin adoption.  
  
Having only just jumped onto the bitcoin ship, I realize I'm a newcomer and only have a few mBtc to my wallet, but one day I'll look back on this part of my life and realize how Bitcoin saved me from the monstrosity that's invaded our financial lives.  
  
For now, I mine my little 190kH/s for middlecoin.com on my sad little gtx660 ti, patiently waiting for the next phone call to be an interview for a job a little less evil.

Gold is a commodity whose value is based on the scarcity of its resource (also, because it has characteristics of value...such as being shiny). In the past, government currencies were based on their acquired or accumulated wealth in the form of gold storage and so their money circulation was dependant on possession of this commodity. However, this made it difficult for countries who were modernizing or industrializing their economies because they could not finance exponential growth from linear acquisition of gold, and so currency valuation was switched from literal storage of gold to a system of faith in government and its ability to pay off the debts.  
  
The reason why bitcoin is a commodity rather than a currency is because of its intrinsic value and limited supply. It's traded on an open exchange, investors buy or sell according to their own valuations and thus as a commodity stock the value of bitcoin rises and falls quite drastically from day to day. There is a definite parallel to the valuation of bitcoin and the valuation of gold stocks, and I think a widely perceived acknowledgement that bitcoin *does* have value but as a commodity rather than a currency. Just because it's freely transferrable between private members doesn't make it a currency, I could take little gold pieces to my neighbor and transfer ownership just as easily...but that doesn't make it a currency.  
  
Personally, I'm fine with bitcoin as a commodity. I think once it's finally realized, the valuation of bitcoin as a commodity will actually increase its value as expected.

Whenever I trade stocks in my trading account, I'm always reminded of an interview with Warren Buffet. The interviewer said "I'm going to say a word, and you say the first thing that comes to mind....BUY!" and Buffet said,"Hold!"  
  
That completely changed how I looked at my investment strategy, and now I'm perfectly content to invest in stocks of value when I know they will take off in the long run...even if they look dire in the short run. The Stock Market can break an emotional investor, the only real way to beat the game is through logic and reason...and math.

Do yourself a favor...use book keeping software. Doesn't really matter which...it could be something as simple as an Excel spreadsheet (or even a Google Doc spreadsheet which is free). Keep a running tab of your account balance after every transaction that you do...that way you always know your account balance before the bank even fascilitates the transaction and you will never overdraw. Compare your spreadsheet with your online account balance at the end of every business day to match up transactions (always good to look out for fraud on your account just in case). Do the above steps and your golden...the only thing holding you back from success is a little book work.

This is where Bitcoin's true value lies...it *is* a commodity (finite resource with intrinsic value to the holder) but it has the utility of a currency (freely tradeable, divisible, easily transacted). This is the revolutionary aspect of Bitcoin, it's a new world unit resurrecting an old world mercantile system. We used to trade items of value based on the weight of gold...now we're beginning to trade items of value based on a digital commodity, and this is not a bad thing. It means that we'll finally be able to get rid of the middle institution that has taken over the transaction process, primarily banks.

Depends on how you look at it...a traditional economist's perspective would say that the worldwide economy is driven by nation-states and their various political/trade interactions.

So I've read through the relevant sections of the UCC, and I see where you're coming from. You could be right, I'm not a law expert...but in practice I know that banks see a very real distinction between personal checks, business checks, treasury checks, and cashier's checks. They're all checks but of varying degrees of trustworthiness. Even Wal-Mart won't cash personal checks, and the reason why they can cash payroll checks is because most payroll checks are verifiable through ADP or Paychex or some sort of payroll check system.  
  
Sorry, if I came across badly on my first comment...I didn't mean to shoot you down. I would be excited to be a part of an openly/publicly held banking system (which is why I enjoy being part of the Bitcoin community). But I have reservations about negotiating personal checks, since there's no real way to know how secure the promise to pay really is until it's presented to the signer's bank. If there is absolutely nothing to secure that check, and if the bank chooses to pay that check, than the bank will take a loss on that check. Now turn that around and say, if you and I were operating our publicly held bank and honored every payment whether secure or not...we'd take a lot of loss on potentiall fraudulent transactions.  
  
But then again, your scenario was based on both holders having the same bank...in which case I personally wouldn't have a problem with your scenario...but like I said, I'm no expert on the law I just have experience with how banks currently work. Obviously, the object of our publicly held bank is to NOT have a bank that uses current rules for banking so I may not be the best guy to bounce ideas off of. lol

This would be the huge breakthrough for the masses, and would definitely cause a surge of adoption by those interested in Bitcoin but afraid that it might be insecure.

....budgets don't have much to do with regulations, really. Regulations are passed in an attempt to curb inherent greed in free market mentality, but the problem is that regulations are passed after the damage is already done and therefore regulation will always play a catch up game to corporate greed. Not to mention that corporations are constantly lobbying to keep regulation minimal at best, and you have a recipe for disaster as plainly seen in our current state of economy. But, someone's got to do something at some point...regulations have a purpose, even if they are not always seen as beneficial or needed

I think my "aha" moment just happened the other day...for the few weeks that I decided to jump in and see what Bitcoin was all about, I kept arguing all over that Bitcoin was a commodity (to be fair, it has some of the same properties of a normal commodity...and I still feel that it somewhat of a commodity, but not on the traditional sense). But just the other day, I was browsing Gyft to get a glimpse of some things I could purchase using my small amount of bitcoin...I halfway went through the process, just to see how the transaction would go and then cleared my "Send" tab before I sent the transaction through. Then I sat back in my chair...and realized how amazingly useful the bitcoin payment system really is! Easier than Paypal, no need to worry about credit card information being saved on the receiving server, instant person-to-person transactions...that's when I realized this really *is* a revolutionary product that can't be dismissed by mere government regulation once the world understands how amazing this product really is!  
  
I'm still new to bitcoin...haven't fully grasped the whole potential yet...but I'm a believer now. Once more online merchants start adopting bitcoin (please Newegg!), I know I can't ever go back to the usual payment systems now...and I couldn't be happier about that.  
  
Edit: As an aside, I'd like to apologize to the couple of redditors that I kept arguing with about how bitcoin is strictly a commodity. Forgive a newbie his ignorance...I've since changed my mind...for now, I still feel the *coin* is a commodity but with a payment system attachment that moves the coin like a currency, which is pretty nifty and useful.

The reason that checks are returned NSF is that checks are drafts, not notes. Drafts are negotiable instruments that orders the bank to make a payment to the payee for a certain amount, and when the funds are not available in the account on the check than the bank is unable to fascilitate the transaction requested. The reason that the bank isn't able to hold the check against the CD is because the bank can only fascilitate the transaction from the account printed on the check, since that is the instrument with the owners signature (unless there is an agreement to pull funds immediately from a linked account as an overdraft protection contract). Some banks are able to give you a line of credit using the CD as collateral, in which case the bank would be able to draw on the line of credit to fascilitate the transaction (this is basically the same idea that you presented, only the charges on the line of credit would accrue interest if the balance is unpaid for a length of time). The reason why the bank must immediately draw funds from an account is because they are required by federal law to fascilitate funds in a timely manner (availability of funds regulations), and so if funds are going out than the item must be paid immediately rather than delayed.  
  
Also, checks (even endorsed checks) are not considered actual money but rather an order from the signer to for the bank to fascilitate a transfer of funds. It's basically an elaborate IOU (checks have an interesting history, it's really the original credit system evolved over time to become what they are now...they used to require 4 different parties to fascilitate transactions and now banks have assumed 2 of the 4 roles to fascilitate transactions between 2 individuals).  
  
Cashier's checks, on the other hand, are drafts of a different sense. Banks must fascilitate up to 5,000 dollars of a cashier's check transaction by the following business day, but are allowed by federal law to hold the rest of the funds for up to...7 business days I think (can't remember off the top of my head).  
  
In either case, checks are drafts and not notes. Drafts are not actual money, but orders to fascilitate payments. Notes can be considered actual monetary instruments.
