Right, but the physical employees (working at the warehouse) would be a different company that is contracted to the parent HQ located offshore.
The money part (revenue from paying customers) would be located offshore... and 100% in bitcoin, so effectively hidden from any countries tax rules.

Keep in mind that coinbase has access to your bitcoins, since they are in possession of your private key(s).
If you're comfortable with that knowledge... then ok.
(ie: What if coinbase gets hacked, or they go bankrupt, or .... somehow one of their disgruntled employee's steals your private key?)
Imho, if you aren't going to be *using* your bitcoins, then you should store them offline and only YOU should know and have access to your private key(s).
I keep only a little bit in my coinbase.com account.  Just like I only keep a little bit in my paypal account, etc...  I don't trust any 3rd party with my money, when there are such easy options to keep it safer elsewhere.

I'm not sure what difference it makes to have all your bitcoins in one address or many addresses.  Unless you're storing each address on a completely different computer... then what's the point?  (ie: You said you have all the addresses in a single ascii file, so if that file is hacked, then you're screwed and having 1000 different addresses with .0001 BTC in each will not make a difference.)
I think it is better to implement very good security and use only offline signing on a computer that is NEVER connected to the internet.  Then when you want to spend something, you create the transaction, sign if OFFLINE, and then send it using a connected machine.  It's easy to do with Electrum wallet.  With this setup, it is just confusing and not any additional security to have multiple addresses with coins in each.
TL/DR; Unless you're also storing each address on a different computer and never put your private keys stored in a single consolidated location, you aren't actually improving your security.

Just keep in mind that imported private keys in Electrum are *not* recoverable with your seed passphrase.  Only private keys that are generated by Electrum using your seed passphrase are recoverable.  :)

The fingerprint/iris/whatever would be *in addition* to the seed.  Not an alternative to a seed.  
So someone would need your seed AND your fingerprint/irus/whatever to get access to your keys.

Just to add a little more info...
When you make a transaction (sending bitcoins), that transaction needs to be "confirmed" by the miners.  The miners are more likely to do that work quickly if they are paid a little something.  They are paid by the transaction fee.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:17:46
Nope.  You can't get a transaction reversed.
If you sent to the wrong address, then you have lost the coins.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:39:57
There is a "transaction fee" that can be added to any bitcoin transaction.  Normally that fee is very small, and you can even specify zero as the transaction fee.
The fee is paid to the "miners" who add your transaction into the blockchain and verify it, etc...    This action (verify your transaction as legitimate) will happen faster if you pay a high transaction fee, and slower (or not at all) if you pay lower or no transaction fee.
Some online wallet sites (like coinbase, etc..) will pay the transaction fee themselves in some cases.  Some of them won't allow you to specify/change the fee.
What I suggest is to use a wallet that lets you specify your own transaction fees.  (Like electrum wallet.)

It's impossible to know who "owns" an address unless the owner purposely and publicly associates themselves with that address.  
That's one of the nice things about bitcoin.  :)

Yes, Sealand. However that would not work because of the problem of electricity and internet connectivity.
It would need to be a "legit" offshore location that has a reliable infrastructure.

Yesterday is always the best time to start something profitable today.
Don't dwell on the past.  We all missed the domain name market, too.  I should have registered pizza.com when I had the chance.

This isn't worth the time for $5.  Remember that you're talking about statistics when you say that a brainwallet is "less secure" than something else.
A brainwallet that is generated with "20 characters or less" is still very very secure.  Is it as secure as one generated using "21 characters or more"? No.  But it might be the difference between 900 years of computing power versus 500 years of computing power needed to crack it.
The point is that nobody is going to take your offer unless the prize is worth the time and effort.
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:42:49
Yes, exactly.  So you would require *both* to be able to rebuild your keys.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:24:58
Your "wallet address" has two parts:
1. The public key.  This is the number you can give to anyone so they can send you money.  In your example, it is "1MQYhZ1wD62LKcAa1zGxGy96JGWeko7YVW".  If someone sends bitcoin to this key.... then.... (see next part)
2. The private key.  This is the IMPORTANT part.  Whomever has access to the private key associated with a public key has 100% control over the coins associated with that key.  So in our example... if someone sends you a bitcoin to the public address you have... then only YOU will be able to access (spend) that bitcoin since only YOU have that private key.
It is confusing to you, because you are using coinbase for your wallet, and they do not let you see the private keys that are associated with your public keys.  (So effectively, someone at coinbase could "steal" your bitcoins, since they know what is your private key.)
Coinbase hides the private keys from you because it makes it easier for you to use their system.  You don't have to worry about storing your private keys, etc... they just automatically do it all for you. But in reality... they are doing it for you.
This is a big reason why most people recommend that you do not store a lot of bitcoin with an "online wallet".  it is because your private keys are stored on a server somewhere, and someone besides you has access to that server.   It is definitely easier to use an online wallet, though, since you don't have to manage your private keys.
I hope that helps?

Isn't selling and buying in bitcoin (without going to/from fiat currency) the whole point of bitcoin?  
It's an alternative (secure and anonymous) currency, no?
Personally, I don't think bitcoin is going to be popular in the mainstream *until* it is possible to do day-to-day purchases using exclusively bitcoin.  (ie: Bitcoin will really take off when you can pull out your phone and pay for your gas using bitcoin.)

Yes, what could go wrong with fraud?
(Hint:  Suddenly being locked out of your account and unable to access whatever money you have in it.)
Honestly, you're best bet is to do it legitimately.  Ask your parents to transfer utilities into your name.  Signup for internet at your house (even if you already have it) for one month.  Don't wait for the bill to arrive.. go get them to print it for you and pay in advance.  Ditto for cellphone. Go to sprint/Verizon or whatever and signup for their cheapest plan that you can cancel in a month.  You just want the bill, right?  Then ask them to print it out right now, pay it, and you're done.

Well, currently to live you must transfer BTC into whatever fiat currency is used for where you live.  So when your bank account suddenly receives $10 deposit... your government has access to that amount and they will declare it as revenue/income and you must pay tax on it.  (Unless you can prove otherwise.)
In reality this doesn't happen much... but it could (if you're audited).
If you keep all your BTC as BTC then there's literally no way your government will know what you have.  (Unless they can somehow associate your BTC addresses to you.)
If you spend in BTC and never transfer to your local currency, then your government won't know about it.  That is, until they see that somehow you're able to buy a house, car, electricity, and food... with no income.  Then they will simply "assess" you with a tax amount and penalty for not declaring your income... and you must prove them wrong.  (Good luck.)
There's no way to avoid the tax man unless you don't exist.
