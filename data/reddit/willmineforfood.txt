Agreed! Once I got my account activated and funded I was asked if I wanted to now "verify" my account which will allow me to perform larger deposit and withdrawl transactions than the base $500 cap. I am going to do this as well in case I am feeling lucky... Just for the record I am already down about 8% on my first purchase ha ha... but I am in it for the long haul so hopefully it goes crazy this week.

Thanks KevinPope I should have mentioned that I am in the states too... however if you go to the BitInstant site ( this is the Cash Deposit process:
	
Step 1
You select your country and deposit location, then fill in your info and follow the instructions.
If you want your funds to be credited at your exchange account (Mt.Gox, Crypto X Change, etc) then select that exchange as the "Pay to" destination. Otherwise, select "Bitcoin to email" and Bitcoins will be bought at the market rate automatically and sent directly to your email address after your deposit.
	
Step 2
You will be given a "deposit slip" with info on it. Print this out, and take it to the location.
Take your deposit slip and go to the cash deposit location you selected. Follow the deposit instructions on the slip; they will tell you what to do (and who to speak with) at the deposit location (Walmart, bank branch, 7-Eleven, etc)
	
Step 3
After you've deposited your cash, you are done.
Within 30-60 minutes, you will be notified via email that your transfer was successful, and the funds will appear in your exchange account (or bitcoins will arrive in your email if you selected "Bitcoin to Email" in the first step).
Go try it! You can have Bitcoin 30 minutes from now. (this is what's on their site, not my overly enthusiastic tone)

Yeah some of the other methods wanted me to mail a money order in, preferably from the post office, or they couldnt guarantee the money order would work. It would take 7 - 10 days before it would even be looked at then an additional 3 days to process... what a nightmare
