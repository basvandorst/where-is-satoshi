And how does the link you provided support your arugument?

Yup. No faces behind the words you read. We could all just be bots.

you guys wanted mainstream right? cos this is what mainstream will look like. I hope people aren't expecting the average joe to know about zero knowledge proofs and schnorr signatures. Most people don't even know how the internet works. If you want a discussion head over to bitcoin talk.

segwit is technically a blocksize increase. Tho I do agree, even with lightning + segwit. Bitcoin will still need a blocksize increase.

i've done all my panic buys. now i'm just gonna set up some recurring buys and try to forget about this for a while.

i feel like coinbase does this intentionally. same thing happened at 13k

I started on antonop videos, i'm waiting for that bitcoin to become a reality.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:09:34
once you watch a antonop video you will probably never sell any btc again

i think it might be Bcash vs blockstream

1% of all bitcoin has been through this address (	1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s) which is linked, if you click far enough, to whoever gave andreas all that btc.
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:59:14
this is what stopped me from buying bitcoin all those years ago. "1 BTC is $230.67! No way, I can't afford that!"
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:23:14
i think it spun out of control. there was a price increase and a lot of hype due to s2x, then that cause media attention. then as it got higher more media attention. bearing in mind this was all before the supposed fork. and then it just spiralled into this. and i guess if you have a lot of bitcoin and happen to be influential your gonna want the price to go up. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:59:47
10 minutes per block. same as btc. i don't understand how bch is any better than btc. the only reason you can get away with 1cent fees is because all of the blocks aren't even full. but you can't just keep increasing the blocksize forever. I dont see myself in future using bch to buy a coffee and then having to wait 1-10 minutes for a single confirmation when lightning could do it in a couple of seconds. (this could all be wrong if ive misunderstood the fundamentals of bitcoin, i only started learning about crypto two weeks ago.)

10k incoming
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:04:14
be happy you got in when you did. Cos if the price goes up alot you'll be glad you made that initial investment. And if the price goes down alot to the price it was a year ago, well then you get a second chance to buy low again.

all those downvotes but no reply explaining why he/she is wrong? spooky

A person who truly understands the value of bitcoin would never liquidate all their btc holdings and jump back into a scam known as fiat.

bitcoin to $100,000. current wont drop past $7k
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:50:07
if bitcoin is ever worth $1mill, how much will $1mill be worth?
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:03:11
-There are 38 billion xrp in circulation with a 9 billion market cap. 
-There are 16 million BTC in circulation with a 130 billion market cap
If the amount of btc suddenly doubled, the price per btc would be cut in half. 
See 1 xrp as being a single grain of rice, not much value by itself. But in large amounts it can be useful.

Anytime the words "Africa" and "Bitcoin" get mentioned in the same sentence on reddit it's like people get mad for some reason . I see people saying things like "Africans are too poor to buy bitcoin..." or "They have no internet". lol

market cap means nothing.

yup that's what I literally realised yesterday. Bitmain had the biggest ico of 2017 when they released the bch token.

@_date: 2018-03-29 22:17:56
America is just too big for them. To the south you got Mexicans, who they don't like. To the North you got Canadians who they just about tolerate. Living in Europe, if you travel 500 miles in one direction you'll either end up in the ocean or in a different country with people that speak another language. If you travel 500 miles in one direction in America, you'll just end up around more dumb Americans. They're just boxed in. SAD.

People trying to limit Bitcoin to only be peer to peer digital cash don't really understand what Bitcoin is.

you haven't been paying attention then. its people like you who will get hurt the most. everything will crash and you'll be wondering wtf happened. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 02:04:34
yup over at r/btc  bitmain shills are speaking against Monero saying the hard fork is the result of greedy Monero miners. How ironic.
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:42:44
1 Btc will always equal 1 Btc my friend. If that ends up not being the case and 1 satoshi = 1btc, then the new thing that you would be using would not be Bitcoin, just another fork.

tether fud was heavy in feb. Trust I'm paying close attention to tether but there wasn't much mention of it during this dip, so I thought it was a continuation of the correction. If there was tether fud we would of dipped to 4k. I'm expecting the dip to just be caused by fear though, with nothing being revealed in the end. On the other hand, if serious fraud gets exposed then expect a multi year bear market.

- bitcoin is bought -&gt; price goes up
- bitcoin is sold -&gt; price goes down
@_date: 2018-04-15 02:18:40
yh i was gonna correct myself afterwards but I wanted to make it as simple as possible. What I should have said is: If more Bitcoin is bought then sold, the price will go up, and vice versa.
@_date: 2018-04-14 00:53:10
I wanted to buy some bitcoin when it was ~$1000, but I was too lazy and forgot about it. When I remembered it was $6k. Then I bought. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 02:32:01
I remember in december, I saw a guy on twitter say why would anyone buy litecoin because it was losing sats. Two days later it reached a new all time high.
@_date: 2018-04-14 01:00:57
I guess you have to be intelligent to become a crypto dev developer if that's what you mean. Luck involves picking a high to sell or a bottom to buy. But that is not bitcoin, that's just trading. 
Bitcoin is not goverened by luck, but by math.
