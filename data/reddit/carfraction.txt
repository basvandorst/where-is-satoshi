What people don't understand is nobody has to sell for the price to return to zero.  Your money isn't in bitcoin, it's in the pocket of the person that sold it to you. I think even the dumber big players are going to see what's happening and they will be hitting those exits all at the same time.  "Be sure and catch the show, you paid for a front row seat"

Dollars can easily be invested to offset the continues erosion of inflation. An average annual return of 3.2% over the last 100 years would have protected your purchasing power. If you'd have invested dollars in a basket of stocks as represented by the S&amp;P 500, your purchasing power in 100 years would have increased by 2000%. If you'd instead have bought gold your net purchasing power over that 100 years would have increased by 25%. bitcoins at best can be expected to match gold but it's just as possible that bitcoin will be forgotten in the pile of histories once valuable collectible assets.

You should also have the chart of the Dow where $1 becomes $13,000 ($650 adjusted for inflation).
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:15:51
Inflation is a tax on all wealth. it hurt's the wealthy the least since they typically consume a smaller percent of their wealth to live on. A million invested in the stock market 100 years ago would have grown to 13 billion, After you pay capitol gains and adjust for inflation you still have increased the spending power by 500 times. If you think you are outsmarting the investors that lent you your mortgage, you better get out of gambling on crypto.

"  Because something like Bitcoin has never existed before ..." ahhh yes, it's always different this time. It HAS to appear different for a reason, no mass delusion can be pulled off twice because peoples can already recognise it. When  I would post to the message boards in november and december of 1999 how the stock market  was in a obvious and classic bubble, i'd get the same argument that it's different because "we all have the internet to help us value stocks which increases out wisdom and makes it impossible for us to be fooled like those morons of yesteryear". What's most ironic is I foretold of the coming bubble in February of 1995 and even predicted the DOW should reach 12,000 before the bubble would burst (dow was at 5000 and everyone was at that price crying about how overpriced stocks were, look at a chart). I'd explain how I was able to beat the masses but given my chilly reception to anything that counters these mass delusions, i already know  the futility. If I'd told you how accurately I've called every single turn in the markets since 1995, you'd say bullshit and honestly, I'm confused and a little freaked out at just how accurately and easy they were to see and everyone else is blind. No way it's just luck because I've gotten both price and timing to close to perfect to be coincidental.
Having said all that, I'm not convinced that bitcoin will become worthless but I do expect to see it at least selloff to support at 1200 before reassessing it (for history, bitcoin is at 7100 while I write this).
Another very important thing i've learned about the public and even the friends that I've explain speculation, too, nobody cares! People claim to want to make money in the market but this is totally wrong. What they want is casino action from home. They want the emotional thrills of risk, and they don't care if that thrill is from being right or being wrong, just as long as they can play and something produces adrenaline. If you don't understand this, answer why millionaires and billionaires gamble to bankruptcy when all their needs are already met.
I've even posted perfect calls in both directions here on reddit but all I've ever gotten was hate, not once has anyone expressed the least bit of curiosity. What they will seek out are the opinions of "experts" even if that expert has been wrong 10 times in a row, but that agree with their own opinion. Humans just aren't that smart or as I like to remind people, we are all running on brains designed 10's of thousands of years ago and some from 50,000 years ago.
@_date: 2019-12-19 14:19:58
The idea is push prices up rapidly so you don't have to spend as much capitol, then you slowly feed the bitcoins back to the market so it doesn't drop as fast as when you pushed them up. Just look at the chart points as well. Bitcoin made a base at 6560 and just sat their, big player pushes it down below that base, hits the stops, then pushes it in the opposite direction, lets it sit their at what appears to be a top, waits for players to place buy stops just above that number, then pushes price higher and dump onto those stops. (see volume spike above 7240. This market is totally rigged and I'll wager 90% of bitcoin holders you ask, are all sitting on losses. RIGGED GAME.

As someone that used to watch CNBC decades ago, this is every single "expert" on every single asset. The only thing they know is how to market themselves. The rare and brilliant usually know better. Market pundits are like infomercial exercise gear and weight loss concepts, selling miracles to the lazy. What's most startling is how quickly the same simpletons jump on the newer idea even though the last one was wasted money.

Do you recognise your mistake? My son who's only 23 wanted to "invest" about the same time you did. My advice to him was; "If you feel like your missing out and want to buy, you are most likely at a market top ". Wise traders buy when others sell in fear, and sell when others are giddy with greed. Bitcoin, unlike stocks and bonds has an unknowable value. The only thread of hope is $4000 was my target for the selloff and should provide some kind of decent bounce. If this price does not hold, we are probably seeing the end. If it's the end, it will still take many years to become worthless.
Here's my advice (with of course negative karma) from 9 months ago on this sub; " Anyone that thinks they know what bitcoin is worth, shouldn't be speculating in bit coin."

You need a new lawyer! I understand kids getting caught up in a bubble but he should be much wiser.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:34:22
Stuff and nonsense. Whether a currency/asset is inflationary or deflationary is just a matter of relative perspective. For example a bond buyer believes the bond they are buying including the interest it's paying, is a deflationary asset, while the bond seller believes the opposite relative to what they are using the proceeds for. Thinking crypto is deflationary depends on what other asset you measure it against. Gold for example has increased by 4000% as measured against the dollar over the last 50 years. Gold has lost 99.99% of it's value as measured against bitcoin over the last 9 years. Therefore gold is both inflationary and deflationary as measure against those competing stores of wealth.

You been brainwashed by people with
more paranoia than knowledge. Banks don’t create money PERIOD! They currently lend out about 90% of what they receive from depositors. It’s called fractional reserve (they can only lend out 9/10 ‘s of deposits). When you lend money to someone you can lend 100% of your money on hand if you so wish and keep nothing in reserve I.e. nothing in reserve lending. You really need to get a more balanced source of information.

Even when interest rates were paying 5%, the reality was you were getting a negative return on your money. Take 5% interest, subtract 3.8% lost to inflation and pay 1.6% of taxes on your “profit” of 5%. Negative rates arn’t negative if you are experiencing even greater levels of deflation of the 
 underlying currency.  .

If one the other hand I buy XYZ at an amount higher than $1000 in hopes of finding someone even more clueless to pay ever more, I'm working the "greater fool theory" which isn't investing at all and will fail.

Commodities, like bitcoin is not an investment. 100% of the speculators believe they have a better understanding of the underling asset than the current market price. Yet we know that half of them have to be wrong. Now you add in all the expenses of the trade i.e. your time, commissions, fraud and less than 50% of the speculators can hope for a better than break even outcome. When the numbers indicate a less than 50% of breaking even, you are gambling, not investing.

You can say the same of lottery winners but that doesn't make lottery tickets an investment. At least with lottery tickets I can tell you there theoretical value and if they are a good buy. For example, a daily 3 pays $500 for a ticket price of $1. Since you would have to buy all 1000 number combinations to guarantee a win of $500, a  $1 ticket is really only worth 50 cents.  If you can buy lottery tickets below 50 cents, they have investment potential . Bitcoins can't be valued so they can't be an investment. What powers bitcoin fever is the greater fool theory.  [
