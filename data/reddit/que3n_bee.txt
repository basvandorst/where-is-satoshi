Perfect thread for me! Step by step guide about paper wallet so when i have my bitcoin I'll know how to make one (sorry for the very noob question but im technically challenged lol)

I have like 3$ worth of bitcoin from tips,and i'd like to experiment on them so i know what to do when i finally have a sizeable amount of bitcoin. Any help about paper wallet encryption and brainwallet will be very much appreciated :)

Oh ok,im not really in a position to take that kind of risk i guess. I trust in bitcoin though and i believe bitcoin is the future.

@_date: 2014-05-26 16:41:45
I finally jumped in :) I'm positive about this weekly "investment".

I heard a local drug dealer is accepting payments by bitcoin. I'm heading there :D :p
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:26:32
I know most are, but i heard stories about people trading and riding pump and dump to make profit,so are you suggesting it's a lot of risk?
@_date: 2014-07-05 16:39:26
you must be over 60 to not distinguish a joke

Good Guy Mike Garber. You're the only one supporting him,he does post interesting stuffs.
@_date: 2014-05-27 15:14:24
Hmm thanks a lot. So i'll go with BIP38 then :)
@_date: 2014-05-26 15:52:03
I'll keep that in mind,thanks.

That's some interesting infos,and if you deduct all the bitcoins "gone" from Mt Gox etc there's only less bitcoins for everyone to share right? So bitcoin has no way but up?
@_date: 2014-05-26 15:56:22
This interest me for some reason.
@_date: 2014-05-26 16:39:44
Thanks for the tip! I already read and watch a step by step guide on how to make a paper wallet,already downloaded bitcoin full wallet but switched to Electrum as someone suggested.
