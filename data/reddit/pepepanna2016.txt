Look at the price of gold since futures, never hit it's all time high since. This is a rigged game, but hodlers will be rewarded when their fiat takes a big shit, and it will eventually.

Lot of good news lately but the price action hasn't correlated. 
Funny how a Facebook Post about possible ICO regulation on a couple exchanges in SoKor can drive the price down.
