Thanks god the corner of my eyes always checks the clipboard made his job when it comes to BTC addresses or right now my funds would be transferred to someone's 1B89R9MkA6NwVof4RoC4VpcZH675teu1LR address instead of LB investors. Anyways: 1.- LB accounts hacked some days ago 2.- Received email informing me that my account was locked for security reasons and that i had to reset my LB password. 3.- I didnt have to reset my password as i logged in smoothly with my old password today 4.- an MITM attack fired against my LB account today 5.- Right now Microsoft informs me that unusual activity has been performed on my account (which is the same i used for LB) and they providing me the following details Dettagli accesso: Paese/area geografica: Russia Indirizzo IP: 83.237.32.120 Data: 20/02/2016 18:42 (CET)

MITM attack on Loanbase. 20 february 2016 14:34 UTC +2
Needed to fund my account to pay but Man in the Middle attack made me copy/paste someone else BTC address. Notice the screwed https on top left address bar. Tried both copy to clipboard button and ctrl+c/ctrl+v
Guys...that website is screwed up! Afaik that kind of attack can be performed only from "inside" loanbase servers/code.
Hopefully they wil get better.

In italy it is not common to see english ads, unless very famous brands like coca cola, Yves The Saint Lauren etc enforce the company style keeping their original language too. In this case, consider "ilsole24ore" has an audience between large corporations and high financial managers which commonly use english for their daily activity. Words like "risk management" are common usage and well known to medium italian readers too, because of lack italian alternatives that would describe the "risk management" concept in just 2 words. FOr example the word "rischio" has a lot of meanings but if you say "risk management" any italian with medium culture would understand they talking about financial fraud risk.
