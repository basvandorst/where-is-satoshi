It will be much harder to crack a mathematically driven/coded open source decentralized exchange.

I just checked it out, they do have a maximum limit of 1 btc per trade, if they raise their limits or we create an open source decentralized exchange capable of handing large volume will help boost people confidence.

That is why we need a strong decentralized platform where many developers should actively participate, so that this does not happen, and keep hackathons to test the security of the system. Trusting in centralized system always leads to disaster, thats what we learned from governments, its high time we develop/switch to decentralized exchanges.

I am also looking for the same answer, a decentralized currency without a proper decentralized exchange is disastrous.

it is good, it will not attract big traders if that is the case and for larger mainstream use. They need to increase per trade size. We should look into strengthening our system and never be scared of a hacker, a hacker can only steal if we are not strong enough, about time we strengthen our forts.

+1 decentralized exchanges are the future, it is about time we learn from our mistake and stop throwing our hands into fire.
