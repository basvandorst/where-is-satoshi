According to libertarians, anything done by the executive or judicial branches is unconstitutional.  Even when they are exercising powers explicitly given to them by the constitution that have been reviewed and confirmed by the supreme court.  
If the president took a shit without congressional approval you guys would be saying that he was a constitution-raping tyrant socialist nazi.

What is this bill you guys keep talking about?  There is no bill.

Sure if you made fast lanes *without* trying to extort money from web sites and services, but in that case, why make fast lanes at all?  
If you *are* trying to get money from other companies, there's going to be a paper trail.  (Not that it matters since as soon as you asked Netflix to pay for a fast lane, they'd immediately report you.)


Yeah, sorry, but I'll pay a penny in tax to avoid a dollar in corporate monopoly rape.  I don't give corporations a free pass for extorting money from me while decrying the government for asking for taxes to enforce common sense regulation.  It doesn't make any practical sense.


Good luck attempting to argue to congress why you need extra money to *not* do something that requires additional effort.


Again, how are ISPs going to do this without their victims (Netflix, google, etc.) complacency?  And why the hell would any company comply with demands that the ISPs aren't even legally allowed to request of them?

This is why no one takes you guys seriously.

Right.  No need.  The broadband market will totally regulate itself, just like it has been.  /s

You're really accusing me of making personal attacks against the guy who said:


Pull your head out of your ass.
The reason why I initially didn't entertain his reasoning is that any claim that the FCC's decision was "not constitutional" is almost to silly to warrant a response.  FCC classification is up to FCC and under the executive branch.  It always has been.  Did I vote directly for the FCC chairmen?  No.  But I was able to vote for a president who is in charge of all things falling under the executive. 
Is this "OMG powergrab dictatorship!!!111"  No.  Our constitution that you guys all claim to understand so well and hold in such regard makes provisions for handling this.  Congress can pass a law overriding the decision and preventing the FCC from making that call in the future.  And that's exactly what republicans in congress are preparing right now (none of them are attempting to say that the FCC or executive violated the constitution because that is pretty clearly a ridiculous argument to anyone with even a high school education in civics.)
