You would also need someone who wants to buy that colored coin created by random bank. That's not Bitcoin liquidity. Bitcoin liquidity is: Whale puts his wealth in Bitcoin for storage or for sending it to the other side of the world, and the price barely moves.
And like someone else explained to you: buying Bitcoin *is* investing in infrastructure (the mining industry). I don't know what you want when you say "infrastructure". More merchants? More exchanges? To what end? The price is lagging way behind in comparison.

I have actually asked tons of questions and they didn't answer them. They just keep repeating "open source!", "reflash the firmware!", "they are good guys!". My main questions were actually these: How do you verify the hardware? The answer is you can't. You can never be 100% certain it's not rigged. And how do you know they aren't sending rigged hardware to a few, random customers? You can't know either, because *no one* bothers to verify their shiny Trezor. In fact there aren't even enough people who know how to do this. And even if some did, chances are their Trezors will be the ones that are fine.
Coins will be stolen this way. Mark my words.

They have also spent a big part of that money in a marketing company, which is the same that helped other shitcoins (and it worked to some degree, at least for the pump). They even managed to buy a prize to make Ethereum look like a disruptive technology (that doesn't even exist). The whole thing is a circus.

I'm certain. My notebook for cold storage was created before Bitcoin, and I created the private keys using dice and software I wrote myself.

Do you expect upvotes for being wrong? You are asking very basic questions, and then dismissing the answers like you know everything.
If supply goes down in exchanges, the price goes up. Simple as that. Coins in cold storage don't matter until they are spent. The market doesn't even know if those coins are lost.

All they do at r/Litecoin is cry and beg u/coblee to push their agenda in Coinbase, and he keeps answering that Coinbase has not even hinted to having plans on that. And to say that "it has more development than other alts" means exactly nothing. In fact it's simply a lie, because coins that are not clones of Bitcoin (eg: Monero) have way more development than Litecoin.


What a joke. Most of that market cap is just bag holders like you who will never sell, so of course the price can't go lower than it is now. Analyze its liquidity, and then we can talk.


That means nothing either. And by the way, Ripple is waaay larger than Litecoin. But of course you will choose some arbitrary reasons for why it "doesn't count" and litecoin is still  Dogetards do the same: "Centralized, doesn't count! PoS, doesn't count! Premined!

Brigading is when someone posts a link, and many people go there just to rig the voting. But I think it's also when one person goes and tries to downvote everything one person says, using his user history.

Says the Trezor developer.


I can validate open source code, in fact I could even write it myself. But I can't validate hardware, let alone do it without breaking it. With Trezor we have to trust you.

I think not even copycoiners believe Coinbase could add Litebitcoin or Dogeshit, they only say it as a lame attempt to pump their dying clones.

Damn, you bought a VIP seat for the moon rocket.
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:30:54
Zero. Why would I trust some private company? I have no way to know they aren't using a rigged RNG or some other crypto trickery in say 1 of every 10 or 100 Trezors.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:57:50
You are dumb.
@_date: 2015-01-25 17:55:24
Actually yes, what Bitcoin needs now is a higher price and liquidity so that it can store more wealth, become more stable, less risky, and attract bigger players.
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:30:24
@_date: 2015-01-26 09:05:11
Yeah, that's why when people stopped spending their gold it died. /s
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:26:10
Then don't use Bitcoin. Unlike fiat, it's completely voluntary.
@_date: 2015-02-08 11:52:52
Someone posted an explanation for this, I don't remember the name of the effect (it was on wikipedia), but it was something about people don't liking to see people from their own group/class becoming rich (but they are fine with seeing people from other groups becoming rich or going from rich to super rich).
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:06:55


But we ended up using that as an argument against the idiots who say Bitcoin is good for terrorism.

No, in fact last year he said it would take about 7 years to reach every corner of the world. His logic was that adoption would be 3 times faster than the time it took to the internet because most of the infrastructure needed is already there.

and is where many of the trolls were born. They simply can't accept that others have had great success in an investment they dismissed. So now they live a life of hate and sorrows, spreading FUD and attacking anyone who is involved with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:00:55
If a coin succeeds it will succeed. Got it.
@_date: 2015-02-07 03:57:45
So it's not secure lololol
They'll eventually figure out that all roads lead to Bitcoin.

99.9% of all stores don't accept most currencies (try going to your local grocery store and pay with yuan), and Bitcoin is already accepted in more places than half the fiat currencies.

Dark Wallet is not "beign designed by some alternative currency folks", it's for Bitcoin!

Getting tired of this story, yawn. Wake me up when they realize the blockchain is useless if the coin doesn't have value.
@_date: 2015-02-08 10:38:11
Go ahead.

But that's the one thing that makes sense. Unless you are a r/buttcoin enthusiast of course.

@_date: 2015-02-08 18:58:12
Yes, and? That's the opposite of what you say in the OP.
There is no such thing as prices tied to things, just supply and demand. If there is more demand for something (be it cows, USD, or sex), its price in all currencies goes up. If there is less demand (or more supply), its price goes down.
So what happens if nobody wants USD anymore? That's less demand, so the price of USD goes down in all other currencies including Bitcoin (and prices of things in USD go up, but remain the same in other currencies). So the price of Bitcoin in USD goes up. That doesn't make Bitcoin more valuable, just the USD less valuable.

Except Dogecoin is redundant while Bitcoin is a revolution, and 1000 bits is not a fraction of a cent.

We were talking about what Organic_Peach said: "deflationary economy". No ambiguity here. Besides it's the most common meaning for "deflation". People talking in terms of "monetary inflation" are usually just trolls trying to confuse people into believing Bitcoin is inflationary.

Copying is not stealing. Let me explain this with a song:

Are you sure? They will be getting the same value as before, because the currency is now worth more. And last time I checked, merchants loved to use price reductions to attract more customers. Everyone wins (except the people in power who wants to steal from the savers by printing more money).

So, do you now know what deflation is?

Thanks! The downvoters are probably altcoin shills and trolls. Trolls are loving this news.

He wasn't talking about the price, so what's your point? Oh, you didn't read the article? Ok then.
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:56:58
Sorry but that's just a stupid generalization. In my experience, most people want to know why it isn't a scam. Explaining how to send/receive bitcoins won't clear that up.
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:46:24
But you trolls said Bitcoin was dead last year. And the year before that, and the year before that, and the year before that...

Blockchain.info was showing it as a double-spend, but after 20 or 30 confirmations it just stopped for no reason.
@_date: 2013-09-11 04:12:37
Chill out guys, I understand inputs, I have hand-crafted valid transactions in the past. But this stupid website showed a wrong warning and I got confused by (probably) an auto-refreshing page or something, plus two unfortunate identical address:amount in a very short time frame.
@_date: 2013-09-11 04:06:17
Is it possible that Blockchain.info was marking as double-spend the transaction that is now the accepted one, and as valid the one that (I guess) just got removed and I confused with an almost identical one?
@_date: 2013-09-11 04:23:12
Yeah, that's the warning.
@_date: 2013-09-11 04:09:08
But if the protocol is clear, how come Blockchain.info was marking [this]( one as double-spend? It showed a warning telling me to be careful with transactions relayed by that node.
