You obviously don’t use crypto for daily or weekly transactions at all.  Try your bitcoin out...you’ll notice it’s difficult to use.  So difficult that you’ll understand that is why companies and people are dropping it quickly.  It doesn’t work.  
Do you honestly think lightning network in 18 months will save you? It will make the crypto barrier to usage/entry even larger for people.  It will be so complicated.  It’s easier to just use a credit card.  Nobody will adopt that. 
Also - if bitcoin is a store of value then it shouldn’t matter if the lightning network fixes anything.  But you probably haven’t realized that either.  Good luck defending something you are holding a bag on.

Why warn them about Bitcoin Cash? Why is it scary to you? Bitcoin Cash is bitcoin.  Eth and ltc are good but why now would you preach against the real bitcoin BCH? Is that because you’ve been fed lies?

What do you warn them about? Bitcoin Cash is bitcoin bruh.  You’ve been fed so many lies.

You obviously can’t see what’s right in front of you.  Companies dropping btc core coin because it’s shit.  Replacing it with BCH.  Nice try.

Be careful where you get your information.  Don’t trust anyone and form your own opinions.  Especially on this sub.

If she had accepted that bitcoin there is no way in hell she’d have held for this long.  I know weak hands when I see them.  She’d have sold at 5$.
