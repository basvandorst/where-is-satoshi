I bought at $20K. It will rise again, it is only a matter of time. While waiting I will enjoy Christmas with my family.

Pro tip guys: I’m liquidating some fiat to be able to buy more crypto this week, but it will take a few days for the transfers to go through to Kraken (because... long live fiat transaction speed), so bitcoin price will probably double tomorrow or just a few moments before I wanna invest - my usual luck ��

 My prophecy is already turning out to be true ��

What do you prefer instead? I like kraken

Computers do not survive EMP (result of nuclear bombs - NEMP) but the code in this vault is printed on a film which can withstand EMP (since it is a analogue storing , and not electronical).

I really do hope that postning this video here (sounded like he/the event organizer wanted it to not be shared) does not endanger Snowden in any way.

Not suprising at all:
China is HUGE
Hardware is produced in China, thus cheap(er)
Electricity is kind of cheap

Well Bcash will hardly be the first crypto project to incorporate Schnorr signatures, Zilliqa has already done it.

On Coinmarketcap.com a coin named "Lightening Bitcoin Futures" is listed, being traded on some exchanges. What is that even? Sounds scammy? As I have understood it from reading this awesome thread Lightening = Bitcoin, not its own currency. So that coin listed on coinmarketcap.com must be a scam?

I've the whole 44 page report in Swedish. In fact they are not specifically considering Bitcoin but rather blockchain technology - without naming a certain blockchain. 
In the report they say it would be interesting to support offline payments. 
Which blockchain technology would be best for that?

Clickbait title, sorry for that! I think I might have misunderstood the buy orders - my bad!
It looks like the buyer is the _broker_ called "JP Morgan Securities". That does not mean it is the actually company JP Morgan "themselves" that buy bitcoins, right?
This could be any private person buying _through_ the _broker_ JP Morgan Securities, right?
So sorry for clickbait title and that I misunderstood it.

LOL?! Bitcoin IS Communism (as in Marxism, as in power of/to/by the people, and not central banks. In which other *-ism has central banks an essential role now again? Some other *-ism in the West I believe.
You are confusing Communism with Stalianism/Maoism, which indeed were totalitarianism under a dictator.

Ok here it goes, I will probably get lots of downvotes, even though I have added disclaimers that this is my own personal biased preferences and believes:
I don't hold any BTC at all. Only alts and not even ETH. Because I like EXTREME risk. Holding some BTC and some ETH might be a good idea. But apparently I'm into the crazy extreme risk of the crazy extreme risk that Crypto in general is.
Zilliqa is an interesting challenger, since it is the first project to have launched with Sharding and thus the first blockchain with linear scaling. Might not be the first DLT with linear scaling, but at least the first blockchain, and Zilliqa also has support for smart contracts, like Ethereum.
NEO is also an interesting alternative to Ethereum, a bit more corporate-oriented I think, at least they seem to have pivoted towards that with Neo 3 roadmap.
Nano is a great project for just payments, extremely fast, no fees. Better than Litecoin and Bitcoin in being just a payment coin. Scales well since it is not a blockchain, it is a DAG.
But in long run I think it will really come down to either Radix DLT, with superior tech, or Hedera Hashgraph. Hedera is kind of centralized and has inferior tech to Radix DLT. Radix with its tempo conensus is neither a blockchain nor a DAG. It does not use Proof-of-Stake - like Hedera does - which itself has some game theory problems. Radix is something completely new. But Hedera is great at marketing, just great. They have interesting tech and a really strong position with the global council. So I think it will boil down to those two being the industry standard in the future.

So OP, you are asking for some suggestion of a portfolio right? If I respond it is likely that the portfolio I propose is biased and I might own some of those coins myself. Others in this thread might also downvote/upvote my reply based on their bias. So always do your own research. Always assume bias.
How would you like to proceed? Do you still want me to name some projects that I personally in my biased opinion believe to be good investment alternatives to BTC?
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:27:13
What are you talking about? I honestly do not understand what you are trying to say.
