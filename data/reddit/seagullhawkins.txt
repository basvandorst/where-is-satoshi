Another supplementary question to the brains of the sector (you) - how do you guys fundamentally value Bitcoin? Obviously you guys focus on a market derived price, but am keen for your thoughts on valuation methodology and assumptions

Hey guys - do you guys foresee the development of an exchange traded derivatives market in China (or greater Asia) for alt currencies anytime soon?

Also, why has Bitcoin become so popular in China, and is that interest still there given the relative absence of upward movements in the price lately?

Also, given you guys are China based, what are your thoughts on expansion? Which are the most friendly Bitcoin jurisdictions in the world in your experience?

I opened their website just then and seems that they do sell Gucci!

Agree with most of the comments, but aren't we being a tad bit naive to assume that Paypal won't surmount  these competitive issues prior to entering into this space? 
Lets be frank here, they aren't from Sesame Street. They have talented people that can surely structure something so that they are very competitive...

Thanks all for the insights, I guess a couple of things that came to mind when I was reading everyone's thoughts:
A. Although Paypal don't operate in all jurisdictions, they do operate operate in all the major markets that Bitcoin is currently used and mined (major markets being the US and continental Europe)
B. Agree on the push for an alternative, but if Paypal do make the decision enter into the Bitcoin sphere, they will have only made it if they are of the view that they can compete against the competitors who have lower fees. If they have a suitable risk management and commercial structure in place, and can be comfortable with the risk and can compete on cost, then surely this would make sense to them?
C. Re APIs, surely these are merely temporal and can be spruced up and updated? Technological innovation etc?

 a little confused, are you suggesting that Bitcoin will only ever be accepted by techies?? Might be smoking dope here, but aren't they trying to look to the future of digital currencies?
