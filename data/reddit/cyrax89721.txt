I think it's safe to assume somebody who has the ability to hack 120k Bitcoins from an exchange has done similar in the past and has a stash already available that they can dip from, so I wouldn't put him out of the woods yet.  Those coins in particular might not be directly tied to the hack, but I guess we'll find out within a week if the person is trying to launder via giveaways.  In this case he may just be doing it with 3 year old stolen coins.

Microtransactions to pay for the file and/or bandwidth, eliminating the pay-by-month model.  I would also assume he plans on doing these transactions offchain and this 'Bitcache' is just another online wallet.

Can you just wait for them to post their official update later?  You can also look through Zane's earlier posts to see that he can't say much at this time.
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:38:16


Zane has been (on par) answering questions every 5 to 10 minutes on Reddit for the last three days straight with maybe 10 hours of sleep in between.  If he could have answered these questions directly, he would have by now.  Let them at least get their ducks in a row.
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:08:44
Holy hell dude, I can't believe you're still here answering questions.  I fear if you close your eyes right now, you'll be zonked out for a good 10 hours.  Reminder to update that FAQ on the OP!  Keep kicking ass dude, you deserve a raise (+ lost funds of course).
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:28:38
Just because these particular coins aren't straight from the Bitfinex hack doesn't mean he's not the guy.

Betking.io is as high volume as they come.  That site has nearly 5,000 BTC invested and has profitted more than 3,000 over the past year alone.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:59:59
Well yeah, I kind of figured that went without saying, but a lot of people seem to be glossing over my point, thinking that the thief would only be capable of giving away coins directly tied to the heist.
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:11:25
Coinbase is also doing a Security AMA on Tuesday, so Sherlock here could ask them directly then to clarify anything he doesn't understand from that link.
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:07:34
Assuming that we keep track of every random thread for some meta reference is even worse.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:14:11
Because these are outliers.  I've had zero issues buying, transferring, and selling large amounts of money through Coinbase, and I'm sure hundreds of thousands (millions?) of others are in the same camp as me.

I hope to one day visit a Cryptocurrency related thread where there isn’t a cynical asshole to ruin it.

From my recollection, lots of Coinbase features were a slow roll-out.  Especially the ones involving buys and sells.

It seems nobody can ever vent anymore without somebody else being like "whelp, you fucking deserved it."

@_date: 2017-12-09 14:57:32
I just mean in general.  I've been around for about 4 years now, so even $1500 seemed a huge amount of money to me.
$1500 - Ridiculous
$5000 - Ludicrous
$15000 - ~~I'm out of superlatives~~  Quite Good
I can't even imagine what the $0.10 guys feel like.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:12:31
It's really not as deep as that.  I'm just basing it on my personal experience.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:18:05
Anything above $1500 still sounds ridiculous to me.

Well they could have picked a better image.  You can see what he means by it looking centralized.
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:09:20
and the thread
From what I can tell, the guy was one of the forerunners in GPU mining for Bitcoin, so he was probably one of the first to get a substantial hashrate boost over a lot of other folks and their puny CPU miners.
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:41:30
Right.  I hate having to look up all the prefixes since I haven't made it to memorizing them all yet.  I still am content with the simple .00000001 style denominations.

You're acting as if you don't understand the point he's making.  Take it easy.

I came into this thread expecting to see this link at the top.  I thought it was common knowledge by now. Apparently not..?
@_date: 2014-09-26 00:01:45
So what's the deal with this Circle place?  The main page of the website just rambles on about Bitcoin as an entity and not much about the site itself.  Is it just another exchange?
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:32:29
Right, I tried that with my check card and it didn't work.  The debit card is linked straight to the same bank account, so they're smarter than I thought. ;-)  Don't have any credit cards either.
@_date: 2014-11-19 18:27:02
I had been using Coinbase before, but I liked that Circle was instant with minimal fees.  
My bank is really picky, and ironically Circle would allow me to do Debit purchases but wouldn't link my bank while Coinbase allows me to link my bank but not do Debit purchases.  Such is life.  Guess I'm back to waiting 3-4 days for a cleared deposit.
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:38:40
See, now I'd be completely comfortable with a CC that had no money!
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:23:08
He said "In this case", referring to the post above his, not the current situation.
@_date: 2014-11-19 18:28:55
I guess I didn't anticipate that Circle would be having internal issues this soon.  Maybe fraud and an unexpected increase in popularity is kicking their ass?  Hopefully they'll be able to turn it around.  I still don't know how they managed to get away with such cheap fees to begin with.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:40:10
Circle just replied to me (this being less than 20 hours after I first sent the email to support) saying that they had no holds on my account and requested a screenshot of the issue.  I tried to log in again, and sure enough the issue was gone.  Not quite sure what happened, but maybe they just wanted to confirm that I'm human?  I've not had any other issues with them to date.  Debit card works just fine, and all my deposits and withdrawals have been instant.  
It sucks seeing so many others are having consistent issues.  I replied to their support response with a link to this thread encouraging them to give responses to all of you that are still having issues.  Here's to hoping they'll hop in here and clear the air.

As well as peering eyes at the local bar.  It's much more difficult to spot a pin number input when you can't see what numbers they're inputting. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 22:59:31
Honest question here -- Since the addresses linked to the hack will be watched like a hawk, how likely is it that the person(s) will be able to spend them?  I know mixing services exist, but there still has to be *some* link that any reputable exchange or mixing service would pick up on, right?
@_date: 2016-01-15 05:00:41
At least I've got my CryptsyPoints.
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:18:54
Then why have my &gt;1 BTC transactions with a .0002 fee attached taken more than 4 blocks to confirm?
@_date: 2016-01-06 23:36:56
I can confirm that Doge will have a better chance of withdrawing.  I used that to get my balance out of there.  I know it's probably not the wisest thing to do, but to avoid the ~20% loss to the conversion rate, I deposited the Doge to a gambling site and made up the loss that way.  
I'm sure you'll get some condescending smartass replies in this thread, but just ignore them.  Alt coins are really your only option for withdrawing unfortunately.

Shitty Bitcoin startups and ponzi's have been doing this for years.  They just look for the top 20-50 richest addresses and shoot them a .0001 BTC deposit because they know people are looking at those addresses.  Probably an easy script...

Chances are that Circle is stuck with the rest of us in the 40,000+ Transaction backlog and can't withdraw your coins until they have the coins available to them in their "hot wallet" to send to you.
Edit: It appears Coinbase is in the same situation.  I withdrew coins about two hours ago and it has yet to show up in the withdrawal address.  Everybody, including exchanges, are stuck waiting.

Christ dude, relax.  All I'm saying is the universal answer for the great majority of people that are waiting is simply because of the massive backlog.  You're over-complicating things.

Ever since reading the Gizmodo articles that revolve around [Craig Wright]( &amp; [David Kleiman]( I've been avoiding saying it myself because it's a bit of a tongue-in-cheek hypothesis, but now that you put it out there, I might as well say what I've been thinking all along:  Craig Wright killed Satoshi (Kleiman) and stole his coins.
Can't wait for the movie.

Their policy regarding Pakistan might not have been in place at that time.  They're still a fairly new company and are adapting to regulations as they become aware of them.

So don't use the old addresses when depositing.  Also, the betting cold wallet isn't public, nor do deposits automatically go to there.
@_date: 2016-07-17 23:18:46
The site owner is well aware of this, but when you have 100 people complaining because they mistakenly deposited to an old address and he has to manually confirm it, it made sense to keep the old addressses activated.  
For what it's worth, I've been depositing straight to the site for months and have had zero issues.
