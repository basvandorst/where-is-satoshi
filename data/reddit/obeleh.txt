I was thinking... He's probably got his nephew or something as his "IT department"

usd deposits are closed until they get incorporated. Btc deposits are still open. Afaik this is the only platform that supports margin trading. They have their own orderbook as wel but most orders are routed to mtgox. Ive heard talks about them looking into supporting multiple exchanges.

True, but you could still separate into a public cloud and a private cloud so that you could still do some form of autoscaling.

Just this week I was wondering: If there is a weekly dip, at what point will there by a dip that has a longer cycle time than a week and has a far deeper bottom

Gives a whole new perspective on CPU-Cycles

I managed to make 20% profit last night. (price is at $92 right now)
It appears to have been a well orchestrated attack. 
They've been DDos-ing BTC exchanges to increase the panic.

Ow :(

The first one to build a meta-exchange will win the race I think.

But would flat per head be fair? I think that for a lot of people that would mean they would have to start paying more taxes. Even though you just cut some costs in step 3

They also have DDos mitigation from cloudfare

I would like to point to this thread: [alternatives to mtGox](
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:32:21
Our dependency on mtGox is too big.

To do list:
* Buy a truckload of BTC. 
* Figure out some way to send future self a message and make sure it doesn't get lost. 
* Get a [blue pill](
* Time goes by BTC goes up (cross your blissfull/unknowing fingers)
* One day wake up and get read that there should be X bitcoins waiting for you

Well, for now.. they will still need to convert it to Fait money at some time.

Anyone here who thinks that the transaction costs weigh up against the delivered service quality?
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:04:48
Could you please provide a basis for your statement?
Edit: After seeing your edit. Forget I ever asked.
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:03:00
she's going there

For what reason do you think you're better equipped than Amazon to handle the load and scaling issues you're dealing with? Or, can you express with hard data why Amazon would be a bad fit? "not meant for large scale operations such as trading systems" Doesn't convince me. There are enough large scale operations running on Amazon. And since the average trading speed of mtGox does not nearly come close to a sustained &lt;100ms/transaction I see no reason why Amazon wouldn't work. In fact to me it seems that mtGox is an archetypal example of why you should not run your own systems if you want to scale well.

Thank you. For me as non-american it is strange that people want to live under constant debt. With mortgage you don't have a choice so I see it as a necessary evil. But credit card is all voluntary debt. 
As they obligatory say in our Dutch Tv advertisements: "Borrowing money costs money"

They had both
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:37:04
Do you have a source for that? (honestly curious)
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:44:48
You're going to have to build redundancy anyway.

It's working [Someone has deposited some BTC](
@_date: 2013-03-15 13:33:47
That's going to be a nice leg up!
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:21:37
Isn't that like saying you're more capable than Amazon? 
@_date: 2013-03-30 18:00:04
Interesting step 0 :)
