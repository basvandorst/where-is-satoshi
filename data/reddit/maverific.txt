Coinmap is open source if you want to contribute -  - but having said that competition is a good thing

Kodiak just recently stopped accepting bitcoin. coinmap.org has all the merchants that I know of in Melbourne.

'Unwalled' is the kind of vibe I reckon you should go for in naming this store. Maybe something like 'Garden of Eden'... something that plays on the walled-garden concept Apple seems to love so much.

Easiest depends on what you need to be easy (location, speed, fees, anonymous etc), but the list in order from my perspective is:
* 
* ATM at The Hub cnr Bourke and Spencer in Melbourne CBD - there are other ATMs out there but I don't know them.
* Mycelium local trader
* Localbitcoins.com
* Coinjar
* Other exchange such as bitstamp

ie These wallets - 
I tried this out and couldn't get the Android wallet to scan the BIP73 QR. It shows an error "Cannot classify input: 
What am I doing wrong?

From the Epilogue: "I still have the bitcoins from the early days of mining. More precisely, I still have the private keys in a safe place (not on me or in my home). I realize they now equate to a fortune, but I intend to never use them."
It would be great to see a signed message from one of these private keys.

You make good arguments and I also see what you're saying. I agree with you on the economic theory you put forward about inflation encouraging productivity but feel you are creating a misleading argument by exaggeration.
"Deflationary economies punish those who hold physical assets and reward those with currency."
Let's flip that
Inflationary economies punish those who hold currency and reward those with physical assets.
But we still see physical assets being sold all the time! And people still bust a gut earning this ridiculous currency! Why do people do that, those lunatics! The same notion applies in a deflationary economy. People will still buy and sell.
You argue people will be less productive in a deflationary economy, but I don't think so. If you the money you earn today will be worth more in the future, you will definitely try to earn that money today rather than in five years. Deflation doesn't hinder productivity.
I think you are exaggerating the real-world effects of deflation. No evidence, no proof, just my opinion.
edit: We have been talking about a shop selling soda, where the effect of inflation/deflation is trivial compared to the value of the item in the expected life from buying to selling. I admit, I have not considered the economic effect of deflation on, say, a long-term large-scale project such as a company building a skyscraper. I would be interested to see someone run through an example of how inflation/deflation affects projects such as these, where the economic effects will indeed be noticed and not be merely a 'trick of psychology'

This is a slightly disingenuous argument.
Part of the price that the shop sells their soda includes the 'markup'. This markup, no matter the actual sale price, be it 10btc or 7btc will remain constant. Whilst I can't say for sure, it is likely that over the life of the sale of a product, the amount of markup (say 10%) is far more significant than the amount of value decrease due to deflation (which I can't say how much this would be). The numbers we are using in the example kinda hide this. To rephrase your story to better reflect the situation:
A shop buys a can of soda for 10btc and wants to sell it for 11btc. But it takes him 3 months to sell it and deflation has caused the soda to be now worth 9.95 so the shop has to sell it for 10.95.  Has the shop 'lost money' considering their new sale price is still 0.95 better than what they bought the soda for?
The shop adds a markup to account for the value they add to the product (convenience of purchase, good customer service, whatever). Bitcoin and deflation do not erode that added-value. That value always remains in the sale price of the soda. There are situations with heavy deflation where indeed this becomes a problem, but this is not only a problem with deflation, we also see it as a problem with extreme inflation.
To put it another way, with inflation, if I buy a soda for $10 and then sell it (much) later for $12, have I made more money than if I'd sold it right away? Maybe more 'money', but certainly not more 'value'.
@_date: 2012-12-30 22:37:56
You are missing the point that not only the shop item is decreasing in value but so is every other item in the world. So if the shop sells a soda at 10btc they can buy something else 'soda-valued' with that 10btc, but if it takes a while to sell and they sell it at 7btc later, they can still use that 7btc at that time to buy the same 'soda-valued' item which was previously 10btc but is now also 7btc.
I agree that debt and bitcoin/deflation combined is troublesome, but deflation itself is not.

One is in 'The Hub' in Melbourne CBD

 seems much simpler. But this is certainly an interesting implementation.

You need to explain clearly on your site:
- why this is better than a trusted timestamping authority (using RFC 3161)
- where the timestamp is stored and how susceptible it is to being compromised
- the legal status of your timestamping service (I know there is no precedent but you need to say whether it would stand in a court of law)
- whether the document timestamp is still valid if your service/website/database is compromised
I can't really say whether your service is good or not - you need more information on your site. But it's promising as a start.
Bitcoin has a lot of potential in this area, good to see someone trying to make it happen.
The biggest challenge you have is not the timestamping itself but getting customers to understand why it's superior to existing solutions. I spent a lot of time trying to explain my own bitcoin timestamping system (using chronobit) to a bunch of geeks, and none of them understood it. The marketing / explaining is by far the hardest part of this project.

Not a good project for a n00b.
If you insist, check out the json-rpc 
Or, also, have a look at some online wallets which may have APIs, you can use their apis to support your service.
Without knowing your programming background or strengths/weaknesses it is hard to recommend how to approach the project, both on a "what to do" basis and a "should you be trusted with other people's money" basis.

~90 minutes of solid and engaging conversation... it was an epic meet up. Please post a link to the video if you upload it somewhere.
