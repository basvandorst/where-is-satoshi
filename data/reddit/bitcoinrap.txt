if you by mistake would trade using this rate, then you would receive less soms than you sent bitcoins, because Google and all different web-sites represent lowered prices of their currency - because of their government's gestapo. Real truth is that this rate should be x2 higher to meet its real market price traded on the streets.

no, its not. My friends in Uzbekistan said that this is official government rate. While their real rate is something like 2800000.00 Uzbekistani Som (market price).
They have market price vs government price. But if you want to buy dollars from government, you have to wait 1 year in electronic line (because their rate is artificial)

I think this post is useful to geeks to realize the problem. Most people who love Bitcoin automatically keep recommending Coinbase, which is good for coinbase and government, but bad for Bitcoin.
Using other EXCHANGES hard for even most  experienced people, because they're not so reliable as coinbase

It doesn't matter on which blockchain it would be recorded, on bitcoin's, namecoin's or on other privately owned blockchain. Main criteria for me is ability to register free domain names in uncensored way.
Also it doesn't matter what is the way to simplify this kind of domain system, main idea is making it very-very simple to use to get **censorship-resistant** permanent ADDRESS on the WEB. You could even run 10000 centralized web-sites from 10000 participants who own these types of simplified nodes, and when you navigate to one of this centralized web-site, I could see 1 big input field "Enter name to visit" which could then scan its blockchain, find/or not find entry and automatically redirect you there without necessity to change my local DNS servers which is too complicated for newbies (even if its just "reddirect" entry without ability to set your NS, A, CNAME settings)
I believe that the whole Bitcoin's ecosystem sucks right now if there's still no such solution. What's the whole point of namecoin if I can't navigate to some quick web-form to create domain system for minimum fee e.g. $0.5 per domain is still cheaper than most registrars

Why nobody of you carefully listen to Andreas? Everyone is so lazy that you don't even pay attention to the main question. Question says 50 transactions = 1 pound. Not correct.
Andreas didn't said this anywhere. Listen to Andreas and understand him accurately: "What are you gonna do with 1 pound with Bitcoin, well **what you can do with 1 pound in Bitcoin is about 50 transactions**". Nothing and nowhere in his speeches said about cost or fee of BTC transactions. Andreas says that you can spend 1 pound on sending money to 50 people. Or sending money to buy 50 products to test out Bitcoin (even though its going to be mostly cheap or almost free digital products like games, playing casino for 1 cent, or watching 1 video).
Concerning fee, in Bitcoin you pay around 1 cent for each transaction. Its not measured in %. Its measured by fixed price. Which means that you can pay 1 cent to transfer $1000 dollars which is something like 0.01% fee. Transferring anything less than $1000, then complaining for paying 1 cent is idiocy and laziness. Because I won't believe that your minute of labor costs less than 1 cent (sending transaction is action = labor = at least 1 minute of your work which should be paid, spent).
You can complain that Bitcoin have 50% fees if average size of your transaction is 2 cents all you want. Mostly this math is misunderstood not because people are poor, but because people mathematically blind.

is it technically possible to scale syncing blockchain with third level subdomains of legacy domain system on an individual node?
@_date: 2015-12-12 18:30:02


 You could even run 10000 centralized web-sites from 10000 participants who own these types of simplified nodes
Point is having 10000 participants who run their own nodes, and where each of them are having 1 main domain. If you visit MillyBitcoin.user1.com and his node is offline, then you can go to MillyBitcoin.user2.com and so on. Every subdomain should be synchronized with blockchain.
And that was my question, what is the obstacle in scaling up: "is it technically possible to scale syncing blockchain with third level subdomains of legacy domain system on an individual node?"

But you can't admit that 5 days is a big problem, first of all because volatility during 5 days will eat out all of your money if you would pay all expenses of the customer yourself. Two factors expose Bitcoin's adoptors to huge money loses: 1) fee; 2) speed: if customer given tools to transact immediately, and with no fee, then everyone is happy because 0% lost because of volatility. Bitcoin is too unpredictible not for fast transactions, but for long waitings like 5 days. You don't know what Bitcoin's price gonna be in 5 days.
Also most customers don't understand that coinbase is only 1st step to get your money delivered to destination in different country. 2nd step is the exchange at the point B, this is too complicated scheme for most "normal" people, everyone stop calling them lazy because of that.
PayPal sends money in almost every country for 3.5% which is better even with long days, because it doesn't exposes you to Bitcoin's volatility. That's how customer thinks.
You are responsible for making process smooth during the whole chunk of Coinbase - Global Bitcoin transaction - Local exchange at destination country, and money can be lost at every of this steps, and you will be guilty because customers eager to lose their money often at any of this steps, because customer will feel like MtGoxed and he's never coming back!

Hank Green's article on  about this topic: 
I posted this on just to show another way how huge corporations like facebook stealing money from regular people, and how many of their victims (content creators) just unaware of the problem. Platforms like WatchMyBit could solve the problem completely by flexible payment settings.
Mark Zukenberg, thank you for destroying our privacy over the years, consuming our time with endless days spent on your ads and extracting enormous value from it and now destroying young careers. Yes, this is just my opinion and you may not agree with it, but facebook is a huge evil corporation controlling the world, worth for geting rid of it, just to bring more safety to future generations.

actually you could use $5 physical big bitch computer to make it offline and figure out how to sign transaction using node.js + javascript ready web-scripts, does the same thing as Trezor minus portability. Yeah 95% for portability is okay.
And yes I agree that people who know Bitcoin by definition above the average in wealth if they know how to dominate traditional financial philosophy through Bitcoin

So basically this app lets me, as wireless fiat credit card owner, to give permission to other wireless user to use my fiat credit card remotely at his retail location in exchange for Bitcoins. That's something new!
On the user end, that's finally meets ultimate goal of Bitcoin - privacy (imo). Since if I don't want to show my identity to the retail store where I shopping, then its my right: e.g. I wouldn't want my purchases at sex-shop appear at family credit card transactions list.

I'm not looking on this problem the way you do. I would use it for different things than you imagine. The problem is that currently we need at least some decentralized system, it doesn't matter how does it integrates with legacy DNS, I think experts will figure out how to make best front end.
As backend I expect some reliable uncensorable system and I don't care if it only works as "Skype Login". E.g. if you're running marketplace on TOR with temporary address, then even Skype Login would suffice as DNS. Because in case if government shutdowns your servers, but if all of users will be updated over Skype about new address, that's all that is needed.
Does Skype Login should be resistant to malware phishing redirection? No, because Skype doesn't have such a problem.

Trezor costs $100 which is 7500 rubles. Its around 50% of salary. Not worth it at all. Way higher than expected. For most people using fiat better option than paying for security.
Some African people collect $30 for two years for spending it for purchasing a bicycle. This is the reality for most people on earth.

This is not only about illusions or Gavin's opinion. Just look at it technically...

Nobody knows what's going to happen tomorrow. Tomorrow some incredible technology can come out and it can blow all the bandwidth.
Government is even in more trouble raising their debt, because they don't want to ruin the system even though everyone knows that everything is screwed.
Tomorrow we might not have expected growth of Bitcoin's userbase. In fact tomorrow we could face decline in transactions. Yes I also want to believe that Bitcoin's activity grows exponentially, but again, it is going to happen tomorrow.
Just hypothetically: Maybe if we would raise block to 1.5mb maybe everyone could calm down for a year or two?! Who knows. 
I think blocksize is a none-issue at all because there is 10000 worthwhile things to discuss that can go wrong. For me blocksize debate is wasting precious dev time for non-issues.
