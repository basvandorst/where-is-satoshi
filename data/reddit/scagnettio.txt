You can buy them in Beijing as well, found them at a company that organises tours to North Korea. They also have other stuff like NK propaganda posters and the like.

They where quitte expensive. I don't know the exact price but I had a quite the budget but they were way to expensive for me. They told me they were hand made, no real mass production that's how they explained the cost. But I did buy two packs of smokes :)

Well that's the only way to hide your money as a public official after this debacle is over :p I wonder if more hard to regulate financial products and services is something the current population of Iceland is waiting for but it will be interesting to see what happens.

Lol this whole discussion was stupid as hell and I really wasn't going to participate but you argument is flawed. 
Yes a government has a huge overhead because it's a large bureaucratic apparatus. Does this mean that poverty on a national level would be better handled through charitable donations instead of taxes? No! There is a whole apparatus of people who look at how money can be used to help the lesser fortunate of society. As long as the goverment isn't corrupt wealth distribution is much more equal and effective on a national level then through taxes as by charitable donations.
The difference is that if you give to your church or directly to the homeless guy on the corner you see a direct impact. Through taxes maybe three homeless people are helped but they are from different parts of the country. In the latter case you might not notice it. 
Higher tax rate (adjusted for corruption in a country) is directly related to lower levels of poverty even compared to countries with much higher levels of charitable donations per capita.

How does this work in the sense that I can order a pizza with bitcoin and not with gold. If I buy 5 lambos with bitcoins it becomes realising gains; do you have to pay taxes on that amount? 
This is just from curiousity, I'm not in the US so different rules would apply for me and I have just enough in bitcoins to pay for one large pizza.

Probably 3 million are lost as well.

The memes can't keep up with the current price increase. We reached our peak at 9000 for everything that came after we have shown woefully unprepared.
People better start working on the 100k posts allready because I felt let down in the last week.

Neither had little innovation at this point. That doesn't mean it's bad. Bitcoin is the ultimate conservative crypto at the moment. It works and it's safe. The lack of changes makes it secure. This means it doesn't scale well with regards to transactions but that just shifts it's focus from a currency to a very safe asset which is also needed in the space. A very safe and secure crypto asset is what people want from bitcoin at the moment.

If Whatsapp stopped allowing people to send pictures anymore because it put to much strain on their severs I would leave a one star review. And go to another messaging app. 
Saying that review is dishonest because they are now only a texting app and no longer an image sharing app is just plain stupid. They cut out a feature and people who used the app for that specific future are disgruntled. 
Of course when circle first announced to stop supporting bitcoin people on this sub said they would reinstall the app just to leave a bad review. That's wrong, if you don't use the app, what are you reviewing? That's just weak in my opinion. 
Personally I have never used circle and never left a review for that reason.

I think the Americans compared to all other Western countries are the most fearful of the government.

How do you evenly spread this crypto while there are people with lots of assets who snag it up?

While I agree that the switch to sustainable energy does relief the issue somewhat I do not think it will solve it.
I'd bitcoin would be used/adopted more the price will rise. A rise in price will lead to a increase in miners and therefore an increase in energy expenditure. So if/when bitcoin does get mainstream adoption it will require a multitude of its current energy use. Even with solar and wind this will require enormous amounts of materials and investment while I think the chances are larger that we look for an alternative cryptographic platform.

Which will net a fee similair to a credit card. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:57:07
Maybe in the long run. Setting up a viable and credible escrow will take ages. Credit cards can offer this quite effectively because they have different streams of revenue and are ahead because they have been doing it for over a decade. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:58:23
I don't quite understand your comment. If the price rises the hashrate will go up right?
Adoption means an higher price of bitcoin. Meaning that the energy consumption of the network will not be just transaction fee based. A higher price of bitcoin will lead to an enormous increase of hashrate as opposed to the increase in the power to confirm transactions from merely an increase in adoption.

It isn't as easy to buy a few million dollars worth of bitcoins and get then out of an exchange. Using an ordinary escrow service is easier and safer for the large players.

I don't see how just smartcontracts could fully fill this role. If one party disputes  the transaction between an exchange of crypto for a good or service (in the case of crypto it would be only the receiver of the good service because payments can be checked in the chain) a third party has to check the claim that a party didn't fulfill his role in the exchange/purchase of the good or service.
You buy a pair of shoes. These shoes are not the correct ones (fake, wrong size, whatever). You either have already paid or you don't release the funds from an escrow smartcontract. In the latter case you need a third party to look at the evidence by both parties to which party is in the wrong and thus who should receive funds.
A great example we have are actually the darknet markets. We see that an authority is needed to check up on disputes between vendor and buyer. 
While the buyer can proof he has the funds by placing them in escrow. Unless the product has a foolproof chip embedded a smartcontract can not check if the right product has been delivered.

I see the fees most likely being solved through technological means in the future. The PoW seems like such a core tenet of bitcoin I think this aspect will hinder its adoption in the future.

This is a non-argument. An actual heater is atleast 100 times as efficient in producing heat. A miner as heater to pay for the electricity bill is, in terms of electricity efficiency, a horrible idea. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:30:38
The fact that's its PoW is energy inefficient/intensive is the only thing I can think of.

They sold like what 36 thousand bitcoins over a period of months out of a total 180 thousand total or something right?

So he filed for bankruptcy right. What happens when the assets held are raising in value to such an extend all outstanding debt is cleared. Are the funds returned or handed over to the authorities? A crime took place so I think they would be moved from being held to being seized/confiscated? 
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:35:23
Maybe on digital goods but bitcoin doesn't provide any consumer protection. Things like PayPal and creditcards allow to check the product bought after the fact. It's not just money transfer it is also an org who checks if the two parties involved in the transaction have been fair.

All Rwandan people I know have been affected by the genocide. That's the reason I know them. They fled, they all lost family during the genocide. 
I don't know anyone who was personally affected by 9/11 but I would still think it would be a total dick move if they stated that 'the currencies crumbling down was worse then the collapse of the WTC'. 
Of course you can make such jokes to friends and whoever from which you are pretty sure they understand the joke and are not affected. But to throw it out in public why would you?

Strong point. To bad a site about crypto news can't even get their. Numbers correct. The genocide was in 1994.

Around that time I was reading about CPU sharing software and the such. Read about bitcoin but chose to run a program that used CPU calculations to find a new medicine (for cancer or something?). Atleast my decision at that time means I haven't lost millions worth of bitcoin at its current price. So that's something I guess.
