No it tells me not enough funds.But it tries to send from my btc wallet which doesn't have funds. Bitpay will not connect to the wallet labeled bch with the C address which does have .16989 bch. Also if I try to send from bch wallet to bitcoin.com wallet(which does start with a q) message is Copay only sends bch using new version numbers address.

I've tried. My  Coinbase bch wallet does not recognize the bch address from bitpay! It begins with a C. And therein lies the confusion

The bch came from my BRD wallet. At the time of fork bitpay was the only wallet I had that would accept bch. Bitpay has a procedure of you dig deep enough. Personally I'm just not experienced enough to understand and it very technical.  I will research more on the export idea. Let you know Thanks

I'm a newbie and it definitely confuses me. I still have bch on bitpay from the fork and no wallets recognize the address. Basically its stuck and everytime I try to figure it out it's very confusing and I quit. Many of the altcoin projects are much more user friendly then btc/bch for the average person , such as myself, with no computer coding skills. This is the biggest drawback in blockchain/crypto in my opinion.  Until it becomes average person user friendly mass adoption will be slow. All the unfriendly rhetoric infighting between bitcoin is a total turn off.

Thanks everyone for trying to help. I'm out of time and patience right now. I do have other btc wallets that work perfectly.  No bcash for me I guess. Glta

That address is bch in bitpay! It is bch I recieved after the Aug 1st form. At least that is what it is listed as. Maybe my mistake but I'm really still very new.

Thank you I'll try

I opened a bitcoin .com wallet and tried to send from bitpay . Doesn't recognize address as bch.

I've experienced BRD not recognize a Bitpay address buying from Overstock.  Thinking Bitpay is mostly at fault in those situations.

Truly confusing and misleading for new people. Makes me look into other crypto projects that are not as confusing and then bam ....find out the founder was part of bitcoin to begin with and went out and had a bigger better idea. Deep wormhole.

Much more than 80% IMO. Central banks and the real PTB don't want us to have knowledge of our convoluted system. It is not part of any curriculum. One has to study on ones own and be open-minded enough to put the pieces together and believe in ways that go against everything we have been told to think about money.
