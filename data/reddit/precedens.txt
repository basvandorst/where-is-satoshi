Sorry, but what would be the difference? If both work same and operate on same rules, what is the ultimate difference between them other than one was altered during one coin being operable and the other was brought to life.

Tether news, fees (now low because of lower volume), LN not any time soon, losing BTC sporadically. Also, other coins offer better tech. I am not saying it won't go to 100k, I hope it does, I love BTC, but people are losing faith in BTC. Imagine what would happen to price if exchanges dropped it as a main pair, I think most people would not touch it.
People still have sentiment, but other coins offer better solutions and are more flexible. Saying that I think in long term BTC will go up, but now every crypto suffers and bitcoin connects all.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:42:34
It's not twice as easy, to go from 10k to 100k you would need exponentially more money going into it than from 900 to 19k. You see the difference? 90k vs 18.1k. I am not saying it's not possible, personally I believe in this prediction, but you can't say it's twice as easy.

You can send BTC to other wallet that is linked to payment system that allows instant withdrawal, ie atm, but I doubt it will be easy to find one for you, it's still in early age of adoption. Fees are high right now as well, mempool is clogged, so you pay nice chunk to miners.

Crypto is NOT for that average people.
So wait, crypto community wants crypto become global and mainstream, yet it's not for average people for some reason now. I suppose this argument fluctuates as long as it fits your narrative.
That someone is blessed with slavery for his/her lifetime.
Now you think you have a moral high ground against someone who tries to have a family and working hard for it? Get a grip with reality, it's not about being blessed with a slavery, it's just life. You can't have millionaires everywhere. I don't know how old are you, but I had same mentality when I was 20-25. Now I close to 30, still without kids, but your priorities change fast. I also think that living off of crypto alone is not smart, having a career is also important, for mental and social health.
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:29:59

Hurr Durr have fun storing your crypto yourself and always have this small doubt in back of  your head if it's not hacked. I am definitely not saying brokers are good, but banks that store and insure your coins same as they do with fiat is the next thing. Usual Joe will always put his money in bank instead of storing it by himself.
@_date: 2018-05-12 22:07:57
Yes I did. For average people these things mean nothing. Someone who is working full time and has a family does not want to think about any of these things, he just wants his money/crypto on secure account that is insured and managed by competent people.
I know how to store crypto, but I would switch to a bank in a heart beat, most people would.

@_date: 2018-10-26 21:52:51
LN is channel based. Maybe trustless but at the end still there is something in middle to make payments possible.

They take USD from customers, and instead of using it to buy actual BTC, they print Tether and buy BTC with it.

I was referring to people here preaching "be your own bank". Most people are not interested in it at all, as it's shown by them keeping all their crypto on exchanges.
You said Coinbase (centralized entity) just proves that crypto is needed. It actually shows how ironic it is in current state of things, as most people don't give a fuck if centralized companies store their coins. They're just buying crypto to sell it later to profit, and where and how it's stored is second worry. People do not use crypto to circumvent centralization, just to get rich. Anarchist here that scream banks should die are minority that does not reflect real world, where working people need banks or some sort of entity that safely stores their valuables (yes, you can  argue about bailouts and other issues). Most people do not want to have to deal and manage with their cryptos, especially if they own more than few and are entitled to airdrops, which is very time consuming to keep track of.
Crypto banks are the next logical step, problem with coinbaise is that they are not competent enough, not that centralized storage is bad.

Clearly your awareness and knowledge of what is going on with BTC is non existent. You even don't know how 51% works, why miners would do it and why its practical in right circumstances. We can argue whole day but from what I see you either have naive view of world or don't understand how hash rate is shared and between who at this moment.
@_date: 2018-11-04 22:41:04
If you want BTC you will only have to pay bank with fiat and convert it. Then a bank will keep BTC for you, of course to your discretion you will be able to move it to your own wallet, although it will no longer be secured or managed by them, you will be on your own.
Banks don't "just" create fiat, you watched too many zeitgeist movies. What I have said is not a FUD; since when existence of a crypto bank would be a FUD? You think people around the world are waiting to be their own bank? Also mining will always be only for people with technical knowledge, not for every day user.

I do. You just don't have answers for any difficult questions related to it, because of it I would say you are the one not really interested in it other than "lambo" and "be your own bank".
Questions like these, miners doing 51% and other that are swept under the rug are things that prevent adoption. Before they are answered no one serious will touch it.
@_date: 2018-11-04 21:40:28
You are delusional. Copying/checking address you want to pay to, managing hot/cold storage (unless you keep all btc in one place doing your "business"), having to be careful so your phone is not getting stolen/damaged/hacked, waiting for confirmations, setting fees for faster block time
Using btc is nothing but different from using cash. You understand that many people will be broke if being your own bank would mean managing all crypto from your device? Most population would not learn how properly use it as most people are not willing to learn about technology, they just want easiest interface available and go about their day.
Just because you sit, read and learn about blockchain tech, doesn't mean most people will (they won't in a matter of fact). Blockchain is not something that people need to jump on, that is why it has to be readily available to them in easiest and most secure way possible. Being your own bank is not achieving this at all. I know most of this stuff and I would use crypto bank as soon as it exists.

Adnreas is getting little bit out of touch with reality. Let's say someone somewhere came up with the best possible app on your phone, the most secured that can be, that allows you to process all your coins and send them anywhere to anyone who has access to at the same time.
You still have to take into consideration and worry about:
-public and private keys
-multiple wallets
-cold and hot storage
-hacks (nothing will ever be 100% secured)
-insured funds (it won't be insured since you are on your own without middle man)
-block times, congestion, fees
-cartelized mining pools (it's already an issue, and a big one for multiple coins)
-hardware requirements to sustain PoW (right now it's minuscule, it won't be when we talk about globalization)
-non reversibility in case of error, typo or mistake
All these while people have to worry about their lives, families, work, and still have time for hobbies and leisure. Currently the only entity solving all of the above is a middle man (called a bank or similar) that secures and insures these funds in case of fraud, hack or other, releasing it's owners from having to spend time on managing their crypto and go with their lives.
It would be like people having to store all their fiat home and send it/pay with it manually. Right now it's impossible, maybe in couple decades yes. My conclusion would be that crypto bank or crypto services from existing institutions are the next logical step.

BTC had segwit implemented even before Christmas pump where 18k usd bitcoin created pool with 30-50usd fees and up to a week long transfers. Only difference now is batching by most exchanges and more LN nodes. BTC still lacks technology to be free of delays and greedy miners, also LN by it's principle takes away decentralization, and looks like it will be used only for certain tasks and networks.
You sound like someone who read abut BTC yesterday and tries to be all knowing. Stop idolizing it, because while blockchain is novelty, is still full of obstacles and flaws.

Yes, updated with LN that is still in alpha phase with 2000 nodes (probably more than that now I admit), segwit is not used by everyone as well. And lately news about ebay accepting BTC with 3rd party, which defeats BTC purpose since it suppose to fight 3rd party payments.
I don't understand your paragraph about censorship, what coins are censored that BTC is superior to?
Don't get me wrong, I think BTC is novelty, first coin that I follow since 2009, but technology changes, and BTC should not be a staple coin, not in the form it is now. With LN and SegWit it becomes caricature of itself, since it's purpose was to be fully decentralized without exceptions. BTC should be let to prove itself and survive for it's merits, not because it's a main pair on every exchange.
@_date: 2018-11-05 12:49:46
I would say same to you.
"Not your keys not your coins", "be your own bank"
If you have family or any real life responsibilities then I am really surprised you are repeating these phrases. Most people barely have time to keep up with what they already have to do throughout the day. There was never a technology that masses were eager to be literate with, blockchain is no different. 
Give a choice to avarage person - manage your own crypto and spend time keeping up with all things related to it, or give option to put it in crypto bank where competent people will do it for you for a fee.
Which one you think will be chosen? I am talking about avarage human being that is not inclined with tech, that makes majority of population.

Well kids and hippies don't want it. Rest of the world is looking for safe and secure place to store coins that is insured in case of a hack.
You can dream of a world with truly decentralized currency, but it won't happen. People here are hypocrites about it, segwit and  LN are the opposite of decentralization. Banks will not go away, it's an entity that has always been around in one shape or form that stored and processed other's people money. Instead of fighting work with it.

Joe is very interested in crypto as far as I can tell. His current assistant (Jamie) is more tech savvy than last one (redban), so whenever blockchain comes up, he tries to explain it to Joe and tells him what is new in crypto world.

Gold is physical, that is I think an important feature. 
I know where you are coming from, I would not have any problems with your statements if we mine asteroids and gold is abundant. But it's scarce element on earth that has very interesting properties, and it's also valued, just because it's pretty.
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:40:34
Except we use gold for electronics so you can mine BTC.

That "o" should be changed to "d"
To be clear: I meant kryptokids. You all got rekt. But remember - don't get rekt.

Fused gold is radioactive and making it is really expensive, no rouge nation would ever be capable of doing that. You would have mining asteroids for gold first rather than fusing gold in bulk technology.
I am not trying to argue with you, it's just that some people do not value BTC as you do.

This is hilarious, whoever claimed it back then basically was forced to hold couple years, and now they get cash equivalent of what they had at that time with BTC still to be given back.
All in all everyone involved in mt gox that did not fail to make a claim is better off now then selling off back then, all by incompetence and dishonesty.
Isn't crypto wonderful? I mean, I wish all best to everyone involved, but don't fucking tank whole market with these shenanigans. If you don't want to be a billionaire, use these BTC to expand markets instead of destroying it. If these BTC are freely given back, most I assume Will be sold fucking up whole ecosystem.

You will only hear crickets or naive people who think that if needed Chinese government would not intervene and fork/manipulate blockchain. One dude told me "nothing would happen, they would immediately fork off".
Like no shit Sherlock

They will just switch to blockchain. Let's say btc becomes worldwide best mean of transferring money. What is stopping them from adding a btc layer to their already existing infrastructure?

You either still live with parents, smoked too much weed, stayed late gaming too many times or had head trauma in childhood.
You do understand that society you see now, progress, inventions, quality of life etc is mostly due to loans and banking system and finance management? Most big and small companies operate on system of loan and repayment, bigger ones also operate on dividends and returns. Most people could be born and raised because their parents had opportunity to get mortgage, loan on a car and significantly improve quality of life enabling raising a child.
I know it's hard pill to swallow but if you expect society to switch and operate fully on crypto to maintain all of the above you won't live that long I'm afraid, IF that ever happens (probably it will be mix of fiat and blockchain)
Even unbanked are smart enough not to use crypto as main payment system and they still will stick to hyperinflationary fiat or mobile credits.

Ok, so they will just lower fees to match competition since they will be on blockchain anyway making their transactions basically feeless. Difference will be they already have infrastructure and connections, huge base of customers who at the end do not care if their money is handled on blockchain or by normal settlement method, they still see and can use  their money instantly.
If not visa there will be another company like visa, only on blockchain (see bitpay).

coz muh blockchain

It is true, not "whether or not".
There isn't institution yet.

Thanks to chinese letting you.

Not everyone is so wealthy like you. Or you will blame victim now too? Some people take loans to actually invest it to better their life. You understand that people borrow money not to spend on hookers and coke, but to buy stuff that will pay off in future? I.e. vehicle to get to work to be  able to earn money, move to another state etc.
And it doesn't suck, it's just life of average people, obviously you are not average and you are above plebs, but most people who take loans have reason to do it.

Nerf the world eh? Can't do that, they already give participation trophies.
@_date: 2018-12-29 08:32:34
Well then there better be blockchain 2.0 in the making because we need to go deeper.
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:41:20
In technological era gold is irreplaceable for some uses, and so you can't give examples from thousands of years ago. People here say use cases for btc evolve, same for gold. Maybe in future gold will be even more useful for something that is not ready yet.
Gold was never shitty metal since it's intrinsic properties are fascinating (inert, does not oxidise, neutral and not harmful to human body, can be flattened to atoms thick layer with basic tools)

Buying kilo of coke

Reading comments like these I truly feel bad for unbanked, true victims and targets of btc maximalists.
