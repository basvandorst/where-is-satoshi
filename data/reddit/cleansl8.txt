Potato potaAtoe you care way too much about the discredit of a Important person...
Im not offended that you do not believe but it makes it hard to continue with next plan were running out of time. Can you follow and share let many people ask me if i am or am not...
Im sure lets start here I am Satoshi more than Craig Wright... if he tries to take it or anyone does. I just mailed a package to California with my name and a key on it... Good Luck decyphering it...

My family is fine being free... money is not freedom.. bitcoin is linked to money it was to redistribute wealth but now wall street has taken control...
So were still in a fight.... but worse because crypto does help evil in the sense of terrorists are able to move money with stealth and is not what was intended when I was reporting the idea to Cypher Punks in 2008
@_date: 2019-04-16 11:17:15
Your so sad that the real person is not who you thought... im sorry your harsh words dictate someone in addiction caused harm to you in your lifetime... im here to give you the information you never looked into the proof... and my friend went to princton and had perfect english 1600 in his SAT.... if you want to keep testing me keep asking questions but i will keep telling you your proof is simple... find a way to remove your anger and maybe you can see that i am not wasting my time and i am trying to proove that FELONS are just smart people that were not afraid to go beyond limitations... something that really makes me a good possible person that made the link.. i did nothing but forward old documents and msde revised info...

The real threat is Q Computers when BTC is not a safe bet.
By then bitcoin will be way different then what it is now. We will fix the markets in order to restore a safe fair world it requires people who have power distribute it to everyone again. It does not need to be socialism. It needs to be restored to begin world peace. If we keep fighting over money it wont end well.
There are bigger problems then money.
We need to fight raceism and anything that is going against humans learning the next stage

I am so glad there are so many fakes and one real one. :)
Took 10 years to reveal the real Satoshi.

@_date: 2018-11-15 14:18:33
The problem is wolfs on wallstreet are playing hardball shorting bitcoin in mass... flip is occuring by 24-72 hours if they hold there short positions longer than a day in my opinion only they will start to feel the squeeze... then you have craig wright who like to make false claims of being Satoshi...
1. Satoshi is not a person it is a movement. 
2. Bank is not evil only the people that controlled it were evil...
3. Fear on a mass scale was implemented to learn who is a threat in this world to freedom for everyone
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:44:51
why do you people have patience no ? Its a numbers game
If you would just stop listening to news and make your own educated decisions.
 Follow people who have earned trust and stop letting your emotions run your portfolio you would be fine stop checking every 4 mins what is happening and have trust or please sell this market is for women &amp; men more important Soldiers.

I have been working on my project.
I am trying to build a non-profit social support platform.
I am having the project setup with Anynmous Wallets.
I am working on a Governance protocol.
This will allow people to vote on opinions.
The top opinions will be selected by an algo.
These will be drafts...
Then, the top draft topics will be displayed in my platform.
The governance protocol will allow individual to provide their opinion anymonously.
The purpose of this protocol is so that no one individual bias occurs. (Money swayed opinions, politics or anything to sway an opinion with false data example (Smear campaigns only thing i could compare to)
This is so that individuals have their opinion stored to a LOCKED blockchain.
The purpose of this is so no government can hide accurate data or opinion on command after a community vote.
If 51% Majority favor unlock of data,
The answer will be revealed publicly in a feed.
(Picture Face_ ook  directed to public support rather then media blasts it would be to find a support group for your needs.
My platform in development is made in a way that allows you to create a profile and will allow you to view profiles of similar strenghs and weakness.
A support group should have people of all types to keep a solid support.
The feed will generate daily or hourly depending on how much people are voting on these topics.
Downside it require more time &amp; money since ICO in USA are not pretty i am unable to spend much more on my own. I have half of this vision finished.
Before i invest time money and work bring people onboard to help me.
I need to see the opinions
Im taking survey in my area.
I wont build this without knowing it is needed.
 to developand i need people willing to help...
I need some opinions on the idea.
I really think if this is developed with no profit involved we will create this in a way that allows governance to work for public with no political creed or anything involved swaying your opinion.
 NO INDIVIDUAL WILL KNOW WHO VOTED FOR WHAT. THEY WILL ONLY KNOW IF MAJORITY VOTE TO REVEAL DATA PUBLICLY.
This is very important to keep majority opinion inside our community.
It requires honesty to have accurate data.
But i think this could be important

We're gonna have a problem here
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dave said, nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dave's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love 
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Satoshi, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who, " "Yeah, but he's so cute though."
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes
I'm Slim Satoshi, yes I'm the real Satoshi
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Satoshi please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Satoshi, yes I'm the real Satosh
All you other Slim Satoshi are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Satoshi please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee."
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Satoshi, yes I'm the real Satosh
All you other Slim Satoshi are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Satoshi please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Satoshi, yes I'm the real Satoshi

I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: "How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Satoshi lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Satoshi, yes I'm the real Satoshi
All you other Slim Satoshi are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Satoshi please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Satoshi, yes I'm the real Satoshi

So won't the real Slim Satoshi please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Thus far this work of art is not mine i just hold the Key to it.
I need your help i may go down for this movement.
But i think this much power no one mam or gang dare fuck with me due to the nature of what i did they will be next on the chopping block...
So they leave me alone.
I made my own immunity with no wealth.
Only because i stole riches just to burn them down 
Now i relax everyday and am able to look st my BTC and be glad i still hold my own power.

What makes me worry is what is going on now. You have economy down. You have short positions of institutions trying to break the crypto market. The news around it is to keep it from taking over.
Fear is all they have to try and keep you from the truth.
I would learn and stop saying i wish i got in
I could have bought in 2010 i decided it would not be fair.
I did not understand how to code everything so i found people who knew about it in fourms.
I decided to make a fake yahoo account to join tge threads and expressed the idea aftwr stumbling over the psypher punk work.
I started buying bitcoin in 2017.
I felt like keeping everything hidden.
I barely remember this stuff at all.
But after years i realized i had the movement in mind.
You should follow your gut. If something feels off it IS.
Get your knowledge so you can get your positioning.
If your going to buy in this market you got to be ready.
Wolves held the pyrmid.
Paitroits hatched the Satoshi... 
Satoshi stood for...
YOSHI FROM MARIO (CHILD'S VIEW)
(SOUNDED LIKE CHINESE OR JAPANESE)
NAKA WAS JUST A MADE UP SOUND 
MOTO ( stood for Motorola) communication
You should really save your money buy into Bitcoin i  spent $100 a month into Bitcoin in 2017.
You got to hold positions 
Taking risk is hard.
It is easier to hold silver.
Just take your time...
Money is just Money...
Your time is more important...
Enjoy your life.
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:47:02
Im not trying to spread a swayed opinion i am simply trying to get the community to chime in on a thread on debate on what needs ro happen not what you think the price will be i dont care if BTC goes to 0 or Google....
But i do know together we can dilberate what will happen...
My opinion is we need to start a fresh debate on whats going on start a thread on where we are heading as a whole group not just a few opinions
@_date: 2018-11-07 15:07:36

If your trying to hide money Bitcoin is not it...
You need BTC and Privacy coins... thats about it...
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:07:12
You can follow the reason Bitcoin is so low is because you have the people pulling strings to accumulate over greed. It is position around their power to ma ipulate you
If you hold your hand all these weak holders will go so they can reset their snare...
There purposfully winding their spring
With futures sales of short postions + global concern for the threat crypto unregulated hold over their control instruments
It is likely the market will find a higher high.
Base is 5K the catalyst is your menal ability to seperate the white noise from the truth that Satoshi set.
I think after watching the market for 10 years it has evolved to a movement sustainable only for individuals that have an understanding of the power we stand free over banks now.
They will put the pensions stolen into this outlet they were forced to do so...
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:29:37

Well you can think whatever you like i really dont care.
I just thought you all should know why everything exists you can read my story here you can figure out how it is me. I have nothing to lose by being honest because even if they could proove it was/is me theres to much they cant do anything about it. I am sure you can believe I AM Satoshi over Mr. CRAIG WRIGHT...  and his failing effort to try and take bitcoin as his.
again i dont really care if you believe me my post was to inform not to do anything else.

@_date: 2018-11-16 22:27:47
No one is most likely will teach you the trade.
I have some knowledge if you ask direct questions i will help
The biggest threat to crypto is uneducated decisions.. peopme do not want to wait they expect to put their money in and take doue out in 5 days.
It does not work like that there are alot of things to go over in crypto. It is a hobby for me.
But i am armed with knowledge of the system on a basic level.
I took my time and found it interesting.
I still learn everyday.
Look you will make mistakes in trades and maybe send a transaction to wrong place it is tough.
I just took a year to learn everything i thought was needed to grasp the concepts.
I never really learned the code side of everything.
You don't need to know that to make it profitable.
No one will tell you the secret to get it right.
I can help some. Hope this helps.

I am currently working towards listing my coin on exchange i have messaged exchanges for about a year once a month i asked smaller exchanges you must pay fee for listing for most which i understand. But it is only as hard as you make it.
I am actually interested in what you guys think before i fork over more money to launch my platform. I am waiting to see where i should go.
Is it best to launch coin with exchange listing or should i wait to announce listing on first exchange...
It take time keep asking and its alot of leg work.

I disagree we need to fight against takeover of machine. Like Elon Musk says.
We are at the turning point.
Alexa can relate.
We need governance against supercomputers and their ability to force their A.I. will against human will.
The problem is magnetic field problem mind comtrol devices. And 5g.
This may make it not able to fix the problems... idk
But i do know how to get this to a grinding halt against the machine Vs man takeover
We are fucked
Unless we all donate to the cause to develop this governance platform.
1. It must stay Non profit
2. We only accept one amount donation to keep people from greed investment.
3. Anynomous must stay.
4. Governance owned by humans.
5. Power distributed equal.
6. Make upgrades.
7. Follow no leader of human type.
8. Launch the tool to remove this big issue of machine takeover.
9. We must never disclose the blueprint to anyone of negative means.
10. Evaluate pros and cons before making this tool real
11. Take survey to find msjority opinion of our tool.
12. Find a way to let this tool help even people who do not understand.

Your just mad you know that your not me.
Theres only one satoshi just like theres one eminem.
I thought you people would like to know who Satoshi is and what it means...
I really not kidding about my statements.
Ive faced criminal charges you really think im afraid to tell ugb the truth?
Go ahead ask anything you like
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:50:32
It did not go up your right.
But Bitcoin is still alive :)
It will go higher it had to head lower until people stop being scared.   Its what happens when people have no money and use their extra
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:48:05
Hello here a gain just to confirm a Block its again Satoshi :)
@_date: 2018-11-16 02:44:16

Sigh i wanted to launch ipo for my project.
There is so many scams though.
I have only 1 Advisor and i had everything coded at a premium
@_date: 2019-01-30 02:09:04
Yup still him
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:11:25
There is no best coin...
What are you trying to do with it?
Make money? Store or create wealth 
Careful what you wish for...
That much power is dangerous and the purpose is to unite everyone and level the playing field against peopke forcing their power over you.
If your trying to make a return just buy $250 in bitcoin because its a pain in the butt to make the buy... for the first time its not worth it for a return anytime soon unless you are shorting the market which is not really beginner level...
If your going to buy Bitcoin you commit to hold it.
Or fees will take money moving it back and forth...
Alot can go wrong...
More problems and adapting is needed ..
Also find yourself using Teather or something...
I would just trade small until you learn...

Sorry you all can not be Satoshi but you can use my coin.
@_date: 2019-01-04 22:20:42
You have people like Craig Wright trying to take ownership over it prob just to see who really is him.

Im pretty sure everything i have said makes sense...
I understand you prone to trolls and your own "it can't be" mental state. . . Would it kill you to think your actually communicating with HIM?
I really understsnd your argument...
I can get why your resistant to think for a second that i am not him...
Okay im going to look for the closest Blockchain convention i will go on stage and announce myself...
I will wear a bulletproof vest and will immedeatly run... 
 
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:45:05

But in reality i really am telling you the truth
@_date: 2019-01-04 22:11:05
At the half epoch and or once the regulations are in place OR once fear of political agenda is no longer  phases us
It will recover after macfee eats a dick is also a possible boost cause everyone wants to see him eat his dick plus idk if you have not seen it lately it is already going up now as well...
Seriously why is a prediction all youh want?
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:59:02
To answer your question about punctuation this was over 10 years ago. I was fresh in school then... im not in school think how you txt ppl im msging you from a fone.
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:03:22
I was the first of its kind.
That is why it is 
It is important because it give you control.
There are downsides to it also like everything
Power consumption
Scale up
It is sad the people who hold the most to lose. Banks and wealthy golf business men/woman
Figure out the right information.
It only holds value because it is being used.
It had solid fundementals and represents a threat to the governments of the world
It will always be shunned
But its been here for 10 years
Has not went to 0 aint gunna
They woukd have to turn the power off globally and destroy the internet.
If that happens well that day may happen
It is more likely they would surrender before they tried that...
Instead they are doing exactly what their doing now....
Spread Fear on TV
Not impose regulations... 
Instiutions manipulate the truth in silver gold and bitcoin actual prices due to large sums of money in a global attempt to shake out everyone.
Even the death of Bitcoin would not win them the fight.
Happy Thanksgiving
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:54:46
Yup been 5+ years thanks man
@_date: 2019-01-04 22:14:21

@_date: 2018-11-14 17:44:19
Let it be flagged its to promote the truth
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:47:36
I dare you to look into my truth... i can assure you that i have made the first cryotocurrency that is Bitcoin...
What purpose do i have to lie? Is it just not comfortable to think theres someone created Bitcoin... you really think its Craig Wright? I can tell you even what computer i used
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:02:15

I know what i have done in my life.
Im waiting for a legitimate argument. 
Proove that i am not him?
Ill post everyday saying i am who i say i am
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:59:04
I have a question is there a way to turn bitcoin into something that does not require power use? I am concerned no one is resolving that problem...
And i am worried about the control China holds over bitcoin.
We will have no Bitcoin if they decide attack double spending.
China could be very well be able to pull the rug. 
Feel like they already did...
They are not going to implode bitcoin though because it will make them weaker...
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:25:28
Sorry ill deleate
@_date: 2018-11-16 02:32:09
:) ill be here :)
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:13:28
Thank you please check out the next 24 hours markets are out of this world 
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:35:38
Okay i am BULLISH long term
In the meantime,
It is not foolish to average
I am hard headed and do not like to short Bitcoin
But because of how many are shorts.
If you can not bear tge money go down add a position 
Just don't like pulling trigger to somthing i do not want to go down. But since i am forced in the position i am in right now i am left no alternative.
Make my job easy.
Due to how the market going below 6k we are in for a turn dow. To 5k i do not think Bitcoin can stay down. Near 3,500-5,000 range longer than the new year. This should spike down.
I was incorrect about my statement yesterday.
     It is going to take aprox 30 days for this market spike so Thanksgiving would be nice.
Given how much i know myself struggle with a child/ xmas and money being at a squander it is likely the Chinese New Year will spark money into this market again...
