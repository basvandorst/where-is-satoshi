I read upload should increase to about 200 GB a month, and I'm not worried about that. Download should be less, maybe a 50 GB a month (1/4)? Not worried about that either. If it becomes a problem I'll adjust to keep the full node on 24/7.

If not: I had about 20 BTC in Multibit when it was no longer supported. If you still have the wallet on your computer, I know you can move your Multibit wallet to Electrum:

That means you are just observing and not actually validating and sending along transactions or broadcasting blocks to the network. 
I am not that tech savvy with bitcoin but I was able to set up the FULL node by following these steps:

Network effect. Limited commodity. The greatest invention since the internet. Can topple banks and service the 6 billion underbanked.

Awesome! Our full nodes were born on the same day :)
