I do it almost weekly via bank transfer. No issues....yet.

All 3 still unclaimed from what I can tell.  Is that a correct assumption?

Who is this goober?  He looks like Peewee Herman’s aborted brother.

This isn’t meant to sound racist but.....(how a typical ‘white guy’ starts a reply when he’s going to be EXACTLY that)....all I could think about when seeing him was “I think he misunderstands the dangers Blockchain poses to Visa.   We’re not talking about HI-b’s asshole. “. (I know.....different use of the word Visa)

Great question.  Although if I was not a “typical white guy”, I might go with something a bit more biting. Perhaps something along the lines of,”asshole, pale faced, melatonin-lacking, colonialist”.

Would you also begrudge the temps they set their ac and heaters at?  How about the food they eat?  Have you seen living quarters for most single soldiers?  They are pretty sparse and tiny.  How about if someone uses a computer in their barracks room to do web design?  You pay for that electricity, also?  And college classes taught on base?  Yup....the lights in the college classrooms powered by electricity are also coming out of your tax dollars, for the chance that a servicemember might get out of the service, assuming he or she is still alive after they have completed their service, and make a little bit more money than they did as a grunt.  I understand where you’re coming from. But don’t begrudge someone who is standing up for your rights and putting their lives on the line on a daily basis.

In that case, he’s as unethical as fuck. Let them know you have his name and he will be contacting Jag, and his base, and also his post commander. See if that doesn’t light a fire under his ass.

Well, we already went through the “If you want blood, you got it” phase in crypto.  I’m hoping the next phase is “TNT....dynamite!”

Here is the commander’s hotline: 208-828-1362. 
The number to their on base JAG (military lawyers) is 208-828-2238.  They may not be able to help you directly, but they may be able to give you information on how to go about settling this kind of issue. They don’t want to bad Publis city and they don’t want bad service members giving it their unit or base a bad day either. It doesn’t hurt to remind them of that.

This is clearly a fake one....I can tell because if you enlarge it by going to a really high quality and expensive print store, you will see a tiny imperfection on the flip side of the minted coin.   Although, that imperfection could make it very collectible to true Bitcoin enthusiasts.  You might have one of the most sought-after, non-consensus Bitcoins in existence.   Probably best to take it to a coin shop and get it appraised.  Now.....if you had a real Bitconnect, you could retire and never worry about money again.

Man, that takes me back.  Let’s hope crypto ends up better than Bon Scot did.
