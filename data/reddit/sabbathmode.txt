Oh so jaded and edgy.
It's may not be *inherently* wrong, unless you believe in Santa Clause or whatever, but it's wrong by any commonly accepted ethical standard. You're hurting everyone that relies on that system and undermining the trust upon which society is built, all in order to enrich yourself. If you believe that *anything* is wrong, you'd have to do a lot of mental gymnastics to say that that's not.
Also "people have been doing it forever" is not a useful argument. Let's try substituting something else and see how it holds up:


Checkmate, UN Human Rights Council...

Why would you even keep asking? I don't see you volunteering any personal information. If it's that important to you, feel free to creep through my comment history and piece it together yourself.

**You** said that it's not wrong, and I submit that it is. That indeed has little to do with the fact that people will do it anyway, but your statement was, again, that it's not wrong. It's nobody's fault but yours if you start a debate without knowing how to articulate your own position.
Also, this accomplishes nothing:




People who are genuinely knowledgeable do not waste time talking like this. Get over yourself and say something useful.

There you go. Rather than building an echo-chamber out of social networks like most people, you can just make a smaller internet where you NEVER have to deal with those pesky dissenting opinions.
Also, what's the point of connecting to trusted neighbors at all? Just go talk to them.

I didn't say don't gamble. Not all bets are equal. Also the opportunity cost of missing the boat is not the same as losing your shirt.

I'll never understand you people who buy in right in the middle of these big rises. Do you really want to bet on accurately predicting where a bubble will peak or where it will settle afterwards? Because those things are pretty hard to predict. Why not just wait for this wave to pass and catch the right side of the next one?
I guess you're the ones fueling my profits though, so thanks for that.

You guess. When the price drops, buy. When it rises, sell. I really don't think I'm proposing anything new here...

So apparently Ghana is doing alright compared to the rest of sub-Saharan Africa...
