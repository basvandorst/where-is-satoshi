The crypto scam accounts are ones that have been bought en masse or hacked. They're not part of "cryptotwitter" in any definable way until they begin spamming.

So even if "cryptotwitter" is smaller than r/bitcoin then it's irrelevant.

Can you explain why the size of "crypotwitter" has anything to do with how easy it is to moderate? Considering the accounts spamming scams have had nothing to do with "cryptotwitter" prior?
Also there have been what, 25 posts in 6 hours on this sub? With about as many comments? Searching "bitcoin" in twitter gives 140+ tweets in the last hour. That's just bitcoin, not anything else. "cryptotwitter" is way, way bigger than r/bitcoin.
