What about MasterCoin and ColoredCoin(s)? Once these ideas crystalize the altcoin explosion will drive value back to the blockchain instead of competing w/ it.
It seems that we are only at the beginning of defining the abstractions which will make bitcoin appeal to the masses.

I can confirm that in my experience a trial period is common in startup land. After all it makes sense to make sure that you're a good team fit before bringing you on officially.
However I would say that it **is not** common to work for cheap during that period. If anything you won't be getting stock options and/or benefits during that period but if any company (coinbase and apple included) asks you to work for cheap or less than you think you're worth than turn and walk the other way as quickly as possible.
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:24:40
Yes I agree. I just think I just kinda feel sad for people who only see the speculative potential w/ btc and miss the here and now of it.
Bitcoin is happening RIGHT NOW. There is no reason to wait until it's worth $100K a coin to appreciate it's **true** values.
Just assume that the speculative explosion is over and move about your day using bitcoin. Appreciate that we have a currency/property which is fluid/digital/trans-national and not backed (read manipulated) by any third parties.
I always think there are two types of people—those that think wealth is something you get and then sit on and those which think wealth is something you continuously create.
If you're a part of the second group then you're out there today building the kick-ass bitcoin companies and services of tomorrow which will in turn make you plenty of bitcoin. You don't need to depend on sitting on it until it goes to $100K a coin because you'll have made that much from your work so it works out the same.

I didn't imply that you would. And after purchasing 30 GHS (so far...) myself I can agree w/ you 100% that you won't see the return in mined coins.

I've been wondering how will colored coins/mastercoin etc affect volatility? 
As higher level abstractions get built which drive ever more value to the blockchain will it spike volatility or will it spread out liquidity?
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:02:59
Solid answer. Thank you.
Yea in a way I agree with you that things may have got over-hyped too quickly. Perhaps if things had a few more years to happen before the governments were aware of it.
And yes it appears that some early adopters of bitcoin were nefarious types who took the community many times over.
Regarding dogecoin—yes surprisingly it does appear to be taking off way more than I anticipated when first hearing about it. Though honestly I think it's fulfilling the destiny of litecoin—to be the silver to bitcoin's gold (though that's a stretched analogy of course).
We have still yet to see how the mastercoin/coloredcoin(s) movements affect things. If what they say is true then in the future altcoins will drive value back to the blockchain which will cause btc to be even more valuable (SuperUser help me I'm sounding like a speculator).

Coinbase provides an amazing service w/ their online wallets. It's incredibly convenient to be able
to access your coins from any number of devices with simple web access and it's very valuable to have
your bitcoin wallet connected with your bank account for when you want to buy/sell coins.
Also Coinbase has better security hygiene than most people have with their personal home network and
PCs such as
* [Stores 97% of coins in cold storage](
* [Two Factor Auth]( for signing in and for sending btc
* [Granular per-app permissions]( for how much an app can send and more.
That being said I still advocate that people store the bulk of their bitcoin in offline cold storage
which **they and only they** control the private keys for.
The most important thing IMO is offering a user the choice to handle the storage and management of
their own coins or to outsource that responsibility to someone else. As long as the user is
consenting and trusts the 3rd party to manage the coins I don't see a problem with this at all.
There is always the chance that the 3rd party will take your coins and run. That is absolutely a problem.
And until there is some form of regulation (and FWIW I'm not arguing that I'd like regulation)
there is really no protection for a bitcoin user who stores their coins with a 3rd party so in
that sense it definitely makes sense to store the bulk of your wealth in wallets which you ultimately

Congrats! Welcome to the community! :-]
I originally found out about Bitcoin in 2011 on [hacker news]( I soon got my first coins from [Gavin Andresen]( at the [original bitcoin faucet](
Gavin Andresen is the current lead developer on the bitcoin project and back in 2010 he bought 10,000 bitcoin for $50 and gave them all away on that site. Back in the very beginning he was giving away 5 at a time. As you can imagine many people played around with the technology and made their first bitcoin transactions w/ coins given to them via Gavin and his amazing bitcoin faucet.
Bitcoin is perhaps the most exciting and revolutionary technology to come about since the web. It's very early and there is still basically endless opportunity as a software dev or business owner to come up with an idea and scale it out across the whole network.
I wish you the best of luck on your bitcoin journey. Just remember that if you truly believe in Bitcoin then all of these market fluctuations won't faze you. In fact you'll begin to view these types of events as good for the network because it shakes off weak/dumb/scared investors and offers a chance to pick up some coins at a discount rate.
But ultimately don't become obsessed with the price. In one very real way it matters because bitcoin is a way to facilitate an exchange and if the value of a bitcoin compared to the value of a dollar is down then it affects your purchasing power in a very real way.
At the same time if you consider bitcoin to be extremely undervalued at the $600-$800 range then you won't mind spending/sharing it.
With that in mind let me share one more bit of advice regarding spending bitcoin.
One way that the Bitcoin network gains value is as more and more transactions are happening every day. However many people feel incentivized to save their bitcoin because the deflationary model of the currency means that (most likely) your bitcoin(s) will be worth more in the future.
The way that I've found to get around this is to continue to get coins which I'm saving. Always get them into a state where you feel comfortable about their security like a paper wallet or a good web wallet w/ [two factor authentication](
Now on top of that anytime you need to make a purchase and it's possible to make that purchase using bitcoins then purchase the bitcoins at that moment from your favorite exchange and then use them to pay for your item.
This way you can both securely save some bitcoin(s) for the chance that they will appreciate in value while at the same time being able to more and more pay for things using bitcoin.
Again, congrats and welcome the community! :-]

Regarding volatility I like what Andreas says—Bitcoin's marketcap is currently around 5.5bil. This is at best a small nation. 
Think of it like a small kiddie pool—there just isn't much liquidity.
Whenever a large player makes a move it sloshes noticeably across the pool. As the marketcap/size grows so will the liquidity pool which will cause the volatility to go down.

It's my personal project. It currently has 3 parts:
1. Social Philanthropy
2. Blockchain Explorer
3. Consulting
 Social Philanthropy
I think that in the next year it'll be come increasingly more common to tip people w/ btc and altcoins. We see that daily here on reddit of course.
I'm hoping to wrap the blockchain in a webservice and release an API which allows devs to easily drop btc/altcoin tipping/donation functionality into their apps.
 Blockchain Explorer
This is the code which I'm open sourcing the first part of today. It pulls down data from coinbase, blockchain.info, and blockr.io.
I intend to add rails generators which will generate the views and QR codes as well.
 Consulting
This is pretty self explanatory—helping people integrate bitcoin payments and such into their existing applications or building things from scratch of course.

I disagree and think that QR codes are actually one of the more user friendly solutions.
Completely anecdotal but I have a 5 year old son and he has become obsessed w/ QR codes. He calls me over and has me scan everyone that he sees (of course this could backfire one day).
I imagine him and his friends growing up a world where QR codes are completely second nature. Of course it may take a few years to cycle out the non digital natives but the time will arrive.

And that's a crypto future that I too can see potentially happening. In fact I would say that FedCoin/YenCoin etc really will be one of the bigger threats that btc faces. Especially now that the IRS rulings make it so cumbersome to track all your btc transactions.
if there was a FedCoin which was legal tender and had instant confirmation and no/low transactions fees as well as being backed by an FDIC sure I can see 'regular consumers' (though I don't like to over-generalize) liking that more.

What about off blockchain, zero confirmations, no fee transactions like between two coinbase accounts?
I have a site gitcoin.co (honestly not trying to plug it. only using it as an example) and we allow people to give donations to charities using bitcoin and people give microtransactions all the time with no problems.
Perhaps referring to off blockchain transactions isn't in the spirit of the initial comment so doesn't really count but I still thought it worth mentioning that you can use bitcoin to very effectively send microtransactions.

I experienced 3 similar such transactions of a single satoshi coming to my wallet on coinbase as well.
They each came from a vanity address which started with '1sochi...' and they arrived over the course of about 12 hours.

I agree that paper wallets are confusing but keep in mind that most people probably won't use paper wallets.
Once multi-sig becomes the norm it should be much harder for large exchanges to get cleaned out of funds in single hacks.
This and regulation as well as larger financial insurance agencies will give regular people the faith they need to just use a service like coinbase.
Also keep in mind that QR codes really aren't that challenging to grasp.

Unless you're one of the tulip mania freaks you absolutely wish that you could be buying more right now and if you bought any yesterday/last week you're pissed that you didn't wait.
**I** certainly wish that I had more money to pick up coins right now. I completely agree that the momentum and awareness surrounding bitcoin has grown immensely since the Dec spike.
As an interesting side note I currently have a client to which I agreed to do some work for a set amount of bitcoins over time. I figured that either one of us could take a bath if the price spiked/crashed but I thought it would be cool to just do a large project for a BTC value instead of obsessing over the fiat value.
The client recently emailed me saying:


Granted that is just a gentleman's agreement and there aren't much specifics but this person has tipped me extra bitcoins in the past so I trust their word.
I'm guessing that people who have set up Bitpay's Payroll API [0] are feeling stoked as well.

I got my first 5.05 btc for free from the original bitcoin faucet back in 2010/2011 and I've bought as high as $950 and everywhere in between.
I spend bitcoin daily on goods and services (ghs, piperwallet, cold storage equipment, donations, overstock etc) as well as giving plenty of people online wallets and/or cold storage to get them started on their btc journey.
Sure I could have 'hodled' every coin that's ever passed through one of my wallets and I would have far more btc than I currently have but I like to tell myself  a) I'm helping the bitcoin economy and community grow by spending/sharing and b) I'm actually getting to know what it feels like to live w/ bitcoin.
Currently 1/2 of my income is paid to me in btc the other half in fiat.
Of course we'd all like to become wealthy by speculating on btc but perhaps (not guaranteed) those days have passed. Even if btc never goes back above $500 and even if the new US tax laws slow down people adopting btc as a currency it has clearly shown it's value to me and I will be using it more as more as my primary currency as situations present themselves.

Not a bad idea. But if someone finds them and I get hassled it will of course suck.

Hello!  is the best place that I know of to get cold storage coins although they no longer come preloaded w/ btc.
You can however still find them preloaded at auction.
They still sell the aluminum coins (I ordered 500 yesterday) that you can print a sticker and put on the back though admittedly that's not exactly what you're asking for.
Another great option is the  I am also waiting for that to arrive in the mail this week but I've heard many great things about it. Though once again this is in paper storage which isn't exactly what you asked for.
Welcome to btc! :-]

Indeed and your odds might be better. :)

Care to explain? I like to think that we were all originally miners (I ran to original mining software on my macbook pro in 2011).
Mining is the creation, validation, and securing of the network. Merge-mining is what makes the alt-coin community so vibrant and what protects many alt-coins from large 51% attacks (if I understand correctly. Please correct me if I'm wrong)
I don't think it's critical to the bitcoin experience but in the same way that Alan Kay said 'People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware' perhaps people who are really serious about bitcoin eventually get into mining?
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:41:20
First it's not apparent to me that bitcoin is a pile of shit and I think there are plenty who agree. 
Second, as I said above knowledge gained through actual experience (Empirical Research) is the ultimate and most credible source of knowledge.
With that being said no I wouldn't smear shit all over my face either.
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:43:21
I see what you did there.

I actually find it incredibly interesting which casascius coins are unspent and the breakdown of the denominations.

To be fair we don't really know if he/she/they have been mining/trading/selling coins as another alias all along. 
He/she/they could have been making and spending plenty of btc all along and just not have touched any of the initial blocks that we attribute to Satoshi.

I think that many people who hate on are people who heard about bitcoin early on (-$1–$100) and didn't get in.
I myself got 5 coins for free back in 2011 and then it fell off my radar.
Last year as the price surged I felt genuine regret at not having recognized the potential of bitcoin and acting sooner.
Of course I never came onto and hated on the currency but I can very much remember that feeling of 'damn I missed something HUGE.'
What finally turned it around was realizing that I wasn't around for the .com boom either yet I'm a 100% digital native web developer now.
The web defines my life and my friendships in a very real way now and I realized that I had been aware of bitcoin since the beginning. Sure I may not have become rich off of speculation but I had a real love for the underlying technology.
That's when I realized that I was indeed a bitcoiner, started moving some of my savings into btc and decided to come on full time last year.

Yea I'm thinking I'll use the aluminum for small time cold storage to hand out to friends/family and for promotional material for gitcoin.
Larger/long-term cold storage will be going into the p(i|a)per wallets

Well with a username like that I guess it's hard to argue w/ you. You've clearly thought this out.
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:29:55
I would say that you are missing part of the experience by not mining. Take $10 in btc and buy some cloud hashing at cex.io. 
Just something that simple gives a better understanding of merge-mining, the difficulty rate, how often blocks are mined, etc.
At least it did for me.

You didn't answer my question. Have you ever owned or used any btc? If not then how can you speak so authoritatively?

Yes I am still thinking about it. I don't believe that anyone has proven without a doubt if Dorian is or is not Satoshi.

I think that services like the one I'm building gitcoin.co (not a plug just making a point) which allow you to remove the cryptic addresses and just send btc to someone's profile help in this direction.
Also QR codes are incredibly UI friendly to smartphone carrying digital natives.
Multi-sig and cloud/always-on backups of wallets will also help Joe Public gain trust in the crypto-space (admittedly maybe not btc but some other altcoin)
@_date: 2014-03-29 16:12:34
Sites like the one I'm building (honestly not a plug—just making a point) gitcoin.co can allow you to just make a donation to a person's profile. You ultimately don't need to know their address at all.
Admittedly this opens up two problems:
1. It remove anonymity from the situation
2. It requires you to authorize the website to remove funds from your wallet
Of course most of us wouldn't potentially allow either of those to happen but for 'mass adoption' I don't see those people caring about remaining anonymous.
And once multi-sig becomes the norm it will be somewhat safer to trust some institutions to be able to remove coins from your wallet on your behalf.

It doesn't seem like a global agreement would hold sway over something like the Bitcoin Network would it?
I was imagining a scenario where someone wants to create a new meme-coin and the moment that they announce it on hacker news the difficulty shoots through the roof and someone else owns the coin.
If that is even a possible scenario what would be the solution? To have a pool of miners ready to go out of the gate?
