@_date: 2017-12-11 05:48:27
Naw paid about $95 in transfer fees it looks like from the transaction log.  I checked it just now to find out lol!
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:09:08
I did, I had multiple wallets over the years.  Bought a rig at one point with 4x Radeon 7970s to do shared pool mining.  I stopped using this particular RAID array before I got heavily into Bitcoin.  It was my first time using the software and I forgot about it.  Swapped the RAID 0 array out for an SSD and left the drives alone for years.  Never checked that array, but I did check the SSD multiple times LOL
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:28:58
Lets go get a DNA test! No problem if you are my kid!
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:29:50
Did you pee your pants? Have you stopped sounding like an asshole talking about money? Who has asked for a “loan”? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:34:39
I do understand the jealousy ....every time I read one of these stories I kicked myself in the ass!
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:31:26

@_date: 2017-12-11 16:20:10

@_date: 2017-12-11 16:29:48

Aside from my dad I called my cousin who is a CPA/lawyer and my accountant and was like "so...." ... No federal-rape-me-in-the-ass prison for me :)  Years of running a small business and dealing with payroll taxes taught me that :)  Thank you for the heads up on Net Investment Income Tax.

@_date: 2017-12-11 16:22:19
To be honest... I don't quote remember or know why the 5 extra came in... it was defiantly a 50 BTC reward though at the time.  Also I updated the post with a signed message from the 50 BTC addres so.... should be good!
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:32:25
Been selling them on GDAX over the last couple of days with maker orders... I think I figured out like $95 in transfer fees to get it to gdax.
