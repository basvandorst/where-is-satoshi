Pretty sure the beer &amp; its little tray are hanging from the ceiling. The thing attached to him is just a collection of limp cords.

Worst bot ever ;)

Hey that's a good one

Link to a case where a virus has made its way out of a VM?
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:55:02
Hey, he said he would suffer the inconvenience. I guess if that involves jail time, well..
@_date: 2014-05-28 02:49:43
Uhh are you okay? You kinda jus

It greatly reduces the amount of control a bank has. It makes it more difficult for them to manage/control loans, which are typically a bank's main income.
There are probably some other reasons that I can't think of off the top of my head.

That is not a link.

@_date: 2015-01-16 00:26:41
In fact, not with any attitude!
@_date: 2012-09-12 02:59:04
I would like it a lot.
@_date: 2012-09-08 16:54:02
Where would I buy something like this?
@_date: 2012-10-23 00:50:00
Huh, thanks. TIL.
@_date: 2012-08-18 04:20:15
bubble is pop?
@_date: 2015-02-07 00:53:17
But we changed it to "bird", and I wore an onion in my belt, because that was the style at the time.
@_date: 2015-02-07 00:56:02
and those who weren't expecting a ternary joke!

Better than dropping it on the ground for someone to step on, or putting it in your pocket and getting poked by it.

You think people will be able to buy a non-piece-of-shit house with a single Bitcoin within a year or two? Do you even economy?
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:55:28
You're an awesome friend, and good for the Bitcoin community. Nobody ever pays me in Bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-10-10 17:46:57
So condescending. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:45:59
Not for long :(
@_date: 2013-05-27 00:17:39
I like the overall look, but the colour scheme needs work. Particularly, the green text in the top left and the grey buttons in the bottom right don't seem to fit with the rest of the page.

Which free country?

"Fuck you, bitch! Get away from my babies!"
@_date: 2013-02-24 18:23:19
I think that Bitcoins will continue to be successful in the future, but I'm not foolish enough to expect to be able to purchase a decent house for 1 BTC within the next 2 years.
Tell me, how is that spreading FUD, you arrogant prick?
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:13:46
And then what do the raspberry Pis do with it?

Obviously. But the question is: What could drive people to sell it en-masse?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:10:58
Two spaces and an enter  
is enough for a single line break :)
@_date: 2013-02-26 17:54:52
Hmm, for such a long post, it's interesting that you managed to completely avoid the question "What exactly did *you* innovate?". 
@_date: 2013-02-24 23:15:58


What exactly did you innovate?
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:10:25
I was going to sell this morning, but I thought: "Eh, I don't have a Mt. Gox account yet... It'll probably take too long to open one and sell before class. Oh well."
Oh well :(
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:54:14
Oh damn, I thought you said you bought $150-worth at $3.
@_date: 2013-07-13 20:23:37
With an expert witness.
