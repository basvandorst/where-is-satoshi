Don't all companies have a right to refuse to do business with whomever they please?  It's a free market, if you don't agree take your business elsewhere.  Why does botcoin need to solve the problem and force a business owner to do something they feel is morally reprehensible?

Nope, usually the credit card company will detect the fraud right away and halt it.  During 20 years of credit card use, I've only every had three unauthorized charges, and each of the times the CC company called me and asked if those were valid charges.

So isn't forcing all all you honest customers to use bitcoin instead of their current credit cards a huge inconvenience?  Do you currently  accept bitcoin?  
@_date: 2014-07-31 03:10:10
Which is why I use dirty fiat.  Where is the benefit to using btc over something already in place?
@_date: 2014-11-08 04:21:29
So you have to convert your bitcoins to a gift card whose value is based off of fiat.  Brilliant.  
By this logic, I can spend bitcoins anywhere, take bitcoins and convert to fiat, then spend fiat(from converted bitcoins) at any retailer.
