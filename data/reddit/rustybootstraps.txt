bch is completely illegitimate due to the minority fork and the consequent dicking with the difficulty algorithm/EDA quagmire.
It's still arguable whether it's possible to have a legitimate hard fork, but if it were to be possible, it would at least require hashrate/node/economic consensus-- and mustn't undermine the difficulty algorithm to survive.

@_date: 2018-01-23 02:24:02


emphasis mine--
Bitcoin has operated under several hypothetical vulnerabilities it's entire existence. The threat of DOS or reorganization is multifaceted, and this model has never been fully proven secure in perpetuity.
 In the times of overtly high hashrate mining pools, there was a concern of doublespends and reorgs-- the ability for state actors to covertly acquire attack capable mining hardware and unleash it unexpectedly is always a theoretical concern.
No doubt is it problematic for these hypothetical attack vectors to exist, however the security, including game-theoretic security of Bitcoin has so far proven to provide a secure blockchain and will remain hypothetically capable of doing so until some actor successfully executes a dos or reorg.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:12:06
The majority of the time in fact. Bitcoin also typically passes many times more transactions per block (even in the rare cases when it has smaller blocks), and orders of magnitude more economic value transfer.

I hope they don't release it before all edge cases are ironed out and the software is very near perfect. A flawed release is worse than a slow release. Alts have to move fast and break things to get an edge on Bitcoin, but Bitcoin's (and it's ecosystem incl. LN) don't have this luxury. Bitcoin and friends need to be rock solid to fulfill their primary objective.

Any altcoin can be built on top of Bitcoin unless they are trying to compete with Bitcoin mining's security.
Alt tokens can be created by burning Bitcoins and blocks can be mined by including op-returns in transactions. Any consensus protocol can evolve given these basics.
Any alt which does this inherits the security and immutability of Bitcoin, yet can have arbitrary block validation logic and it's own p2p info relay layer.

Proof of work is incomprehensible without a consensus protocol to guide it. Simply burning energy, or making sha2 hashes is pointless as it's the protocol which decides _how it can be done to create value_
proof of work ties digital information to the expenditure of physical energy--the protocol specifies what this work is, and how it is to be done to be considered valid:
The sun burns a lot of energy, and does a lot of work: is it Bitcoin? 
It is possible to DOS attack Bitcoin by expending energy, either by nuking all the miners or by stealing their hashes to do non-bitcoin work-- but that doesn't make the atom bomb or the hash thief Bitcoin.
What if Bitcoin's price crashed during the gpu mining epoch, and everyone went back to playing video games?
Would video games have magically "become" bitcoin just because the graphics card owners/miners felt skyrim hours played were more valuable than mining Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:01:26
Bitcoin's primary value proposition is deflationary currency-- cheap transactions _on chain_ are a nice to have, and we will see more project use the security and favorable economic properties of bitcoin to anchor value systems and payment networks on top of Bitcoin in ways which make these favorable properties accessible to more people (like LN does) but imho, every new payment system scheme _does not need it's own token!_ This is the folly of altcoins, imho-- if similar investment of development effort was put into developing sidechains and merge-mined solutions, the cryptospace would experience unseen levels of synergy instead of the contention we see between tokens today. See: again, LTC/DOGE merge mine as a primitive example of what would be possible if people would stop investing in ICO's and scam tokens trying to look at every problem as a nail when they hold only the hammer of POW/POS/mined tokens. Bitcoin has already solved the problem of deflation and immutability-- why does every altcoin need to reinvent this wheel when you can leverage the entire POW force of Bitcoin to anchor entire currencies of various properties for the psaltry expense of a Bitcoin transaction... while at the same time _increasing_ the security of our shared immutable ledger?

The presence of an attacker capable of reorganizing Bitcoin clearly undermines the level of confidence we might have in the security of the current ledger, but it could just as easily be demonstrated a number of ways, mining blocks being unnecessary for doing so. and does not make the data structure demonstrating the presence of attack-capable hashpower somehow become Bitcoin.

Which rules? Which rules do you think are important to the protocol? Which rules can be ignored when determining how much acceptable work has been done?
Obviously, if you don't accept the sun's work, you must favor some hash algorithm, presumably sha2... But that's one rule of the protocol... How do you decide how to evaluate that work? do you use some sort of a block structure? If so, how do you define that block structure? These are all aspects of the protocol which must be followed to generate meaningful work. If you can;t produce meaningful work under these rules (eg you are the sun and don't know about sha2, or if you are Bitmain, and don't know how to follow the difficulty adjustment rules) your work is meaningless and invalid in the context of Bitcoin. just like bcash.


Nonsense... The protocol underlying chain consensus is precisely the tool we use to evaluate what constitutes work.

A finite number. Indeed... But increasing defacto transaction throughput by a few orders of magnitude won't hurt will it? If we were running even 100 transactions through a channel once created... We have done quite well. Better than some competing cryptocurrencies could ever dream to support on chain.
It would seem to me that people might only open channels monthly or yearly... So we could conceivably be amplifying the utility of an on-chain transaction by a thousandfold.
So if we manage to saturate LN, I'd call it a champagne problem. Might have to start using Schnorr/Coinjoin transactions to open channels to get another order of magnitude... but shit... If we get there, I'll be on a private island and probably not care at all.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:59:04
I'd also like to clarify that I never assumed any rate of channel maintenance, but rather, per-channel-lifespan throughput estimate (1000 tx/channel), and did all calculations in raw TPS units, again given the postulate:
n_users = transactionCapacity * transactionDemand / user
n_users ~ transactionCapacity

It's a bug in clients which doesn't properly enforce the consensus rule that a utxo can only be spent once in a block. A bug in verification logic apparently only checked that the utxo was available to spend in prior to the block in which it was spent. The old node implementations would straight up crash if this type of invalid block was encountered, but a subtle logic bug fixed the crashing, but didn't fix the verification logic.
The bug would have allowed funds to be doublespent on what is essentially a hardforked chain in the event of a chainsplit. The bug allowed the hard fork condition to be permitted by some clients. Those who don't (older, and the newest) would not have validated the block, while some newish (not newest, the bug is fixed now) versions of the Core client would have not noticed the consensus violation: If blocks continued to be mined on top of this otherwise invalid, yet accepted by some buggy clients, block... a chain split would occur... on one side of which... again... some UTXOs could be spent twice in the same block.

n_users = transactionCapacity * transactionDemand / user
n_users ~ transactionCapacity
Ok now that's out of the way, we just need to figure out the transaction capacity under various conditions:
5 TPS now
10 TPS high Segwit use  (note, we can support an upper limit of double the users with segwit, which is barely used today because of low demand, evidently-- so arguably segwit isn't even saturated yet)
----LN Assumptions---
1000 transactions per channel lifespan
2 transactions channel create/teardown
60% network LN footprint (pure speculation, could be higher, could be lower, who knows--especially given segwit isn't even saturated yet)
so we get:
(0.6_utilization * 10TP/S * 0.5_(LN chan/tx)*1000(transactions/ channel)) + (0.4_non_utilization * 10TPS) = 3004TPS )
3000 additional LN transactions at these assumptions plus the 4 on chain transactions left over after the LN transactions are used.
So divide that, 3004 by our current TPS of around 5 and you get a userbase supportable growth factor of... drumroll... about 600!
We can grow 600X because of this technology. No, that's not everyone on earth, but it's 600X more performance than we get today.
If you care about price, depending on whether you believe today's price reflects today's userbase, and depending on whether or not you believe in metcalfe's law, we could see Bitcoin prices of:
(PriceToday * growthFactor)^metcalfe
= ($15000/Bitcoin * 600)^1  (no metcalfe) = $9000000/Bitcoin Full segwit, Full LN utilization
or (If you are a metcalfe optimist)
= ($15000/Bitcoin * 600)^2  (full metcalfe) = $8 X10^13/Bitcoin Full segwit, Full LN utilization
**I'd say I'd smile if we can saturate LN and Segwit.**
If you think Bitcoin is overvalued speculatively by a factor of 10 (new money, I guess) we have to downrevise our estimate assuming worst-case scenario...
= ($1500/Bitcoin * 600)^1  (no metcalfe) = $900000/Bitcoin Full segwit, Full LN utilization
or (If you are a metcalfe optimist)
= ($1500/Bitcoin * 600)^2  (full metcalfe) = $8 X10^11/Bitcoin Full segwit, Full LN utilization
**I'd still smile.**

This, but consensus mechanism aside (it can be forked) the tech appears to be working.

except that it isn't irrelevant... It may just not be the silver bullet that instantly gets us to global capacity in it's simplest conceptualization. (Though my guess is that we ain't seen nothing yet in terms of layer 2 technology and research)
There's no denying that LN will be able to add a huge factor of utility to on-chain transactions, and boost network utility in turn. Bitcoin can do much more with LN and layer 2 than it can without.
This is absolutely an improvement to Bitcoin, which should boost value immensely. (Value's relation to price is another question)

It gives people their blockchain coffee in a most elegant manner.
It will increase the capacity of the Bitcoin network to process transactions, and thus, increase the size of the supportable userbase/demand.

If all you want is a wallet, "online" shouldn't be necessary. Luckily, it is easy to run Bitcoin wallet software yourself (not hosted online, but rather as a client, which can be run over Tor), and there are many good options available with varying degrees of technicality. Exodus, I believe, is a very straightforward wallet--but many still use the Bitcoin reference client, as it has proven and trusted quality and security.

Most likely trying to hand the network over to bitmain with a green bow. Block latency increases only help the majority hasher... which is clearly bitmain today. But yeah, keep focusing on storage since your lemmings can't find the brain cells to rub together to see that block latency and initial sync are real issues affecting the security of the network.

very sloppily:
\- Roughly, if Bitcoin has used, on average over it's 10 year history, 1/10 the power consumed annually as it does now (64TWh), we'll round and say it has used 50TWh in it's lifetime. (anyone who has a better figure for this?)
E = lifetime energy usage
E = 50TWh = 3.6 x 10\^15 Joules = 3.6 x 10\^15 kg\*m\^2/s\^2
and a familiar E = Mc\^2...
3.6\*10^15 kg\*m^2 /s^2 = Mc^2
3.6\*10^15 kg\*m^2 /s^2 /c^2 = M
and c = 3\*10^8 m/s
M = 3.6\*10^15 kg\*m^2 /s^2 /(3\*10^8 m/s)^2
M = 3.6\*10^15 kg/(3\*10^8 )^2
M = about 40g for all of bitcoin mined to date, about 18M...
M = 2.2\*10^-6 g per bitcoin, 2.2 micrograms

The comments in this thread remind me we have been in Bitcoin eternal September for like 2 years now. Shitcoins must die. They have no reason to exist except to pump and dump, dilute the value of Bitcoin, and enrich their founders. Bitcoin has given us the immutable ledger: it can be the basis of any functionality we need. Other blockchains-- other tokens-- other shitcoin networks: all garbage, and if we can't collectively realize this: we have lost, and the bankers have won. Without scarcity, cryptotokens are just another junk bond in an infinite soup of shit. A potentially infinite number of shitcoins breaks scarcity. There can only be one.
Even now, their agents infiltrate our communities. Even now, the seeds of doubt are sown. The only way we can lose, is by diluting our value. By softening our minds and losing sight of the goal: to murder the banking establishment.

What a load. First of all. There is nothing inherently "wrong" with chain re-organizations. What the recent episode in bcash demonstrated is that a miner cartel has the hashrate to 51% attack the chain: something which is still hypothetically impossible (economically) in Bitcoin. Bcash has centralized infrastructure and insecure mining dynamics.
UASF was completely different: it was a soft fork signaling new consensus rules, which, as it goes for softforks, was adopted because it was economically beneficial to those who adopted it. I really fail to see any similarity at all.

The only party which has any say whatsoever in the direction of the development are the people who pay fees and buy bitcoins to subsidize the hash rate.
If "Core" acts against the will of the true consensus, nobody will run their client. In reality, because of this, the core client follows consensus, and I feel the current process (including soft-fork favor for upgrades, I can't understate this) does a good job of discovering the virtuous path and reflecting the will of the economic community, which align in theory. If this wasn't the case, another implementation (there are many Bitcoin implementations, although many of them are less popular, and they are sometimes of inferior quality) would attract deployments and developers.
I have mixed feelings about multiple clients (Satoshi was against them)-- I agree that a single point of failure within a single, widely-deployed client could be disruptive to the network, but at the same time, failover to a different implementation would be easy to do, and in most cases, would be backward compatible, that is to say the damage from running a broken client is probably reversible in some cases. (this is one of the benefits of having easily-synced nodes). I \_don't\_ think it's a good status quo to have multiple incompatible consensus interpretations to be competing on the live network, but using soft-fork consensus almost completely avoids this problem. Ideally, though it's good to have recourse in case developers don't align with community (see BIP148), consensus/roadmap will be vetted before implementation and deployment, and I feel this is largely the case now.

\&gt;When blocks aren't full Bitcoin transactions go through at 0 sat/byte so  yea it wouldn't really be an issue. I'm talking about BTC too, the way  it was for many years until the new devs took over and the blocks got  full.
This statement gives away the difference between well-reasoned thought and your self-proclaimed "common sense"
1. "Devs" never "took over", except that much of the community support the direction the decentralized development is taking, which must be the case of course in Bitcoin.
2. If all transactions go through at 0sat/byte, bitcoin is unsustainable, stating this as some sort of a goal is absurd. You prove by assumptions implicit in your statements that blocks MUST be full for bitcoin to be stable in the near future (halvening and beyond).

Use the search bar.
spv wallets are not trustless. you have to validate your transactions to actually be using bitcoins primary feature.
That by far the majority of LN users nowadays use custodial wallets is \~a fact\~ a speculation, and  that some people chose to use custodial solutions is ultimately irrelevant. some people use spv wallets too. They can do what they want, but they're not participating as peers in bitcoin. I have a non-custodial mobile lightning wallet for small transactions (eclair) and it just works. 
miner revenue due to fees is a feature, not a bug. and those fee levels were a clear outlier on the tx volume-fee curve.
whether or not it will scale to an infinite number of users is irrelevant in light of the fact that ln will exponentially increase the utility of Bitcoin. It's already quite usable, and transacting with "hubs" of any size or organizational property is optional for a user. Anyone can run a routing node.

I would expect that the ideal state of development would be a large, revolving group of loosely-affiliated individuals, with ever-increasing skill and talent. A large number of old-school experts, in both the philosophical and committing classes are still present and active.  Others have left the project as new contributors are willing to do the dirty work, or because they are unable to keep up to speed on emerging research which is happening at an ever-increasing pace. Satoshi, in name, is obviously gone, and others have left for various reasons, but we get new devs at a fairly regular pace. It is impossible and undesirable to consume only the products of the "original devs" (satoshi). If you're referring to Gavin, Hearn and Garzik, you'll find that their departures from the community were largely mutual.
re: point A) I was just basing that on what you actually said. Ultimately, say what you will about where \_you\_ think fees should be, but realize that with Bitcoin running at steady state, blocks will be full, or miner-constrained at some point less than infinity ("When blocks aren't full Bitcoin transactions go through at 0 sat/byte"), and average fees will be non-zero regardless of block size. This is obviously a complex issue, but I think anyone who is intellectually honest in this conversation must accept at least this.

bitmain has been mining bcash at an apparent loss by using covert asicboost which they previously had a monopoly on... Now that other miners can compete on an even playing field, bitmain loses it's homefield advantage on bcash... decreasing incentive to mine to in the first place.
With the primary advantage to bcash being removed (allowing bitmain to recover asicboost lost potential) the chain will probably languish, and the incentive for bitmain to attack bitcoin by hashrate reallocation to bcash disappears... which might have been one of the remaining reasons to invest in the token...

A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace
by John Perry Barlow
Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.
We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.
Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.
You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions.
You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract. This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our world is different.
Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.
We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.
We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.
Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here.
Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.
In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams must now be born anew in us.
You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.
In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.
Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.
These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.
We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.

as detailed elsewhere extensively, segwit allows us to move certain parts of the transaction data to an external data structure, so it depends on what types of transactions are being used, but 2x I think would be a best-case. Segwit also allows more transaction types, including, down the road, things like MAST and Schnorr, not to mention LN, so really it provides many thousands of times the utility, though not in the traditional sense of one-in, one-out transactions.

You still don't get it: There is no "sensible" way to hard fork the rules, such as a block size increase. Once precedent is made to allow social convention to override the protocol, the initiative is lost. Bitcoin's primary advantage is that it is immune to the whims of the mob.
It's still the case that if someone wants a coin where the points are made up and the rules don't matter, they can buy ethereum, and probably already have. It has better tps for the moment anyway- and proven poor security. For some use-cases: this is adequate. A "big block" Bitcoin has no purpose whatsoever.

I am of the belief that Bitcoin can be modified, in ways, by a true hard fork which concludes in the termination of mining on the original branch--as has arguably happened in the past, or could conceivably happen in the future only in cases when the original protocol has a terminal technical flaw: An example of this would be the breaking of elliptic curve cryptography.
I also believe the hypothetical case in which the protocol is broken from an incentive standpoint could be another possible mechanic, but to me, this invalidates the project of cryptocurrency and falsifies the hypothesis of robust digital money until significant technological or mathematical advances occur.

if you look at the hashrate percentage chart, what I said is true. BCH was pulling down 10% pretty reliably, and 12% before that... on average timespans of months. Reliably, lately more like 7-8% (on 7-day average, which is reasonably long to smooth out variance.) look at the chart. Variance is real, however, this change is not coincidental: BCH has been significantly less profitable to mine lately due to it's price decline, and hashrate is adjusting to match.
Perhaps I wasn't clear that I meant hashrate share % to Bitcoin--that could explain your confusion. Yes, BCH hasn't sloughed off that much (albeit some) gross hashrate; Bitcoin's has grown consistently.

This is incredibly dangerous in the presence of hostile miners who stand to only centralize further--and further undermine the interests of the network, under extreme block size growth.

It is no more possible than it is for Verge to "become" Bitcoin... 
The ledgers have diverged. The POW rules are different. BCH can NEVER become Bitcoin, even if Bitcoin somehow ceases to be mined.

the left y axis looks like the UTXO distribution: a slice of the plot reads like a stacked histogram with the color encoding the age of the utxo cohorts in the distribution. The y axis value corresponds to the ratio of the utxos at that age.
So, we can see that in early 2013, for instance, about 50% of utxos were older than 18-24 months.
The right y axis is the price to be compared against the black price trace. the x axis is obviously time.

It's just that maidsafe actually has a scalable data storage roadmap. I'd imagine that if you really needed to store every shitpost in your blockchain forever you would just be storing the hash of the db and publishing the db in encrypted form via a real data service. I guess when all you have is a simplistic view of blockchain technology--everything looks like a nail.

There is no such thing as "THE mempool" every node has it's own mempool, and they can vary greatly between one-another, containing completely different transactions based on network location and configuration.

Hey,  I just wanted to jump in here to echo the notion that there appears to be strong consensus that a block size increase on the base chain is \_not\_ worth the incremental scaling benefit in light of the risks to the network re: splitting, decentralization and philosophical virtue per the risks of hard forks in a supposedly immutable protocol.
I want to add, that again, LN is way better than most realize, I've opened channels that persisted many months (and still rocking) and have closed hundreds of nearly-free payments, providing me a very good amortization of the the on-chain transaction which opened the channel.
I also want to add something which many of the other posters have not mentioned, which is the possibility of other higher-order protocols with different tradeoffs from LN, which generally are less appealing than LN because, again LN is friggin awesome, but still cover valid edge-cases which are still important. (LN on-boarding (for lack of a better term) for instance)
You should be aware of the existence of sidechain research, extblock proposals, and other similar non-hardfork ways of addressing these edge cases. These are infinitely more likely to gain transaction in the community than a block size hard fork. If you \_really\_ care about non-LN-covered edge-cases, there is active work being done which is less-well-known/discussed less, because LN steals the limelight, again because it's friggin awesome.
Also read up on channel factories, and some of the work being done on the boundary between on-chain and off-chain. This is a broad community, which has largely rejected hard forks for good reasons, but this doesn't mean the edge-cases you care about are being ignored. Better solutions will be found with more appealing tradeoffs than "throwing more hardware at the problem". Even if it takes a while, Bitcoin is less "move fast and break things" than "do it once, do it right". The damage of a block size hf would last forever, while the scale relief would be rapidly consumed and forgotten.

sidechains probably. sidechains+LN = unstoppable. Just need to figure out the peg/correct economic model for them. LN gets all the attention for now, for good reason.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:32:02
being opt-in, I can't see how this is an issue. if there are 100 sidechains, and somebody uses the one they like, we have made an optimization.

the value of bitcoin transactions will increase as the network grows strong enough to clear trillions in fiat. fee percentages around 1.5% have been fairly stable throughout the history of bitcoin. There is no theoretical limit to the amount of value which can be placed in a single transaction as long as the mining ecosystem is strong enough to secure it.

I'd like to agree, except that the fact the various bcashes have been allowed to exist for so long sort of undermines faith in some of satoshi's economic assumptions re:mining. 51% attacks on small coins seems not economically viable, but given that it's rarely profitable for miners to attack them, and the ease of starting these hashrate-trivial forks, were likely to eventually see some sort of pareto-hashrate, pareto-market inflation on coins which share hash algorithms.

Maybe I should be more optimistic, but I maintain that LN, while a great solution for what it can do, will not be able to match all use-cases of the various blockchains. For these cases, it's nice to have stopgaps which don;t require alt-tokens like regular alt coins. People with lower security needs could be well-served by a sidechain which caters to their use-case. the fact that sidechains are less-secure than bitcoin is a feature, not a bug.

switch ip address to a crypto signature and youre getting closer, however, there are lots of ways to lock up bitcoin, and lots of transaction types which look nothing like this... I think what you described is most like a p2pk transaction. "It's an older script, sir, but it still checks out"
"I would like to lock up one bitcoin which can be unlocked by the key of the person I am sending to. (fancy john hancock signature which nobody can forge, which is different for every transaction)"

hey, no problem. this is a highly-politicized issue, so it's difficult to get clearly-worded information.
I would highly recommend booting up your own node. This will be an amazing learning experience: you will learn all about the various configurations/setup/learn what it actually feels like to run a node (It feels great).
In short, re: your question, nodes have a few functions on the p2p network, one of them is relaying transactions. When you want to make a transaction, your node first creates the transaction data, signs it, then hands it to one of your peer nodes: somebody else running a node on the bitcoin network. they have the option of passing along your transaction. There is no way for the protocol to make them pass your transaction around. There are a variety of reasons they wouldn't: Fee too low (node operators can configure the minimum fees attached to transactions for their node to relay to stop spam), computer crashed, bad network connection, etc. This process continues until, ideally, your transaction is handed to a mining node which will mine the next block, including your transaction.
The topology of the p2p network will determine which nodes will see your transaction. It's nearly impossible to predict how your transaction will transit the network, but it is a highly researched idea in bitcoin (see: block propagation latency) The point is that the p2p network is not really part of the protocol. At some point in the future, we could change how this works, and still be running Bitcoin: It's not relevant to consensus \_how\_ a miner gets it's transactions.
Nodes have different configuration settings directly affecting their mempools which can, in addition to p2p network propagation, produce differences in mempools between nodes, like max age/TTL, node peer whitelists/blacklists/ the above-mentioned fee threshold.
The key takeaway point is that the mempool and p2p network are not parts of Bitcoin consensus: they are auxiliary things which can vary from implementation to implementation/configuration to configuration. Consensus happens only in blocks. This is where the rules of Bitcoin are verified. In blocks. There is no rule, for instance, that says a transaction must transit the network in less than a minute, or that all nodes must acknowledge a signed transaction before it can be included in a block. Or that nodes must remember every transaction they have ever seen for a day or a week or whatever.
I'll add that this process is related to the concept of database consistency, which is a highly researched field. Bitcoin achieves referential integrity by using blocks as the synchronization mechanism. [ see also, CAP theorem.
