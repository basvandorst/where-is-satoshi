As I've repeatedly said I'm willing to eat some of the cost, especially if it's low. However, these dinky 2 GH/s USB miners seem to be poorly designed and operate at their thermal limits while being almost of no utility to the network. Burning 0.6 kW (and spending some 100 EUR/month on juice) is quite out of question.

I've got three root servers running Debian wheezy which I planned to install bitcoind a while ago. I keep putting it off because there is no standard repository (so I'd have to build from source everytime there's a security update) and there is no standard initscript.
Would the Bitcoin community solve this adding full nodes would be a breeze.

I was slow to embrace Bitcoin because it requires so much data and opsec discipline, and significant assets can be lost by a minor slipup.
Now I'm reasonably IT-savy, it must be much harder for normal consumers. The centralized services are exacerbating the problem: now you're relying on them to not screw up.
Legacy banks should be offering Bitcoin accounts, based on professionally managed services. In fact, by using Bitcoin internally for interbank transfers they can skip the need to connect to SWIFT. In latter case worst-case loss would be low, as only a fraction of total assets would be in transfer at a given time.

Android is a Linux distro. If Windows and OS X become fascist app store shops who ban Bitcoin (though its user base is global, with wildly varying regulation) it seems that that they're removing an incentive for people to buy a Windows or Apple system.
@_date: 2014-04-03 09:41:38
I don't know what apps are, I use programs. And I don't need a store for them.
For mobile OSes like Android there's always sideloading. As for iOS, nazis are doomed, anyway.
So, no, you cannot destroy Bitcoin without disrupting the protocol, which will then likely then just migrate to darknets (obfsproxy &amp; Co).

Subject: Dear Respected One,
Dear Respected One,
Permit me to inform you of my desire of going into business relationship with you. I got your contact from the International web site directory. I prayed over it and selected your name among other names due to it's esteeming nature and the recommendations given to me as a reputable and trust worthy person I can do business with and by the recommendations I must not hesitate to confide in you for this simple and sincere business.
I am Wumi Abdul; the only Daughter of late Mr and Mrs George Abdul. My father was a very wealthy cocoa merchant in Abidjan,the economic capital of Ivory Coast before he was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their outing to discus on a business deal. When my mother died on the 21st October 1984, my father took me and my younger brother HASSAN special because we are motherless. Before the death of my father on 30th June 2008 in a private hospital here in Abidjan. He secretly called me on his bedside and told me that he has a sum of 12.500.000 BTC (Twelve Million, five hundred thousand bitcoins) left in a secure wallet.
He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth and some huge amount of bitcoins his business associates supposed to balance his from the deal they had that he was poisoned by his business associates, that I should seek for a God fearing foreign partner in a country of my choice where I will transfer these bitcoins and use it for investment purpose, (such as real estate management).
Sadly, he died while he was telling me the public key that matches the account, so some advance funding will be required to crack the remaining 43 bits of the private key. Sir, we are honourably seeking your assistance in the following ways.
1) To provide a bitcoin address where these bitcoins will be transferred to once the key recovery is complete.
2) To serve as the guardian of this since I am a girl of 16 years.
3) To provide an advance of 1.000 BTC (One thousand bitcoins) to be used to purchase computers that will be used to search for the remainder of the private key.
Moreover Sir, we are willing to offer you 15% of the sum as compensation for effort input after the successful recovery and transfer of this fund to your designate account. please feel free to contact ,me via this bitcoin address 1N8ZXx2cuMzqBYSK72X4DAy1UdDbZQNPLf
Anticipating to hear from you soon.
Thanks and God Bless.

I first became aware of Bitcoin on Jan 8 2009 due to this announcement 
I was not impressed because the name had no prior history (unlike people with prior digicash work like Chaum, or just long-time cryptography@ list members) and the developer released Windows-only binaries and was not responsive to queries e.g.  so I never ran a node while mining was still possible on commodity hardware. I don't think I've ever mined a single coin.
Just as well, as I would have likely lost the wallet anyway in the sequence of server moves with ad-hoc backups via rsync.
You needed to be unreasonable to believe that that thing would take off, unlike many similar projects prior. So I have no regrets in hindsight.

I have no idea how quickly the situation unravels.
I've visited a local hydro plant last week that's been in constant operation for a century. It powered the regional train that took me there within one hour. It is basically still has all the original parts but for consumables/serviceables (turbines, generators), and is in perfect working order. The original design and planning is so well done it basically can't be improved upon by modern engineering.
I see no reason why it shouldn't be able to continue operation for another century as is, barring precipitation shifts.
So I have no idea. If I had fuck-you-money I would retire to a self-reliant farm, and do remote paid work and otherwise tinker around in a workshop/lab.

The issue is of code governance. We have lost the option of a benevolent dictator when Satoshi left the helm. The result was quite predictable: as soon as a group is in control, no one is in control. Free market governance is also not one, since tragedy of the commons mode sets in.
So improvements to an originally imperfect/incomplete design happen in a big ball of mud modus, which could well result in the death of an ecosystem, with emergence of a successor alternative which addresses the original design flaws.

Feel free to come down from your high horse. I don't give a shit, personally.


Wow, you are really a piece of work.


Satoshi released a functional but fundamentally flawed product into the wild, and faded into the background. He could have remained anonymous but in control of the released code. Some of the flaws could have been fixed in the process. Then, he could have walked off into the sunset.

You don't need exchanges to use BTC to BTC transactions. 
If all exchanges were be shut down BTC will plummet in value, but not to zero. It will come back when the underlying economy has recovered.

Bitcoin should not have been released to the general public without a robust P2P blockchain distribution as well as resistance to mining pool centralization and a hash that was ASIC-resistance (large-block random memory access bandwidth).
Or at least Satoshi should have remained in control of the source code and introduced above features later on.
The reason why Bitcoin is broken is because its governance model is broken.

So I'm buying a notebook now, and splurge on 1 TByte SSD for it. It doesn't matter what the storage price curve is, I'm going to use that notebook for the next 5 years, or so. So losing 10% now doesn't matter so much, but what about 50% a couple years later?
@_date: 2016-09-22 14:41:22


So you're losing 10% today, what about over the course of next 5 years? What about larger blocks and higher transaction rate?


Sharding over P2P would have been a better approach. This would also reduce bandwidth demands.

Important: make architecture cheap to run, make it scale to large transaction volume, see Dan Kaminsky's analysis. In general, see where BTC has weaknesses, and try to engineer your system without these.
It would be nice to have linear growth, allowing for unlimited volume. Subexponential growth is more tricky.

I think Satoshi did remarkably well for a first design.
However, random access memory bandwidth is not something that scales with Moore (which is now over, anyway) or is ASICable. Even TSV die stacking only gives you a small boost, and it would be still COTS and hence accessible for every miner.
Of course there is no real cryptohash which is based on few-GByte LUTs. So that would be sufficient reason why Satoshi did not use it.
I also don't think he anticipated pools, or even GPU/FPGA and then ASIC miners. It was an experiment that succeeded beyond his wildest imaginations, probably.

Store a few usb sticks with encrypted copies of wallet.dat off-location with friends or family. Make sure to store the password separate if you don't trust them. For minimal friction, e.g. I would give your S.O. an unencrypted wallet.dat and store it in a physically safe location. Along with instructions, or how to contact people who could help loading the wallet and cashing it out, if required.
In general, I would try to run the latest code from  and keep your main wallet offline. Perhaps, running Windows is also not the best idea, but convenience is king.
If you want to help a network by running a full node I would suggest renting a colo machine with enough storage. Do not store significant amount of BTC there, it's just there to help the network.

Bitcoin isn't deflationary, just limited. A much better match for steady-state or contracting economy.
@_date: 2015-10-20 13:05:49
Well, the total eventual amount is limited but mining still continues. Of course, some funds are also lost, so that might slow down net rate mining, or even cause an effective monetary contraction.
Of course, the velocity of BTC is currently nil, since everybody is hodling.

Economics is not a science (more accurately: where it is a science it doesn't apply to the real world, and where it applies to the real world it is not a science) -- economists are just apologists for the current political order.

Generation is different from confirmation.
When you're mining you're maxing out your CPU to brute-force hashes, when you're confirming you're merely verifying the requests.
The result is that you can run bitcoind on an Atom without breaking a sweat if you're just confirming.
EDIT: I might be mistaken, due to the thread 
So if I'm just running bitcoind without mining I'm not adding any value to the network?

Mining = creation of new units of currency by brute-forcing a crypto hash problem. CPU and energy-intensive to the point of requiring dedicated hardware.
Ledger = logging transactions, and responding to requests. Not CPU-intensive, I/O-intensive and needs network throughput.
Latter can happen without new mining activity.

It does inhibit accessibility. The ideal solution for every government is to push transactions in Bitcoin into illegality, so that most users would be too afraid to use it. Transactions in cash are a loophole, but you might notice crackdown on cash in the last years, for pretty much the same reasons.
At least transactions in Bitcoin are difficult to track. We should make sure that there is a lot of them in circulation.
