It's not the goverment, it's the finance sector.

Your nick looks Polish, if You ineed are search google for an exchange with the word "abu" in the name. They verified me overnight and have an account in BOŚ bank. I use them for 6 months now.

1. HW wallet is a device which stores Your private keys inside it in a way they're never exposed to the outside world. Private key is a 'password' that enables access to Your funds. Once You make a transaction, only the transaction data leaves the HW wallet, but not the private keys.
2. Coinbase is ok, IRS is interested in them though.

Went in at 200$, boy was that late... Imagine that there are like 10m people using BTC now. Now lets imagine there will be 100m by the end of 2018...

Eventually SegWit and Lightning Network will kick in and fees will go down.

I'm from Poland and I can tell You this: if central bank officials try to steer You away of something it's even more attractive. The FUD campaign is even worse, since they have paid shills commenting under articles related to crytpo. It's funny that a goverment institution is paying a private PR company to spread FUD. But I can tell You that it has zero effect. We Poles have a healthy distance to any gov officials. It has been inherited from our parents and grandparents who lived under German and Russian occupations. For them goverment = trouble.
It has it's down side, we tend to avoid taxation on larger scale then other nations in EU (but there are worse nations by that criterium) but generaly we don not trust our goverment a lot.
Oh, one more important thing: this campaign is not issued by the goverment, rather by the finacial industry representatives. There's a new goverment in place since two years now and it's new prime minister (M. Morawiecki) is all about new technologies and innovations, so the law makers are at least neutral now and expected to be positive about crypto in general.
The general rule is that crypto is not outlawed by the gov and there just several disputes about taxation: crypto in the whole EU is non-VAT-able, but Poland struggles to settle income tax rules.
Crytpo owners head count is estimated to be around 40k in Poland and raising, we have several operating exchanges with AML compliance. Our turnover in crypto is big enough to be noticed by coinmarketcap in BTC/PLN pair.
Price of BTC vs. PLN is in the middle between all noticable BTC vs. fiat pairs:
Bottom line: not to worry, we will not be the banksters tool, we're too smart for that.

Don't ever sell all of Your bitcoin. Never. Leave 10-20% at least.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:32:58
Oh, one more thing: don't store any significant amount on an exchange: they can get hacked, banned, shutdown due to high traffic. It's a risk.

True, however it is the first bip word totaly outside the arc and fits grammaticaly.
I'm not even close to insisting I'm right about it. But it does fit right now.

I think that once you enter the phrase in a segwit compatible wallet you should immediatly see the funds. Thus the derivation path is not complex. At least thats my theory.
Once I have some time on my hands I'll download sources of some wallet to see the initial address derivation. 
I'm pretty sure that the puzzle uses the first one:
 m/49'/0'/0'/0/0

Yes, once I quit trying to resolve it myself, I'm far out though.

The idea is that he did not gave us actual pairs in the clues.
Almost open would mean you should almost reach the word "open"

There are exactly 24 bip words inside the half circle like this:
They are:
    find
    define
    provide
    try
    post
    attack
    old
    help
    early
    easily
    online
    almost
    entire
    order
    else
    proof
    way
    fee
    now
    sign
    tail
    gap
    code
    law
If someone can spend time getting them into meaningful pairs I can run my brute force checker on them, it takes around 12h for 12 pairs.
Edit: the brute force checker I've put together is checking every order of the pairs (12! checks), validates if they're are a valid bip mnemonic phrase and derives the following addresses:
m/49'/0'/0'/0/0 through to m/49'/0'/0'/0/19 and m/49'/0'/0'/0/257

"It's not a sprint, it's a marathon" - I think once You've got the answer it is still not complete, and You have to brute-force it a little bit to the end, try a couple houndred combinations.
For that occasion I wrote a small piece of code using these:
Sheer bruteforce is not an option though: 
pick 24 elements out of 117, order matters:

BIP141 may be not so widely supported. But I'll check.

Actually not entirely true, KNF paid a company called Gamellon to make a FUD campaign. They in turn paid three Youtubers:

Old news, but true.
Just recently the Polish Financial Supervision Authority ("KNF") put some crypto exchanges into a "warning" list, source: 
My exchange is on that list :D Apparently KNF filed a notification of committing a crime to the prosecutor's office because the exchanges provided an unlicensed payment service, which is untrue I believe.

Maybe "safe-heaven" wasn't the most proper phrase, let's go with "assets".

So what is Your idea of the next event that will have a big bullish impact on the price? I'm thinking something in the line: the financial crysis of 2018. Poeple getting out of stocks in panic, moving to ~~safe-heaven~~ assets like gold or bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:53:00
There's more. KNF (goverment financial authority) put two crypto exchanges into warning list of fradulent companies. Also filed a formal complaint to the prosecutors office.
My exchange is on that list. Apperently becuase of unlicensed payment services they provide. Not that I noticed, just Your every day crypto exchange.
