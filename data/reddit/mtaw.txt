So, it seems like you've more or less figured out the following:
- Small but nonzero inflation is good for the overall economy, as it stimulates people to spend or invest their money rather than just sit on it (as that'll lead to them losing wealth).
- Increasing the money supply with a large number of transactions (i.e. a booming economy), will risk runaway inflation. (and although not stated there's also the reverse, that decreasing the money supply in a weak economy will worsen stagnation)
- So you propose stabilizing the economy by decreasing the money supply during booms and increasing it during busts, by having a money creation rate (tax rate) inversely proportional to what's essentially the GDP.
This is all good and true, but you're basically rediscovering some basic macroeconomics here. What you're describing is essentially what central banks do, except they do it more indirectly by changing their interest rate. This works as it affects the interest rates banks charge, and thus the amount loans they make and thus money they create. So one problem here is that however you distribute the money (negative sales taxes, loans, [helicopters]( and whatnot), only changing the government/authority/whoever's money creation rate won't affect money creation through banks.

Yes: Tether won't exchange them for dollars and their TOS explicitly says they don't guarantee in any way that they'd be redeemable for dollars. If you have no guarantee of exchanging them for dollars, they're not backed by the dollar in any meaningful way.
And that's regardless of whether they have a reserve or not. But they don't. Believing that they're accumulating $100 million _a day_ in cash reserves to match the Tether they've been printing without any evidence is just absurd.

This kind of behavior isn't as strange or uncommon as you might think (I've seen it multiple times before). There are a number of psychiatric conditions that often cause people to have delusions of grandeur and make exaggerated and often fraudulent claims about themselves - such as narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder and hypomania. 
Having these conditions doesn't mean you can't be smart or know stuff, and despite being smart (although not the geniuses they'd have you believe) their lies aren't necessarily that convincing. It's not like your ordinary fraudster who might invent a merit or two and stick to that story, these guys are always coming up with new merits and new ways to impress you. It's not premeditated, it's not about padding their CV to gain a long-term advantage, it's about satisfying an immediate psychological need. Namely to have people recognize them for being the special unique individual they think that they are. (Which in the case of the borderline or narcissist is masking a pathologically weak sense of self, where how others see them is all they are)

Well, it does confirm the very low opinion I'd formed of the university in question. So it's a 6 week course where the first lab is doing multithreading (which I'd expect people to know before becoming a postgrad) but also by letting the compiler do it.. how does that even teach anything other than how to use that compiler directive? The last lab they're running some trivial OpenMP demos? 
I'm guessing the students aren't going to walk away from that course knowing more involved things like load-balancing algorithms or some such, as you'd probably do at master's level course in this at a real uni. Hey but the lecture notes told us what load-balancing _is_, so that's obviously some postgrad level stuff right there?

Video footage of an SSH session to _something_. Short of doing an actual calculation at a speed that'd require a supercomputer, you could never really prove a machine is a supercomputer remotely.

[Nation-state]( A form of political organization under which a relatively homogeneous people inhabits a sovereign state; _especially_ :  a state containing one as opposed to several nationalities.
Japan is a nation-state, the USA is not. Why you think that has anything to do with anything, I do not know.

Repeatedly stating your belief doesn't make it any less of a belief, which you clearly haven't backed with any actual rationale.

Not running a full node is in my rational self interest.

Boise represented Gore in the infamous [Bush v Gore]( recount case and the DOJ in US v Microsoft, and recently represented Harvey Weinstein v Women of Hollywood. They’re a famous firm. 
That’s some expensive council to retain for a ’sham lawsuit’.

No, where did you get that from? You have to have to go to a US embassy abroad, go through interviews (a process that spans months often) to prove you don't owe taxes etc and pay a $2,350 fee.
