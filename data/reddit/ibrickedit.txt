the "cash value" of bitcoin is what they exchange for you to connect a computer to the internet, and pay for electricity, and process bitcoin packets. 
The "cash value" of bitcoin is real enough. But, nobody ever asked what they were processing in exchange for the bitcoin

Thats what they tell you. If they told you it was for Iran you might not hook up your computer.

You admit defeat, when you start the name calling
Also, without credibility, your words are meaningless. You cant hurt anyones feelings, LOL!

You only encounter encryption if you are hacking
If you are processing a transaction legally it doesnt require CPU time 
What were/are the bitcoin miners doing
If you claim they were processing transactions,... there were no transactions in the beginning
SO WHAT WERE THEY PROCESSING
answer the question

You are familiar with loss, as you do it exclusively.
@_date: 2019-12-18 19:59:15
They wernt "cracking cryptography" they were processing simulations for Irans supercomputer.
@_date: 2019-12-18 18:45:49
what were the early miners doing
why do they need high end CPUS, and GPUS to do it. Do WHAT?
Answer the question

Just admit you have NO IDEA what a bitcoin miners computers are processing
It is exactly like SETI.
@_date: 2019-12-18 19:57:40
ya, the seti program processes "blocks"
Do you think the bitcoin miner's computers were just sitting there for 10 minutes? Lol?
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:32:00
You would have to be daft, to believe your computer is just sitting there, and you will get paid for it.

This is the best reply so far...
But, people dont download the code, compile, it, and use that executable, they download an executable,.. Iran's executable
If iran likes bitcoin to avoid sanctions, they would buy bitcoin, not mine it. Its stupid to mine bitcoin if you have truckloads of cash. Iran subsidizes bitcoin mining because they benifit from the mining itself. 
re asic come on man, a calculator is a calculator. I cant believe you said that. Maybe I take back best comment, comment

answer the question, genius
what were the first miners doing when there were NO transactions
@_date: 2019-12-18 21:46:42
Oh ya sure, and they will pay you to do nothing. 
A fool, and his CPU cycles are soon parted.
