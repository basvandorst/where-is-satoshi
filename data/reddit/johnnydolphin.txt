Looking at Bitcoin's past doesn't say anything about its future.

Well it's a perfect way to make decentralised transactions and get rid of banks. I'm definitely not an opponent. But it seems most people care about it because they think it will make them richer (again, richer in fiat currency)

No. People want dollars because dollars can actually be used everywhere to pay for things. Also Bitcoin is valued in... dollars. As long as Bitcoin's value is based on a dollar amount it is less useful than the dollar, except if you want to speculate. People are not sheep, they're rational. Yes, Bitcoin can change the world, but not as long as it is valued in dollars.

Yes, they do. Everything has a Fiat value, you're just proving my point. I guess there's no arguing with this sub lol, and I'm a supporter of Bitcoin...

I do know how it works, and what I meant is people only care about its fiat value. Just look at the posts and comments in this sub and you'll see people mostly hold it to make gains (in fiat) on the long term.

It's not new yet it was never used for anything significant except speculation. Those people aren't stupid. They choose what they can relate to and what can be used universally as a means of payment, and that isn't bitcoin.

Yes I'm aware, I am European and live in Brazil. I use Bitcoin every month to transfer money, not in dollars but in Euros and Brazilian Reais. What I'm saying is people care about the price of Bitcoin, which is expressed in Fiat... If those people knew 1BTC is 8k USD they would have taken it. Why? Because that means more Dollars. Those who want to hold Bitcoin want it because they expect it to rise in value, and that value is expressed in Fiat. So thanks for being condescending and calling everyone stupid when they actually just want to have money to pay for their shit.
