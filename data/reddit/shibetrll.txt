First valid argument i've seen. In what way is it less secure? 
@_date: 2014-01-26 09:30:43
Ok, so with this i can gather that if one coin wanted to attack antoher with say 30% their hashpower, which equals the others 51% hashpower, it can be done. Also true for non attached pools.
With the moments 92mh/s, you would need approx 46mh/s to achieve 51%. (dogecoin)
Network hashrate was calc to about 60mh/s for litecoins. So this means that litecoin actually have less security than dogecoin?
Also, when you say that its about the distribution. Shouldnt that mean that P2pool useage is a very good tool to lesser the likelyhood of attacks. Making pooling non necessary and in turn not giving this kinda mhash power to individuals.
Thank you for explaining this to me!

Wooot. This is some serious gestapo shit going on. "not allowed to fly with bitcoins" xD

I'm not quite sure i follow. You are talking about 51% attacks of the network?
Im sure when a coin matures the cost of such attacks are less likely to happen since it would be harder and very expensive. Also, since the scrypt algo can be gpu mined it's fair to gather that eventually alot of people will mine it. Alot of small miners equals a couple of big ones etc.

Dogecoin is not different to bitcoin in any way except there's more, and it is attracting alot of new attention to crypto scene. I really don't see why you guys are so buthurt over this

This type of thinking is in itself backwards and i am amazed that it actually exists within the scene. Bitcoin is created by the people, so is dogecoin and every other crypto that may come into being(ofc there will be exceptions). What is great about it is the community wanting to give. Same way anonymous have the guy fawkes mask as a maskot, the mascot in itself holds no values if there where no community behind it.

Just go sponsor another driver. There are tons of sponsor-less NASCAR drivers dude. It´s not like we patented sponsorship o.O
