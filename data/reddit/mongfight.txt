Goddamn right. I'm heading to the casino tonight with a hammer to change some rules on some slot machines. Wish me luck!

Sorry for your loss

So you're saying Bitcoin should have an IPO and become a subsidiary of eBay?

Actually, when you send it in all you get is a signed photo from the Secretary of the Treasury that says "Sorry for your loss. Next time keep your money in your wallet"

how do I find out which merchants in my area accept BTC as payment?

How do you spend them?

Then why not just call it an investment vehicle that you buy with fiat and then cash out into fiat when it goes up or down and stop pretending that it's a currency?

When the cops arrest you for attempted robbery, you can spend some time talking to bail bondsmen about the virtues of accepting Bitcoin. Then, when you're still in jail awaiting trial because none of them do, you'll have plenty of time to look into lawyers who accept Bitcoin, and extoll the virtues of BC to them. When you're finally appointed your public defender (because you failed to find an attorney who would take computer pesos as payment or return calls) you can explain exactly what you were trying to do (even though the clerk wasn't interviewed by the local news because a robbery gets at most 10 seconds and the clerk couldn't understand what you were asking for through the stocking you were wearing over your face. "He kept shouting that he wanted Biptown", he'll tell the cops. "Goddamn junkies," the cop will say to his partner, "get Alvarez from narcotics down here, looks like we've got a Biptown epidemic on our hands.") Your court-appointed defender will slowly nod his head because as soon as he heard the word Bitcoin he stopped listening and he'll get you a plea deal for 25 years with no parole and you'll take it because, in 25 years, your bits will be worth $20,000 per coin and the governor will likely intervene and commute your sentence once the human rights people point out that you were merely attempting to save humanity.
In the meantime, you'll work in the prison laundry for filthy fiat at a rate of $.10 per hour and fight to get the commissary to take BC as a form of payment. Which they won't. And you'll probably get stabbed by some guy named Viper who is sick and fucking tired of hearing you cry yourself to sleep every night.
Great plan. Go to it.

Geeks also have cash and are hoarding their Bitcoin as an "investment"
