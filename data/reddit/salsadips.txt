Yes because how dare a judge give a reasonable sentence to a drug lord who attempted to murder 6 people in cold blood. Really fucked up world when you cant even run a multimillion dollar drug empire and attempt to assassinate people without someone being on your case about it.

Did you really just equate facilitating the sale of weapons, stolen assets, false documents and drugs, including poison to having blue eyes? Whats wrong with you? There is a hell of a lot more to the drug world than what goes up your nose, but hey, the people that get murdered, tortured and kidnapped every day as a directresult of drugs aren't white middle class people so who the fuck cares right?

Oh god you are hilariously deluded. Your currency has gone from 1200 per coin to what, 350 in less that a year and you think this is the global financial future? 
I have no stake in bit coin because i sold my crypto to bagholders last year. This is just entertainment at this point.

It wasnt a fucking grocery stall, it was a place where you could buy almost any drug, guns and illegal weapons (until it was pulled for not being profitable enough), counterfeit cash, false documents and stolen credit cards.

We arent talking about banks getting hacked by china. We are talking about the statement where you explicitly said that anybody could email a *picture* to the banks CEO and therefore execute **any** code. 
Do you know how fucking retarded this sounds? This is why bitcoin fanatics get so much shit from everyone else. Yes, bitcoin offers an advantage over banks in several ways, we know that. Why do you feel the need to make up complete bullshit to try and defeat the *evil statist bankers* that are trying to sell your first born child to ISIS?
If you like bitcoin and feel that it has more pros than cons over banks, use bitcoin. If you want security and the benefits of an insured network (fees and fraud checks included), choose a bank.
@_date: 2014-11-13 13:15:56
Are you just conveniently forgetting about the huge amount of crime that bitcoin is associated with? What safeguards are in place in the event that my bitcoins get stolen? How about when i get scammed online? Banks have safeguards for both of these (chargebacks, fraud investigations, forensic experts etc etc). 
You are just another delusional cultist.

@_date: 2014-12-05 15:43:42
How is it very bad? Because you say so? Ive been scammed twice on ebay and twice i got my money back via paypal. Ive also once had my visa card cloned and the criminal attempted to make withdrawals from my account. My bank flagged it as fraud, called me up and saved me thousands of pounds. They notified me that they already knew who it was and they needed me to confirm that it was fraudulent. 
Now lets apply bitcoin to both of these. Scammed by a seller? Too bad. Had your wallet broken into? Too bad. 
You are SOL and there is nothing you can do about it and the theif will never be caught. 
How exactly is bitcoin better? 
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:28:27
Lets look at the Oxford english dictionary definition of a shill.
NORTH AMERICANinformal
noun: shill; plural noun: shills
an accomplice of a confidence trickster or swindler who poses as a genuine customer to entice or encourage others.
A pump is the first phase of a [pump and dump]( scheme. To 'extoll its virtues' is exactly what you do in a pump and dump scheme. You promote and preach about how amazing it is in hope that more people adopt it, thus inflating the value, at which point you will sell. Admit it, you just want to inflate the price so you can get rich without doing anything. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 19:33:49
Yep, [Bitcoin]( crushes [Apple](
@_date: 2014-11-10 09:06:31


Source? This sounds like yet another satistic pulled out thin air.
@_date: 2014-12-12 10:01:40
Im calling bullshit.
Firstly, you have been involved in  bitcoin for over a year now. A quick glance at your post history proves that. Also that you have this [stupid tattoo]( which again, proves you are very devoted to the cause.
You have financial interests at heart, not bitcoins success. You post a lot in and and you come across as someone who is using bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme.
You faked these screenshots by using inspect element. Then you posted them with a bullshit story that your bank gave you 220k of someone elses money, yet there is no media coverage of this at all (if this actually happened, the news would be all over it). 
This post was made for the sole purpose of creating FUD which promotes bitcoin which drives up price which means that you get rich quick/recover some of your losses.
This story is completely fabricated and you know it OP. Go to a cashpoint and take a photo of the 220k usd that you supposedly have available to you. Prove that you arent just another bullshitter trying to desperately start a pump.
@_date: 2014-12-05 13:34:50

Post them. Im sure we would all enjoy a good laugh at this shill list you've created.
@_date: 2014-12-05 09:56:52
Yeah with bitcoin you can just run off with the money and never send the goods and there is absolutely nothing the buyer can do about it!
@_date: 2014-11-13 13:59:49
Where is this runaway inflation? I keep hearing about it here but i cant actually see any evidence of it. 
Can you direct me to news sources about the banks that have shutdown and run off with all of its holdings like MtGox/mining pools/exchanges/other businesses such as BFL and Moolah? While youre at is, link me to all the totally random deposit confiscations that just happen because the FBI wants to buy a new car. Oh wait, you cant.
@_date: 2014-11-20 10:08:51
Then you call your bank. They investigate your account and try and recover your money, often successfully. Chargebacks prevent scams and fraud investigations make prosecutions. If you use bit coin then you are SOL if someone scams or hacks you.
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:44:46
It means to publicly endorse something because you are being paid to do it. You are promoting bitcoin because you will get paid more if it is successful. Therefore you are shilling bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 10:02:46
My gf told me not to cash out at 190 and i didnt and just held until the next spike, kinda pissed about it now but oh well, still made money and got a basically free high end graphics card out of it.
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:20:30
Which is exactly what happens with paypal. Money is reversed and held in escrow till a resolution is found in the unlikely event you are scammed.
If you are scammed and you paid in bitcoin you will never see your money again.
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:45:28
You're admitting that you are involved in bitcoin for the money (through the fact that you want to pump the value), therefore you are only promoting it because you have money to gain from it.

Yup, a finanical company complying with financial laws is whats giving bitcoin a bad rep, not butterfly labs, moolah, silk road and dark net markets, dpr, purse.io, countless alt coin scams, blockchain.info thefts, credit card chargeback scams and lets not forget mt gox and the 'pioneers of bitcon' who assured that everything was all fine and dandy.

@_date: 2015-01-09 15:39:41




You are delusional and living in a fantasy world. Police enforcement does not exist in drug producing countries and the ones that do are easily paid off. So drugs are more or less legal because no one is around to enforce the laws. My own family lives in Peru. A large exporter of heroin, cocaine and opium. Drugs have destroyed large parts of the community, through violence and theft. My family have 3 guard dogs and an enclosed wall with a gate and barbed wire because if they dont they will be shot and killed because of people who need money for drugs. They have seen people murdered for drug debts. One guy was burnt alive by a fuel filled tyre that was put around his waist. Imagine seeing that for one second and then tell me that drugs are a non violent crime. It has nothing to do with police. Its the addiction and money that causes violence.
Stop. Denying. Reality.
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:02:23
Have you been psychologically evaluated? Because i genuinely think you are very delusional. The fact that you cannot make the link between drug traffickers and extreme violence within the drug trade is very worrying to me.
Who grows your drugs? Who dies to gain control over the production of it? Who dies when police crack down on cartels/gangs? Who transports it to your country and your subsequent vendor? Do they do it volentarily? Whos families die when they run to the police? Who gets shot if they dont comply? Who dies due to unpaid debts? Whos families die due to debts? Are these not all people who are directly involved in getting your drugs to you? Ross himself ordered the assassinations of several people, and in his mind, he had already had people killed.
If a gun is sold to someone, knowing they will kill people with it, is the seller not responsible for anything? 
I hope Ross gets a long time in prison. I hope he dies there. He facilitated a market which kills millions of people. He deserves everything he gets.
@_date: 2015-01-01 10:26:46
He was out by 75 bucks and had a pretty accurate prediction. A lot of people here  were out by 5 figures.

@_date: 2015-04-13 13:17:35
Except thats not true at all. Ive been using paypal for years, had people attempt chargeback scams a few times and have always won. If you dont document things properly when trading digital goods, you are susceptible to a chargeback scam. Kinda like if you dont follow the 500 steps to protecting your bitcoin wallet, you are susceptible to having all your coins irreversibly stolen.
Bitcoin is totally irreversible, which while it eliminates chargeback scams, it facilities a great deal more scams.
