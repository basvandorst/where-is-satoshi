bitcoin users shy away from fnlondon.com articles citing them as spam.

Trump should be impeached.  He's a moron.

I always cringe when I read "opportunity for profit" with regards to bitcoin.
It's called theft.  It's little more than privileged people trying to take money from the less fortunate like everything else in the same vein.

Onchain confirmations are ~10 min.  Lightning makes them almost immediate and scales beyond Visa, etc.

Let them screw themselves.
They aren't going to stop bitcoin.  It's going to spread like a virus over the next 3 years.
People want freedom.  Fuck politicians and bankers.
They are largely the must corrupt people on the planet and the root cause of a great deal of injustice in this world.

Fuck Drudge and his site.

Dude is trying to get site hits.  Go away.

Hi guy with .1 BTC or less.  You will never be rich.

You are/were one of the top 20k users to their site...?  So, you now have like .00001 bitcoin?
Congrats.  Go buy some gum.

New scam just like the old scam.  
Show proof they've gotten the tape out and and have begun manufacturing.
FUCK OFF.

Do you have any conception of how the contemporary monetary system works, genius?
It requires stealing from people to pay for war to kill people you do not know.  Some of them may be ridiculously talented.
Let's kill them though.  You want a pool and a mansion in the Hamptons.
You are trash.

Doesn't matter.  The talent is behind bitcoin/Bitcoin.
Microsoft is building its distributed identity platform on the BTC Blockchain.
The majority of people who hold a great deal of bitcoin do not like Ver or his previous attempts to take over bitcoin (XT, Unlimited).
Ver needs to go away at this point.

"NATHANIEL POPPER,"  author of the article, is a parrot and nothing more.
How much electricity does the global banking system chew through daily?  Bitcoin may help to eliminate that.
Tired argument.  Go away

The majority of the people in this sub have "maybe" a tenth of a bitcoin.  They are never going to be rich as a result.
Instead, bitcoin might better be thought of as a saving account with variable interest.  Saving accounts held with banks used to give interest.  That is largely no longer the case.

I've had been negative for approximately 2.5 years.  
Most everyone laughed at me.  
I believe this will help change the world.  It is most likely be 3-5 years before we see it...  
I backed this project beginning in 2013 with my hard earned money to help make a difference in the world. 
I'm not very good with computers but my friend told me about the concept.  It made sense. 
I don't think it will become successful because of Coinbase.
bitcoin isn't a peer-to-peer currency that relies on a government funded startup in the states that has ties to Wall Street, right?
Am I dumb?
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:35:31
Go away.  You put up a new website.  Yay?

Most of the people among the top BTC holders are, in theory, better people than the top USD holders.  This excludes Roger Ver.  He's a piece of shit.
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:44:52
The powers that be will push it down to 7-8k if not further.
Ignore the FUD headlines.  They are trying to push all the noobs out.
Edit:  I've seen some shit.  Despite the age of my UID, I've been here since 2013.  Many have been here longer, of course.  I'm still a noob in the grand scheme of things.
