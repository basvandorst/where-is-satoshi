Paper wallet! Get one, its free, and you cannot be hacked. Memorize the last letter of your private key and tear it out. Then anyone finding your paper wallet cannot get your money either unless they torture you or something :)

 How would you guess it? It is a random letter. Is it a? c? is it x? or an l?
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:08:19
Not in a paper wallet. You cannot brute force 29 letters in blockchain or any other client me thinks. Also, once you know someone has your paper wallet, you can move it before they have a chance.
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:22:47
Yeah but it is on a paper wallet, and the suspect stole it from your house or work place. I think you will be aware that there is a theft and by the time he/she comes up with all 62 combinations and address generation, you will have already moved your stuff to some other address. Come on, there are not many thiefs that are this smart.

These people are just trying to keep bitcoin down because
A. They do not own any
B. They are old
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:59:56
Sounds good now that especially cnbc and other culprits are trying take down bitcoin, it needs to keep up with the times.

@_date: 2018-01-09 08:06:28
Lets go ahead and get to it already. All people are complaining about bitcoin, other than the price, is the slowness and fees. Since this will solve the speed problem, what are we waiting for?

Canada seems more free all of a sudden. I like what you said here.
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:59:51
They have been around since 2009, so not sure how they are shady.

Use lastpass and login only if and when it shows a password for the said site. Unless it shows password for that site do not login.

Why not become a banker with nebeus, then you can make some money.
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:30:04
@_date: 2018-09-18 15:16:42
Yeah the same here though I got them a lot earlier.

I think the answer is Basic Universal Income, which can be done using crypto. Then everyone can do what they love to top their income. Check out Star Trek Next Generation.
Swiftdemand has been doing something similar but they still need their marketplace to grow.
@_date: 2018-09-16 08:48:14
Well, it is about time the banks get into the action. I just hope it will be something like mutual funds and not just futures. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 10:02:57
Well somebody has to produce the food and somebody has to serve it. If everyone had lots of money it would be Venezuela. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 10:54:47
And now add the darn futures and such. You got a crazy mix. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 09:01:42
Lol  very fun yet shows bitcoins strength. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 14:14:47
Why did they approve futures then? They are biased. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 01:00:08
Well, it would be nice to see the whole article. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 15:38:03
How did he say that if Twitter blocked him.

Bakkt hired former Coinbase vice president Adam White as COO. So even that thing is bullish news.

I want to sell my Elder Scrolls ingame gold. I know some ICO platforms are coming out but I wonder if there's one already.
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:17:35
Wait until I sell. Then it will moon me thinks. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:51:54
Wow. And you are telling people to buy now. That's just rich. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 21:20:37
Well, I made bitcoin cookies, it is a nice art as well. Check it out:
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:27:25
Well, I wish I remembered the days when Bitcoin was 10 USD! I was trying to get my tenure back then :(
@_date: 2018-06-21 15:09:36
Wow. I did not know it was this secure. What do you say against the quantum comments though?
@_date: 2018-06-05 21:17:35
The automoderator thought it was about an altcoin, lol. That is why you need context, you cannot judge by looking at words alone.
@_date: 2018-06-17 06:29:42
Why would you say that it is bad? He will use solar power and maybe he has smart people working for him. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:14:02
Sounds like something I would do. But the secret is, I have not sold yet :)
@_date: 2018-06-21 16:51:09
Do you care to elaborate more on that and why it is bullshit? I am really curious.
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:29:20
You got to love that it is in cartoons now.
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:15:56
It is highly likely that they will do what they did with bitcoin gold. Wait until the last second to announce it, and then say we will keep your new coins for ourselves :)

Vertex market is an otc which means over the counter. They have an escrow service so your funds are safer compared to anything that does not have that.

I like this one: You agree to have this information shared with the IRS, FBI, CIA, NSA, Federal Reserve, ECB, Interpol, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Equifax, Chainalysis, and your parents.
@_date: 2018-11-02 06:20:14
Lol I love it. So funny 
@_date: 2018-11-11 10:15:26
I could not agree more with this. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 09:55:42
Thank you very much, it worked just fine!
Note: I used the second one.
@_date: 2018-07-07 10:13:00
Lol. Love the artwork ��

Digitize platform has a very good potential. It saves us money, and helps us with the change problem.
@_date: 2019-09-23 06:56:39
Use non custodial wallets such as coinomi or trust wallet. Then import your private key. The phrase they give you can be used to extract private keys. If you lose your phone you can enter the same phrases and you can also import your private key again. So the first post saying the wallet changes your private key is wrong. You keep your paper wallet and it will be your private key forever. The non custodial wallet progeamay be deleted then you use your 12 words phrase from that wallet to get back anything for that wallet.

Fair enough. When there is no login, I go to add site, and make up a simple login name, add it to lastpass for that site.
So whenever I am on the correct site, it shows login information. When the site is a phishing site, it shows no login info!

And Home Depot co-founder says that he can use his credit card everywhere he goes and he can spend his own money. Clearly he has not tried to send money abroad or somebody else is buying his cars for him.
@_date: 2019-05-30 09:55:37
Great answers. Anyone know how to withdraw fiat to credit card by selling bitcoin?
So I should be able to sell my bitcoin or eth and withdraw usd to my credit card. 
Deposit is easy compared to withdrawal
@_date: 2019-05-16 06:21:07
Wow it is hard to believe. Now we are talking about satoshis instead of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:14:12
Use lastpass. When it is the correct site it shows a 1 sign on top of its logo as you have a password for that site. If it is the wrong sign it does not show any login information.
