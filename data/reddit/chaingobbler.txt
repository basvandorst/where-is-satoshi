Somewhat of a Bitcoin noob here. I've used bitcoin probably back in 2014 or so when it was ~$500 (wish I had bought and held on to it back then.) I'm wondering as it seems people are having issues with coinbase recently, what are the preferred methods or mediums of bitcoin exchange. And also, recommended wallets for a noob who doesn't want to buy a hardware wallet, yet.

Just want to add to this that margin trading is incredibly risky. Not that you shouldn't do it, but be very careful. If your investment decreases you can get margin called and the brokerage can liquidate your holding to pay themselves back and you can even end up owing more money on top of your deposit. Personally, would never buy bitcoin on margin. With its volatility the way it is chance of margin call way too high. Credit card is an option, but be aware that selling incurs a capital gains tax on top of transaction fees/transfer fees.

Not on the surface level. But credit cards are a cause of inflation. Think about this scenario. You sell a product. Somebody gives you $50 for each one. Now a vast majority of people buy that item with a credit card that cost you 3% of that sale price. Your profit margin just went down by some amount that’s even more than 3%. You subsequently raise your prices to accommodate the 3% transaction fee. Then as other prices rise you must follow suit as your production costs raise because most businesses also use credit cards to settle their bills. So I’m the end the consumer always pays more with the use of credit cards. And the credit companies use the rewards as an incentive for consumers to keep spending on a credit card and keep their profits rolling in. Pretty much just taking advantage of most people’s inability to handle their finances.

Was early December actually. So it’s been a while.
