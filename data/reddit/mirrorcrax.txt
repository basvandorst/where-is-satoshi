Will PM you. May not be too late if you are still in the UAE.
@_date: 2016-08-31 11:57:13
Indeed. I'm owed 10-22K USD Since October 2015. They changed the status of my withdrawal to complete without sending any money and currently ignore all my communication.

Been waiting since October 26th.

Do you know of any anti-fraud entity in India with whom you can report them. I also requested a withdrawal on October 26th, nothing was done, I even provided alternative bank accounts and even requested to cancel the withdrawal and transfer my Bitcoins but nothing still. I have already contacted several papers in the UAE. I would strongly suggest you start by doing the same in India.

Requested FIAT withdrawal since October 26th. Nothing yet. Very poor support. Highly questionable.

Hey gregors24up. You are one amongst many replies that seem patronising in the sense people who deal with Igot haven't done their research. In my case, I started dealing with them more than 1 year ago, they were in the press, had a legitimate local bank account, local office and no negative feedback, they were even expanding to many other countries. So in all fairness take it easy on us. We're just trying to raise awareness for the new prospective igot clients and people researching igot as well as exercising pressure on Igot to get back our funds. Kicking us while we're down isn't really helping.

Registered with them one year ago and transferred money to their UAE bank account after researching their legitimacy online (they were on a roll back then, being featured in the news as a local btc exchange, expanding into other countries ....etc.) I kept trading for almost a year and when I had enough and wanted to cut my losses I requested withdrawal on October 26th and have been waiting since then. The only way to reach them is through email hello or support ticket and both are ignored for the majority of the time. I reported them to ACORN in Australia for cyber fraud, reported them to their UAE bank, twitter, Facebook,  forums ...you name it. There seems to be a huge backlog of delayed payments stemming 5 months back from uae, OZ and India. There are also a lot of question marks regarding their legitimacy. 1. They claim to be Australian but their only affiliation with Australia was back in 2013 and 'Rick Day' being an Australian citizen 2. 'Rick Day' as he appears in an interview on YouTube seems a very shades character, first off his name seems really made up, second even if he is an OZ citizen why is his company incorporated in Hong Kong? Why is he staying in Newyork? Why are all his friends on Facebook limited and seem more like business acquaintances?  3. Igot recently acquired tagpesa in Kenya and Kenyan centre bank has recently issued a warning against dealing in BBC so their accounts must've gotten frozen there 4. They informed me their UAE bank account is closed and yet they still claim to be a local UAE exchange 5. They have no phone contact numbers 6. All the addresses published online are for shared offices which are usually virtual desks 7. The terms and conditions are very shades especially with regards to the arbitration clause in Hong Kong.  All in all, they could be a poorly run business by a shadey incompetent guy 'Rick Day' who has stretched his promise beyond his capabilities or 2. Is a ponzi scheme 3. Or is an outright international scam or 4. A combination of 1 and 2 especially after they got short of FIAT after shutting down a couple of their bank accounts according to other client stories . Do what can you do? 
1. Use social media to warn others
2. Contact the authorities in your country (regulators, police, central bank)
3. Contact your bank 
4. Contact the press

Latest update. Igot.com decided to just change the status of my withdrawal to "confirmed" despite not sending me any money. If that's how they reached their claim of 40% completed transactions I suppose they're just providing us with more court evidence. Keep it coming.
@_date: 2016-02-16 20:58:10
Since when please. Also can I please have your first and last name. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 03:36:08
They owe me more than 10 thousand USD since October 26th, 2015. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 04:07:57
Hey, any news on your withdrawal? Mine is still pending since October 26th and I keep getting fake promises from Rick repeatedly for the past 4 weeks. Seems like courts is the only way to go. If you haven't gotten anywhere yet, let me know.
@_date: 2016-02-16 01:57:34
Will do. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:22:21
Any luck yet?
@_date: 2016-02-21 02:16:31
sent you a PM
@_date: 2016-02-13 15:41:57
I used igot. Wish I hadn't. Missing 10K+ USD since October 26th with continuous fake promises and several indications that its fraudulent. Currently preparing for legal action:

Requested withdrawal on Octobet 26th at a loss because needed the FIAT price rose 20% afterwards then dropped back and I haven't received my money to this day! 
Replies to my support ticket were brief, vague and unassuring untill they closed my ticket and I had to reopen it! Now they just decided to ignore it all together.
I realize there is compliance challenges especially with money transfer security risks but come on, if that was the case why aren't all exchanges struggling? Why did you tell me my agreement is not with the UAE but with a Hong Kong entity? Why did you close the ticket? I am losing trust with every passing day. 
If others have dealt with Igot in the UAE and found similar issues please contact me.

Requested withdrawal on October 26th. Vague replies, unfullfilled promised dates. Nothing so far except worry and anxiousness!
@_date: 2015-11-24 22:21:05
Still nothing yet
@_date: 2015-11-15 16:11:24
I haven't received my 10kusd either since October 26th. They told me they no longer have a bank account in the UAE! After I got a response from Julie saying the Fiat will arrive soon, I got another reply over email it won't be anytime before two weeks. I am really struggling to stop myself from taking them to court.
