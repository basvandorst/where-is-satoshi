You are welcome! We've always used PayPal in the past for online donations, but one of our employees is really into Bitcoin and thought it would be a great way for us to raise funds online. Any little bit helps when it comes to nonprofit organizations, so we gladly embraced it.

We've been receiving donations just by placing our Bitcoin address on our site and from a few posts we've made. I can totally see an organization using  or something similar to make things easier on donors.

Please don't use a hammer! :-) Our tech guy is really into Bitcoin and he introduced it to us. As a nonprofit, it's helpful to have new ways of fundraising, and the Bitcoin community has been wonderful ever since we got started. &lt;3

Are you sure you're the first? :-) Our nonprofit dental clinic that serves low-income, uninsured individuals in Kansas has been in the Bitcoin game for a while now.

Primarily donations, but if someone came in wanting to pay with Bitcoin, and they met our qualification guidelines (low-income, uninsured, live in our county) then we would most definitely see them.
