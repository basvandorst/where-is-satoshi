I'm not a hardcore bitcoin user, but do have some in savings.
When I bought it, the market was still pretty big (I think it was around $670-700 per bitcoin). When that was happening, I had about ~$40 worth of bitcoin. And ever since school happened, I didn't really keep up with the market until yesterday when I checked and it had drastically lowered.
My question is, what happened to bitcoin that in a 6 month span, the monetary value of bitcoin halved, and in about a year it's the third of what it used to be? I was not here when bitcoin hit the $1000 mark, but came after the crash. 
When will it stop declining, and start increasing?

It's not him about knowing, I asked him his opinion. That's what I meant by "do you think".

So with everyone you listed, do you think bitcoin is at a market price, or do you think that it'll continue to fall/rise?

So, economically it's been devastating, while things being pretty much the same?
What will it take for bitcoin to be worth in the $700-$800 again?

Sorry, I'm not familiar with Star Wars at all. Can the siths predict future?

No problem. I was just curious as to how it got to the $1000 mark though without all the new people that you're talking about right now. It's not like the glamour of internet magic money wore off. It's still very fascinating (and foreign) to me.

That seems like a simple explanation. Thanks.

Well, I'm talking more long term than short. As an overall market, do you think bitcoin right now is undervalued, overvalued, or at the right price?
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:44:14
Oops. Sorry, I thought that was how to say it. I'll change it now!
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:49:02
So you think bitcoin prices will be rising again soon?
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:57:56
How are bitcoin prices really calculated? Is it by individual websites? Is it by a governing body? Is it by the seller? How does a international currency like bitcoin tracked?

That makes a lot of sense now. Thank you for the knowledge!

Oh no, I don't think I understand bitcoin enough to try to make money off it. I got about $10 worth of bitcoin when coinbase was doing their promotion, and bought some bitcoin also, and it's sitting at about $25, but I don't think I will actively try to seek monetary gain from it.
