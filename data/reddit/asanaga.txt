He is kind of a bandit. He organized pumps and dumps and involved in ripping off people.
He is bad for crypto money. Actually we should neglect him.

I would invest all of them in non mineable chinese projects like; NULS, NEO, VEN, ONT. and wait until 2018 december...

Becuase mineable coins are becoming dangerous. Look at XVG. Attacked 3 times. Everyday more powerful mining equipments are appering.

I am from Turkey. Lived and raised in here. I am teacher and I can classified myself as a well educated member of the society. Based on what I see I can say that we have nothing to do with europen culture and society. We are absolutely not europeans . Our customs culture  are quite diffrent. Also we have one huge difference and it is religion. Islam has absolutely different rules than European laws and lifestyle.
The best partnership with EU can be based on some economic and educational programs. Nothing much...

I am a teacher from Turkey. I personally invested in block chain. Even if i lose everyting, i would invest more just for the sake of supporting this decentralized alternative non inflation curreny. When people begin to understand decentralization and financial freedom they will invest more.
To be honest, today if a sell a house or car i would keep all my money in BTC. I am saying BTC because almost everyting (alts) else can be classified as shitcoins.
