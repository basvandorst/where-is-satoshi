He took a financially ruined state, cut taxes 14 times, vetoed any bill that didn't pay for itself and left a state running with a billion dollar surplus.
Advocates personal freedom, lower taxes, abolishing the IRS and cutting the budget in the 2 digit percentages.
He's not a libertarian crusader extremist, but a sane centrist that can definitely do some good - and without doubt the best candidate that runs in 2016.

The thing you’re neglecting here of course is “how much more in taxes”.  Obviously if it’s a 1% increase it’s worth it, and if it’s a 50% increase it’s not. It’s a calculation that needs to be reflected.
That, along side of “is there a way to actually lower the cost of education”, instead of “let’s shift the payment to the tax money”.

True, and the U.S.A is definitely the letter. You know, with the top 1% of earners paying almost 40% of the federal income taxes[1]


There's a lot to fix, but saying the American system is terrible again just lacks perspective. It's a great system that delivers great results, and can get much better with proper changes.


I'll that to the Americans living in poverty as well. I'll them a few other things too:
A. That likes moving the goal-post in discussions. Starting by talking about the cost of education and healthcare as signs of dystopia, and shifting it to poverty when he realises how absurd that claim is.
B. That the American poverty line is $12,228[2] while the world's median wage is $9,733[3]. American POOR are making more than most people on earth. How fucking dystopian.

A. Nothing's free. Someone's paying for it.
B. The US is the richest nation in the world partly due to the fact it doesn't subsidise many things.
C. Your definition of "a damn dystopia" as "a country with high quality but high-cost education and healthcare" lacks proportion. This is really, as you've said, a rich nation's problem. I think you Americans like to say something along the lines of "check your privileges"?
D. I'm from the UK. Things here in Europe aren't the utopia Moore is trying to paint. Not that I'm complaining, the UK is an awesome country as well (even though I'd take American healthcare any day of the week).

@_date: 2014-02-17 05:25:20
Not really, because the number of bitcoins won't expand forever. Thus a fix number of coins have to spread across a larger economy. That makes them more valuable. That people exchanging to fiat immediately will increase liquidity, thus stabling the price. That makes the currency safer to hold. Which will in turn make less people exchange immediately, making the fixed number of coins raise in value further.
I may be completely wrong, but that makes sense to me.
@_date: 2014-04-05 07:34:02
- a few things:
First of, I thoroughly enjoy reading your posts. Your writing skills are amazing, even without taking your age into account. I can only assume you read a lot, which is regrettably not as common as one would hope in the 21st century. Keep at it.
Regarding the content of your post:
It's great knowing that teens are interested in Bitcoin - the next few years are the turning point for cryptocurrencies and if it will really turn out to be the future of money as we all believe, it's a good things the next generation of innovation is already being exposed to it.
I agree with your main concern. The barrier of entry for the crypto world is too high - not because of high monetary requirements but due to the great complexity involved. I believe it is in the works of being solved at the moment - the Bitcoin ATMs being spread will greatly ease the entry process.
Please keep filling us in on your generation's sentiment on Bitcoin, it's a largely untapped market that is of high importance. Anything that can be done to make Bitcoin more appealing to teens will be of great value to all of us.
Take care. :)
@_date: 2015-01-21 06:46:13
Exactly. This is why short position are very high risk.
With long positions the most you can lose is the amount you invested (price goes to zero).
With short positions, theoretical lose is infinite (as maximum price is theoretical infinite).
That is true for every commodity, not just Bitcoin.
Of course, there are usually measures in place to stop short positions before the trader cannot afford to buy back.

Hmm... No. There are plenty of solutions that don't involve coercion and won't lead to OMG THE POOR ARE DYING YOU ANIMAL HOW COULD YOU. Anything from insurance to none-profits.
For them to be effective you need the market to actually be free and that companies could compete in offering treatment. Antibiotics don't cost $14,324, and the only way a company could charge that much is if someone prevents competitors from offering services (you know, socialists).

We might just had a bit of a mis-communication then. :)
This is the gist of the conversation as I understood it - let me know when we veered off track:
* expressed distain from Universal Health Care, and socialism in general.
* responded to by saying sarcastically agreeing that "poor people should die" -&gt; implying that socialism and UHC is the best course of action for society and specifically for the poor.
* I responded to by mentioning that Socialism is much more effective at killing the poor (either compared to free market enterprises or even to the current state of affairs in the US, none are specifically mentioned).
* You responded to me by setting a dichotomy of either staying with the current system where people pay exuberant prices for health care, or moving to a universal healthcare system (inferred. you might have suggested moving to Socialism and that's a whole other discussion)
* I responded to you by explaining my position of adopting other solutions to healthcare other than universal health care - agreeing the current system is flawed and suggesting we move to one where the government control less (not more) of healthcare.
* You responded by saying what I'm describing is the situation currently in effect in the US and yet the poor has issues in this system.
* I responded by explaining how far removed we are from the healthcare system I'm describing
* You agreed in a fashion that appears like we were making the same point.
* I was confused.
Where did we go off track? Did I misunderstand something you said? Did you misunderstand me?

Sadly, this is not the case in the U.S. - not by a long shot. Healthcare is one of the most heavily regulated sectors in America, and opening a hospital or even a small clinic is incredibly hard. If it was easier, there would be clinics that will take the business of that guy with staph infection, or even a community clinic that will care for him for free through charity donations.
We know antibiotics costs a fraction that what hospitals charge the insurance companies. So we know there's something stopping either them or someone else from offering them at a lower cost. This is not how a free market looks like.

Who funded the building of that car either by monetary investment or by building it himself?
To be self-owning, the creator must give away his ownership - and why would anyone do that?
@_date: 2016-09-13 09:57:43
I still fail to see how giving up the ownership of the car is incentivized. I understand the autonomy aspect, how the cars will choose the best upgrades automatically and so forth - but why will the car own itself and not be owned by the maker/purchaser?
In the company models you provided, there is incentive. When the workers own most of the company that means the original owner had more to gain by giving up some of his control that he had by keeping it. How does this happen with a self owning car? What do I have to gain by giving the car ownership over itself?
