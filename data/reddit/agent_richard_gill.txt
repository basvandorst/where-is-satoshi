Fight it. Don't hire a lawyer. Read your merchant account agreement, find out where the jurisdiction over the account is, and file a claim. There may be an arbitration clause. File for arbitration. You can do all of these things yourself, the worst you have to lose is the $250 you have already had taken away from you, and you will probably have them hand over the money once you cause them more than $250 of time wasted. Remember that you DON'T have to hire a lawyer because you're a small business. They're incorporated so they HAVE to since, in the eyes of the court, the corporation cannot defend itself, and the interests of the corporation are not aligned with the interests of its individual shareholders/officers. Unless your business is also incorporated, in which case you have to hire a lawyer too, so forget it. But if you're not incorporated then forget a lawyer and start wasting their money until they give in. This should take all of an hour of a lawyer's time and they're already in the hole.

Actually, depending on the bank and/or merchant processor, they may not have representation in your area, so they usually subcontract to a local attorney. This costs them hourly. Also, you would be surprised how quick they are to just give in if you are costing them money. You're right in saying that they don't roll over because they don't want everyone getting over on them. They pay these lawyers/staff to keep the average claimant from just taking their money back, but once you start costing them money then they usually just let it go. They don't care about the $250, or even $2500. That kind of money isn't even on their radar. They just don't want everyone to be able to cost them money.
