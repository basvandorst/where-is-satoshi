Thanks were all on Twitter too.

A dip?? How is it a dip if the price would have been the ALH yesterday, and unthinkable a mere month ago?!

The gov't doesn't treat BTC like a currency in regards to taxation. It treats it like a stock.

Because I would rather potentially go broke than sit on the sidelines and watch other people get rich. No other reason. I don't have any sort of allegiance to Bitcoin, no philosophical belief in it, or even a particularly concrete understanding of the backend mathematics.
I love gambling. I love the thrill. I know I have an acute ability to HODL.  I just want to get rich.

But the sales tax to register it would be paid regardless, so that's kind of irrelevant right?

What would happen if I bought 1 BTC at $5,000 and it appreciated to $15,000 and then I bought a used car from someone in exchange for my 1 BTC (the used car value is $15,000). Do I have to pay capital gains tax if I never realized said gains in USD?

Well just to clarify, it is certainly not a pin *yet*. What evidence would make you think it is??

If you hard fork the controlling party will now be the controlling party of both currencies.

Are you suggesting that there aren’t at least 100 governments significantly worse and less fair than the US? Is Russia not a worse criminal gang?  Would you put the US right up there with ISIS and the North Korean dictatorship?

I’m not saying it couldn’t be the currency of the internet. Otherwise I wouldn’t be here.
What I’m saying is that right now it is *definitely* not the currency of the internet.
@_date: 2019-10-25 20:12:28
Just to clarify, you believe your access to the internet is decentralized?
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:58:31
Can you provide even a single piece of evidence that backs up this claim? This is why this sub has become such a joke.
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:24:07
The USD is just as much of the internet as Bitcoin. USD, for the most part, does not exist in physical form. It exists on online ledgers, the same as Bitcoin.

Well real estate and Bitcoin have real, intrinsic value. Rare coins do not. Unless you want to argue that you can melt them and use the metals for something.

Bruh we are a decade+ away in the small chance that it ever happens.
@_date: 2019-01-24 15:38:12
To me this stuff always seems like some side projects a team was working on when the Bitcoin craze happened but didn’t get it out in time. Then they just release it anyways with no promotion just because they were already in so deep.

A better way to think of it is this: you're borrowing from your future, more successful self. The US defecit is pretty high and I'd like to see it lowered, but it's only slightly over 1 year GDP. 
It isn't completely analogous, but would you find it concerning for someone making $100,000/yr to be in $100,000 in debt, assuming they had secured reasonably low interest rates?

What sort of legal standards is Coinbase held to? Like I almost feel bad that they have to endure such difficult industry changing decisions. Problems unlike any other industry with no real precedent to go off of.  
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:50:31
This is the most financially illiterate statement I've ever read.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:06:42
Can someone explain to me if I could end up with double the coins? Like can my coins be on both blockchains and just sell one side? Sorry for the noob question
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:07:32
So if I have my btc on a trezor i could in theory double my money?
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:19:52
Is a massive financial corp trading bitcoin what we want? "Trading" feels like they will just be trying to time markets to squeeze some dollars out of the system. Instead, don't we want some major players to make a large BTC reserve so as to possibly hedge against the legitimacy of their fiat currencies?

There is $BRK-A trading at around $287,000 and also $BRK-B trading around $180 and basically just mirros the A stock

Wait, are you seriously suggesting that a god has given us rights? How can we possibly make logical policy when we have people who believe a “divine Creator” has granted us some sort of bill of rights, despite there being absolutely no scientific evidence that such a thing has transpired?
Look, I don’t ever want to infringe on someone’s religious rights. But when you start wanting to make policy based on the word of god...well that’s where I lose you.

So is there anyway to safely profit from it?

How is it inherently “the right of the people to abolish the government”. What natural law is dictating that? It just so happens the American people decided that is how it should be. Your statement is objectively false.
You *believe* it should be universally true.
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:35:32
What does leveraging bitcoin mean? Sorry if that's a noob question
@_date: 2018-07-23 00:20:55
No. It has now been generally accepted as true for hundreds of years of American populous.
@_date: 2018-07-22 18:36:36
What are you talking about? Americans have decided all men are created equal. Unless Venezuela has that clause in their constitution then they have not decided that. 
The Australian constitution could say “no men are created equal”. Does that make it universally true? No. It only makes it true in Australia.


Yes. We *Americans* have been endowed *by our government* these rights. Not Venezuelans.
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:57:55
Why are you quoting the US Declaration of Independence as if it has anything to do with Venezuela...?  Venezuelans are not entitled to the rights outlined in this document.
@_date: 2018-07-22 18:40:54
What are you talking about? I believe the American constitution is impeccable, but that doesn’t mean I would impose it on a sovereign nation.
