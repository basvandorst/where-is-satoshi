how did they speak without mouths?

I'm having issues just trying to withdraw money at a foreign ATM. It's not even like middle of nowhere, it's in South Korea where there are banks and ATMs EVERYWHERE. They simply say I can't withdraw cash using their ATMs (which say GLOBAL SERVICE on them) because it's a debit card. The whole situation is ludicrous and makes cryptos so very needed.

I just thought about what if Korean exchanges are doing mass arbitrage? It's really really illegal in Korea sooooo... yeah.
@_date: 2018-08-31 12:37:59
@_date: 2018-05-31 05:37:12
uh there's definitely a difference in price across platforms. they're almost never perfectly matched up, especially between Korean platforms and all others. Arbitrage was a big point of contention at the start of the year for Korean lawmakers.

Yeah this is exactly why I'm sure fluffypony doesn't care at all about the delisting. If anything, it's what he wants.
@_date: 2019-11-06 22:17:04
Exchanges are delisting it under government pressures. They can't track it or take their cut

Bithumb is far from the biggest one in Korea anymore and hasn't been for a while. They moved their HQ to Singapore largely to avoid Korean regulations.
The financial services commissioner in Korea spoke out against privacy tokens specifically but for cryptos. Then met all the major exchanges in Seoul. The next week they all delisted our favorites.
@_date: 2019-11-07 01:30:58
The big Korean exchanges delisted them as well. Korean exchanges account for a large portion of the global crypto trading.

Some more news out of South Korea about ICOs...
@_date: 2018-06-12 04:31:17
Got some more awesome news from South Korea about the Coinrail fiasco...
@_date: 2018-06-10 06:09:06
why why why
@_date: 2018-06-07 02:19:10
Korean exchanges starting to feel the heat. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:25:35
two distractions on either side
@_date: 2019-01-01 06:26:14
lol nailed it
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:42:54
thanks for that imagery... not that I was sleeping at all before but that certainly isn't helping

Saw some interesting stuff at a job fair today in Korea. Basically they need to fill some serious positions like computer programmer and Dapp dev, but they will only do it on a Sunday afternoon in a tiny isolated building. Then they won't pay more than $3k/month....

check the citations in the article for corroboration about their net worth. Also, just look up how much Kakao Stocks is worth. There was BIG money at this thing but you would never know it based on the third-rate presentations.

I thought Zimbabwe has been juggling that prospect for a while. The central bank there banned it amidst major public outcry a few months back.

There's really no explanation that makes sense or excuse that justifies the work culture here anymore. It's simply draconian and needs to stop. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 02:36:30
if you wrote that article, you lifted several lines straight from my article. No surprise your article came out 5 hours after mine made the rounds on the internet. I'm following you now and will call you out every time you plagiarize me. Also, wtf is up with the 'team' on your website? John Doe? I smell shit.

what's the ROI on a beer like that?

It's changed a bunch of times throughout the series. Last date I saw was from the Sarah Connor Chronicles.

But the real question is: Do they accept Bitcoin Cash?

sorry... my link didn't post with the rest of the text. Check it out...
@_date: 2018-07-11 13:50:09
I would appreciate it if you didn't steal my writing, thanks. At least cite the right source material in your article.
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:42:11
nothing wrong with poking a pizza guy for thousands of bitcoin

Good tip, but I'm a smart shopper. I am now creating a new wallet address just for buying booze tonight to avoid funny stuff in a faraway land where I have no chance of reprisal.
