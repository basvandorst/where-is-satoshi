Yeah, I think people would consider it pretty fishy if they withdrew money from the address before the bidding was complete.

Except by using bitcoin, the auctioner has to have $100 to actually bid, first.

Or they just have to succeed in an attack that will net more profits than their business will.

Has Google hinted at whether the Nexus line will be promoted to the Android silver line? I was worried about buying one as I figured they would become second class citizens to Google as the new silver phones come out.

We can't go to the moon if bitcoin doesn't first. No need to try to make arguments with bitcoin. Not to mention is a very limited number of bitcoins users where is a very large percent of dogecoin users.

If your credit card expires you are SOL unless you get a new card or number. I've contacted support and they just fed me some line about how credit cards are "in beta". Seriously how does my credit card number become permanently invalid because it expired?
If it's really a big deal just go manually remove my card from the invalid list.
    Delete from InvalidCreditCards where AccountNumber = xxxxx;
I am a wizard.

They get all your traffic. Which "should" be encrypted, but combination of bad websites, and things like OpenSSL bugs, I would be cautious of exit nodes.

Do you really think everyone running TOR nodes are nice normal people? Private party running nodes could have as much to gain as the NSA

False. Doge is based on fun.
Fun doesn't die.
Dogecoin isn't going anywhere despite harsh criticism.

His point is that in 500 years we will probably learn a thing or two.
