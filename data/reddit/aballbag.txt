@_date: 2018-01-23 07:42:03
One commentator (always suspicious of lone 'whistleblowers') is speculating that Bitfinex is lending the proceeds to big traders to pump the BTC price on that exchange. Hence the audience of traders.
All this wild speculation could easily be stopped by Bitfinex 'showing us the money' that is supposedly backing USDT. Where is the audit ?
Shame they haven't because there is so much technical good news associated with BTC technological development that the price should be mooning. 
This is being missed by the general crypto investor.
Remember the old saying ... "the market can remain irrational far longer than you can remain solvent."

Sorry for my ignorance, but can you confirm my understanding:
1. Coinbase is a 'market maker' for bitcoin buy/sells with US$ only. This is the entry/exit point from fiat into the crypto world.
2. GDAX is an associated site that is a market place for crypto traders in general and the exchange is merely a facilitator introducing buyers and sellers between crypto currencies only.
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:20:52
Big dips still test my resolve.
However, volume has almost halved and price is holding up.
This suggests weak handed speculators have finally bailed out and there is no shortage of buyers hanging around for opportunities.
Hence I don't feel too threatened ATM.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:32:17
If all USDT instantly became worthless then there would be a significant dip.
But if USDT became worthless, would this trigger a bitfinex collapse ? That could cause a lasting crypto recession like Mt Gox.
I just don't know enough about the backers of USDT to evaluate the risk.

Doesn't bitfinex permit a direct transfer of a crypto balance to another exchange wallet without going via tether ?
I thought tether was for people to peg their holdings to USD without having to go through the costly process of moving to fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:46:26
As I understand it, Bitfinex is not redeeming their USDT and so holders must play pass-the-parcel by finding another speculator (mug) to unload on.
This transfer friction causes price discrepancies.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:52:25
$1.6bn USDT compared to $189bn BTC market cap does not look like a big risk ... but:
1) Market cap is a very unreliable measure of value, being dependant on the price of the last few trades. Market sentiment is very volatile ATM.
2) USDT is issued by Bitfinex, a technically insolvent exchange that accounts for more than half the total world trade volume according to Worldcoinindex. Failure of Bitfinex is a much bigger risk IMO.
Having said that, I am holding and intending to buy more if a big enough dip overcomes my conservative mood ATM.
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:43:51
Ummmm ... its not a safe.
So keep it in a safe.
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:31:18
Bitfinex is prepared to sell USDT at 1:1
However, it is not redeeming USDT atm and they suggest holders trade them on other exchanges if they want to unload.
Someone without a Bitfinex account might pay a slight premium to buy USDT from a trader on their own existing exchange rather than wear the cost and hassle of opening a Bitfinex account and transferring funds. The premium of course is limited because there is a 1:1 price on Bitfinex issues.
This might happen in a bear market when someone wishes to hedge against the US$ without the cost of going to fiat.
However, when there are a lot of people wishing to unload their USDT, their only option is to sell on other exchanges and the price may dip below 1US$ because there is no 1:1 backing on redemption by Bitfinex to peg the redemption price.
That is my understanding anyway.

At least the Bitshares counterparty risk is the network and not just the issuer like Bitfinex. 
I am not promoting Bishares, but I like the quote regarding price stable currencies from that site:
"The traditional approach to creating a stable asset is to accept deposits and issue a digital token as a claim receipt. Under this approach, the token is valued by the market as a dollar, discounted by any credit risk associated with the issuer. This can work well for transactions, but less well as a form of savings. History has repeatedly proven that issuers eventually go bankrupt due to fraud, incompetence, or government intervention."
At the moment, Bitfinex is not contractually obliged to redeem its own tokens and even if they were, there does not appear to be any independent audit that they have retained the US$ to back the token :(

@_date: 2017-12-02 22:17:21
I should also add that bitcoin was invented to bypass the financial establishment with P2P trustless transactions with control to be maintained by consensus of the people. This is partly why the establishment is hostile to bitcoin.
It also happened that bitcoin developed blockchain technology to carry out its core purpose.
However,the blockchain idea and its implementation is worthy of a nobel prize in economics.
Ironically, the "Fintech" crowd consists of bankers, financiers and entrepreneurs who are fundamentally threatened by the bitcoin P2P approach.
However, they recognise the potential of the underlying technology to streamline and speed up their own services while consolidating their own positions as "middlemen".
Hence you will see adoption of privatised blockchain technologies to enhance their product offerings.
I find it ironic that the establishment is adopting the cypherpunk technology and is now desperately recruiting these guys to help keep the old establishment alive by changing the way it operates.

This is not an article on comparison.
Bitcoin is a radically new protocol for secure P2P as well as a new database management and accounting system that companies are scrambling to adopt immediately.
Organisations are scrambling to adopt the technology to improve their existing operations, it is creating new businesses and ordinary people are becoming financially empowered.
The whole article should start out with a fundamental analysis of the differences from the dotcom boom.
Instead, it has just focused on rapid price increase without looking at the underlying which is what most mainstream financial reports seem to do.
It makes no attempt to assess risk, while at the same it talks about technical risk evaluation tools.
In this situation such tools are only useful for whatif analysis where you make speculative assumptions which could be wildly wrong. Without a fundamental look at the chances of each outcome the use is limited.
This community already wisely advises new investors to "only invest what you are prepared to lose".

Cash settled futures.
The exchange is prohibited from owning the underlying BTC to prevent manipulation. Theoretically this should reduce some volatility as the short term traders play in the futures market instead.

Just testing my limited understanding by trying to answer your question:
'Locking script' for a transaction output:
You can use another person's public address to encrypt your message (i.e. create a puzzle) such that only the person with the corresponding private key can unlock.
Once broadcast and mined, the output (amount in Satoshi) is now 'locked' to the corresponding public key and cannot be double spent by the sender ... it has become an input for the recipient.
'Unlocking' an input:
The recipient may 'unlock' this input for a transaction by supplying their corresponding public key plus a signature confirming they own the corresponding private key (without disclosing their private key).
A signature (or witness) is much more than a simple one-way hash because it enables providing proof of owning the private key without revealing it. Anyone (i.e. nodes) can verify  the supplied signature against the public key as proof that the 'spender' owns the input.

Blockchain eliminated their code as an issue.

That is the primary strategy of hedging ... limiting the downside.
This could also benefit BTC by reducing volatility and encouraging uptake by business and commerce as a payments system.

CGT and personal use assets.
If the first element of cost of a personal use asset is AU$10,000 or less then any capital gain or loss is disregarded, s.118-10 ITAA97.
The Commissioner uses a 'look-through' approach to the bitcoin transaction if all you have done is to acquire BTC in order to purchase a personal use asset costing no more than $10,000. Then any capital gain or loss on the bitcoin is also disregarded.
However, if you have purchased bitcoin as a passive investment by itself then CGT will apply. So if you hold for more than 12 months then you may be eligible for a 50% discount if a resident individual.
If the bitcoin is acquired or disposed in the ordinary course of a business or commercial profit making scheme then normal income tax applies (instead of CGT).

Looking at it from the network POV ...
The Poisson approximates to the normal distribution when average event rate gets higher ... i.e. the number of transactions arriving during the block time.
If the time to find a solution also approximates the normal distribution then we have two combined normal distributions which is a Rayleigh distribution for the number of transactions in a block ... assuming the mempool is emptied momentarily by the miner each time.

You are not supposed to be able to discover the public key from the ledger address.
That makes the ledger more resistant to attack.
You supply the public key when you create a spend transaction. The nodes then hash the supplied public key to verify there is funds (UTXOs) at the corresponding address that may be spent.

I seem to remember from counting random low rate events that probability of n occurrences in a fixed time interval followed the Poissson distribution while the time between events followed the exponential distribution.
My understanding is that miners quickly sweep up transactions from the mempool and hash these into the header before starting the puzzle solving. So new valid transactions are languishing in the mempool until the previous block has been mined PLUS the time for the new block puzzle to be solved.

BTC is an open source community driven system.
When any sub-group is unhappy with the consensus of BTC then they can fork their own version. This is the nature of altcoins and can be healthy evolution.
The real problem is when certain actors in the new group spam and sabotage and game BTC to try and achieve the flippening.

The government (and indirectly the taxpayer as its banker) would need to shoulder some blame for the following reasons:
1.  Giving preferential trading status to "too big to fail" highly leveraged banks that encourages reckless lending strategies
2.  Quantitative easing encouraging reckless borrowing and also forcing prudent investors further out on the risk curve to earn a return
3.  Reducing the physical circulation of currency and forcing people to accept payments by credits to a bank account
4.  Governments will only borrow from you if you can find the huge sum to purchase a bond and does not provide a convenient demand deposit.

The USA is one of the few with a small depositor guarantee scheme, but not every bank is covered.
Also, the European Union is quietly proposing removing their guarantee and forcing everyone into a bail-in system.

My understanding is that futures, CFDs and other products do not require purchase/sale of the underlying asset. They are speculating on derivatives.
However, indirect volatility may occur if large hedge funds want to manipulate the BTC price due to a derivative position they have taken.

2% in a day is usually noise in volatile crypto markets. Then you would look at the cumulative trend across multiple days.

If it becomes so successful that it forms a major part of your portfolio then start educating yourself about crypto &amp; fintech before selling off as a "rebalance". You want to make an informed decision.

We want btc to be a payment system first and foremost. In that case, we need merchants to trust the unit of account.
'Store of value' means preservation of capital.
If it is appreciating there is a tendency for investors to hoard and this creates a lack of liquidity for use as a currency. Fortunately at the moment the smallest denomination of 1 Sat is not a problem.
The biggest issue for merchants is volatility. If most of their acquisitions (i.e. stock purchases and bill payments) are in FIAT then they must rapidly convert sales receipts to FIAT via exchanges and they get burnt by fees.

There is some overlap.
The market rewards an investor for the time spent exposed to the risk.
A buy and hold will have a return based on the average rate. It does not matter what order the periodic market returns occur in. That is the point you were making.
A dollar cost average (accumulating cash flow) or pension (decumulation cash flow) is also exposed to sequencing risk. The results may be wildly different for different market return sequences even though the average rate is the same.
This effect is worse when the investment returns are much larger than the periodic capital inflows/outflows. It is also worse over the longer term.
Sequence risk is not rewarded by the market.

A buy and hold strategy is not affected by the sequence of market returns. It is purely rewarded for time in the market.
A dollar cost average may have a much larger variability based on the order of market returns. This  risk is not rewarded and cannot be diversified.

Nothing contentious about the SEC position.
See the accounting standards definition of a 'financial asset'.
It must be a debt or equity interest.
i.e. there must at least be rights and obligations between the issuer and holder.
Bitcoin is none of these.
Lawyers cannot decide what a 'payment' means, let alone define what is 'money'.
Don't expect any legislative breakthrough in the near future. They have been struggling for the last few hundred years with the very basic notions.

Currency need not "store value", it is primarily a medium of exchange. However, it is useful to denominate (measure) stored value in some trade-able form such as currency.
A bank account is a centralised private ledger of value stored. Usually denominated in a selected currency.
The btc blockchain is a distributed public ledger. Denominated in btc.
A bank account ledger records assets and liabilities in your chosen denomination. The only time you need currency is for transfers of value with outsiders.
A Mediaeval split tally stick recorded assets and liabilities as notches on a stick. 
Such a ledger has stored net value provided others would honour the debts owed to you or accept your credit.
The only time currency is primarily a store of value is when you choose to store the currency itself, i.e. money under the bed or hodl btc on a blockchain.
Extreme hodling is a problem with getting btc accepted by the broad community as a currency at moment because supply and demand causes wild fluctuations in value. If you leave savings in a bank account, the bank's net assets (debtors) and liabilities (savers) are set off. This frees up money for circulation.
The concept of a bank invokes ideas of centralised power, however a decentralised system is possible

Absolutely agree.
The hindrance to wider acceptance at the moment is that it is mostly being used as a store of value.
At least with banks, 'money wealth' is stored in a ledger with assets and liabilities being set off and only a small fraction of this wealth needs to be in circulation as actual money for trading.
If btc was widely accepted by traders and consumers 'on account' then the actual amount of bitcoin in existence is more than enough for global use and wild fluctuations in value would not occur.
In other words receivables and liabilities denominated in btc for commercial users at least.
Otherwise they must constantly switch back and forth with fiat to preserve the value of their business.
I guess this swapping is the problem that BITPAY is trying to address. However, a blockchain ledger with receivables and liabilities (similar to a bank ledger) would completely avoid the need for fiat.
Or somebody could start an ICO providing a btc debt factoring service for businesses to make it easy for business and commerce sales on account.
If a business was owed 100btc for sales this month and also owed its own creditors 100btc then it does not care if the value of btc swings around. Receivables are set off against liabilities.
We seem to agree that btc is an exceptional cash payment system.
However, I perceive one barrier to wide acceptance is wildly fluctuating value, partly caused by it also being largely used as a 'store of value' for investors/speculators.
Another barrier to wide acceptance is that business and commerce needs an accruals system where they can be sure that the 'cash or btc' will be eventually paid and won't wildly fluctuate in the meantime.
We can only decouple from government fiat and its manipulations when business and commerce adopt it widely. Then no party to the trade is substantially swapping in and out of fiat to lock-in value.
Look at the hassles with foreign currency hedging for a business buying/selling overseas (not a currency speculator). It is a drag on profits to protect against variations in currency values.

Bank customer (A) needs to borrow $1000 to buy goods from trader (B).
Trader (B) deposits $1000 sales proceeds in their business account with very same bank.
No cash actually leaves or enters the bank but they charge loan fees to (A).
Setting off receivables and payables (the circular IOU game) means only a fraction of the actual money held is needed by the bank. The fraction needed is any imbalance between receivables and payables. The inter-bank clearing system stops banks going insolvent.
So ... they loan shit tons more money than actually they have.
The btc ledger is 'real' as in verified bitcoin holdings.
Investing in some btc fund or depositing on an exchange that permits lending is when the circular IOU game starts and we rely on other people's credit-worthiness in the chain ... otherwise it collapses in a GFC.

However, the primary function of currency is to transfer a quantum of value for a trade.
If the Indian Government removes cash from circulation, the assets you own may still have intrinsic value but the citizens now have problems with liquidity for trade.
The direct barter system is clumsy if you want to buy a loaf of bread but the only asset you own for trade is a block of land. Then citizens will move to some other 'token' that they will accept as a small and practicable value.
This then returns to the concepts of receivables and payables on a ledger denominated in the 'token' of currency for barter. For example, they could use gold or a cryptocurrency provided they knew the other parties would accept/honour it.
Currency as a substitute for barter of underlying valuable assets then permits greater liquidity.
At the moment, btc is both the store of value and the currency. Just as if gold was the only currency but with a finite supply of appreciating value that people would prefer to accumulate rather than use as coin.
Hence previous adoption of the gold backed currency to increase liquidity.

'Credit' is not money, it is a circuit of IOU's.
Fractional reserving is a requirement that banks at least have some real money in reserve to cope with the mismatch between receivables and payables in that IOU circuit.
However, much business and commerce also provides 'trade credit' or financial accommodation by permitting deferred payment by debtors. However, their IOU circuit may be completed by being allowed payment terms by their suppliers.
It is this latter category, rather than banks, that I am interested in.
If we can accommodate the needs of ordinary business and commerce then banks will have to adapt.

Aside from the gearing problems of fractional reserving ... there is a more fundamental problem.
For widespread business and commerce adoption, there must be facilities for sales and purchases on account.
At the moment, btc is a cash payment system. P2P crypto loans is still a clumsy method for large volume business.
Also the wildly fluctuating btc value means the business must either hedge or constantly switch with fiat to lock in value.
We still need some sort of convenient debt factoring intermediary who takes on all this risk and collection.

There is precisely the problem.
If person B deposits the money in a different bank then the overnight bank clearing system sets off bank shortfalls and surpluses.
But if B stashes the cash under the bed then we have a liquidity crisis unless the government prints more money and creates inflation as an incentive to not stash it.
Or governments could limit the supply of cash to force people to store their wealth on a bank ledger (see India). This lends itself to government control of spending and also taxing. In some countries they even have negative interest rates !
However, one problem with wide acceptance of btc as money is that it is also heavily stashed as a store of wealth and causes wild value fluctuations.

Sadly trade credit accounts for a lot of economic activity.
e.g. if a business has an inventory turns of 30 days and also is given credit terms of 30 days by the supplier then the business can double its economic activity.
But there is nothing to stop a crypto intermediary from dealing in btc denominated trade debts other than the difficulty in enforcing debt payments.
If the trustless btc payments system limits all trades to an ebay/amazon cash-up-front system then mainstream business will be slower to adopt for anything other than online retail.

Bank lent A $1000 at interest.
A paid B
B deposits $1000 with bank
Net cash flow zero. In fact, if the transactions are made by bank transfers then no cash is involved in the first place. It is just numbers moving on a ledger.
Bank charges A (debtor) serious interest.
Bank 'pays' B (creditor) paltry interest by crediting their deposit account.
Bank earns interest on lending, when it actually has no money.
Setting off receivables and payables is a wonderful game until the music stops and somebody wants to see the cash.

Fractional reserving is just keeping a reserve to cover mismatch between receivables and payables (self-clearing).
At the moment, btc is a pure cash payments system, i.e. merely currency. Also the value fluctuates wildly.
Sure you could do P2P loans on the ethereum ledger.
However, for widespread adoption by business and commerce you need high volume sales and purchases on account (i.e. credit terms).
1) They don't want to have to hedge currency fluctuations or constantly convert to fiat to lock-in value
2) They don't want to have to run their own clearing and reserving in this currency
So some intermediary would need to perform this function. This could be a combination of debt factoring and/or lending.
Traditionally this role has been performed by banks ... but we know they have a habit of taking over control and then the price gouging, political interference and piss poor service begins.
