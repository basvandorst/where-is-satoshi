I don’t get how this isn’t bigger news on here.... 50 went big with his last album on bitcoin and now it’s paid off and he’s just come public with it. He’s a hodler 
How is he not embraced?

Haha ok you got me, vitamin water really isn’t good for you it’s just sugar water.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:33:30
... how?? He did it 4 years ago and made big. If this was Steve Wozniak or some nerdy white dude would you say that?
He’s an extremely accomplished investor (ever heard of vitamin water?) So it’s vey much within his lane. 
Yes, there’s gonna be a press release, considering he’s been one of the most famous people in  music for over ten years.

This^^^ vitamin water sold to coke for billions
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:30:29
Lol why does everyone have negative views about 50 here like this? He does support bitcoin he did this shit back in 2014. He’s actually an investor and an artist though so he doesn’t just spend his time on reddit all day
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:28:47
He didn’t, why would you assume that? He’s an extremely accomplished investor outside of his music
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:47:58
Lots of weird underhanded comments on here about this, I was actually real excited to see this news last night. 50 was one of my favorite artists as a kid and still a top one for me.
He’s an accomplished investor, glaceau(vitamin water) sold to coke for over 4 billion. He made a money move with bitcoin 4 years ago (when bitcoin was like $600) and has finally come public about it. 
Why does everyone assume the worst out of him? Tbh something tells me there’s a strong prejudicial response from people who from the outside looking in see someone who makes “stupid” music for “thugs”
Read about his life story, he actually did a book with Robert Greene that I loved that’s part autobiographical. It’s amazing what this man has went through to get to where he is. And on top of that he obviously supports and brings further notoriety and attention to crypto.
And to any haters, lol he’s already done more for crypto and has more btc than you ever will lol. Stay hatin ��
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:41:42
He does. Lol are you racist? I hate to just jump there but what’s with the hate. He supports bitcoin, more than anyone else on this board he’s touched a lot more of it and actually made a money move with it that mattered and brought more attention to crypto.
But he’s a shill apparently

No idea why you got downvotes this is probably true. Plenty of hip hop elite are getting in now. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:36:04
He didn’t though that’s the point he invested
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:34:46
Lol do you think that’s small game? Glaceau was bought by coke for billions....

He is right though, this is like arguing for serfdom. We live in a service based economy there’s no way currency would go back to being backed by commodities, unless there’s an apocalypse or some crazy shit

not in my state yet..
@_date: 2018-09-26 08:58:34
Just putting it out there Ray dalio is dope but he thinks bitcoin is retarded
@_date: 2018-09-26 08:58:06
This dude also said bitcoin is shit
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:29:01
Sorry for being clueless, but how is this relevant to my stake in bitcoin? Not trying to be a smartass
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:33:19
Gemini ain’t available in AZ yet... I got an Airbitz wallet tho. Anything else I can do?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:36:10
Alright I usually hate these types of posts on reddit, but this was actually clever.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:15:57
None of those points are of contention. Roger ver has explicitly stated that he engineers his website and app to get people to buy bitcoin cash thinking that it is bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:02:14
Lol I’m not even really offended by Bcash or anything but yeah I actually found out about by a friend trying to become involved and duped by the name. It basically preys on ignorance and misinformation. If it really holds water it could do so without borrowing names in order sew confusion.
