I'm seeing this everywhere lately, along with this retarded meme of "ok boomer". It's getting annoying indeed...  
Plus, arn't baby boomers in their 70s now and losing relevance most of them being retired?   
Yet it seems to be used in pretty much any context.
I guess its just a consequence of the spreading ideology of radicalized communitarianism in the west.   
Gender wars, Race wars, political team wars, and now generation wars. Everyone must be in their 'team' against all the others...

Except apart from the fact this asteroid is made mostly of metal (and likely iron and nickel), everything else is pure speculation.   
The number of 700 quintillion is based on the price of iron and nickel and the volume of the asteroid.
So nope, there is no "infinite supply of gold" because there is no proof of it containing any gold.

Indeed, its really interesting news!
However, I could be wrong but as far as i know no deposit insurance ever covers crypto (same as for FDIC insured coinbase).  
So for example if you plan to have an account with 90% bitcoin where you're only converting it little by little to € as you use it,  it means most of your balance isn't covered by the insurance.

I'm actually searching where to settle down in Europe these days, so count me in! :D
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:21:32
I see! However nothing was telling me my post had been 'deleted' which is a bit confusing!
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:53:53
Yes it's pretty compelling.
But here what i was trying to assess is the influence of Blockstream that BCH supporters claim to be huge in the same way.
Officially nobody is in charge, but if the most famous and respected devs all belong to this company, can we really expect a change being made to bitcoin without their approval ?
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:00:14
Is it just a minority of these devs that belong to this company then? 
Its hard to get an idea of the level of influence it has. THis kind of thing is never easy to evaluate. Is there any facts or stats that debunk the " all the main devs are now working for them" argument ?
Also i understand officially nobody is in charge, its like a group decision. But as it is the case for every group of humans, there's always a natural hierarchy and dominant members that will end up beeing the ones deciding while others follow. 
As an example, if as you say Adam Black is a famous and respected dev of bitcoin, can we imagine a scenario where something would get done without his approval?

i don't see it as "removed"... but thanks i guess i have my answer! If a mod removed it , he did it in less than 5 seconds :p
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:40:43
Thanks! 
Yes i've watched it already the other day as it was made a sticky on this subreddit. 
Antonpoulous is indeed convincing and explains things very well. This logic of scaling makes sense.
But to me it seems to be a different topic than the concern of 'centralization' of bitcoin by a single company which could influence things for its own interests in the future ( though I didn't know about Adam Black, it is a reassuring 'flag' ).
Isn't it what's already happening on the other side where BCH is partly the result of a powerful miner who wanted to influence things to keep his patented mining 'exploit' in place, and pushing for bigger blocks to pave the way for more mining centralization in the future?
I am really seduced by the ideal of a decentralized system. But my knowledge of history and human nature tells me otherwise.
I do worry that all this is/could/will eventually boil down to 2 different factions each one fighting for leadership and accusing the other one to be the one "centralizing" while denying its own motives.

Of course there had to be at least one condescending answer, it wouldnt be the internet otherwise! 
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:17:38
Yes it suddenly appeared in the "new" section after 20 minuts... that's odd. :D
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:46:58
Indeed it doesnt necessarly means it. 
And that's the whole difficulty of judging this issue... 
I think you could say it would depend of the actual proportion of devs from Intel, their roles and their influence in the linux community, and if some of the last major decisions and evolutions have been still coming from teams that had nothing to do with the devs from Intel. 
So i wish i could understand better the "weight" blockstream has in the whole bitcoin development process.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:10:08
Where ?  
I checked my messages and didnt see any notification.
Was it "shadow removed" ? Is there such thing ?
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:13:30
I see. It was a question asking this subreddit their opinion about one of the main arguments of the "BCH supporters", as i couldnt find any satisfying answer to it yet. 
But yet i see plenty of talks about BCH in this sureddit all day long. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:03:00
And is there any stats or estimate about how many active core devs are related to this company ? Is it in the order of 1, 10.. 50% ? 
@_date: 2019-12-24 14:19:55
Millions dead and thousands of years of wars in the name of some bullshit glorified code-of-laws built upon our fears of mortality ?

the telegraph.... maybe there's an analogy somewhere :p

Yes, Iran... because it's such a warmongering country that's been constantly attacking its neighbors and waging war. Surely they're all preparing to trigger the 3rd world war and attempt the re-foundation of the Persian empire.
