You've basically made it so anyone else who finds themselves in your position *has* to do something like this, or else they will always know in the back of their mind that they are acting selfishly. Good work.

It’s simply posing the question, what if the future basically looks similar to the past. If that’s true, these are the implications. The fact that the best fit line seems to capture the shape of the chart well (with the exception of a few massive pump/dump cycles) is suggestive (to me at least). It also suggests that one should not buy if the chart gets way above the best fit line— if that happens, it’s likely to crash soon after, historically speaking.
Edit: added not before buy!

What happens to those futures contracts that were trading on some exchanges? I read that they were valuing he forked coin at $2,000– but now it will never exist!

Go right ahead, ideas should be free!

It wouldn’t help them in the case of bitcoin because owning a lot doesn’t allow you to change the consensus. It does let you crash the price in the short term, but that would be temporary.

It took me a long time to accumulate it as well, and also many hours of contemplation to think of the original bits. I'm always disappointed when I read descriptions of bitcoin made for non-technical readers, because they invariably resort to "hand waving arguments" instead of just explaining what is going on. And most people are in fact smart enough to understand it if they are willing to think about it for a couple hours, so it does the public a disservice that the details are always hidden from them in popular accounts.

Thanks so much! I worked super hard on it so that means a lot to me.
