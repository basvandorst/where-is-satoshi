should be able to buy with coin base with those two setup new account and don't lose your 2FA key this time write it down twice and store it once on a usb stick too when you change phone you can move your 2FA over to new device

We need more growth in the next few years there isnt enough people in the bitcoin market yet and the price will be higher the more individuals that start using it having a limited few holding large sums isn't good for bitcoin spread the word 
We do need upgrades like LN and higher segwit adoption if we carry on at this rate but that will be late 2018/2019
The more people that start to use the less volitle the market becomes and the harder bitcoin will be to governments,hackers and anything that try to dethrone bitcoin In 2018 there will be alot of this happening i.e regulations,taxing
We can do this Bitcoin will come out on top we have big names like Russel branston,bill gates jhon macfee investing in what they can see as being a very useful currency
Do not wait to buy !!! 20k could be sooner than most think mid 2018 wouldn't be an impossible target at this point people who should have been getting bitcoin the lower income family's will be priced out and will probably never own 1BTC Especially considering the next bitcoin block halving will be in 2020 things will get very interesting 
If you liked my comment please donate I will be trying to do more market analyzing for you guys and update with news and my youtube channel

ah yes bitcoin.com is bad news

I think there is a way i have seen this on reddit before with LTC BTC AND ETH someone will hopefully post a guide it is quite a complicated process i believe

I use nicehash its good you get payed in BTC but you are actually mining many different coins for other people who are paying you. Really easy for beginners to set up. AND IS THE ONLY WAY TO PROFIT WITHOUT ASIC unless you want to mine direct sell them yourself then buy btc. It works with most mining devices and CPUs
Buying coins is better If you don't mine for at least a year 24/7

buy a ledger nano s better than storing it on a pc with internet if your colleagues don't get it hacker will listen to the john McAfee speech he got hacked for some coins and he recommends hardware wallets as this is a very new space and that breeds bad behavior until it is a more widespread adoption ( DONT KEEP COINS ONLINE )

.14 in day and .7 at night so good for me :D
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:56:42
I have been thinking this all day and that is why i believe bitcoin will always be number 1 also looking past the war last few days there is a lot of good news for bitcoin

usb miner isnt going to net you anything wack 3 1070's in there then you can make a tenner a week :D

yes with right hardware at right cost for your hardware/electric cost you can profit. Even with GPU if you use nice hash although your return wont be for about 6 months with a GPU. Also factor in the price of bitcoin in years time hopefully 10k+ and then yes it is most defiantly profitable

Yes but only takes 1 miner to mine it to make it happen in which case on the 16th there will be a fork if you read my post you can clearly tell i know its been canceled that's why i said if it dose please comment with serious answers people need informed decisions based on fact
p.s there was news a group of miners are still going to go ahead all i want to do is sell and put back into bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:26:48
please explain your logic because we have money ?
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:26:20
The segwit2x split i.e b2x happening on the 16th November
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:11:27
I have still got two days before the blockchain is fully downloaded and its been running for two days :D
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:56:31
don't waste your money let them waste theirs if you believe in bitcoin,lightning network and segwit adoption all much better options than 8mb block hold on when btc recovers dont play there games
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:43:14
Are you using the gbp wallet or euro ? They only allow euro transfers if you can hang on they are bringing back gbp transfer not sure how long im having same issue right now did sepa payment but still not verified. But i don't need to withdraw at the moment hope it goes well let me know how it went ?

People you can make profit i have 4 1070s running with an i7 and amd ryzen 7 and i make about £300 a month i will make my money back 4 months for all graphics cards another 2/3 months for rest of parts i can then sell parts or keep mining this also dose not account for the price of bitcoin rising either so now i make profit even quicker YOU CAN MAKE PROFIT EASY
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:30:39
Get a chair or any large heavy object for that mattter smash them round the head with it hulk smash your chest afterwards = Job well done
P.S now you have a nice quite work space with a pile of bodies in the corner you can celebrate by watching btc hit 10k
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:09:18
You can mine if your electric is free/cheep and you have startup cash of at least enough to buy one gpu
My advice would be buy asic secondhand for about £700
I gotta say is wrong anyone can make a profit with simple math and you don't need a lot of cash to start but don't expect to get as rich as the big boys without shelling out for hardware at start Ive just spent 1.5k to make £350 back every month
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:13:22
BTW you could use the computers cpu and graphic cards to mine xmr/monreo and hope its price hikes in next few years
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:04:12
try using nice hash you are not actually mining bitcoin but you get payed in bitcoin that way you can profit run a full node as well and you are helping bitcoin 
Save for a ant miner or Avalon then you can mine bitcoin direct
