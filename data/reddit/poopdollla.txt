A fearful reaction to unsettling news is not a price correction. It's a crash from fear selling 
@_date: 2017-02-09 05:43:39
Personally i think the ETF will be approved.
However i think the price is being driven heavily by many sharing this same belief. 
I dont think denial will have a long term horrible effect but i think there will be a pretty substantial sell-off and a crash to $750-$850 and it will recover over the following few months at a slower pace then we have seen it recover from the early Jan run-up/crash.
If your hodling long i dont think there is much to worry about. I think either way 2017 will end very positive. 
I am going to load up as much as I can in the next week or 2, and if approved i think we will quickly see $2k, If denied, the second the new breaks I am smashing the sell button and rebuying everything when a clear bottom forms 
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:02:27
Hopefully this last week is a consolidation period and we are ready to break out upwards shortly. 
I really am suprised, even in light of the PBoC news, that getting so close to ETF decision that we are flat

Ty. I will look into securing my btc better tonight. I only finally finished buying the total of what I wanted yesterday (daily limits made me stretch it out). It's not my life savings on there or anything (ill say its more then 1btc less then 10 btc) but you are probably right I should be securing my investment .

Its really no different then a stock. You dont get taxed on gains until you sell. you could have bought 1000 shares at $1 and now each share is $1000, and as long as u dont sell it, you wont get taxed.
Same applies (legally atleast) once u convert your BTC into fiat 
@_date: 2017-02-09 23:20:10
Well i wouldnt really say there is any price that would make me sell immediately. More so news that, in my mind, dramatically changed its long term future value. I dont even really have an example of what could could happen that could do that, but i also dont know nearly enough about the inner workings to be able to have an example. If there was a sudden panic sell that dropped the price to even $400, $300, even that low as long as whatever caused that crash was in my opinion panic selling of a short term problem, i would still hold. I have enormous faith in the future of bitcoin, news that would make me want to sell would have to change that. But my worry is in the event of news that would change my long term faith broke, i would imagine that 48 hours later my coins would be virtually worthless, or at least like 85%-95% loss. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 00:00:29
Yeah i mean the risk of him doing that really depends on the amount. As long as you are not buying/selling through an exchange linked to your name/doing bank transfers and are only doing a couple thousand bucks your not gonna get caught. But that could be said about nearly anything. I could run a small side business off the books and also not report it and probably not get caught. But there is nothing inherent about bitcoin that makes it untaxable. Hes just choosing to not report income

@_date: 2017-02-19 17:03:54
Yes you can place holds on either individual agencies or you can put holds on all of the agencies. So if your not planning on applying for anything for awhile you could place a preventative hold. Or if someone applied as you you could place a hold to stop them from any further attempts until you get things figured out 
@_date: 2017-02-14 00:31:36
BTW, im not a huge trump supporter, nor have a said I am. I voted for Obama twice, but absolutely nothing was better then Hilary. The double standard that is being used by the left on Trump is insane, and the whole sky is falling because they didn't get there way is nothing more then a temper tantrum of false fear mongering about things that aren't gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:50:58
Not yet. Right now it's just in my btc wallet. I have a question for you about the vault. It says once it's in there it needs a confirmation from 2 emails plus a 48 hour waiting period before being able to take any out. I like the idea in terms of safety from hack, but does that mean if some game changing news came out that sends the price seriously crashing, and for example depending on what happened, potentially the long term value to be worthless, can I not sell immediately? Would I have to wait the 48 hours? I don't forsee anything like that happening, but you never know. And if in fact I couldn't react immediately in the event of such news that makes me very uncomfortable holding it there. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 01:58:42
Yeah we all know they protect the banks. "Keep current with new technologies" and "smart legislation/protections" are all just keywords for making sure bitcoin doesn't fuck with their territory. It's like if your selling drugs and move to a new neighborhood and the local dealers offer to "show you around". They aren't being friendly 
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:05:19
That makes a lot of sense. 
I'll still be over here with my fingers and toes crossed hoping for approval. 
Regardless of this decision I think we are likely to see one in the next 2 years I would think
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:49:08
I know it's not actually a big deal. Price will be back in no time at all. If anything it actually proves just how solid bitcoin in right now. To react fairly calm to a headline like this and recover quickly. 
I just wanted to make a funny meme :)
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:23:29
Yeah I agree. I hold a decent amount of physical money in a safe place because I don't even trust the banks. The government could come in and confiscate what you have in the bank if they wanted to/found a reason 
@_date: 2017-02-09 23:33:52
yeah possibly. but again im not really talking about what happens to the price. I am more concerned with what I interpret the news to mean for the future. Im not talking about countries banning it, hacks, exchanges being shut down. Im talking more about things that fundamentally would change what it is and where it is headed
@_date: 2017-02-14 00:38:11

I dont see this as good news at all. the ONLY ONLY ONLY ONLY ONLY ONLY ONLY ONLY ONLY ONLY ONLY ONLY reason that the government would EVER EVER EVER EVER get invovled is because they want their cut and to prevent us, the citizens, from using it in any way to become independent and free from their oppression.

This is why a $20/month active credit report monitoring service is soooooooooooooo worth it. When I apply for a credit card or any sort or loan, I get an alert that someone has pulled my credit typically within minutes. If anyone ever tries to steal my identity and open anything with it I will know right away and have the very best odds at stopping it 
@_date: 2017-02-15 12:44:20
Well I guess that's good then if it doesn't happen. Hopefully not to much is priced in yet so maybe we don't fall as far if denied 
@_date: 2017-02-12 14:56:40
I think you are misunderstanding "buying the dip"
Most people dont mean wait for a dip for an entry point. There is no bad time to enter bitcoin. As long as you are hodling long and believe we have much higher to go, you cant go wrong. 
When people talk about buying the dip, they are talking about adding even more when the price dips, which brings down your average cost per btc. 
Welcome to the fam. Congrats on your ticket to the moon
@_date: 2017-02-13 19:24:53
Wow there are a lot of delusional liberal tears in this thread 
@_date: 2017-02-11 02:06:15
I figured what you meant was if people think they have to buy a full btc, and know it's 1k, they don't want to spend that much to get into something they don't know much about, and therefore forget about it and never buy. 
So if it was more common knowledge, there would be more buyers. Higher demand, higher prices per btc.
@_date: 2017-02-10 23:14:50
plus that asian chick in the commercial mentioning bitcoin. All it takes is one person at each party to actually know about bitcoin. Commercial brings the topic up, now you have 10+ new people at least interested at each household where that situation played out. I got like 4 people at work today interested. I mentioned it and all the sudden they bombard me with questions. 2 of which sound like they are going to buy some. They didnt even know you could buy in fractions of a coin.
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:39:04
Exactly. I have been doing the same. The potential upside in my opinion is HUGE. The potential short term downside I believe is also pretty big. I think we could potentially initially drop up to 40% (but probably a lot less). But it will only be short term. Even with the ETF getting denied I think we absolutely end 2017 higher then we are now. So since I have no problem hodling for at least 1-2 years, there is essentially no risk/no downside because we will recover whatever we lose by the end of the year. I will probably have around 35% of my total savings in btc. Sold some stocks today to move it over even.

Ok then ask me specifically what parts of what he believes. Do I support everything he believes on every topic? Of course not. I don't align completely with any person. So if you have specific things he believes that you would like to ask then please do. What I imagine you are doing is hoping I say a broad yes then bring up some crazy off the wall shit some article claims he believes with likely little evidence and then link me to that.

It's well hidden. I'm talking actual cash. Not like holding value in the form of an asset. They would need a search warrant and to literally rip my home to shreds. I'm not saying they couldn't if they really really wanted to. But it's definitely an added layer of security then simply confiscating numbers on a screen from your bank account

Doesn't coinbase store like 99% in cold storage to avoid hack + aren't your funds insured up to like 100k? Or are you referring to my personal computer getting hacked? Since the vault requires 2 email address confirmations plus 48 hold on moving from the vault so I'd have time to see the hack and stop it?

i agree to an extent, but after reading your reply i got interested in what it is that people think will long term crash bitcoin. And i literally couldnt find any recent articles with a negative bitcoin outlook. We could also being see far more positive articles on here simply because their supply is way bigger then that of negative articles

Exactly. If you wait for the price to dip before you buy, it literally may never come. I wanted to buy for months and kept second guessing myself and thinking it may come back down. Well i could have gotten them in the 700, instead i paid over $1000. Most recently last week when it dipped to the low 900s I added some more, which averaged my overall cost per BTC down
@_date: 2017-02-11 01:49:53
I know how you feel. If you are really at 60% tho man I wouldn't worry about regretting not investing more down the line. That's a serious commitment to be making. Even tho some of us have a lot of faith, it still carries substantial risk. Idk if you have a family or what, but you can't be hard on yourself being responsible with your portfolio u know?
@_date: 2017-02-11 01:47:33
Meaning you think if it was more commonly known then the price would be higher because more people would  be buying (because they arent turned off by the idea of having to spend  $1000+?
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:07:54
maybe for polo. But as far as gdax, gemini, ect, a majority of the money flowing into ETH at least is USD. Im not saying BTC is dying or is even hurting, or that any alt is going to take it over whatever whatever, but you are kidding yourself if you dont think there is a lot of USD coming into crypto that no longer has to flow first into BTC then BTC -&gt; alt
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:33:15
