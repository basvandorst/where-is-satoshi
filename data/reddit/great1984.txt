Yes, the workflow includes making an order once the info is 'valid' and then sending a custom parameter to Coinbase. That parameter can be used to poll the invoice to see its status and also is returned on the postback and redirect to help identify the order in the database and update its status.

Good points, will add logo and referral link.

Yes, the product's information is actually database driven, so the amount for the bitcoin invoice is dynamic. Imagine instead that the page you see above is the shopping cart and the amount charged is the order total sum of all items, it's the same thing.
In the case of my implementation, it would work the same with a shopping cart full of unique items or 1 product. I generate the order and items on order, send over an order reference number to Coinbase in this case, then the callback is used to look up that ID and mark the order and all items (in this case just 1) paid.

Haven't been there in like 6 years.

This is not about a plugin, this is about working directly against Coinbase's API.

A/B testing proves that what people prefer and what converts are different. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:30:25
Yes, you are right - it's a Coinbase specific implementation. There are differences with Bitpay, for example, you can have multiple payments to an invoice from different wallets. In the case of Coinbase, you have only 1 shot at getting the correct amount on time.

There isn't a law prohibiting using real bitcoin to test but I have heard it's illegal to test with real credit cards. If bitcoin is to be taken as seriously as credit, I'd assume it would be treated the same.

-you can send to an address more than once (beyond it being for a specified amount that is associated with an invoice)
-this was about working with Coinbase's API, not a plugin but a direct integration

If you are so confident in this approach, I suggest you go to a big enterprise client that wants to accept bitcoin and get them to budget and approve (their legal department) what you are suggesting. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:24:08
The fact that a person could send more or less than the amount is the problem. 
Trying to pay in person with bitcoin also poses a problem. Once I paid at a store, they were using Bitpay as their processor, and they manually typed in the amount due for me to pay. The amount they put in was wrong, manual steps always introduce problems. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:27:23
And you did an API level integration or pasted their script into an HTML page?

Refunds are a challenge. Microsoft is not giving refunds for bitcoin transactions. That is a whole other topic though. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:33:18
Yes, with bitcoin there is no auth/capture model. Coinbase does offer a recurring billing option but that's just them:

There's no way to know something will work before it does, granted. That's the problem with science. The goal is to increase likelihood here. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:31:54
Thank you for your attention to these details! 
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:39:29
Possibly no one would make it illegal however the payment processor may have to report to the government. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:26:10
It's potentially faster to transfer the funds to a bank account. The actual confirmation is slower, yes.

Did consider Stripe because we are using it for CC transactions yet Coinbase was preferred for now. Perhaps will get around to using Stripe for bitcoin transactions as they move beyond beta. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:24:26
It's fixed.
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:08:49
It's not a best practice to use a real credit card for testing credit card integration so why is it ok with bitcoin? What if you want to run automated tests with the actual amount and not some fake amount? It's really a hack to not use testnet, you can spend real money if you want. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:12:17
The SDK I used was in C# for Coinbase (it's unofficial). I do contribute to it, I added the refunding capabilities myself:  
The same problems exist in other SDKs.

Thank you. 
It appears many people here are only using plugins, yet, even using them, there are still many edge cases. The focus here are on the exceptional cases that a merchant must know about to confidently adopt this technology for payment. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:20:10
If you click the bitcoin tab, you'll see the terms differ. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:08:52
Coinbase has a decent API and most of the issues addressed are applicable to Bitpay too. 
Time Inc. uses Coinbase they are a decent size company.

First of all, it's at most $69.90 if you use credit. There are people who cheat the system and end up only paying $9.95 by cancelling their card. It's a risk for merchants to not collect full payment quickly, look at things from the other side for a better perspective.

This isn't about a plugin, it's surprising how far people think they can get with plugins alone (granted, often pretty far). What if you want to actually make a plugin or your requirements don't work with an off-the-shelf solution? The issues I'm addressing are lower level. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:58:26
Thanks. Have been following them, haven't seen a date for it yet. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:52:44
I assure you, using a different processor you will still run into almost all of these issues.
@_date: 2015-02-19 06:37:00
I'm not suggesting this is good UI. It would be nice to have a way, if only as a 'see more details' type of thing to know what the initial amount you received was worth.
When I send/ receive bitcoin, I have no way of knowing through the app I use what the amount was worth at the time it was sent/ received. Personally I'm curious if each transaction I made went up or down in value. To me, this gives people a reason to constantly immerse themselves in bitcoin transactions. Each time you send or receive bitcoin, it's a type of investment.
