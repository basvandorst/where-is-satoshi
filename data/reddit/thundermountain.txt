I’ve been on reddit for awhile and gaming for half my life. Many of these communities are toxic to women. If I was a woman I wouldn’t want to put up with that. It’s not me it’s you.

Something very similar happened with doge awhile ago to online wallets. When people made transactions the exploit altered the amount and the address it was getting sent to right when you hit the send button on the webpage. Is this similar?
Can you ELI5 why disabling Java script would bypass this problem?

Here's what it would likely fall under. Does anyone have an idea of where this person is located, we can at least report the crime, even if we haven't figured out who it is. If they are located in the USA, it's a felony to the best of my knowledge.

The twitter attached is located is listed as TX. I don't have much experience, but we have to file a relevant police report in the next 24 hours or so, in order for this to possibly open a criminal investigation. We will likely get laughed at, but it's worth a shot.
