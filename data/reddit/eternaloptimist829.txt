I didn't realize Finland no longer exists lol but yeah IDK what they were thinking with that flag design lol
@_date: 2016-10-13 15:56:58
You really need to study Finnish history if you think you can label them as an Axis power like that.
I'm just going to stop there.  It's not about the flag it's about the actions that flag has taken.

Ok if you don't see the difference between the flags flown over failed imperialistic nations and the ones flown over a peacetime Air Force from one of the most Democratic nations in the world, then no amount of explanation is going to help you.

The rule is if the nation still exists then it's accepted.  This means no confederate flag, no imperial Japanese flag, no Nazi flag.
You don't have to agree but the rule always seemed kind of obvious to me.

Ok man just remember a lot of folks disagree with you.  And if you really can't understand how a flag can be offensive then I'd guess your general lack of understanding towards sensitive issues is probably going to end up offending a lot of people in your life (hopefully not anyone too important).
It's about empathy for people who are offended...caring about people who say, "Hey that really bothers me," even though you don't agree.   I've heard a lot concerning the Imperial flag, enough that I no longer feel like it's just a piece of fabric for a lot of folks, even if it is to me.

Maybe I'm being a SJW but do we really need the imperial flag?  Can't we just let it go?

There's also still confederate flags on state flags in the US, doesn't make it right for 2016.
Just because something is still happening from 65 years ago doesn't make it right in the here and now.

Ok I'll do my best to stay open-minded but don't be surprised when someone doesn't like either one...

It's kind of bitcoins fault for saying,  "Hey lets create a currency the government can't track."  Not really anyone's fault I guess just expected that they're going to get fucked if the people know they can't be traced.

As a consumer my issue with this whole experience of bitcoin is I don't *want* to buy anything online without the ability to do a chargeback and get a refund if I need to.  Using currency without the ability to charge back is a liability to a buyer because it offers me no protection (why I never use cash).  So what's my incentive to use bitcoin for someone like Amazon when my CC offers two levels of refunding?
Bitcoin is obviously designed to protect the vendor using it and for "high security" transactions and not at all set up to be easy for the consumer IMO.  I can't think of any reason I would ever want to use this unless I was trying to buy/sell something illegal or to buy shit using said "dirty" money I shouldn't put in a bank, which is why it doesn't surprise me at all the value is so volatile.  Like if I were a drug dealer this shit would be the best thing ever.  As a guy trying to live day to day, it's just not for me.

It's genetic, I was born into it.
@_date: 2015-02-19 10:14:18
Yes but not to get bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-19 10:08:23
OK so here's a question.  I need to buy something that costs $26 and the merchant takes bitcoin.  I have to wait four days before it's deposited to my wallet but the price of bitcoin is volatile.  If I get $26 worth of bitcoin tonight, I have to wait until Wednesday to actually buy it (at least that's the message coinbase gave me) and by then it may not be $26 anymore.  So how do I know it will still be enough?  How much should I get to make sure?

Yeah and they want ID and all this other stuff when I try to use Paypal.  None of them take a CC so I don't know how to get instant coins on there.  Everything makes you wait a day or isn't available for all hours.  I don't understand this.  It's like they don't want my money, it's kind of crazy.
Edit:  Yeah every one on localbitcoins says either don't bother unless you've been registered for a few months, have history and all this or to show an ID or something.  I don't understand why I can't just do this simple thing.  Is there not a legit company that will give you bitcoins with a CC?  If so why not?  Why do I have to buy them from someone else just to get them instantly?  I mean if they want Bitcoin to be popular it would help if I could buy it using normal, popular online payment methods.
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:16:34
But if I'm wanting to buy bitcoins anonymously doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose?  I feel like this whole process just reaffirms why all other forms of electronic payments have the ability to chargeback.
I guess I was expecting this to be like online cash bu tit's not like online cash at all.
@_date: 2015-02-19 10:16:11
Is there a reason banks don't offer this service for their customers?
@_date: 2015-02-19 09:49:19
Yeah I gave up.  There's just no way for me to get instant coin without having a true credit card (no debit or gift card) and bank account.
I mean I'm irritated but I get it.  Both CCs and Paypal allow for chargebacks which doesn't work when you're essentially selling online cash.  But I don't want to keep a lot of money as bitcoin with how volatile it is either.  So I shouldn't just keep money in my wallet yet it takes a few days to put money in it.  Just frustrating.
In all honesty I thought this would be a lot less involved than this.  I also don't understand why it takes Coinbase four days to withdraw money from my account when I can give them my debit card also.
