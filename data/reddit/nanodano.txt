Then I'm not sure why the jump from 400 to 600 is so excited, because it was up to 1200 at one point?

I wouldn't call someone who bought at $400 an early adopter.

Ok. What are rounds? What are shares? What is the difference between "difficulty of work returned to pool" rather than "the difficulty of work served by pool?"
