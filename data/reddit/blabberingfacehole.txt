I dunno, fed is trapped. Nobody doubts crypto now. Gold is a limp dick and war with 3 super powers is days away.
Crypto could exit the solar system.

Since Bitcoin is the worst coin technically, which alt will explode out of the gate when the dumb money has finished feeding the longs?
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:23:15

The U.S.A. Just sent an aircraft carrier to the straight of Hormuz. Bitcoin is starting to go crazy and china refuses to stop buying Iranian oil.
