Do you know if it’s possible to have short/downward exposure using bakkt?

It’s funny because this shit happens almost every year yet the market still shits its pants. Makes me think it’s not even related to the price action we are seeing.

Okay buddy

In the simplest terms it’s censorship resistant currency which means no one in the world is able to stop you from sending or receiving bitcoin. If you store your bitcoin correctly it’s also impossible to be seized/taken away by any gov/police agency. 
Exchanges are 3rd party organisations that allow the depositing, trading/purchasing and withdrawal of bitcoin. Exchanges are the main way to deposit fiat currency (usd, eur, gbp) and buy bitcoin with. Once bought you can then withdraw the bitcoin to your own wallet not controlled by any 3rd party.

If you say so, truthteller...

Sell now and forget all about bitcoin until you hear about bitcoin breaking 50k on Facebook or the news ~5 years later and hate yourself for selling at what seems like a bargain price

The fact that people used to refer to Ver as ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ is the funniest shit

Would be very surprised to see 6k break again. But then again this is a very surprising market.

Bitmex testnet is good if you want to practice with using leverage
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:45:11
And then maybe once it reaches 0 it can go down another 7k to -7k ��

Supply of bitcoin will decrease with every halving in block reward so if demand stays the same forever then it’s impossible not to eventually reach new highs imo

Like I said you buy bitcoin on exchanges. You can also buy bitcoin from a person with something like localbitcoin.
Don’t think of it like a stock though. Stocks are shares in a company and bitcoin isn’t a company. It’s better to think of bitcoin as a foreign currency or the currency of the internet.
The old pizza story is a classic in bitcoin because back then 1 bitcoin costed less than $2 and now 1 bitcoin is around $9000.

One time I got scammed by Elon musk because he said if you send him 1 Eth he will send 10 back but he didn’t reply to me ever again after I sent it. I hope he replies when he’s less busy with Tesla and getting to Mars :(

Just blame China and move on
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:15:11
Care to elaborate on that thought?
@_date: 2019-11-25 13:04:09
Always blame China

Obviously when I say supply I’m not meaning total coins ever mined. “Dumbass”

Use Revolut as a middle man bank account. If that gets closed then who cares it’s not your main bank account.

I’ve got a question about the scaling debate of bitcoin. Some people argue that raising the block size can cause an increase in centralization due to the block chain growing in size faster as each block takes up more storage space. This means it could be more expensive to run a node? The hard drives we can buy today are a lot cheaper, faster and higher storage than the ones we had years ago when bitcoin started so this doesn’t seem like a valid argument.

What do you mean about tether causing havoc on real world markets?
@_date: 2019-12-30 19:09:44
All the ones I’ve found charge way too much though, I know they need to make a profit somehow but the ones I found are all around $1000 over spot price. Maybe that’s just the price to pay for anonymous BTC.

If satoshis wallet/addresses ever got hacked then so could anyone else’s address so bitcoin would be worthless in this case. And imo I don’t think satoshis coins will ever move because he/they most likely destroyed the private keys not long after they were made.
