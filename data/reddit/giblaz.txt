So only 1/5th of American's. 
Yeah, $500k is a fucking ton. 4/5th of American households don't have that.

Oh my fucking god I hope you're trolling, laughable stance otherwise.

You are gonna get downvoted because this is but you are completely spot on. Worst of all, these other cryptocurrencies are faster and cheaper along with being limited. They're superior technologies. Bitcoin being worth anything is nothing more than an anomaly at this point.

Insulting and ad-hominem don't increase the value of BTC... it's coming down because it has no fundamentals bro. I hope you're diversified.
I did buy Bitcoin a while ago it went up a lot. Then after a while of holding it, I realized it's a bad cryptocurrency compared to literally every other coin and sold it for other better ones that have outperformed it. I'm more salty about not getting Ethereum early, which is an actual useful cryptocurrency compared to Bitcoin.

wow 83 entire restaurants let's drive 2 hours to get food and pay a $10 transaction fee on top of dinner, so convenient

Bitfinex (which employs most of Tether's employees as well) make $300 million a DAY in transaction fees.
If Tether is audited, there's just as much of a chance they're solvent as they are insolvent.
I used to think Tether is a scam, but I'm starting to think it's legit and they might actually have the money.

It's not Warren Buffet's fault he talks about it.
Everyone, I mean everyone, asks the man for his opinion on Bitcoin. Worst of all, most of the people asking him about it don't know the first thing about blockchain or Bitcoin, and neither does he. It's the blind leading the blind.
So don't get mad at Warren. Get mad at everyone for asking him instead of cryptocurrency experts (blockchain focused computer scientists and gen0 investors).

I agree with you that Bitcoin = serious political power. I just hope the US government makes itself fully understand the technology and how it can be useful to the the world society as a whole and not just come up with an arbitrary list of negatives it perceives from the technology.

There's a difference between telling someone what you're thinking of doing and getting their feedback vs. having someone be your personal gatekeeper. Which is what a lot of wives end up being for their husbands.

Hah, that's cute, thinking they wont retroactively enforce it even though morally and legally they're not supposed to. I also wish it was like that.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:09:29
Never mess with the IRS.
It's not a joke or a meme. Their job is to make sure you pay your dues and they will take every legal action to make sure you do. Unless you want to get penalties, pay on your crypto gains.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:02:05
Right. You may set a precedent for future cases, but the courts aren't going to be so keen to make their government constituents give you back your stuff.

Seriously, that's the worst part about this whole thing. Lightning Network is already tested and working on the Bitcoin mainnet. I swear if this Bitcoin Cash launch happened a month later to Coinbase, absolutely none of this would have happened.

If cryptocurrency is an inevitable technology, then one would quickly realize that being in control of it from the beginning puts the creator in an incredible position of power.
If the US government owns Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin address, then they are sitting on 1.2 million coins (including those retrieved from the Mtgox investigation).
If the world buys into crypto, they would not only have a dominance in fiat but also in crypto.
That gives them incredible financial power that no other nation has.

Just don't put a lot in. You'll lose it for sure.

I wish. All my BTC was on exchanges that didn't give equivalent amount of BCH :(.
I've spent money for the equivalent of 2 BTC in the past 3 months, and managed to lose about .8 of a BTC through alt coin trades... and I'm still ahead in USD. Long live BTC.
Pretty much just HODLing BTC from here on out.

Just because Wikileaks went hard on the corrupt politician who almost won the election doesn't mean they are anti-American.
Wikileaks holds strong traditional and fundamental American values like transparency and honesty. They expose corrupt politicians when no one else will. They are pro-America.
You may think you're right about this but you couldn't be more wrong.

The most dirt they had were from insiders who knew about Hillary's corruption from the inside. Trump literally airs his bad behavior out on Twitter / CNN / Fox so there's practically nothing left for them to "expose". Trump doesn't work from the shadows - he's not cunning enough to do that. Hillary? She is the epitome of a shadow operator. Why do you think people get hot and bothered that she speaks at closed door meetings to big time bankers and executives? She's certainly one to hold back information as long as it helps her get her way. WikiLeaks is built to destroy that kind of political behavior.
Wikileaks had far more to expose Hillary on than Trump even though the media of the USA was going easy on her. WikiLeaks will always counter the narrative. They are incredibly important as a check and balance on the media itself.

Hahahaha I love how if something is "possible", there is a certain section of the human population that calls it "simple".
Like, traveling at the speed of light is possible and they'd more than likely also call it "simple" as well.

Seriously, I remember reading his books about how to survive in the workplace when I was 13 (30 now) and even back then I thought his writing was mind opening and brilliant. I don't care for his politics too much but I'm not one to throw out the baby with the bathwater - he's truly a guy worth listening to.
