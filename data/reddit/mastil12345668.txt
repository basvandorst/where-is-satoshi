@_date: 2016-08-07 06:53:51
i think its possible to make it work but with some compromises ie settlement periods... it wont be as fast as its now but it can be pretty decent.
i think its possible:
Exchange mode: Shared keys cust, finex, arbitrer.
Margin mode: Only cold storage as those bitcoins should not be moving anywhere.
Funding mode: Cold Storage only.
Withdrawals: Shared keys cust, finex, arbitrer.

10 - 20 % of recovered funds is very reasonable :D

Hey zanetackett, thanks for keeping us informed.
question: would losses be socialized across different wallets ? as in pay the losses with USD held in bitfinex from other customers ? or is that 100% out of the question ?
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:57:33
no, he is not saying that, i believe what he is saying is for miners to not confirm those transactions, at least if i understand correctly

Hey, complain to apple, they are liable if they are approving scam apps... its not so hard to notice that it has the exact same name as another app...

the colateral of those who bought BTC should be there as well if the margin provided to them is, its the colateral provided to us funders
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:00:24
Above i did a second question which you probably didnt see, so i rewrite it now.
Assuming that the leaning position is still to count as funds margin providers of USD to buy BTC, plus BTC holders, it would be fair to involve as well the colateral of the margin BTC traders, even if its not BTC or USD... because after all their colateral is the security of our funding.
if that position is still the one being handled, USD margin providers, Traders holding BTC or margin BTC, plus their colaterals into the equation
let me know
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:58:01


i got my 23% haircut or so, assumed my loss leave finex for good.
specially since they charged me to sell their shitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:01:45
Like Chaos said, recovering a part in weeks is the best, 36% at chance of getting it back i think its fair, and the coin will be tradable, someone will buy, you can sell at maybe 70% of the price, and then the loss is much more reasonable.
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:52:40
"You're talking about something like Bitsquare. A decentralized bitcoin exchange with arbitration." 
if bitsquare is one of those system where seller and buyer are matched and then deposit made to seller by the buyer then its not what bitfinex is.
"Even in the 3/3 setup, if 2/3 is necessary to spend, this hack may have not been prevented since both Bitgo and Bitfinex signed off on it." 
in the current setup finex holds 2 keys and bitgo holds 1, and for speedy purposes bitgo has algorithms for automatic signing, and THATS the problem.
im talking about bitgo NOT signing automatically, but you sign when you withdraw plus bitfinex signs, this would work for any withdrawal just fine.
the second part is what happens with internal movements meaning buying and selling, the settlement doesnt have to be instantaneous, it could be once a day with someone watching what is happening in the screen coordinated with Bitgo so they know they can sign because of settlement.
as you say, your collateral when margin trading stays in cold storage.
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:49:11
Clever, make sure they fine them for the reminder of their capital so then you get nothing xD
@_date: 2016-08-12 11:55:14

@_date: 2016-08-03 12:35:01
we are no longer paying a % of the interests ? i was pretty sure that was part of the deal when lending, that our funds were protected
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:03:43
i mega assure you, someone :D will start slow and it will pick up....
if they make a transparent and powerful security system, i would be ok with staying actually.
i want to hold 1 key, Bitgo 1 key, Bitfinex 1 key.
when withdrawing, bitfinex signs first, then i sign directly in a bitcoin client.
Bitgo or the equivalent only signs as arbitrer 
@_date: 2016-08-09 06:34:48
in this case bitcoins fungibility will bite; so its more akin to bank accounts where you have your own, and i have my own, but the money is not there... 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:53:47
Zane, question, is colateral of the margin traders affected (BTC) gonna be affected if its USD ?
@_date: 2016-08-08 06:27:13

This,  
Basically when you have too much to earn, its easy to do it AND pretty sure nothing will happen to you = lots of corruption, the good guys will have reasons, i will do it for the good of my people, soon enough the person is being mega corrupt.  
Like Alfred said, you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.  
then you can play with the equation, lots of risks, lots of opportunity  but little gain.  
of course take it with salt.
@_date: 2018-09-22 03:23:36


Incentive + opportunity - Risk = corruption level   
Socialism because it it gives the power of whole industries to one or two people to decide with very bad oversight breeds corruption, thats why there has never been a functioning socialist state.  
if there barely is food and you are in charge to deliver truckloads of foods, then you sell it in black market and tell you gave it.  
Of course corruption is not only a Socialist issue  
where ever there big enough government intervention will provide opportunity,  
where ever getting shit done is hard enough will provide incentive as people try to bypass it  
the whole point of socialism is to replace the old elite with a new political elite that reaps the benefits, so risks are very low if you are aligned with government
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:06:29
Exactly, the idea is to consider what would most do under the given circumstances and to know what are the odds of corruption happening and whats its damage to society
@_date: 2015-12-19 13:10:58
if you are new to trading, i advice you against margin, margin is food for whales
@_date: 2015-12-24 10:09:01
Coinbase is incredibly slow, my uncle took 5 days to receive his cash and it was national deposit xD, he had to buy 100 usd higher :D.
use bitfinex, or uphold, or kraken if you have euros.
buy your bitcoins and if you dont need to hedge/trade to lower the  price of your coins, just send them to a wallet, trezor is a great option, but if you like free things and have no problems learning, google how to make a cold storage, if you download premade OS for cold storage, ask first if that one is ok.
@_date: 2018-09-11 11:50:25
i really hope it ipos, i will short it harder than snapchap, freee moooneeyy
@_date: 2015-12-02 13:30:45
What i meant was if you dont cover partial investment when there is a big boom, because this lowers your average entry price, not dumping all your btc, but to reduce stash so that the avg buy price is lower.
This way its harder for you to be at a loss in the future
@_date: 2015-12-02 14:33:06
Again, its not guessing the top, its taking profit when and if its worth it, there is no timing about it even, that they of the month you add to your stash, calculate your average price pick a profit number that fits you, set an alarm and wait for either alarm or next month when you readjust.
@_date: 2018-09-23 06:00:10
when building systems you should be thinking on something similar to this, because corruption is human nature, like fucking, you can fight it back, but with enough temptation there is very little you can do.  
when computer govern us thou, that will be different stuff, i believe then we will lean more towards socialism (and we have been last 20 years, since we are able to make better calculations and models) 
@_date: 2015-12-02 13:44:49
In other words if you have 100 btc at 340 avg price and suddenly price goes to 500, selling the profit only is a good strategy the profit if selling at 480 is 14k which is around 29 btc, you still have a large bitcoin stash but now your average price is like 280 instead of 340; at this point you have 2 options look for another undevalued assets and buy 14k worth of them, or simply wait, if btc mega moons you are still rich and if bitcoin dumps you will have more than before, its a win win scenario.
Of course this works only when the peice increase is really big like last month, the smaller the increase the bigger the risk

@_date: 2015-12-03 07:23:37
Its more of a complementary strategy. I normally buy overtime as they do, but with 75% profit i sell only the profit and reconsider options, anyway whatever suits you. We are now in uptrend so you will be ok

You didnt take partial profit at 500? I would have/did and rebought a few daya later
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:40:01


you loose not because of bitfinex, you will loose because of yourself :D.
you will start nice enough, get more agressive, then loose all, without margin you dont loose as much, either you have your usd or your bitcoins... price is irrelevant

NO!!!  
**Dont be a lotery winner!** they loose all their money within a year or two.  
Keep your life exactly as it was before.  
your portfolio is obviously super charged on the bitcoin side, i would personally sell a bit (10%) of the bitcoin and 90% of the BCH (because its garbage).  
with the money you get reinvest, you can pay the first payment of a new flat and rent it, or you can simply buy some ETF like VTI or Berkshire.  
For the rest of the bitcoin, you are already a gad damn target, so order immediately a trezor or a ledger and put them there with a creative backup system.

how do you go around cutting the internet ? would that be world, or would that be single country ? if its country you still own your bitcoin and everything is working.
its extremely hard to cut of the internet, even if you go and physically cut the backbone cables so that NO internet cables exit the country, you can still use a phone and connect to internet via calling someone serving you, either with landline or with mobile, and then you have satelite internet, also hard to disable.

the private blockchain will do exactlly what the banks want, they dont need bitcoin, the only weakness is that if someone joins he network with enough hashing power they can fuck the banks, BUT that is easy to monitor :D.
this will be a tool not only for database, it will provide trust between partners, and i guess that all banks will be hashing in an equal proportion in a closed blockchain, if hashrate increases it sets off alarms, and as long as it doesnt increase it will work fine.

i dont mean it from kindness, its because the offer is quite limited, like most bitcoins are held by only a few people and needs to reach other places, of course if gemini is not a good platform and doesnt deserve your business then its good to not use it, but if there is not enough offer then simply there wont be buyers.
and i clearly said for a profit, i do it in other small national exchanges i do the importing of larger ammounts and i get payed a premium.

its not only bitcoin, but in harddisk very often there is very sensitive data, my friend last week bought a laptop that came with credit card numbers and confirmation codes for example, names of clients, contacts stuff like that.
there are services to dispose of electronics, there you can take hdd and get rid of them if you have too many.

if there is a 2fa for funding it should not be able to be removed without said 2fa.... 
kraken f'ked :(  
provide support to user would be the most fair since its a basic security measure.

If dave is satoshi and craig has the keys but encrypted all he has to do is wait for him to be a trillionaire.

if you loose your 2FA and you need to disable it, contact tech support, they verify your identity through a procedure and then disable it, said disable for security reasons would take x or y hours.
additionally phonecalls to announced phone numbers can be placed.

Absolutely not, using bitcoin is generally a mess, very insecure environment for average user, and if it costs 20 bucks, might as well use already stablished systems whith warranties and protections.
