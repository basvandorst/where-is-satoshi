yes. and Silbert *only* Hodls.. because trading on speculation doesn't happen in bitcoin.

Dear Satoshi... 
12 months of listening to Counterparty shills talking up their obviously flaky relationship with Overstock on r/bitcoin..
Now.. Hooray for Counterparty splitting with Overstock. (even though Patrick Byrne kept saying he wasn't fully simpatico with Counterparty)
So... no more Medici..Colored coins work on top of Bitcoin!!!! this is Huge!
Thanks for the thousands of exclamation points, and having to read the word HUGE millions of times... to no avail .. smh.
At least it's not as bad as the "Reddit Notes are going to be based on Bitcoin's blockchain" fiasco....

just r/bitcoin in general...
Other than the Silbert and Dotcom stories last 2 days..
Some of the lowest views in months last week. and two 33k uniques back to back, can't remember two in a row that low..
Awhile ago.

What the..?
No that would be distributed, which is funny because you accuse me of confusing the two.
But that is not what *would be* happening here, hypothetically..
Assuming they're either using a payment processor, centralized, or an exchange, centralized, giving up their private keys and trusting in those centralized entities.
Then transferring to their bank, again, centralized. 
This isn't a distributed scenario.
@_date: 2015-03-11 08:23:01
what part of this is decentralized in this equation..? 
this really requires very little thought power. go one step outside of your wallet.. 
and you're in a centralized arena.  Payment Processor? Exchange?
The repeat of silly talk over and over doesn't help.

You've contradicted yourself in less than an hour.
And "continuum" implies that was Satoshi's intentions. 
If you're gonna pretend Bitcoin wasn't ingeniously created to be decentralized. 
And is centralized now by choice and not by force..  
Lets also pretend it's been bastardized by centralized parties created to capitalize on certain aspects of the protocol.. Shall we?
The question would then become, what difference is there? 
I can choose which bank i would like to use too.  Or choose none, keep my cash, gold, under the bed, then again, not very efficient that way, just like using Bitcoin without a centralized entity.
Again this all started with "decentralized system" not arguing speed, costs, etc.

first it was Draper lowballin'... now Silbert? 
Maybe Silbert *hasn't* been selling enough on these pumps to gain capital?... 
I would hate to be one of his "customers" if that's the case.
@_date: 2015-03-06 23:32:04
Of course. then again we can look wayy back in history, all of two months ago when Draper only won a small portion of the last auction (2000 coins).. when the price was trading around $350.
then later, after the last big dump, tweeted, "bought 2000 coins at around $200"..
But true, they could still be chasing these big slots of coins at a premium.. or we can just look at what we know. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 04:01:39
he bought 2000 last auction, one lot, and 2000 during the crash (which is what I already said).
**"Draper won part of the bitcoin auction in December, successfully bidding on one lot, totaling 2,000 bitcoins"**
Nice try.

"Then show him using btc"...  That shouldn't be difficult... Maybe better suited for a short film.
So this dude.. lets assume he has BTC.. And knows how to use it securely enough to use a lightweight wallet....
otherwise we'll have to show him bartering on the corner after setting up a meeting with someone from localbitcoins, who is gonna charge 5-10% over cost... 
or show him using a BTC ATM which charges 5%-10% over cost, requires KYC, and Bio ID, etc..
.... Ok so he has it already... he wants to send it to someone else overseas.  Then that reciever gets the BTC and again goes through a localbuyer who is gonna either buy at your loss, or they're lucky to have a buyer in need to buy at their rate.. 
Or the reciever goes through a centralized entity or exchange that charges a fee.  And then sends to their bank which takes 2-3 business days, if they're lucky.
That should be somewhat easy to tackle for a commercial...
We'll ignore the whole volatility (seller sends BTC that has lost or gained 30% in a day from the time they bartered with local, sent, received, exchanged, transferred to bank) 
aspect for the sake of the shiny commercial.
Maybe write at the bottom of the commercial, like a disclaimer?
"Volatility is expected and part of the fun of Bitcoin"?

and yet everyone on r/bitcoin is pretending mycoin scam has absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin...
A mycoin evangelist at the Bitcoin Conference at Pattaya..
no I did not use memegenerator to create this. and yes, that is a mycoin labeled lightstick..  these scammers went all out with their razzle dazzles.
@_date: 2015-03-08 04:12:02
and the 200k giveback to Gox customers... through Kraken.
I'm sure *some* of them would like some cash for bitcoins.. 
esp. when they were worth about $900 before they got froze out..
