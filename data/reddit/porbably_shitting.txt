I think he meant to write bull trap

Man I didn't just make up the fact that it's exponential growth you can just look at the charts and see that is it exponential growth. That's just what exponential growth looks like. When you say 'it's more like non-linear logarithmic regression' you expose how deluded you are. You can log transform any data to correct for exponential growth but in this case why would you? Why would you want to remove the very thing from your data that you need to be mindful of? It's like say traffic lights aren't red if you look through these special sunglasses that remove the colour red from your vision.
So honestly do you think btc will just rise exponentially and level off? You don't think we will see a harsh correction? Bubble and burst cycles aren't necessarily a bad thing if you can spot them. I'm not saying btc is going to burst because it's shit, it's going to burst because it's overbought and people are piling in without a second thought. Encouraging people to buy now and denying a bubble is bad for btc, it means new money will get burnt and not come back for longer. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:28:47
Assuming it can scale then I would say that's a fair point.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:19:17
When/of that happens then yea cool. My argument is that's a loong long way off and to assume the price will bounce straight back up to over 20k in the short term is optimistic and imo very unlikely. I'm the long term you might be right.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:56:45
Yea they created a fast blockchain instead.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:58:07
If you were a Wall Street trader looking at this unsustainable growth you would literally jizz your pants at the chance to short btc right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:29:46
Oh right that makes sense thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:23:20
Why is bitcoin different to every other market? You may see highs like that again but you seem to think it's a sure thing when it's not.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:25:19
The way people talk about bitcoins price on this sub makes it seem like it's a sure thing. Like the price is just going to double each month until some arbitrary top is reached that suits them.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:33:20
Markets go through cycles. There is a better time to get in. Use this time to research crypto, how it works, its use cases, where it derives its value from, and how to spread risk and strategise. Wait till there is a horrible correction and people loose their money, wait for the negative media attention, wait for the predictions of btc hitting a million switch to btc will hit $0, wait for the slow and painful bleed out, wait for the masses to forget about blockchain. This is the point you buy.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:29:18
Wow awesome numbers that really puts it into perspective. Makes me feel more at ease for selling earlier today. Prefer to sell now and miss out on the top than panic sell on the elevator down!
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:12:16
No you're right the price has been going up. Almost like it's the exponential growth you see in the euphoria phase of a bubble cycle. The next trap you face will be a bull trap, these 'bear traps' your seeing right now are just noise not a 40% correction before a 60-80% bleed out.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:20:08
Hey man I appreciate the time you took to write a detailed reply to me. Look, you've obviously taken time to get informed and study up and you've picked your position because of that. From where I'm standing I can't see it going any other way. I think it's over bought and all I see is blind exuberance at this point. I'm bullish on crypto long term but I'm sitting on the sidelines on this one. It could go up, it could go down, and people will only look like fools in hindsight. I genuinely wish you the best going forward. The one thing we can both agree on is that the next few weeks/months will be very interesting for everyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:55:38
Man every asset class that sees extreme growth goes through bear phases. This is just how markets work, it's universal. An asset seems attractive, it gets bought up, people fomo, early investors sell. The good thing is bear markets allow smaller investors to jump on. A bear market for bitcoin would also give the developers time to improve the protocol and address scaling issues. By the time the next rally starts bitcoins price will likely reflect its competency as a currency. The above situation I believe is far more likely than bitcoins price just going up every month forever. People blind to the fact that markets go through cycles are the ones that won't reduce risk, and will likely sell in a bear cycle. People on this sub need to be open to the fact that we may enter a bear market soon or at some point in the future, there are no guarantees of monthly price increases.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:54:55
Read step 3 and then read the comments on this sub. Also go to the ethtrader sub and look at the comments from June this year. Same sort of blind hype clouds people's judgement. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:43:40
Yea that cat fell from 20k to 10k pretty fast. I'm pretty sure he's dead.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:05:09
Only if you sold below where it currently is. And assuming it doesn't drop further. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:40:48
What a guy...
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:15:41
Could it be because you keep buying during the euphoria phase of the market cycle? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:56:13
There's also that saying 'be fearful when others are greedy', and the level of greed we are seeing is unprecedented. Man when this trend snaps back it's going to shock a lot of the late investors. I feel like it will take a few hours to spark a panic and then we will be in a downtrend for longer than anyone wants to believe. I could be wrong of course but I'm surprised at the level of confidence people have right now given this parabolic rise. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:42:39
The fuck have you been smoking bro?
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:26:07
I think patience is key. All markets become overbought and oversold, crypto is no different even though some people on this sub think the price will continue to rise forever... 
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:43:59
Yea nah it's bullshit
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:10:13
Ok this I can get behind
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:04:08
I mean we can assume this can't grow at this rate forever. That's the one thing we can assume actually.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:09:40
I hear this argument a lot but I'm not convinced it's an adoption curve. I think crypto will as a whole see such a curve but atm it is just been bought to be sold for fiat. When crypto is integrated in the back end of our financial system and people are using it for micropayments, smart contracts, and personal finance because it's beneficial outside of speculation then we will likely se this adoption curve. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:19:59
Take the stairs up and the elevator down :) 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:54:44
I'm soo sick of this 'weak hands' bullshit. If someone wants to take a small loss instead of loosing more in an obvious downturn then what the fucks wrong with that? Anyone who sold during the recent sell off is probably doing better than anyone here who has 'strong hands' right now. This is looking more and more like a bull trap every second and if that is the case we will be seeing lower lows for some time.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:14:59
But that assumption of growth in itself is insanely optimistic. The fact that so many people believe that is what causes a sudden rise in price followed by a 50% drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:18:55
Lol ok you are right mate. Markets don't go through cycles and this exponential growth is sustainable. I'm just a salty fudder! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:31:29
I might even open a small short myself. Same amount of money to be made on the way down as there is on the way up!
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:08:28
Have you ever held through a prolonged bear market? Wait until the uncertainty creeps in after the dead cat bounce and slow bleed out. After you wait that out for years until we are at the same point again then you can talk about weak hands. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:37:05
You think the most important thing to do in a financial revolution is to hold your currency? Don't you find that ironic?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:05:42
Haha yea I'm an arrogant dick sometimes but I'm not here to ruin anyone's day. You to take care!
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:07:40
I haven't heard that one, what does that mean?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:40:25
Yea standing on the sidelines feels just as bad as buying low and waiting. A lot of the time the hardest thing to do is the right thing. People have been championing the hodl meme for soo long but holding as the prices sore is easy, forgoing profit is hard.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:21:59
I'm thinking bull trap. Look at the price on a 6 month chart. I don't see us going above 20k for a while and if that's the case then people will realise that their next best option will to be to step off at their next best chance.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:40:32
I think what he's saying is being a dick about people selling gives this community a bad look. A few months ago this sub was far more reasonable and humble, now it seems to be over run with shit like this. I don't even see the reason for it, is it to make yourself feel more assured about your decision to hold? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:19:53
I don't know what that is, let me just quickly ask Jeeves.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:58:14
Lol 15 down votes for an opinion just as valid as 'hold it will go up'. No one fucking knows. To be fair the 12 month chart looks pretty terrible.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:22:07
And then he falls over again cradling a dead cat in his arms.
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:17:05
Yea I get that but I don't think it's the most important thing. The most important thing for a currency is for it to be a medium of exchange. If people started holding onto their national currencies rather than spending them there would be an economic downturn. An issue with btc and all crypto right now is that people are unwilling to part with them since the price keeps increasing. I hear many people talk about the price increase as an 'adoption curve' but real adoption is people using crypto to pay for things. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:21:40
What indicators?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:01:11
I'm just reading all the comments of people who think they are about to buy the dip when really they are about to buy the biggest bull trap in the history of bubbles. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:03:08
1. The level of greed. People have thrown caution to the wind. You see a lot of this 'euphoric' activity right before a crash. 
2. Fundamentals. Yes a peer to peer decentralised currency is great but btc is limited to 3 transactions a second, has been rifled by contentious forks. And has a complicated path ahead of them when it comes to scaling. They may or may not overcome these issues but the currency is way overbought right now given it's obvious and glaring issue.
3. Btc is doubling in price in half the time after each of these small corrections. Someone else on this sub mentioned that if it continues at this rate the market cap of btc will equal all of the stock market in a few weeks. Unsustainable.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:12:10
Nah you can open a short on quite a few exchanges. I've shorted both ethereum and bitcoin on poloniex before. Just for fun it's not recommend to margin trade cryptos but I like to pretend to know what I'm doing.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:55:24
Yea it's going through the same cycle you saw in 2014. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:22:32
Unrealistic. Kraken has less hardware then that.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:14:37
Bitcoin will be around for thousands of years!? It's been around for 10 and you're calling thousands of years! Do you have any idea how fast technology changes over time? And if bitcoin takes 20 years to scale I think a different cryptocurrency will take its place first.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:22:06
@_date: 2017-10-19 09:53:37
Someone should tell them that 'digital gold' is sort of an analogy. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:03:18
I feel your pain. You can buy if kiwicoin but there's a slight premium when you do that. Really would like Coinbase to hurry up...
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:57:04
Diversify. To begin with do something like half btc, 25% eth, 15% ltc and 10% xmr. These coins are going nowhere soon. From there you can branch out your research into lower market cap coins if you so choose but no more than 5% on those riskier investments. Another bit of advice I would have liked to give myself when I started would be to keep a small stash of fiat free to buy the dips.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:13:37
No I disagree. If this was any other asset class I'm sure you would be less likely to defend it. Bitcoin may be in a bubble, it may not, but you sure as fuck can't tell me it isn't in a bubble just because it hasn't popped yet. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:13:20
Let's put scaling issues aside since I was addressing your point that a single btc can only be useful as a currency if each btc was valued at 1/4 of a cent. I'm saying it is impossible for btc to have such a low value if it is adopted as a global currency due to supply and demand. How do I buy a car worth $60,000 with btc if the market cap of btc is $50,000? And even an infinitesimal amount of the global money supply is still in the billions. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:38:08
Let's see your working! I gave the car example. If a btc was valued at 1/4 of a cent and I tried to buy a car worth more than 50,000 I would need to buy all the btc in the world! Can you give me any convincing evidence that the true value of a btc should be around 1/4 of a cent?? I think not but at this point I don't think you'll ever be convinced so there's probably no point in me asking. I tell you what, open a short on btc to 1/4 cent and let me know how that goes!
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:17:42
Awesome just signed up I want to get more eth before devcon3! Thanks for the heads up :) 
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:15:39
If I win that hat I'll eat it
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:37:17
That's not how it works. For someone to spend bitcoin someone has to buy bitcoin. Acceptance by a large retailer such as Amazon means that at any given time more hands will be hodling bitcoin and thus increase in price. Also this would be great for the acceptance of btc and lead to further adoption. You will need large retailers to keep bitcoin in circulation during bear markets since dnm aren't going to sustain the price anymore as they move away from btc in favour of privacy coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:11:18
Never heard of that and I just checked it out. Can New Zealanders buy from there now? I might try sign up later...
@_date: 2017-10-19 09:29:48
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:08:40
I wholeheartedly agree with you if you want to just get your stake of the decentralized economy and HODL then btc is your best bet. If your more adventurous however I would recommend venturing out towards some other projects but my only word of warning is not to dip to deeply into the lower market cap projects.
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:15:59
I have only been using kiwi-coin and once or twice local bitcoins with cash but haven't found a way of buying which is cheap. I haven't tried cryptopia so I'll have a look into next time!
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:25:16
Sweet I think I'll try that since I need to reevaluate my buy in strategy anyway. Hopefully can get a slightly better deal at least until coinbase comes to NZ. Idk why I can't buy from coinbase right now I mean it's the Internet!? At least I know there's others that share my frustration
@_date: 2017-10-19 09:56:00
Still though I'm sick of paying that premium just because we live in NZ. When's Coinbase coming to NZ!?
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:53:24
Who is going to load up their Paypal account just to spend it? And I would argue more people would be buying btc to use it and the people who use it to buy things would also replenish their stack. Not to mention the retailers who accept btc would start to use it instead of converting it back into fiat. You're arguing people have held onto btc for all these years just so they can spend it all at amazon and drive the price down? Same argument was used for people buying ICOs with ethereum saying spending ether would drive the price down. It just doesn't work like that. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:04:47
You think a global currency would have a market cap of $50,000? The combined value of all currencies is in the trillions, if btc absorbed a tiny portion of the global money supply you would expect the btc value to be much higher than a quarter of a cent even if it is just used as a currency let alone a store of value.
