Maybe they sold some of their crypto at the ATH to buy this and then bought it all back at $6k. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 21:37:04
This is actually some really great advice. You should try to get this listed on some crypto blogs in a "tips and Tricks" article.

Glad to see that they put all of the crypto above PayPal.

Hello. We can see you did a specific amount transaction where you sent more than we told you to send to complete your order. If you send over the amount and don't supply us with a return address we don't know where to send the extra money so you do have to contact support and we will return your extra money. We will never hold onto money that does not belong to us (if you have a failed transaction, or issue of the nature you are having, etc.) as long as you leave us a support request we always make sure to correct any issues our users have. Please send us a support request if you have not already and will will sort this out for you. Please note, we are not open on weekends but do our bets to get to requests on weekends when we are able. Here is the link to our support request line: 
We will get back with you as soon as humanly possible!

Hi u/walloon5, 
To HODL, send, receive, and track your portfolio you don't need to KYC. In order to trade on our new platform, we do require users to KYC. Let us know if you have any other questions!

RIP Prism ��It was an awesome product.

No need to worry - your funds are in your control on your hardware wallet. We don't hold our user's funds, we only integrate with wallets that keep the private keys in the hands of the users. This empowers our users and eliminates the risk of ShapeShift losing user funds. Exchange hacks are real!
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:30:05
If you still haven't heard from support after 3 days, please DM me your support ticket number and I will check the status.

Hey everyone!
Our wonderful support team first looks to see if the exchange completed or not then diagnoses the issue- was the deposit over the limits, was it the precise amount etc. 
If the exchange completed we send out the funds that were exchanged, if not we return your deposit. 
Now about the rates. We have two types of exchanges: quick and precise. With quick exchanges the rates are variable until the exchange occurs. If you want to lock in your rate to ensure you know the amount you will receive we recommend using the precise feature. 
I can see that your exchange was successful but the BTC failed to send. We have you in the queue to send the BTC out to the address provided in the exchange. 
Hope this helps. We will be in touch once the funds have been sent. Thank you!

Hey metalzip!
You should receive an email confirmation after opening a ticket. Please check bulk mail as it may get sorted to a folder other than your inbox. If you have no receipt in your inbox, I recommend submitting another ticket. If you DM me with the email you used to open the ticket, I can check the database to see if it exists. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:29:35
Hello! Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We are aware of this bug and addressed the issue roughly 24 hours ago. Things seem to be sending successfully now. 
Unfortunately, this but affected a large number of users which has caused a higher than usual volume of tickets. Right now the ticket resolution time is roughly 72 hours. Thank you for your patience, someone will help you soon!

Hi there,

This type of feedback is much-appreciated; here at ShapeShift we’re constantly working on improving the platform and making it a better experience for users.
Here’s some clarification to a few points that were made in the article:
*Regarding the timer*: This is only used during “Precise” transactions, which can be used to lock in a certain exchange price for a limited amount of time. You’ll notice that there is no timer for “Quick” transactions; that’s because these transactions will take place at the prevailing market rate. 
Timers are necessary for Precise transactions because in these volatile crypto markets, prices can change very quickly. As such, we can’t guarantee a specific rate beyond a narrow timeframe of just a few minutes. If you want more time to complete a transaction, Quick is the way to go.
*High minimums for exchanges:* Our minimums change frequently based on market conditions and network fees. Currently, the minimum deposit for a BTC-ETH transaction is about $3.50 worth of Bitcoin. Our minimums were much higher earlier this year, when Bitcoin mining fees had spiked upward. In some cases, the mining fee would be far higher than the transaction amount. We take this into account in order to create a better user experience. That said, we are exploring ways to further reduce our minimums in the near future.
*Our customer support team and their names:* Our support staff uses aliases for security purposes. We let them have some fun and choose a name related to the blockchain space.
*Multiple agents answering one ticket:* The team works hard to provide users with answers to their issues, and sometimes more than one agent will jump on a ticket. We know that interacting with too many people can make things confusing, and we’ve recently implemented a support policy limiting the number of agents you’ll talk with to two per ticket.
Again, we take constructive feedback seriously, and look forward to creating a better experience for ShapeShift users in the weeks, months, and years to come.

Hey guys, we appreciate the feedback especially since we are still in beta. This is a long term project and we are listening! We suggest checking out this blog  for more details about Prism. 
TL:DR We have put a ton of effort into creating a product that leverages the benefits of decentralization, enabling increased transparency and security, and removing custodial risk which is a hallmark of ShapeShift’s product philosophy.
At no point do you have to trust ShapeShift with your funds. Our infrastructure is being built so we can become more trustless over time
Discretion over what happens to the value of your portfolio is dictated by code, not decided by people.
Thanks for keeping the conversation going.

Thanks for the kind words! Have you signed up to access the new [KeepKey client]( It will improve the UX greatly &amp; offer new features. KeepKey users will get early access.
@_date: 2019-05-05 03:37:43
KeepKey can hold a practically unlimited number of accounts, has a large, sleek display that shows full addresses - which helps prevent man in the middle attacks, support for [30+ digital assets]( &amp; it is fully integrated with the new ShapeShift Platform.
Using [KeepKey]( with the new client (instead of the current KeepKey client) will be more convenient than average cold storage. Your private keys are secured on hardware, and yet you’re able to interact with the new digital financial frontier in an easy way. You can view your portfolio balances any time, anywhere. Your hardware wallet only needs to be connected for signing transactions.  
If you want to try it out - let me know. I have a 60% off discount code for Redditors.

@_date: 2019-05-05 04:00:05
We recommend using wallets that integrate with hardware security - so that your private keys are only in your control. Using custodial services are generally easier to use, but the risk is not worth it. There are many solutions out there and on the way that will help resolve the custody risk.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:27:09
To clarify: we've had a high volume of transactions. A small percentage of those lead to support tickets. So due to higher volume, we're receiving more tickets.

If you aren't in control of your own keys - you aren't in charge of your crypto. Don't store more than you are willing to lose on an exchange. If your wallet starts to hold more that you are comfortable parting ways with - it's time to move to a hardware wallet. Sooner than later - Exchange hacks are real; better to be safe than sorry.   
Move any crypto that you are not actively trading or that you are hodling long-term out of exchange-based hot wallets and into more secure cold wallets. While cold storage can make it more challenging to track your portfolio totals and market price, it’s the safest way to store your crypto.

Hi albabit - 
Sorry to hear you've had an issue with your transaction. What's your support ticket number? Please rest assured that your digital wealth has not been lost.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:55:53
Hello again albabit - 
Thanks for taking a closer look at our API doc. Many affiliates and partners use this API to facilitate successful transactions every day.
We have a "failed" status option for situations where we have no return address (the user may choose not to enter this), and we can't send back to the sending address (due to issues like exchange wallets or shared wallets). In these cases, a failed status is necessary.
