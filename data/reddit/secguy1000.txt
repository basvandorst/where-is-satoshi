and then theres you, virtue signaling to us with your anti bill/msft rhetoric.
you are pathetic.

my friend was guaranteeing his friends and family that any money they put in to crypto would at least double. this was december last year.
i know he is down around $70k. one of his friends since high school is out around $150k. others "only" out between $2-$7k. lots of bad blood.
i declined to invest because he was using the g word. thank fuck
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:37:20
if thats true, fair point. i was under the impression from the comment above and the couple articles ive read that he had been
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:49:56
lol the sec in my name refers to information security (an area in which i work), not the SEC. try again, smartguy.
and for the record, im neither. i just think you are pathetic.

selling drugs to adults i dont care about
his ambitions of murder mean he should stay locked up

i heard about them just as it was no longer profitable to mine on CPU's, and i had a shit computer with no GPU so i didnt pursue it and forgot about the entire concept.
some time later i bought a few bitcoins for $90. held on for a while, thought it was a fad and a waste of my time and money. yet again i forgot all about bitcoin, until last year when the price started to jump and real life friends started talking about it.
ah well, shit happens

cool story try harder
@_date: 2018-03-26 06:14:45
are you going to short stocks ahead of this drop you talk about?
@_date: 2018-03-20 04:43:08
why would anyone feel the need to prove anything to you? you sound like a wanker.
@_date: 2018-03-14 03:15:35
i wasnt trying to imply anything. i was asking what you think would happen
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:15:00
lol not that sec. sec as in it security (an industry in which i work)
@_date: 2018-03-13 03:10:27
lol. ok. so let me get this straight;
im a parrot because i cant see it based on my experience.
you're the one posting medium articles trying to prove your point.
id continue to argue with you but id suggest you have some kind of social disorder which i don't want to antagonize

the key word you are ignoring is "independently"
if CW provides plain text, non-cryptographically verifiable email headers that would convince you?
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:06:00
your website doesnt have correct whois information, which is a violation of ICANN rules.
i encourage people to visit 
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:22:59
the site works, but the swiper javascript throws errors

his story is fiction
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:30:42
i dont see it.
the only cultures i can think of which operate like that do not have facilities that are comparable to what i have now.
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:24:32
lol. you are stupid.
you invested your entire families wealth in something people are saying is a scam?? lol
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:13:11
in your hypothetical scenario; what happens to roads, healthcare, police force, etc, etc when the government can't tax you in order to provide these services?
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:18:10
i highly doubt that logs from the servers the mail supposedly traversed are still available.
how are they going to verify it?
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:27:20
i had thought that these emails predated dkim as a concept but as it turns out, they dont.
dkim was around at the time, just not in widespread use, so it is indeed a possibility.
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:13:49
I don't care about his whois stats, you are right.
Thats what private whois services are for. OP is just a cheapskate.
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:06:04
war? you mentioned r/btc and r/bitcoin -- not me. frankly, im not sure what that has to do with our discussion at all.
im nitpicking because i work in computer security and what you are proposing doesn't provide anymore proof than what we have already.
CW is a conman. You can't be convinced by anything he does that ISN'T INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIABLE. Email headers provided by CW are not that.

thats a dumb comment from bill, but this line from the article irks me:


i really dont think bill gates gives a flying fuck about making money on crypto. i doubt "missing the boat" is his motivation for that comment.
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:24:02
and how do you intend to verify the accuracy of those headers? they are easily faked.
@_date: 2018-02-28 06:07:14
between this post on twitter and your comment replies to this thread i have come to form the opinion that you are a complete idiot with no ability to process rational thought.
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:34:27
what are you smoking and is it for sale?
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:38:47
it says would choose, not have chosen.
id be guessing that the majority of the people surveyed aren't putting money in to either anyway
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:36:24
thats too expensive cpu-wise, so here we are
@_date: 2018-04-12 00:54:20
as a fellow rider, id never use this
