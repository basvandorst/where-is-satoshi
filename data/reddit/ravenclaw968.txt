Also is it true that some miners can exhaust the nonce space in seconds. If so, how is it that a block is mined every ten minutes?

I just have one more question.
If a miner just took one transaction and created a block, would that be valid enough to get 12.5 BTC?

Deflation, except in the form of a positive supply shock, which can happen when deregulation happens (but not a fan of dependent on the regulation and the long term implications) or technological advancements in industry, is far far far far far far far far far worse than any inflation we’ve seen after the oil crisis.

Sure it happens with or without a central bank but the central bank aims at limiting its impact if done right and regulation can be used so that fucking rating agencies before 2008 don’t constantly give a AAA valued loan when the valuation is much lower.
I don’t see how what the ratings agency did with the loan won’t happen in blockchain, because it’s up to the rater to deem the value of the loan. The proof-of-method for mining doesn’t work because the proof of work needed to declare the loan AAA or BB would be the same in both cases. The digital signature encryption doesn’t work because the problem is between one of the endpoints (the rater declaring loans by their value) rather than a problem in the security of the transaction.
There’s no way to force a rater to rate accurately without regulation and regulation becomes far more harder with cryptocurrencies than fiat money.

That was because Fed chairmans before the Great Depression and Recession was subject to regulatory capture by the banks and massive deregulation occurred under the Republican administrations before the Great Depression and the Republican administration and the Clinton administration before 2008.
 Proof-of-work is what it’s called, sorry if I missnamed it before. Also you should really know how it works if you make generalizations that blockchain will cure cancer or statements in a similar vein.
You’re the one, if you replied to me before, that said blockchain would end recessions even if lending still exists, so I was merely trying to argue against that point you made.

Lol that’s so contradictory. You hate fiat but you’re just using BTC to make profit?

This is what happened before the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 and after the killing of the National Bank where recessions were far more frequent and painful than anything after the Federal Reserve.
Sure the Great Depression and Recession were things but that was because the previous Federal Reserve chairmans before the collapses pushed for deregulation, something you seem to think is the solution.

I’m well aware of the near impossibility of breaking a hash algorithm.
That wasn’t why I created this thread.

Because that number is lower than any target number?

Yeah, 3Blue1Brown is amazing. His videos were sort of eccentric at the beginning but over time he developed a really nice niche with his videos.

Thanks so much for the explanation!
Sorry I’m late with my reply, but would have mean that a hash with 64 zeroes would work all the time assuming BitCoin doesn’t change the method in which miners get rewarded?

I’m just asking a question, no need to be a dick.

Your first paragraph doesn’t do jack to refute any of the points I’m made.
Businesses creating regulation to hurt other businesses is a natural expression of capitalism because if you can use a power source to help you make more money, why don’t you do it?
So that’s why we want to limit business influence in government.
I really don’t understand what you’re trying to argue.
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:39:55
That was someone else, not me, check the usernames.
And I’m not about the argue with someone who can’t understand nuance.
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:06:42
Holy shit this is great. Thanks!

Unregulated capitalism creates an atmosphere similar to the United States in the Gilded Age where social mobility declines, corporations influence the Congressman for greater monopolization, people are living hellish lifestyles, entire towns are owned by one company that purposely set the pay so that their workers can only scrape by bare necessities to survive, and creates an atmosphere of contempt for the rich and the corporations and that’s why I wouldn’t blame them for supporting far-left socialist candidates like William Jennings Bryan.
Unregulated capitalism leads to socialism or communism and that’s why I like watered-down capitalism with a strong social safety net.
