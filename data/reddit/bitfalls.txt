It can't help with anything because it's not parallelizable work. It's just a delay function (D in VDF is Delay) and that doesn't really have applications in bitcoin, on any layer.

You didn't answer any of the questions. If microtransactions don't exist on BTC now, and will exist with LN, then we're not solving an existing problem. The existing problem is unusable network due to wait times and fees. These fees will remain and you'll still have to pay a fortune to open and close a channel (two expensive transactions) which does not help with (and in fact works against) the main type of traffic on the BTC network: p2p no-middleman payments.

Cool, now that's a source. Nice.

We regularly do business with Middle East countries at Coinvendor.io. But you mustn't mind fees - all businesses that facilitate this legally have huge legal and accounting expenses and 5% is not uncommon to see in the daily chart. The 5% won't matter in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:18:24
Would you then please be able to answer [some questions about the LN's feasability]( In particular, I think it's dead tech before it's even come to life, and I think it's absurd to hope that a private company's product will save a "decentralized" currency from stalling.
I have had this discussion with many people, including core members, and all seem to run away from the hard questions. I would really like someone to finally answer this.
@_date: 2018-09-03 18:13:37
That's faith speaking.
This might help explain why Bitcoin can never be the decentralized cash we need, but stablecoins collateralized by it might: 
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:51:29
Yes. It doesn't work because there are "clouds", "islands". There's one node with 1000 channels in the USA, and another in China with 1000 channels, but no channels in between them. I want to transact with someone in China. I need to close my USA channel (TX fee) and open another with the China node (TX fee). Two transactions for what would have taken one previously. Now consider nodes who don't transact in ANY way other than via LN and basically force you into LN, and then consider the fact that governments can easily control, censor, and kill such big nodes, and you've got a nice, centralized, financial sector recreated. Anyway, I've listed and explained all this in the questions. It'd be cool if you could go through them and address the concerns there for everyone else to see. I've shared that document with over 200 people, both devs and civilians, and no one answered these hard questions, everyone is just ridiculously optimistic with absolutely no reason to be other than "faith".

Not necessarily, they may have just purchased your email address with a list someone offered them. If you're even the least bit unsure, just avoid them. There's alternative services that haven't contacted you unsolicited, so it's always better to prefer those. Whether legit or not, Trade.io is fishing for customers and that's not a good sign anyway.

We'll sell for PP at Coinvendor.io but on a person by person basis due to possible chargeback. You'll also need to increase your limits with repeat purchases for the same reason. PayPal is incredibly dangerous to business through, especially for cryptocurrency companies, so it's not easy. An alternative is virwox but limits will also hit you there and you can expect a 30% markup because you have to go through linden dollars + fees.

Sellers will generally stay away from PP because of the possibility to do chargebacks. 
That said, we'll experiment with PP on a case by case basis at Coinvendor.io and we generally work towards higher amounts gradually as trust is built with the client. Feel free to get in touch via Coinvendor

As described in the post, you need to commit funds to a specific channel between two nodes. Each two nodes need to do this for their own channel. There is no way to move funds from channel A to channel B without closing one and topping the other up. This means that in order for them to be able to sell you 100 BTC ever, total, without closing or opening a new channel, they need to pre-commit 100 BTC when opening the channel initially and keep it there in reserve "just in case". The video linked at the end of the article demonstrates this rather well.
@_date: 2018-04-15 10:42:27


I don't think people will be willing to do that once the LN is big enough, but I would love to be wrong.


Why would Coinbase have more BTC in its channel towards me than I originally purchased? They would have to top-up, unless they "just in case" pre-funded the channel with 100 BTC on opening, and now are just waiting for additional purchases from me. This makes no sense, especially considering there's many venues where one can buy crypto, and more are popping up daily. Include in the mix the flood of dex-es coming up and this argument is moot.


You're adopting a tone I don't like. I will not accept optimism as counter-arguments and ad hominems as your authority. Show me code, show me analysis, show me arguments that go beyond passion.

Fair. I'll amend the article.
@_date: 2018-04-15 10:32:51


You're optimistically assuming people will want to have their nodes at 0 or negative fees.


Just because you're not sending the TX doesn't mean there isn't one. A purchase from Coinbase, Coinvendor, Kraken, Binance, whatever else won't help without an on-chain transaction sending those funds to the channel in question. How do you expect new money to end up in a channel without a tx?
@_date: 2018-04-15 10:23:38
The conclusion is mine, it is subjective in that I feel like it solves the problems that do not exist, but does not solve those that do. Sorry if it's coming across confusing, I'll look into rewording that.

Well done, you've converted me with your arguments.
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:28:26
Right, but those don't do transactions, just note balances and then do consolidation once per unit of time when withdrawal requests are issued. Satoshi-ish amounts will become economical, though, when BTC rises in price again, no doubt, it's just not a problem now.
@_date: 2018-04-15 19:11:36
I don't think opt-in privacy by means of an additional software layer is the way to go in regards to privacy. There are better approaches. Hell, Bitcoin has kind of had the option to do ZK transactions [since 2016](
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:59:28
All that's a possibility, can't argue with that.
@_date: 2018-04-16 06:37:58
You're mixing something up I think. There is no way to transfer from channel to channel without an on chain tx. The node per se is not full, what's full is the channel to each connection. Unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean?
@_date: 2018-04-15 10:12:50

To buy BTC in a specific channel, you have to have money in that channel already, on someone's side at least. If there's no money in that particular channel, no money can be added without an additional transaction.
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:57:19
Yes but they need to deposit a large sum into the channel when opening it to be able to accommodate your future purchases. That's the problem - an exchange can't possibly know how much business to expect from each customer in perpetuity and lock up that many funds.
@_date: 2018-04-15 10:01:41
We'll cover all those aspects in individual posts but in general, micro payments don't exist in any form in bitcoin today so they are not a current problem. Small payments could be helped, yes. We'll have an in-depth post on privacy, can't really go into it here, and I'm not sure what you mean under unlimited capacity? It's quite a bit more limited than the current system - it's limited to a fraction of the amount that's locked in the LN and that's not going to change.
