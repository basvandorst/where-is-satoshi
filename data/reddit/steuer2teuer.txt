lol i did the same when the Willy Report came out. I thought surely this will crash the price as it looked like for a moment that the whole $1000+ run up could have been one big manipulation and/or fabrication. But the next day it turned out things weren't so bad and others didn't panic sell like i did and i bought back in slightly higher. Lesson learned. No more panic sales unless there's a critical, systemic, unsolvable flaw found in Bitcoin itself.

You're missing the point Brian. It's a communication issue on Coinbase's end. He uses this hyperbole headline because A. it actually feels like theft when you get left hanging out to dry for your money and B. he needs to do it to get the help and communication he should've been getting in the first place. If you want to stop these kinds of posts from happening you need to improve communication. Namely improve response time and knowing when to use templated responses and when to use personal responses. And cut down on the woolly language as much as possible.
This guy was waiting 2+ days for a response AND received a woolly templated response that didn't apply to his question for his $12,000 in limbo due to a site bug. Wouldn't you be pissed as a customer?

Bitcoin could potentially be great for paying under the table. Either for the sales rep to give you a lower price on the order or for the sales rep to go the extra mile to ensure the order will turn out the way you want it to. I think the chance of the sales rep accepting this kind of incentive is much higher and safer than the company accepting Bitcoin for the order as it would have all kinds of legal ramifications for you and for them.

The guys from Bitcoin Uncensored exposed this project a long time ago already. It's not anonymous and it's not censorship resistent. The hype is based on the original plans where OB was supposed to be censorship resistent (decentralized shop redundancy) and anonymous (TOR support), which they moved away from. The emperor has no clothes.

Why would that be a selling point? What do you want to buy on OB that you can't at Amazon or other webshops? It isn't censorship resistent because the shops itself are not decentralized... it's hosted on a home computer or rented server. If it gets DDOSed or confiscated the shop is effectively censored.

To save in fees it doesn't matter that you send to a non-segwit address, what matters is that you're sending from a segwit address. So it's just a matter of sending 5 transactions vs sending 6 transactions which means the former is the cheaper choice.
If all 5 different segwit addresses are in the same wallet then you can do it in 1 transaction.

Fair enough, but those are frustrations of the current state of the crypto market compared to the well established stock market. Not necessarily inherent to crypto, but more inherent to the immaturity of the market of a relatively new asset class. Those three properties you mentioned were even worse prior to 2018 and even worse prior to 2014. So the market is improving albeit slowly and while also having to deal with an exponential influx of money and traders.
The high fluctuations and the high risk/reward are directly related, so you will have to accept one if you want to keep the other.

I agree but their actions are not only impacting Coinbase customers but everyone that uses the network which makes the problem bigger as a whole and more worthy of complaint. 
Complaining is part of the process of people moving to competitors and the competitors (and Coinbase themselves) upping their game, so i would say let people complain even if you yourself are satisfied with their services. It should benefit you in the long run too.

Bitcoin is the ledger that goes back all the way to the genesis block as started by Satoshi without contentious hard fork.

You can call things fake all you want, but we're not seeing mass withdrawal problems at exchanges yet and haven't seen withdrawal problems during the run up either which indicates the value has been and is up to this point actually sufficiently backed up with liquid real fiat and liquid real crypto even now that we're in a severe bear market with lots of people cashing out. If things get more ugly than this then maybe we start seeing withdrawal problems partially proving your point but to paint a picture of all demand and all value having been fake is provably not true.

Well ultimately Bitcoin is just chugging along as always, so that's not the problem. Bitcoin is still proving to be anti-fragile. But a single dumb or malicious actor can affect or influence certain aspects of the network which is what we're seeing here. We knew this was possible, it just costs a lot of money to do so which should deter someone from doing it (for long) purposefully. These shenanigans are costing Coinbase a lot of money and they are (partly) pushing off the costs to their customers but are possibly also bleeding money by creating all these addresses with tiny amounts that they can't spend anymore without losses due to the high fees, caused by their own doing.

Wow you really don't get it. Your fork comparison of GNU/Linux or Libreoffice vs Openoffice to a project like Bitcoin and other coins falls flat on its face. It's comparing apples to oranges because centralization and censorship resistance don't matter much in the projects you mentioned while in Bitcoin and other coins it matters a whole lot, absolutely essential one might say.
Hardforking the projects you mentioned are indeed not problematic but a fork of Bitcoin or another coin so that consensus can be reached easier between fewer people definitely is a push for centralization and definitely problematic.

Miners will still mine blocks but the transaction fees will be the only reward.

It's not about them not picking a winner, it's about them as an industry leader using the Bitcoin network unnecessarily heavy and  serving their Bitcoin customers unnecessarily badly, pushing the costs off to them and blaming the network and the network engineers for it. It's like a big energy company polluting the city unnecessarily and charging their customers extra for the costs it causes while blaming everybody but themselves and refusing to update their infrastructure and produce green energy instead.

Words like "bubble", "scam", "ponzi", "pump 'n dump" and "crash" are words that are often used interchangeably but actually all can have different meanings, interpretations and implications.
Bitcoin's price could be a bubble right now, as in the price could be overappreciated. But Bitcoin as a whole is not a bubble, as in something that will pop and die. As a matter of fact; we've seen Bitcoin's price crash and come back several times already. I don't see any reason why that wouldn't happen again after a significant price crash. I can't think of a significant event that would prevent Bitcoin's price from coming back up as long as the network keeps running (people running nodes and people mining) and improving (core devs, other devs, businesses etc. making the ecosystem better). Just like the stock market always keeps coming back up as long as you keep the economy running, growing and improving.
@_date: 2019-07-22 09:08:45




I'm a big fan of Bitcoin too but let's keep it real here. These two statements are not true. The first statement will solve itself in the future as volume and liquidity grows. The second statement will always be problematic with centralized exchanges who are forced to deal with AML/KYC. Decentralized exchanges and other P2P mechanisms are a solution to that but come with trade-offs and still need to grow in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:19:50




They will run into it a bit later because they have bigger blocks, but yes. Their solution is just to keep making bigger blocks which is just kicking the can down the road and introduces other problems such as a much bigger blockchain size as time moves on and higher bandwidth demands for nodes. This is expected to lead to centralization of nodes which makes BCH more vulnerable for a government takedown and out of consensus hardforks. In short; they took the easy route for a short term fix which comes at great costs.
Not mentioning the fact that the general consensus is that the current high fees in Bitcoin are caused by unnecessary spam transactions by an unknown actor. This is concluded by the way these transactions are structured (tiny, heavy and large in numbers) and cannot be accounted for or linked to any real activity. Without these unnecessary spam transactions we wouldn't have a fee problem in Bitcoin even now. But regardless, Bitcoin is permissionless so we have to deal with it now and scaling would've had to be dealt with eventually anyway. We have segwit now which helps the more people use it, and Lightning network will deal with scaling further in 2018 and beyond.
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:29:37
You have to call a spade a spade though. If a coin is pre/insta-mined, centralized, technically bad, proof of stake or has no chance of scaling then you should call it a scamcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:09:56
I think you're interpreting it the wrong way. There's nothing wrong with running nodes in China. The problem is node centralization (54% hosted by one company in one country in datacenters). The other problem is that Bcash is being marketed as a worldwide, grassroots response against Bitcoin Core while instead this statistic is suggesting corporate mining/chip interests from China leading the Bcash charge.

I don't know about Bisq but i remember the problem with OpenBazaar was that the shops and inventory itself were not distributed and thus not decentralized. They decentralized the shopping platform and the discovery but not the shops and inventory itself which didn't make OpenBazaar any more censorship resistant than running a shop on a regular webserver behind Tor.

Yes, you should be transfering to a segwit address and pay less fees after that. However we are also dependant on the adoption of segwit addresses in the network as a whole for further lowering the fees. Last time i checked segwit adoption is currently plateauing at about 10% of the total transactions each block. That's because heavy blockchain users like Coinbase, Blockchain.info and Bitpay still have not finished implementing segwit into their platforms and wallets yet. And ofcourse, the mempool spammer(s) are not using segwit, but that's on purpose and a given.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:35:33


Yes, and why was there a hedge created against S2X not happening in the first place? Hell, why was S2X created in the first place? Because of corporate and individual power interests. Not a genuine grassroots revolution over high fees, slow confirmations and anti-Core sentiments which the shills pretend it to be.
Is there dissatisfaction and concern over high fees? Sure. But anyone who is at least a little bit educated on Bitcoin knows why this is, what is being done about it and that Bcash proponents are responsible for this or at the very least made things worse.

* We're nearing the end of Moore's Law which should result in more decentralized mining soon. Bitmain won't be able to stay ahead of the curve compared to everybody else technologically speaking.
* Even if 77% of all hashing power dissappears overnight, the network's integrity would still be in tact which is what matters most. It may cause a dip or crash in price but the 10 minute on average blocktime should return within a matter of weeks due to the automatic difficulty change. That's not even counting the fact that a lot of people would temperarily fire up old miners again helping the network to a certain extent.

Completely academic? Segwit has been live for months now, Lightning Network is in public testing and Schnorr signatures has existed for many years and just needs to be implemented.
The crypto world acts like it moves fast but it's mostly just smoke and mirrors trying to lure newbies away from Bitcoin. The real innovations are done in Bitcoin or on top of Bitcoin (Lightning Network, MAST, Confidential Transactions, Open-Transactions, atomic swaps, Simplicity, sidechains, drivechains etc.). It takes time to do those things and to do them well because it's high level science and unthreaded territory. This isn't your average software project or website development.

Correct me if im wrong but Bitcoin is the only reason they're able to do what they're doing. 55% of their holdings and obligations is in BTC and they currently only support BTC deposit and BTC withdrawal. Dropping Bitcoin would take away their regulatory advantages, will make their business way more expensive to run and will make them lose half of their customer base and funds. Their company name is freakin' BITreserve. Dropping Bitcoin doesn't make any sense at all. Avoiding the association with Bitcoin from an image and marketing perspective i kind of understand but their business simply relies on it too much to ignore it.

You're talking about embezzlement which is a very specific kind of crime that most people are not even able to commit because they do not have lawful possession of other people's property. Taking only embezzlement as a starting point is a false premise. I also think that only talking about freezing and confiscating property is too limited and should include closing bank accounts, blocking transactions and reversing transactions in the discussion as well. Things that the average Joe is more likely to run into and are just as much of a reason for someone to use Bitcoin. Censorship has a broad spectrum. I may be moving the goalposts here but i think that's what the original poster meant and is certainly more akin to reality.


You're mentioning if there is sufficient evidence which is not a given, and Bitcoin makes that part even harder for law enforcement. So for them to increase the severety of their actions involves more risk at public regulatory backlash and is difficult to uphold over a longer period of time. More severe actions AND less evidence generally doesn't go well together in a free democratic society.






See paragraph 1.


See paragraph 1 again. I am sure they will try to use the less reasonable tools they already currently use but i am arguing that they cannot do that so easily as you make it out to be. There will be consequences due to laws and public pushback, with even less evidence to work with and to back up their actions with. Bitcoin changes the cat and mouse game fundamentally. It makes the game easier for the average Joe and makes the game harder for law enforcement in reality.

That's not how it works though. The kitchen nor the delivery boy get alerted about confirmations. They get the order from Takeway within 1-2 minutes. At that point Takeaway considers it paid, no strings attached, and the communication between the restaurant and Takeaway for that order stops there.
Takeaway takes the risk of zeroconf because despite my home address being known and me not receiving the food in the end the restaurant already put the work and food in which is wasted. The restaurant and Takeaway would have a dispute. If they come knocking on my door i have plausible deniability. Anyone can fill in my home address, pay with Bitcoin and double spent to mess with me.

You're not making it easy for him with your false premise and flawed reasoning. Clearly he prefers jailtime over freezing of his assets because it's easier for your assets to get frozen or confiscated then it is for you to get put in jail and stay jailed for an extensive period of time in the western world.
You're assuming that if freezing is not possible anymore they would make legislative changes to jail and keep someone in jail more easily but that's not necessarily true. Bitcoin ensures that law enforcement has a more difficult task on the legal front and that they have less pre-emptive and strongarming options when it comes to property. Control is the key word here.

Next time you buy something like this you should provide the public address and **encrypted** private key to the merchant yourself.

But there's less incentive to do that because i know 100% certain i wont get the food if i have to pay the delivery boy cash. If i double spend my BTC i might get away with it if the double spend is not caught or not communicated in time. This forces Takeaway to abondon zeroconf and hold the order for atleast 1 confirmation which could drastically increase the delivery time and might even be more problematic with last minute orders (payment confirmed after kitchen closes).

Personally i think it's important to buy/earn enough BTC in a relatively short time to get rid of the fear of missing out on a sudden bull run. How much is enough is different for everybody but once you get to that point you can buy a little bit extra every week/month without worry. Right now my BTC purchases are a lot smaller than they were in the beginning but more frequent and with ease of mind instead of a sense or urgency.

The settlement is hashlocked (which allows the settlement to be undone by a newer agreed upon state) and timelocked (functioning as the deadline), so in your example Bob cannot spend to Carol until the timelock has expired. Or to put it differently; Bob's transaction to Carol won't get accepted into a new block before the timelock ends. Before the timelock ends the settlement can still be undone by a newer agreed upon state thanks to the hashlock.

Sure, bitcoins should become easier to buy all over the world. But more importantly; bitcoins should become easier to EARN. How do most people get their fiat? Not by buying it with other fiat but by earning it. 
We need people who have bitcoins or can easily attain them to pay other people in BTC in return for labor, services, goods etc. The fact that it gets easier and easier to spend bitcoins helps people accepting it. Depending on people exchanging fiat into BTC means depending too much on the current banking system and government regulations.

Apparently i missed the entire debate where it was concluded that Bitcoin should be classified as a currency rather than an asset or a hybrid form / something totally new?
In my view there are pro's and con's to a classification as currency or asset, and neither really fit the bill to what cryptocurrencies actually are.
I think rallying for Bitcoin to be classified as a currency is a big mistake and an easy way out to get regulation for the sake of regulation, which ultimately benefits Bitcoin-businesses and the government the most. 
In my opinion we should be rallying for as little regulation as possible, and the aspects that we do need to regulate should be tailor made to what Bitcoin actually is and should be aimed at maintaining the freedom that Bitcoin brings to the world.

Without the latter i probably would not be interested. But if Bitcoin was just a potential to get rich but had nothing moral and revolutionary about it i also would not be interested in it. That's why i never took interest in the financial market before Bitcoin either. The combination of both are essential for my interest in Bitcoin.

You're comparing apples to oranges. Bitcoin is not the foundation level, the internet is. Creating your own internet would isolate you from the rest of the world while creating your own blockchain would not because it's the internet that gives access to all blockchains while your own internet gives access to literally nothing.
Yes, Bitcoin has first mover advantage but that doesn't neccesarily mean it's stupid to make your own blockchain. Many blockchains will come and go, the majority of them will fail and only a minority of them will be successful or find a niche. Look at Bitcoin as if it's TCP/IP.... there is still room and a usecase for others such as UDP, DNS, PPP, SLIP, ICMP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, Telnet, FTP, LDAP, SSL, TLS and more. Some will piggyback off of Bitcoin and some will not. 
Don't be scared of other blockchains, there can be an ecosystem of blockchains on the internet which is perfectly fine, maybe even prefered if you're being realistic.

In this case the Bitcoin blockchain functions as an impartial 3rd party title record that requires no trust and is accessable to anybody through the internet. It takes away people's fear to register, and puts faith in the title record in the eyes of lenders which takes away the need to charge high interest rates.
Of course, it requires the Honduras government and its citizens to use Factom and accept the Bitcoin blockchain as an authority which is a matter of choice. Technically, they could choose to accept montiporadigitata's documents as the title record but Factom + Bitcoin seems like the better choice here.

I think they temporarily charge zero fees to accelerate adoption and capture market-share. They simply cannot depend on their other Bitcoin businesses to make up for it forever (sorry Rebit, i don't buy it).
This is actually a good move though as you need to incentivize people to start using Bitcoin and become familiar with it in order to grow. Once they are familiar and are happy and experienced the other advantages Bitcoin brings they don't want to go back to WU once the fees are introduced back. This is one of the most important purposes of venture capital; a big pile of cash to lean on in the early stages to make adoption possible and get to the stage where the company can survive on its own two feet.

The reserve is not everything they have. It's just what they hold in reserve (sitting there doing nothing). The money they use for investing, the thing they actually make money on, is not part of the obligations/reserve equation. If Bitcoin would suddenly moon they'd transfer some of that money they have invested to their reserves to become fully reserved again.

It is not "the very definition of money laundering", just something that is conflated with money laundering and in this case not (necessarily) ill intended and just a minor detail.

pros and cons of Uphold.
cons: 
* Minor and Watson don't believe in Bitcoin in the long term and have a general belittling attitude towards it (although Watson recently backtracked on that somewhat, either for PR or he actually wised up).
* The vast majority of their reserve &amp; obligations is in Voxels which inflates their numbers in an absurd way. Their BTC/fiat/PM reserves &amp; obligations is about 15-20% of the total. In practice it doesn't really matter but it is disingenuous PR at the very least.
* Their reservechain and reserveledger provide a false sense of security and transparency. They are in control of the data and their advertised quarterly audits have not been performed or been made public as far as i can tell. They also don't provide proof on the blockchain regarding their BTC holdings.
* easy and cheap way to hedge against currency/PM fluctuations.
* easy and cheap way to send money around if the recipient is also a member.
* cheap way to buy BTC (a little bit more expensive than exchange prices but much cheaper than broker prices).
Correct me if i'm wrong on any of the above. I think their services are still worth using but i wouldn't let them hold too much in value at once. All the value you have on there is an IOU from a single party. Maybe if they start to provide blockchain proof and actual audits i would trust them with more.

It's not hard to define. I'm sure there's information out there about the average home connection speeds/bandwith in the world but i'm too lazy to look it up. Whatever the numbers are, the focus should be on the average or below average to maintain sufficient decentralization. Tough luck for the people with better connections but decentralization is too essential to Bitcoin to mess around with. Slower confirmations isn't ideal but is much less of a problem compared to it.

Keep in mind though that they are not legally allowed to update you on the compliance process and progress. This is to give an edge to law enforcement in case they actually happen to deal with a violation or a criminal. I agree it totally sucks for innocent people though. You see similar things happen with companies like Paypal, Coinbase, Circle, Uphold etc. that are trying to be the most legit and law abiding and are based in non-shady jurisdictions. It doesn't mean Bitgold is completely blameless, their internal processes and attitude towards customers might also be a mess for all i know. Just putting in some highly needed nuance here.

Yes, in the sense that they have been around for a while and the seedbox provider that i use uses them for cryptocurrency payments through their sister company LitePaid. They have legit company registrations in The Netherlands and are backed by incubator/accelerator Crosspring B.V.

I'm not sure why Bitgold gets so much blame for this. They're just following the rules that are put upon them. Their communication about it sucks, yes, but that is also because of the rules. Lack of information and communication is part of the rules to give law enforcement an edge over criminals. If this is really because of AML/KYC then Bitgold doesn't get to keep the money anyway... the government will take it or it will be returned to OP in the end. And if Bitgold is scamming they won't get away it so easily.. they're handling too much money ($1.5billion+), have too many legit customers (from the Goldmoney takeover) and operate under Canadian law. This isn't an igot, GAW or BigVern level operation.

They can't prove it's him. There's no such things as owning bitcoins, only the ability to spend which in theory can be done by anyone. All you need are the private keys which in theory can be held by an unlimited amount of people. Coins moving =/= he moved them.
Obviously, they will still try to hold him accountable when those coins move but whether it will hold up in court depends on how just the laws are in the jurisdiction he's in.

I didn't say anything about the act of sharing private keys, nor about mixing or money laundering. That's not the point. The point is that if they can't prove that i have the private keys and can't prove that i'm the only one that has those private keys then they (arguably) cannot hold me accountable for when those funds go on the move. There is no such thing as ownership in Bitcoin, just ability to spend.

No, the article says there are 7.8 billion Chinese bank accounts while the population of China is 1.4 billion people. That means for every one person there are about 5-6 bank accounts (7.8/1.4). The new rules state that you may now only have one unlimited bank account (Type I) per bank. If you want more bank accounts at that bank you can only have these limited ones (Type II and III).
Basically, they're trying to make things easier to monitor by cutting down the number of unlimited bank accounts and make anonymous capital outflow more difficult in the process. Good news for Bitcoin.

Many Chinese might stop trading or trade much less after today, so you have to be careful drawing conclusions comparing volume before today to volume after today. It's not just that a veil will be lifted after today... the circumstances have changed and will be changed even more if fees are added.

Nope. Don't take the term fork too literal. It's a bad analogy. The Bitcoin Core codebase was copied and used as a starting point for the Bitcoin ABC codebase. The same goes for the state of the ledger; the Bitcoin blockchain was copied and used as a starting point for the Bcash blockchain. A copy is not attached or connected to the original. A copy is its own seperate thing especially when you start altering things and/or tag your own stuff on top of it.

The Kleiman estate wanted to make sure that if CSW speaks the truth about the existence of this trust and his access to those coins that they will get their cut. Now legally, they are owed their cut. Unfortunately for them; CSW doesn't speak the truth. He doesn't have access to those coins. This is probably why CSW now says he will comply... because he knows he can't in perpetuity and there's no risk of him having to pay the USD equivalent or having to pay in any other way. It all hinges on access to those coins.

But as soon as you transfer them away from Circle their responsibility should end right there and then. This is one of the many fundamental problems of the governments in the western world today... that disgustingly long reaching arm.

You're stuck in 2015-2018 shitcoin narrative. A blockchain with a cryptocurrency is not like a social media platform, smartphone or app. It's a value network that needs the best balance of properties that ensure essential characteristics that make it valuable in the first place. Fair distribution, fungibility, decentralization, censorship resistance etc. Bitcoin has the best balance of properties and happens to be the first (thank god).
Besides that, Bitcoin has way more brainpower working on it and has undergone way more testing, code review and real world experience and network effect than any other coin. Those things are very hard to copy.

You're right that a lot of people would cash out because a lot of BTC is held by non-wealthy people at the moment, so if it happens it will happen with a lot of downward pressure after each significant rise. Over time, the already-wealthy will accumulate more and more while the became-wealthy cash out large holdings.
The amount of people that hold BTC right now is a very small portion of the world, so i wouldn't call it "everyone getting rich" by any means. It's just a redistribution of wealth from big capital to non-wealthy early adopters (small portion) and early adopting big capital (big portion).

One of the shitty things about KYC/AML is that companies are not allowed to inform the customer wtf is going on in the background. It's understandable you don't want to inform actual criminals but this also leaves innocent people in the dark about their money which quite frankly is unacceptable and should be changed (even if that means actual criminals are informed also).

I don't think toll is a correct analogy. Bitcoin is basically two things. A money that has a hard cap of 21 million units of which each can be divided into 8 subunits. And at the same time Bitcoin is a commodity that consists of 2100 trillion pieces that can be linked and unlinked from each other at will by whoever is in control of them. Bitcoins are not the toll you pay to put stuff on the ledger, all bitcoins together ARE what make up the ledger.

It's not either-or. You can save a certain amount and also use a certain amount for daily spending. I know that some people just save and don't spend, and that's fine also because it's their BTC so they get to decide what to do with it. It's nobody elses business really. It hurts adoption as a currency but helps adoption as a commodity.
So whether you spend or save or both... you're helping Bitcoin adoption as a currency or as a commodity or both. Either way Bitcoin wins.

UASF was a kind of mass boycott that was necessary and not done on a whim and we all saw how powerful it was. But mass boycotting a wallet or exchange... is that really necessary? Boycotting something yourself.. sure.. but calling for others to boycott is a different ball game.

Just because you can trade CAD for USD doesn't mean it creates USD, it just means you can trade CAD for already existing USD at a market driven rate. Same with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.


FX rates do not increase supply.


That's the hard part right there. And even if you succeed with that, it still wouldn't be real USD. Same with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. All you can do is try to trade your non-BTC for BTC at a rate depending on how much others are willing to give you for it.

Same reason he doesn't add replay protection: because he wants the name, network effect, market cap and userbase of Bitcoin. He doesn't want to be an altcoin. Sadly for him; the userbase decides what the real Bitcoin is. Not him, not the miners, not the exchanges and not the corporate world.

There are actually very few great minds in crypto outside of Bitcoin. Unless you view people like Vitalik Buterin, Dan Larimer and Evan Duffield as great minds. I think they can't even stand in the shadow of most Core devs. Riccardo Spagni, maybe. Not to say that Core devs are perfect or shouldn't be under any scrutiny, but their track record speaks for itself compared to any altcoin developer out there.
Transaction time: the transaction time on chain cannot be instantaneous because the rest of the network needs time to catch up and to slow down the growth of the size of the blockchain. The shorter this time is the less devices can participate due to lack of bandwidth, lack of storage and insufficient hardware which makes the network more centralized. Transaction can be instantaneous off chain however, which Bitcoin is getting in the near future.
Transaction fees: 0 fees are a free lunch and must come at the expense of something. Low fees are so far only achievable at small scale, no altcoin has proven to be able to scale let alone scale while keeping fees low. Keeping fees low at small scale is easy, Bitcoin had that too and still has that during quiet times and without spam attack.

* If it's all fake then how come the other exchanges follow? Maybe Bitfinex/USDT is fabricating bullishness by leading the march but the rest of the world is following and backing it up with real money.
* Trading volume is only low compared to the fake volume from Chinese exchanges prior to earlier this year.
* You don't need $4500 to play around. People can trade fractions of BTC. And don't understimate the amount of people that have savings but are not earning anything on interest on their bank account and are looking at something like BTC as an alternative.
* Not everyone sees Bitcoin as just a currency or just a speculation tool. For many people its a store of value, an escape from government control and for some it's almost a religion.

What's this obsession with preventing a system that is theoretically vulnerable for coercion? Coercion is punishable by law. This is how we already deal with intimidation and force in general aside from voting.
Besides, ballot voting is also vulnerable for coercion. I could force my wife to vote for Party A and have the entire process recorded with a spycam on her clothes to verfify she actually did. If she didn't vote for Party A, rats me out or comes back with no footage at all she's in big trouble.
Blockchain/crypto voting is not coercion-proof but neither are the current ways of voting... we have laws in place to deal with coercion so i don't see how that's a dealbreaker when it comes to blockchain voting or voting from home or mobile. 
To be honest, as a western citizen, i am much more worried about tampering of the voting results than a mass scale coercion attempt. I definitely see a future for crypto signatures and a blockchain making voting better than it is now.

I guess because the creators of GetGems are not rich enough to reward their users BTC, they need to reward a coin that is free of cost to them. I guess also because the whole point is that user participation is translated into value so you need a coin that is exclusively earned through the app and not a coin that originated somewhere else.
But until the app is successful enough for advertisers to be interested enough to advertise on it, the users need other usecases for their gems for it to gain traction. Why else would people go out of their way to acquire gems?

Taringa doesn't have 75 million users; it has 75 million unique visitors a month according to the reference on their Wikipedia page. There are 27 million registered users according to the Taringa homepage counter so the other 48 million are unregistered visitors/readers (not able to earn or give bitcoins). There are about 240k users online right now and judging from the mentioned 300k users in the blogpost this is about average. So realistically we are talking about 300k out of 27m potential users who will be making use of this integration.
Still impressive numbers but not nearly as impressive as the 75 million figure would suggest. Once again, Xapo is overhyping, misrepresenting and being dishonest in their marketing and communications. Please stop doing that.

Large institutions being heavily invested into it decrease the chance of a ban in my view. But yeah i agree it would be a big blow if the US government bans businesses from touching Bitcoin. However it would take a unison effort of world powers to follow suit to truely slay Bitcoin which is unlikely because the world powers have competing interests. Bitcoin is not just a currency it's also an asset, it's global, it's neutral (not tied to any country or institution) and it's on its own rail. It's a potential safe haven and weapon against the US's power and the USD hegemony. Stopping Bitcoin is not like one entity flipping a switch, it's more akin to stopping global warming which doesn't work until all meaningful parties play ball but they don't for tons of different reasons. It's also akin to a fire where you have to deprive it of all its oxygen or else it can keep on burning and spreading/fleeing.

It DOES matter when it comes to the announced Bitcoin integration into the site. The 75 million won't be able to earn or reward bitcoins on the platform, only the 27m registered ones. And of the 27m registered users there are only about 300k active users. It still pretty cool news but using the 75m figure is simply misleading. This, added to the fact that Xapo has a history of misleading and overhyping made it relevant for me to point it out. 
Don't forget that Xapo received one of the highest VC investments in the Bitcoin space so i hold them to higher standards similar to Coinbase and Bitpay. These companies also have their flaws (mostly regulations and KYC related) but have also meant so much for the Bitcoin ecosystem already. If one of them would dissappear tomorrow it would be noticable.. can we say the same about Xapo?
I'm not sure if i should go into your Google Search comparison because it's comparing apples to oranges. You don't need an account for Google Search and the whole point of Google Search is just searching and clicking which is what makes you a user. Google+ is a better comparison actually when is comes to misleading statistics. Everyone with a Gmail account automatically has a Google+ account.. it doesn't mean people use Google+. Yet Google is using the registered accounts figure as a way to make Google+ seem like a success.

Obviously, the police officers know why they sold. This is just the typical Chinese government way of coercing.

Other cryptocurrencies are flawed at foundational levels (pre-mined, centralized, no proof of work, utilities that cause security issues etc.). Bitcoin doesn't do much utility wise out of the box but is solid at its core. Utilities are being added incrementally to its core and is being built on top of this solid foundation through second layer protocols like Lightning Network and Sidechains. 
So with Bitcoin you get the best of both worlds; security and simplicity at its core, utility on top. Most other cryptocurrencies cannot do both. Nor have they proven to be able to scale which is essential to all their claims of utility.

Granted.. Bitcoin is different than any other asset/money/possession and there's no precedent so nobody knows for sure what would happen. But i can imagine that they will hold you accountable as owner of those coins as they can prove those coins were bought with your bank account and there's no trace after that of the coins changing ownership other than the trace on the blockchain. I think "losing them" will not be accepted as a valid explanation depending on how big the value is and the amount of proof you have.

If you bought your BTC at a Dutch exchange it's probably smart to put it in your declaration as those companies file taxes also and can link your identity through iDeal/your bank. If you bought at a foreign exchange or localbitcoins it might be worth the gamble (only if you pass the possessions threshold, ofcourse).

I work for a retail store in the EU and we buy most of our goods directly from China priced in USD. The weakening EUR and the appreciating USD is having significant impact on our business. It has been eating our profit margins and for some goods we are forced to increase selling price, find a way to source it cheaper or stop selling certain models altogether. Many companies are in the same situation. A lot of goods from Asia will become more expensive for everybody, a lot of companies will go bankrupt or will have to lay people off and traveling outside the EU becomes significantly more expensive.
Of course, there are companies, industries and EU countries that notice net positive consequences from this. Export to non-EU and tourism for example. But don't tell me people in the EU will not notice any negative consequences. There's good and bad sides to it but we will all notice it to some degree though some more than others.

Out of all the heavily VC backed Bitcoin start-ups out there, Xapo must be one of the most dissappointing out there. From their debit card Mastercard tie-in and fees debacle to the Satellogic partnership that was announced with a lot of fanfare but was later reduced to a small paragraph on their blog after it failed to create any buzz among the community. 
I guess the company and this industry is still young and they can still recuperate but right now there are tons of better options available when it comes to wallets, vaults and security for the average user. Maybe their enterprise services are a different story? Their track record doesn't inspire hope.

The great thing is that with direct democracy you'd have a higher chance of getting those basic things changed than ever before. Voting for the next republican or democratic candidate surely won't bring you one step closer. But putting these freedoms on the agenda yourself and trying to persuade your fellow citizens to vote for it has a higher chance of succeeding, and is more fair than the systems we currently have from a human rights and personal freedom point of view.

Imagine if there was a currency that didn't need backing nor be affected by any government that may or may not go to shambles. A currency that is not under any one person or organization's control yet usable on a global scale and feasibly safe from manipulation/confiscation/inflation/theft etc as long as certain conditions are met. A currency made up of enormous amounts of computations that cost enormous amounts of electricity and time. That currency is Bitcoin. Its backing is heavily peer reviewed code, laws of nature and decentralization.

First of all, i'm willing to bet that a republican vs democrat presidential vote does not necesarily has the same outcome as a direct legislative ban vs allow weed/guns kind of vote so i think it's a false comparison. Voting for a person or a party is a totally different thing and often a popularity contest with many other factors in play. It does not equal voting for a particular ruling.
In any case, a platform like DemocracyOS would allow you to propose your ideas of free city states with localized law, but you'd still have to persuade a majority (51% or 2/3 or whatever) to vote in favor of your proposal. If you're not able to persuade enough people than i'm sorry.. but you'd have to get back to the drawing board and try again later. If you don't like majority rule then think of something where minority rule has its fair share and convince the majority of this idea. It's all about persuading when it comes to coming to a consensus in a system where everybody has an equal vote.

It's not that easy to replace cheap Asian labor and the massive manufacturing facilities and infrastructure they have there.

This is great. The hunger for volatility and get rich quick is temperarily being satisfied by ETH while BTC price is stable and development continues slow but steady.

I think not many people argue a sudden change in value because of the halving which is set in stone and known beforehand. The value change will be gradual leading up to the halving, and may or may not end in a sudden spike in value due to speculative reasons right before or after the halving. 
tl;dr the gradual change will be because of the halving, the sudden change will be because of speculation. Neither is guarenteed to happen but likely.

DemocracyOS and its movement is trying to change politicians from representatives and decision makers into executors of the consensus of the voters. It would eliminate the possibility of corrupt politicians as they would simply be puppets of the voters. There would still be a possibility of corruption by the voters though (selling their vote for example) but that would much less of a problem and easier to contain. It's much easier to bribe one person than to bribe thousands and thousands of people at once.
With the use of blockchain solutions you wouldn't even need the politicians anymore to execute the consensus of the voters as it would be executed automatically through smart contracts. But that is still a bridge too far at the moment so i can accept this transition period where actual people execute the consensus of the voters.

They require such a mechanism because it lowers the settlement time from 3 days to immediately. The blockchain prevents double spending which makes it possible for the trade to be the settlement. This saves time, money and prevents wrongdoings.

People are always talking past each other in this discussion. Bitcoin and the USD being tied or backed by something is meaningless unless you define it more clearly.

Not only that. The gold industry/gold miners can decide to mine more gold or mine less gold influencing the supply unrestricted. With Bitcoin you can only do that for a short period of time because of the difficulty adjustments that counter-balance a change in hash rate after every x amount of blocks. Supply is limited and stable, only sped up by improvements in hashing technology which are not endless.

We should stop calling it blacklisting coins because coins cannot be individually identified as such. You can only blacklist public addresses and the subsequent flow of its outputs which is why extensive mixing works. Extensive mixing makes it more difficult, expensive and time consuming for analysers to even establish a statistical link, and muddles the water sufficiently to give you strong plausible deniability in case your outputs have been found to have blacklisted addresses in its history.

Scaling concerns shouldn't stop you from acquiring more BTC; LN gives us plenty of headroom for the foreseeable future and its current maximum is not even set in stone yet because it's still so early in its inception. In addition, MAST and Schnorr will improve scalability. More long term scaling possibilities are other 2nd layer or 3rd layer solutions and increasing the blocksize.
