Pretty sure he’s not shilling visa. If anything, he’s shilling the cash app, which is a decent on-ramp for buying BTC with USD, especially for the less experienced buyers out there. This is a good thing for BTC.

I'm talking about buying BTC with fiat, not selling BTC for fiat. I would never sell BTC to add cash to that card, I just add regular fiat when I use that card, and sometimes I use some of that fiat to buy BTC on their app. Simple. And yes, by using a visa, you are giving money to the banks, but most places, I can't use my BTC to pay, and I don't really want to with it so undervalued. You actually can't send BTC to the cashapp anyway, you can only buy and sell what you have purchased within the app, and withdraw to an external BTC wallet (which you should do, always).

Many would say it is still early! Time will tell.

Agreed. I feel like adoption is coming, and people are trickling in as it gets easier. But still early. I can only speak for myself, but once I learned what the technology had to offer, and how it worked I was hooked. It’s just so f***ing cool. The more I’ve learned the more inspired I have become. All I hope is others feel the same way when they learn what all this ‘blockchain’ stuff is all about.

I realize the post is a bit misplaced. Obviously bitcoin is not used on visa cards, and yes, bitcoin is used from/to bitcoin wallets, but people don't just have bitcoin, they need to buy it somewhere with the currency they DO have, then transfer it to a bitcoin wallet (I keep 99% of mine in cold storage). Not sure how else you would get your hands on BTC or other crypto (I would love to know how). That's all I mean with the on-ramp part. This can be done with the app associated with this card, that's all I'm saying. He probably should have mentioned this in his post, as to not confuse people (although he may be confused himself).

I really enjoyed what he had to say when he was talking with Joe. Worth a watch or listen.

Exactly. You don't get to buy low without dealing with some nervousness or worry IMO. This psychology applies to almost every investment/opportunity I can think of (at least for me). Love the enthusiasm. Keep it coming.

Not totally clear this is what is happening yet IMO. We haven’t dumped back to previous levels by any stretch. This ‘dump’ you’re referring to could just as easily represent a bear trap from where I sit right now. 
Just my two sats. Guess we’ll know in a few days (or tomorrow morning knowing how things go).

All the FUD that is being written with any movement up these days just makes me more bullish. All of it lacks substance.

Mods banned him for a few weeks for posting his songs. Poor timing if you ask me.

Makes sense. Thanks for the info. Appreciated.

Hahaha I’ve thought of this scene in relation to bitcoin many times, not sure exactly how it relates, but money is so rarely dealt with in sci-fi that it jumps out.
