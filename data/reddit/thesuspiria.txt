You are just asking to be screenshotted. When the price reaches 50,000+ then people will show this comment. Plus, you are probably the last person anyone should be listening to about Bitcoin knowing your history of always having it wrong.

What if Tesla has bloated their stock price and they turn out like Enron? Like I understand that the referral system is a complete pyramid scheme, and that is where these youtubers are making their majority income. But at the end of the day, others and myself are taking out interest when it accrues out of bitconnect and the capital after the period. 
Bitpetite didn't have a coin that is getting traded and there wasn't much proof of people actually getting paid. Both of those things are opposite to what Bitconnect has shown.

What's steady? It's rising now after not rising the whole fucken day.

And that's when you start using a little featured called brain that came with your human body. You move to a lower living cost area... and spend less... which results in your money lasting longer! yay

Lol have the mentally challenged joined the subreddit now?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:45:24
But people are pulling interest out of Bitconnect every day and many have had their capital returned also. How is it scammy?

State IDs are like $20 here if over 20. But they may take just any other ID with your picture on it with your name? idk
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:50:15
lol but they were already multi-millionaires.

Okay 11 year old
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:15:54
Why would it be weird if it is to confirm your identity with the ID that you provided?

Yep and the only solution is for all humans to kill themselves for the environment and animals to be normal.

A lot of us liked Wikileaks, a lot of us also liked Kimdotcom for Megaupload. Then the two characters started becoming shady as fuck. I'm going to guess a couple of Russians offered to back both of them to keep the U.S. from extraditing them.

This goes hand in hand with a lot of our accounts being dropped to a $50-$100 a week withdrawal limit this past week. This was planned out and thought through.

They pumped enough to short... $15,000 is not the regular price of bitcoin before this...

Who cares about debt as long as you have the strongest military on the planet? Plus, I'm guessing you haven't looked at China's minimum wage yet. Oh wait let me guess, you support a low $300/month minimum wage in China but in America let's raise it to $15/hour. But then you wonder why China has a better competitive advantage lmao. India and China are powerhouses due to cheap labor. Undocumented workers in the U.S. get paid more than Chinese workers in China.

The point he is making is that if you’re bitching about 15% in bitcoin enough to make a post, then you must be new to bitcoin. 15% loss is nothing when it comes to bitcoin.
