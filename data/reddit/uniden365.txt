Your dad has ~35 lb of silver...
I hope he has a working vehicle during the end times, because that's gonna be a pain to pack around.

As block rewards decrease, miners who are not profitable at the new rate of income will reinvest in higher efficiency equipment or stop mining.
As there are less miners, the network slows, and fees rise to compensate. Eventually a new equilibrium is reached where miners are profitable again.

Makes perfect sense.
Sure, they must comply with the law, and might even want to see OP punished depending on how heinous his crimes are.
But it's just good for the market as a whole if those assets are held as crypto rather than being sized by the feds.

Focusing on improving yourself is the best advice to give most folks.
You think people who don't have their shit together can criticize societal structure? That's nuts!

Society is downstream from the individual.
Society will always reflect the pathologies of the individual.
To fix society, you first fix the individual, then your family, then your community.
Expecting society to fix the individuals within is the lazy way to side step the difficult work of changing yourself.

No, doubles were disabled the last time I was there and that was at least 6 months ago.

Sorta, they disabled doubles because there were huge amounts of shitposting related to doubles, and this would count as shitposting.
