Lol, they deleted all the comments over there. It was like watching your parents get into a fight while your friends were over just trying to play a game.

The value of bitcoin has chained so fast these last couple weeks. I can't imagine how anyone could spend it/ accept it for payment.

You could have gone 10 to 50 with a single trade. Thousands sound like you are trying waay waay too hard.

Smart people have a better chance of being able to afford it, let alone investing in the future.

It's not like they can turn it on for small sections of users or regions. There tech department is not having a good time.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:00:07
You may be underestimating the amount of traffic they get. "Scaling" is clearly a complicated issue when it comes to all tech products.
Doing it right is more important than doing it fast.

a year like this, you'd actually have to try to lose money.

And at the same time people were attempting to sue coinbase for not letting them have access to their forked coins.

I don't assume to know why their website shut down, do you?
Is everyone that declares bankruptcy evil?

if you read enough comments, you'll eventually read every sentence that can exist.
also, people love to say i told you so.

I mostly agree with you, so I hate to be negative but "As a community trying to heal the world", might be a bit of an overstatement.

Also Icecream! We know they still have some bitcoins left. The least they can do is buy us icecream. Any other demands, let's make a list!

They're still off by about 40 billion yen.

If enough people do this it'l heavily bring down the prices on the other exchanges, assuming they cash out right away.

Why assume Gox is evil?
It's not just a company, but a group of random nerds who set out to help people exchange magic cards. By making a company an entity, it seems to be so easy to claim they have a single agenda in mind. Is reddit good or evil or simply random individuals with their own thoughts and will and ethics.
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:56:00
They can make more money by running a legit business, than a quick short-term gain. Trying to fix their problems is exactly what they are doing now.
@_date: 2014-01-18 01:11:55
say they were able to buy up a large portion of the coins before most of the price spike. 80% of 12million coins is 9.6million coins. We'll give them a low average price of 200$ per coin. That's 1.92billion$ usd. Maybe?

Is this subbreddit for fans of bitcoin, or a place to discuss bitcoin? I can never truly tell.

They use the software that is written for them. They can choose to use it in bad ways. And, developers can choose to mitigate or cut off those things from happening.
Windows Users don't have control of windows, they can simply comment on it and pray those comments are heard. Not buying windows at all, might push its development differently. But, since bitcoin software is free, it can't be pushed in that same way.
Some will say you simply need to bribe the developers, and that's always possible. But a lot of really smart people, have some pretty strong ethics.

When bitcoin was 5$ a coin, where did you even buy them from? I remember a lot of shady websites in those early days.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:41:56
Coinbase is just trying to please it's users. They've been forced to support these forks as a result of people crying fowl over not getting their "free coins". They definitely are not leading the charge on these things, just trying to sweep up the dead bodies.
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:15:25
Websites do a whole lot of things without consent. Would you rather they only sold your personal info? This really doesn't stand out.

How much of a risk was that 10k for you? I can't imagine having that much cash sitting around in highschool.

It's stupid simple. 
Don't ever sell it for a loss.
And don't ever buy it with money you need for other things.
Then your only regret is not making as much as you could have.

The first time i heard about bitcoin, i thought it was farmville currency. If only i played more farmville.
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:27:17
That's what I was assuming. 
Doesn't that make 2FA, really just 1F phone authentication. Which is actually way less secure than if they were forced to use a backup email instead. Which would hopefully also use another email as backup. Seems like phone 2FA made everything worse.

Selling at 2800 and rebuying at 2400 isn't exactly a bad strategy.
