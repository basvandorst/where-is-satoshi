This is a very good question, and I restate that this is for INFORMATIONAL purposes only, but I will get back with you on this with more information tomorrow when I talk with my colleagues.
At first glance I would have to say no as the ERISA Sec 1104(a)(1)(C) states that the fiduciary, which would be you in this case, must:
diversify "the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so"
Bitcoin is extremely risky and therefore you stand a very reasonable chance to lose everything. As such, in my opinion, you would not be performing your fiduciary duties for the trust. However, there may be a way for you to build an appropriate risk profile, but I am unsure without more information and that is beyond the scope of this forum :). Either way, I will talk with my tax law colleagues tomorrow and ask their opinion.
Please feel free to take this information to your CPA and then form a decision then.

This is a great question, but you probably wont like the answer. I've researched this topic for a while and could not find any guidance.
The general rule with the IRS is that everything is a taxable event unless explicitly stated otherwise.
As I have yet to find a law or example that closely matches mining, such an event is taxable and you would be required to pay taxes on the value of the bitcoin at the time of mining.

Ok buddy, as promised here is an answer to your question:
If you are able to get in close contact with your friend, the first thing you should ask him is "when did you first get bitcoins" The reason for this is that the IRS generally follows what is known as a "First in First out" principle for securities, and his holding period will carry to you during the gifting process.
This can work to your advantage by the following:
If he has some documents, either from the block chain or bank statements or statements from the coin broker, that prove that he has had bitcoins for over one year then you would use the FIFO method and carry forward his basis and you would be subjected to long term capital gains treatment. This means a huge difference that can leave you with no tax liability on the gain if you are not above the 15% tax bracket ($36,250 AGI for single payers in 2013)
If he is unable to provide specific documentation, you can estimate the date, but if the IRS asks for documentation you are out of luck.
Hope this helped!

BTC and mBTC would be the same in the eyes of the IRS
Now, the holding period should depend on if you mined or purchased the bitcoins.
If you purchased the bitcoins, you should be able to trace which bitcoins were sold and trace what date and price you bought them at. The purchase price will be your tax basis, or the number which you base your gain off of.
The holding period matters because if you hold the item for a year and a day, then you are eligible for long term capital gains treatment. Otherwise, the income would be classified as ordinary income and subject to the higher income tax rates.
If you cash out at a gain, you will pay the gain on those bitcoins. If you repurchase your new basis will be what you purchased the bitcoins at. If you sold the bitcoins at a loss then you might have a "wash sale" where you cant claim the loss on the bitcoins.
If you mine, the price of the bitcoin does not matter, and the holding period would not matter at all as you are technically extracting resources, which would be classified as income from a business (at least in my opinion).

That primer is a very very good primer and will give you a great idea about where to start with the tax implication of your coins. I am with the author in that currently bitcoins are not classified as a currency, but instead as an asset, and I take it one step further by classifying mined bitcoins as similar to extracted resources (such as oil and gold). However, if you read nothing else from that primer, the  takeaway from the article would be to keep adequate records.
I don't think you are wrong at all. Explain the similarities between bitcoin and securities and if you have mined bitcoin, explain how it is similar to mining gold or drilling for oil. He will understand, and most importantly, there are no concrete regulations for bitcoin as of yet, but there are enough regulations that are similar to bitcoin that you can make a good faith estimate.
Bitcoin is here to stay, and us accountants must adapt and assist our clients in making the correct decisions.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:15:51
Yes, but understand that short term capital losses are limited to 3,000 per year.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:51:05
All the security experts and foreign transaction experts are away for thanksgiving unfortunately but here is my logic from last night. If bitcoin is classified as a security, this bartering should be classified as income for the business under IRC 61. If so, the basis should be the FMV of the item sold, as no reasonable person would buy an item for more than its worth and no reasonable person would sell an item for less than its worth. So, if the item is sold close to cost, then it might be possible for a business to use bitcoin to minimize their tax liability by holding bitcoins and selling them off to match their business expenses if the bitcoins continue to appreciate. This should allow a business to have zero tax liability UNLESS bitcoins are classified as a currency instead of a security.
Either way, it is great for the bitcoin cause. If the IRS classifies bitcoin as a currency instead of a security then it legitimizes bitcoins in the eyes of the government. 
I am picking my partner's and colleagues brains at the moment and no one has a clear answer. There will be a whole slew of tax laws and regulations to clarify bitcoins in the near future I believe. Us accountants who are researching this will be few and far between, but very necessary for the community.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:19:10
I bounced this off a few of my colleagues as well. They agreed that you would record revenue at the FMV of the item sold in dollars, just as if they paid in dollars. This would be the tax basis of the bitcoins, and would be a taxable transaction. There are many court cases, but United States v. General Shoe Corp., 282 F.2d 9, 12 (6th Cir. 1960). is generally the cited case law for bartering transactions. 
The IRS has produced many memos for bartering transactions, but the meat of it all can be summed up by their chief counsel in this sentence:
"Taxpayers that engage in bartering transactions are treated as if they had received cash for their goods or services in an amount equal to the value of goods or services received and then used that cash to purchase goods or services from the other party to the exchange."
Now, for accounting purposes, you would have the bitcoin as an asset then have a separate account "unrealized gain/loss on bitcoin transactions." It is extremely important to record the date that you received the bitcoin and have third party documentation as backup. If bitcoins are classified as a security, and you hold them for longer than one year, you will qualify for long term capital gains treatment in the event that you sell them for dollars or exchange the bitcoins for goods or services at a later date. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:48:22
Short term capital gains taxable at ordinary income rate, whatever that may be.

If the coins have been sitting idle for years, it might be easier to set the basis at 0, as bitcoins were basically "worthless" two years ago, and move forward with better record keeping. The problem is going to be proving that the coins existed for more than one year in order to get preferential tax treatment. This is a broad overview of what you can do, and might not be the best for your situation.

IF and ONLY IF the sale occurs in the same taxable year. Otherwise, if Bitcoin tanks next year, he is stuck with the tax bill and no cash to pay it.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:09:07
A holding period of one year will give you capital gains.
Now, here is where it gets a little tricky. You will have to know your donors holding period and basis to give you the most accurate rate. If your donor can give you the information on when the coin was created or bought then you can add on his holding period on to your holding period to figure out if you qualify for long term capital gains.
I assumed 0 basis and holding period because you may not be able to easily contact your donor. 
It is a little bit confusing, and Ill be glad to explain it further after I get off work.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:46:39
This is a very good point. Barter transactions are classified as income. If you make ~~money~~ a gain off a transaction, no matter how, its income.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:48:31
I believe the market for this will be huge. Crypto-currency is a completely new area for the IRS. It will take a bunch of private letter rulings, regulations, and court cases to come up with concrete laws, but for now, in my opinion, it is best to think of Bitcoin in two areas
Mining -- similar to any extraction activity
Purchase -- similar to the purchase of any other asset.
The laws will get a whole hell of a lot more complicated in regards to transferring assets overseas
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:48:08
You are thinking 100% correct buddy. You would be liable for the tax bill with no cash if you sold NOW and repurchased later then sold if the coin tanks next year. You are unable to carry back this loss to offset your gain in separate tax years!
Find a lawyer and an accountant in your hometown. You need to do this as soon as possible.
The very first thing I would do is setup an S corporation and make a 351 election by transferring your bitcoin into the corporation. This might give you the ability to carryback operating losses if structured correctly. However, this will be tricky as you will more likely than not be a regulated investment company and therefore unable to carryback your losses.
Get a lawyer and an accountant that you can talk to daily to help you set this up properly.
It wont cost you much at all (maybe 3k).
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:18:28
If you have not spent the coins for anything, then you have no tax liability. It is only when you barter them that you have a tax liability. 
If you cannot prove that the coins were there for a year, put your best estimate on your 8949 or schedule D, with the knowledge that if the IRS reviews your return you will be unable to prove that they existed for one year and you will have to pay tax on ordinary income, but that may not be as devastating as it appears! Lets run through the numbers.
Let us assume that you sold the BTC at $600 and let us assume that you were donated 10BTC. Let us also assume that you are at the highest tax bracket, 39.6% (400k+ Adjusted Gross Income) and your business is operating at a profit before the donation of the bitcoins.
Your tax liability if you bartered the bitcoins for goods if you have no documentation will be the following:
Income Received: 10*600 = 6000
Tax Liability = 39.6%*6000 = 2376
With long term capital gains: 20%*6000 = 1200
1176 dollar difference in tax liability. However! This is assuming the absolute worst case, mainly that you are operating not as a corporation and receive over 400k in income per year and you are already operating at a profit and have no other expenses to offset the donation.
I don't think that's true as you need donations so lets assume a middle ground: 28% tax bracket --
Tax Liability = 28%*6000 = 1680
With long term capital gains: 15%*6000 = 900
A 780 dollar difference. Not as bad.
Now, if your business is currently operating at a loss, you can use the expenses to offset the gain and pay no taxes! It all depends on your situation.

From the regulations:
 *c. De-Centralized Virtual Currencies*
*A final type of convertible virtual currency activity involves a de-centralized convertible virtual currency (1) that has no central repository and no single administrator, and (2) that persons may obtain by their own computing or manufacturing effort.*
In my opinion, this describes mining.

"Illegal income" is still taxable under the I.R.C. Its how the federal government can get drug dealers when they do not have any other evidence. Lets assume that the securities are "illegal" if these "illegal instruments" have the form of securities, then the IRS will more likely than not treat them as securities and value them under Publication 550. Under I.R.C 61, income is taxable under **ANY** source derived, so gains on these securities, once realized, will be taxable.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:19:28
I would say yes.

I specialize in client services, such as consulting, legal and tax. The following is for informational use only. Please consult your accounting professional before making any financial transaction.
The IRS will all income on whatever source derived. You will be liable for the gains on bitcoin, as your basis, as you describe was 10-30
Substantively, you had Bitcoins valued at 10, they increased in value, you then substantially "sold them" to a third party for an item worth $1000. 
The tax liability will be the gain on the Bitcoins less the tax basis (cost of bitcoins).
Your tax liability will depend on if you held the Bitcoins for one year.
It helps to keep good records as to the exact date the coins were mined or bought. This way you can get an accurate basis. If you haven't done so already, you might want to start keeping records of these transactions.

Bitcoin has created quite a few wealthy people, and Believe me, the IRS wants what is theirs. Not only can they look at discrepancies in tax returns, but neighbors, friends and family can and will report you. It happens all the time. As an aside, the whistleblowers get 10% of whatever penalties the IRS collects.
Also, as an FYI -- Banks are required to report deposits in excess of $10,000. 
I strongly discourage against trying to pull one over on the IRS, and highly recommend that you seek out a knowledgeable, local CPA if you have a substantial amount of BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:29:59
I would love it. It takes out all of the problem of finding records from the client. The blockchain is just one big general ledger. I could use coding "magic" and pull out everything that the client did and find out EXACTLY how much he spent and where he spent it.
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:59:52
Yup. 
However, this fact is more of a burden for individuals. Businesses already do this kind of record keeping. I believe that bitcoin will make their bookkeeping easier as they can always reference the blockchain for the values of transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:46:20
This is up in the air now for the IRS. I am of the thought that the IRS will treat bitcoin as a commodity for the near future, so if you hold it without selling it or exchanging it for goods or services, you will not have a tax liability. You would have to report the gain in your Schedule D if you exchanged the coin for goods, services, or fiat currency.
However FinCEN has very clear regulations for the mining and transmission of cryptocurrencies:
Miners who sell bitcoin and websites that facilitate the transfer of bitcoin to fiat currency must abide by these regulations.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:38:01
This is where separate wallets helps. 
If your coins are in one wallet and purchased at the same time, then all of the coins from that wallet would have the same basis. 
You should be able to pick and choose which wallet you sell from, so long as you keep very good records to backup your statements.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:38:38
You are assuming that the fiat for the gain less tax for the trading is less than the buy and hold strategy. For the majority of people, your philosophy may be correct, but it is on a case by case basis.
Assuming the following:
1) The individual already has an AGI over 450,000.
2) The individual purchased bitcoin at $4 one year and a day ago and sold today at $700
The tax liability for the coin holder by the buy and hold strategy will be roughly 139.2 per coin with a post tax gain of 556.8. If the average gain per coin is above this tax liability, then his strategy works as all of the gains are summed
In the above scenario, if the average gain per coin is 921.86 or above, then he will make more money by day trading. This number will change depending on the individuals true AGI.
Edit: had to finish a quick task.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:06:23
The IRS generally issues guidance only when different tax practitioners give inconsistent opinions, or if there is no settled case law to draw from. The first situation will most certainly occur for 2013 tax returns.
We should see some regulations next year, maybe in Q3.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:32:47
Yes. Also, you will need some supporting documentation such as bank statements that show a withdraw of $X at a date of Y. If you have that documentation and can trace the coin, you might be able to use specific identification.
Separate wallets would be very helpful here.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:40:12
I would say that this would be a non-taxable like for like exchange, as you are exchanging one crypto-currency for another. You would have to be sure to record your original tax basis and carry that forward to your new crypto-currency. Publication 550 gives some guidance for similar exchanges, but there is nothing exact like bitcoin.
After thanksgiving, i will do another one of these and be able to answer your question more thoroughly.

Specific ID is the best if you are able to document it, through the blockchain or separate wallets with your spreadsheet and bank statements. 
But baring that, you are unfortunately stuck with FIFO, as LIFO isn't used for securities, and I believe that is what the IRS will most likely classify bitcoin as at the moment.
Id try your hardest to document your transactions to get the specific identification method.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:07:26
Your tax basis would be the same, whether or not the value of the coin rises or falls. Tax basis, in its most general definition, is the cash you paid for an asset.
In the problem above, the TOTAL value of the gain was 900, but because we are only using 1/10 of the value of the bitcoin to purchase an item, we only have to recognize 1/10 of the gain.
Lets find the gain for your question:
It is easier to create a side ledger of how many bitcoins we have alongside the current gain:
5/1/2013: BTC price is at 500.
Number of BTC: 9.9
Cost of BTC: 100
Tax Basis of BTC: 9.9*100 = 990
Current Market Value of BTC: 9.9*500 = 4950
Taxable Income: 4950-990 = 3960
For ease of calculation, lets convert these values to single coins:
Taxable Income = (4950-990)/9.9 = 400
So our taxable gain on ONE coin is 400
We are buying $100 of goods when the value of the coin is at $500, this means that we are buying 1/5 or .2 of the value of a coin.
This means that we have to report 1/5, or .2, of the taxable income of ONE coin or...
.2*400 = 80 in taxable income that must be reported to the IRS
You can use the above calculation to get a good approximate estimate on the amount you will have to report under "Other Income" on your tax returns if you so happen to do your own.
Hope that helps.

Ah, good question.
The sales tax is state level and city/county level. That tax is separate from federal income tax.
Basically, the IRS taxes anything that creates value. More specifically, income is taxable from **whichever source derived**. Meaning, if you spend (barter) bitcoin on goods or services, that is a taxable event, or you can say the gain is realized.
How this tax is calculated is as follows:
Lets say you bought bitcoin two months ago at $500 and purchased a gyft card at $1000. Your gain will be the market value of your coin at time of purchase less your basis basis (what you paid for it).
Lets use the numbers above:
You purchase a $100 gyft card.
This is 1/10 of a coin (100/1000), so your gain will be:
1/10*(Price of bitcoin at time of sale - basis) or --
You should report a gain of $60 on your schedule D under short term capital gains (the top part). This gain is taxable at your tax bracket rate (anywhere from 0 to 39.6%)
However, lets change the date of purchase from two months to a year and a day and keep everything else equal for simplicity.
Your gain will stay the same, but you will report it under the long term section (bottom part) and pay a tax rate of anywhere from 0-20%.
Either way, the gain will be taxable as transactions from bitcoin is considered income.

The following is for informational use only. Please consult your accounting professional before making any financial decisions or transactions.
First, bitcoin is not anonymous. The IRS can look at the blockchain as easily as you or I can. The second they make a department to look at the blockchain, I can assure you that they will attempt to find the major players and ensure that they are paying their taxes.
There are no 1099's afaik for bitcoin transactions, but if you are making a substantial amount of cash, the IRS will notice items on your tax return, such as mortgage interest deductions, and match that number with people in your reported income range. If you are out of that range they will request supporting documentation for income, bank statements and the like.
I gotta put this here now :( 
In compliance with IRS Circular 230:
Any statements or tax advice that are contained in this message are not intended or written to be used, and
cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer.

The following is for informational use only. Please consult your accounting professional before making any financial transaction.
Mining is, at least in my opinion, similar to any other extraction activity. In other words, you will not have any tax basis on any new coin except the costs that you incurred extracting said coin (such as electricity, overhead, depreciation on equipment, rental). 
Lets say that you got lucky and got 50 coins today on your work computer. Your basis would be 0 as you paid nothing into getting the coin. You would be liable for the value of the coin (once sold for USD or for purchases) less your basis (0)~~, or~~
In other words, you would have to pay tax on the full value of the coin.

Yes, 
The losses for bitcoin should be deductible against ordinary income up to 3000. However, you must be sure to classify the loss as long term or short term as you can only deduct short term capital gains with the short term capital losses, and vice-versa.

The following is for informational use only. Please consult your accounting professional before making any financial decisions or transactions.
That is considered income in the eyes of the IRS. The IRS will tax income from *whichever source derived.*
You received an item from bartering, even though that item was not paid for in "cash" in the real sense, it was paid for by something with value. Income is income, and you will be liable for the taxes for the full value of the bitcoins on the date you exchanged them.
The tax rate will depend on how long you held the donated bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:00:57
There is a lifetime exclusion of 5.25 million for gift tax, so chances are you will not have to worry about that. 
The most important part is the basis of the coin once it is sold. Once the giftee sells the coin for USD, or uses the coin for goods or services. The giftee will have to pay taxes on the gain based on the tax basis of the coin.

A more careful reading of the code sections leads me to 162/183 and publication 550.
For simplicity's sake lets assume that the IRS classifies bitcoin as a security.
The basis of the bitcoin should be the value of the bitcoin.  If it is considered passive income, as bitcoin was not his trade or business, then he should be able to deduct the expenses associated with the creation of the bitcoin, unfortunately below the line :(
However, if the individual is an early adopter bitcoin is a profitable hobby, so 183(d) will kick in.
For businesses primarily engaged in mining bitcoin, 183 obviously wont apply and instead  1001.
I think, for most people, 183 will apply and mined coins will be considered income with deductions taken below the line. Personally, I would suggest miners keep good records and make financial statements to show profitability so that this income can be deducted above the line. I do not think the block chain analysis here will be good enough. Miners need to start operating their operations in a business like manner so that they do not get hit by 183.
Id like to bounce more of this stuff off ya also. None of my partners or managers have any idea what to make of bitcoin.

Without knowing more, I wont be able to comment on his specific situation, but he would, if he wants to get the highest basis, amongst other things, apply the correct depreciation, power consumption, and apply the correct amount of overhead on the mined coins, apply a first in last out philosophy on said mined coins that were sold, and be sure that those exact coins can be traced back to the blockchain with adequate documentation in the event of an IRS audit. It might be too much work for too little reward.
Unfortunately, in order for me to definitively say what is the best course, I would have to know a whole heck of a lot more, and that would require a bit more formality than reddit.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:57:27
My logic for the physical mining is as follows:
There is a finite amount of coin (resources) available. The coin exists, but work must be performed to get the coin. This is similar in nature to E&amp;P companies or physical mining companies who must perform physical work to extract the resources. The resource has a value once extracted, but not before. 
I argue that the expenses directly derived in the virtual extraction of the currency are similar in nature to the physical extraction of minerals, and all costs associated with the extraction may be matched with the coins produced and taxable only at the time of sale. However, this assumes that the coins will be classified not as a currency, but as a commodity similar to gold. If it is a currency then the full value of the coin at the time of extraction is taxable.
I will pull up a few sources and rulings once I am through with a few things I am doing now.

BTC isnt like a regular security as you cant sell one-half a share of google, but you can easily sell one half of a bitcoin. Think of BTC transactions like using gold, except easier.
Lets step through the transaction
1/1/2013 -- Purchase 10 BTC @ 100
2/1/2013 -- BTC Value increases to 1000
2/1/2013 -- Purchase Goods with a fair market value of $100 with BTC
At this point, you have income and must report the gain on the BTC.
Lets step through the gain -- 
Basis = $100 (value of the purchased BTC)
Gain = (1000-100)*.1 = $90
You must record income of $90 for the purchase of the item. 
4/1/2013 -- BTC falls to 500, no gain or loss recorded
The fall in value at 4/1/2013 will have no effect on your earlier transaction and will have no effect on your tax liability until you choose to redeem your bitcoins for goods or services or cash.
