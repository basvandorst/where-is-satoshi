Again, if the feds are drilling open my safe deposit box I would have bigger problems than a couple of bitcoin disappearing.

This is a pretty reasonable theory for what happened at Gox. It was flawed logic for them to operate at a fractional reserve, however. I hope they rot in prison just as I hoped that the big bank CEOs would rot.
Failure and irresponsibility of this magnitude is, simply, not acceptable.
Long live Bitcoin.

Please let it drop, I want to buy more!

How did the supply go down? If it were stolen for profit that coin will be on other exchanges. If it is simply a matter of deciding how to divide up the remains then it will go back to some people who deserve it and will then go onto other exchanges.
Its not like they dropped it in a wallet and lost the key.

Colossal incompetence is tantamount to theft in this situation. There is no "oops, I didn't mean to lose all of that money you trusted me with so you should probs just forgive me." There is only justice, putting him in a federal pound-him-in-the-ass prison for 30 years. Thats what happens when you defraud people out of this much money.
Unless, of course, you want to treat him like the fat cat CEO's  of the banking industry that we hate so much. What hypocrisy! If letting them off wasn't fair then neither is letting him off. I hope he rots.
BTW, I lost exactly zero of my money at gox because I left as soon as there was even a whisper of slowed withdrawals, months ago.

If the NSA can break encryption like this then I have bigger issues than my small Bitcoin stash. As a PhD student in mathematics I fully understand the risks I am taking.

I'd be happy to own some Yahoo! stock!

I think an efficient solution that recovers the private keys comes with a pretty obvious, built-in, bounty...

I'll consider it my contribution to the advancement of mankind when you take it.

I don't think people who think that "people who enjoy technical matters" are the only ones who ought to enjoy crypto. I certainly don't think that an audience of about 5 million motorsports fans is completely comprised of dumb hicks who couldn't benefit from crypto.
Try not to be such an elitist prick.

Good riddance. Bitcoin doesn't need to be anchored to an institution handled by amateurs.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:05:24
Probably not. I'm so sick of these alarmist, vague headlines. I didn't even read the story, that's how sure I am that it contains zero content.

Buying a little to average down. I believe in bitcoin's potential and resilience.
If things turn out the way I believe they will this will just another event on the long bitcoin timeline known as the "Mt. Gox crash". It will take a while to recover, but it will.
I don't know who is selling, except for people who see bitcoin as a short term investment. It is certainly not those who have been on board for years, suddenly giving up because some institution failed. 
Bitcoin is safe. The protocol is its value, not its price. When the dust clears, it will still be there, a cutting edge and revolutionary option.
