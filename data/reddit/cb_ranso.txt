I know a lot of people are super confident about 100k, and frankly, I am as well, but *if* it does hit 100k, I can't want to have the biggest shit-eating grin when I share that information with my family and friends.

Warren? My man, you can just look at the guy and see he's not 70.

I believe the idea is that it's still not dead. It didn't die then and it wont die now pretty much.

That’s the fun!

I’m so glad I’ve been able to tame my emotions with this shit. Watching it go up or down is exciting now.

Don't know if you're trolling or not but just in case you aren't, sorry you're getting downvoted and that I wouldn't hold my breath for ≤$1000 Bitcoin price at this point.
Obviously it *could* happen, but at this point, I think the general likelihood of that happening is extremely small. If you are interested, jump in now or keep an eye on it. It's always best to buy the dip but 'time in the market is better than timing the market.'

People don't know how to zoom out and look at the bigger picture.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:13:04
This is great to hear but do some research as well while you’ve got some!

When I see “huge drop” I zoom out a little. Right now we’re up from just a week ago. I’m still pretty new to really believing in Bitcoin but I’m becoming more immune to drops emotionally. Time to HODL and wait.

"It's dead"
I hate that shit. Only the ignorant and people who don't know what they're talking about think that Bitcoin's actually dead.

I understand risk, even though Bitcoin has a solid track record, but I still have friends that think Bitcoin’s a complete sham..... like...? Are you kidding me?

I started out the same. I actually spent about $400 on the come down from ATH at $6k. After it started to drop further I said "Ah shit I'll just hold until I can at least break even."
It started approaching my principal again so I did more research on Bitcoin. Not only did I hold I went ahead and put another $1k into it. I'm pretty convinced by the technology now and can see my self holding through the good times and the bad and see where this goes. It's really exciting. I only regret not doing more of that research earlier and getting more when it was around $3k.

No baby hands now, we need strong hands!

It’s a good idea to have some kind of savings. Too much savings is not a good idea since that money can start to be spent elsewhere. Having some kind of reserve for an emergency is not a bad idea.

Im in the same boat as the other guy. I thought "Eh I'll get in on the next drop" but now I'm interested. Just curious what makes you guys think next drop won't go below 10K?
