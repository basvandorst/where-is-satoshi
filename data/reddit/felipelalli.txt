The Bitcoin is unprecedented in Computer Science. In p2p e-cash engineering a hard-fork is always a BAD thing and should be avoided as much as possible (*but agreed that no more than possible*). Money is trust, tradition. Without confidence and stability in the functioning is not money. A hard-fork creates an entire new currency (derived from the original) and it can cause great pain and gnashing of teeth. This scenario would be your dream. Only for you.

This happened because most of transactions is using the minimum fee. If you guys also used the minimum fee to make the stress test, adding a little more to the minimum fee already would guarantee a 1 block confirmation time even in this scenario. Stop to spread lies!

@_date: 2014-03-12 01:48:17
I made a quick analysis getting some random stuck transactions and I think it is a kind of flood of a bet site using unconfirmed input to make transactions. If the input have some malformed transaction (with low fee, e.g.) it stuck all the subsequent transactions in the transactions chain. Anyone has a better explanation?
@_date: 2014-02-11 05:31:48
I'll use the highest volume automatically any day. For now I set up the priority order by volume manually updating the app. In this last version I also changed from BTC to mBTC by default (but you can change to BTC again if you want).
MtGox had brain-dead yet, but I still hope I could recover my 5 BTC frozen there. After they can close the doors forever. They just can't do what they did. They were disrespectful with their customers, with the entire Bitcoin community and with themselves. What is happening is totally surreal.

@_date: 2014-03-12 01:58:56
Yes. One day I made a test with low fee to see what happens and it makes my money frozen for a long time (I remember it took hours to back to normal) because the transaction sent for example 0.1 BTC to another address and send back to my input address the rest. So when I tried to spend in another place the transaction wasn't confirmed because I messed up with my no spent inputs.

You guys can't let your hashrate more than  35% of total network or you guys are killing yourselves. Everyone will assume (with reason) you are evil and in long term you are dead on market.

1. education (only enough to eliminate the "it is a scam!" / "it is a ponzi!")
2. make it easy to use (interface, so I agree with Andreas in this point)
3. strong believers. Use it for savings, the long term holders. We need a lot of them. (this is related with price stability that Andreas said)

Extending the idea, I could say if Bitcoin were New York City area, the price by m² would be aprox. US$ 2,92 (w/ Bitcoin price US$ 500,00).

Ainda que extremamente improvável que Dorian seja Satoshi, um erro grotesco que essa análise faz é subestimar Satoshi a ponto de não entender que ele poderia muito bem fingir um outro estilo de escrita para manter sua anonimidade.

I was thinking about it... Here we pay 5% to the exchange (including in/out fiat) and... where is this better than Western Union IF people want to have fiat? Bitcoin is not good to transfer fiat &lt;-&gt; fiat yet. But people should trust more in Bitcoin and store it, then it becomes really MUCH more cheap.

Third time to try and found terrible yet. I have two questions:
1. Where can I find a list of markets? I can see only two: Bizarre Co. Seed [US]  and seed.openlabs.co, why? Where can I find more? Inside Open Bazaar or on the Internet? If on the Internet, where exactly?
2. When I click in Bizarre Co. Seed, e. g., it shows a "Loading merchant..." forever. Reading something on Google I found out something is wrong with UPnP configuration. In my log:
➜  OpenBazaar git:(master) Checking NAT Status...

The problem is the people don't think in terms of millibits or even Satoshis. There is a psychological factor that makes people to want to buy an entire Bitcoin. That's why Dogecoin is popular now. This is a big boolshit, we have to talk in terms of millibits or Satoshis.

Thank you! I understand that the seed is safe, and even Trezor fails completely (the device) I still have a paper backup to use in another Trezor (if I understood well). But what about the tree indexes? The seed is nothing if you can't find "where" the coins are stored. Where the indexes are saved? In device? In browser client side? In server? It is totally unclear to me. One day my balance was ZERO and I suffer a lot to recover everything, following a lot of step-by-step and... in panic (even knowing my coins were safe). And I am a heavy user, what if it happens with my mother?

If (big IF) Dorian is the real Satoshi it is obvious for me that he would try to write different than he actually writes. It's easy to recognize someone with its style, for example my terrible English. There are software out there that can do that accurately. So, for me it's obvious he tries to hide its written style. I'm not saying he's the Nakamoto, I personally want to believe but I don't.

It remembers me web 2.0. I can understand the business marketing behind it but I think it is not time yet. We're fighting against regulation problems in basically all countries in the world. The State is trying to regulate a protocol. 60% of UK citizens think bitcoin is a fraud and we're talking about 2.0? It's hard to normal people understand the digital scarcity, how would they will understand concepts like multi signature or smart property? Let's make a step back.

I read the entire thread. I like Lukejr, but he is crazy now, I just can't believe he did it, totally anti-ethical in many aspects, beginning of the fact he is using his power on Gentoo to apply a non sense patch. 
The SatoshiDice business model is perfect! It's easy to use and very popular. So, now lukejr is saying that no body can do as SatoshiDice did? Is that true? Where is this rule? In "bitcoin manual"? I did not find any official documentation against this kind of business model. Anyone should be free to use the protocol as they want without be labeled as "DDoS attacker". In fact are the people "attacking", not the business itself. 
The protocol should be changed to avoid attacks if is the real case, but not with a blacklist. Blacklist should stay away from bitcoin or bitcoin is worthless.

That's my point. I think uBTC is a kind of envy of Dogecoin. It's hard to say 1 uBTC is 0.001 USD (less than one cent, so it's hard to fit in brain).

Jump from about 33% (1/3) to 50% (1/2) isn't so easy. It's just an approximation. But I'd put a 20% limit if I ran a mining pool, increasing my fees to avoid take too much share as BTCGuild did.

Example: "counterfeited/copied" it is possible to create artificial gold, but it spends too much energy. Also, it is possible to counterfeit fiat, it is just really expensive.
"Easy to verify authenticity" it is more for the average joe. How an average joe can recognize if something is fake or not? Gold is hard, he should bring it to a specialist. Bitcoin is easy, just to use a software that can verify. Fiat is more or less, you have to use some special pen or light.

This is what I am trying to saying a long time and the people downvote me like hell (maybe because my English is funny). Not only this, but Bitcoin should be considered as "digital gold", the people should trust it first, see the value of it, and then adopt it, and the natural demand will force the merchants to accept it. Many business stop to accept bitcoin (I know a lot of cases) because there is no sufficient demand. If people understand the value of Bitcoin everything else will be so natural.

I disagree with that. I am convinced now that Bitcoin should work near the limit size. Increase the block size will bring spammers to the network and a lot of more resources will be needed to process everything making bitcoin useless and pushing the price even lower.

@_date: 2015-05-26 23:44:20
1) The group has a lot of people because it was attracted by the people of MMN (ponzi schemes) thinking they could use Bitcoin to something. After the moderator started to ban every related MMN stuff, they stop to talk and the group stopped to increase so fast.
2) More exchange is better: more security, low prices etc. the only possible "problem" could be the "decentralized volume". But it is softened by good arbitrage. But, to speak frankly, only 2 or 3 exchanges has 95% of market share. One of them has bad history and the other has software bugs. So, we don't have enough exchanges after all.
3) About the Brazilian Bitcoin foundation, you said "They are secret cuz they are not public", are you serious? And it is their option to not be affiliated to the "main" foundation. Did you know the  even are not recognized by everyone? Have a look on 
4) I don't like ads there as well, but you have other options and other groups. Feel free to change.
5) Facebook is for silly discussions in general. But some discussions there are pretty good.
6) Deal with it.
7) So what? It is increasing.
8) Just don't use their service and try to help the community if you really think they are fraudsters. It has no relation with the title of the topic.
9) More community, better decentralization. The more active community on Facebook has 90% of the activity. Pick your community. About the sub reddits, one of them was totally abandoned for more than 6 months and now there are two, but the kind of posts are different. The is the best! :)
10) I don't see it.

@_date: 2015-05-06 02:44:03
I didn't forget it. But my guess (and it is just a guess anyway) is that the current max size *do influence* the final size. Why? Because when the max is too far away, the question will be "why not put it inside blockchain?" - the "it" thing can be just a spam or useless thing. Instead ask "it does not need to be inside the blockchain" we'll say "why not?". It is impossible to fully understand what goes on in each individual acting in the system. I think the blockchain will be increased eventually, but I think it is important to "not lose sight of the max size". If have a maximum size close to the actual use did not matter, it would not have even been created or contemplated in first place. It was to keep abuse away, and my guess is if we relax the size we'll invite the abusers. So, for me, changing the max too far away will influence to increase the actual use.

When Trezor will be really really smooth to the end user? I suffered a few scares when I see my balance disappear, to loose the tree index, to restart etc. I do not feel 100% safe now, I do not put all my money on it, do not look so smooth or robust. Trezor for me now is like a crooked window, it opens and closes, but...

You can have the concept of ownership with Bitcoin (with services like  e.g.) or decentralized authorities. The nature of a central government is violence, i.e., steal your property, totally against the concept of ownership.

The default wallet is still a full node, and Armory, what I use, is totally based on the bitcoin core. It is already little heavy. Take some time to validate the blocks, I spend CPU, memory, bandwidth, disk etc. Armory take some time to sync and index the blocks. When I let it down, when I turn it up it takes some minutes of heavy processing to index everything. It will get much worse after the blockchain relaxation.
Well, I guess it won't be possible to me run a node in my personal computer (I live in Brazil where everything is expensive and we are very late). That is (was?) the beauty of Bitcoin for me: anyone can run a full part of the network at home, in the default wallet! It won't be possible, it will turn the computer slow, the network crap, and even the wallet will be slower. Every node will move to VPS and the decentralization... good bye! This is what is happening with this blockchain relaxation: 
I think in this article he convinced me even more that it can be done so soon like that. 170GB / mo? WTF? I can't afford it.

Days ago I have opened a post criticizing Trezor. Why? Because I don't like to open my wallet and see I have "zero" balance. It is frightening. This can really scare normal people. Not me actually, because I know my bitcoins are safe. But, Trezor was made to lay people, wasn't it?
I also don't like the "anti-it", "anti-that" philosophy, I agree with you most posts are simply destructive, not constructive. But we must point out the problems and press for them to be fixed.

Gavin is right to try to convince everyone - this is the least. Otherwise the changes can imply in a bad fork and two coins in the market causing a sort of (big? little?) chaos. Keep making the analysis, tests, and the effort required to make the change. I believe that Bitcoin should run at its limit, I fear the increase of the block. I would like to be better convinced and see alternatives that have not seen any very concrete yet.
@_date: 2015-01-03 12:41:50
Wow, you just implement my idea. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 12:56:30
Nice to hear that! Thank you.
But what if my connection had shortcomings? Sometimes I use a really unstable connection, it could pass a bad impression to the end user (lack of a suitable error message, e.g.)? Or what if my USB cable has a problem?
I did not imagine that the site was so server-dependent, I found that many things were done client side. Probably I was wrong.
@_date: 2015-01-11 12:46:07
But in my case it was "loading forever" showing zero balance. It doesn't seems reasonable. A simple test would point that out. Have you guys tried some service like  ? Or even something like  ? Simple issues like that makes huge difference to final user.
@_date: 2015-05-08 05:25:58

I don't know, and for you? 20mb is good for you? Sometimes I think Gavin just kicked high to 20mb to play a kind of `argumentum ad temperantiam` and then suddenly everyone will be looking for a middle ground like 8mb? 10mb? 16mb? If he really wants the target to be 20mb, he would kick something like 60 or 80mb.
A nice thing to do would try to find out which transactions are "legitimate transactions". Excluding the spams, faucets, very low fees transactions, nanopayment, SatoshiDice, internal wallet movements etc. If the "abusive use" (and not the "normal use") represents like &gt; 50% of the network, so 1mb is fine for now. Let the abusive players pay a little to embark in the blocktrain.

What if any fake USB device which spreads malware is given? Use Linux or a good antivirus. An USB device can even toast your USB reader. The v2 won't solve all issues. What I image for future versions:
- NFC or something more secure than USB.
- Flexible device with a printed circuit.
- A sensor that shows the degradation of the device (to someone knows when it have to be replaced).
- A [kind of display]( (or even leds / lights) that shows the last balance.

Even if the above story were true, Andresen should tell the truth and say that he tried to be convinced by CW without the keys. The problem is that he could be threatened or the conviction was in the form of money. Hard to know the whole truth behind, but this is better than Mexican soap opera.

All store of value means are competing with each other. You always give preference to one over another. It is impossible to keep all of your wealth in all assets at the same time. You can put your wealth half in each one, but it is still giving preference over other types such as gold or the dollar.

Even my notebook does not show anything when I plug it in (different than before). The only different thing I did was: I tried to use it on Electrum wallet. I select: File -&gt; New / Restore -&gt; Restore a wallet or import keys -&gt; hardware wallet -&gt; use a device you already set up -&gt; TREZOR wallet.
Then I got an error saying a library was missing. So I installed "python-trezor" package and then trying the same path again I received a "your Trezor is not plugged".
After this, I tried to use in my mobile, MyTrezor.com and it stopped to work.

Hi little etherbug. I really don't care about ETH and really, I'll never ever invest a cent in ETH because I am not masochist. Unfortunately your romantic point of view is not consistent with the reality. I don't believe BTC will benefit from ETH; ETH made a big mistake in the beginning when Vitalik has chosen to use a brand new token instead the already consolidated Bitcoin. This causes rupture in the community, despite the romantic appeal and lies of etherbugs. Of course he was thinking about his pocket as well, he is not silly, but for me it is unforgiven. Big mistakes like that are unforgiven. He only thinks in his pocket.
I agree with you that both will still increase a lot in marketcap in comparison with dollar or other fiat money, much more and 7B and .8B, but it don't nullifies the fact that BTC and ETH are competitor among them. What matters is how % ETH represents in relation of BTC. [Today is 8.83%]( what is too much in my opinion, but still healthy. This matter yes, contrary to what you say, because it defines what is the appropriate investment today. We hodlers in the long term should invest in the right thing, otherwise we would be wasting wealth. More investments = more security. A cheap token is useless for decentralization.

WHAT IF
Dr. Craig Wright is really Satoshi Nakamoto and:
- He really lost his keys;
- He wants to clear his image of scammer;
- He convinced Matonis and Andresen that he is Satoshi just talking and answering very convincing questions;
- He convinced Matonis and Andresen to lie about the story of the keys.
It would explain:
- Why he didn't publish an open proof and instead a weird blog post;
- Why Andresen is so convinced but at the same time is saying he is not 100% certain;
- The English accent of Satoshi Nakamoto. :)
OK, it's a joke, but it's fun to think about all possibilities.

what if you use a TRNG to peek 16 words (from a big dic) to build the brainwallet with your email as salt in WarpWallet? And write down 15 words in a paper and memorize just one, shared with some family members. Is that still bad for you?

@_date: 2016-07-01 02:14:04
Cool! You are lucky. When Trezor works, it works great. I loved the PIN on screen, instead the security card of Ledger. Actually, the worst thing in Ledger is this damn card, you're right about that.
But, unfortunately Trezor didn't work fine to me.
@_date: 2016-07-01 00:59:15
Exactly. My first impression with the device was bad: it seems cheap, buttons without a "click" sound. Then, the website mytrezor was horrible. One day they just show "0.0 BTC" as balance and I freaked out. After that, to be honest I was using it with Mycelium without problem and it was good so far. I could even put a custom wallpaper in device, it was awesome! But after some weeks using it, the device just stopped to be recognized by *any* device. I changed the cable and tried everything, but it simply doesn't work anymore. I kept as museum and bought a Ledger Unppluged and found it *amazing*!

The full email:
&lt;&lt; Hello,
after one year of serving the bitcoin community we are now stopping sales of Woodwallets.io. We wanted to personally take some time to thank you for being part of this adventure as an early adopter. Here is our message :
TL DR; Life got in the way and  we will not able to work on Woodwallets.io with the same level of passion and dedication we used to. Instead of just running it like a boring online shop, we decided to suspend operations. If you happen to know someone who can be interested in picking up the business and run it with passion, get in touch.
Help up by sharing the announcement link :
It all started just for fun one year ago, with a reddit post titled “I have a lasercutter in my hands for a couple of months. Would you be interested in wooden paper wallets?” . The response was overwhelming.
After a month of prototyping and setups, I sneaked into the World Mobile Congress to personally hand the first wallet to Jon Matonis, then president of the Bitcoin Foundation. And here were are, one year and several hundreds Woodwallets later, facing a hard decision.
During Woodwallets‘s first and only year we have transformed a no-budget bizarre idea into a profitable business with a very solid reputation in the crypto-currency space. We always refused to get a “paid review of your product” in the bitcoin press – and I assure there was no shortage of “special offers” in our inbox. Yet we have been able to reach the bitcoin community at large, building trustful relations with our loyal customers. I still get surprised when I show the product at local events/meetups to find out that a decent number of  people already knows it.
By putting energy and dedication in delivering a product for bitcoiners, we have been able to focus on what really matter : making the community happy with the product. The feedback we received from Woodwallets buyers can attest that we hit the target.
Beside  being a an elegant piece of design, Woodwallets also helped in raising awareness about cryptocurrency in general and cold storage practices. A good ice-breaker for face2face introduction to cryptos, it also allowed for the creation of open source BIP38 encryption tools like bippy, pushing a bit over the boundary of bitcoin security and infrastructure.
However, it is now time for us to move on. Life sometimes gets in the way, and we  realized we won’t have enough time for running Woodwallets with the same level of dedication that brought us where we are now. We can’t afford anymore to spend nights soldering thousands of free bitcoin keychain rings for a conference by hand. We won’t be able anymore to experiment with new materials, research into new products, play with multisig, be active on social networks, promptly respond to emails and follow the altcoin scene while keeping keep up with this extremely fast-paced space.
Not being able to invest time in such activities will make Woodwallets just an ordinary, average and boring business. And we do not want to upset the (almost) one thousand amazing twitter followers and fans. Instead, we took the decision to stop taking new orders, with immediate effect.
We would be more than happy to leave everything we built so far in the hands of a company or an individual who is capable of running it with the same level of passion -possibly even more – that we kept during this year. If you think you are that person, or you know someone who might be the one, please get in touch or help us by spreading this message
And no, we will not conclude this message with a Bitcoin address begging for donations. Never did. Just two simple words, in the name of all the people who at some point collaborated in this project : thank you.
Whatever happens now, we will keep a good memory :)
Sincerely, 
Nico &amp; Rebecca &gt;&gt;

@_date: 2016-07-20 04:03:08
First, you don't know me to know if I am an expert or not. And you also don't know how I will use it.
Having said that, your advice is still good for the very newbie, yes. For who doesn't have a clue about what they are doing. But I generally don't like misinformation like "don't use that just because". I prefer: "use it only if you know what are you doing".

@_date: 2016-07-20 04:34:37
Exactly. And using a long invented phrase like this one can mitigate the low entropy:
    John uses a blue T-shirt flying in the sideral space with a green dog. He was born in 1980 and he also likes candy with a lot of hot sugar. He have lucid dreams every night and... you know the end of the story. Everyone dies. *-* jp23492 GPG ID 39842973
Security is about measuring risks. I'd say the best way to generate a wallet is playing physical dice, [preferably balanced]( Then, using a [TRNG]( And then a fair PRNG.
Store in the brain - only - (without a mixed of paper wallet or file) is really hard, because if you can memorize probably it is a bad phrase and if you can't you will loose your money.

I will use the WarpWallet just to hash a password like this, is it good enough for you?
    g
Generated with a TRNG TL-100. Plus 5 memorized words shared with some family members. So you ask: why not a simple SHA-256? Just because Scrypt is a *little* better hash. I am not crazy to store money in my brain - like I said before: if you can memorize probably it is a bad phrase and if you can't you will loose your money.

Completely wrong and overflowing with fallacies. All things (including gold, dollar, wood, metal, etc.) has a current value. If you believe Bitcoin, use it as you wish. Save it as savings, or buy anything with it. Sooner or later we will have to spend. Spend with Bitcoin is much cheaper and practical. Not because its price can (but not necessarily will) appreciate is that we should not use it. One day you'll have to meet your needs. Instead of dollar use Bitcoin.
