You're welcome to think whatever you want. I really don't care. I obviously want my bitcoin back from bitfinex so wanting them to succeed is "Shilling" ? In this case the entire community should want bitfinex to succeed and pay everyone back. So if you put it that way i guess everyone is a shill.
@_date: 2016-08-26 04:01:50
Well it sounds like you're able to withdraw your USD out through Synapsepay without a haircut whenever you want just like other verified US users. 
So your choices are: 
Either to wait until BFX is ready to unfreeze your account so that you can use their exchange, or withdraw the USD back to your bank. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 08:21:52
EVERY VERIFIED US USER HAS A SYNAPSE PAY ACCOUNT. Have you read any reddit threads regarding this topic before? Or anything zane tackett has said regarding this matter? Or do you just say anything and everything to try and make your twisted fantasy of bitfinex going bankrupt come true?

Not only are they around, but they are STILL the  USD exchange. And growing more every day. There simply is no better exchange than Bitfinex for your average user. Nobody wants to use an ugly exchange like Kraken or Bitmex, and as long as Bitfinex pays their users back in full, and continue to use cold storage from now on which they claim to be doing, then I see no reason not to use them. Call people foolish if you want, but when Bitfinex recovers completely and the bfx coins i bought are worth 3X the current value, we'll see who's feeling like a fool.
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:54:56

@_date: 2016-08-08 23:46:55
You know what else they are LEGALLY REQUIRED to do? Treat every customer equal and not push the entire loss to a small portion of their customers. That is highly illegal. So i'm not sure what you are suggesting here but go ahead and pick your poison. In the end lets just all hope we get at least 64% of our funds back. That is all.
@_date: 2016-08-14 03:49:58
OR maybe you all just have PTSD from MT GOX...with good reason of course. But that doesn't mean that Bitfinex is incapable of bouncing back from this. They can and they will! its 2016 people. We are progressing and that's a good sign for bitcoin overall.

And I would love to hear which exchanges you think are better. Bitfinex definitely had its issues, but it was the best exchange overall. And will continue to be (once the users are paid back)
The other exchanges are simply mediocre in comparison. Simple as that.

"Once these accounts get frozen it will be game over. It takes only 1 court injunction. Doesn't matter what smoke and mirrors they have created. They have an Achilles heel, and when it gets punctured they will die. "
This isn't going to happen. Here we are making some progress as a community one week later, and you are still here spewing BS about injunctions and bankruptcy. SMH. Anyone with common sense knows that's not a good idea. (see well-written post by erik vorhees on the matter) Only dummies are still suggesting this, and lucky for everyone else those dummies are too poor to do anything. Hence why you are here on reddit asking for someone else to do it rather than trying to get an injunction or whatever yourself. :-)

And you conveniently ignore the fact that Btc-e is offering trading with 0% fees for the next 2 weeks L O L. Obviously they are going to have an increase in volume.
After a hack it's normal for people to want to withdraw their money from an exchange. The same thing happened with Bitstamp...
 "Clearly the first several days of trading volume were fueled by traders exiting the exchange via BTC withdrawal."
Really? Is that why Bitfinex BTC price was trading below btc-e/bitstamp for the first 4-5 days after the hack? If what you are saying was true then we would've seen bitcoin on Bitfinex trading at a premium..which was not the case.
Your true colors are really starting to show now. Nothing you say adds up..you're just spewing nonsense. 
I am convinced you are now a representative from a shitty small exchange doing everything in your power to bash Bitfinex in hopes of expanding your user base.

You do realize One Coin isn't listed on any alt coin sites like coinmarketcap.com right? So not only is there no market, but if you buy into their scam and talk badly about it, they take your coins away too. Sounds like some innovative technology emerging! /s

you act like 29 cents is bad. It's only been 2 days. You will be hiding under a rock once Bitfinex announces their new investors and immediate repayment in full to their users.

"Shilling" ? What are you even on about. Bitfinex is a company and I want to see it succeed. Its in everyone who is involved in the bitcoin community's interest to do so as well. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:42:12
If they are going to pay back in full, (64% given, 36% to go) then I see no reason to not trade there again once everybody has been paid back? Other exchanges have been hacked before. As long as they pay their users back it is ok imo. Shit happens.
@_date: 2016-08-13 02:19:12
You are an idiot. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 00:01:04
There. I changed it to "scam" to make you happy. Even though it was not necessary.
Bitcoin was always able to be traded and if you own your private keys, you own your own coins and nobody can take them from you. One Coin admins have control over everyone's account and can close them down whenever they want if you do something they don't like. This was never the case with bitcoin, nor will it ever be. So you really shouldn't be comparing the two.
@_date: 2016-08-14 05:33:46
The funny thing about that is, all the people talking about class action lawsuits and suing can't afford any of that. And the people with big money are not retarded and know the 64% haircut and bfx coin route is the most efficient way to get 100% of the funds back. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 06:36:35
hi I have a question. 
For those of us that had locked withdrawal addresses, will those still be intact when withdrawals are re-enabled?
Also, can you please give us an approx date as to when we can expect to see withdrawals (and trading, but more importantly withdrawals) enabled? For example are you guys shooting for in the next 24 hours? or maybe within the next 48? Something please...I am asking because some people are speculating that relaunching the read only site is just for the BFX team to buy time and never plan to enable withdrawals. And the longer it takes the more people will say these things. While I don't believe any of that, I am really tired of reading these speculations. It is quite exhausting.  
Thank you. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:24:53
This comparison really cracks me up. BITFINEX IS NOT MT GOX OR ANYTHING CLOSE TO IT. 
I understand if you still suffer from mt gox PTSD, but these two situations are EXTREMELY different. So stop comparing them.
Mt Gox didn't give shit back. Bitfinex let its users withdraw 64% of their balances.

@_date: 2016-08-21 21:32:31
I believe ItBit is mostly OTC first of all, so they should have higher volume. Also if you look at the volume of Btc-e or bitstamp for example, Bitfinex really isn't doing too bad in comparison. But I agree it is definitely dead compared to what it used to be pre-hack. Hopefully they announce that they have found some investors soon and start to pay people back :) 
@_date: 2016-08-16 02:24:35
No, your hope is to try and shake the (slowly) growing confidence in Bitfinex. The USD/BTC amounts lent out are growing daily and will most likely continue to do so. So fuck off with trying to start shit. I'm sure Bitfinex will come out with another statement soon.  
Bitfinex will recover. They would not have allowed users to withdraw 64% of their funds if they weren't confident in recovering. Remember that.

@_date: 2016-08-17 05:35:31
If bitfinex thought there was even a small chance of them going bankrupt, they would not have opened the site back up and let people withdraw 64% of their funds. They would have just given up. I think there is a really good risk/reward ratio here, but to each his own. I'm not recommending anyone purchase BFX tokens, it's still definitely smarter and safer to keep all your $ in btc. But to say BFX is not a good risk/reward ratio is simply not true. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 02:42:04
Don't listen to these people. It is very clear that a small % of people want nothing other than to watch bitfinex burn. Even if it means nobody gets paid back. Which is sad, but what can you do :|. I just continue to downvote them. 
That or they are just outright retarded.
@_date: 2016-08-17 06:04:41
They are going to pay everyone back. Nobody cares to read your week old rants. They are honestly exhausting.

You were probably one of the people saying bitfinex wasn't going to pay anything back. Well guess what, they did. And they will also pay the users back in full. Go ahead and dump your bfx tokens for 20-30 cents, ill be more than happy to scoop them up. (oh wait you probably had no money on bitfinex and just enjoy trolling people that did)

@_date: 2016-08-15 04:11:03
That is what everyone should be doing imo. It's better for bitcoin as a whole if Bitfinex is able to recover from this. 
However there will always be those that want nothing more than to watch the world burn unfortunately. Either way I am confident Bitfinex will recover :) 
@_date: 2016-08-12 02:37:24
Seriously. These people on this reddit are overreacting way too much. The funny part is i'm willing to bet money that bitfinex will bounce back stronger than ever at some point in the future (once they pay their users back in full). They have the most user-friendly trading platform and dont require much kyc if any at all. And yes I have put my money where my mouth is, currently holding over 100k BFX tokens.
@_date: 2016-08-11 20:22:27

@_date: 2016-08-16 16:43:37
Bitfinex is still the  USD exchange and is nothing like MtGox.  Stop trying to compare the two. MtGox gave NOTHING back. There is a huge difference.
 To me it sounds like you are a rep from some small shitty exchange like Kraken or Bitmex that is trying to take advantage of this catastrophe in hopes of expanding your user base. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 05:30:59
"(This guy has outed himself time and again for being a BFX shill with obvious ties to the company.)"
Or maybe im just a regular Bitfinex customer that wants the rest of my money just like everybody else? It's in everyone in the community's best interest to want Bitfinex to succeed...for the sake of bitcoins trust more than anything.
HOWEVER you are nothing but a FUD spreader. Funny you think i have "ties to the company" because i'm pretty sure you are a representative from a small crappy exchange like kraken or bitmex, using this catasrophe as an opportunity to try and grow your tiny user base. Thats my observation based on your past comments. Nothing but shit talking bitfinex and suggesting law suits and bankruptcy. Any normal Bitcoiner would much rather BFX pay back in full rather than go bankrupt. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 21:50:34
What he said in this post is true. Funds ARE slowly going back into the exchange, you can tell because the number of lent USD is growing every day. And I am relieved to hear that they have switched back to cold storage method. They are back on the right track! The sooner they can pay everyone back the better..
@_date: 2016-08-16 23:34:49
Here you are again with the FUD posts. Hilarious.
No they will not shut down. Lent USD/BTC Swaps are GROWING by 100k-200k dollars every single day. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:31:23
I agree with you. The reality is, Bitfinex has the most user-friendly trading platform by far and many people now have nowhere else to go (Bitstamp/coinbase require excessive KYC, Bitmex/Kraken have confusing/ugly layouts, OKC doesn't accept US users...etc.)
I think many people will go back to Bitfinex (maybe not all, but most). However this will only happen if they pay their users back in full, and I don't think BFX staff is dumb so surely they know this. 
Lets see how things play out.
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:21:57
The people downvoting you arn't sockpuppet bitfinex accounts. They are your average reddit user downvoting you for being RETARDED. There have been some very good posts explaining in detail why the 36% haircut/bfx token route is much better than a lawsuit route written by Erik Vorhees etc. yet you people STILL cannot comprehend any of it. That's why you receive downvotes.
P.S. I was a casual reddit reader before the bitfinex hack, but felt I needed to express my opinions on this matter so I ended up making an account (hence the username)
@_date: 2016-08-16 16:33:25
exactly. Many people still like to use Bitfinex. And once everyone is paid back in full, even more will use it.

In case you weren't aware poloniex was in a similar situation a while back. They were hacked, and paid users back slowly via the profit they made from fees. Let's not be hypocrites now... 
@_date: 2016-08-16 06:37:09
You make it very clear that you will say anything and everything to break the growing confidence in Bitfinex, like I said which only further proves my point. You are even willing to put words in Bitfinex's mouth. For example...
"On top of it, they've made it clear that they don't understand how they were compromised -- otherwise they'd have done far more than simply rebuild their platform from the existing code. They are manually processing withdrawals because they know that automating the process exposes them to the same attack vector."
That is not true at all. They have said time and time again that they cannot discuss the breach YET, because they are still involved in an ongoing investigation. They also mentioned that they have made some changes to their platform. As far as manual withdrawals go, there is nothing wrong with that. Wouldn't you want all extra security precautions available to be utilized after something like this? I'm sure it's to show their users that they are doing their best to stay secure. And I bet you Bitstamp did the same thing after they got hacked last year. Either way, large withdrawals should always be done manually IMO. 
"I'm sure their plan was that this would instill confidence in the market. A long shot to think this would be enough to save their flailing, insolvent exchange."
Whether that was the plan or not is nothing more than speculation at this point. Confidence DOES seem to be growing (slowly as I mentioned) and your proof for that is that the number of USD/BTC lent out via swaps is rising on a daily basis. And finally as far as insolvency goes.... I personally disagree, but until more information on the hack &amp; bitfinex finances come to light, you are free to speculate as you please. (and attempt to cause chaos and fear which seems to be what you do best based on your comment history)
I suggest you put your money where your mouth is and short the BFX Coin if you are so certain Bitfinex is insolvent, as I have done. (I bought lots of BFX in my case) 
Good Luck ;)
@_date: 2016-08-11 05:43:12
I was also able to withdraw over 150 btc. Hope bitfinex can fully recover from this disaster. I would really like to keep trading at their exchange, but would only be willing to do so if/when I am repaid in full. And I'm sure many others feel the same way. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:56:34
"I'd recommend accepting Ethereum aswell. With BTC's slow transaction speed and high fees *at the moment* people won't want to pay a $14+ fee for $20 in drinks."
this is pretty far from the truth. bitcoin fees are cheap, and confirmation times are faster than usual *at the moment*. and will be even cheaper and instantaneous when lightning is properly tested and ready to be used by everyone. 
Also, not sure if you have ever paid with bitcoin before in person, (sounds like you haven't) but i don't know of any merchants (restaurants/bars etc.) that make you sit around and wait for a confirmation for $20 or less. 0 confirmation transactions are acceptable for this and it's been that way for years. The odds of somebody double spending you for $20 in person are super slim. 
and ethereum transactions can also be expensive at times. You are better off accepting litecoin rather than ethereum if you are really worried about high transaction fees/slow confirmation times.

Downtime: time during which a machine, especially a computer, is out of action or unavailable for use.
The amount of pending transactions is irrelevant in this case so idk why you are posting that. I have never waited longer than 1 block to get my transaction confirmed. You are given the option to pay a bit extra for priority. If that option was no longer available and the bitcoin blockchain came to a halt, that would be considered downtime.

Do you understand that bitcoin has been working NONSTOP without 1 day of downtime for the past 8+ years  and that maybe just MAYBE that has something to do with the reason bitcoin is so valuable? With each passing the day the likelihood that bitcoin will "fail" or "stop working" for some bizarre reason becomes less and less likely. There is no need for bailouts or having to trust third parties such as bank anymore. With bitcoin you are putting your trust in mathematics and thats it. It's very clear you don't know anything about bitcoin.
Do you understand what the term "antifragile" means? I don't think you do. How about you educate yourself on the topic of discussion (even just a little bit so you dont make yourself look like a total fool) before you go around calling other people sheep?

One thing you should always ask yourself before "diversifying" into shitcoins:
do i feel comfortable bagholding this shitcoin forever knowing there is a chance (and a good one at that) that it may go to 0, which means i will lose the initial bitcoin i invested into it? 
is your answer to this question no? then stick with bitcoin :) 
there's a reason bitcoin is  and will continue to be for the foreseeable future....it's proven itself over the past 8 years, and has been running nonstop, with no downtime whatsoever. 
I mess around with alt coins a bit too, but only with a very small percentage of my total btc, and only into a select few coins i would feel comfortable bagholding forever if need be.

(which it is imo, but if you know anything about bitcoin and believe it will succeed, you would know that the overall price trend is always UP long term). the funny part is that these are the people that will be buying bitcoin at astronomical prices, 50k+. because by then it will be considered "safe" etc. by mainstream media.

This is BS lol. You CAN pay $10,$20 if you'd like, but to send 1-50 btc transactions, you can still get priority with 50 cents to 1-2 dollars, and thats when the mempool has a huge backlog. Otherwise 20-30 cents will do just fine.
I have never had to pay more than like 1-2 dollars, even when there is 80k+ unconfirmed transactions.

Everyone in the know is converting their BTC to ETH... ETH is up 500% in last 30 days...
That's pretty funny. You must be new. And if you're not, then shame on you for trying to lure people in to buy eth at $50+ right now. ETH was up 500% + almost exactly 1 year ago, and again many people were saying the exact same thing as you.
I advise anyone reading this (especially those of you that are newer and have not been through this type of bubble before) to remember that 1 year ago when eth bubbled to +500% and the same maximum fud was being spread all over reddit, that bubble ended with the founder of eth, Vitalik Buterin, selling 25% of his total eth holdings for BITCOIN at the top of the rally.

I like eth and think it will succeed in the crypto space long term. Calling me a bitcoin maximalist because i'm trying to provide people who are panic-stricken and making dumb, emotional decisions with a reality check is not fair. And there's nothing wrong with hedging into eth, but when its up 500% is not a smart time to do it, and telling people things like "everyone in the know is converting BTC to ETH" is complete BS and you know it.
And actually yes, microsoft, and other banks have been supposedly using/testing eth since the last time it pumped last year. Ethereum Enterprise is just another fancy way of putting it to spark hype imo. But that is besides the point. The point is that eth is still too new to be the  crypto. It's not even 2 years old. It has not proven itself to be nearly as secure and bug-free as bitcoin has over the years. Do you really think eth would be able to sustain the 20b market cap bitcoin has right now *if* it managed to take the  spot? Remember what happened with the DAO? eth PLUMMETED hundreds of percent in like 1 hour because of a bug. And if you really think eth will never have a bug again i'm sorry to tell you that is very unlikely. 
I know you will try to argue that the DAO hack was not ethereum directly, it was the smart contracts fault. But the point is that eth itself has also had bugs and will continue to have bugs in the near future due to its complexity, and how much less secure it is, in comparison to bitcoin.

Sounds scary for sure....maximum fud is in the air no doubt. Personally I know better than to fall for it though and will continue to hodl, as difficult as it may be to do that in times like these. I agree with Andreas Antonopoulos in saying that I do not think the "dooms day hard fork" will happen.
In order for the massive alt pumps to work anymore people need to be so scared they will shit their pants and make emotional, panicky decisions.
How do you accomplish that? 
MAXIMUM fud....crash the btc price a bit..and people will buy into it. Same thing happened with the super eth pump last march only then it mike hearn rage quitting and writing blog posts about the halving day doomsday scenario (which never occured of course). Then when its all done, the mass fud subsides, people stop overreacting and realize bitcoin still works fine and focus on trying to progress rather than fight and shout at each other. The end result is the alt pumpers profit handsomely in btc amounts, while simultaneously weak hands are shaken out of btc, and then after some time the up trend continues. 
Maybe its just me thinking like this, but my gut tells me this is all connected. 
Things around the world are not getting any better and bitcoin will continue to thrive because of this imo. 
****and for anyone that says things like "well if bitcoin doesn't progress another coin will take it over very soon" I will call bullshit because the reality is that bitcoin works great, has had no detrimental glitches or bugs for years, and is way more secure than any other coin will be for a while.

these posts only come out when alts are getting pumped to the sky....never when they are getting dumped to oblivion. Wonder why! 
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:07:03
Ill tell you what I strongly believe is going on. Eth and Dash are coordinated pumps to begin with. Pumpers buy the bottoms, pump it up a bit, and then to unload all of their shitcoins at these high levels that nobody wants to buy at (obviously), they begin to dump the btc price and push maximum fud about block size and how alts will take over,which causes people who don't know any better to "diversify just in case" and those people then end up buying the shitcoins the pumpers bought in the .01 - .02 range for quadruple the price at .04 - .08 range. 
The end game? The pumpers end up with THOUSANDS more btc and THOUSANDS of people are left bag holding shit coins. Then btc continues its steady up trend and the maximum fud we have been witnessing the past week magically disappears. 
Saw the same thing happen with ETH pump last march, only then it was a combination of block size debate + halving day doomsday scenario FUD. It's the same thing every time
There is nothing wrong with diversifying obviously, but buying when an alt is +200-500% in 1-2 weeks is a stupid idea regardless of how much btc is dropping imo...If you want to diversify you should wait until things settle down, and not trade or make decisions based on emotions, which is what many people do, (and the whales/pumpers responsible for this know exactly that) 
I also believe there is a lot of new money coming into the crypto space, but that doesn't change the fact that these coins are being pumped up in the first place.

 bitcoin transaction fees in dollar amount increase when bitcoin price goes up. They always have and they always will (for first layer transactions). When bitcoin was $500 each the transaction fees in dollar amounts were close to nothing. When it rose to $2000 they were a bit more. Now at $4000 per coin they are also a bit more expensive than they were at $2000.. the solution to this is lightning network and we should have that soon hopefully now that we have segwit =)

Bitcoin allows you to transfer any amount of money across the world for a very small fee. Also if you wanted to move across the world to live your life somewhere else for whatever reason, with bitcoin you can easily do that at any given moment, with little to no headaches. If you wanted to transfer gold/silver etc you would have to jump through many hoops and pay many many fees  to transfer your wealth across the world. This is why I personally like bitcoin, and why people sometimes refer to it as a gold 2.0

Rosie what happens if i bought 10 bitcoins  for $500 each from coinbase, transferred them to my cold storage for a few weeks, and then later sold those same 10 bitcoins for a loss at approx $450 each? Isn't it common sense that that would result in a $50/coin loss (equaling $500)?

@_date: 2016-11-27 09:19:08
bitcoin is unlikely to sit in the $200 or even $300 range with only 12.5 coins being rewarded per block. If anything the low will be $400 or $500 in my opinion and this is because of the halving that occured this year. The market always tends to factor that in, just like we never saw $100/bitcoin again since the last 2 halvings happened. 
This is all assuming your idea was to play out of course.
@_date: 2016-11-02 20:40:48
the truth is any other crypto coin that tends to skyrocket from nothing to like 10 dollars etc, do so partially because of many people having the mentality of "don't want to miss the next bitcoin!" just like you. These coins ALL end up crashing in the end as people sell them to cash out their shitcoins into...more bitcoin.  
If you really believe in bitcoin, then you just need to admit you were wrong for overlooking it and not buying any when you first heard about it, and buy as much as you can afford to now rather than be stubborn. It's OK to not own a full bitcoin. That can be a goal to work towards if anything. Remember there are only 21 Million BTC, so having 1 is still a lot!

This isn't true. It could easily go to ATH within a few months. People will be wishing they bought at 880-900 then. The truth is nobody knows what will happen. You shouldn't be telling people the price is going to dip just because you think it will. I personally think it will go up more.
@_date: 2016-11-13 22:57:50
the "bitcoin buzz" you speak of died off in 2014..hence the down trend to those lows in the $200 range but that doesn't mean bitcoin is dying. Its actually quite the opposite. Bitcoin is stronger than ever and more and more people are beginning to use bitcoin every single day. If you fail see that then i advise you to look again.

your bank account costs you 30EUR a year to send money (roughly 250 transactions), some of those being international? I call BS unless you are sending like 50 cents. To send a few hundred dollars through bank transfer internationally costs $10 at minimum
I can still send $1000-100,000+ across the globe for under $1 so no, bitcoin is working just fine at this point in time.

No they really are not close minded words. Sounds more like common sense to me. Segwit has been tested for  1-2 YEARS now. Keep in mind that people are not just going to adopt some new proposal that has barely been tested for bugs/glitches and put the bitcoin protocol at risk like that. While something might go wrong when/if segwit is activated, it is a lot more unlikely than if we were to adopt some new proposal that has barely been tested like BU.
Edit: Segwit has been tested for approx. 1 year now, not 2. This is still plenty of time. Enough for many of us to be confident that nothing was overlooked.

@_date: 2016-11-15 16:48:11
Well I really hope they do orphan those blocks if that's what it takes. So sick of this bs. Anyone that cannot see that segwit is helping bitcoin as a whole needs to do some better research. It has also been tested for well over 1 year so I really doubt there is anything to worry about there. Even Andreas is supporting segwit now. What more do you need, people??  &gt;_&gt;
@_date: 2016-11-29 03:12:14
Agreed. Before I was on the fence about segwit, mostly because I didn't really understand it. Then recently I heard Andreas supporting it and briefly explaining it and now it's clear to me that segwit is what's best for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-18 09:41:21
There are people using it though. And a growing number at that. Just because you can't see it first hand does not mean it isn't happening :) I am lucky enough to be one of the people seeing it happen first hand however. I happen to know hundreds of people that use bitcoin daily to transact with other individuals.

lol no. you should be looking at the chinese exchanges. they are leading by $30-40 and have also made 3 year highs just today. Definitely going to test $800 and beyond. 
Fun fact: the only other times china has been ahead by 30-40 dollars or more was when we went from 250-500 in 2015, and from 470-780 this past summer. but if you think the price is going down from here then go ahead and open a short :P 
Good luck!

@_date: 2016-12-10 05:32:09
I'm not familiar with this site but unless they are scamming the entire bankroll, you have nothing to worry about. If you forgot your account information just contact support and they will help you recover your account. Explain the situation and give them the username of the account you were on, and they will most likely ask you to prove the sending address to that account is yours by signing a message using your address. 
This is what most dice sites do. (Has happened to me before in the past. Got my coins back no problem).
By doing this, you are proving to the site owners or whoever that you sent the btc to that account in the first place, which means the bitcoins clearly belong to you. 
**If however you sent the coins from a wallet that was not yours, (like an exchange for example) then there is a good chance you are SOL

The socialized losses were settled in USD terms. So Anyone who lost bitcoins and received bfx coins will eventually receive the USD equivilent to whatever btc were valued at at the time....~$600. That way if bitcoin rises, bitfinex will actually be making more $ from fees and will essentially be able to pay back the USD debt faster.

@_date: 2016-12-02 04:27:59
No it really doesn't make sense. If someone bought 10 bitcoins at $500 each, moved them out of coinbase for 2 weeks into cold storage, and then moved those 10 bitcoins back onto coinbase and panic sold them at a loss for $450 each, that would result in a $500 loss. The way Rosie explained things,  the loss would not be accounted for...so how would that person claim their loss on that $500?
*Maybe* what Rosie said would be okay if the person only had buying transaction history on coinbase and no selling transaction history (I still disagree with that but that's besides the point i'm trying to make here), but for someone who bought and sold an equal amount of bitcoin through coinbase in the same year it makes absolutely no sense to report an outgoing transaction as a sell order.
Since your expertise is in crypto accounting I would like to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks.

The more people I hear saying "bitcoin is not money. only gold and silver are money" etc, the more I realize how much more bitcoin can potentially grow. Because as time goes on, more and more of these people that hate btc and call it a ponzi scam end up becoming more open minded about it, doing research, and joining in. We've been seeing this for years, and it's not going to stop! go bitcoin.

Coinbase is the easiest for newcomers in my opinion. If support is being slow, make a reddit post and explain your problem with coinbase somewhere in the title. They are surprisingly good/quick to respond when it comes reddit posts. 
Another alternative is 
on localbitcoins you will be paying a small premium though. If you don't mind that then this site will work well for you. 
The above are the two sites I have used myself so those are the ones I will recommend. However I have also heard many good things about  
If you decide to use paxful let me know how your experience was as I am curious and may use it myself in the future :) 
Hope this helped!

when coinbase integrates segwit those transaction fees will drop significantly. some patience is needed, i assume it's currently in the works and should be integrated soon. the reason i say they are currently working on it is because in order to use 2nd layer solutions like lightning network, you must first integrate segwit. Coinbase has recently contributed $ to lightning network developments as you can see here:
so its safe to assume that coinbase is working on integrating segwit imo.

Craight Wright is absolutely NOT satoshi as he cannot provide any proof, there's no reason to say "he may or may not be". 
"In fact if I wanted to transfer from BTC to BCH it would cost me over $100 in fees so I'm sitting on the sidelines until I feel I can transact without having to pay ridiculous fees in the fee market Core wanted."
The fee market core wanted?...Right..I'm sure the temporarily high fees have nothing to do with the fact that over 50% of the unconfirmed transactions are spam and are paying less than 1 penny or not paying anything at all for a fee, and everything to do with "the fee market core wanted".
since you claim to be a rational person who makes decisions based on proof and not a shill :) :) - here you go.

these kinds of posters lead noobies into the slaughter house essentially. These noobies think they are buying bitcoin when in reality they are buying bch, a coin they think they will be able to spend but in reality they will not be able to spend it ANYWHERE. that is definitely NOT bitcoin.
bch is going to have 500k-1million coins released onto the market come january from coinbase/xapo....
 Do you understand what would happen to the bitcoin price if satoshi moved his coins? the price would plummet. so it's very obvious what will happen in january when all those coins are on the market. the people these posters are targetting have no idea about any of that. its simply not fair to them. This guy taking the posters down is doing the right thing.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:26:51

Fair enough, i don't know much about that so i can't say too much but what i do know is that the core developers are EXTREMELY cautious when it comes to planning upgrades for bitcoin, maybe even a little bit too cautious, but thats ok with me. better to be safe than sorry especially when billions of dollars are on the line. i trust their judgement and dont think they would release code that would put bitcoin + the community at risk like that if we were to adopt it. but thats just me.

Core is extra careful and likes to test things thoroughly before releasing it and deeming it safe. There is peoples' money on the line here for crying out loud, billions of dollars of peoples' money . Better to be safe than sorry. 
FYI core is not against hard forking to increase block size but if it was to happen their time frame is 6-12 months for thorough testing, not 2 months which is what segwit2x proposed.

let me remind you (or educate you incase you didn't know) that craig wright tried to fool the entire bitcoin community into believing  that he is satoshi nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin. He is also a well known con artist. So yes BCH is definitely a fake bitcoin run by a fake satoshi.

Lightning is a 2nd layer solution that will run on top of the bitcoin blockchain. No fork necessary. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:25:00
if you use segwit then blocks up to 1.7mb are possible. 
Also...bitcoin transaction fees in $ terms were always going to go up. This was known from the start, even when bitcoin was $200 or less. As the price of bitcoin continues to appreciate, so will the fees in dollar amounts. the satoshis per transaction fee are not really changing much, it's just that those satoshis are becoming more valuable in $ terms. Again this was always what bitcoin was intended to do!
The reason - when all 21m bitcoins are mined, miners incentive to continue securing the network will be coming solely from transaction fees. So the idea is that by that time, bitcoins will be worth so much that the transaction fees (in dollar amounts) will also be significantly higher and will compensate for the miners not receiving bitcoin from every block reward like they do now.
No i am not saying that 50-100k unconfirmed transaction backlogs are ok, but it is what it is for the time being and im simply trying to point out that the increase from 0.5-1 dollar fees to 2-3 dollar fees is not out of the ordinary. 
THE SOLUTION - Lightning network! Now that we have segwit, 2nd layer solutions like LN are now in the works and should be implemented definitely within the next year, hopefully within the next 6 months. If you don't know what lightning network is, please do some research as i have no time to explain. i am going to bed :) hope this helps

but can we all agree that paying $2 to send a transaction is not ok?
 
that $2 will be $3 when bitcoin goes to 12k...as the btc price rises, so does the transaction cost in dollar amounts. satoshi/kb remains unchanged on average. this was always the way it was going to be. lightning network is the solution.

Please be patient. Lightning network is the solution.

the people that have accumulated lots of bitcoin (lets call them the 1% of bitcoiners) took a HUGE risk early on and were rewarded handsomely because of that..with every passing day bitcoin is being viewed as less of an experiment as it  had originally began, and more of a decentralized store of value people can rely on.
the people that have accumulated the majority of the wealth in the current central banking system (the 1% of the current financial system) made their money by essentially stepping on the middle and lower class, and this is how they are able to stay rich and keep everyone else poor. 
Which do you prefer?

Hi there- 
"So not sure if I will be welcomed to the community as a noob posting on this thread but I gotta say what a hell of a jump! Congrats to you guys!"
thank you. it is really quite the milestone for bitcoin. And of course you are welcome here. We were all noobs at one point or another!
I can't tell you when a good time to buy is, but I will tell you about my bitcoin experience as a noob and hopefully you will be able to learn something from it.
I first heard about bitcoin in 2013 when it was around $100 and like most I ignored it, was skeptical, etc. After I heard it had spiked to $1300 in november 2013 I decided to set up my coinbase account and purchase 1 bitcoin. My first purchase took place on december 26 2013 for around $650 or so. Over the course of the next 2-3 months the bitcoin price began to rise up to $1000, and i ended up investing a significant amount of my savings into btc at around the $800-1000 price range. Throughout all of 2014 the bitcoin price continued to decline, slowly but surely..700,600,500,400,300,200... accompanied by literally hundreds of news articles stating that bitcoin is officially a failed experiment and will go to $0. I was pretty sad to say the least. But.. I continued to buy bitcoin every week during 2014, accumulating more slowly but surely, which helped to lower my average buy in price significantly. What kept me holding and not selling my coins during this depressing time was the fact that I had educated myself and understood the potential of this technology and knew that patience was required..Look at how many years the internet took to evolve into what it is today for example. It's important to understand what you are buying here! Do not buy btc simply for the sake of getting rich quick. take the time to do your research. It's worth it, trust me. 
If you really come to understand bitcoin you'll find that bitcoin is DESIGNED to continuously go up in the long term. If it does not appreciate over time then it WILL fail (im talking 5-10 years time, not annual insane growth like we have seen this year). Read up on the block halving to understand why if you are curious ..it comes down to simple supply and demand. 
Here is a youtube channel link to the best public speaker in the bitcoin community (imo). Andreas Antonopoulos helped me learn about bitcoin. bitcoin can be confusing but he is really great at helping noobs understand. He travels the world and educates people and various governments about bitcoin, and has been doing so for years now. My favorite is the video where he educates the canadian senate about bitcoin, though all his videos are good.
here you go, hope this post helps you out!

the mining situation in bitcoin cash is just as fraudulent as BCH itself and craig wright and you know it. When BCH isnt going parabolic and rising 50-100% a day there is usually 1 pool with more than 50% of the hash rate.

"now I'm back I'm being charged 10% for each transaction of btc wallet to wallet? "
this is not how transaction fees are calculated first of all.
difficulty adjustment should be within a week, things should run a bit more smoothly then.
you should consider upgrading to a segwit wallet. i did and have been paying 1-2 dollars for top priority confirmations for months. (excluding this past week)

based on your comment history its very clear that you are a bcash shill so i'm not going to waste my time replying after this.
I will say shame on you for trying to sucker people into buying bcash when you know damn well that in january when coinbase + xapo release close to 1 million BCH the price will collapse and anyone that fell for your shilling will be looking at a tremendous loss on their investment.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:41:29
while this may be true its important to keep in mind that over 50% of the those currently unconfirmed transactions are paying NO FEE AT ALL - 0 sat/kb = no fee, and 5 sat/kb is less than 1 penny fee.

You say you realize that this the way it has to be, but apparently you don't otherwise you wouldn't be complaining in the first place.
So I will say this. You need to realize that the excess information coinbase asks for is not bitcoins fault, it is the banking institutions etc. that ask for all of this and coinbase has no choice but to comply with regulations.
And yes the inconvenience you described here will get better because as we have seen over the years, more and more people are getting into bitcoin and the more people there are that are able to transact with one another using bitcoin alone, without the need for third parties, (as it was intended) the easier it will be. Give it time. 
Another option is using a bitcoin ATM as someone has mentioned.

ikr...coinbase has never been the best at customer service, and it's nothing new for them to be closing peoples accounts. They are picky where you send your funds. If you send them to a casino or DNM or something like that, your account will most likely be closed. It happens to many people.
Other than that, their site works just fine. FUD indeed.

I still think SW Will activate on LTC. No need to panic...It's still very close and other pools can get it to the 75% threshold. 75% is a lot different from bitcoins 95% threshold.
@_date: 2017-04-05 21:06:55
People like Vinny Lingham told us to "vote with our feet" aka sell our bitcoins to show that we want segwit activated. I chose not to sell my bitcoin because I am a HODLer, and decided instead to diversify a portion of my btc into LTC rather than any other alt, to show my support for seg wit. AKA another way to "vote with my feet" without having to sell my btc :) 
@_date: 2017-04-09 05:03:37
No problem. google "KYC/AML" aka Know Your Customer/Anti Money Laundering laws
Because of the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin, the IRS requires heavy compliance of KYC/AML from bitcoin exchanges like coinbase.
"But once I have BTC in my possession, all tracking goes out the window, right? So how does it help that they know I bought them in the first place, if they don't know where I'm spending them?"
It may be difficult but you are still able to be tracked to an extent, if need be through Blockchain Analysis. 
 Apparently Blockchain Analysis is becoming more and more advanced as time goes on. Unfortunately I don't have a good article to link to you on this topic off the top of my head...sorry.

thank you for having original designs! Nothing against other people opening bitcoin apparel stores, but if you're going to do it.... don't just have shirts and hoodies with nothing but the standard bitcoin logo on it and then wonder why nobody is buying your apparel.
on a side note:
as a bitcoin fanatic and as someone that is very cautious about making myself a target (yes i know i may be paranoid), i would love some low key bitcoin apparel that *for the most part* only bitcoin enthusiasts would understand. If you could think up some cool designs that are low key like that and put them on some shirts, i would buy the shit out of them. These are definitely a step in the right direction. 
just my 2 cents :)
 really cool designs- keep up the good work!

Can I transfer my existing coins into Robinhood?
"At this time, we don’t allow transfers of your existing cryptocurrency assets into your Robinhood Crypto account. There are a few reasons for this, but our primary concern is to prevent money from illegal activity being used for transactions on Robinhood Crypto.
We’re currently building specific anti-money laundering measures on our platform in order to protect both our platform and our users. We’ll be sure to update you if and when this type of transfer becomes available."
source: 
IMO, in the future they will allow both deposits and withdrawals of crypto, but time will tell.  this is good news (at least for the price of bitcoin) as it will create more buy pressure than anything since you will not be able to deposit any btc to sell for the time being.

"I was rushing to buy at 19k 16k and recently 13,700 a few weeks ago , now that's it's crashed I see things totally different , I feel like I'm the mainstream sucker who got pumped at the high levels and now the bubble is bursting .."
if you sold on the lows now, you will most likely again be the sucker to buy once we hit new highs, whenever that may be.. I suggest you hold, and take this time while the hype is gone (for now) to understand what bitcoin is all about. Bitcoin is designed to continuously increase in value over time if it is going to succeed. 
I was there at one point. I started to buy bitcoin after i heard about it on some mainstream media when it had first hit $1000 in 2013. I bought at $900. Watched it crash all the way down to $200 over the next year and also felt like the sucker. I took that time to educate myself on BTC and it helped me restore my faith. You should restore your own faith in bitcoin by learning about what you bought...not by asking others to try and make you feel better about buying the local top, on reddit. :P just my 2 cents. Hope this helped!

Not many people are denying its a bubble at this point. That how bitcoin tends to grow, it goes through bubble phases with a long term upward trend as it is designed to do (if it will succeed). Since bitcoins existence it has always been extremely volatile and will continue to be volatile for some time because the past 7 or 8 years have been nothing but price discovery. Once/if bitcoin reaches $20-$100k+ per coin for example, the idea is that it will have passed through the price discovery mode by then and will have a large market cap which means the volatility will decrease significantly. At that point it will be more suitable as a currency.
Take a look at a long term gold chart if that doesn't make sense to you. They are not exactly the same but you will be able to see the similarities...gold was very volatile at the start, and as it got a larger market cap it became less volatile.

It is worying to read the many negative posts about poloniex. I have continued to withdraw my daily $2k from poloniex with no issues every day for months though so I cannot complain. 
I do hope they hire some more staff members and get their act together. To me it doesn't look like they are insolvent as many are speculating but more of a "too rich to care/too rich and are lazy" phase they are currently going through due to their explosive success this past year. I have seen it happen before to other companies + people I know personally, which is why I am going to assume this is the case with polo.

clearly you are the noob. if you weren't you would know that you dont have to buy a whole bitcoin. you can buy fractions of a bitcoin. also there ARE people willing to pay 4+ (and 6k+ by next year imo) to enter the market aka buy 1 whole bitcoin as you put it. and for those that aren't willing to pay that much are welcome to buy a fraction once again.

bitcoin has been around the longest by far and has definitely proven itself to be a robust, antifragile blockchain with no downtime whatsoever. all other coins are guilty until proven innocent, especially considering that majority of alts have only been a round for a couple of years with the exception of litecoin of course (Eth has only been around for 2 years etc.). Any/every other coin is very likely to be a victim of some sort of bug/flaw as more people start to use it and put pressure on said network. You simply cannot underestimate bitcoins anti fragility even if it may not seem like a valuable attribute to you. 
Also the only coin some corporations are throwing their weight behind is ethereum, and they want to use their own private fork of ethereum, not the actual eth blockchain. Same can be said for ripple.

I'm aware our currencies are no longer tied to gold. That's not what I meant. I was just trying to tell you to compare the volatility between the two as they are arguably similar assets and grew in a similar manner....the wild west of gold vs the wild west of crypto which we are currently going through, etc....Many people including myself would refer to bitcoin as a digital gold that you can divide/transact with easily for example.

Im willing to bet money that if the poll was done on twitter where many reliable polls take place (or something similar), then the results would be the same as every other btc vs bch poll thats been done in the past 10 months. 90%+ bitcoin, 10% or less bcash.

bitcoin is designed to increase in value over time, if it's going to work. maybe not as this crazy fast rate it has been this past year, but in general the trend will always be up in the long run. otherwise it will fail. do some research on the halving that occurs every 4 years.

Serious question...are you relatively new? This kind of stuff has been going on for YEARS...bitcoin is still chugging along just fine. The crypto cat is out of the bag, and governments are smart enough to know this will not be something they can just try to ignore or defame. 
Also Japan just started to accept BTC as legal tender throughout their country. Do you really think they will be the only ones to do so- and that others will not follow along and will instead go in the completely opposite direction?
Russia banned bitcoin for like 1 year, and guess what. they unbanned it and are now embracing it. banning cryptocurrency is a waste of time and energy.

"It's easy to say he's smart AFTER the fact. However, for someone to invest such as high amount ($10,000) at the age of 22, in such a risky market, it would actually be considered extremely stupid. You can't call someone smart because they gambled their money on Bitcoin and won. He was lucky, not smart."
It depends how you look at it. First of all, there is luck involved in everything. Second of all, in my opinion taking high risk high reward +EV risks when you are as young as OP is the right time to do such things. So no, he is not stupid at all.

the eth devs WANT eth to move to PoS, just like the bitcoin devs WANT bitcoin to adopt segwit. its not a GUARANTEE at this point like you are making it out to be. I love how so many people just think that the eth miners will give up their stellar profits from mining $100-200 eth tokens for 2 months+ now so easily and switch over from proof of work. There will most likely be a governance/fork problem in ethereum in the near future similar to what bitcoin is going through right now. and the faster ethereum grows, the faster everyone will realize it's just as vulnerable to these sorts of things as bitcoin...if we're going to call the scaling debate etc. a vulnerability that is. Imo they are growing pains and nothing more. Eth is not perfect either, sorry.
And a lead eth dev since the beginning of the project agrees with me.

Bitcoin has been around the longest and has proven itself over the past 8 years to being resilient and immune to any sort of hacks even with plenty of incentive for hackers to do so ($28-30b worth to be exact). It is far more secure than any other cryptocurrency. Naturally, people want to keep their money secure!
Network effect is also pretty huge as well, and the fact that now countries are starting to  legitimize bitcoin (such as Japan making bitcoin legal tender for example ) 
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:50:54

most other cryptocurrencies have risen 500-1000% over the past 2 months..whereas bitcoin has risen about 100%. So although is seems like the price is too high...Percentage wise, it really has not bubbled much yet in comparison to the alt coins. I would stay away from other coins at this time. But it's your money...so do whatever you think. Just do not invest more than you can afford to lose!

No this is not true. If you pay $1-$1.50 you can transfer your btc within 1 confirmation (which takes 20-30 minutes usually ).
If you dont want to pay the 1 dollar fee, then you can wait up to 24-48 hours yes.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:41:12
Cool story. Welcome back :)
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:53:15
The idea is that by that time, the price per bitcoin will be so high that there will be plenty of incentive for miners to continue securing the network from just the fees alone.
So while the rising fees in dollars may seem high to some people...that's how bitcoin was designed and it's supposed to happen that way in the long term as the price per bitcoin rises.
@_date: 2017-05-18 01:42:48
if you have an up to date wallet and are ok with paying 2-4 dollars in fees (atm since there is a huge backlog, usually it is cheaper), its not bad at all. I have never waited longer than 1 block for a confirmation and have never paid more than 4 dollars. And I send substantial amounts on occasion.

1) Do not even consider mining. Very inefficient unless you have millions of dollars to invest into a mining farm warehouse or free electricity. In most cases it is better off to just buy bitcoin instead.
2) you think bitcoin is in a bubble? Take a look at all of the alt coins...they are all up anywhere from 200%-1000% each over the past 2 months. If you want to buy some alt coins I would wait until they have a serious price correction which will absolutely happen at some point.
3 + 4) Bitcoin is the least risky crypto to invest in as it has been around for so long and proven itself. It will have its fluctuations, but overall the past 8 years of bitcoin have shown us the overall trend is up....just like bitcoin was designed to do over time. appreciate in value.
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:13:31

Seriously, gtfo with these BS, FUD assumptions. I withdraw 2k usd daily from polo every day with no issues whatsoever. I did just a few hours ago as a matter of fact. I'm also not the only one that is successfully withdrawing. 
You also have no idea what you are talking about in general, and your last statement ("By withdrawals I mean crypto withdrawals. I cannot imagine cash withdrawals working on Poloniex anyway..." ) certainly proves it. Poloniex has never accepted cash deposits or withdrawals, ever.
@_date: 2017-05-13 08:52:32
Damn dude you better sell your bitcoin then. But by the sound of it you are already all in on alt coins. Hope that works out well for ya.
"If Bitcoin fees continue to rise, and transaction backlogs continue to get longer, then there is a point in the future where it becomes less efficient than WU. There are two ways this can be avoided:
The community finds a way to end this stupid scaling debate (very unlikely)
More and more people stop using Bitcoin (already starting to happen)."
When? Do you have any idea how absurd the fees are and how  inconvenient WU actually is? It would be at least 10-20 years before anything like what you are saying even becomes a possibility. Very few people have stopped using bitcoin, and a scaling solution is very likely to be implemented and agreed upon before OPs doomsday scenario every played out.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:51:08
@_date: 2017-07-09 18:42:09
That depends on what you consider fast. The fees would be cheaper and faster than they are currently with larger blocks, but not super cheap and instant like they would be with lightning network. I don't mind bigger blocks, but I just think lightning network (instant transactions) is way more valuable. I am very confident that the price of litecoin will skyrocket once LN is implemented in the near future, as would the price of bitcoin if it were implemented there too. We can use that as a perfect example...

@_date: 2017-05-26 08:27:16
bitcoin has proven to work flawlessly under pressure for 8 years now..It's the most secure chain by far and that really should not be underestimated. Why would I want to put the majority of my crypto wealth in a less secure crypto than bitcoin? Bitcoin is the only crypto i trust to put the majority of my crypto holdings in because it's the only one that has proven itself to be reliable over the years.
Alt coins are guilty until proven innocent, as they have not proven themselves to operate flawlessly for extended periods of time under pressure/high traffic the way bitcoin has.

It won't have any effect on bitcoin imo. It will just make the litecoin price rise even more as bitcoiners show support for segwit, and hopefully the LTC price rise will eventually help BTC adopt segwit as well.
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:00:54
When people are being hacked (email accounts etc. ) the hackers do exactly this...they contact the support team and say they "lost their phone" to try and get coinbase or whoever to remove the 2FA, since it is essentially the only thing saving someone from losing their btc to the hacker. So coinbase probably just want to take some extra time to make sure the coins are actually going to the right person.
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:22:33
didn't bittrex disable btc deposits/withdraws temporarily?
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:47:19
Time has shown us it is becoming easier to buy bitcoin every single year. It will continue to get simpler for your average joe, and the price will continue to go up to accompany that ease of access... Also any difficulties you may experience when creating a bitcoin account (like a coinbase.com account for example) are security precautions that must be taken to secure your account, and your bitcoin (2FA, email confirmation etc.)... Being your own bank comes with responsibilities. Any other difficulties when trying to buy bitcoin (excessive identification and so forth) are due to regulatory compliance so that has nothing to do with the bitcoin protocol itself. Once you are in bitcoin it's super easy and fast to transact with others using bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:40:38
Well Coinjaf is correct. I have spoken to lots of different people and they are all excited to dump their BCC for more BTC including myself. It is almost like a shitcoin airdrop similar to how stellar lumens/byteball distribution is done...majority will sell the alt coin for more bitcoin. The economic majority (Miners, exchanges, wallets, etc) have decided that the current chain with pending segwit activation will remain BTC and the jihan fork chain will become an alt coin called BCC.
But apparently "there's a silent majority that isn't having their opinions showed" according to you....Hmm that's funny. I can hardly find anyone that is excited to hold and buy BCC. For it to be a majority like you say, that's a lot of people sitting in silence! I wonder why...perhaps because that majority you speak of does not exist?
But please do buy BCC. Somebody has to if we all want to be able to sell them. I wish you luck!
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:46:15
So he is skeptical but still dipping his toes in. This is good.
The idea of bitcoin will grow on him the more he learns. It almost always does :)
It's also important to note that he has realized the fact that there is not enough btc for everyone to own one full coin. More and more people will continue to have this realization as time goes on.
@_date: 2017-05-13 05:19:50
Not going to happen lol but if you are getting worried about this and did not take these types of scenarios into consideration before buying bitcoin, it sounds like you didn't do enough research and should probably consider selling. Otherwise you would know that hackers will always exist wherever there is anything internet related, and always have existed since the beginning with bitcoin. This is why bitcoin is so antifragile/secure. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 22:24:21
try the airbitz directory. They have a mobile app. They are also a good mobile bitcoin wallet to use.

I said many- NOT all! I do agree with what you said.
 But you and I both know that tends to be negative about EVERYTHING which is what I was getting at when I said they do not want bitcoin to succeed more or less.... Ranting and being negative about literally everything is not the way to a successful path forward.
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:36:07
Of course...with high reward comes the higher risk. 
as time goes on, and as bitcoin continues to prove its robustness over the years, and it becomes less and less likely to fail, its price will also continue to increase in value.

1) pay your capital gains tax.
2) don't pay your capital gains tax and risk the IRS coming after you (assuming you live in the US)
3) move to japan where bitcoin is legal tender.
4) HODL and dont worry about that decision yet
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:21:24
Well mainly because localbitcoins is a business more than a wallet to store bitcoins. So their top priority may not be to have the best and most convenient sending/receiving options for their customers. Whereas an actual bitcoin wallet's (Airbitz, Mycelium, Jaxx, Electrum, etc. ) job is to do exactly that. 
Hope that makes sense.

@_date: 2017-05-31 04:07:57
the eth devs WANT eth to move to PoS, just like the bitcoin devs WANT bitcoin to adopt segwit. its not a GUARANTEE at this point like you are making it out to be. I love how so many people just think that the eth miners will give up their stellar profits from mining $100-200 eth tokens for 2 months+ now so easily and switch over from proof of work. There will most likely be a governance/fork problem in ethereum in the near future similar to what bitcoin is going through right now. and the faster ethereum grows, the faster everyone will realize it's just as vulnerable to these sorts of things as bitcoin...if we're going to call the scaling debate etc. a vulnerability that is. Imo they are growing pains and nothing more. Eth is not perfect either, sorry.
And a lead eth dev since the beginning of the project agrees with me.

You cannot estimate how much you should pay in fees based on other confirmed transactions because the fee of each transaction depends on the inputs/outputs it takes to send which equates to Satoshi/KB
You can use this site to estimate how many satoshi/KB fee you should send with your transaction.
the time estimation is on the far right. hope this helps

First of all, take a deep breath. 
You do realize that bip91 activation periods are only like 2-3 days long right? Signalling was not supposed to begin until july 21st originally so some mining pools are taking their time and will not begin signalling until then, and they have every right to do so even if we (the users) are all very anxious for segwit to activate. There is still at least 5 other activation periods. Litecoin did not activate segwit until the 2nd or 3rd activation period and those were much longer than 2 days. If segwit is not activated in the next week or so more exchanges will give their stance on all of this and then you will have your answer about bitcoincash. Until then, sit tight.
tldr; RELAX and HODL!

There is no better way to show your support for segwit imo. one way is to sell to try and decrease the btc price and hope shit gets done then...another way is to buy litecoin and watch that go up while bitcoin goes side/ways up too rather than down.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:50:44
Fair enough..doesn't mean they should turn people away from the idea though. I am a bit salty about the 500% ETH rise but that doesn't mean i will lie and bash ethereum..because i understand it and know it has potential. I will however say it is extremely overpriced atm. lol 
I notice lots of people on that advise against bitcoin yet do not even know anything about it...they don't even know how to spell it half the time! (I see people writing Bit Coin all the time) That is what irks me...but i do see where you are coming from.

Transfer btc from coinbase to poloniex. On poloniex go to
Deposits &amp; withdrawals &gt; in the search tab type in "btc" &gt; click deposit address &gt; copy address, paste into coinbase and insert the amount of btc you wish to send.
Your coins will appear in your poloniex after 3 confirmations. Coinbase should send the appropriate fee ($2-$4 currently) so that your coins don't get stuck. Once your btc appear in your polo balance, go to the STR/BTC trading pair, and buy the amount of stellar you desire.
DO NOT take advice. He is over exaggerating as the bitcoin fee to send to polo is only a couple of dollars max, for high priority... If you took his advice and sold bitcoin for litecoin you would be paying way more in fees to coinbase, and also a litecoin transaction fee when sending to polo. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:06:01
Then feel free to sell your btc. Bitcoin has not bubbled. It's 100% gain the past few months is basically nothing in comparison to the 1000% price increase in all alt coins, or the 1000% increase in price bitcoin saw back in 2013.

The network is not too jammed at the moment. Down to ~40k unconfirmed transactions atm from over 200k a few weeks ago, and regardless bitcoin continues to operate.. But i do understand your concern nonetheless.

Yes I am facepalming too. This is why I can't take half of the eth lovers seriously. I like eth too but many of the new people to the crypto space who went straight for ethereum because of the hype, and happen to be the ones purchasing "flippening" mugs and claiming eth is flawless and better than bitcoin in every way are sadly mistaken. They are uneducated on cryptocurrencies and this is a perfect example. 
And the worst part is when you try to educate them, they don't want to hear it! New people are just out to get rich quick and find "the next bitcoin" So yes, I will continue to laugh and facepalm.
@_date: 2017-06-04 02:06:08
I don't care about what anybody on has to say, so yeah. Have not read that subreddit since they tried to scare me into selling my bitcoins 1 year ago before the halving, claiming that the 2016 bitcoin halving would result in a "doomsday scenario" and bitcoin would crash and burn. (and i will admit i almost fell for it. The FUD was strong at the time.) Well bitcoin is still here, stronger than ever. and has probably been nothing but  more negativity and propaganda since then.
Anyways, my answer to your question is very simple. Segwit + Lightning network are not bad. These are protocol upgrades that have been talked about (and are finally being worked on and hopefully implemented soon) in the bitcoin space for as long as I can remember. Why would the bitcoin devs and community members be discussing "bad" protocol updates for so many years?

The difficulty lies with the traditional banking system. Not with bitcoin itself. Once you have bitcoin and are transacting with bitcoin only, it's smooth sailing.
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:46:06
By that time, if bitcoin is to succeed, the price per bitcoin will be so high that the transaction fees alone will be more than enough incentive for the miners to continue securing the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 06:37:35
Seriously I was just thinking exactly this earlier today....it was a total shower thought too lol. 
IF UASF happens, why would anyone sell their bip 148 chain bitcoins and keep legacy chain coins when bip 148 coins will have segwit- and lightning network shortly after? Literally all the protocol upgrades people have been waiting for bitcoin to adopt will be on the bip 148 chain, and the majority are going to  instead choose to continue using the legacy chain over segwit + lightning network chain.....? That just makes absolutely no sense at all. If you put the fear of possible btc price drop (short term) to the side, and actually think about how this scenario will play out (assuming support continues to grow as it has been) then I think many will agree. 
Just HODL and all will be fine.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:23:35
It's still 2 months away, a lot can change in that time. I think either miners will activate segwit on their own without UASF before aug 1, or some miners will begin to show support for UASF in the next 2 months which will prevent the crippled scenario that you described. Either way it will be interesting to see what happens. Also I already have some litecoin, and am also a supporter of bip 148

"Can't even retire on a million dollars. Good idea to invest but he's missing out on important intellectual progress by not going to college, and he's rich for his age but not rich for an adult."
Did you ever consider that he could go back to college at any point in his life if he felt he wanted/needed more of the important intellectual progress you speak of? Sure you can't retire on $1m but it's incredibly easy to make more money if you have $1m to work with as long as you are not an idiot. He's rich for his age, which puts him 10-20+ years ahead of his peers. That's quite the head start if you ask me! 
And finally your last comment:
 "He will pay the price for this decision over his lifetime."
What a stupid thing to say. The jealousy is real with this one. There are definitely pros and cons to everything (including skipping college because you got rich off of bitcoin), but to say that "he will pay the price for this decision for the rest of his life" is literally retarded lol. It seems to me like the people that will be "paying the price for the rest of their lives" are those who mocked bitcoin investors early on and are now realizing that they will most likely be stuck working a 9-5 job for the rest of their lives when they could have retired early by simply having an open mind- rather than laughing at those who did.

"hodlers still refuse to sell high and buy low, as if their religion doesn't permit them."
this market is full of tricks to get those hodlers to panic sell their bitcoin. it has nothing to do with their "Religion not permitting them" but everything to do with past personal experiences. It has happened HUNDREDS of times in the history of bitcoin. One example is how in january there were talks of a hardfork combined with ETF denial. I can tell you that many hodlers let go of at least some of their bitcoins during that time..only to be slapped in the face having to buy higher at a later date which resulted in said hodlers owning LESS bitcoin, and some rich motherfucker with enough money to shake up the market to end up with MORE bitcoin. I can also tell you this is why many hodlers refuse to make the same mistake again and would rather just ride out the price swings and hold for the long term..hence the reference HODL.

Bitcoin transaction fees were always going to increase in dollar amounts when the price of bitcoin increased to $1-$2k+. It was only a matter of time. And it will stay this way until we get SW + LN (hopefully soon). The difference is that you can send $10,000+ for the same $2.50 fee. Guess how much paypal would charge you to send that amount of money? WAY MORE than $2.50.
So get out of here with your pathetic screenshot. We both know that title is BS and lies.

It is most likely not insolvency and im sorry but you sound like an idiot. They have gotten over 50,000 new customers in the past 2 months and are making more money than ever. Being short staffed/unable to cope with the mass influx of new users is nowhere near the same thing as being insolvent. I have been withdrawing $2k/day for weeks with no problems whatsoever and many others have been able to withdraw successfully as well. I understand there are also many people who have withdrawals pending and support tickets unanswered but please do not jump to conclusions.

It is blatantly obvious imo, but as there is no "proof" of that... all we can really say is that from the looks of it, people all-in on alts' interests just so happen to be perfectly aligned with those who oppose segwit / BIP148 for other reasons.
What a coincidence!

Just hold and do nothing. Make sure your coins are in your own possession and not stored on a site like coinbase or any exchange. 
I planned a 2 week vacation (end of july to mid august) so that i'm not stressing over a potential short term price drop and FUD on reddit. Once the dust settles bitcoin will be just fine, and hopefully better than ever (assuming UASF is successful)

Remember the halving doomsday scenario about 13-14 months ago? It's all people talked about for 2-3 months before july. The august 1st doomsday scenario reminds me a lot of that.
 FWIW the price doubled right around the time of the "doomsday" last year.

Great comment haha. Sorry you feel you have missed the boat :\ I know the feeling..That's exactly how I felt when I heard bitcoin had spiked to $1200 back in 2013. I had planned to buy a significant amount just a few weeks beforehand at $90 per btc but was too lazy and never got around to it. Lucky for me I was given a second chance and started buying from $800...the entire way down to $200. Was a rough two years, but my patience has finally paid off to say the least lol
Wish you luck with your other investments!
@_date: 2017-06-04 23:04:50
What you need to realize is that it's not bitcoin that's difficult, it's the traditional banking system that makes bitcoin difficult + slow to buy.  Once you have bitcoin and start transacting in bitcoin it's really the easiest thing. 
Bitcoin is not anonymous. It's pseudonymous.

This is how it has always been. RIP to the many who are all in on ethereum and probably drink their coffee every day out of the flippening mugs they purchased. At the end of the day your goal should be having more bitcoin than you did before the alt bubble. It's always about getting more bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-06-05 00:27:11
No, it is naive to think the economic majority will sell their coins on the chain that will have segwit + lightning network shortly after (BIP148), and go back to the legacy chain with no upgrades (not BIP148). As another reddit user has mentioned below, the miners will follow the money.

Ethereum foundation decided to fork to bail out a few wealthy investors. Thus it is not immutable. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 23:14:25
Ok well I don't use gdax so i didn't know that, but also i doubt he even knows what maker/taker is so he would 99% be just market buying...= fees. So he's definitely better off just using btc.
It's not about loving a coin, it's about you overreacting over a $2 fee like it's the end of the world while confusing OP at the same time. He has not figured out how to buy stellar with his btc yet. What on earth makes you think he knows how to buy litecoin with his btc? All he asked was how to transfer his btc to polo and you go rambling on about how he can possibly save 1 dollar and how bitcoin is too expensive rather than just answering his question. And i'm the pathetic one....right.

@_date: 2017-06-10 20:19:58
Sure, I'm happy to explain.
So for example when ethereum had a fork last year and the chain split, both eth and etc had some value. Coinbase did not want to give people their etc, even though it is rightfully theirs. But because those people stored their coins with coinbase, they weren't really their coins. If you had your coins in your own wallet that would never happen.
So come august 1st at the time of UASF if bitcoin forks into 2 chains, there's a chance a similar scenario may happen. Incase it does, If your coins are in your own wallet you will 100% have your coins on both chains and can then sell the weaker coin for some extra $ if you want when it's clear which coin will retain most of the value.
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:25:02
While this is true, imo it's important to keep in mind that not ALL blockchains are decentralized and immutable like bitcoins blockchain....just my two cents.

If the federal reserve bank/central banking system "mysteriously shut down (or collapsed)" and all your currency went to nothing overnight, how would you go about killing yourself? 
On a more serious note, Bitcoin has been running non stop, with no down time for the past 7 years or more. I think it's going to be fine :) 
And to answer your question, I would jump off a bridge. If i had to kill myself that is ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Just because you can't see why it's appreciating in value first hand does not mean there isn't a good reason. Bitcoin is the most efficient way, and sometimes the only way (depending on where you live) to move large amounts of money across the globe. It's definitely not "slow" when compared to any other method of moving wealth globally, and operates 24/7 for the past 7 years no down time. In places like Venezuela, Brazil, etc. people DEPEND on bitcoin. It is their only way to protect themselves from hyperinflation and the likes. This will not stop either, it's only going to continue in more countries around the world in the short term. 
Yes bitcoin is not "the perfect currency" at the moment (for smaller transfers) because of increasing transaction fees, but when the segwit + lightning network protocol upgrades are implemented that will be fixed. It is also important to keep in mind that part of the reason the transaction fees are becoming more and more expensive in USD terms as of recently is because the price per bitcoin is also becoming more and more expensive in USD as of recently! They go hand in hand.
Hope this helps.

These are two very different things and he is not reaching.
He's just not explaining it very well imho.
Let me try and explain the difference to you
 Mt gox was a bitcoin exchange carelessly run by a third party. Nothing to do with bitcoin on a protocol level. The hack occurred, people lost their money, and nothing on the blockchain was altered/rolled back afterwards. This is a perfect example of why bitcoin is considered to be immutable. It is one of its strong points in the long term.
When the DAO hack occurred in eth, it was a hacker that was able to penetrate the poorly coded DAO smart contract and move the funds into his own wallet. Again not exactly a flaw on the protocol level..more so than the mt gox hack but that's besides the point I am trying to make here. Anyways - moving on...So the hacker was able to steal $100M worth of eth and move it into his own wallet. A catastrophe just like the mt gox hack but things happen, and life goes on as would the blockchain. But because of the fact that the majority of the $100m belonged to a small number of wealthy investors, the ethereum foundation + vitalik buterin decided to instead perform a hardfork to recover the funds back from the hacker and return them to the wealthy investors which essentially resulted in a bailout, and from that point forward ethereum could no longer be considered an immutable blockchain. 
Many new investors aren't even aware this happened, or they don't care to learn all the facts, but it is definitely something to take into consideration if you are considering to invest a substantial amount in ethereum long term, or trying to compare bitcoin to ethereum.
Hope this helped.

It is absolutely inaccurate reporting imo. The total cap is set to 21m and while it is *POSSIBLE* to change that number, it is *basically IMPOSSIBLE to make that change go through* as very very few in the  bitcoin community (if anyone) would ever want to make that change. The 21m cap in bitcoin is one of its strong points, it's not a flaw. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:44:18
No.. I have sent around 10+ btc regularly and never paid more than $1-$3 and always get confirmed in the first block.
@_date: 2017-06-27 06:27:24
I agree.
Also I could honestly care less about the block size increase, but segwit2x means segwit *first* which is really all that matters to me... I guess I support any BIP implementation where segwit comes first. If the hard fork afterwards does not happen, then oh well lol. I just want segwit so that LN can finally become a reality afterwards!

"I am currently using CoinHako, I am afraid that while sending bitcoins from my Coinhako wallet to my ledger, that it is lost for some reason. How possible is such a scenario
Lets say I successfully transfer the coins to my ledger, I am concerned the same thing will happen if I transfer my BTC to an exchange. Again, how likely are such scenarios"
If you enter the bitcoin address properly and use an appropriate fee, 0% likelihood of this occuring. Even if you dont use an appropriate fee your bitcoin will never be "lost", rather just inaccessible for some days, and then returned to your original bitcoin wallet after. (worst case scenario)
"In the event where bitcoin does reach 100K, and we intend to sell on an exchange, who can realistically buy these at such exhorbitant prices. No use having 1 million BTC if you can't sell it"
When bitcoin reaches these prices you won't need to sell them to buy things...you will be able to buy things directly with bitcoin such as cars, houses etc. since it's much more efficient to transact in bitcoin. As you can see this trend is already starting. See  for example.
"I've read that transaction fees are going through the roof, could it scale to a level where transferring 1million BTC would result in fees amounting to 500K for example?"
If the price per bitcoin was in the millions, then sure that is possible. Because the transaction fee in dollar amounts correlates to the bitcoin price. Transaction fees do seem "through the roof" lately because the bitcoin price is also going "through the roof" make sense? At the moment you could send hundreds of bitcoins (300 for example) to be confirmed within the first block (20 minutes or so) and not have to pay a fee of over $5, maybe $10 TOPS. So that would be like sending $1m across the globe securely within 20 minutes without having to pay more than a $5-$10 fee. For large bitcoin transactions like that especially, bitcoin is pretty remarkable as it beats the fees of any traditional banking institution (Banks, WU, or any other method to transfer $ globally) by a longshot, and always will! So from that aspect the transaction fees are not "through the roof" at all.
Now for small transactions, the fees do indeed seem to be going "through the roof" and will most likely remain this way until bitcoin gets the necessary protocol upgrades to fix this problem (Segwit + Lightning Network).  Hopefully we see this happen in August!
