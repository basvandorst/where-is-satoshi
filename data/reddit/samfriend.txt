Always good to see someone wanted to kill Youtube, started as a thief, growed as a bass-ass dictate robber
It won't work until everyone on earth is having 10G internet. 
make a tumblr mix youtube site, content providers get their own mini site, they have full control on their own mini site but they will pay some fees (bandwidth plans).
There are hundreds of ways to make money on this platform, but first to tackle those famous content providers, get them to your platform, do not take any advantages from them, create new winwin products when 50-100 top tiers content providers joined you.

Don't buy if it drops to $500, because that means something really bad happened and it will take very long time to recover. Buy it when it goes above 1100, because it will then keep going until 4000...

People always use world population/ wealth to project Bitcoin future value, but Bitcoin is actually impossible to serve as an currency for even 100m people at this moment.
And I think as current bitcoins decentralized structure, without adding another layer on top, it's technically impossible for Bitcoin to serve as an currency for world's population.
Please correct me if I am wrong... I always wanted to clarify this question...

I pretty sure there someone already program to bridge these gaps and making money after the 1000USD peak last week.
Cause I can see the mtgox &lt;&gt; Btcchina price is sync in less than 5 seconds. Mtgox drops, China drops in 5 secs. Their price gap always around 8% (mtogx 10,000, mtcchina 10,800).

Ok, from my own projection of the Chinese attitude to BTC, it was like the Central Govt (the Matrix) said BTC don't go too wild, we need things to cool down a bit and under control. THEN, the local Govt/ Financial officials (Ass Kissers) jumped out and removed CTCC payments gateway, and then things went worst! You need to understands China very well in order to judge Who's Voice has the power and Who's Voice is going to by-pass, otherwise you will dead in a very ugly way.
So basically, The Matrix didn't want to kill BTC, it's the Local Officials took away the payment gateway, who know they wanted to kiss-an-ass OR they wanted Toll-fee, but I think BTCC will solve it soon (They JV and went to 'talk')
Also, do you know what are the most wealthy people in China? Who wanted to have vehicles to digitally move their 10XBillions out the country? ya, It's them!!
Illegal / grey area means nothing, Dead sentence for owning online-gambling sites in China, do you know how many chinese casino there? do you know how much is the daily turnover? no to say BTC is legal
Li Ka Shing lives in HK, but his ears are all over the world, especially high from China, do u think he will invest in something which China says its prohibited tomorrow? that will make him no face.

Good news approved, the new BTCC voucher move was brilliant, the JV to 'talk' to someone for a clean 'path ahead' also is the smart way to go (PAY THE TOLL FEE MAN!),  Lee Ka Shing's investment to Bitpay also a very good sign of bitcoin's success and yes, LKS's and his teams sure will always dine with high in power and chat will a lot of stuffs.
Also, the 'Cold Water' was the Best thing, to shake away those powerless btc holders, these ppl always is the factor of collapse, i saw a lot from China during the 1200USD. I personally hope China will move up slowly, unlike last time, it was not healthy...
Oh another very good sign is BTCC stared to charge commission, this will get the industry revenue, wealth = more $$ for security, main stream, and deep pocket to pay the TOLL FEE.
If you remember, I told you BTCC's payment gateway will gone 22 days ago when the China Report Released, see it's gone now. BTC is back and its sexy again, China's Exchanges are getting revenue instead of fighting each others like animals, It's time to buy more coins, 2014 will be too late for the ride.

The panda is the main reason I invest in Bitcoin. They are crazy, period. Once bitcoin mutate to a money making vehicle for them, it will shoot the price to the moon. I would say if bTC values at 2,000 - 10,000, then its a 'better' subject for them to play with. Also, the main reason why pandas wanted to invest in btc? Its safer to invest in the anonymous digital gold, rather than 10-100 real-estates under your own name, yeah?
However, Pandas will also breaks btc! They are a threat to the bitcoin community. 
See, if you guys can read chinese, there are around 5 bitcoin exchanges in China now. They already declared war on each others. Now, ZERO commissions, only when u exit to flat money. Some even offer rebates lol. I really doubt these panda exchange's operations, their applications, servers, securities...etc. They operate an exchange just like operating another webstore.... Someone will go totally wrong just matter of time. I also doubt these exchange's creditability, are they really keeping those Bitcoins? are they really have such inventory? are these accounts real human at all??
See, if one day, something outrages breaks out, the while BTC will collapse these threat to the ommunity.

im beginner, but i guess btcchina ? chinese are crazy, and they dont have access to overseas transfers nor foreign currency, they are trapped in china-exchanges, and all chinese exchanges are starting to war each others now they dont charge any commission and even offer rebates (50% of profits) to users! 
I m lucky, i can read, open account there.

It's a perfect medium to store wealth anonymously, say you got 100M, where should you hide it? bank account? nah, gold bars at home? nah, real-estates overseas? nah, fake business owned by your trusted friend? nah

All financial institutions should not provide services, include providing customers with Bitcoin registration, trading, clearing and settlement services...
Agencies should be set up branches and offer Bitcoin registration, trade and other services in the area of ​​anti-money laundering regulation into law, and urge them to strengthen anti-money laundering monitoring.
IMPORTANT! **from my own understanding** Please confirm the meanings yourself! 
1) btcChina's payment gateway might be lost or a lot more difficult now
2) law enforcements will heavily monitor these exchanges for money laundering
