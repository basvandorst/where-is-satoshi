California Spectrum Care, the non-profit I work for has applied and one of our main focuses is providing services for the higher functioning group of people with autism. You're right. The Current system doesn't really have a place for those that suffer from less severe forms of developmental disabilities. Unfortunately, most other companies cater towards the more severe disabilities, and even the funding in this industry tends to avoid the higher functioning individual. The state doesn't believe that a high functioning person needs 1-to-1 care, so they end up never getting the attention they need to address any deficits they may have. Hopefully, we can help change this attitude.

Sorta, but with out the fungibility and cryptographically secure nature of bitcoin, it wouldn't work.

I think he means inflation is necessary to pay off previous debts, which are payed off with larger amounts of debt because of interest. Without inflation our current monetary system could not work; well most likely not work. You could argue that with a high enough velocity of money you could probably service the interest bearing debt without inflation.

If times money, go pay a programmer a few hundred bucks and be done. The hardest part in my opinion would be retrieving the transactions from the block chain, after that it should be super simple for anybody to create a quickbooks compatible spreadsheet.

Considering that these happen 4-5 times a month. I would assume low volume due to weekends.

The article is arguing that the interest paid by the Federal Reserve to the banks for their excess reserves is essentially funded by taxpayers. 
Here's another article that explains the argument better.
Don't really see how this has much to do with bitcoin though, but most people here would probably argue that constant inflation wouldn't be necessary if there was no fractional reserve lending.

Being anonymous was one of Satoshi's highest priorities. At this point it would be nearly impossible to sell these coins and remain anonymous. I think we can safely assume they won't ever be touched.

From my understanding, panasonic produces all the batteries. Tesla just owns the space. I could be wrong though.

They also have to compete with all other car manufacturers at some point. GM already beat Tesla to the market with the first "affordable" electric car with range over 200 miles. Nissan will have their revised leaf out soon. BMW has their iSeries. Porsche is working on Luxury electric cars. I don't think it will take much effort for any major manufacturer to increase production of electric cars once the demand is present. Tesla could easily get stuck becoming a niche gadgety-luxury brand if any other manufacturer decides to undercut the model 3. It's pretty much a must for them to hang on to their "cool" factor. Any widespread reliability issues in their mainstream cars can kill that in an instant. One of the reasons I don't have my money in Tesla.

and where does that new value come from? If I borrow a few thousand dollars of tools and a few thousand dollars of supplies, then make a 100 thousand dollar house. The guy I bought the tools from wants to buy my house, but hey he only has a few thousand dollars in the bank. Well guess he has to go get a mortgage which bears interest. Now we just created 100k in new debt off a few thousand.

That's not what I was getting at, I was trying to say that any new value generated from a loaned asset will have to also have a debt associated with it somewhere within the system. From my understanding, nearly all money is generated through lending. So to pay for the new service or product, there would have to be new debt/money to pay for it. ORRRR the velocity of money would have to increase which is what your example kinda explains.

Ehhh, when you break it down to Cost per Mile. You're probably not coming out to far ahead buying an old beater vs new and driving it until the wheels fall off. Especially if you get cheap electricity and go electric.

What is that an hourly chart? Zoom out to the daily and you don't have the same pattern yet. Looks like we may bounce off the 7 day moving average at the moment.

Yup, doesn't change the fact it's subjective.... you got words in there like rapid, and without risk. Both terms which can have varied meanings to different people.
