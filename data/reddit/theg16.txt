I once read a study that once someone makes enough money to not care about money, more money doesn't increase happiness. Like, the difference between all the money I need and all the money I need plus some is rather moot. 
But I see your point.

Yeah I give it 2 weeks and were at 10k/BTC. Then about 2hours and were down to 750/BTC.

40Gigs is small. Even if it increased by 40 gigs a year, it would still be small. 1Tb drive would allow you to be a node for 25 years if it increased at 40gigs/year.

If all you're doing is holding then generate a seeded wallet on an offline computer and pound out the seed key on a piece of copper. It's what I did. Works like gangbusters. Costs about 25$ for a punch set and plate of copper from Amazon. Should hold up in a house fire pretty well. ~1000*c melting point. 
@_date: 2015-09-17 02:59:21
Yeah it'll eventually, after a long long time, turn green in appearance. For it to be destroyed completely would take so long I'd probably be dead before that happened.
@_date: 2015-09-14 03:30:49
I memorized my seed key with a copper plate and letter punch set. Copper has a melting point of over 1000*C, I think it'll last though a house fire.
But then I went and put the plate in a safety deposit box at the bank.

Pleb. I got 13000 BTC for 0$.

Correct. And since they have increased in availability, so have they in popularity. Doesn't matter which came first, only the trend matters.

FUCK I'm so glad I never bought at $0.03 or $3 or $73 or $239. I would hate myself today if I had. Obvious downtrend here.
@_date: 2015-10-12 01:45:19
Sounds like it would be really hard to track something like that. From what I've seen, those who get caught doing that were using the localbitcoins service and sending them to known escrow addresses.

You gotta ask yourself, is cash on the rise in popularity or on the decline? When I was in high school, it was pretty common to see people pay in cash. Almost 15 years later and I do not know a single person who uses cash on a daily basis. The trend is moving heavily towards us being a cashless society, for better or worse.

Back to 600's before going over 750. Not long after that 1000, then 1200, then new ATH of 1800$ but it wont stop there. In just six months time, THREE MILLION DOLLARS EACH!
@_date: 2015-10-10 03:55:49
100k is a lot of money. That is more than the average cost of a home where I live, and much of the country I'm in. Only rich people look at an amount of money that would afford a house and say "thats not a lot of money". 
@_date: 2013-05-19 05:02:22
Impossible for a human to remember? Please.... Either way, you stamp it on copper and you dont need to remember it. You use the seed key not to sign transactions, but to recover your key pairs under certain circumstances. 
So called brain wallets are secure, this is fact. Like ANY security, if not used properly, is useless. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 04:20:31


This statement is not true. If you choose a very short or predictable phrase for the seed key, of course it is insecure. Otherwise....

@_date: 2013-04-06 05:30:56
I'd say the value is 1BTC. Couldn't really tell you why people are paying nearly 10x that for one. It's just 1BTC in "physical" format. 
@_date: 2013-05-18 21:19:03
Obviously you don't understand what Im  saying. If all asic miners cost the same kW/GH then the amount of GH you have is moot when it comes to profitability.
Edit: an investment that makes profit after just a year is an amazing investment.

Be different the currently available options. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 09:27:26
Those who have a lot of money in BTC are vested to promote it to increase their value.

If you don't know the advantage of holding a seed key vs a private key, then I'm done debating the security of them with you.
@_date: 2013-05-18 10:31:51
The difficulty will be too high for a 5Gh asic miner to profit? Are you stoned? It's not about raw power, its all about your hashrate to power ratio. Doesn't matter if you're doing 1Gh or 1000Gh, if the ratio of power consumption is the same, it is equally as profitable.

Why do laymen need to know the technicalities of how a brain wallet works, and what exactly a private key is? Would you educate your grandmother on boolean logic when she wants to search something on the internet?

I stamped my seed key on copper plate. Way cooler.

Gyft has lots of dollars, and they give it to amazon when someone gives them bitcoin. They decide to keep the bitcoin. Where do they get the initial dollars?
... From a loan or investment obviously. 
(when I say "they keep the bitcoin" this is only conjecture in a comical sense. It is not meant to be taken as fact. They may just as well be offing them on the exchange as quick as they can. Who knows? 
@_date: 2013-08-02 09:51:51
Etching metals was my first thought. My second, and final thought, was to purchase a cheap letter punch set and pound out on copper plate. FYI DIY-ers.

localbitcoins.com ? they do charge a fee.
@_date: 2013-05-19 04:52:05
Yeah google up on how much power is required to make a 256bit key seem "short and predictable".
A proper seed key is just as secure as any public/private keypair. You do realize you can crack private keys based just on the public key, right? Given enough computing power of course.
