Am highly impressed with the lightening speed of LN,
I think what is happening right now in Chicago lounge's in terms of micro transactions is a clear sign that LN is the key to mass adoption of bitcoin as a payment mechanism in all businesses around the world

There is nothing wrong in telling people about Cryptocurrencies,
But telling them how much worth of crypto you own is wrong.
Keeping it reasonably on a low,
You will have more rest of mind lol

Privacy is key!
And I think it will be wise to keep it on a low instead of publicizing ones Crypto portfolio, it not advisable from my opinion.
Its more like going online to declare your net worth to the world!
You should be ready to face whatever that comes after that.

This is simply disastrous for any nation!
We're talking about well over 67 billion USD every 3 weeks and 3 days!
Bitcoin truly is still in it infancy, we're only just getting started lol

Trying to promote there business and at the same time spread the word about bitcoin.
Its a smart move and a win-win.
Nice one!
