At the onset of 2008 global financial crisis, it was China calling for alternative financial system and calling USD off as the world's trade currency. The same year Satoshi Nakamoto appeared and bitcoin started.

BTC will never reach ath this year, but 2019 most probably yes. The rest of 2018 is accumulation/consolidation phase.

That's what i do as a day trader. Increasing my btc holding thru day trading.
@_date: 2018-04-02 09:54:34
Don't be afraid, you need not worry. Just send me your btc and I'll handle it for you.
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:15:41
Trade it on bitmex and increase your btc holding.

can't agree enough, the price run-up was out of proportion and this "correction" is timely and badly needed if bitcoin is to stay for long the reserve currency of the crypto space.

exactly, still trading here on the downtrend to accumulate more bitcoins and do profit taking whenever there's opportunity.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:50:37
trade your way down the downtrend to earn additional btc. focus on gaining profit in btc, the inverse of gaining profit in fiat during run-up.if you have extra funds, cost average buying btc in dips. HODLING is not a TRADING strat, it's a HOARDING strat.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:02:37
even if you sell low as long as you keep buying lower, you will still make profit in btc.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:29:53
this is gonna go below 2000 but not lower than 1500, says my two crystal balls.
