And because its the king, the subordinates shouldnt mind hours for transactions and high fees - it is just that good.

We've also had threads full of people claiming they just found a bunch of bitcoin and are super happy with it. Usually they have more than THAT ONE POST on their account and the stories sound kind of believable. This one not so much.

So let me get this - not only did you firstly invest 1500$ and forgot about it completely, but also over the last YEARS you never came in contact with the news or internet or even other people, where bitcoin comes up every week or so?
Please if you make up bullshit be more believable.

I dont know, does it not bother you?
Is it because you dont use btc? Is it because you dont think its that bad and really just a mild inconvenience? Do you with honesty believe that its not a major issue with bitcoin at the moment?
Or do you just not want to admit it..?

Its nice but honestly you dont have to browse subreddits seperately, they have this "subscribe" button on the right side which takes all the subs posts and brings them together on your home page..
Jokes aside tho, nice effort but the layout is kinda ugh. Also it doesnt help that you cannot really see what kind of post it is - most stuff posted in r/bitcoin for example are post like "hurr durr muh transaction costs" and not news. Also memes. On reddit you can preview text posts and pictures, which saves the time to click on everything.

How do you "accelerate bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:47:30


In the bitcoin sub AHAHAHA
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:19:17


This really is the only point to talk about here. Invest the amount you want that you can afford and accept to lose completely. Just imagine you getting hacked and its all gone - if you accept it as a possibility you can invest it.
The rest is just stuff a lot of people have different opinions about anyway.

Maybe something changed the format. You should bring this question over to one of the IT subs, its not really a btc related question - maybe they can help you.

And while you're at it, can you please give me the numbers for next weeks lottery..?
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:05:06
You can still say "hodl" without being called stupid - surely easier than talking about those hardcore capitalists.
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:20:31
Since you talk about 95% and "largely", you tell me which letters do have a real function and arent useless and make my point for me, ok?
@_date: 2018-05-19 02:11:51
How are they useless, just because they are worse in some aspects? Its not like they have no advantages. Bitcoin also has major drawbacks to money, I know you wont accept that but its the truth, the posts implication that bitcoin to money is like mobiles to landline is just silly.
@_date: 2018-05-18 21:10:17
I mean, letters were doing a pretty good job until email came alone, but we still have a post office for good reasons. 
Just because something new comes along, its not automatically better - just look at every second thing on kickstarter.
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:45:19
Shit all this time I thought Bitcoin is when you sell the bits from your computer and get coins for that? Man, thanks for posting a basic explanation in this sub I'm sure many people appreciate your help.
Shit aside please stop advertising your website. Its nothing helpful or new, its nothing anybody here needs, its the only thing your account does.
