you don't "invest" in bitcoin - if you wana gamble, then we're talking.

you are playing a very dangerous game my friend. Never risk your future AND your families future on especially something like this.
You are asking if not this then what? simply put most of your funds into high interest savings that will give you almost nothing - but at least it will not disappear overnight. ONLY put funds into crypto that you are 100% fine with losing it all. I would never put myself  and my family into the situation you have created. You have balls bro.

this is gambling money and if it all goes to shit then thats okay though i learned quickly that i shouldnt have deposited as much as i did.
With all that being said - DUBAICOIN dbix saved my ass --- bought at 2$ and sold at 30 - this allowed me to only be at a 20% current loss of my total deposited. If i had just kept BTC, it would have looked uglier.....but fudge, looks like we've lost so much momentum on BTC

e-commerce checkout system payment integration solutions.
example -you have a drupal ecomm site and you want to start accepting btc for purchases - you can write a module for drupal/php btc accepting and payment processing.....extend this idea to any framework

omfg, that was fun. HODL 4 lyfe - when shit like this happens have your buy orders ready
my exchange froze for 4 mins everything disabled, managed to squeeze in a buy still at the bottom.

me: how much bitcoin would you like to purchase?
customer: just 1 bitcoin is fine (typical response)
me: 1 btc is around 17k now
customer: oh dear

you guys are on the right track and this solution will be needed more and more, the confirmation time is gona be hard to get buy-in on from a user though, waiting like 1.5 hrs wont work
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:03:09
there isnt one best one....there are a couple of really big ones that majority of ppl use. i personally use binance after moving through a bunch of different ones.
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:55:23
yup, no guarantee though, i waited for 3 hrs for my last transaction. because of this, its tough to make any integrated payment solutions work until there are changes to confirmation times.

use qaudrigaCX but the signup process will take time. send it to me i can etransfer you.
