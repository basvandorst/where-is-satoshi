Hey everyone. I have been photographing weddings for several years now, and have finally set up my wedding-only website. I have been a Bitcoin enthusiast for some time now, and decided it was high time to allow my clients to pay with this currency. Please take a look and let me know what you think. If you would like to promote this as well as like the Facebook page, I would be very grateful.
Thanks for being an awesome community! :)

A good portion are. You need to understand risk assessment to realize why most banks are predatory in their lending. Giving an 18-year old a t-shirt to get their information? That's ridiculous.
Furthermore, credit itself is a joke. If I keep all open credit lines at 0, my credit score drops. If I do not borrow, and need to for something like a house, my credit is worthless. The entire system is jacked up. So, no, I am not "off the deep end". My eyes just happen to be wide open to the cronyism that runs America.

Yes, they do. Because predatory lending still exists thanks to the collusion between banks and government.

How do you make money in all of this? You know what they say: if you're not paying for it, you're the product.
Sounds like a great idea though.

There are rumors that Paypal is considering incorporating Bitcoin as a payment option. Also, check out It's only a concept, but one that would solve quite a bit as the blockchain evolves. If Paypal does not jump on Bitcoin now, Ethereum will fix that in the near future.

Everyone had credit cards when Paypal first came around. Paypal adoption shows that Bitcoin adoption is possible and far more likely. Honestly, technophobic remarks like this one show up so often around new technology that I've grown fairly immune to it.  Never underestimate the adoptive power of new technology.
