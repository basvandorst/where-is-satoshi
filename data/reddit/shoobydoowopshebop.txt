Not any more than bitcoin. I absolutely guarantee you that the industrial uses of gold, platinum, iridium, palladium etc. are negligible and that their value as a commodity is 100% disconnected from their industrial applications.


Bitcoin allows you to transact large sums of money across the world without any banking middlemen.  Do you know how much it costs to remit USD&lt;-&gt;GBP&lt;-&gt;EUR&lt;-&gt;JPY&lt;-&gt;CNY? It's like 50USD per transaction + some percentage.  Thus bitcoin has an intrinsic use.  It also allows the storage of wealth in a non-inflationary currency. You can feel free to argue that the value is inflated or a bubble, but there *is* an intrinsic use.

That's just because it's what you're used to.
There is literally 0 reason to use imperial over metric aside from the fact that it's what everyone in the US uses, and is used to, and expects.


???  Precision is precision.  It doesn't really matter if your units of precision are 0.01mm or 1/1024 in.

That's nothing. I went to Vegas, put all my retirement savings on Black, and *won*! Doubled my money!
Just because you didn't die last time doesn't mean it's a good idea to juggle knives.

Litecoin has several unique advantages over bitcoin/other altcoins, and in some ways synergizes very well with BTC:
1) Scrypt over SHA-256 means that ASICs are harder to build, meaning less centralization of mining.  (I am not technically savvy enough to know what negative effects this has.)
2) Smaller block period. This means faster confirms.  (avg. 1.25 minutes instead of 5).  (Also more thoroughput, but only linear scale.)
3) Less users. This combined with 2 means less fees.  (Also means less places to use/spend.)
4) No major whales from early on in the adoption process. Bitcoin has a slow adoption process and certain miners got tons of bitcoin. Certain diehard acolytes mined a *ton* of bitcoin in the early year(s). It is estimated that Satoshi has *one million* bitcoin.  If he wanted to cash out, do you know how fast the market would tank?.  Litecoin does not have this problem as it came after bitcoin had already been established and people already understood the underlying technology better.  (Note: Litecoin solved this problem. BCH did not.)
5) Active development period that has been applying cutting-edge scaling solutions faster than bitcoin core. Now, personally, as an engineer, I like new technological advancements. They're fun.  But when it comes to my ~~bank account~~ crypto wallet, I want slow thorough code review like core has.  I want there to be 800 different people looking over the code before a commit is made. I want the technologies implemented to have been tested in the real world in other cryptos first.  I want engineers, not marketers or entrepreneurs in charge. So to me, I'm more inclined to keep with BTC, but this is a good place for synergy between BTC and LTC.)  Also because the development community is smaller, that means it's easier to get consensus. The block size debate lasted for years in bitcoin and should have lasted like one month at most.
6) Cross-chain LN swaps have been done between LTC and BTC.  This means that it's highly likely that once the LN is running full speed, LTC and BTC will be able to operate more or less in one ecosystem.  You'll be able to LN spend BTC from your LTC, going through whichever bi-coin channels there are.  This also likely means that LTC and BTC will form an intertwined ecosystem in the future.  There's going to be decentralized BTC/LTC not-exchanges throughout the LN, adding one more layer of decentralization.
Of the above, only BCH's approach only applies to (3) (solve scaling problem by not having any users), and half-ass solved (2) (increased block size which allows for larger thoroughput, but still has the avg. 5 min confirm time under optimal scenarios.)

If you took the word "ponzi" out of that, that would have been a very astute economic analysis.
What you just said reflects the value of *every* commodity, asset, or good.  What do you think decides the price of gold?

And the reason that it operated counter to its specification was....?
Oh yeah, because it was a conversion mistake.  Accidentally converting between units when you don't expect to is a de facto conversion mistake.


Except for when your satellites [crash into the surface of Mars](

A software issue being that there's a conversion error.
That's like saying, "Oh, it's not a conversion error, I forgot to multiply by the correction factor. It's a multiplication error."
Failure to convert where you should, or converting incorrectly, is a conversion error. That's the definition of a conversion error. That's what happened.  Do you think a conversion error is when you plug in 25.4 instead of 2.54 for the in/cm ratio?

Those are exchanges.

Yeah, it sucks when I travel to Japan, use my credit card, and it automatically converts the USD into JPY and they get paid in JPY and I pay in USD and the credit card company takes a 0.1% cut above the forex rate. (1USD is about 10,000 JPY)
The size of the tokens doesn't matter.
And it's going to be way less than 0.1% in fees.

Yes we do, because this would only happen once every 10^12480 years (or whatever insanely huge number) if it were random bytes.  It's not random bytes.

Why the hell is that dumbshit representing exponential data on a linear graph, and why should I listen to anyone who is stupid enough to do that?
