You should check [your transaction in Blockr.io]( as a back up.

Old urls are redirected to the  domain. Earlier, we had a server with missing RewriteRule. That was within couple of hours after the change. Sorry to see you were bitten by this.

Transactions are send to the bitcoin network immediatelly but that doesn't mean much. What is important is when your transaction is included in a block. This is done when miners pick your transaction, calculate block hash and send this block to the network. At that point is your transaction confirmed and included in blockchain.
When exactly will miners pick your transaction to be included in block cannot be said in advance. It could be immediatelly or it could be couple of hours (maybe a day). It helps if you add some fee to miners.
So that's why your transactions do not appear in blockchain instantly (or as fast as you'd like).
What is a "Conflict message" that you're referring to in your post?

off topic - did you try any API at [blockr.io?](

What's the point of re-rolling those amounts of BTC?

PushTX is for testnet also. **All our APIs work the same on mainnet and testnet**.
URL for testnet push_tx is

Yes, testnet is already available in API calls. All you have to do is point your API calls to tbtc.blockr.io domain.
For example, API call for mainnet is:
and API call for testnet would be
(tbtc.blockr.io instead of btc.blockr.io)

unconfirmed transactions were really left in unconfirmed state even thou they were then part of the real block.
We fixed this issue and rolled an update to live servers.
Thanks again,
