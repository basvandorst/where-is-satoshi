@_date: 2016-04-12 16:44:40
This is promising and trustful 
@_date: 2016-04-12 17:36:45

It's a malware called ransomware and Ransomware is a type of malware that restricts access to the infected computer system in some way, and demands that the user pay a ransom to the malware operators to remove the restriction. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 17:03:10
So what happened, any new info about this ?
@_date: 2016-04-12 17:12:53

You can try with circle, or coinbase
@_date: 2016-04-12 16:54:46

The code is active for 2 more hours. Until 11:00 PST.
I would advise you to use a different ip address too when you will make the transfer with the other paypal account.
@_date: 2016-04-12 16:55:12
Switch to another wallet, electrum or bitcore 
@_date: 2016-04-26 16:09:37
Nice, that is some decent amount.
Well the code is limited to one use per paypal account, so you cannot use it again with the same paypal account. That is why you get that Invalid Code message.
Maybe try with a friend's paypal account? Or family?
@_date: 2016-04-12 17:08:51
Why you think so, he made a point there
@_date: 2016-04-12 14:49:20

@_date: 2016-04-12 16:51:31

@_date: 2016-04-12 16:46:23
Try with localbitcoins 
@_date: 2016-04-12 17:11:55
There's nothing you can,  I feel sorry for you and hope you learned the lesson
@_date: 2016-04-12 17:10:29
