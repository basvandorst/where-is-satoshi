Awesome concept. Maybe you can carry this over to the EU? The guys at bitwala would probably be all over it if you could come to a licensing agreement of sorts. I would use this with each and every payment made via my phone.... for example, you can pay via app at ALDI, imagine topping up to the next tenner and get some shweet shweet coin every time...

Well, usually people leech, then go offline and that's it.
When they pay for their downloads, it's their right to do so.
I just want to increase the incentive to seed.
As for cost effectiveness, I dunno. Netflix just publishes the torrent and hosts them from a half dozen gigabit connections, I am guessing that 5 minutes later (someone math this plz) the whole pack is streamable with no lag. Especially if, say an episode costs 25c and each seeder gets 5c for each episode they seed. Then, Netflix switches off their seedboxes and reaps the benefits forever. I'm guessing it's more an issue for scalability. Streaming to 2 million people who are NOT synchronized to a single source can be hard to do, doing it via joystream is "just" an elegant load-balancing solution.
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:16:22
should also be able to eat magnet links and automatically "sell" torrents i am currently seeding at the price I am buying them for.
say I am downloading MOVIE.AVI for 5c/GB and I am seeding, I should automatically be selling that file for 5c/GB to whoever happens to be connected to me.
Also, for legal applications, a rights owner should be able to sign a designated hardwired payment address into the contract. Say HBO wants to release all 5 seasons of GoT in HD for, say 25c/episode, everybody should automatically pay to THEM instead of the seeder (maybe HBO might want to pay forward a portion of this to seeders, as well?). this could actually be THE killer app when distributing High Quality Digital Content.

+considering your long standing involvement in some of the finest ventures of bitcoinland (paymium, coinapult, satoshidice) and your (assumedly) larger-than-average bitcoin holdings - wouldn't it tempt you to jump in as an angel investor and buy up, say, 51% of gox for half their debt and go oversee / run the joint as CEO?  (This number assumes that they're out ~200kBTC at 160$).
There are few people better suited who have both the means (btc) and the experience. 
I have 5000€ and 31BTC stuck in there, and I expect to never see them again (or in more than a year, if the bitcoin-24.com incident is any indication). However, with a figure like you at the helm, I'd feel vastly more confident.

I have no way of knowing which is true, probably both. I'm only inferring from my experience as trader and am offering one possible explanation.  
Side note: I also interpret falling exchange rates as a possible result of increasing merchant acceptance: the more customers use Bitcoin, the more payment processors appear as sellers on the markets. The reduced average volatility of the last months seems to support this notion. Again, only a theory.

That is if you believe OPs list.  
Still, I expect the price to be significantly over market, since all competing bidder would have to buy the coins outside of auction (ie @ market) if their bid wouldn't hit, so they will have accounted / modeled their bid according to a scenarion where all bidders buy a collective 30k coins @ market.  
That's all I'm saying.

Right now, we need to make as many people aware of the importance of the ECJ case and the downside if the Court rules (probably in 1 to 2 years time) that some or all Bitcoin activities are NOT exempt from VAT. Only governments can ‘intervene’ (make representations to the ECJ) in this type of case. So everyone should lobby for their tax authority to treat:
- virtual currencies ‘like money’ (i.e. people use it as a means of payment, like money) and so should not, of itself, be subject to VAT;
- virtual currency exchange activities as exempt under article 135 (1) of the EU VAT Directive.

prisoners dilemma.  
a multitude of entities are competing for the same 30000 coins. if you accept that the combined buying power of bids exceeds the number of coins available at a certain price point on the free market, you have to overbid. also, you cannot know how many bidders place how many bids (ie could be that four bidders bid for more than two blocks!).
you more than likely not get your coins at market, but at a substantial mark-up (depending also on the kind auf auction).

My comment got eaten by my mobile connection. So again, I am only offering one possible way to achieve profit, inferring from my experience as a trader. Probably, both are true. Also, in addition, two more ways to handle this which are usus in trading:
1) providing liquidity for a reduced fee percentage. Let's say you promise to always have 50BTC within 1% of the ask price, and in exchange you get a reduced trading fee. 
2) vwapping. BitPay knows it usually turns around 200BTC per day. So they program their sell bot to sell 100BTC per day at the bid price, essentially getting top-of-the-book price while merchants pay slippage.
Caveat: all numbers are pulled out of a hat, but the principles very much apply.

you are moving the goal posts. while i do not yet have made up my mind if i want to be a "corer" or a "classicer", i must agree that "use as advertised" is superficially only possible through low-latency (ie quick-confirming) cheap (ie 0-fee) transactions. 
as a merchant, it is inconvenient to have transactions stuck in limbo just because someone didnt bother to include a fee or a mine decides to only mine 1-trx-blocks (looking at you, antminer) that delay the payment process.  
It's a conundrum:
Miners should be mining to make a profit. For now, this is block reward. Soon, this SHOULD be trx fees. An almost fee-less payment system is potentially dangerous for miners as it narrows margins.  
Users want to use the network to transmit payments. As of right now, this is POTENTIALLY free. For smallish amounts (micropayments), a system that relies on fees is simply not feasible (advantage Sidechains, SegWit and what-have-you will solve this problem in the mediate future without having to rely on larger blocks. However, since moste of these approaches bundle trxs, the fee market will not grow in the same manner as the trx volume will.  
Now, and this is where I am thinking currently, the core team wants the "market" to sort it out. However, they are "burdening" this market on the public, where just as easily they could burden the market on the miners - simply quit mining when its not profitable any more! Whenever two parties collude against the public, I am (to say the least) weary.  
Add to the mix the rampant censorship on r/bitcoin, and you might just have me convinced that there might be an agenda. But thats tinfoil-hatting, let's stick to the facts.

however, even a 5c trx-fee is prohibitive for micro transactions (the proverbial coffee, for example). thus, at the moment, under the given circumstances, bitcoin is not economically sound to be used in this manner. one CAN ARGUE that this makes it much UNLIKE a currency such as cash.

I'm not sure why, but I think any discussion of excessve fees/conf-time seems to get dragged down into the BU/Core swamp that are throwing at each other without care for sensible discussion.  
I'll tell you what.  
I am a bitcoin-only merchant. I move several 100k each month. At times, 8 out of 10 transactions to my store are delayed significantly (meaning: more than 6 blocks for the first confirmation, one transaction spent more than 10 days in mempool). This places a significant burden of risk on me, which is unacceptable. It is not "the network" or "the system" that is broken, but the inability of many parties to adapt quickly (disclosure: I am pro-SegWit, so I guess I'll put most blame on those proposing BU, but that's a personal opinion and will not affect this post, where I try to be as neutral as possible).
The perspective you dear people are arguing from is that of a tech-insider. None of *you* can claim (and neither can I) that you are not aware of the importance of paying the appropriate fee at the appropriate time, following the circumstances (backlog in mempool, trx size etc).  
However, a normal *user* (and yes, there are those) might not be. Not everyone goes to a fee calculating site to approximate the right Satoshi/byte ratio. Many people rely on mobile or online wallets, exchanges even. Many of these applications still pay the standard fee of .0001BTC, which just doesn't cut it. Some users have set the fee to "low" (looking at you, indiesquarewallet), which cuts it even less.  The "high" setting in conjunction with a larger-than-usual transaction size led to a 2.50$ fee for 142$ payment. That also is slightly on the expensive side.
Now, these circumstances can be mitigated. There is a whole ecosystem of companies you can rely on to circumvent the restrictions users are facing when getting their transaction through. There is BitPay (shout out to them), who have so far honoured every single payment made to me, no matter how delayed. Ther is GAP600, who will insure 0-conf transactions for a flat fee. There is BitGo, offering a 2-of-3 "instant" payment between platforms that subscribe to BitGoInstant. All these services charge fees.  So now, in addition to the confusion about rising fees and transaction times, serious users can (must?) pay additional fees to alleviate the risk imposed upon them by users who are less aware.  
And herein lies the main point I am trying to make.  
The system is not "fine" just because you can send 5 BTC to your buddy and it just takes 3 blocks to conf instead of 1 because you are consciously aware of all the steps necessary to keep your transaction from getting stuck in mempool forever. The system is not "fine" if a merchant that deals in IRL goods cannot accept a payment if he runs risk of 20% or more in BTCUSD volatility and is supposed to carry that risk for several days.  The system is also not "fine" if wallets and exchanges are unaware of or ignore methods of determining an adequate trx fee. The system is not "fine" if much-needed second-layer apps such as XCP (which acts as gateway for a whole branch of mobile gaming) can't trade tokens because the fees surpass the value of a token by far (see also: STORJ abandons XCP and moves to ETH). The system is not "fine" if merchants or payment processors are forced to buy insurance or subscribe to 3rd-party transaction services to move their coins quickly. The system is not "fine" if I cannot send 150$ without spending 2% in fees.  
And there are those who shrug this off and say "No, actually this is fine."  And I resent that. I am not sure if this attitude simply discounts all those that reside outside of our enlightened circles, or operates under the assumption that the "real world" should have no bearing on us, or that nubs who can't calculate their own trx fees shouldn't deal with bitcoin anyways, or that bitcoin isn't made for micropayments anyways, or that 2nd-layer-apps sich as XCP are evil, or... whatever, there are several others...?   
I am sure, however, that this attitude seriously harms bitcoin and (amongst other things) delays the activation of much-needed features such as SegWit, LN and others.

exactly my experience (as posted [here]( but that got buried).
It's not all about us, who know what we're doing, but about usability for the public. That's the point where I 100% agree with Roger Ver, although he's not drawing the right conclusions, imho.

He is accepting Bitcoin via Bitpay.
So while it should be "Pay with Bitcoin", the current label of the button is not technically incorrect.
It should be noted that it's totally irrelevant to us if he keeps the coins (which bitpay does support), cashes out instantly in USD (or any other of a multitude of currencies) or splits the payout percentage-wise between btc and fiat (which bitpay also supports).
So please stop bickering about this technicality.

thus the pool can include the trx AND the payment trx at the same time, making sure they receive the payment as well.

this thing is actually the swedish ETN, the good news is that germans can now trade it as well.
simply put, an ETF is (ideally) a representation of an asset that is phyiscally available. a SP500 ETF (ideally) owns a bunch of shares of all the stocks in the SP500 to "back" their ETF,  so you actually "own" a piece of each company's stock hrough the ETF. all these stocks are kept seperate from the issuer's assets, so when the issuer goes belly-up, your ETF is still worth its "content".
these ETFs can also be swap-based or synthetic (ie you only have a piece of paper that represents some conglomerate of financial instruments that are supposed to mirror the performance of the S&amp;P500). most of these incur some kind od "issuer risk", ie when the financial instruments are taken off the market, you might incur a loss.
an ETN is a "note" (a certificate) which is basically "this piece of paper is mirroring the price of the S&amp;P500", with little to no security for you should the issuer go broke. 
IANAL, read the product prospectus for more insight.

* goto bitaddress.org
* save the file as .html (or get it from [github](
* disconnect from the net
* reboot computer
* load the html in your browser
* select the "brain wallet" tab
* type a sentence that you will ALWAYS be able to remember
* save the Address (not the private key!) to a text file
* reboot comp
* connect to net
* send BTC to the address
For example, the phrase  *"my brothers middle inital is J"* will be transformed into a bitcoin adress, in this case: **1zszqLE7SL6bMgZBfcNTric3enuY63QXB** and a private key: **5K8haCu45NECti86q7syRWnErHogxTBpTP72JoabLUa5QQL4pZE**.
If you send the BTC to the Address and remember the passphrase, you will be able to recreate that private key (I have taken the liberty of hosting a copy of bitaddress.org at my own webspace and saved a couple of instances on the diverse backp media i keep around).
Now i a couple of years, you will want to get the BTC at that address to spend on ~~hookers~~ milk.
* load the html
* type your passphrase
* import the private key to your wallet of choice
* voila! the btc are yours to spend.

I run bitcoincommodities.com. While it's true that I trade of my own stock, I do have many more items at hand (read: in a vault at the bank).
However, in the year+ or so I've done this (started out with a wordpress site) I found out that the same half dozen or so items were what was bought all the time:
- austrian harmonies / maples / eagles
- small silver bars
- bitcoin coins (only store to still carry the series "A" coin!)
- 1g gold bars
- 1g gold coins.
so I concentrate on that, which results in lower prices overall and made it easier to restock.
No sense in listing that 1967 Krugerrand at collectors's price when all people want is generic coins and bars to keep for their value, right?
The store front is a stock osCommerce cart, haven't gotten around to editing the template (doubt I will, too).

When I started accepting bitcoin, it was based on the thought of giving people who had BTC an outlet for those, to actually SPEND them. This has worked rather well, I'm turning millions of Euros. With that in thought, there should be a couple of people holding some of the alts as well, and what are they doing with them beside speculate?  not much, I am guessing.
So in order to give them something to  buy with these coins, I decided to accept some alts as well, the response to which was... whelming.  That might be because I am incurring sizeable friction losses (bitpayments-&gt;cryptsy-&gt;BTC-&gt;BitPay) so I charge 5% on top with altcoins. So I am asking others  -  do you accept alts? How does this work for you? How do you make it work? Do you convert? If so, where? How fast?

this is gonna coste me some karma, but as a merchant my answer is: no.jpg
my prices adjust by the minute, and whenever the price makes a major upward movement, I get swamped with orders, leaving mit with a substantial immanent downside risk.
* buying what I sell with Bitcoin is worth the extra 3% due to anonymity reasons
* people need an outlet for their bitcoin, willing to pay a premium over going through the hassle to exchange to fiat, then buy locally
* you want me to speculate on BTC to give you 5% while I need to restock with fiat?
* buying stuff from me with your $8 BTC and still haggling about 2% to add to your effectively 75% discount? maybe you should get a job.
I had my own checkout/payment solution written, cost me 200€, so no fee for me (used paysius before that at 0.5%). Lowered my prices by that amount.

Should be like this:  
If the last block was smaller than maxsize (1MB) and there were unconfirmed transactions left over (which means that the miner disregards transactions that pay less than X in transaction fees), the network wide transaction fee should be set at half the previous trx fee,  minimum 0.0000001.
Only and ONLY if the blocks reach 1MB should the transaction fee be raised up to the point until there are unconfirmed transactions parallel to a block that  is &lt; 1MB.

Transactions fees incurred during the time it takes to find the next block are credited to the miner that finds said block. 
This is one of the incentives for miners to continue mining.

My response to their newsletter.
as much as I am looking forward to seeing process in the shipping department, I would like to voice a my opinion on your handling of the shipping delay in regards to pricing.
the batch 3 units were priced with a certain ROI expection in thought. 
of course, that expection is not in any way feasible right now.
would it be too much to ask to backwards-re-adjust the price of the units?
it probably would not even have to represent the true expectional ROI.
most customers would probably accept a refund in the 20% or 25% range, given that batch 3 users only will have a week or two before the custom-built boards with avalon chips start to go live.
you're all engineers, you can do the math.

Bitcoin exchanges are the purest form of market there is.  
Since bitcoins do not inherently represent anything (such as, you know, a barrel of oil, a side of lean hog, a bushel of wheat, an ounce of metal), the price of bitcoin is dictated only supply, demand and their potential utility (usability).

I've seen these yesterday (Carsten was nice enough to drop by at Room77 for the Berlin meetup), they looked very good "IRL".
Many people said that these are basically cheque-card-casascius', but they're more:
- you can instacheck the balance via the left QR
- you can upload more via the right QR
- they're less expensive (seen a 1.05BTC Casascius? Me neither)
What with the latest German decisions about BTC taxation, one could get one of these cards for every month and dedicate all dividends or miners towards it to maintain the speculation-deadline of one year.

That's the problem.
Each Little piece of BTC is treated as one Input, and there needs to be a fee paid for each input. So paying 0.000005 fee when there are 20 inputs of, say 0.0000001 each, is useless.

I've long been of the opinion that the path of that salad-tossing, self-empowering, self-interest-serving "Foundation" towards Washington was what might be able to bring a slow, regulation-choked death to bitcoin.
Boy was I ever wrong!
The Foundation, if they support this in any which way, is actually bringing a quick, traiterous, back-stabbing death to all ideals, hopes and high goals that millions, billions (!) of people could have lived up and through bitcoin.
Thanks for nothing, ass-wads.
The "Foundation" needs to make it crystal clear that such measures of censorship are DIRECTLY contradictory to freedom of transaction, which is one of the main properties of the bitcoin network.
Should I be able to maintain any respect for any of the boards' members, they would have to leave the foundation TODAY and renounce the implementation of these principles.
