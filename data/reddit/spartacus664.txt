Losing 80% of your holding value, tells me your clueless.
@_date: 2018-09-09 20:56:36
Absolute crap, it’s slow and inefficient, there is no Bitcoin under supply, this is why the price is low, and if you can’t work out that when the price is low, it means it’s all a great big lie about adoption, then there is no helping you.
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:01:07
Yep hodling props the price up, the killer is though it makes retail adoption virtually impossible and makes it pointless as a currency, nobody spends today what will be worth more tomorrow.

The point still is, if you gave me vested power I’d break bitcoins back within 6 months, as long as I had all the backing from all the nations world wide.
But I could still break it locally through heavy sentencing, and making sure I followed through every time on every individual.
I assure anyone, anyone or any movement can be broken.

There is no way to measure the value of bitcoins, if just one small piece of news can send it’s price crashing by a 1000 dollars, no one can know its true value.
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:05:08
Bitcoin is the most stupid investment an institutional trader could get involved with, it’s got little true value.
When you have price drops based on speculative news, it even more stupid than the price rises from speculative trading.
Either way it’s a market that’s completely devoid of any real substance.
I’d lay a bet that Bakkt won’t have that much effect on bitcoin, because I don’t see that interest from investors.
Any one who’s thrown a few million onto bitcoin over the last week, had now incurred big losses.

Yep just checked the price and we are tanking down again hahaha, bitcoins so manipulated it’s a joke.
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:15:44
Well firstly my comment is based on what I’ve already read, and digibyte is faster which is a bonus.
I know all about the satoshi, divisibility ect , and the potential for micro satoshi.
So you’re saying digibyte tokens aren’t divisible and there will only be 21 billion.
I base my observations on supply and demand metrics, they seldom lie.
Any oversupply will decrease value if the demand is also low, it’s one thing people into Bitcoins generally don’t understand, they seem to struggle with price correlation to the supply and demand model.
@_date: 2018-09-02 23:10:40

@_date: 2018-09-05 08:08:10
It’s not that difficult to kill if you want to kill it, all a government or more to the point governments  would have to do is outlaw it.
Meaning anyone traced using it would serve a mandatory jail sentence, say 10 years without parole.
Because the public are in general law abiding and don’t want to ever see a prison cell, the market would implode, and for all those hardliners there is the Blockchain to examine to find people using it.
If also you’re stopped from converting it into fiat, also this will kill it slowly.
Ban shops and merchant places from accepting those payments.
Make it LAW, and in force  that law with iron fist, Bitcoin would die, and the price would be zero fast.
@_date: 2018-09-10 06:05:34
Let us use ours haha, you don’t use it you store it that’s one of the reasons it’s doomed, the statements true, you can’t have real adoption and no price rise.
They only mine so many BTC per year, 12 every ten minutes, well dumbass do the maths, if people were buying 12 every ten minutes globally there’d be supply issue, hence higher prices, you can surely conclude that’s not happening.
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:51:20
Is this meant to be exciting, I can’t really see anything in it, buying a failing exchange that had huge debt.
@_date: 2018-09-05 12:28:53
Don’t say it would never happen, if the G20 agree bitcoin is dead, don’t think that these things can’t happen, unlikely but if they wanted to they could.
Saying no one can stop bitcoin is silly, whether it’s decentralised or not it relies on growth like a cancer tumour, kill the host or cut of the blood supply metaphorically speaking and it dies.
I would relish the challenge from someone who said I can’t stop it, it would motivate me more to crush it into oblivion.
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:47:10
I’m not convinced consumption isn’t unnecessary, it’s that consumption that keeps those wheels turning, If you’re a shop owner or business you rely on people spending and not saving this is why governments set an inflation target.
You have to pour money into an economy sometimes so that you can stave of problems for your people, ironically this can have effects on that economy but probably not as bad as the effects of doing nothing.
In BItcoin world it’s simplified, we have a fixed supply no more lender of last resort (no help no matter what) and each government authority and individual must not or cannot overspend, sounds great right?
Problem is that’s not how it works and history proves this.

Hahahaha forex trader �� I’m laughing.
I repeat bitcoin is nowhere on a global scale, if you can show me direct data proving it is, I will be stop whining, ahhhh but you “CANT” , so shut up.
And bitcoin isn’t complicated to me I’ve known about BTC for along time, I said it’s complicated for the general populous, that’s why it’s hassle for others to  copy, scan, type in a public key so they can make a payment, or on the other hand they can just type in a 4 digit code from a debit card, and that debit card is accepted globally.
Do you really think you could make a weaker statement than the one you have, *don’t worry Bitcoins becoming less complicated day by day, * I’m not worried I have a debit card so I don’t care about bitcoin or how complicated it is, I’m insulated from that complicated crap and it’s weaknesses also.

It’s not good banks laundering money, but do we really need to add to that via crypto, I think that’s silly.

Oh that’s easy to explain, I realised a long time ago that most people who are into bitcoin are weak, and have weak arguments, they don’t like the truth, they deny the truth, so I’m here to point them in the right direction.
Reddit is a free site, so my view is also allowed.
Oh and I’m not anti any other thing like your trying to say, we weren’t talking about anything other than BTC, stick to the topic.
@_date: 2018-09-04 00:52:09
Pre paid cards ummmm and “HODLING” come on enough of the bullshit, people buy BTC and they don’t spend it, or the majority don’t, YOU CANT HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.
Scaling is being worked upon but it’s not everywhere, and even if it was BTC isn’t used, 200,000 place he said BTC is accepted and this is global, it’s a “JOKE RIGHT”.
Saying BTC doesn’t have any use is a bit strong, but it’s not spreading like it should, NAKAMOTO said within 10 years it will either be everywhere or “NO WHERE” the latter considering the size of earth is more pertinent as we speak today.
Loading cards and all that stuff is hassle, I don’t have to load a debit card.
What gives here ultimately is crypto is complicated and hassle that people don’t want, they want easy.
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:12:01
You don’t understand supply and demand and it’s correlation to price clearly, that’s fine most people into BTC are retarded when it comes to working out how it has value anyway.
But if you say something’s, times 6 from last January that doesn’t say a lot about a ever expanding adoption rate, it’s truly pathetic, you just don’t understand supply and demand.
There is no real value at all it’s based on future news, on the hope some institutional investors will save it, other than that it’s a pump and dump, Pyramid scheme, visa and MasterCard are laughing at how inefficient it is as a payment system.
No one wants it, and even with so called low prices only fools are buying it, no one else in the world cares.

One BTC will end up like it was in 2009 = 0 = 1BTC do you understand.
As we all know BItcoin on its own is worthless, only has value because of its links to fiat, people don’t want BTC they want the fiat profit linkage from it.
Tell you what when they go to ZERO you can have them all, and pretend 1BTC = 1BTC ���� oh yes with no value.

Are you insane, volatility decreasing hahaha ������, bitcoin lost $500 dollars in around 2 hours yesterday.
You won’t tame BTC volatility while you have whales who own more than 40% of the market, those whales can influence the price anytime they like, and more so if it’s a coordinated pump or dump.
Bitcoins would need to be worth around 300 thousand US dollars each before you saw the same kind of stability, stable fiat currencies have, this is the kind of liquidity needed.
And because all BItcoin is is a pump and dump Pyramid scheme, there is absolutely no chance Bitcoins will ever get that high, because someone will burst the bubble before it gets there, and this whole house of cards bubble will start again, over and over until so many people lose faith and it collapses down to zero.
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:40:01
That guys talking crap, economies don’t work in basic terms like a lot of people with libertarians views on economics think they do.
Your friend is correct and the facts are a deflationary currency can’t work as a global currency, it’s fixed supply would screw an ever expanding population if that fixed supply’s value didn’t keep constantly rising, it is possible for it to keep rising, but the balance would be so fine, any lack of funds in the global economy or crashes of the BTC price would be more devastating than the periodic crashes we have now.
Holdling and spending are a contradiction in terms, you can’t do both, fiat doesn’t work or isn’t perfect, but neither is BTC and it’s truly not a cure, people are absorbed in something different, once your’e absorbed you become blinkered and ignore the faults.
You won’t ever get the whole world economy and all those countries to agree or accept, it’s pipe dreams.
If everyone stops spending in the economy no matter what country you’re from the wheels that turn those cogs seize up, and this is devastating to jobs and wealth.
You can’t run an economy on a deflationary currency, there are to many variables.
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:57:43
Because bitcoins are designed to be divisible by 100 million places, the answer to your question is NO it’s not too late.
Basically if you have 5 dollars worth of bitcoin, the amount of bitcoin won’t change unless you buy more, what will likely change is the price In an upward direction over time, this is because they are deflationary and not inflationary, the latter inflation erodes wealth thus making your purchasing power less, meaning each year normal fiat currency buys you less in the shops.
It is way more complex than the above inna working economics, you should follow your heart, there is money to be made from bitcoins, but it has faults that are plain to see, maybe they can be worked out maybe not.
Owning a whole Bitcoin is irrelevant but also a challenge, go for it if your happy and can offset some money for it.
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:58:08
Let me give you an example, let’s take a halvening event, some people think that if the reward is halved say from “12 Bitcoin down to 6”, that the price per coin should double.
Where in reality if demand is decreasing there may even be a drop in price, for the price to rise there has to be more demand that supply, and that equilibrium  works both ways.
So for these reasons mathematically bitcoins should if demand is there be worth more than an oversupplied coin.
I’m not convinced via anything I’ve seen lately that even BTC demand is out stripping supply via real person buying in adoption, I don’t care what anyone says the price would be rising, and it’s not to a noticeable degree.
@_date: 2018-08-28 05:01:47
No they are meant to grow with the population, you’re talking utter rubbish, you have no understanding of economics if you did you’d realise that a growing word population needs also a growing money supply.
If you have a deflationary currency, central banks cannot create extra liquidity in times of need, also they cannot directly step in and help their import and export business with devaluation of their currency which helps people and economies prosper.
You are clueless in the highest degree, next you’ll be saying the global economy will or is going to collapse ��������������������������������������.

Bitcoin needs the “FUTURE”, problem is we live in the present and public sentiment is such that bitcoin is not wanted above traditional payment methods.
You only have to read the comments on here.
FACT 95% of the population would rather work under centralisation, do the math and you realise BTC adoption is only about 
.01%, you’ll all probably be saying it’s early days yet 20 years from now.

Look at Russia they don’t take crap, you either do it or suffer the consequences.
All of what I gave as examples would kill bitcoins value.
Here’s a big joke in bitcoin, because I own bitcoins they can’t touch me, fine I will confiscate your house and property for a forced sale, by all means keep your bitcoins, but we’ll monitor you until you either cash them out or spend them, then we’ll seize your assets again.

So where are you going now ��.
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:42:33
The examples you gave were YUP guess work, and even if someone gave you a figure of 35 million, that’s not worth anyone’s time, it will fizzle out gradually, bubble up bubble down, bubble up bubble down, bubble up if your lucky, down to zero, end game.
The latter is pretty much how BTC will die.
Slow yes, no one cares about how much shitcoin one can send via wallets, as the recipient can’t spend that BTC as no one accepts it, like all the bullshit makes out they can, they still have to change it into fiat, it doesn’t work.
Waiting 5 minutes in a shop for a confirmation is slow.
My debit card is faster and insured.
Added privacy of ways for people to avoid tax or ways that will increase money laundering will also be another nail in the BTC coffin, governments will strangle it with regulation, I can’t wait to laugh at that strangulation, even morons like yourself can surely see they won’t allow ways for people to cheat the system.
*LN* please stop bleeting on about that, I’ve not seen one place advertising lightning payments, and considering most people (99.9%) of the population have voted not to buy BTC or use or hold it, then thats also irrelevant.
And am I meant to be impressed that you trade shit coins?
I’m NOT, neither do I care for people who brag about me me me.
The rest of us who get it ��, yes right that tiny amount again, one day your brain will understand (maybe ����).
There are fools who cry the global economy will collapse, and there are fools who think Bitcoins can change the world, most people just aren’t sure which group to laugh at the most.
@_date: 2018-08-31 00:00:55
Speculative trading isn’t on chain, the chain can’t handle that transaction volume, where is it saying these are on chain transactions?
I’m not misleading anyone, there are very few transactions used in retail ect, because BTC is tiny and 99.9% of places worldwide don’t accept it as a payment.
If you break the above down you’ll clearly see this must be off chain transactions, either way it’s speculation, trading bots ect, NOT REAL WORLD USE.
And I’m on here because I have the right, same as I have the right to lobby the European Parliament or other, to have cross border payments put under money laundering laws, which would eliminate one of bitcoins so called benefits.
I could lobby them and get the law changed  so anyone caught transferring wealth across borders without declaring it would be imprisoned, as under international law ML is illegal.

There are 31million people in Venezuela, yes that’s 31 million.
I’ve just done some research and its from an exchange related to bitcoin in Venezuela, and it stated about 85,000 people have found use for BTC�� !.
Not only that but after purchasing they’ve changed it into USD as fast as possible as to defy BTC volatility.

Speculative trading at the end says it all, this doesn’t show any adoption, just trades executed each second.
TX volumes are so misleading.
@_date: 2018-08-28 00:14:56
It’s based on trading, how can anyone say that the 10% that isn’t based upon trading is promising, 10% is nothing.
Go on another post and you’ll see people asking where can I spend BTC, are you getting the point yet, it’s not a payment system that the public are interested in over traditional ones.
There isn’t adoption, just trading buy and sell TX data, which in this case is used to make BTC look like it’s somewhere, When actually it’s nowhere.
@_date: 2018-08-29 01:28:24
So answer the question kid, how are you assigning real value to BTC, I work in the city of London and have for 30 years i’m waiting, if you’ve majored in economics you’d know it has no value.
Prove me wrong or shut up!
You see “LITTLE MAN “you’ve not got the answers.
You should read this, Jordon Belfort used to run his own brokerage firm he’s up the investing scale compared to you, as I am too.

The bitcoin price does not follow hash-rate, you can have more miners and a higher hashrate, but still have the same amount of BTC holders and the same BTC price.
The algorithm only adjusts anyway, even if you throw more and more at mining BTC, it makes the network more secure for sure but it doesn’t not increase price.
New people buying in will increase the price, through supply and demand, then the price itself will become the main factor for more people buying in (FOMO).
Price = adoption
Adoption= price
Everything else without new customers buying in, is manipulation.
Even halvening events won’t push prices up unless the demand is higher than supply.

You can’t answer because you’re a moron who tries like most on here to make out they understand bitcoin and economics, yet when a simple answer is required they don’t know it.
You see most people who invest in BTC do so through *greater fool theory*! it means you’re waiting for a bigger moron to buy at a higher price.
Why we call it greater fool is because BTC produces no value, value isn’t being immutable, censorship resistant and all the other techno babble, that isn’t true value.
So how is it getting this value, like I’ve pointed out increased hashing power doesn’t effect upward price, miners are gambling the price will rise nothing more.
I’ve pointed out BTC likely will go down rather than up long term because it’s flawed in every way.
It can’t scale, it’s slow, it’s corrupted via bad players ect.., I could go on.
But considering your so cleaver yet can’t even answer basic questions, then already I know you’re an investor that doesn’t know how value is assigned.
That makes you really stupid.
@_date: 2018-08-30 10:22:00
Do you realise how much liquidity the bitcoin market would need for a stable price?
And if you do, you’ll know how much a bitcoin would have to be worth for that to happen?.
If you know both the above,and you know that real adoption isn’t happening NO1, and NO2 the last bubble collapsed at “20 thousand USD”, which is a tiny faction of how much a bitcoin would need to be worth, and finally NO3 most BTC aren’t used due to hodling.
How prey tell do you work out that it’s possible for a payment system to truly work?.
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:30:07
It’s irrelevant, selling BTC as secure, when it has NO real value is a pointless operation, that’s why I’ve already explained it’s not being adopted.
If it was” so wanted” because it’s secure the public would be all over it “THEY’RE NOT”, I’ve given  you the reasons also why they’re not (insurance).
If you don’t believe BTC isn’t being adopted look at the price, if you understand supply and demand, it’s soooo soooo clear.
So secure but pointless, more secure than my bank, but still pointless, I get your meaning.
@_date: 2018-08-29 01:57:15
It’s not, since it’s creation or since it was assigned value via people and only a small niche of people that price bubble has always lingered in one state or another.
For instance the height of the bubble crisis in BTC was bad, but it’s still a bubble now, as there isn’t no true value that’s assigned to it.
Once you remove the blinkers you see it’s clear manipulation of a market, literally nothing more, IT DOESN’T DO ANYTHING.
So like this other guy before you, who had no answers and was a fool of the highest magnitude, let me show you why BTC is manipulated and the Wild West of investing.
First remember it has NO value.
The value comes from manipulation.
We already have things in society that do what it proposes to do better, and clearly can’t as history has proved.
So it’s price gains and falls come from “High frequency BOT TRADING”, this is why BTC is a fool market and 90% will get raped of their money, the cleaver 10% will walk away with their money.
If you watch the BTC price you can see the pump, once they pump”greater fools” buy in through greed, then inevitably the market price crashes, and empty bag holders remain.
I assure you that BTC bubble prices will always collapse around 20 thousand USD, and those bubbles will kill BTC because in the end everyone will know it’s a pump pump pump, and dump.
This is why long term the miners and mining pools will collapse as interest wains and prices go to zero, and long before zero the networks security will be in jeopardy.
Don’t loose your hard earn’t money and see the light.
@_date: 2018-08-30 03:47:10
Think the guy means no one really uses it, that is and does make a massive difference, because the price must only be based on unstable speculation.
No so,SO but more like ��☹️ this isn’t good.
@_date: 2018-08-30 07:42:20
You’ve not in the whole of that sonnet, wrote anything with any proof or substance.
I’m laughing at how you don’t understand the basics of the BTC price, as price equals adoption through FOMO.
Nobody buy in unless they don’t want to miss out, and the more who buy push the price higher.
It’s “greater fool theory” FOMO is basically the same thing.
Anyway me and all the other people in the world are just going to transfer our billions or millions across border, then we’re going to Starbucks for a coffee and pay via visa ��.
@_date: 2018-08-30 06:39:03
No you’re wrong, because even if those transactions are off chain, those buy and sell orders or trades go to wallets.
The clue is the wallets, basically they know how many wallets have either been downloaded or sold, hence you know roundabout how many people use BTC.
Like in the states  60% of people have heard of BTC, oops only 5% transact in it.
I can show you data if you disagree?.
And you don’t understand adoption.
Adoption isn’t how a local shop has a device to accept BTC, adoption is the general populous buying into BTC.
So many people have this false adoption model in their minds, no one cares about the shops machine, if no one uses it, and for people to use it, more people need to buy in.
This is not happening, and I’ll challenge anyone world wide to prove this.
@_date: 2018-08-30 23:27:46
No you’re clearly not very good at reading, I didn’t ask you that, but while you’ve said that I can see that you’ve no understanding of true value.
Firstly being able to sent a payment across border isn’t productive value, it’s not value in anyway.
Look kid  I’ll answer the question for you, apart from speculation bitcoins can’t be used for anything other than speculation, they have no use other than that, they have no productive value.
You’re not the only idiot into bitcoins that doesn’t understand productive real values, and like I said you kinda ran for the door, tried escaping by spouting some andreas Antonopoulos bullshit.
So you’ll clearly see shitcoins do nothing.
What gives fiat value is the 8 billion people who transact in it each day, as apposed to the 17 million bitcoin holders, plus the dollar is backed via the most powerful government on earth, a government that has a consensus with 20 of the most powerful nations on earth, that’s not to mention the armies they have behind them, that will enforce any will they decide.
If they shut all BTC mining down, outlaw electric use for mining farms, make a mandatory life sentence for anyone caught interacting in bitcoin, or change the laws on counterfeiting so that BTC now falls under those laws, Bitcoins would fall to zero within hours.
You have faith in a tiny market, it’s so tiny nobody outside knows it exists, and they are voting that they don’t want bitcoins because they’re not buying them, don’t believe me?
Read supply and demand if not, or I can send you a link, but basically the BTC price would be constantly climbing if there was higher demand than supply.
ITS NOT.
How also are you working out butcoins are anonymous?
Any public address can be traced to a person with an identity, it’s called forensic analysis of the blockchain, all transactions lead back to a bank account a credit card or a debit card sooner or later, bitcoins have to be cashed out.
What you’re saying is complete crap, do you think the IRS are going to let everyone not pay tax?
Here is another one for all the dumb people, “CROSS BORDER PAYMENTS”, sooner or later foreign countries will start asking how your funds came into their country, usually by country law you have to declare any funds over a certain amount if you enter a country.
If you don’t declare those funds, that’s money laundering, and is an imprisonable crime.
Sorry but sooner or later they’ll regulate this and they’ll ask how your funds entered our country, how you’ve bought houses and are living this life style, bitcoins changed to fiat are easily found via bank accounts and changing houses that offer this service.
Regulation on bitcoin will be clamped like a vice at every level, just as it should be.
There are a lot of people crying daily because they’ve already lost fortunes on bitcoin investing, in the future they’ll be a lot more crying from a prison cell, because they thought they could break the law on a technology that offers false promises.
Let me add something else, you see decentralised systems are bull shit, here’s why.
What happens when your bank account is frozen via your bank?��
You go like everyone else to the police, and what are the police?, they’re a “centralised authority”, you say please mr police man can you get my money back?.
Can’t you clearly use your intelligence and see these fuck wit libertarians only want decentralised systems when they want, but not when things go wrong?,
I use BTC because I’m free and anonymous, yet then you’ll go on your social media account and of course you have a social security number, being “NO ONE” isn’t freedom, it’s restricting your already hard life, by making things harder.
Bitcoins and Bitcoin and decentralised systems is BULLSHIT, just the nerds haven’t worked the hypocrisy out yet.
@_date: 2018-08-30 15:35:58
Yep I know that feeling, it’s like when you ask someone who owns bitcoins how they have value.
1) first they gulp and look at you as if you’re the devil, next they make excuses like, it’s immutable, decentralised, censorship resistant ect, then you point out that not productive value.
2) geez the poor guys sweating now, finger him a little more, oh he exclaims it’s worth money because it uses electricity, then you point out that’s labour theory economics and laughable.
3) he’s really struggling now, oh shit he’s bolting for the door, wait wait you shout come back we’ve not finished yet, fuck you he says you can’t ask bitcoiners questions like that.
Problem with this story is it’s true, and I see it all the time.
Funny though watching them sweat ��.

Oh you mean voodoo, witchcraft,  could you be more specific or would you have some data, involving price rises.

@_date: 2018-08-29 11:30:37
“Believer”, I used to think it was special, but I’ve torn it apart and I can’t see how it is, nakamoto claimed SPV wallets were enough to scale higher or to the level of visa, others though not hence “LN”, it doesn’t work as a payment system because it’s slow (really slow).
Storing BTC is hassle to anyone who isn’t a true advocate, there is no insurance and people aren’t comfy, I could go on but there are so many flaws I can’t be bothered.
I admit forex investors and others lose yes, but those brokerages are regulated, decentralised systems are way to difficult to regulate because there are no borders, a butterfly flaps its wings and causes a hurricane on another continent scenario, hence why ETF,s aren’t being granted as you cant control a decentralised market.
I live in the West I can’t see my government taking my money, I don’t buy all the doom and gloom, the US is going bankrupt, I meet people on here that when questioned they think quantitative easing is money devaluation, when you and I know this isn’t the effect from QE, I believe BTC can’t be a currency because you can’t devalue it, you’ll also understand the power of devaluing your currency to make your import and export business competitive, these things are not possible with BTC,
I understand your take on it, and I can see it suits you, but you’re in a select club, most aren’t.
@_date: 2018-08-30 04:37:38
Either way it’s not adoption, you show me data now, which clearly shows those TX are going through shops and that it’s used by the public?.
You can’t, and here is why, supply and demand laws would mean if this was the case, the BTC supply wasn’t outstripping demand, hence the price would be way higher.
It’s not, I can tell all via supply and demand and the BTC price.
And I’ll challenge anyone on earth to prove me wrong.
The whole idea that BTC TX can all be on chain and have that security is a joke, this is yet another of BTCs bullshit myths at what 7 transaction per second ��.

Dude looked at me said “not so good?, I said why, dude said I’ve had one customer in 8 months ��.
Oh I said let me think��, so if the BTC machine isn’t getting used does that mean people aren’t interested?.
Yes dude replied , oh I said and because they’re not interested does that mean they’re not buying bitcoins to use in the machine?

@_date: 2018-08-31 10:39:09
Read between the lines, how’s mcafee working out we’ve had this adoption while the price has stayed static, in fact the price has dropped.
It’s just a contradiction or how market prices grow.
So by saying adoption has increased via supply and demand laws, if demand increases and supply stays the same, the higher demand leads to a higher equilibrium price and visa versa.
BTC is mined at a set rate, so there is no over supply, just a steady block reward every 10 minutes.
That means prices should rise with adoption of people buying into BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-29 09:34:16
We will see when  that institutional desk opens, my opinion is there won’t be the demand people are predicting, I don’t hear anyone saying BTC even in private.
There have been many hedge fund managers openly state their clients interest is zero.
I will come back to you in November, that’s when we’ll see, making money early in is easy as you have, calling a market is way harder as you know, if the BTC price goes 25k USD in a short time frame I’ll sit up and listen, I have a sneaking feeling it’s over played yet again.
@_date: 2018-08-29 06:54:34
No your not curious because you’re  a bitcoiner, bitcoiners don’t like the truth as they believe there own hype, when they never see the truth.
Bitcoins have no value, they produce nothing, their value is based of dirty trading tactics. 
But please read.
If I taxed BTC trading by 50% tomorrow BTC would die within a week, because its price is manipulation, you work what I’ve said out.
@_date: 2018-08-29 08:35:02

And be curious it will do you good.
@_date: 2018-08-27 23:16:25
This is interesting reading mostly because it’s shocking to think, how value is being assigned to crypto currency.
There clearly is no productive value, what does BTC produce that gives it value, other than others buying in through more waves of speculation.
Dumping BTC at the top of the bubble and buying back at a fraction of the cost can make you rich, sooner or later though the lights will come on for people who believe in this *thing* and they’ll start and understand what productive value means, when they’ve lost the lot in the biggest scam in history.
@_date: 2018-08-29 10:49:47
Don’t get me confused please, I mean sit up and listen because, I’d see more value from it if institutional money is investing, I don’t see any real value at present, I only see manipulation of the market.
But yes I agree because I know that 20k xmas price was tether printing and manipulation, I don’t deny there was adoption which is great and real value.
My theory is based on psychology, let me explain, I see BTC market as a pump and dump, let for now forget supposed use cases, once a bubble bursts late investors get burned this is fact and you’ll agree, the only way those investor make a gain is to weather the storm and hope the price goes up.
Nakamoto flaw IMO is FOMO, he clearly states FOMO ultimately is what will propel BTC in the end, as price equals adoption and not adoption equals price, the problem is how high can the price go before the bubble bursts, it reached 20K, people got burned, bad news travels fast.
How many bubbles can that marked sustain before too many investors lose and there is public out cry, and each bubble will burst and each time the whole BTC thing will be harmed, leaving less and less people willing to adopt.
(Fear of losing your money is more powerful than FOMO).
So I’d bet BTC price can’t ever reach a point of terminal velocity, where the markets propel its price, because that faith won’t come.
You may think I’m crazy but I don’t believe I am.
I new about BTC in 2012, I’m invested in BTC, I’m not a believer, I used to be but not no more.
@_date: 2018-08-30 07:13:06
Wrong, BTC produces nothing, it only has value because of speculation.
Wrong exchanges aren’t safe, they’re hacked a lot, to suggest otherwise is scraping the barrel.
Read the above, once you understand supply and demand, you’ll question how can the BTC price be so low.
Merchant has a machine and no one uses it, that’s adoption ummmm��, if that’s your take you’re lying to yourself.
@_date: 2018-08-29 07:16:13
Yep he’s a scammer, but there are many others like his that assign no value to bitcoin, because it has no value.

@_date: 2018-08-31 06:26:10
Do you have the data to confirm your suggestions, I think not, do you understand supply and demand and it’s real action to price?
NO YOU DON’T, if you did you’d know that more people buying in makes the price rise because that’s demand, which depletes supply.
The above isn’t hard, so when someone tells you everyone buying BTC, check the price if it’s not climbing it’s not happening.
Is it climbing?
Troll hahaha, what you’re a troll because you either tell the truth, or can see the truth ��.
@_date: 2018-08-30 14:07:14
You’re best selling your coins before this, because if it’s rejected it will send the price tanking down to $3000 or minus that amount.
Once faith goes price goes.
@_date: 2018-08-29 08:46:45
I must disagree as I see its false adoption, there isn’t movement in people adoption, you only have to look at the price.
You’ll know as well as I do that real value comes from usage via public adoption, people buy in the price moves higher via supply and demand metrics, I can’t see this, neither can any of my colleagues, if BTC was doing that I may buy in, just for those gains.
Tim drapers view is based on money velocity, I agree in principle, but either way you don’t have full velocity without adoption, also that’s banking on the banks replacing swift and payment networks moving to BTC, I’m not convinced.
Also that added money velocity can cause other issues like inflation, I’m not convinced, if Tim Draper believes in BTC so much, then why doesn’t Paypal implement it as everyone say now is BTC,s time?.
@_date: 2018-08-28 23:48:40
So I’ve been looking to see why the BTC price has risen, looking I mean for a specific reason why it’s value has rose.
At present I can’t find any data which would support or suggest the price rise is caused by anything, so how come nothing can make the price rise???????
@_date: 2018-08-29 06:20:29
You mean manipulation though RIGHT?
20 thousand USD high was manipulation and TETHER token links with BTC.
Most other price rises are high frequency trading Bots, because this ecosystem is the Wild West and not governed properly.
I can send you a link if you’d like so you can see how some manipulate BTC prices???
There is no value only value created via speculation.
@_date: 2018-08-29 07:32:58
No values are based of production or true value is, you mentioned BTC use case or utility, only 17 million people own it and most are held by a few.
Use isn’t a word that I’d use, I don’t know anyone who uses it, debit cards are faster.
Why would I stand in a shop for an hour or more waiting for 6 confirmations , when I can walk in and out with my debit card.
Yes it does have special use case, if I’m a terrorist or money launderer, once they implement software so my transaction are hidden.
Apart from that I can’t see what it is it’s doing or can do that we don’t already use in one form or another.
@_date: 2018-08-30 07:30:15
No you shouldn’t expect a 21 year old to buy or need bitcoins, or anyone else, or is that when it suits the discussion to explain why BTC hasn’t and isn’t growing.
Only those millionaires sending vast amounts ���� or the 1000 wallet owners who own 40% of all bitcoins.
Of course adoptions happening, it’s just you can’t ever see it in the price. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:51:08
But that’s not an answer, you’re telling me to get an education, except you can’t rectify or show me evidence to the contrary ��, I would think about what your saying before you call people.
Try a simple question, without adoption which isn’t happening in BTC, and without speculative manipulation, how then is real value derived upon BTC?.
Take into account it produces nothing.
Please enlighten me.
@_date: 2018-08-29 08:20:42
I know all about the returns, that doesn’t mean I believe BTC has succeeded, it’s a Pyramid scheme all early investors win, if they’re in early enough, that doesn’t mean something will work, BTC’s adoption has failed miserably, not seeing how long people need to cotton on either they’ve had 9 years.
I work for a city investment firm, I know of no one or any clients that are interested in it, the volatility and manipulation is out of control.
I personally believe it’s dyeing, no one knows where it’s value is coming from, adoption is true value, and I mean people adoption (not my local shop accepts bitcoins) so it’s BOT trading and speculation.
@_date: 2018-08-29 07:05:58
It’s not big news if the public aren’t paying for coffee with BTC, point being it doesn’t matter who’s offering that you can pay with it, if you don’t use crypto then it’s nothing news.

You take a serious look at decentralised networks they promise what they can’t deliver, anonymity (it’s not anonymous)
You can get away without paying tax, you can’t as they will catch you for that tax sooner or later.
Cross border payments, here’s where a lot of people who aren’t declaring large amounts transferred are in time, going to find themselves facing money laundering charges and spending BIG TIME in prison.

Yeah I agree with the second speaker over the first.
No one can see it yet but BTC has a huge problem, mark my words, BTC won’t ever go back to 20 USD as the whole marked is seen as a pump and dump experiment.
What that mean is the miners will lose interest at some point, because they’re stupid at the moment, but in time they won’t be and they’ll back out.
BTC won’t last it’s a pipe dream built on a few people worldwide, no mass adoption just fool adoption,

And prey tell, what state have you lived in that’s stole your money, are you talking of shit states, like Venezuela?????
Who BTC was meant to help and others like it, but hasn’t.
Most of those kinda people are ironically using credit cards to pay for goods.
And what’s with the digital security bit, I mean are you a secret agent by any chance “007 maybe ?” Don’t be fooled about how many normal people outside this libertarian belief, even care about that, I personally don’t care as long as I’m insured, my bank account is secure, and my payment channels are insured.
Are you insured with BTC ����, how many joe public want to take those risks with complicated private keys, no insurance and a manipulated bot controlled market??????
So where really is the security, it’s a myth right, normal channel insurance is security, knowing you’ll be refunded, knowing there are people there who will work on your behalf.
Not oh I’ve been hacked and lost my savings, or I’ve been scammed.

I’m out now I can see lots of people paying with cards of one form or another, insured cards, you can try and sell BTC on it’s best point security on chain, as this was how it was meant to be ok.
Yet everyone has admitted that doesn’t work, it can’t scale so it’s security is compromised for that simple reason, you can’t have it both ways.
And yes simple supply and demand laws, show you now today, if you check the BTC price that demand isn’t there, if it were it would be rising, and price high equals more adoption.
Tell me why the price isn’t rising if the demand is there?
Tell me how the supply isn’t falling short, because of the surge in buying?
Now tell me how your figuring it’s being adopted?.

No I know all of it’s so called use cases, I’ve watched all of Andreas Antonopoulos videos, I don’t see those use cases as special in any way.
Let me give you an example, “IMMUTABILITY” this concept only suits the seller, not the buyer, how as the buyer do I dispute and get my money back, money or BTC that’s now buried under other blocks on the open Blockchain.
But if you like to show me one example id be pleased to give you my view.

You’ve not answered the question I said why is fiat worthless, state reasons??
Please educate yourself on the written English word and it’s meaning at the above site WORTHLESS one word not two meaning no value.��

Why don’t you try addressing them, so I can show you you’re wrong, probably deluded or a bitcoin convert who can’t see the truth.
Please try.
BTC has a problem already with price increase as people who are smart are asking how and where the value is coming from without “TETHER”, go back to 20 thousand USD days and it was a clear pump and dump, there is no mass adoption confidence because the mass market BTC would like isn’t interested in losing money on another pump and dump.
Or maybe you’re smart enough to show me evidence why the BTC price is rising now, I know you’re not and can’t because it’s not productive asset it’s got no value and for that reason only an artificial pump can increase price.
If you can’t show me or argue the facts I lay before you, it’s you that is clearly dumb.

It won’t happen, no ones interested, take Venezuela or any where else people were using plastic to pay for goods.
I know not one person who’s choosing BTC over debit card, NOT ONE, why because debit is better and insured.
Bitcoiners are lying in general if they believe adoption is happening, there is no price rise, when you see that you’ll know.
Bakkt may do that, because they have to buy Bitcoins, and like I keep telling people supply and demand will kick in and they’ll be higher prices.
Way higher if masses by in, if they don’t you’ll not see the price rise.
Let me tell you the xmas when BTC reached 20 thousand USD, there were a few smart people on here, one I remember in particular and he was constantly assaulted verbally for telling people to sell, as they thought the price would keep climbing.
Well it didn’t, and if those fools had listened, they’d of made a killing and bought back all their stocks and more at a fraction of the cost.
There’s some smart people on here, he was one.

Hasn’t any body got what a deflationary currency means?
You can have as many places as you like accepting BTC ( and hear the words this is huge) but if no one spends what will be worth more in the future ��, it’s doesn’t matter.
Not many use BTC, hodl hodl hodl, so one day people will see why it doesn’t work.

Clearly you’re not educating me at all and nor do I need it,  and I’ve read your low “level knowledge “of bitcoin and crypto in general, believe me you’ve made the correct choice running away.
Think I’d worked you out in an instant, so I toyed with you, not you me.
Maybe you should learn to read also, and comprehend what people say, rather than creating an English lesson, as a means of escape HILARIOUS !!!!!!!.

No my bank account has never had any money syphoned out of it, so mine is and has been secure, any other payment system i use has insurance, which means my bank or credit card company make sure I’m reimbursed.
How digital currency makes any difference is beyond me, why would a decentralised system that only 17 million people use, be valid in the real world.
Blockchain maybe.
All this is laughable when BTC is sold because it’s secure, it doesn’t do anything or solve any meaningful issues.
Exactly how secure is “LN” ???
Considering most TX won’t go onchain, because BTC can’t scale, how secure is “LN”, the answer is no one knows, and there are those who argue it’s not.
So what gives, BTC is already a failure.

Currencies aren’t reliable stores of value, stores of value is “gold”currency is devalued for a reason or reasons.
Read what a store of value is.

You see very clearly the BTC market and it’s problems, and a life line through Bakkt, you words I couldn’t agree with more.
Anyone who believes BTC isn’t in the last chance saloon, is IMO fooling themselves, hopefully Bakkt can deliver this one.

It’s meaningless, there is no value, it serves no purpose, no one uses it, it produces nothing, adoption has failed,it’s slow insecure, has had to have other layers built on top because of its original fuck ups that nakamoto failed to grasp in his software code and approach to economics.
What specifically don’t you understand about value.
Greater fool isn’t value, software updates are not value, transferring money through a decentralised system is only valuable to terrorist as they have an outcome from it, or money launderers.
What your link proves is nothing just more rubbish that portrays the BITCOIN con as a new work order.
17 million people is a flea on the worlds back, most bitcoins are owned by a few wallets, same as most fiat is owned by a few individuals, BTC doesn’t cure anything, I’m pissing myself laughing at its failures.
Why people can’t see it is because they’re desperate for price rises so they can get rich without any work�� think about it everyone will get rich, or is that “greater fool”, please immerse yourself in that though.
Everyone in the world will be rich, no one will work, how well it’s all going to work, fantastic world economy, buy crypto you’ll get rich.?????
Or you only get more of a fool buys higher than you?????.
The fools are already in, that’s why the BTC adoption rate is failing, the cleaver people can see it’s a Pyramid scheme.
