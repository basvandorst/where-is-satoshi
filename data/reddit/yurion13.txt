How can you compare Bitcoin with Enron and Bearnie Madoff? There is no comparison between them. 
Enron is a corporation, Bitcoin is ruled by a federal judge to be a commodity, and just like gold, if you buy high and sell low, you will lose money from trading Bitcoin. 
Madoff falsified returns to make his fund look good. Did Bitcoin ever falsified any returns on investment to attract you to buy it?

I know you have been really successful at trading BTC. Are you loaded up on BTC right now and waiting  for the next BTC halving to sell? I got lucky and bought a bunch of BTC at under $5k. I sold most of them around  $11k. But I can't figure out whether I should buy back in now or wait for about 3-4 months to buy back in.
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:44:19
explain it like this:
As ruled by a federal judge, Bitcoin is a commodity, commodity prices are determined by supply and demand. Supply of Bitcoin (inflation) decreases every 4 years, so the price of Bitcoin naturally goes up as time goes by. Just like the price of Oil, when Saudi Arabia and OPEC decides to cut production of oil, the price of Oil goes up.

@_date: 2019-06-23 15:50:56
You can explain that one large component of Bitcoin's value is dependent on supply and demand. Inflation of Bitcoin decreases by 50% every 4 years; this built in supply disruption happened twice already and causes the prices of bitcoin to go up just like when there is an oil supply disruption causes the prices of gas to go up.
Global demand is huge, China used to be the biggest. But USA is probably the biggest right now and institutional investors have a lot of USD to invest.

pro tip: when it comes to bitcoin, you don't have to buy at the very bottom. Buy a little at 5k, then a little again at 4k and so on. Even if it goes all the way down to 1k, it would still have been fine because the trend will eventually reverse. And you actually want the prices to go down when you are in the process of buying since you get more BTC for each dollar.

I am pretty sure it will go up again. The futures market provides more opportunities for trading, it is not the main cause of the recent correction. In fact, if you compare the previous bull market of 2014 (peak at $1200) with the recent bull market, bitcoin prices should have peaked at $12,000 (a 1000&amp; increase in 4 years), not 20K.

When btc was around 4k, I heard someone talking about waiting for 6k to confirm end of bear market to buy btc again. That really makes no sense, why would you buy at 6k when you could have bought at 4k? Sure, it could have gotten all the way down to 2k after you buy at 4k, but it is still better than buying at 6k to save yourself 2 grand if you buy a full coin.
You have to believe in Bitcoin if you are an investor, and as an investor, **you want the prices to be low when you buy (which is the reason why people say BTFD)**, and high when you sell. You did yourself a disservice by selling at 6k and not rebuying what you sold at 3k to 5k. But instead, you bought at $7900. That's just not smart investing, I hope you learned a lesson there.

I mostly send BTC from one exchange to another exchange. I wonder if the exchanges can use the lightning network to exchange bitcoins.

if you own 140k BTC like [Block.one]( you will also be trying to make BTC transactions fast and cheap. Imagine having less than 1 second confirmation time when you send BTC to someone using a BTC sidechain on EOS.

I guess you have to leave a will stating who is going to inherit your bitcoins and from which exchange. If your child provides a death certificate to Coinbase, they should be able to verify that you are indeed dead and they could just sell your bitcoins at market rate and send a check to your estate.

unpopular opinion, store your BTC in Coinbase or other exchanges requiring KYC. When you die, your BTC will be distributed to your estate by these exchanges.

ask the hacker that stole bitcoins from Bitfinex 2 years ago. Those bitcoins are still in the hacker's address.

This says Amazon will. Credit card fees are ridiculously high. Crypto is the answer to lower their transaction costs.

that's why bitcoin is good for us. The USD is made to lose value at about 2% a year to keep the economy going. If you like saving money, then you should convert your USD to bitcoin. If you want to stimulate the economy then convert some of your bitcoin to USD and spend it as you like.

USD beats Venezuelan Bolivar, Bitcoin beats USD. Truth!
