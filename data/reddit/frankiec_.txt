Is buying with bank bad? I know it takes a few days to get the money but does it lock in the rate at time​ of purchase?

Hodling too. Fuck it

I should have bought last night but my damn credit card takes forever to build up the amount that I'm allowed. Wish coinbase could help us out and use more if they see were active.

I bought some more before too thru bank. Waiting a week sucks. Hopefully the prices will be lower

Thanks for the feedback guys. I'm leaning towards Trezor because I read they have better security and user interface. On Trezor, can I add other currencies other than Bitcoin? Thanks.

If you go in with a group and buy 20 machine or more. It is profitable

Damn I got cracked too smh I don't know when it will stop dropping so I can buy again.

Is it bad that I just bought some? Or should I have waited longer?

Bro, listen to this. Last week I bought while it went to the all time high. I was convinced it would hit $8,000. It went down drastically. I kept checking the chart, which was not good and stupid, I started to panic. Then I said fuck it. I'm going to HODL. And now it went back up.

No. I first heard of bitcoin in this past spring/early summer. Haven't heard of it before. Wish I did. I'd be a millionaire by now ��

Where do you see that? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:43:34
I bought the max I could with card. Locked in at $6,075. I should have bought when it went down to 5500. Think I got a good rate? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:31:02
I bought some when it was around 7k and under. Bought some more right before the peek. Now it dropped smh ��.. I'm just holding on trying not to panic.

Thanks. Yeah I read something about more secure. I have my currency in coinbase so I just want something more secure. Hard to wait for January 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:15:20
That's true. I like use my card but I don't have not even half of the maximum amount I can use. I've used it slot the past week. Bank takes forever smh. What should I do? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:06:02
I'm not lying to myself. I held on. Funny you're telling me what I would do. Tell me if it's going to hit $20,000 so I can put more 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:35:23
Thank you. Damn I bought some couple days ago at a much higher price. It will be available in couple more days. I just hope I get it low. I only got couple hundred left on credit card limit smh
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:49:52
You're right bro. Thanks. I try to think long term all the time. Problem was the chart. I been glued to it for the past couple of hours. It was exciting but then it fucks with your head. I'll be waiting next few days for bank to clear too
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:10:49
Thanks for your advice. I'm staying up late to keep an eye on it.

What about mining litecoin?
