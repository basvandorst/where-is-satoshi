After all the drama, the last sentence:  "Mr. Rose аddѕ thаt 'Ovеrаll, dеѕрitе mу Bitfinеx liԛuidаtiоn, I’m still dоing bеttеr with mу investments than I wоuld have if I hаd stayed in indеx fundѕ.'"

How do you plan to move forward?  
There are many possible solutions to this situation.... A. Just hold and hope for a return to and beyond all time highs and forget about the 5k for now. B. Sell at a loss and get out. C. Dollar cost average and try to make gains on individual trades rather than just hodling.

There are a few threads that go into depth on the cryptocurrency feed. But here's the short version: The trustee sold 36,000 BTC in Jan and Feb which coincides with the major drops, arguably causing the major drops in the market from which we still haven't recovered. They have more BTC but nobody knows if they will dump them.

Good! You bought the dip!  Put it in a wallet and hold it. When price jumps you can decide when to take profits. Don't sell at a loss and expect some ping pong shit in terms of price.

You can connect a bank debit card to coinbase. Not sure what the stipulations are but you can do it and have instant buys during the dip.

You'll be fine. Don't sell at a loss.

Blockfolio almost always shows Bitstamp as having the most bitcoin volume with coinbase nearly tied.

The 24 hour volume earlier today was 333 million dollars on both coinbase and Bitstamp. That's more volume than I've seen in awhile.
