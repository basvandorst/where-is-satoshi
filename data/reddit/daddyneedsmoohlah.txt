Dude, they just said they believe it will be a multi-trillion dollar market cap in the future. Short-term overvaluation has nothing to do with long-term. Some of us aren't day traders. We are HODLing for years and years and years. I can give 2 shits if it's worth 20k or 5k in 2 weeks. It's not my job to day trade and predict those things and gamble that I'm right. I play the LONG game. I kept all my money in my Vanguard SP500 Index funds back in 2008 and am up well over 400% now. I didn't run for the hills just because the experts in the media and on forums said to. No different than the stupid liberal media idiots who claimed Trump would tank the stock market LOL. Wrong again.

Possible but it works both ways. I plan on cashing out some stocks in my fidelity acct on jan 1st so I can use the funds on some cryptos and push the cap gains onto my 2018 return.  So money coming out will also be coming in with people like me pushing in stock money.

Go look at the amazon reviews. 3.5 stars for Ledger with 300 plus reviews and 4.5 stars fo Trezor with 300 plus reviews. There is a reason the Trezor is always sold out and costs more on the aftermarket. It's the better wallet.  Period. Those reviews on Amazon say it all.

At what point does perception become reality????? If Roger Ver is going to be on the attack every week on CNBC and the hosts on CNBC carry his water then how is Bitcoin going to grow and stop Bitcoin Cash from taking over? This is a real problem. At some point perception does become reality and novice investors aren't going to care about the "technical" analysis if they keep seeing BCH going up and BTC getting shitted on every night on TV.

Not sure about Coinbase. I know gemini is fine with it as that's what my wife and I do from the same laptop. It allows us to put $1000 in a day thru ACH instead of just $500.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:47:43
The thing with Bitcoin that the "experts" are getting wrong is the global money invested. They keep talking about the market cap and how only 16 SP500 companies are bigger. However, how much of the money invested in Bitcoin right now is even from USA citizens? 25%? Bitcoin has so much potential because it can take off without even having majority USA money invested in it. If it ever does get to the point where more than 50% of the money is from USA citizens than we are talking a big time price. People need to get some skin in the game........the risk is well worth the potential reward imo.

So would I pay the tax on the 6k it was worth when I received it at my ordinary tax income rate on next year's return? If I decide to leave it in for 3 more years and it grows to 40k before I cash out then I would only pay long-term capital gains on the 34k it grew above the 6k I already paid taxes on?

Amazon was founded in 1994. Google in 1998. 95% of all the cryptos you see today will be shit. However, make no mistake, there will be a handful that survive and become much bigger then they are now. To act like all of the cryptos will burn and crash is nonsense. "If" Bitcoin survives and thrives it will be worth much more then it is now. That's the gamble. If you don't believe in it then don't put money into it. Simple as that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:52:05
If you simply want BTC then definitely Gemini. Gemini only trades BTC and ETH. If you want other alts then I would use Gemini as your base for buying BTC or ETH and then find another exchange or use shapeshift.io to convert the BTC or ETH into other alts. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:28:56
True. On the flip side, it could blow up 100 fold if it gets mass adoption. Thus, the volatility and risk/reward is off the charts. Nobody knows who is right. The "moon" brigade or the "doomsday" brigade. One thing I do know is that I would rather lose 5-10% of my investing money going for a knock out punch rather than parking it 100% in a SP500 Index Fund jabbing and grappling after I'm already up big since 2008 riding that train.

You can use that address to receive money and don't have to have your Trezor open to receive it. Simply give it to the person who is suppossed to pay you and the money will arrive to that address and show in your Trezor once it is sent  and confirmed. However, most people advise not using the same address to receive money twice so generate a new address for each payment you are expected to receive. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:20:38
 Sign up for account at Gemini and wait to get verified.  Once verified, send your BTC from Coinbase to GDAX and then to Gemini.  Close Coinbase and GDAX accounts. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:36:56
Coinbase is a wallet and GDAX is their exchange. It's cheaper to send from GDAX to Gemini then from Coinbase. Gemini only sells and trades BTC and ETH so you would need to buy BTC or ETH on Gemini and then use another exchange or Shapeshift.io to trade for another alt. There are not many exchanges I trust to wire in a lot of money but Gemini is the one I trust the most. They are regulated out of New York State and they do everything on the up and up.

I would wait for Kraken to be up and running first. However, I personally like Kraken. Haven't had any issues with them but I only use them to trade and ship BTC in and out of Gemini when I want to trade for alts or convert back to fiat. I have heard stories about wires getting lost or held up at Kraken so I'm too afraid to actually send them a wire.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:08:20
Ok. I run an online web design business and I have been paid a few times by customers overseas with BTC. So, let's say, I got paid 1 BTC a few months ago for $6000 total. Do I have to pay taxes on that 6k on next year's tax return even if I never sold it to USD yet? Or do I simply pay taxes on it(plus gains) 3 years from now if I held it for 3 years and then sell it.

Bro, you can compete with 25% all day long by picking the right stocks in the market. Easy? Hell no. Doable? Hell yes. People aren't going to risk investing in Bitcoin if the returns aren't far and away greater than what they can do in the stock market. Just ain't happening. People are here for the high risk/high reward. You can believe what you want. That's the truth of the matter.

Last question. So if I buy .33 BTC for example on 12/15/17 than I should also note what the .33 BTC was worth at that moment of the trade/buy(ie $5700). So I need to keep track of the amount in BTC and also the value that amount was worth in USD at that exact moment?

I agree. I get the "diversification" angle but this isn't normal stock market investing. This whole industry will sink or swim based on Bitcoin for at least the next couple years imo. Some coin may eventually take over as the dominant one but good luck picking that one if it even exists yet. I do think Bitcoin and Monero are the two best long-term bets right now. My 2 cents. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:17:26

I guess. However, wouldn't I be double taxed on the 4k difference? If I pay normal tax rate on the 6k today and that comes out to 2k in taxes than why wouldn't my new basis be 6k for my cash out 3 years from now? Wouldn't I be paying capital gains on the 4k spread that I already reported as normal income and had to pay the ordinary tax rate on?
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:08:23
Disagree. Supply and demand. The demand is off the charts right now and growing. I don't put any stock in the 1 million dollar forecasts because demand could change when the growth slows down but right now????????? The demand is off the charts and will keep this thing growing for months. Not far fetched at all to see this thing reach 30k by March-April.

What if you buy 1 BTC and then trade it for 100 XMR and then cash out 3 years later to USD. How do you determine the long-term gains if your original buy was in BTC but you end up selling XMR to USD? Curious about that because I plan on selling some of my BTC for alts soon and either cashing out to USD down the road or trading back to BTC before cashing out to USD.

I do agree on the gains from now on becoming broing and SLOOOOOOOOOW compared to what made crypto really different and unique. I also question how this grows to 250k plus if the gains are more consistent with normal stock investing. Some people will certainly be happy with that but I prefer the "boom or bust" volatility where it scares off the weak hands and rewards the strong ones. Those days are probably gone or will be very soon.

If people continue to buy monthly and the price is higher than their current price per coin then their avg price will continue to increase. Someone could have bought 10 coins at 1k each but if he continues to pump in 1k a month for the next 24 months than he is slowly increasing his average per coin amount. People talk about dollar cost averaging but that is out the window for people who bought in really low. Hell, it might be out the window soon for people buying in at these amounts if it goes to 25k soon and doesn't come back down to these levels.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:40:26
Yes. Personally, if it ever happened, I would buy two new trezors or ledger nanos and recover the money on one and then immediately send all of it to the other trezor/nano that never had to be recovered by seed. Why? I just wouldn't trust my money sitting in a wallet that had to be recovered by seed once. I would be too paranoid no matter how many times people said it was fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:07:59
If I wasn't making money. Period. The minute the volatility dries up and this becomes a boring 10%-25% annual return type of thing is the minute I sell and dump the profits back into the stock market. I'm sure I'm in the majority. The only reason to even be in Bitcoin is the "go big or go home" aspect of it where there is potential for HUGE gains at the risk of going belly up. If it becomes too "stable" I am out. Volatility is what is driving big money into this arena.....make no mistake about it. It's a blessing and not a curse.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:09:57
Ya, I hear ya. I was only up 20K profit at the time it crashed so I was still ahead of the game even at the 14k price. However, imagine being up 500k and seeing 6 figure chunks of profit being chopped off in minutes?????? Crazy. I was thinking of taking another 50k out of my Vanguard stock acct and buying more cryptos after Jan 1st but this was a good reality check for me. I think I will slow my roll a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:33:50
Th big money is in alts..........if you choose the right ones. You can also, and more likely, lose your ass in alts. The problem with bitcoin is it's going to slow down considerably imo. The "futures" was bad for the volatility and the big dips/increases. I'm definitely going into alts after they come down from their recent run. Got my eye on a couple I think can and will increase 400-500% over the next 12-24 months.

@_date: 2017-12-05 15:50:32
Could be. Could not. I do think easily 90% of the people saying it's a "bubble" are swayed by their hope that it truly is because they are jealous of people who have significant holdings of bitcoin. Instead of being jealous they should get some skin in the game. That's the problem with most people in society. Everyone is always jealous of someone with more money than them instead of finding ways to make more money for themselves. I'm playing the long game with Bitcoin......I'd rather lose money being in the game than sit on the sideline with regret that I didn't pour in 5-10% of my money into this phenomenon. People claim Bitcoin is too easy. I disagree. Seems to me a lot of people are too afraid to invest because they are worried about losing money. Sometimes you have to take chances in life. Scared money makes no money.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:14:57

You have to play the long game imo. No different than the stock market. Ignore the noise. I kept 100% invested in my SP500 Index Funds at Vanguard thru the 2008 crash and never thought twice about selling despite the dooms day "experts" on tv and online giving advice where to sell and park money. I was 400k in the hole at the time. Best decision of my life. I look at Bitcoin the same way. It may crash to ZERO but I will be one of those still HODLING if/when it does get to 500k plus. Long game son......ignore the noise.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:32:45
Gemini only charges $1.25 fee to buy any amount of BTC per transaction after you wire or ACH your money in. They also send your BTC to the wallet of your choice for free if you are planning on doing cold storage. Great setup.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:58:22
Yes, in theory. However, the public will still trust the annualized 10% returns of the 100 plus year old stock market as oppossed to the relatively young crypto market that is always being accused of being a   "ponzi" or "fraud". I agree with you 100% but I'm just saying how the novice investor will look at it. People are taking out loans, cashing out IRAs and selling off stocks to invest in BTC because of the high returns they "think" they can get. If those returns become normal "stock market-esque" returns than the demand and desire to do that will dry up quick. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:35:11

I can see long-term HODlers taking profit and paying just 15% or 20% cap gains. I don't understand the short-term investors cashing out before Jan 1st because the new tax plan just passed by Congress will save them significantly if they wait until Jan 1st to sell.

No disrespect, but that's like buying penny stocks because "in your head" it's easier to go to 5 cents than a company like Amazon to go from 1k to 5k in stock price. If it was that easy than all of us would create coins and drive it to 5 cents and become rich. Don't work that way. Ethereum may outperform Bitcoin in the future but it won't be because of price. Supply and demand bro.......Bitcoin has a much higher demand right now and it will drive the price up faster imo. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:43:19

Dude, if it was "stable" all the time than it would never get the huge gains that are attracting all the new money. Period. Anyone saying differently is in denial. The worst thing for Bitcoin would be to be "stable" imo. If it was than all the new investors wouldn't have a reason to invest and leave their money in the stock market. Volatility is what Bitcoin needs to continue to grow. Call it a bubble, call it what you want.........the minute Bitcoin becomes "stable" and "boring" the huge gains are over. The only reason to park money in Bitcoin over the stock market are the 10x returns in Bitcoins favor.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:20:09
Good point. That's why I put no stock in people saying that Bitcoin will create all these millionaires. How many people will truly HODL if it goes to 100k and dips back to 40-50k??? How about if it goes to 200k and dips to 100k? A lot of weak hands will sell and not be invested enough to truly get rich off a 1 million dollar price. It's easy to talk it but completely different to walk it when we start talking that kind of money. However, make no mistake, I think Bitcoin will either go to 500k plus or it will bust out and be no higher than it is today 10 years from now. No in between because I think if the demand ever slows down significantly than it will get replaced by another crypto and the price will tank and not recover. My opinion. Basically moon or bust long-term in my eyes.

I learned this the hard way 2 weeks ago today. My wife and I were expecting our 2nd child and 1st son. She was 34 weeks pregnant and everything going great until we went for her routine ob-gyn appt and they found no heart beat. Crushed. Had to take her to the hospital that night and see her go thru labor for a still born baby. No bitcoin on earth will ever take that pain away and I doubt my wife will ever be the same emotionally and mentally. Just goes to show you that you can be living high on the hog one moment and the most unexpected event can totally change your life. I would give anything to take that pain away from my wife. My perspective on life changed so much. Invest wisely and don't let bitcoin consume your life boys....life comes at you fast.

Amazon probably has it's eyes on something bigger like starting their own exchange and/or a Bitcoin online bank that has BTC owners leave their coins with Amazon while getting some type of insurance(ie upto 50k-100k) in case they ever get hacked. Some big player(Amazon, Facebook, Google) is going to take that market it's only a matter of time. When/if this thing blows up and becomes really mainstream, these cold wallets(Trezor, Ledger nano S) are going to be like using old flip phones. People will leave their coins with a big company like Amazon/Google for the insurance like they do with banks that are FDIC insured instead of under their mattress.

To you. Not to me. It's like getting into a car accident and getting the fixed car back. Sure, it looks and probably drives the same. However, it's no longer pure and unblemished. Some of us like our stuff in mint condition with no warts. It makes no sense to you but I'm different. Why would I want to keep a device that I had to type in the seed for online????? Now my seed was typed online and key loggers could steal that info. I'm not risking that to save a measly $85.

Don't listen to the haters and tools. You will be fine. Keep active in trying to communicate with them and keep making waves on social media and on reddit. Don't get hostile but definitely keep your foot on the gas. You will get your money. The worst move would be staying silent or getting hostile about it and making them want to drag their feet. Good luck boss.......and helluva job making that much money on bitcoin! Awesome.

Ya, well, why uninstall? They went cheap and didn't give it enough storage. Waste of time and money.

What's the lowest you would go on Trezor and have it be confirmed in 12 hours or less? Do you think .00060 is fine?

Yes, it looks like any other stupid usb stick. Fugly.

True. I plan on buying a ledger nano s myself and was wondering about that. Thanks.

A lot of these so-called "experts" don't know their backside from their elbow. Case in point, the talking heads over at MarketWatch. They have been predicting a stock market collapse/correction for at least 4-5 years now and it still hasn't happened. Even when it eventually does have a significant correction of 20% the people who did not listen to these motor mouths the last 4-5 years and stayed invested in the SP500 Index Fund will still have more money than had they pulled out.

Ya, it's crazy. I bought one on Amazon for $85 a couple weeks ago. It was selling from $80 to $85 on amazon that whole week but now it's up to like $140. All the "prime" sellers completely sold out their stock. Crazy. I inquired on Trezor's website about buying in bulk to sell on Amazon and they gave me the price sheet. You can get them for as little as 54 euros to resell on amazon but you have to buy like 5k of them. You could also buy like 100 of them for 67.50 euros each(plus import fees to get them in USA at amazon warehouses).  The resellers on Amazon are allowed to sell on Amazon because I was upfront with them about selling them on my Amazon store and they will take my order if I decide to do it. Lots of competition though. The price should come back down when these sellers get more inventory and they start competing for the lowest price to win the "buy box" on Amazon.

All these talking heads on CNBC are the same "experts" who try and convince people they need a financial advisor as opposed to simply investing in Index Funds. I'd rather take my chances parking my own money in a SP500 Index Fund and Bitcoin than having some financial advisor picking my mutual funds for me and getting commissions. They will never like Bitcoin for the same reason they don't like Index Funds......customers don't need "experts" to invest in them.

It's volatile. If I didn't have a family to support and was still single with no kids than I would easily roll the dice and throw 50% of my investments at Vanguard into this. However, I have mouths to feed so I'm only doing 5% to potentially 10% so that I can survive if it crashes to dust.  Once the risk outweighs the reward this thing could come crumbling down. Right now the demand is HOT because people see the reward far outweighing the risk. At some point that could change. We will see.

LOL........oh look, another Reddit basement dweller who's mad he owns no bitcoins. I'll bookmark this and come back to it in 6 months. We'll see who is right. Meanwhile, get back to the basement and clean your room before Mommy comes home from working to support your pathetic fat ass.

Probably has a bunch of fake followers he bought. A lot of sites sell fake followers packages so businesses can look like they are bigger than they really are on social media.

Impressive. I was in your spot one day.........3 kids later lol and I can't be as aggressive as I would like. In your spot(ie no kids), I think you can afford to go 65% in a Vanguard SP500 Index Fund and the other 35% in Bitcoin. The SP500 Index Fund should double every 8-9 years if you leave it alone and reinvest dividends. The Bitcoin money will ultimately decide whether you live a very good life or a RICH MAN's life. It's the ultimate boom or bust investment. You are young enough to go for it...........I would. Good luck boss.

Bingo. Exactly.

My philosophy is be in it to win it or be out completely. Go big or go home. I'm not saying put more than you can afford to lose in it but you have to be in it to make HUGE gains or what's the point? If you want "solid" gains than go invest in Amazon, Apple, Netflix or a SP500 Index Fund. That's where 90% of my investment money is parked. The other 10% is "ALL IN" on Bitcoin and I'm prepared to lose it all. However, I won't sell until it hits 6 figures minimum. If it doesn't, it doesn't. I left all my investments in the stock market after the 2008 crash and that's money I can't afford to lose lol. This ain't nothing. This is go big or home, swing for the fences style investing. I love it.
