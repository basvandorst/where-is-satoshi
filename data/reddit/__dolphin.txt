read to get a 2nd perspective.

If you have less than $100 BTC it makes no sense to keep it on a wallet - you would lose most of your money getting it out in fees atm.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:40:36
There were already periods of big fees that paralleled now in May... see: 
The signs that this would happen again and soon were clear as day. So it made no sense to reject 2x.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:17:59
Why would a block size increase happen now when 2x was so adamantly rejected?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:27:30
So you lost money sending it?
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:37:56
Limited block size creates a fee market. It doesn't have to do with hashpower. Hashpower increases can temporarily mine blocks faster.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:37:55
They probably released it now to avoid releasing during the holidays.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:46:08
is the place.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:18:14
They did it because it was a coin that proved to be in demand. Free market magic at work.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:41:12
Yep thats the minimum BTC fee nowadays to send within the next few hours.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:51:37
Omg that is cool!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:41:56
It's Tether... USDT settling balances on the blockchain. It's not money they're sending but information.
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:19:36
To do so would be incredibly expensive because those fees add up. It was attempted previously with no luck 
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:23:08
Why is it dumb if some people would want that? Also in plenty countries $250 is a lot of money. Don't we want to decentralize?
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:22:33
My random guess... it's value needs to be above $400 and theyll probably wait a month.
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:57:15
It can't retroactively change old blocks though? Misunderstood - I guess once the block chain grows you can't reduce it
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:15:20
It runs into the same problem as BTC if scaled. BCH has shown a willingness to increase block size
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:39:20
BCC is typically used for Bitcoin Cash. Nothing can scale "exponentially". 
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:38:07
Try :)
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:29:11
Segwit won't do much and by the time it does it will be too little too late. This is why Bitcoin Cash was created
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:59:09
But if you alert the community the response is to hard fork?
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:29:45
supports the fork as far as I can tell
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:15:01
Funny that's the same reason I'm optimistic about Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:49:15
I'm no expert but basically see bitcoin as a bunch of data and code. Up till now, everyone had the same code. Starting today there are two copies- the history is the same but their future is different. There are two different visions.
So the amount you bought before today and the keys are the same on each chain.
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:07:43
Not really they're incredibly expensive as demonstrated by Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:17:47
It's not broken but rather working as intended - to take miners away from BTC. If it becomes an issue, BCH is not afraid to hardfork.
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:12:38
No it can't be removed later. That's not how the block chain works. Once it's in, it's in
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:31:10
LTC doesn't offer anything unique. It will have the same problems as Bitcoin if it grows. BCC offers unique solutions to scaling whether you agree or not 
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:08:17
If you're holding fiat you're expecting the value of btc+bcc to be less after the fork than btc now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:50:03
He did not create Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:09:39
What shady ways? It was simple change - a change that was intended to be done by Satoshi when it was required.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:22:07
Well its at 15% of its value now so let's give it more credit.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:11:46
We had months to come into consensus. It was a trivial code change. People either didn't educate themselves on it or didn't want it - you expect it to go differently next time? Lol
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:29:28
Yes and yes. It will be competitive.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:20:30
Even if this were true and Jihan and Ver are the ones buying (no evidence though) - who cares what they do with their money? They will buy the thing they believe in.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:47:36
I gave you an example of listing one price out of context and how little it means. To see examples of increased inflation-adjusted prices see education costs, healthcare costs, even food.

Millennials only own a small fraction of wealth but are on the hook for a large portion of past gov debt as their lifetime goes on. It's unclear that whatever "economic growth" there was benefited them more than fiscal responsibility would have. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:30:19
I don't think they've clarified what they will do.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:49:57
I have found much more technical discussion in :-)
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:17:05
LTC has a 1 MB block size (+ segwit) which is the same as BTC. However, BCH has shown a willingness to increase block size. Despite what the heavy censorship here might indicate, there are a number of people who want an identical Bitcoin but one that shows a willingness to increase block size.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:18:25
Tbf it's only been around since Aug 1 and there's already been traction. ie BitPay
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:49:19
Evidence that it is artificial?
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:41:12


It's been 3 years since this debate began. It's far from willy nilly. And if it wasn't increased now - who has the time to stick around? BCH is here now.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:40:35
House in SF came out in 1970 for 20k. Now it's 1 million with little to no alterations. Your point?
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:14:51
Yes any coin could take off. Why should people assume BTC will always be 
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:38:12
Interesting - what about mainland Chinese who visit Hong Kong? Seems like a big loop hole to me.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:11:24
Whatever you do, ask the same question to - it's a great community. Take all answers here with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:28:09
So would a company operating in Hong Kong be able to sell to the mainland Chinese and thereby circumvent the laws there somehow? Or would the extent of its operations need to be in Hong Kong or internationally? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:09:38
Just a note - no one in that community calls it Bcash so its very silly to call it that. It's Bitcoin Cash. Does show a strong bias.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:22:53
Why is Bitcoin w Segwit not a version here? Bias?
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:00:12
Eh all it means is that the halving will come 1.5 months sooner and the block rewards won't end in 2140 but November 2139. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:09:55


That seems difficult though except for the very motivated
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:07:31
The code in BCC is closer to the original
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:16:04
Are these based even in the US? Not sure, but hypothetically they might not be.
