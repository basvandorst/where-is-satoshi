seconded. quicker to update your hodlings, simpler interface.

Great! Let me know what you think.

Thanks mate. Happy to add this feature, but not exactly sure what you're asking. Do you mean you'd like to see "up $50 (+33%)" or are you asking for something more elaborate like the cost of each currency? Because I was trying to avoid that as I think most people are trading between coins too much to make this easily updated.
Even if you draw up an example, I can build it.

Consider this.
- The majority of bitcoin is owned by those who mine bitcoin
- The majority of hashpower comes from China
- China has banned crypto exchanges
- All the 'weird' price movements happen on weekends
- Korea is close to China
- It's the weekend in China
- More than 50% of the bitcoin cash trading is happening in Korea.
Pair this with:
- The miners and big bitcoin companies want to increase their control of bitcoin
- They also support bitcoin cash

Red = miner has abandoned bitcoin
Green = hashpower contribution about the same or (in the case of  Slushpool, BTCC and Antpool) increased
Blue = too hard to tell.
BTC.top and F2pool have clearly moved to BCH in the last 24 hours.

Literally from your link:

Yes, it does. This does not track your trades, rather you update your holdings with the number of coins you have. This eliminates the need for factoring in trading fees (something I really wanted to avoid when I first designed this).

An unfortunate lapse in attention by me.

Thanks for pointing this out. 
You'll have to tidy up the "cost" column with the total amount you spent at the time of each 'snapshot'.
I've updated the instructions to reflect this. Cheers.
