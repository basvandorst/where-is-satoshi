nice solution if you have plenty of time on your hands. QR codes are necessary though for my use case. Thanks

second paragraph of this story...
"BitFlyer handles about a quarter of the globe’s Bitcoin exchange volumes, with more than 250 billion US dollars worth of Bitcoin being traded on its platform last year."
Bitflyer has only 2.67% bitcoin trade volume at the moment (23/1/2018). In fact there is no platform that has more than 10% trade volume and has been like this for some time. Where does this writer get this 25% claim from?
Sorry but with such bullshit claims, cannot keep reading anything more from the site with this story

bullshit, today is only 2.67%
nobody comes close to 25%

I am in switzerland and seems that all printers in our bricks and mortar shops and also online shops such as digitec.ch are in some way wifi enabled. Where are you looking. Please point it out to me.
Also want this printer to be linux compatible. I am using this site to test for Linux compatibility

Hey just before someone gets all carried away with a detailed answer for me, I have solved the problem
I took a high res image of the QR code to the private key and then played with it in GIMP till the QR code scanner would wake up and read it.
Converting the image to black and white then pumping the contrast did the trick.

buy opportunity?

Thanks for the comments. As I said I solved the problem now. I try to have both ASCII and QR because QR is simply so much easier to work with.
Aware that there is alway the risk of loosing control of the private keys if you leave the QR code somewhere visible considering there are dozens of apps on my phone that for some reason want access to the camera of my phone (some apps have no business with this access!). I block them now, but what about someone elses phone!
Shit!, the world we live in!!

In general, there is a slow movement away from the USD as preeminent international currency. So many factors play into it. Some are purely economic and some are also ideological. After all it is the willingness of other countries to purchase US debt in the form of bonds that enable the US to patrol the world with their war machine and treat every problem like a hammer to a nail.
Even though Iraq and Libya were sold as humanitarian missions, they were in fact veiled exershions of imperial superpremicy to ensure the continuation of the Petro dollar standard. Both Iraq and Libya expressed an interest to sell their oil in something other than USD (Saddam wanted to use EURO and Muammar Gaddafi wanted to do it for Gold) These expressions of interest were made shortly before the US deemed it necessary to move in and sort things out.
Now the buyer of last resort for US Debt is the Federal Reserve Bank. But they have bought already soo many and have said they will draw down their balance sheet - somehow.
This is the inflection point we stand at now. If buyers for US debt do not appear, then bond prices will fall, i.e. bond yields will rise, i.e. interest rates follow bond yields so interest rates go up. Debts are harder to pay. Many corporations have used the cheap money (low interest rate debt) to buy back their own shares to make themselves prettier. That game will end with higher rates.
This daisy chain is long.....
So this may give a small feeling for what is now playing out on the markets..

You must first understand the deal between the house of Saud and the US under Nixon (Henry Kissinger did the deal) that guaranteed the preeminence of the house of Saud as the rulers of Saudi arabia, and the integrity of Saudi Arabia in the middle east region.
In return The House of Saud promised to only sell their oil on the international market in USD and to recycle excess USD into US Treasuries. (a sanitised version 
Being the dominant player in OPEC (being just a little over a decade old at this time) Saudia Arabia´s decision to exclusively use USD for trading pulled the other opec members to follow suit.
Expanding and solidifying the market share of the USD in world trade has bestowed enormous economic advantage to the US over all other countries without over use of military power.
But off course nothing stays as it is and as we close into the 50th anniversary of this event, the signs that this arrangement is almost over are appearing
btw. seemingly unrelated, but in fact key to understanding this foreign policy action in the early 1970's is the closing of the "gold window"
