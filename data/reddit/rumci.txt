Yes, I know about this. I have plenty of drive space, and a fairly solid unlimited connection (80Mbps down, 10Mbps up) so i am ok with that.
Is it a problem if I only run it a couple of hours per day though?

Hey, it's me, your Fry.

Ledger, Trezor, etc.

First - this is pretty old news.
Second - don't give the travesty of a website bitcoin.com extra traffic.

You're drunk mate, aren't you?

Really useful project to learn javascript, good for you mate.
Bit of constructive criticism time?  Right now it's basically just displaying the page in a separate application. Not groundbreaking. I have my browser open all the time, I wouldn't use that.
BUT, if you really keep working on extra features like you've mentioned (especially the price notifications), I will be using the shit out of it.
Good luck!

Aaaaand it's gone.

This is probably as good as it could realistically get.

Now BTC and Ethereum seem to be working for me as well (1:45 PM CET). Thanks for the heads up!

It's been like 6 hours now.. I don't want to jump the hate bandwagon, I get that their overloaded... but it sure gets frustrating.

No it isn't. Assuming Coinable == Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:21:05
Well, it sure would be nice if those users could actually use the service. Their 1-2 hour estimation has turned into 6+ at this point..

Coinbase FINALLY seems to work fine for me (BTC, EHT). Cannot buy LTC though.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:14:01
No, Coinbase is **NOT** only for US citizens.
And dizzylight made a typo (I guess), and wrote "coinable".
