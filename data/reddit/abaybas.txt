Glad to see you are still around. Hope you get it resolved.
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:59:28
Thanks! I guess I should fill up changetip so I can start doing this myself.

Unfortunately, in the grand scheme of things OP is a small miner, leaving the larger miners more of the pie. The few hobbyists would barely register at today's hash rates.
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:33:34
Hah! That's exactly what I've been doing so I need something else to distract myself.
@_date: 2014-10-01 15:55:36
Looking forward to HD wallets. Thanks for the update.
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:35:59
Yeah I did pick some up from circle.
I know it's money but what are some things that I can do with it that I can't already do with a credit card? I know about micro tipping on reddit. That's cool. What else?

His user page no longer exists. I'm not sure if he's shadow banned or he deleted his account.
@_date: 2014-10-14 20:43:26
Do you offer the same discount if they pay with cash?
I guess you prefer bitcoin since there's no worry about counterfeits or about securing the cash in your physical store or transporting to the local bank.
@_date: 2014-10-15 21:41:34
I got that message but I just ignored it and it was fine.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:55:45
Are you a generous bitcoin tipper?
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:50:16
Bought with VISA from Canada. Only bought $100 to see if I get cash advance fees.
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:23:31
You meet in person and pay in cash.
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:08:42
Confirmed with TD Visa from me as well. I haven't seen the price on my statement yet so I can't confirm the CC fee yet.
Do you know if TD charges cash advance per day? Should I pay it off right away to minimize interest?
@_date: 2014-10-15 20:17:01
I used both TD VISA and a TD Debit Visa card to buy from circle.com
I recommend debit visa, otherwise you get charged a cash advance fee.
You can also use mycelium android app to buy locally.
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:45:41
 is cool. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:30:10
I'm guessing they control the exchange rate for buying/selling bitcoin. Probably a +5%. I would probably be ok with that rate if it's as instant as they claim.
@_date: 2014-10-12 14:24:19
Problem is if governments feels threatened enough they can stop the merchants and exchanges. This won't kill Bitcoin but it'll push it underground to a smaller niche market.

A lot of office printers have hard drives where they keep an archive of printed documents for years. Some of these hard drives end up in the hands of identity thieves.

He does own about 8% of all the bitcoins in existence. It appears he hasn't touched them, but now that he's being bothered who know what he'll do with them.
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:14:26
I intend to hold the majority of it for the future, however I like to play around with the technology (such as micro tipping that isn't practical with credit cards).
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:47:01
Paper wallets do look fun. I'm just using mycelium right now with their encrypted pdf backup feature.
Looking forward to migrating to mycelium HD soon.
@_date: 2014-12-24 04:06:31
It would be cool if more wallets adopted the confidence meter that mycelium uses for trades. It takes about 15secs to get 99% confidence.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:15:20
I'm wondering this as well. The IRS document doesn't mention sales tax.
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:06:06
That's a good point. I guess we'll see.
@_date: 2014-10-07 04:33:15
Interesting. Yeah I wonder how it will play out. I was also reading about the possibility of home owners using miners for heating in their homes. You're paying for heating anyway, might as well make some of it back. Makes it worth to mine even at a negative profit.
@_date: 2014-10-10 13:57:56
I'm guessing this is in reference to  ?
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:47:43
I bought my first 0.26BTC right before it went down. Was able to send out the btc to my own wallet before it went down.
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:28:04
They advertise no fees in transactions, but how do they come up with the bitcoin price? I'm assuming they'll be adjusting the exchange rate so that they can collect a profit every time someone buys or sells btc.
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:47:38
I can still play around with 1% while I hold the 99% for the future.
@_date: 2014-12-31 22:15:18
Ok thanks for clarifying. SSS seems like a better option for this purpose so that's great.
I see the concern. Personally I would be ok with dealing with the extra caution required but it's probably better to keep it simple for the more casual home user.
Thanks for your reply. Happy new year.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:17:10
How about sales tax on purchase of bitcoin from exchanges? Selling/buying property is subject to sales tax right?
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:04:39
Are you serious?
@_date: 2014-12-31 17:08:02
Yeah not sure what happened there.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:05:51
I'm just providing info from the original thread, would need to look at the commit log to see if qr codes were there by the time of the incident.
However, if there was one person using the latest available tech for bitcoin, you would expect it to be SN.
@_date: 2014-10-10 13:58:11
I think it's in reference to 
Not sure.
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:16:42
Localbitcoin or mycelium android wallet let's you trade locally
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:44:49
I think this is the saddest part of this story. You were probably targeted because of your generosity.
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:52:52
You could send him an email with a qr code of a wallet that you control. Then when he meets with a guy from localbitcoin or mycellium, he can call you and stay on the line until you confirm the transaction. He could print the qr code as well for the guy to scan if he doesn't have a smartphone.

Goto chrome settings, there's a little search bar in the settings window. Search for "manage passwords".
If you click "show" you can see the actual passwords.
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:12:07
Well that's terrible.
Care to share some details of your setup so others may avoid your mistake?
Was he logged in using remote desktop? Do you think he cracked your wallet backup?
Do you think he grabbed a copy of your passwords from your browser saved passwords file?
How would he bypass 2FA? Were you using google authenticator?
We are all human, we make mistakes. Sorry dude.
**This prompted me to go through my chrome saved passwords.. Man that thing is juicy. Hmm..**
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:04:44
Good to know. This is really important work that will help everyone build a more secure network. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:50:02
I've bought with it before. Was quite easy.
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:14:27
I think this is my favorite. The only catch is you need to have some bitcoins already to buy some more.
@_date: 2015-05-05 13:24:50
Interesting work. Have you tested this with mycelium local trader to see if it can get around their confidence check?
@_date: 2017-06-18 10:22:42
You need to trust the computer you're generating your private key is secure and doesn't secretly send it to a pirate. Trezor generates this internally. It's hardware and firmware it's inspected by third parties and includes a bunch of security features to make sure it's very hard to comprise.
