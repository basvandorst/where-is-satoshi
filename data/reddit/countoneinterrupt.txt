That isn't necessarily true- a fork which leaves some users on Core and others on XT could tank both.  It's possible that nobody wins in a fork.

Percentage of what?
And Valve likely wouldn't make much off it (at least judging by statistics from other retailers who integrate BTC).  The Bitcoin community is small, especially in relation to the PC gaming community.

Arguably.  The hashpower is centralized in a relatively small number of miners who aren't bound by the sort of strict regulation bankers like.  Banks don't like that sort of uncertainty.
Most private blockchains actually solve the security problem by limiting who can mine / work with them.  So they're mostly just distributed databases with bonus fintech buzzwords.

If that was blatant shilling, standards have really gone down.
Just for the record, I'm in no way an ETH supporter and in fact think it's kind of shit.  An interesting idea, but I don't really see it developing into anything worthwhile.

Bitcoin hasn't gotten into the crosshairs of banks, blockchain tech has.  And VC support is stagnating.

This isn't Bitcoin winning.  This is banks using the idea of blockchains (and, given that "blockchain" is a buzzword, who knows what they actually mean by "blockchain") while ignoring Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-15 22:07:33


Not an Ethereum supporter, but this is incorrect.  ETH provides a Turning-complete programming framework that can be used for distributed computing and smart contracts.  Bitcoin's smart contract tools aren't Turing-complete.
It's not necessarily a good distributed computing platform (worse than AWS, certainly) but it does do things you cannot do with Bitcoin.  Or at least with the blockchain protocol.

Agreed.  LTC were stolen along with BTC, and the LTC price dropped by a fair margin too earlier today, despite the fact that Hearn's letter should either have a very small negative effect (some of his criticisms apply to LTC as well as BTC) or a small positive one (BTC tanking may be good for LTC).  The simultaneous LTC price drop implies that a common factor is causing the drops, and parsimony suggests Cryptsy.

These are good points, and I generally agree that modern financial systems are poisonous and toxic.
But, shy of FULLCOMMUNISM, we're rather stuck with them.  
My argument isn't that these systems are a net good or would exist in a perfect world, but that these are examples of places you can put money to have a ROI while that money has an economically productive effect, while money in Bitcoin is not being economically productive and that a widely-used deflationary currency will reduce available capital, slowing the economy.
As counter-arguments:
* Being willing to buy stocks on the secondary market keeps their value up, allowing people who bought them from the company to know their purchases will be worth it.
* There are problems with debt, but the money is still going to use.
* But the loan is allowing a person who otherwise couldn't to buy a house / make capital purchases for a business / make payroll to do that, so it is causing economic activity.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:43:45
It's not a problem with stocks, bonds, and savings- in those, the money is earning because it's serving some economic purpose (being loaned out to somebody who needs capital) and the ROI is a result of your money staying in circulation.  
A deflationary currency like Bitcoin doesn't have that utility- when your money is tied up in Bitcoin, it isn't doing anything of greater value.  That's the problem with deflationary currencies.

Could you give some more details on those attacks?  I'm legitimately curious, these kinds of things are fascinating.

It's been confirmed that good crypto remains backed by math.  The NSA is good at getting to business' private keys, backdooring software, compromising some of TOR, and tapping communication.  Well-implemented and uncompromised crypto software based on a trustworthy asymmetric-key algorithm still beats their efforts.

Because zero-conf transactions allowed some double spends before RBF.  RBF makes them less safe, but they were already unsafe.  If you're willing to trust that your users aren't trying to put one over on you, you can still use zero-confs.  And if you aren't, you shouldn't have been using them in the first place, and hopefully RBF will be a wake-up call.
Plus RBF allows for fee bidding, of course.  It's not just meant to convince merchants to use better security practices.
@_date: 2019-02-24 20:57:17
Large players (exchanges, whales, etc) are incentivized to make as much money as possible, and with fairly thin order books (easy to manipulate) and no regulatory body to stop them, can use their funds and places in the ecosystem to manipulate the market for their own benefit (ex quick price changes to liquidate shorts, tape painting, wash trading, pump-and-dump schemes, etc).
@_date: 2015-07-03 15:43:20
And if you trust the sender, you don't need the level of security Bitcoin provides.  Banks for he link, it was a good read.
I like RBF, and don't really get all the hate.  One big purpose of including RBF, as I recall, was to get merchants to stop accepting unsafe zero-confs.  Plus it makes txn fee bidding work more sensibly.

Well, of course they could have encryption, just with back doors that would totally only be used by the government.  No way are digital criminals using those backdoors- it's against the law, after all!

The spammer themself stated that they want to inform people.  They find moderation overly harsh and so want to PM people until everyone is properly informed about ETH.
It's a deeply stupid idea, for a number of reasons.
@_date: 2015-07-04 01:36:57
It increases the risk of accepting 0-conf transactions, but they are already a risk.  I'm sure that many companies still successfully hash passwords with md5, or run versions of the SSH daemon without patching Heartbleed.  That doesn't mean they should. 
I have no real problem with optional RBF- that's something we agree on, I'd support optional RBF.  However, given that always-on RBF is in the best interests of miners (as it maximizes transaction fees) I'm not convinced optional won't turn into always-on.

For one thing, lost and unmoving coins.  Imagine for a moment that all but 10 bitcoins had been lost.  Chunks of that one bitcoin are, because of low supply, worth much more.  Say each bitcoin is $100 million.
Would you then say that the market cap of Bitcoin is 100 million * 15 million, which is 1,500,000,000,000,000?  No, that would be absurd.  In the same way, the naive market cap doesn't take into account that some coins are lost or aren't moving.  It's a metric that doesn't really tell us a great deal about actual value.
@_date: 2016-05-11 18:49:53
Can we please stop treating that naive $7bn market cap as a real metric?  
@_date: 2016-05-11 22:03:20
I really don't know.  That's a question for a real expert, which I am not.  A good starting point is that, as of a few years ago, [~15% of coins had never moved](  So &lt;85% of Bitcoin created so far being priced in seems lIke a good uper bound.  How much less is a question for an economist.

Exactly, this would cost low five figures per day (plus initial capital expenditure).  It's pretty trivially within budget for a government.
