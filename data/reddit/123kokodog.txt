To be fair, although Leah might sometimes wear the same crypto-blinkers as Tone, in the 'real world' she's actually super-smart.

Thanks. Yep, I know that best op-sec is served by having the Ledger use new addresses, and it'll be something I'll go back to after December 2nd (HEX claiming day!). I'd just never come across this 'change address' feature before so, until Electrum came to the rescue, I was a bit lost. Sorted now though. Thanks to everyone who helped.

Thanks for chipping in, everyone. 
The transaction was supposed to be for 0.001 BTC. The Tx went through very quickly and the intended receiving address, previously empty (though it was one I'd previously used, I'd emptied it some time ago) shows that expected 0.001 balance. 
However, in that same Tx, a further 1.009 BTC was debited from the sending address and credited to a new unknown address. This 'new' address is not reflected in Ledger Live (which I've re-synced): the sending and receiving addresses are shown as having the correct/expected balances.
Block Explorer shows the 'new' address with that unexpected 1.009 BTC, as does Electrum ('type:change').

Sorry about this misleading title. It's kinda true - I don't know where the address came from! - but I realise it might spook people. I can't change it now. Grrr.

I'm consolidating cos addresses are getting out of hand.

How can I transfer the BTC from that new 'change' address B back to the originating address? Ledger Live doesn't recognise that new address, and doesn't even recognise (under 'Accounts) that the originating address was debited that 1.009 BTC.

Sort of! 
This intended super-small transfer was a tester in preparation for consolidating my BTC holdings into one address. But it appears that, alongside that intended transfer, it has debited a larger sum from the sending address too, and credited it to a new address.
Block Explorer shows
1) sending address debited with both the 0.001 intended and the 1.009 unintended
2) intended receiving address credited with the correct 0.001
3) new address credited with the unintended 1.009

OK, thanks. I recently bought another 1.00220155 BTC in one go, so I guess this 'break-up' is what's confusing me. What should I do to get the balance from that new address back into the original sending address?

Thanks for getting back to me. I wouldn't want to make public the Tx. 
Additional info: Electrum connected to my Ledger identifies the 'unknown' address as 'type: change'. I've not experienced this issue - whatever it is! - when previously sending BTC. 
Grateful for any pointers!
