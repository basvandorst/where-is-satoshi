Then there should be a hard fork that only doubles the block size. When your computer is slow because it's 8 years old, it doesn't take a computer scientist to figure out you need to upgrade it. If money depends on it and your computer is not even responding half the time, you can't afford it being broken, you need an urgent temporary upgrade to make it operational again until you buy a new one. Your condescending insulting tone is unwelcome and your argument nonexisting.

I believe BCH has the fundamentals, the rest will follow. I hope BTC's devs and supporters come to their senses, partly because I still have a stake in it, and party because its collapse would shake the whole industry.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:10:37
Of course not. If theoretically people stopped producing goods and services because they were hoping to live off their bitcoins, the supply of goods and services would dwindle and the prices therefore rise, devaluing the bitcoins, which would then incentivize people to start working. It's very simple demand and supply economics.

@_date: 2017-12-22 07:27:26
Like I already said in regard to that, the blocks weren't full for 4 years, they only became full in March, at which point Bitcoin's utility and market share plummeted despite crypto's growind adoption - so all those years they've been right in warning about it coming.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:02:04


The fee currently recommended by bitcoinfees.earn.com is 370 satoshis per byte, which means an average, 250-byte, transaction would cost you $15. At the height of the congestion last weekend, people reported $40 dollar transactions, which would be consistent with the 1000 sats/byte I saw on the site. It's not a long shot from a  hundred bucks, and when (and if) bitcoin's price goes up another 2-3 times and more people adopt it, hundreds of dollars per transaction can become an everytday reality. On the other hand, I highly doubt that the price and the amount of new users will continue rising at that point.

"In the 1960s and 1970s it was widely dismissed by academics. In a recent review, Irwin and Park[13] reported that 56 of 95 modern studies found that it produces positive results but noted that many of the positive results were rendered dubious by issues such as data snooping, so that the evidence in support of technical analysis was inconclusive; it is still considered by many academics to be pseudoscience.[14] Academics such as Eugene Fama say the evidence for technical analysis is sparse and is inconsistent with the weak form of the efficient-market hypothesis.[15][16]
Whether technical analysis actually works is a matter of controversy. Methods vary greatly, and different technical analysts can sometimes make contradictory predictions from the same data. Many investors claim that they experience positive returns, but academic appraisals often find that it has little predictive power.[46] Of 95 modern studies, 56 concluded that technical analysis had positive results, although data-snooping bias and other problems make the analysis difficult.[13] Nonlinear prediction using neural networks occasionally produces statistically significant prediction results.[47] A Federal Reserve working paper[19] regarding support and resistance levels in short-term foreign exchange rates "offers strong evidence that the levels help to predict intraday trend interruptions," although the "predictive power" of those levels was "found to vary across the exchange rates and firms examined"."
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:23:01
It's true that Bitcoin Cash is used less, but its 8-megabyte blocks would clear the current Bitcoin Core transaction backlog in 3 hours. It would take Bitcoin 24 hours even if no new transactions were being added. And that's forgetting about the fact that tens of thousands of transactions have been simply evicted from the mempool over the last few days.
The influx of pro-big-block posts in this subreddit started when Bitcoin's popularity spiked and congestion reached 200,000 unconfirmed txs, so based on that fact I suspect most of those people like myself are former or current worried bitcoin investors.
Centralization is less of an urgent problem than a coin's everyday basic usability, because if that goes there will be nothing left to decentralize. 
Appeal to authority is not an argument because it doesn't cite any evidence to support a claim.

@_date: 2017-12-22 08:55:34
Bitcoin Cash doesn't have the first mover advantage and the adoption, which makes it a risky investment in my view, and I regret it having split off instead of trying to improve bitcoin. Small blockers do not speak for the whole community, as evidenced by myself and many others even in this subreddit. The small block narrative dominates for now, but it is objectively wrong and is failing, as demonstrated by the reality of increasing congestion and the resulting stunted adoption we've witnessed in the past year. I'm sticking to bitcoin because I still have certainty that logic will prevail, because reality will force it to. What is it do you think I'm confused about?
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:43:45

Bitcoin Cash has increased transaction capacity and plans on increasing it further, so yeah, it does solve legacy bitcoin’s main shortcoming. Efficient mining is a crime! (not)

That would make just too much sense. When I'm looking at the backlog of 120,000 transactions that are sitting in the mempool right now, with 30,000 of them stuck there for weeks, I can't help but wonder why Segwit2X was so hated and what possibly could be wrong with raising the blocksize just a little until Lightning is actually here.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:04:34
Idk what bitmain has to do with bitcoin being broken and unusable right now, because I think the miners advocated for larger blocks to prevent this situation. But I guess they forgot to pay me, know of a way to contact them? It’s interesting that you pretend to care about bitcoin and yet you’ve switched into alts.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:42:13
My goal is convincing people that bitcoin needs to scale and to scale now. Your side of the argument seems to not want to talk about the fundamentals and throws around a bunch of logical fallacies, which is what makes the conversations unproductive and drawn out.

The fundamentals of bitcoin as a medium of exchange, which are currently broken. It doesn't matter the amount of decentralization it has if it can't work. Yes, I think raising the block size to 4 or 8 megabytes right now would not be too much of a compromise on decentralization and would allow it to still be uncensurable, while resolving the congestion and restoring the market share.


All of those are actually great points, and you've presented nothing to refute them. So I'll give you credit on making an accurate strawman this time.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:45:56
If it's that easy to attack bitcoin - and cripple it - what happens when a government - or a cooperative effort of goverments - decides to do the same?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:52:13
The 1-megabyte limitation is ridiculous and unsustainable. The mempool is now permanently at over 100,000 unconfirmed transactions and getting bigger. If a block size increase was announced today, the alts would lose half of their combined market cap to bitcoin by tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:38:55
If centralization is all you care about, maybe we should lower the block size to 1 kilobyte, so anyone can run it on a 1980 computer and  300 bytes per second dialup modem. So who cares if nobody can use it because it doesn't have the capacity to be actually operational? At least it's decentralized. You're the fkn moron and Bitcoin is turning into a shitcoin because of people like you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:57:10
If the tech doesn't allow for usability, then it's not good tech. You tried to conceal that fact by invoking mostly a theoretical tech that's not proven to work and currently simply isn't there. I guess calling me a cunt was also supposed to make up for the lack of logic in your argument.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:32:53
It can handle 8 times as many transactions per second. At least from that aspect, it is technically superior.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:15:24
It doesn't take high demand to overwhelm Bitcoin when it can only handle 3 transactions per second. Demand is subjective, it is not always a consequence of fundamental value. Bitcoin still has the first-mover advantage, and there is currently mainstream hype around it, but the high fees and long confirmation times are turning people off. Since Bitcoin's blocks became full in March, its market share dropped from 85% that month to 55% now, at one point dipping to 37%. Since other scaling solutions aren't ready, there is an urgent need to increase Bitcoin's block size. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:05:03
Deflation incentivizes people to be frugal, forward-thinking and to only make wise investments and purchases that will benefit them long-term. Frivolous expenditures are shunned in expectation of one's savings increasing in the future due to deflation. Inflation incentivizes people to blow their money on risky investments and worthless shit for instant gratification. Also gold was the standard unit of currency used to purchase everyday goods for millenia until governments perpetrated the economically destructive fraud that is inflationary fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:31:53
Assuming that on-scaling isn't better, even though it will require faster computers and networks in the future. The Lightning network isn't here. I want Bitcoin to succeed and most of my money is in it, but there are now a permanent 200,000 unconfirmed transactions and ever-growing fees, with no relief in sight. Let's talk about the Lightning network when (and if) it actually, in practice, makes bitcoin faster and cheaper to use.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:08:07
By definition that strawman is not what I'm saying as that's not a citation from me.
I first became active in this subreddit around November 12 when the transaction backlog soared to 200,000 unconfirmed txs, raising concerns and asking questions about was being done to address the issue; and then for the second time after the price had gone over 10K while the mempool became bloated again. Both times I saw an increased number of posts from people with the same concerns. That was well before Coinbase launched BCH, and I don't even know what relevance you think that has in terms of the fundamentals of Bitcoin, which are currently broken.
I define an urgent problem as a situation where Bitcoin's $40 and rising fees and several-day-long confirmation times make it impractical to use for pretty much anything for most people, which has stunted its growth and has been causing it to lose its market share, and now is obviously causing its price to plummet, threatening its replacement with other currencies. Whatever centralization that comes from raising the block size to 2mb or even 8mb is definitely not an urgent problem at the moment.
The block size wasn't full for four years. It became full in March 2017, and bitcoin's market share dropped from 85% that month to 44% now.
I'm not a programmer. I am trying to convince people of what should be done, so that the popular opinion eventually makes the devs reconsider their erroneous course of action or other devs are chosen. If that doesn't happen and the problem becomes worse, I'm going to increase the BCH and alt share of my holdings - and that's what the market has been doing as well.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:54:21

Block sizes increases have been proposed, and I'm not a programmer. All I can do is try and convince the community - like I've said before. I've also just demonstrated that the entire market isn't down by as much as bitcoin. Are you doubting that I own bitcoins? If I didn't, that wouldn't lessen the validity of what I'm saying. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:24:46
Segwit adoption is currently at 8%.  Do you think maybe there are reasons companies and individuals aren't adopting it? Are they just not aware of it and that it can make their fees and confirmation times go down?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:56:21
Am I just saying words? What does that mean? Some coins have gone up many hundreds percent in the last couple weeks alone (not to mention tens of thousands percent this year in many cases) as bitcoin is at this point only 10x of what it was at the beginning of the year - a year of roaring crypto adoption. So no, the alts are not in as bad a shape by having a panic correction now. Please face reality.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:37:46
It’s a perfectly reasonable response. Instead of engaging in bullying campaigns against other coins the bitcoin community should start asking questions about WHEN those L2 solutions are coming to relieve the full block menace. If and when they come to fruition we will have the technological advantage so we won’t have to worry about our coin’s survival and attack others. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:31:36
He's right. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:46:33
Luckily I cashed out a significant portion yesterday, but yes, I'm not liking losing 40% in a matter of a couple days - because of a technological/leadership failure that could have been easily prevented. Reality will make amends, and the block size will have to be increased if bitcoin is to stay operational at all, but the question is how much it's going to lose before then.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:35:24

@_date: 2017-12-14 13:21:42
I vehemently agree. Until second-layer solutions are actually here and working, there are only two ways the congestion can be reduced: either the block size goes up NOW, or bitcon's adoption and price go down as alts continue skyrocketing and potentially overtake bitcoin. We need to be vocal about this, this is a mortal danger. Have some gold, sir. Unfortunately, I had to pay for it with my bank card and not bitcoin. I'm glad someone brought this up and it actually made it to the first page of the subreddit, which is normally congested with memes. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:52:37
If you think the only thing that matters is decentralization, like I said, why not decrease its block size to 1Kb, which would boost decentralization? Or maybe decentralization isn't the only thing that makes a tradeable token such as bitcoin valuable, but also whether it can actually easily change hands?

Bitcoin Cash has as much of a claim to Bitcoin's name as Bitcoin Core, if not more. He never said Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core are the same thing, but leave it to a small blocker commie to call for regulation for what is supposed to be a decentralized currency. If Bitcoin is to survive, it needs to raise its block size right now, that's what you should be campaigning for, not smearing BCH.

People would still be attracted to the deflationary Bitcoin as a savings mechanism, with fiat curriencies constantly devaluating.

I agree that's a problem, and that's not how it should be. Developers should profit from their contributions as an incentive. And that's what Blockstream is trying to do, only their solutions are currently failing. Even if one is working for free but just cares about Bitcoin's succeeding, the current situation cannot not disturb them. And most of those problems would disappear if the block size was raised while BTC buys time before layer-2 solutions are operational.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:36:31
I'm on the fence, currently a panicked BTC holder. I don't think my personal circumstances are relevant to the point I raised though.


ETH's technology is flawed in that it's infinitely inflationary, for one thing. For another, because I don't want to jump into uncertainty with any altcoin, I would prefer to stay in Bitcoin and for it to scale. To my dismay it's currently broken and it's not clear to me whether viable L2 scaling solutions are coming soon or ever.

Ouch, sorry, but you shot yourself in the foot. Somalia and North Korea are poor violent shitholes for the same reason - government, aka coercion, aka violation of private property, aka socialism.

At least he's not a Marxist. All governments should be deposed though, and Bitcoin is huge step on the path toward a free society.

Guy that wants to steal 90% of some people's income and a gal that thinks "businesses don't create jobs, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise" are about as Marxist as you can get, only slightly moderated by the fact they were born in America, where calls for all-out full-blown communism still wouldn't fly with most people (yet). Their justifications for their theft are exactly the same as any communist ideologists, you must be unfamiliar with their writings?

Yes, him not being a Marxist is why it's wonderful that he won and not Bernie Stalin or Killary. But you seem to have abandoned the topic and switched entirely onto discussing my personality, like all leftist animals do when cornered.

Most governments are continuously moving to the left, Trump is no libertarian but a step in the right direction. I don't care what emotional sheeple like you think of his persona.

My argument was that Trump isn't a Marxist. But I do understand they don't teach you how to read in government schools. Why should I not use the term sheeple when it's accurate? Because you've heard your fellow sheeple make fun of it, correct?

In the vast majority of cases, your rapist probably won't kill you but just hit you and physically subdue you. The government though is not as nice as your typical rapist and if you refuse to give up your money, be it taxes or "fines", and it will eventually put you into a cage or shoot you if you resist.
The government produces nothing and everything it has it ultimately stole. It does not legimately own anything, including roads, so it has no right to collect parking fines. All the property currently controlled by governments must be privatized. When you use someone's private parking space, on the other hand, you must receive their cosent and, usually, agree to payment, otherwise you would be violating their property.

I guess if we lived in the USSR your argument would have been 'grocery stores can only exist if owned and run by the government.' Or, more relevantly to this subreddit, 'Money can only fucntion if it's issued by the government.' Mindless sheep.

When you stop stealing trillions through taxes and killing the source of that money in the process, wealth to go around (including but not primarily through charity) miraculously appears. There is nothing polite about pointing a gun at someone and stealing their stuff. That is literally the definition of being an asshole and the exact opposite of civilized productive behavior. If theft to you is a virtue, you intellecutally live in the stone age. "The good is when I steal my neighbor's cattle and wife, the evil is when he steals mine."
" In the days before social security and medicare, many old people literally lived on cat food on the street"
You mean in the days before capitalism raised income levels and standards of living by something like 30x in the 1850-1950 alone. You socialist thieves didn't create that wealth, you're simply pilfering it and taking the credit.

The idea that mass theft creates wealth for anyone long-term is caveman's thinking. If you want to help the poor, you may do so with your own money, not money stolen from others. Being charitable with other people's money is theft, not virtue. More importantly, if you care about people, you should support the system that allows and encourages them to create their own wealth rather than be dependent on handouts. Capitalism generates employment opportunities, cheap and quality consumer goods, and enormous wealth, such that even if a small portion of the rich free population gives to charity, it will be more than the state could ever allot out of the money it steals from a poorer enslaved population. 
Nobody "gives" to taxes. Taxes by expropriated at gunpoint regardless of your consent. Not everyone is stolen from equally. The more productive are forced to foot the bill for the non-productive. But absolutely nobody ultimately benefits from mass theft. It punishes productivity and rewards nonproductivity, diminishing wealth for everyone.

I was merely extrapolating on the logic of the previous poster. 
If a modification to the original bitcoin, such as adjustable block size, makes something an altcoin, then so does Segwit.
Tell me something - are you politically a leftist? That would explain the double standard and the inability to reason.

Anything that is forced is like rape. What you use the money you steal for doesn't matter.

What makes you think rich people aren't investing in crypto? Also, when capitalism implodes, you will be starving to death, so I don't recommend rooting for that.
