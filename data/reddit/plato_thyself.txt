the part that interested me was families sending funds to prisoners.  they can only use a company called 'jpay' which charges up to 40% (!) for fund transfers.  so if a mom wants to send her son $50 using her credit card, the company takes a massive cut simply to transfer the money.  
  
there were other examples of gouging, most notably charging $3 per 15 minutes on phone calls and the kickback scheme between prisons and their commissaries, which overcharge on basic foodstuffs and hygiene products.  
  
I'm not sure if prisoners are allowed to buy things from amazon, I'm guessing they are not.

There is a large (whale) seller (bear) of coins.  Large + seller = bearwhale.

surprised by this attitude.  so you're saying nothing can be done?  this is a textbook example of centralized control run amok, and monopoly power like this is exactly what decentralized currency and the bitcoin community should be fighting against.

This is the correct answer.  Not sure how anyone could take anything ZH says seriously.  It's only good for a chuckle and burning through a few brain cells.

Stefan's 'debate' with Chomsky is what caused me to believe he's not totally together and basically just doing anything he can to make money with his youtube channel.

Many people here use it personally however, so I thought it would be pertinent to the community.
