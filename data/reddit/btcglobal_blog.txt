Thank you for the analogy! It's definitely the idea.

I have appended a correction and clarification.

You are right if you took all of the sourceforge data, but the data used is year-to-date (YTD).

I think the argument works better in the following analogy:
Imagine if Torrents were heavily regulated legal entities.
Think about that for a little bit, and you realize that that even if that were the case people would still torrent however they want, except that its even more ok that it used to be.

You definitely have a point that the Bank of Thailand could seriously hamper Bitcoin. They control who has the authority to engage in monied exchange transactions and have already advised Bitcoin.co.th from doing business, and I think that's case in point.
However, this doesn't really make Thailand unique in any way when it comes to Bitcoin regulation. Most countries have taken the same approach, which is reasonably expected. It's just that the "Bitcoins banned in Thailand" news was grossly hyped and sensationalized when it didn't need to be.

The &gt;20 million cut off also excludes Uruguay, the country of BTC Global's incorporation. 
I just want to emphasize the fact that the cut offs for the data set were arbitrary and indiscriminate.

Author of the article here, George. I would just like to mention that I'm a volunteer Ambassador for The Seasteading Institute. Should be in the bio at the bottom of the article.
