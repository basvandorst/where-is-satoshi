Wirex use Segwit and Batch Processing also? how do you get 6x cheaper on-chain transactions?
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:15:13
What about a soft fork that limit non-segwit transactions per block?

"Bitcoin transfers are also irreversible, so those who inadvertently enter an extra digit when trying to pay for something are out of luck. "
What tha fuck!!! That's not true!

If you are not in a harry, you can try to transfer all the BTC to an address with a very low fee, you can try it several times, and maybe you are lucky and a miner takes the transaction and process it. You don't lose anything trying it, if your wallet lets you...
Do it during weekends, when the volume of transactions is lower.

He doesn't care what miners can do in this case. The thing is that a user that wants to run a node needs more bandwidth to verify transactions (they need the witness part). That's his point...
@_date: 2017-01-11 21:32:44
Anyone can run LN nodes, you don't need special hardware. They would not have any advantege over the rest as they do have with mining.

But difficulty adjustment occurs after 2016 blocks. So we would have an extremely slow network minging those 2016 blocks until the difficulty is as adjusted. Don't you think that is dangerous?

they will sell services needed for smart contracts, e.g. oracles. Oracles will provide the smart contracts with information from "real world": commodities and currencies prices, sports results, wheather contiotion, etc

Not so simple. Difficulty adjustment occurs after 2016 blocks

you mean lower confirmation times. Very lower, and it will result in much more than two weeks

the purpose is to make the blockchain inmutable, so nobody can modify a transaction that is under the current block...
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:56:12
I think soft fork, because with segwit they left things prepared to change signatures algoritm

In Argentina three years ago there were restrictions to buy dollars or any other fiat currency different than argentinian Peso. But a black market of dollars was created, and most of the people knew someone in the black market to buy dollars. It was (and still it is) very common for common people to buy dollars that way. The government didn't have any way to control that market. 
Nowadays it's also common to buy big quantities of BTC for cash in the same way in Argentina. 
I think that if governments insist on controlling BTC exchanges, black markets will be created in different countries, and they will not be able to control anything.
We only need some more pressure, and it will be the result.

The article is pointless. If Bitcoin market is big enough, it's not necessary to pass throgh banks or regulated exchanges, people would probably pay with bitcoins and keep them.

He means that their business is based in creating new bitcoins, so if Bitcoin price drops in the long term, their business will not go well...

Most of the trading is done with transactions off-chain.

I don't agree. It's like saying that destroying some dolar bills and reprintig them in a different color is a dilutiin of value. There is not delution ot value. It is the same quantity of bills..

Copay works with a thing called "Wallet Service": 
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:20:46
If you know the receiver ask him to send those BTC to another address of him. He have to put good fee. Another way is to ask him to send all the btc of that wallet to a new address of the same wallet...
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:30:38
No, if theres not spending transaction from an address, it is impossible to crack the private key, even with quantum computers. 
So just in case, don't reuse address...

Nowadays there is an open testing network for RSK. Some days ago I asked one of the members of the RSK team how much time we have to wait before we see RSK in production. He said that it will take about five month.

What about a bitcoin company following all the regulations to open a bank? Just to let people buy bitcoins...

it's not just a simple node. It is a Copay wallet server
