You also don't own any gold when you hold a US dollar. Not to mention when you make a bank deposit...  In 10 years these posts will seem so paranoid.

I just fail to understand how this is fundamentally different than US dollars, with the exception of a more mature ecosystem. 
Dollars are held at banks in bank accounts (read: trusted 3rd party like coinbase), secured by the FDIC (read: insurance like Lloyd's).  
Bitcoin will provide all these assurances in time. People used to store cash in their "offline" mattresses too.

Sadly it's easier to get media attention as a detractor than a proponent now, which I think explains some of the outlandish claims on Bitcoin = $0 rather than Bitcoin = moon.

Agreed. Yesterday I talked to a PM and HBS grad at paypal. While she owned 1 Bitcoin, she still admittedly "didn't get it."  Mind blowing.

Sounds like a lot of hot air

It's true, if you got a degree in classic literature and bought a house in the suburbs of Phoenix with zero money down, you are likely in trouble. Not sure how those decisions are our parents fault...

This is a valid opinion, stop down voting it. 
While i agree with the real money being out into infrastructure, it does seem strange time that all this institutional money would flow into BTC infrastructure companies to move around an asset only worth $7bn, however....

It should have happened years ago, before a massive player like Apple had the time to catch up to paypal and launch Apple pay. While none of this is directly related to bitcoin, imo paypal waiting so long to do anything innovative has opened up the market for lots of changes, including bitcoin.

I know from my work in the payments business that no legit payment processor wants to touch adult websites - tons of chargebacks and just general risk for fraud and whatnot. So I know you guys pay a ton in payment processor fees. FAR more than 3%. 
Seems like Bitcoin would have been an absolute slam dunk, and I'm surprised they have been this slow to embrace it, honestly.

Totally agree. No offense to big Vern, but he is not the "next generation of entrepreneurs" everyone talks about taking crypto to the next level. This is some hobbyist level trading platform with no institutional/VC backing. Trade at your own risk.

Why?  Your link says "nationwide", don't the big money remittance guys make their money off international remittance?

So in other words, not confusing for you and f*ck those whom it is confusing for...

Can only ctrl+z with a paper wallet. Duh. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 02:40:00
Yes yes and yes. I use coinbase being completely comfortable with it. 
THERE ARE ALSO RISKS TO BEING YOUR OWN BANK. 
Banking is hard. Stories of missing hard drives, lost private keys and BTC malware all contribute to the risks of not using a centralized solution.

True. Owning gold is great conceptually, but practically it's difficult to get your hands on a meaningful amount and physically have access to it to prepare for the zombie apocalypse.

This doesn't diminish the importance of the issue. 
All people in the BTC community right now are strong believers for it, and i would think most would not double spend as my guess is it is still quite a novelty that your business accepts BTC at all. 
As Bitcoin becomes more mainstream, people will learn that they can get free food and drink by doing this and say fuck the ecosystem. Just because it isn't a problem today doesn't mean it doesn't need to be fixed in the future. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:05:40
This sounds pretty accurate
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:44:24
This is good insight and exactly right. These transitional technologies will be very valuable for the next 10 years and are an essential part of BTC adoption. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:55:14
It doesn't have to be BTC based, and it won't be BTC based because their asset is the large number of credit cards in those accounts. They block BTC as a future competitor.

What's the benefit?  The possibility of building the next paypal, which is worth quite a bit. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:15:05
I'm aware. That's my point. USD is an IOU as well.

Google has properly conditioned me not to click the first link ever. That tiny yellow "Ad" box looks massive to me.

This is definitely true, but it's also true with the U.S. Dollar and inflation. The government prints money, and arguably no one needs to possess US dollars other than for commerce (ie no speculation is happening). Usd is used as a store of value. You earn money from your job and you have to keep it somewhere safe. Ideally, as Bitcoin is more widely accepted and used for everyday purchases, it will just make sense for people to keep a few hundred or a few thousand dollars denominated in btc around.

If only no one ever locked in a loss, everyone would always have gains!

My guess is Square will indemnify their merchants up to some dollar amount. The number of people who will go through the trouble of double spending BTC for a free fish taco is too small to be worried about it. Square can just eat the cost if it happens. Essentially it's chargebacks for Bitcoin

If you call the KKK free speech, then yes.

All credit to WSJ, they have covered Bitcoin in a relatively unbiased light for quite a while now. Good on them

Move it around a bit. Move it into cold storage then back to maybe coinbase. See how difficult (or not) that is. Track the transaction on the blockchain, see it get slowly confirmed. Send a bit to jimmy wales and his address to made a donation to Wikipedia. Put it in cryptsy, trade for some doge and Ltc, trade it back into BTC and take it out.  Buy shares on havelock, sell them, etc. 
I've done all these things and they give me confidence that the system generally works. It will cost you a bit to move the BTC around but it's a valuable education.
