Fair. And Btw I did appreciate your explanation. Sorry if that came out cocky. 
I am just annoyed when people tell us skeptics to ignore what is going on. This is everywhere and I am a market geek so of course I look at it. I have been a trader for 10 years. I get paid to run risk. 
I have watched CNBC daily for 10 years and now it’s all about Bitcoins. 
I have live through the Lehman bankruptcy and I am just warning people. This is a bubble and it will burst. I hope it does not put people on the streets like 2008 (unless they lost it all in Bitcoins in which case I would have warned them).

We are not moving on because you nerds engineering the next financial crisis with your bitcoin greed.

Owning something which goes up double digits everyday is not called “investing”. It’s called stupidity or gambling at best. 
QUIT. DREAMING. 
There is a fair concern that the mania is getting too big too fast and might end up posing systemic risks. 
Same clowns telling us current price action is OK will be crying and blaming the system when this bubble blows up.

As if investors ever "stuck together" on anything. Wake up. This is capitalism. Greed and individualism.

You need to put this on your Christmas gift list to Santa Claus. If you are long Bitcoin you probably still believe in Santa.

Billy Ray Valentine will short Bitcoin. It's Christmas time too btw.
"Hey, we're losing all our damn money, and Christmas is around the corner, and I ain't gonna have no money to buy my son the G.I. Joe with the kung-fu grip! And my wife ain't gonna f... my wife ain't gonna make love to me if I got no money!" So they're panicking right now, they're screaming "SELL! SELL!" to get out before the price keeps dropping. They're panicking out there right now, I can feel it."

Arrogance. Bitcoin nerds think they are smarter because they have made fortunes on a MTM basis riding this bubble. Greeeeeeed.

Looks like you have just invented something we could call scale down buying.

Yeah I like the short vol play here. Gives you good financing. I am on similar boat, except I had a little less luck on my Ethereum strategies but whatever... still up on it. Cryptos made me rich that's all that matters.

It's a classic inverted penis formation. At $100 you are just long and wrong.
