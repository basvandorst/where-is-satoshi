You guys make it sound like you've invested beyond your life's savings into bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:10:45
Perfect, I got moon land to sell ya.

Starting to wonder if he even sent it to coinbase knowing how much info he just put out there for us.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:55:05
Get back to me when you've moved 200,000 in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-05 18:26:33
Precisely! I think we need to keep this in mind when we make posts like these, to try and be objective about ourselves and other’s success through bitcoin.

To be frank with you guys, when I see posts like this, it makes me wonder if some of you are at least a little bit of a fanatic. You know, in a non-good kind of way. Don’t get me wrong, I believe in bitcoin, I’ve made a hell of a good living off of it. I’m drinking a $3000 bottle of wine right now to celebrate success with friends as we pass out for the night. I think the idea of decentralize currency that can’t truly be controlled by some higher power can benefit all. However, I’m not naive enough to know or not that this kind of power for an individual isn’t going to cost us in other ways.. you feel me?

Seems OP doesn’t understand how this meme works.

You guy do realize social security is a failing system and most of us won’t be able to withdrawal from it right?

For one, the production of solar panels create very nasty byproducts and are produced using some very caustic and hazardous materials. We can't just switch everyone over to solar. We still have energy storage issues as well. Batteries have a ways to go as well, not in just terms of by product waste but in efficiency as well.

So you made other people $999,999,9999 richer. Congrats.
@_date: 2018-10-01 03:26:52
Damn that's a lot of ice.
@_date: 2019-10-24 03:18:04
You'll fit right in.

But plan A was the condom. 
@_date: 2019-06-07 21:27:22
With the amount of Bitcoin large corporations and banks have purchased, yeah fucking right.

It's worth about $40. That's a series C note from 1934. Not so rare. An A and B series note would be worth closer to $500 each.

Only audi can make metal look plastic.

Here, guess which one is the plastic car, and which one is the real car.
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:37:59
There is just something about the R8 that just seems so cheap and plastic like.

That's what happens when you think you can make a quick buck off riding it out in a couple of weeks.

Spoken like someone who thinks we can survive off the current system forever.

"I like Tesla.  Tesla at any price I think is ridiculous."
Let's just eternalize that comment forever.

Since you mention it, my sarcasm is usually a hit. People tend to find me quite funny. Thanks for the compliment even though that too was a worn out tired joke.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:47:37
Well, money does tend to transcend immature and worn out “jokes”.

Find a single miner asic or otherwise that can turn a profit right now. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 19:43:38
I'm aware, this was my point originally but it seems to have gone over his head. Oh well.
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:48:18
Um no... that would take 88,000 1080tis mining for a whole day with no power consumption... smh
