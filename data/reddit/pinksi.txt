There are few reasons why: 
* We still have crisis in EU - the middle class is hurting (high taxation, high unemployment) and we just don't have spare money to invest. 
* And there is also language barrier in EU. Many small countries with different languages. It's harder to start a snowball effect.
* Different laws in each country - very problematic to have serious bussiness and actively promote. Sellers on Localbitcoins are small fishes and can't really afford to promote bitcoin like some start ups with funding in other countries.
* Many people got hurt when in 2013 the biggest EUR exchange got shut down. This were first adopters and I believe they didn't really want to promote bitcoin/ and that's why Europe is still lacking. 
* Highly socialist mentality and no real Anarcho-capitalist or Libertarian movements in EU that were/are the big drivers of adoption.

It seems you don't really understand that bitcoin at this stage is still investment in the early stage and that is the reason for volatility. You just don't admit to yourself that you are speculating and that's the reason why you feel cheated. 
Am I right?

I offer THREE bitcoins. Wait! Let me calculate first: 750k lost from costumers, 200k found, +tens of millions of custumers money. 
Yeah, I can afford to pay back 20% of bitcoins and some money to the costumers. I will still be rich.

In bitcoin world everything is risky. Today is gox, tommorow might be Bitstamp, BtcChina, Btc-e,..., who knows - this is happening quite often. As you see there were many people with a lot of money and bitcoins who still trusted Gox and way smarter than you and me and they still got goxed. 
You can say signs were apparent, but there is so much fud going on around about all exhanges that sometimes you have to disregard these informations. 
If you are an active trader I guarantee you similar things might happen to you in the future as they did to gox users on some other exchange.

@_date: 2014-02-28 17:24:43
Yeah, it's a total mess - we sadly just don't have enough info to know what exactly happened there. 
And there is a reason why MtGox is silent and won't discloce all info - they don't want to incriminate themself. However it's to late, I am sure this will take some time, but Mark is going to jail - multiple laws were broken in Japan.
@_date: 2014-12-14 12:30:59

banking sector - bitcoin will hopefully become store of value and people will save % of their wealth in it. With this banking sector won't be able to do all the shenanigans that it does now in cooperation with the goverments as leverage of banks will be reduced greatly. 
Blockchain - you are correct, this is the most promising feature, but it takes time to develop. Blockchain is could potentialy substitute part of legal systems of countries in some way (stock market, contracts, ...).
Don't forget btc is only 4-5 years old and pretty much only geeks and VC's that see potential have only started to experiment and fund first companies. Ecosystem will look nothing like this in 10 years.
@_date: 2014-03-22 18:03:08
Price indicates that majority is not very bullish. We are in a bearish market for more than 3 months, thats quite a lot. Many newcomers are panicking - they paid much higher price and in very short time they lost 50%. 
But I agree that to many people are still bullish and usually this means we are going down or sideways. Few months of going nowhere will get us on the right path :)

I fully agree with the closing down Bitcoin Foundation. I even believe they knew something and didn't notify public before Mtgox closure. They are bunch of crooks and I don't trust them, never did.

No, there is specific procedure when evidences and witnesses should be known to concerned parties. But do you seriuosly think Ross is like some godfather and mastermind that can unleash the hounds on anybody from his prison cell? Why do you think his family is trying to collect funds for his defense? 
I think he is nobody without internet and bitcoins, only example for the rest of people meddling with outlawed things on the internet.

@_date: 2014-06-02 16:20:10
AFAIK even if you contact mtgox they will not return your btc, because it is against the law. This is my presumption based on bankrupcy law where bankrupt companies have opened bank accounts even after they are out of bussiness and you lose everything if you mistakenly transfer money to this accounts.
@_date: 2014-07-08 08:13:45
You trust your goverment a little bit too much.
I don't know about this case in details, but I do know that goverment+DOJ are one slimy bitches - just check Aaron Swartz case for example. 
In order to defend from accusations from DOJ you need millions on your bank account, if you don't have enough money you better kill yourself or plead guilty.
Summary: Bitcoin is all about freedom of free trade - the best way to promote is to do free trades.
You got it wrong - reputation is not what goverment thinks about a certain subject.

This is correct. I think one reason is much less new users and the other better security options (2-fa, exchanges more careful).

Oh, common. Are you saying that government is prudent when it comes to spending of the public resources? There is money for this things.

Yes, all ATM's are like this (at least in Canada, USA). The whole procedure in order to buy btc is just stupid, but this is demanded by financial regulators.
I wouldn't trust this ATM companies with so many personal details (you have to give them everything except your DNA) and I am pretty sure there will be some major security breaches and identity thefts in not so far future.

Stability is not natural state and you can look at it as a gas station in a sense that longer period of low volatility means big move ahead (up or down).

C'mon, it's not the end of the world. Just another day in bitcoin world. The key advantage of btc that you don't have to TRUST other party, but people chose to trust Mtgox.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:25:26


It's a long story. But in short: there was exchange operating via Commerzbank (everything was legal) and since btc was gaining popularity the money flow increased and this was the reason why they informed police and prosecutor. They issued an order to block accounts till issue is investigated. And guess what - it is still under investigation.

Holding is the best strategy for noobs - trust me. There are many strategies for trading, but reddit is not the best place to seek this advice. 
My free advice, buy when there is a fast 30% or more drop in price. Sell when btc raises fast for 50% or more. But following this advice you might miss next bubble, so holding is the best.
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:29:49

Who cares about your opinion on fairness? Why don't you buy bitcoins and share them among random strangers and that will help you to achieve your goal in btc fairness. 
I hope you do realize bitcoin is against fairness, it's all about who deserve it and work for it. Bitcoin is politically neutral and this is a reason it's undermining the whole socialistic view of redistribution, because you cannot force anyone who owns more coins than you to redistribute them among the lazy and inept - you can only persuade someone who has more than you to share, but good luck with that, people aren't stupid.

@_date: 2015-01-06 09:59:57


Yes, but believe me it came with a significant cost. 


If this is true and only 19k coins are missing then Bitstamp will survive, because they have reserves and are backed by VC, however I cannot predict how this will affect decisions of their costumers in the long term and viability of the company. 
But I don't trust them anymore, but let's see what future brings... This hack raises serious questions about their security procedures and how they monitor inflows and outflows. I just hope other exchanges are watching and learning from this mistakes.

@_date: 2015-01-05 11:24:49


The sad part is that Bitstamp promised they will have quarterly audits of reserves. First and last was in May 2014. 
Why they don't keep their promise? I can only guess, but this is the reason why I moved all my money and coins from Bitstamp some months ago.
I completly agree with you - standards need to be raised.
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:34:41

He was paid off by Mark not to talk - he took the money and left. It's not moral, he is a cunt, but so are many others. 
But you can also look the other way around - if not for Mark and Mtgox bitcoin would maybe still be marginal and a joke. Thanks to his Willy bot and other things he did bitcoin got media exposure (bad publicity is still better than no publicity, I guess?).

Do you remember what happened to some exchange owners when government linked transaction to illegal activity? Coinbase need to protect itself and employees - this is additional overhead needed in order to be safe and the main reason why USA (the wealthiest and most entrepreneurial country in the world) still hasn't got a decent BTC exchange.
