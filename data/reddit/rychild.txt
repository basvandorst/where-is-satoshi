There are several crypto based lending platforms $lend and $salt come to mind. 
Stocks, bonds, commodities trading will all migrate to blockchain based decentralized systems, which will open up new markets for “average” level investors on a global level. 
Define “legitimate” business. I’m sure people thought blockbuster was a legitimate business until Netflix came along. Do you think fb, twitter, and YouTube are “legitimate”? I can name several cryptos that are poised to aggressively compete with those markets in 2018 and beyond. 
It’s a matter of time, it won’t happen over night, but if there is a demand for innovation and these “legitimate” businesses aren’t offering that, people will come together and figure out an alternative.

One way The banks create wealth is by loaning money, blockchain and cryptos will offer an alternative to this, competition is good the people will choose the winner. The banks are not too big to fail but they will not be the only choice as they are now.

I’ll probably get a ton of shit for this but I think it’s the group behind Ripple. I know I’ll come off like a conspiracy nut but here goes:  
Who wants to see bitcoin fail the most? The big banks and federal reserve. Why? Because they have had a monopoly on this system of wealth (fiat) and they do not want to loose power to a community like bitcoin. Recently they have artificially induced the market cap to go up by locking up over 1/2 the supply in an escrow account, creating a wave of fomo in the crypto sphere. Take a look at the Japanese exchange ‘mr ripple’ it is a mainly a ripple exchange where bitcoin is always trading for less than the average price (during this recent btc dip they were selling btc for less than 8k) I believe we will see further attacks fro ripple in 2018. They have ties to the government (Ben Lawsky), the federal reserve (Ben Bernenke) and large banks (chase and g&amp;s) as well as tenuous ties to google. I know a lot of people reading that are think “awesome I’m going to make a lot of money with xrp, it’s basically a sure thing with all those big names behind it.” But I’m here to caution you, xrp is highly centralized, the tokens are 100% Premined and unequally distributed and there is no cap on the supply meaning they could potentially issue another 100 Billion ripple (that’s right there are over 100B ripple in existence and there will be way more than that if they want there system to flow as planned!) Stay vigilant and dyor, don’t listen to people on the internet they could be spies like Andreas is saying.

Do you see that candle that designated the bottom in 2015? It is a red candle with a really long wick on the bottom. The long wick on the bottom signifies that the price whey all the way down to $180 and then recovered very quickly to $275. We have yet to see a candle as significant as that one yet. Remember to look for a long bottom wick and the bear market willl be ending and sideways will begin. Sideways willl last over a year and over that year corporations and big banks will throw all their money at sabotaging bitcoin, whether through market manipulation ponzi scenes like bitconnect or ripple so that the shadow governments can maintain their power over our monetary system. Good luck stay safe.

You say it like it’s a bad thing. Trump lifted serious regulation on crypto in January,
Btc wouldn’t be where it is today with out trump. Do your research, trump is not the bad guy 
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:19:20
To blame Trump for this is short sided, some would argue that the devise started when the Democratic Party (knowingly, look it up) conspired against Bernie to rig the primaries for Hillary. There are many sides to this story, zoom out for a larger perspective.
