First, coinbase price is based off of bitstamp price. 
Second, coinbase is not an e xchange. They buy from an exchange and sell to you for a small markup so that they make money.
Last, btc-e is so much lower because it is hard to get USD into accounts, especially compared to buying on coinbase.

Moneypak can not be charged back, but there are still a few problems.
1) Many people get moneypaks via ransomware, which is bad for you to be redeeming large amounts of. You will most likely get flagged as a criminal
2) GreenDot can flag your account if you are redeeming too many moneypaks that were bought from different locations, since they are not made to pay other people with as much as they are made to put money onto your own paypal or pay bills.
With that being said, if you get pictures of the receipt with the moneypak code you are pretty safe, because if you get your account locked they will ask for the zip code you bought the moneypak in, which you will have from the receipt.

You're comparing storing coins in your own wallet to changing passwords every 6 weeks?
2 factor won't help if the site is hacked and they can steal every single coin... so how about you just tell them to download electrum or multibit and store your coins in there. You shouldn't ever use a web wallet. Buy with coinbase and send directly to your own wallet

This really would not be hard to do through localbitcoins, selling coins online for moneypak, bank transfers, etc.

Do it up! Just make sure you use a service that converts the coins to  USD right away. You don't want to sell lots of inventory for coins to drop in price and then lose money. (Assuming this is your plan. If you want to hold onto coins no one will stop you either)
But other than that there is nothing wrong with accepting coins.

The circumstances behind this rise are much different then in the past IMO.

@_date: 2013-11-23 03:56:01
It depends how much you have. If you have a good amount that you are planning on holding onto for long term then definitely have two separate wallets.
Or, even though I advise against using web wallets, I find it ok to store small spending amounts in sites like blockchain.info 
@_date: 2013-10-19 17:16:35
I'm currently thinking similar to that.
I was supposed to receive a payment for $1200 when the price as at ~$125. Well the guy was late so how he wants to pay me now. 
With my luck the price will drop in a few days and I will lose a few hundred dollars in the process.

It was a prank by a staff member. Wasn't even an actual hack
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:00:06
I'm with you brother. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:43:53
The guy said he didn't. Said he bought it without leaving his basement
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:00:54
Really? Bitcoin hits the alltime high and so does mBTC? That seems strange
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:53:09
Maybe do a trade at 
Buy a moneypak at walmart or something next time you are there and then do an exchange with that for btc.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:46:52
Everyone says they never lost a bitcoin until they are hacked and they lose them all...
I'm on phone now so I can't link to guides but using an offline wallet like multibit is the best choice.
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:38:39
It's based off of the bitstamp price. It's usually like around 2% higher if I'm not mistaken
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:45:07
Your way is fine if you just have like $100. I wouldn't trust any more in a web wallet
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:10:36
So you don't have any bitcoins? Why is this worth a thread?
@_date: 2013-10-04 12:01:10
Confirm or deny the "hack" is just a prank.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:27:55
You need to verify your account with a visa credit card, but I think purchases come from your bank account only
@_date: 2013-10-17 20:20:59
Nothing new here... you should have known not to use mtgox to withdraw money
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:36:26
I wish I could join a credit union, but my local ones suck.
The websites look like they were made by a kid in middle school and they have typos everywhere.
I would not trust them with my money

Cloudflare won't help if they already have your servers ip

People who had this problem said to try diff address variations.
So if you live at 123 Main Street also try
123 Main St
123 Main St.

I've lost 22 in a row at 49% on just-dice before.
Technically each roll has the same % of winning so it's not really that crazy to get these streaks

Same here man.
I have one place to buy, but it has 20% fee and I am not liking that.

Gift cards can be carded, which causes the funds to be taken off the card after a week or so.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:18:26
From what I know the main reason for the price increase is that the chinese have been getting into bitcoin VERY heavily lately. They are investing pretty big in it right now, in both coins and bitcoin related businesses.
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:06:29
It's more expensive because it is not an exchange. They buy from bitstamp and sell to you.
You pay a premium to be able to easily buy coins in the US, because without coinbase it's a major hassle.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:10:01
You don't buy bitcoins at blockchain, it is just an online wallet. 
So yes, you would buy from coinbase and transfer to blockchain. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:47:17
I'm thinking maybe it only counts you as at that address from the age of 18 on?
So say if you are 20 you would only be there for 2 years in their eyes?
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:58:33
The price changed like $40 in the past week. That is definitely not somewhere you want to store all of your funds.
@_date: 2013-10-17 15:03:42
:( another one bites the dust
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:59:46
Idk how I feel about this.
It seems cool until the price drops a significant amount and you are out of the money you needed to pay your rent.
@_date: 2013-10-04 19:45:26
Must just be bad timing.
Also what did you do to get silver membership? I've made many transactions and am still bronze
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:38:46
I'll take middle management talking about bitcoin having positives over them just blasting it due to CP and drugs for the entire time.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:31:01
Same could be said to you
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:43:39
1. You can send money more than once to the same address. I'm assuming it stays the same on wikipedia since it is a donation and you are not buying anything. If you were to send money to a merchant for an item each user would be given a separate address for each transaction.
2. Receiving is where you want people to send coins to.

How does using this instead of a password change how you ban people?
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:36:50
It also gained a shitload of money in a few days.
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:04:11
Don't think it has any effect.
Ransomware has been going on for a long time, did it make the USD worth more?
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:13:30
ha i'm with ya man. hopefully it works out
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:45:24
I'm from PA and never bought a gun before. Can you just purchase one right thru you, or do I need some sort of permits first?
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:17:03
Same here brother. 
About to get myself a note 3 for christmas
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:38:09
I feel great when it dips because it is just a good time to buy up some more :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:51:43
Paypal can be reversed, pretty sure bitcoins aren't allowed to be sold through paypal so you are risking being limited.
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:24:24
I think a/the forum needs to switch it up a bit. Instead of doing the usual user/pass thing link a bitcoin address to each username. Each time you will log in with a signed message.
This way if db is compromised there are no complains of peoples money getting stolen off exchanges and such
@_date: 2013-10-16 21:46:23
I'm sure he does it free. He gets publicity out of it
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:28:52
If I were you I'd start a new reddit account.
It seems like too much but it's not good for people to know you have this. Months down the road someone will still be trying to get you to go to infected links trying to get your wallet.
@_date: 2013-07-05 17:21:25
IMO for every person who doubts there is also someone who will want to get in.
As long as you show good proof and everything you should be able to get investors.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:55:05
Buy/sell on an exchange just like anyone else

Alot of people have believed(before this went d own) that there have been two DPRs. At some point the original DPR sold the site/transferred ownership to the second.

I think something is up with their staff right now. I made a ticket the other day and it hasn't been responded to yet either

Sucks that I was owed a payment around the time of the SR drop and the person isn't paying me until tonight.
Price rise is fuckin me again

I usually get my coins after 10-15 minutes

Usually if you mail support after this email they will still let you buy the coins for that price.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:18:30
It really isn't too risky, unless you one of the VERY top guys.
Most of the lower/middle guys are at no risk for the most part.
