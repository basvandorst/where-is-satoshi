@_date: 2017-12-22 07:52:56
A moment of silence for this guy
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:29:35
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:09:07
Why ? It’s going to drop to $3k anyway
@_date: 2018-06-14 07:09:18
You can’t buy coinbase index funds though on public exchanges

@_date: 2018-06-14 01:06:06
Accredited investors only... keep the rich rich and the poor poor. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:13:04
They are saying I’m out but the btc price continues to rise lmao
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:56:46
Please stop comparing Bitcoin to a bubble. There are only a limit number of Bitcoins in circulation. After that there will be no more Bitcoins created. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:55:19
Who cares about Bank of America? I never use them, they don’t even exist to me.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:59:25
Start claiming on those faucets
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:54:20
Only difference is if you held bitcoin you have immediate access to your funds vs having them hold it till you retire. I rather be rich quicker then waiting for retirement. Plus you can’t trade alt-coins with Roth.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:06:06
He will post the video here?
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:16:54
Wdf did I just watch?
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:55:18
Enjoy your meal
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:11:27
Hahahaha 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:08:11
That’s old news. Bitcoin almost at $10,200
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:08:54
You sold right when bitcoin is about to go mainstream. You never sell Bitcoin. Anyway good luck with your venture.
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:57:36
You should’ve waited. This is going to $3k
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:47:45
Hahaha so true!
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:46:35
Make a song about Tether!
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:34:45
Their loss. Bitcoin is the future.
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:43:03
Bitcoin will never be the same again. China was a big player. Realize price won't move up anymore
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:14:33
At least someone knows the value of bitcoin. Obviously not china.
@_date: 2017-09-22 01:56:05
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:19:09
Means death
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:03:22
This guy should retire and let the new generation lead
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:35:45
Lmao so true
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:55:43
I like it though. Nice job
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:40:09
Had a huge argument supporting my case. Friend said it won't even reach $25k I recorded his voice I'll show it to him lol
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:53:52
When you start developing this for the iPhone then we will talk.
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:09:46
Bitcoin is a bubble that's why
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:55:25
It will reach 3k easily. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:09:19
Keep holding. It's really obvious this coin is going to rise do to the recent news. Also other alts will sky rocket. Not as high as btc but they will
@_date: 2018-04-08 22:54:50
It was a smart move for a few hours lol.
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:22:16
Price will be 10k this year [personal speculation following the news]
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:58:17
F u
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:45:06
Great news in general. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:29:36
Can't believe btc is destroying itself... there was no need for all of this august nonesense. It was continuing to rise now it's falling.
