Just like Marx, Freud, Kant, or Adam Smith, Ayn Rand has some good things to say and some insane things to say. But just like the people who read into Marx so much that every problem can be forced into a 'class-warfare' mold, if you become too much of a Randian, it would make sense if you became blind to the idea that people could even have the *capability* of being altruistic.

I was so astonished that he couldn't realize that somebody would post without either trying to join him or destroy him. Apparently, the idea that people are even slightly altruistic was inconceivable. 
Is this what happens when you read too much Ayn Rand?

Or rich relatives! Don't forget rich relatives!
Although it would be debatable as to whether that should be considering *making* money.

Almost the same position as you. Think I should buy more?

First thing I thought of when I saw that was 'I wonder what kind of deal I would be getting, seeing that I got my Bitcoins at about 1.50 to the USD.'
A few minutes later, 'Oh god, I'm doing price comparisons on Depends Adult Diapers'

That's actually part of the Dunning-Kruger effect as well. It's a combination of both being too stupid to realize you're stupid and being too smart to realize you're smart (more or less. It's slightly more complicated than that)
The 'opposite' that the article mentions is the idea that the East Asian subjects are very quick to see their own failings. It didn't mention if East Asian subjects who are competent are quick to see their own competence as well, though.

Just bought some at ~29, so...damn well I'm holding!

I'm curious, how do you buy and sell your bitcoins?

What do they use them for?

Actually, it was Thomas Jefferson that first proposed decimalizing the dollar, back in 1784.

There've got to be a bunch in Thailand, and it's not that hard to get there from Laos. Vietnam, as well. That's probably his or her best shot.

It was the Spanish Dollar then. The US adopted it before starting to print its own dollars. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:37:23
Yep. It was pretty much the premier international currency at the time. Spanish Dollars were still legal tender in the US all the way up to 1857. Up until the 1800s or so, the idea of "one country, one currency" wasn't really solid.

lady, chick, girl, woman, etc...
If you're referring to someone as a transgender MTF person, you're by nature referring to them as female - what you wrote is the grammatical equivalent of saying "The guy on the left is an actress."

Ah, I was just wondering if they were using them in any interesting and unique ways, like how in Kenya, they're working on integrating them into M-Pesa and making it international.

Oddly enough, the US was one of the first countries to decimalize their currency (as our currency was decimal from the get-go) - the only country with a decimal currency before the US was Russia. The UK didn't decimalize until 1971.
