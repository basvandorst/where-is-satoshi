Brilliant thread OP, keep up the authentic and insightful content I genuinely enjoyed reading this as I'm slightly unknown to mining formalities. Your English grammatical skills seem on point, keep it up time is the best catalyst, an abnormal topic to speak on for sure.  I think your conclusion is on point and some new rouge experimental ASIC tech is on the horizon but perhaps it may not be Bitmain, let's hope anyways I want to see that top spot conquered sooner or later.

Expect some dumping tonight. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:07:49
Wait for the Chinese to rise and then shall talk. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:31:00
Some pumping followed by some heavy selling in my opinion

lel you fo real?

I believe much more is to occur, look back to the previous dip we went from 2,500 euro to 1700 euro. At the moment we haven't dipped as much but I do believe when the Chinese wake, there will be some serious dumping. With one of the exchanges to announce a closing, panic will spread as other exchanges may follow.

I have just observed some proper dumping at the early hours of the morning just 2 days ago before this dip. I believe it's gonna happen again out of FOMO, there will be some more sorts of negativity towards BTC tomorrow via news. That may induce more panic.

They were but the word may have not spread across to the majority of the BTC holders. It is the middle of the week after all, people need to work. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:03:37
3750 is my target 
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:34:35
Got 0.1 for the portfolio

Under 3k I believe would be doubtful on 2k unless the whole market panicked. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:33:48
All done :D
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:41:27
Yes i do think we are nowhere near this crypto bubble bursting, not yet I believe BTC will be back booming come Christmas aka above 5k.
