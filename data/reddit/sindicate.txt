SegWit = lightning = much less on chain transaction = less money for miners. Miners only care about their bottom line and not bitcoin users who want faster and cheaper transactions

Every ecosystem with misaligned incentives amongst participants is bound to fall in this kind of trap. Mining is a bad idea because the miner's incentive is not aligned with the bitcoin users

This works if only solvent, responsible entities invest in bitcoin when shit hits the fan.... the reality now is entirely different. Its shady, almost bankrupt hedge funds that invest in btc.... whats gonna happen when the rest of their portfolio goes south? They’re gonna need to cash to cover and sell their btc. A good idea but implementation relies on “good use” of something completely unregulated.... it requires a global consensus that bitcoin will become the safe haven. That being said i think its a much better alternative than gold but again that doesnt mean the financial community will agree.

Negative interest rates could be a good thing for new homeowners,  providing banks dont give out cheap negative second mortgages only to millionaires but we have to figure out how to live with less, we can’t have the upper middle class building mansions and buying ferraris while poor people are living like cockroaches with no growth in the economy. On a macro scale, we need the economy to slow down to tackle overconsumption and pollution. Problem is not negative interest rates but reallocating ressources in a world where growth is slowing. Lots of people seem to think ubi is the solution but i think practically it only works for a few countries like Norway etc... real problem here is upper class is addicted to growth... they literally need it more than the poors and thats fucking a lot of things up in developed economies

The reserve fee schedule is set by consensus of the nodes collectively operating the network.
The reserve is calculated as the: 
account_reserve + owner_reserve * owner_count
The owner_count is the number of ledger entries attributed to the account. This is a count of the number of open offers and non-default trust lines attributed to the account.
