A major point of it is that you don't need a bank for the transaction.  The exchanges like coinbase are popular but all you really need to do is find someone willing to send you some for something you are able to offer to them.  The two of you can then transact directly.

I suppose so.  Still you only have the one USD/BTC trading pair with the added variable of the GBTC premium.  I see it's value as a long term HODL platform.  For frequent trading the endless trading pairs on cryptoexchanges have the advantage, imo.  That's not to say you can't make a ton of bank frequently trading GBTC.  The extra volatility of the premium can be an advantage vs just trading BTC/USD on something like gdax.

I have a small percentage of my 401k in it, but other than tax advantaged accounts such as that I think it should be avoided.  Much better to buy BTC directly.

$60/day presently.  It increased over the last few days due to the block times correcting.

You should absolutely be able to recover what you are owed, I would move really fast on this and be at a lawyer's office trying to get his bank to lock down those funds until this can all be sorted out.

sorry man.  FYI I think you can also make multi-signature wallets where more than one party has to sign off to create a valid transaction.

I could be certainly be wrong, I have less information to form my assumptions on than what you have.  I was just trying to give an unbiased view from outside of the situation based on the few things I did know about it.  If it is true then I’m sorry for your loss, sincerely.  Even if it is not a con however it is still a theft.  You can certainly empathize with your friend’s situation and choose to forgive it.  I personally would never use the loss of a loved as an excuse to steal from someone, and I doubt that you would either.  For your friend a personal crisis means that it is ok to steal.  That’s not good.

Exactly.  Between that and no contact I’m 90% sure OP has been conned.  I had a 1st cousin that was also a best friend since childhood just up and con me one day.  Maybe I’m a cynic but the timing and situation of the ‘emergency’ just seem designed to allow OP's friend to have time to get the money out of country and harder to recover.

The reason to involve law enforcement is to lock down the funds so that it will eventually be recoverable.  Your position is actually much better than if he had withdrawn crypto to another wallet.  Then he could destroy the private key out of spite if you involved the law/courts.  Since it is at a bank it can be frozen.

It smells like a con.  You don't steal $65K from your good friend because your wife died.  It sounds like an excuse entirely designed to elicit an emotional response from OP.  That's how con men operate.  There probably won't be a fake funeral, but there will most likely be people or assets leaving the country.

It's an estimation for how attractive your transaction is to miners

same.  I have gbtc in my 401k but don't have any in my regular trading account.  I do also hold btc directly.

Yeah they could have had a common wallet the pool paid to that required both to approve withdrawals which should have been happening regularly to their own private wallets or exchange accounts.  But even without multi sig they could have insisted on monthly splittings of the joint account to minimize risk of one of them screwing the other.

Give us an update.  I'd personally go ahead and assume the person who is supposed to be my friend and partner that stopped communication and abruptly moved a large asset we hold in common is trying to steal from me.
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:43:05
The main problem with your set up is that you should have had a common wallet and each had your own private wallet with regular withdrawals to the two private wallets.

Best wishes to you man.  You’re obviously a very generous person.  I think you should probably be more proactive in protecting your own interests when it comes to mixing business and friendships, but a lot of that stems from my own experience in getting burned by someone that was both a very close friend and closely related.  It was out of the blue.  Over the next week or so found out like a dozen other family and friends had also been ripped off, and then he skipped town for like 6 months.  It was drug related and nobody suspected that he would just straight up con you until it was too late.

I’m sorry man but he stole from you.  If you want to be ok with it and call it a gift or whatever that is your prerogative.  I am entirely skeptical of the story but even if it is true he stole from you.
