Translation: Jim agrees there is a serious bug that won't get resolved any time time soon. Sorry to say, but I won't use or recommend Multibit again.

Yep the withdrawal fee works out at $10AUD in total.

It sounds like you think it's all from one one person. This is highly unlikely. Lot's of people bid in precise multiples of one dollar.

Sure. no problem. [Link to virus infected client that will send all ur coins to me](

And I should be all in favour… in fact I am convinced that we shall never have decent money again, before we take from government the monopoly of issuing money, and allow competing institutions. Of course under different names, not issue the same money, but competing monies, and let people decide which kind of money they prefer to use.  






Me too.

It shouldn't be a problem for now, but you never know what could happen in the future and what other purposes the list be used for.

Same message, but on a different occasion:

I think this is a good answer. When I first heard of BTC I also searched for formal models produced economists but it seems there is little interest. Do a  search through for the word bitcoin and you will see it's not on the radar.

Probably just people cashing in/out large volumes. Have a look at the minute 20:46 AEST High=155, Low=148 Volume 4628. That happened in 60 seconds.

It's not "its", it's "it's". As in "it-is" = "it's"

Too bad if your name is "Joe Bogus" and you like in "Fake Main Street" in "Completely Made Up City, New York."

very large volume atm. someone wants some bitcoins, so they pay the price

In Australia you do need to do most of the things he listed (you could skip the trust I guess). That's just how it is here. I've had to do most of the paperwork he listed myself. I was an ongoing pain in the ass.

Perhaps orders that are not in USD are processed differently. Just a guess.
