For Galapagos you have 2 options. The most common one is to take a cruise among the different islands of the archipelago. This is a bit expensive but will make it easy for you to take care of an infant. The second alternative is to take a land tour. Is cheaper but involves walks and activities that will be a bit difficult for children under 8. Of course you could take it easy and just enjoy the beach and the ocean. Your family will love the nature; most local wildlife, not having natural depredators are unafraid of humans around, so is common to have a sea lion taking sun next to you at the beach. Here is a sample invoice I prepared for you to show your our current integration:  
values are just examples and do not represent the actual costs of the services.

The cost around January and February receives lots of visitors specially from Argentina. Montañita is a great place to party at the beach with these beautiful girls! Now that we have integrated our payment system; the next step is to work with our providers to start paying them in bitcoin. I plan to offer to pay a small part of their invoices with it, I think once they see the benefits they will want to have most of it instead.
