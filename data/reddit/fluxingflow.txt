Investment rule  Diversify. Balance holding over stocks, bonds, fiat, real estate, crypto, etc.

So you don't have any money. Can't invest without money bruh.

Surviving through every crash helps crypto gain greater confidence.

Then diversity through Vanguard mutual funds. With that you can own over 1000 stocks with as little as $1000. Annual management fee is around 0.05%.
Honestly, if you can't afford to spread your money around, crypto is not the game for you. New markets need patient investors, and nobody is more impatient with getting rich than poor people.

Well branding does matter in crypto like everything else. Why would people buy something that has no reputation?

I wonder what percentage of people would trade the convenience of civilization that comes with rules and extra fees for the freedom and dangers of the wild west. Perhaps like the internet age, we experience a boom-bust cycle and then serious development happens after.

Lol, bitcoin is fiat with a hard cap in supply and decentralized miners. The only thing backing its value is people's faith.

Price acceleration over a year is more extreme for Bitcoin.

Fuck. 2017 Bitcoin boom makes 2000 dotcom boom look like child's play.

Bitstamp is a European exchange that supports trading in BTC, LTC, ETH, and more.

Dude, did you compare the charts between the two? Bitcoin blows late 90s out of the water. It's like all that speculative capital that was distributed across a whole class of random tech companies is now collectively in one stock. Maybe that will keep this one stock going longer, but it might eventually break the camel's back.
Remember, earlier birds like Yahoo! and AOL eventually became shit and then Google and countless others thrived after the crash. I believe there will be a lot more investing opportunities to come for blockchain and cryptocurrency. This is only the beginning. The greatest thing Bitcoin can do is get the news out and attract innovators and users.

There's one enormous search engine - Google - and a few small competitors.
There's one enormous desktop operating system - Windows - and a few small competitors.
There's one enormous social media platform - Facebook - and a few small competitors.
The one-big-few-small pattern certainly applies to crypto at the moment. I don't see any competition for Bitcoin that would change the pattern.
