Did nobody in this thread see that the post on the left says "1 month from now" 
This is supposed to be a parody of the whole divesting post due to the fact that bitcoin adoption is growing.

Obviously the most important question here.

The format or authority of an argument is inconsequential as long as you take the time to hear it out and actually give it a chance before passively dismissing it by giving into your own cognitive biases while mentally stagnating.
If you refuse to listen to reason whatever the format, you are simply limiting yourself, and showing others that you are not worth the time.
So, give reason a chance, whatever the format may be, or enjoy a life ignorance. Your choice, really.

Read it, as well as many of Rand's works. In fact I used to be a staunch objectivist just like you. Then I actually used my rationality. 
Objectivism is wrong all the way down to the metaphysics. Reality is Real. A is A. I think therefore I am. The three axioms of objectivist metaphysics. Let's prove the first, Primacy of Existence.
Reality is real, because if it weren't it would be impossible to make any statements of logic in the first place, and without logic any argument using rationality is invalidated. But wait! This axiom begs the question, it presupposes rationality. 
This is fine, but no objectivist likes to admit this, because it means their axioms aren't in the correct primacy. In fact they aren't axioms at all, they are theorems based on one axiom, that Rationality is Real. 
So if rationality is our prime axiom, then that means that deriving epistemology from metaphysics is in fact circular logic, meaning that your epistemology isn't an objective fact of the universe, but presupposed from your arbitrary choice of theorems that you have falsely labeled as axioms.

It's not simplified whatsoever. Demand is created by subjective value from a collection of individuals. Supply is created due to subjective valuation of whatever goods the demand offers in exchange. Use cases may contribute to an individual's valuation of a currency, but not every person values the use cases equally or even at all.

All value is subjective. It's worth exactly as much as you think it is worth.

That is a completely dogmatic statement without any argument to back it up. Try again.

Probably not, but many people get lured into the false safety that 'open source' means, 'free of malice.'
Every person who goes over the code for Bitcoin is doing all of us a favor.

I'm making the case that the dollar will be abandoned before it get's to hyperinflation.

What has he done exactly? As far as I can tell, he offered a service where people can voluntarily share files, and then encouraged people to pay for a better version of this service. There is nothing wrong with this.
