Like all noobs and sheeple need to know, you only lose if you sell. yet it matters not because like all the other filth, you will disappear into your new FUD  sock-puppet account, when a new ATH has been attained. 
However! this time Wall Street bubble will have imploded and the fiat carnage will be biblical, and reverberate from, stocks, right through to the property market. 
See you back at $40,000.

Paul the exit is that ��

I know it's frustrating ;-) the only saving grace, if they have to FUD that hard means they're desperate. I've been a HODLER since 2012,
and seen this shit multiple times in different forms. ;-) 
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:42:59
The MODS have banned most of the HODLERS on my list.
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:07:24
Not only will this be removed, you will be banned by the reddit admins.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:16:40
Funny, that's the same answer that people give, who hang around outside school yard gates.
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:08:33
The problem in r/bitcoin is that MOD's will allow FUD that attacks Bitcoin and it will remain, but you will get banned for your heated response, it's FUBAR.
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:11:33
17 Satoshi is not 17 Bitcoin, maybe you're confusing your **-18 Comment Karma**, keep taking the meds.
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:55:51


Yep! that about sums it up.
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:13:40
You were never loved, i'm sorry for you, it's not to late, there's more to life than being a troll.

Bank of America, is that still a thing?
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:37:26
Is it that time already, suicide FUD? of course the first comment in response to this OP is a brand new reddit account give it a break it's boring!!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:45:10


**Hell no!**
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:19:43
You're a fucking idiot troll, that's why your post is removed.
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:47:27
**BLACK MONDAY** is coming, HODL onto your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:17:29
You're trolling with several sock-puppet accounts, get a life.
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:13:38
I bet your jacket buttons up from the back? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:26:44
You sound fickle, but do what you wish with your $100.
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:03:18
You collect Karma? here you go haha!
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:43:46
That's the point, troll makes OP , and troll answers, r/bitcoin is under a heavy FUD campaign, but be careful how you respond because they have an inside MOD that will ban you.

@_date: 2018-02-03 10:49:51


The real question is,...
**Why are there so many reddit accounts here that are only a week or two old that post just FUD and disinformation, to pump other coins?**
**In fact why do the MODS allow all these FUD post to remain in the r/bitcoin sub especially the ones that support the corrupt establishment banking narrative, which I note is imploding?**
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:00:24
I get it you were never loved or you're lonely, so you crave any attention from trolling, and it's is a win win for you, even if people call you out for the cunt that you're. People with your mind set normally hang around outside school gates, or troll reddit subs to cause discord, keep taking the meds sicko!
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:52:25
You're one of the worst FUDDER'S in the r/bitcoin sub, how the reddit admins and MODS allow you to spread such hate and discord, is an embarrassment to this platform.
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:46:55
**You haven't lost that $100 until you've sold.**
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:23:22


The best thing you have posted, PS....stop being an online arsehole.
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:57:18
Why the hell is this OP FUD allowed to remain and not removed? where are the MOD's?

The disingenuous reporting, whilst accumulating cheap Bitcoin in the same breath.
I kinda feel sorry for those Joe Public weak hands that sold.
