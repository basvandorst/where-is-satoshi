People have a hard time in general, understanding that some people have trouble gaining weight just as some people do with losing it. I understand this because I have a close friend that’s been skinny and struggled with it his whole life, and I’ve always been fat. He doesn’t like to be called skinny and in general, people think it’s okay to call a person skinny. They don’t see it as an insult in the same way as calling someone ‘fat’ is. He could kill a person for them saying, ‘just eat more’ or ‘you need a sammich’.

Are you trying to talk everyone here out of buying crypto to hold? 
I know many people make money with stocks, holding, day trading and going the stock option route. 
Investing by definition is 'expend money with the expectation of receiving a profit'. 
There's a million ways to make money, you can call it whatever you want.

You should tell that to my friend that got me into it. He added $150,000 to his retirement by selling BTC that he bought when they were just a few hundred dollars for one. He sold 100 once they were at $2500, never thinking they would go over $4,000. Luckily, he still has around 100 BTC and he still regrets cashing out the other ones. He has made a huge amount of profit with a very small investment.
