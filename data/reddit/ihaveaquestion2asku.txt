AMEN! I can only install 4. I guess they want us to buy multiple devices. Screw that. I'll do something else.

Yeah, that's what I did. I was on the legitimate Poloniex site. After I sent the coins from Coinbase to Polo, I went back to the Poloniex site and refreshed the page with the deposit address and a different BTC address, than the one I transferred to, appeared. I then went to highlight that address and before my eyes, it changed to yet a different BTC address. I then went to the Coinbase page and looked at the page that showed every BTC address that I had ever used, and low and behold, every address it showed was the original bogus one. Refreshing that page caused them all to change to something else. I knew I done been got at that point.  
I guess I was totally oblivious to the possibility of the actual text on a webpage being changed. Well, I've now learned not to trust anything, ever, when it comes to money.  It was an expensive lesson, but it could've been much worse.

You and have got me thinking. Maybe use an airgapped Linux box to sign transactions and somehow securely take that to my Windows machine? That's probably overkill, though. Do you think a laptop with Linux installed and connected to the internet would be sufficient security? I'm not familiar with how vulnerable Linux is to stuff like malware and viruses anymore, but it's software and software can be jacked with.
