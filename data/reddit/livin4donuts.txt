I bought 5 back in like 2011 and sold them in 2012. Kicking myself right now, but such is life.

Am American. Aluminum is how everyone here says it, but Aluminium makes more sense because 1) it's how everyone else says it, and 2) its more consistent with the other elements.

Yep, this. Now they're damn near unstoppable and to be honest it's getting old. For fucks sake let the Bengals win or something.

Property taxes are high because we have no state income tax or state sales tax except on a few things. Also, mad cheap booze and fireworks if that's your thing.

I've been there. Currently I'm renting until this shitshow dies down some. I got a great deal on a place through a friend of the family, actually the same real estate office that my wife and I were looking to buy through, although a different agent turned us onto this place.
But you're right, everything is either insanely expensive, immediately taken, or a complete dump that needs professional rehab. I've done rehabs before and it's not a problem, but if you're trying to live there the place needs to at least be habitable and that's not the case with what I've been seeing.
