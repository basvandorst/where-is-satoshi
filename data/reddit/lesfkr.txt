And im pretty sure 100% BTC will never be mined. It'll stop at between 95 to 100%  mined but of course none of us will live to see that day =(

Why everytime it reaches 1000$ these central banks start releasing caution notes about BTC and they don't care when it's below 1000$. F U bankers

So you wana start a shrine and everyone worship you because you got pepper sprayed? What else a racist should expect? You had it coming. That's the reality of USA now. It's white racists vs non racists.

This country will prove to be a test case on how bitcoins will save your ass during a financial or political crisis. We need to study more about the current scenario with bitcoins in Venezuela n follow it closely. Bitcoin can completely replace the traditional banking system in Venezuela.

The more money flows in btc. The more the price rises. BTC community has to do more to allow people to invest in btc. Right now it's fucking hard to purchase bitcoins. What kind of fking global currency it is which AFTER 7 years of its inception is still pathetically hard to buy outside of USA or EU. I first bought Btc 7 years ago.  N it was extremely easy. Now the trend is complete opposite. We need to worry about this shit MORE than god damn SW.

We all need to thank China for it don't we? For putting a leash on margin/fake trading so fake volumes are gone. Good for BTC in long term.

Miners need to know that they can't mine unlimited and ruin bitcoins. We don't want bitcoin to behave like another fiat currency but more like gold. Demand always way higher than supply

They hv been around for a while but beware of their exchange rate. Confirm it before toy purchase esp with your credit card

This issue would be resolved tomorrow if running full nodes will be compensated in the same way as miners, paying the fee for the confirmations. Im willing to run 10 full nodes if that happened.

Why is it scary? Who gives a fk what he says? It's not like he can change the limit to 41 million bitcoins if he thinks. Or can he?

These features don't add to the value. You can buy portable fiat money (eg $) and government can flood the market with printing 5 trillion billion dollars next day and portability won't add rats shit to the value. The basic economic principal is supply and demand not portability or any of the in your list

Quit misinterpreting what's written. It only talks about a bug n it was fixed so btc won't exceed over 21 M. The limit was always there. It's a mathematical limit. Wtf is up with people talking about limits all of a sudden? Some greedy ass people aren't happy with bitcoins halving and only want their mining operations to go on till the day of judgement. Not gonna happen.
