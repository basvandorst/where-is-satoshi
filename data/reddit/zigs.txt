Why do you want Bitcoin? To be rich?
Many of us actually want to improve the world.

It does seem that way.
However, how do we know that OP isn't BFL trying to scam more?
@_date: 2013-08-21 15:30:00
Can you go into details why? I'm very curious about it.

**Guys, can we not downvote this guy. Disagreeing is not a reason to downvote, being irrelevent is. This is a very relevent opinion, though I do disagree with it as well.**
Ok, so bitcoin is basically demand and supply. If bitcoin was down to a nickle all of a sudden, many people including myself would go on a bezerker rage buying bitcoins. Personally I would go as far as attempt to take a loan in a bank to buy bitcoins.
This would drive the price back up, because as people buy, the supply goes down and the demand increase, increasing the price.
So imagine that it goes down slightly more, say to 80 USD. I would think "wow, this is probably a good time to buy bitcoins - it's going to increase again, I'm certain enough on that, that I'm willing to spend some money." This would result in the same effect as the above, though not as extreme.
Edit: In a sense, bitcoin is fueled by the idealism of the people using it. More people are joining in each day, and as a result, the potential grows and grows.
@_date: 2013-07-04 09:36:55
Please god, yes!
I want to buy.
@_date: 2013-06-28 10:51:12
Well, I haven't been on for that long - I've seen the BTC be as high as 115, and now it's steadily decreasing. I may have the numbers wrong.
I do agree that there'll be volatility in BTC, but think of the enormous incentive that there is to go against this trend. If you buy when BTC is going down and sell when it goes up, then you'll earn money.
Also, i just looked at preev.com, it looks like BTC is back up at 97 usd. Not sure what that's about? People buying because of how low it was, or maybe just a random spike?
@_date: 2013-07-29 15:51:51
It's still silly to carry around and put on public display. It's an easy way to get robbed, and that, regardless of how much the money is worth to you, is not worth it.

Yes, this was my exact first thought as well.
My thoughts instantly flew to a story of a pedophile who had posted his picture on a forum (or something) but applied the twister effect to it so that you couldn't recognize him.
Sadly it was just a matter of applying the twister effect again, in the opposite direction to reconstruct the original image..
He was caught shortly after.

Or bad at hardware and optimization. My impression so far is that this is the case with most of the bitcoin community. Can't speak for how it used to be though, as I am myself just another newb :)
@_date: 2013-08-21 10:16:26
true enough that all bitcoins wont be mined until in a very very long time, but the inflation will be under 2% soon enough.


I disagree with this. Economics are economics. Bitcoin is 'just' the vessel for storage and  transfers.
@_date: 2013-09-21 20:08:37
This is not what my argument is about.

I cannot speak on the behalf of the US, but your argument seems very convincing.  
However, I am in Denmark. The law has yet to go too far here.
Furthermore, I'm not fully understanding this, so please explain it to me:
* There is a law against drugs
* The law against drugs causes a lot of misfortune
* Thus we should continue to go around the law?
Is this not creating more trouble? Is the solution not to make drugs legal?  
Taking the power out of the hands of politicians will, as far as I can see, only make them struggle worse. And bitcoin lover or not, I believe that we should all be able to recognize that the current political system in the US still have quite a few years left before it falls.

Serious question: Is it that bad? Will they push the difficulty so far up that by the time new orderers recieve theirs, they'd not get their money back within, say a year?
@_date: 2013-06-28 08:38:04


I love this counter. It's so simple, and when you think about it, so true.


Yes, I agree that this is very possible.. In the US.
I strongly believe that the currency will live on in europe, and it seems like there's too massive adoption (at least in mining) in china for it to be removed there.
It would be a gift to the 3rd world country if they could use it via mobile phones or such, and even if it was outlawed, I believe that people would still attempt to use it there, because it's practical, and it isn't as volatile as their own currency.
@_date: 2013-08-18 10:10:07
Alright, that's a good point.
Isn't the problem then that there is no way to do non-chargeback transactions, rather than chargeback transaction themselves?
@_date: 2013-06-04 11:44:05
The business transaction part was just what I was looking for. To sum up:
Bitcoins are much like investments, the stock market and shares.
If you buy and/or sell stuff for bitcoins, record what the value of the bitcoins were at that point. This is the value tax should be based on.
@_date: 2013-07-09 11:35:06
You are totally right, many people are in bitcoin for the profit, but I don't think it's *only* a bad thing - I mean, bitcoin is about money after all. I myself came to bitcoin wondering if I could earn a quick buck mining. But then I saw the beauty that is bitcoin - I saw what it could do for the world, and which annoying seemingly unsolvable problems that it could solve.   
Crypto currency is just as big a thing for finances as the higgs particle is for science.
@_date: 2013-08-21 15:27:18
Between the time where you will usually be able to pay for stuff with bitcoin, and the time i would die of old age.
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:57:15
For now, yes. The more business starts within bitcoin, the less it will become a speculative device and the more it will become an actual currency where the digits are attached to real world values.
@_date: 2013-08-21 08:28:08


What is this reason?


I see your point and it's a good one. Is there any proof that this is what will actually happen, and not say economical development slowing down to a halt?


Certainly true. My question thus is if the alternatives are better.
@_date: 2013-08-04 07:43:09
I'm not 100% understanding the first paragraph. Are you suggesting that the malwarebytes or superantispyware sites are not safe?
The 2nd one makes sense. Now that I think of it, I once lost a MSN account when I was looking for a tool to see if others had blocked you (yes, child me was stupid)
@_date: 2013-08-21 08:30:06
My goal is not to gain money, but knowledge, hence i ask.
The wait for an altcoin to prove itself could be quite long, and it certainly wont happen if people, such as myself, don't understand why they are better or worse.
@_date: 2013-07-14 09:09:30
I don't think engineer-send has quite the same ring to it, though it should have
@_date: 2013-08-03 20:57:04
You should probably do a full scan with malwarebytes or superantispyware. I know these names are redicilous, but they're both quite good tools, and free.
I don't know if you CAN get infected without downloading and running an exe, but you sure as hell won't get hurt by doing a scan. Hell, you might even find something that was there previously.

I'm curious what draws you to places like if you don't really like bitcoin, or at least the mentality, all that much?
@_date: 2013-07-18 12:11:19
True enough, but is it relevant? (Don't get me wrong, I love pondering if a tree falling in a Forrest really makes a sound, but it holds little practical value)
If I offer a haircut for half a bitcoin, and this other guy in town sells sandwiches for .2 btc then regardless of the value of bitcoin to others, we will have a fixed price of 2½ sandwich for 1 haircut. This ofcourse is a very easy model to shake, because we are only 2 people. If we were 10 people it would be stronger than that. If we were half of the population, it would be very hard to influence what a service is worth, just like it's difficult to change how many dollar the guy down at the corner store takes for a soda.
@_date: 2013-06-04 10:38:40
I partially don't like this article because it assumes things just as well.
For instance, it assumes that deaths in the coal industry scales with the terawatts being produced. Maybe it has less to do with usage, and more to do with location
It's an interesting thought though, to compare the usage as the article does well.

I'm not really sure what the terms 'unchecked greed' and 'financial woes' mean and I'm having a hard time finding any definitions online - however from what I did find online it seems to relate to Americas economy?
As for the analog:  
Don't worry about the nitpicking, I do enjoy discussing analogies. I actually think that what you describe is exactly what crypto-currency is. It's not anything super great in and off itself, other than being terribly interesting for those involved and full of potential. What I believe we will see is a) bitcoin failing and stronger cryptocurrencies raising or b) systems stacked on top of the bitcoin (or another later cryptocurrencys) platform. In that sense bitcoin is but the part of the leg work that shines and stands out.
That said, I agree that the whole higgs thing has been blown out of proportion. 
@_date: 2013-08-18 07:50:25
To be fair, are there actually anyone claiming that no chargeback is the great part of bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-06-04 11:31:33

Some of us just want to see the overhead that banks and countries pose to money transfers blown to pieces, you know.
I do agree with you that people should be able to do what they want with their bodies, but I don't believe that going around the law is the way.
Yet despite our different take on the politics, we remain bitcoin-brethren.  
So lets speak nicely of each other, ok?

Economics is a science, but just like psychology it is not as pure as math.

That's a theory I'm willing to accept :)
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:58:43
Very true. My point, however, is that it won't continue to drop, and the long term trend shows it going up.
@_date: 2013-06-28 10:46:46
Wont the amount of BTC created be independent from the equipment used to mine? I mean, the more ASIC miners and stuff like that we throw at bitcoin -&gt; the quicker the blocks will be found -&gt; the higher the difficulity the go -&gt; the harder the math puzzles will get -&gt; resulting in an adjustment in the number of blocks found -&gt; meaning the amount of bitcoins generated, thus the price will be largely unaffected.
The article is quite interesting, and it's also very interesting to see that ECB, or at least the people presenting at ECB, aren't actually all that against BTC, just that they don't really understand it.
 
@_date: 2013-07-29 11:12:58
Why on earth did you have 3 BTC on there? Would you go anywhere with 305 USD in cash in your wallet?
@_date: 2013-07-09 11:14:04
You are absolutely right, you could have earned MORE money by simply investing in bitcoins.
However, that does not mean that buying these are a bad investment, simply that it's not the MOST money-yielding one. It is still profitable, presuming bitcoin will continue to raise, and I am willing to bet on that.
What we have to take into account from then is: What is the value of supporting the bitcoin network by having a miner to the individual investors? If the personal-value of supporting the bitcoin network &gt; the profit-value gab between investing in bitcoin and buying the miner, then you will have overall 'profited'. Just like the guy who bought a pizza for a LOT of bitcoin made a bad investment economically in the pizza, he made a good investment in bitcoin by proving that you can in fact buy stuff with bitcoin.
Personally I'm considering to buy a stick-farm like that simply despite there being better mining options, because it *looks* cool (interests even non-tech people) and you can always lend out 1 or 2 to a friend who might then become more interested in bitcoin mining, then in bitcoin itself, thus I will have profited (again: not money) even more because I convinced another person to join us!

Correct me if i'm wrong.

@_date: 2013-09-24 08:19:14
I don't agree. Libertarianism in and of itself is fine - a bit extreme for my taste. As I see it, the problem is, as often, the people. I think that the problem is that people who are bad at logic tend to seek the extremes, and libertarianism is one of those places. I'm sure that libetarianism has its place, but I don't think that it's the place that most people who call themselves libertarians want that place to be.
Essentially, I think calling yourself a libertarian is often a misused way of saying that you're a non-violent anarchist.

@_date: 2013-08-22 18:52:07
That blows pretty hard. Though, to be fair, in a 'real' bitcoin economy, this kind of increase wouldn't happen.
Still, I get the point: There's basically not such thing as a 'safe' loan and the longer you wait, the deeper shit you'll be in.
I can't help but think if bitcoiners problem with inflation is actually a problem with inflation or if it's a problem with the government doing the inflation? The way I see it, there could potentially be a way for the inflated value to be distributed among people. Either through being an active node in the network, or maybe just for being a living person.
@_date: 2013-09-23 12:34:45
The thing is that I've been here before.
There's nothing wrong with libertarianism, but it seems to me that if you get together a bunch of randomly selected libertarians in an internet room, ensure a steady flow of them being switched out with new ones, you'll get one serious debate from which you might learn something, and 99 debates which are essentially attempts at proving you wrong or logic which is filled with flaws - not teaching you you a thing, maybe other than how to debate with lacking logic. My conclusion on that one is that the best argument is no argument.
As for the learning part: I have better ways of learning that shoveling through shit this deep.
