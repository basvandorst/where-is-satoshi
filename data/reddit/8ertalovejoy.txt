The guy? What, Bitcoin's largest betting site is one guy in your alternative reality? Get over yourself, 500 clones and wannabes with half a Bitcoin in bets total aren't competition for anything.

Unlike all the others, owned by nice people that ran off with your coins.

Betfair LOSES about 70 million pounds a year. Stop being a redditard.

Here's a thought: it's been a thing in Bitcoin for longer than you have. And for that matter, for longer than anything else you know.

Yeah because copying the leader in a new color scheme is revolutionary now. Successor has success in it, your thing does not.
Anyway, keep it up, your impotent rage at how your shitsite isn't going anywhere even after all the shit you;ve been eating all over reddit re BitBet is lulzworthy.

So basically you can't actually take any bets. People can put offers and wait for someone to take their bet, which may happen, for instance, never. So if someone puts 1000 BTC on your site at 2.5, you cover 0.01 BTC of it at 2.5 and the rest just waits. If that noob wins, he gets 1000.0025 BTC for his profit, or 0%. So much better than BitBet, Really.
