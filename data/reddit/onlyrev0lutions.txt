They REFUSED to accept my sock filled with quarters.

Actually this is good for bitcoin.

What if your parents start to charge you rent? Or stop buying your groceries for you?

And all you dorks do is hoard and then hope the other cultists don't notice when you dump your junk coins.
Bitcoin is a flawed economy. Dogecoin is sustainable.

    ^This!

You're either too retarded to place a simple online order or lying.

My advice is to bail out immediately and sell your coins before they're even more valueless. Get out while the getting is good and there are still enough people buying it for you to cash out.
Put your money into blue chip stocks and bonds.

In that case it will always be a silly hobbiest investment and never a currency. I'm alright with that but people need to atop saying it's one thing when it's the other.

Complaints are exclusively from retards who have no idea how to put parts together. Newegg is a fantastic company.

The same can be said for Bitcoin.
I think Doge is a better coin as it isn't based on a pyramid scheme that rewards early adoptors above all else.

Post proof LOL. No one is actually managing to liquidate Bitcoin at these rates. It's only useful for ransom payouts and drug purchases. It absolutely cannot be converted back into real money.
Once you buy into the pyramid scheme you stay there.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:22:32
Show me how that pretend card lets you actually convert your ransom coins into real US dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:12:53
Prove it. You can't because you don't have the criminal connections to actually cash out of this Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:16:05
Okay now try to cash some of that out. Oh wait you can't because Bitcoin isn't even real.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:07:26
Ok so sell some. Oh wait your can't because you're not in the Russian mob.
