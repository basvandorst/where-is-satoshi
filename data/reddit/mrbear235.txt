I'd like to know *why* I'm getting that error. DDoS? Server move?
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:36:48
I didn't ask for a *nasty* answer. I asked for an answer.

I didn't know it was a browser issue. I thought it was them suddenly implementing a withdraw limit. That's suspicious. I wanted to know what was going on...
Firefox on Ubuntu^14.10 . How do I fix it? Do you know?
@_date: 2015-02-05 23:40:48
It also happened with the 2 other coins that Block.io supports, BTC and DOGE.
And yes, thank you for pointing out that he/she/it doesn't need to be an a**hole about it.
+20 doge
(I'd tip BTC but I can't withdraw from Block.io^schocker . I have some doge in my Dogetipbot account. I'd tip BTC if I could.)
In addition, is tiny and isn't very helpful. Sorry /r/litecoin.
