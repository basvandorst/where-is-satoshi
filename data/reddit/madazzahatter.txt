Yes, I caught that myself.
Do you think they misunderstood or were just using general terms to make it easier to understand for the masses?

Some points from the story:
*"BTC China Co. said it and four other bitcoin trading platforms agreed to adopt stricter practices such as halting margin trading and short selling. They also agreed to not participate in bitcoin marketing conferences and gatherings, according to a statement posted yesterday on the website of BTC China, the oldest of the nation’s bitcoin operators.*
*BTC China, OKCoin and Huobi.com will no longer attend the Global Bitcoin Summit on May 10 as planned, BTC China Chief Executive Officer Bobby Lee said by phone yesterday. Speakers from the exchanges who were to appear at the conference were taken off an updated schedule sent to media yesterday by organizers."*

Here's a brief summary from the story:
*"Police forces in Tokyo and Fukuoka teamed up for the operation to arrest Ayumu Teramoto, 38, on suspicion of buying a “stimulant drug” from abroad, a spokesman for Tokyo Metropolitan Police said.*
*It was not clear what the drug was, but the phrase is often used to describe substances such as cocaine or methamphetamine.*
*Media, including national broadcaster NHK, said it was the first time someone had been arrested in Japan for a drug transaction that involved bitcoin.*
*Teramoto used bitcoin to buy some 50 grams of the drug, worth 3.5 million yen, NHK said, citing police sources.*
*The package arrived at Narita airport near Tokyo, concealed inside a tablet computer, NHK said.*
*Tokyo police declined to discuss financial and other details of the suspected deal, only confirming that Teramoto used an online service to import the drug via the United States and was arrested on Wednesday."*

I hope so.
Sure, on the surface, just buying a hot dog is no big deal, but to me, the fact that it's *OK* to buy said hot dog using bitcoin is the real story.

Sorry, just coming off the holidays here in Tokyo, so this was the first I'd heard about it.
Nothing turned up when I searched the title before posting it, so I thought that this'd be a safe submission!!
