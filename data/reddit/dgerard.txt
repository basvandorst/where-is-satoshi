Mostly that the promise of privacy of channels goes out the window. Everyone on the network knows who everyone else on the network is dealing with at all times.
Maybe it could be approximated with a public network of just the hubs.
But I'm still interested in official comment from the devs and/or sponsoring organisations on the desired approach, of course.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:13:23
So, a bit like UUCP then? UUCP rapidly became a hub-and-spoke architecture in practice.
It's important to keep in mind: UUCP hand-routing was routinely used by people because it was the only thing available, but it was *an unreliable pain in the backside* - email by Pony Express. People abandoned it as soon as actual DNS came along and SMTP was feasible. And UUCP didn't involve possible charges for messages or message passing.
Are there plans for a DNS-like structure for the LN? If so, how would it work?


It's not at all clear how, though ... we're talking about money, so "perfectly fine" has a higher required standard of service than '80s email.

No, I mean even finding a reliable route. People get concerned when money is involved.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:20:58
I'd definitely be interested in specific detail on that. As I said, as far as I know this would be a new and noteworthy technique in routing.
Looking at Ripple's site, all I see is that RippleNet has [100 members]( not clear if that's nodes or what; the [solutions page]( has no detail on how xVia works.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:10:57
As I understand it, there isn't yet a solution to routing transactions point-to-point through the network - from arbitrary user A to arbitrary user B.
Has this been solved yet?
(In general, is there a solution to this problem, of A-to-B routing through a peer-to-peer gossip network? I don't think there was one even in the days of UUCP email, when this was something people dealt with daily - they worked out bang-paths by hand, or used the monthly network maps and pathalias. And even then it wasn't a very reliable system. If LN can solve this, or even workably approximate a solution when we're dealing with real money, it will be important new work in computer science.)
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:19:14
Per my other comment, the closest analogy I can think of, that was used for a practical network people used a lot, was 1980s email via UUCP, a gossip network that rapidly went hub-and-spoke. (Because gossip networks naturally tend that way because it's more efficient.)
I don't know what economic plan the developers are working to - I don't know of an official one, and I've asked a few times - but if it goes hub-and-spoke and the hubs can charge a fee to act as an intermediary, I'm pretty sure you can get credit out of that - in the sense of the promise of money that can be used like money. At that moment, digital gold hits the late 1600s and we start seeing the equivalent of banknotes being used in place of the actual gold. I could be wrong, but not on the evidence available.

It definitely wins on network effects, it's true. But it's still one of a class of asset. You're still arguing with the actual real-life market - which cares about its own ideology, and not about yours.


While Bitcoin's cryptography is solid, the Bitcoin space has been notorious for scams and scammers since BTC was first tradeable for conventional currency. Hacks and simply losing your keys to errors are commonplace.
The "security" is a six-inch steel blast door ... in a plastic frame. Making it a *twelve*-inch steel blast door may not be the first order of business for day-to-day *functional* security of the *whole system*. The saying is not "a chain is only as strong as its strongest link."


If LN proves to be a good payment network, that ordinary everyday no-coiners want to use ... then there's no reason for it to stay tethered to Bitcoin. It's already been ported to Litecoin, for example; it could use anything as layer one. Perhaps a central bank dollar-substitute token?
Second-layer networks can't really be used as a justification for Bitcoin's usability difficulties, as they aren't at all obliged to stay with Bitcoin if they take off.
You're quite correct that the things you describe are important strengths of Bitcoin. But I'm not convinced they're sufficiently *unique* strengths to make bitcoins a different sort of creature to anything else on the crypto markets.
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:31:40


Then you are (as Ammous is) arguing with how the actual, observed, real life markets work - Bitcoin is the *biggest*, but it's qualitatively just another "crypto," and is in fact pretty interchangeable for the market's purposes - both as a trading commodity, and as currency for the consumer markets that use it.
In the context of the markets, Bitcoin has a hard case pleading functional uniqueness.
The market doesn't care about Bitcoin's ideology, only its own ideology.

author here. To summarise my answer to your question
* the existing finance system has lots wrong with it, holy shit
* bitcoin asked a lot of the right questions
* as a practical system here in 2018 - not talking about future potential, but actaully-existing reality - bitcoin's answers actually do even worse than the existing system
* (and LN is still very very very alpha)
* give me a system that works better from the viewpoint of people who aren't already bitcoiners, and I'll admit "yep, this is a better payment/finance system"
I don't expect anyone here to agree with me of course ;-)

You've given me literally no reason to believe this. The official public page for the Lightning Network is two two-year-old documents and a two-year-old video. I'm starting to think there is not, in fact, anything coherent of what the LN is or how it works in late 2017.

The main problem I can see is that the OSI talks about this in terms of [trademarks the organisation actually owns]( This appears to be an attempt to assert trademark-like rights over what's clearly a generic term.
The only FSF/OSI-approved licence I can think of with a standards-like requirement is the [SISSL]( The trouble is you don't have a standard to point to - Bitcoin works like the Bitcoin code - and so "be backwards consensus compatible" is not in any way a clear requirement.

Given the literal response in this thread from a LN developer was "try harder" without checkable correct sources of information, this seems the opposite of what's already happened.

I am indeed trying, which is why I'm asking! But the white paper - which is still right there on the front page of  - hasn't been updated in near on two years, and the rest of the documentation is ... thinly distributed.
If you don't already have a simple and concise writeup on this level, you seriously need to do one. You know the level of thing I'm talking about, you've written enough of them. Something for people who can understand a bit of tech and/or finance but aren't into cryptocurrency - they're going to be interested in money, so it should be entirely possible to get the idea across without handwaving. Expecting them to play "twenty questions" with you probably isn't a workable process if you'd prefer the resulting writeup to resemble what you envisage.
I'll answer the rest later, but "0.1-1%" is from [here]( - were you misquoted?


Here's a tangential question: is there any analysis of the economics of LN, from anyone involved in the protocol design? How it will work as a financial system. I'm assuming someone's contemplated this in depth.

Sorry about that, yes, [I'm completely wrong there](
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:39:30
First I think you'd need an actual standard to refer to that isn't literally just the code. So that would probably be the first thing to write, unless you have one already.
DFSG [accepts]( CC by-sa 3.0 and later. There appears to be one guy who hates CC &gt;=3.0, but [the actual Debian devs]( use it in practice.
I'm not saying I think there'd be a legal barrier to you doing this, but it comes across as an attempt to take it effectively proprietary. And asserting trademark-like claims (and referring to OSI on use of trademarks a project or company does in fact own in the process) on a clear generic term that's the name of a project that you came to years after it started strikes me as a practice in free software that would be generally not to be encouraged; I can't think of any previous examples of someone trying this.
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:04:17
Because about 100% more LN devs will be here, I'd expect. Though I did ask there too, and on If you *want* to be written about without people even asking, I can do that ... but if this is the technology that will make Bitcoin a scalable payment mechanism, I'd have thought you'd want people to hear about it, and get it right as opposed to wrong.
But the [official publicity material]( is literally years old, and it appears common to complain "you got the LN wrong!" without providing links to what's right. Finding current information on the LN is like tracking a maze of twisty little passages, all different and most of them dead ends.
If you wanted to have an important Bitcoin technology misrepresented, this would be just the strategy to take.
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:30:28


Right. So where's the one that's particularly better than mine, and would be comprehensible to a non-bitcoiner? I'm trying to write this because I couldn't find one, instead finding various things that aren't or are deep jargon arguments or are two years old. I would be *delighted* not to have to bother.


["christian decker" "lightning network" "economics"]( doesn't show anything obvious. What were you thinking of?
I ask because I'm pretty sure you get credit - manufacturing something usable for the purposes of money, effectively fractional reserve - out of the system from collateralising the transmission fees. These are assets that can be speculated on. These credit transactions would necessarily become commoditized as a result of hub centralization, such that the biggest hubs would be the most reliable (read, "least risky"); this isn't to say that smaller hubs wouldn't exist but their transactions would be limited and fewer lenders would be willing to lend because of risk. Because of that, bigger hubs can essentially hedge the risk of smaller hubs and to rationalize the process, package them together in a portfolio. Boom - you've got yourself a derivatives market. If people don't fully understand that a digital gold standard wouldn't solve 2008, they'll proceed to accidentally recreate it.
Of course, I am hopefully dead wrong there. (And that's pretty worst case.) Which is why I'm asking if this has been considered, and if so a cite to where. I appreciate you have plenty of other things to do, and will be grateful for any assistance. But seriously, at the moment someone fresh trying to find out about LN is faced with a maze of twisty passages, mostly dead ends.

@_date: 2011-06-19 15:06:39
Bitcoin is a decentralised computer currency designed by self-righteous Ayn Rand-reading nerds who despise looters and parasites like, er, you. It is used to purchase Internet services, illegal drugs and pictures of naked women holding video cards.
Bitcoin works by an emergent synergy of cryptography, peer-to-peer, anonymity, anarchism, libertarianism, wasting stupendous quantities of electricity, the marketing department at NVidia, the enduring exchange value of tulip bulbs and doing all of this instead of Folding
Bitcoin successfully harnesses a hitherto-unexploited Internet resource: the vast reserves of unexamined privilege amongst computer programmers. Coins are “mined” by stealing them from people who are able to comprehend this level of computer science but still keep their Bitcoin wallet in plain text on a Windows machine.
The Bitcoin system is robustly designed to continue past the collapse of the US dollar and the world economy, as the Internet, fast computers and reliable electricity are all expected to be readily available when barbarian hordes are wandering the burnt-out post-apocalyptic remnants of civilisation.
It is completely incorrect to describe Bitcoin as a “pyramid scheme.” Technically, it’s a “pump-and-dump.”
Many common products are still inexplicably not purchasable with Bitcoins. “It’s as if they don’t understand the revolutionary wonder of Bitcoin,” says Debian developer Hiram Nerdboy, 17. “I can’t get chicks with Bitcoins either. Even with my slickest Pick-Up Artist techniques! It’s as if my knowledge of economics and game theory didn’t apply to real life. But that’s impossible, of course. They’re probably just theists. Hold on, I just gotta post to Slashdot about this.”
Bitcoin was invented by Internet libertarians, in the spirit of freely-chosen individual interpersonal interactions that will bring about the utter collapse of the oppressive taint of the dead hand of government, in order to make money at your expense.
