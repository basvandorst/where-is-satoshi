I would be the happiest teen alive if I only had one bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-05-01 02:24:35
I got It! Thanks for giving me my first dogecoins stranger! and sorry if my english is bad, it is my second language. :)
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:19:06
We use the dollar as a national currency. We don't have a central bank here. A two way atm would be awesome. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 10:04:16
What if theres no electricity? 
@_date: 2014-05-01 14:59:41
I just want to point out that if you go to blockchain.info and click in some of the addresses that are making transactions right now, it shows that its being made somewhere off the coast of west africa in the atlantic ocean. I think atlantis just started to accept bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-05-25 06:28:27
Bitcoin is a win win situation, if the price goes up yo make money, if the price goes down you can buy more! WIN-WIN!
@_date: 2014-05-30 23:14:46
Thanks! I don't know you but you truly are awesome! :') 
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:24:27
Right now I see bitcoin as gold 2.0 and litecoin could very well be silver 2.0
@_date: 2014-06-24 22:54:19
Bitcoin is love; bitcoin is life. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 15:51:40
It would be amazing to see a world ruled by algorithms! 
The laws of mathematics FTW!
@_date: 2014-05-08 03:24:35
It feels really good!
@_date: 2014-07-03 22:08:00
They are making it too easy for us... Its like if they wanted bitcoin to succed.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:32:30
You are right! It's time to get more bitcoins!
@_date: 2014-07-09 04:47:05
Will mycelium allow to customize the miner fee? Please??
@_date: 2014-07-11 03:39:55
Well for me it is.
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:19:13
I already have my space helmet on!
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:01:49
this must be one of the most epic gifs I have ever seen.
@_date: 2014-05-17 01:05:59
Personally, I love bitcoin and dogecoin too, specially for all the love that the community gives!
@_date: 2014-06-02 03:11:37
Win win situation.
@_date: 2014-07-04 15:35:15
Is there a to the mars guy? If not we need one.
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:42:29
Thats my favorite too!
@_date: 2014-05-14 02:29:00
Just spread the love! 20 bits

This could be an awesome Bitcoinisland!
@_date: 2014-06-14 12:45:53
I love how the EMP is more likely than any of the other options...
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:13:32
If they could open one in Panama too it would be great! We don't have a central bank so its even better! 
@_date: 2014-05-13 19:49:31
Yep I lost dogecoins too. Lesson learned.
@_date: 2014-06-18 01:16:38
I would be very grateful if someone puts one of this in Panama. It would be very useful for me.
@_date: 2014-06-10 02:15:21
Your welcome. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:25:52

1.6k upvotes in just 7h. Wow!
@_date: 2014-05-21 01:39:33
This sucks! Im not going to be able to buy until sunday and seeing the price rise is killing me! I need bitcoins!
@_date: 2014-05-16 21:07:50
You could have a small fortune in a couple of years if bitcoin goes to the MOON.
@_date: 2014-05-10 13:20:21
The moon is not enough we need to go further!
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:25:04
I would have taken those 0.01 btc without thinking!
@_date: 2014-05-31 03:17:35
Alternative ending! After all that happens and he throws it into the ocean we realize that he is not really satoshi but a guy hired by him and years later when bitcoin have got to the moon we get to see the back of a man standing looking at the sunset and we see in his phone how he gets all the bitcoins back. It would be so badass!
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:55:08
Me too, thats my goal but I have to say I have less than 0.7 
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:39:05
We haven't even started the launch process but the countdown will start soon!
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:15:48
If I had a business in central america and I would like to start accepting bitcoin as payment what exactly would I have to do?
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:22:55
I. am. so. close!
@_date: 2014-05-14 02:41:13
This is actually a VERY good idea!
@_date: 2014-05-16 20:35:30
Really people??? "Troll79!" TROLL.
@_date: 2014-06-29 17:28:32
I live in panama, and my only way to buy is from someone else. People make small satoshis squares every 2-3 weeks.
@_date: 2014-05-18 02:19:41
Im sorry for my ignorance but what does "built on top of bitcoin" actually means?
@_date: 2014-05-13 19:31:44
Thats my goal. My dream is to have 1 whole bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-15 01:54:06
Welcome! To the financial renaissance. Someday I hope to say, that I was there when it all begun. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:44:50
Yeah Im kinda new to reddit.
@_date: 2014-05-24 01:49:28
I believe bitcoin will reach the MOON at the end of the year, but its just a guess...
@_date: 2014-05-16 02:35:54
Im not american but still... Fuck The FCC!
@_date: 2014-06-02 00:39:50
Decentralized ALL the things!!!
@_date: 2014-07-06 18:16:05
 this is a really good site to learn.
@_date: 2014-07-07 19:26:57
Decentralize all the things!
@_date: 2014-06-14 16:10:02
P2Pool FTW!
@_date: 2014-07-03 18:59:09
I love mycelium but I would be really happy if their android wallet had an option to customize the miner fee, it is really a pain for small transactions and tips.
@_date: 2014-05-29 18:35:08
What is an orphan block?
@_date: 2014-05-19 00:46:52
bitcoin is being like "yeah, Im just going to chill while everyone is excited for all the good news..." and when everyone starts saying: "oh yeah bitcoin is stable now!" Its suddenly going to explode!
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:21:24
Spread the love!
@_date: 2014-05-31 00:14:24

How can you get dogecoins???
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:49:09
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:54:50
Hahahaha Thank you very much!
@_date: 2014-07-11 00:07:57
With one bitcoin I would be the happiest man alive.
@_date: 2014-05-20 00:07:32
Right now I feel a lot better keeping my money in bitcoin than in fiat...
@_date: 2014-07-01 12:29:40
So is this going to be make fun of bitcorn day now on?
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:57:53
@_date: 2014-05-08 23:08:14
@_date: 2014-05-31 00:15:13
Which one would you say is the safest and least complicated option?
@_date: 2014-05-01 01:43:40
Im new to reddit and I have no idea how to get the doge you send me. :(
@_date: 2014-07-06 01:48:37
Beer always tastes better if you buy it with bitcoin ;) 
@_date: 2014-06-01 17:52:51
Right now Im in a position where I feel more safe having my money in BTC than fiat. We are in the beginning of a financial renaissance! To the Moon!
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:42:17
To the Moon.
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:10:20
 
@_date: 2014-05-16 19:33:52

@_date: 2014-06-01 17:00:17
What its going on?!
@_date: 2014-05-20 04:34:04

@_date: 2014-05-17 01:40:43
Just spread the love!
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:41:54
Jehovah's witness style!
@_date: 2014-05-13 23:28:59
Well I live in a country called panama in central america so its not so easy to get bitcoins here and Im 17 and the law doesn't let you work unless you are 18 or older so I don't have a lot of money so yeah...
@_date: 2014-06-04 00:42:17
I love to see the price rising but a part of me still feels like I haven't bought enough bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-05-01 02:12:35
thanks :)
@_date: 2014-05-08 02:48:02
What about Pheeva?
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:27:06
Thats a nice group of friends you got there!
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:23:28
Part 2  LOL!
And here we go again!
@_date: 2014-06-26 03:01:46
Give me your bitcoins and these are not the droids you are looking for...
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:15:51
1 Moon!
@_date: 2014-05-24 00:00:20
Im from Panama in central america and almost no one knows what bitcoin is in here, I have met only a handful of people who know what it is and I believe there is only like 3 businesses in the entire country that accept bitcoins. We don't have a central bank and bitcoin could be huge in here if people had access more easily to bitcoin and knew what it was. There is a market waiting to flourish here. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 02:03:13
It is good news because people are realizing how screwed up the financial system is right now and how there could be a way to be free from any entity over your money. Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:39:11
The power of innovation.
@_date: 2014-05-18 02:27:20
We don't need regulations,
the market regulates itself.
 Bitcoin can not be control.
 Innovation, makes regulations unnecessary. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 20:20:14
I would love to get spammed with those all day!
@_date: 2014-05-16 00:13:57
I really want 10$ of bitcoin but sadly im not in the us and im not a college student yet...
@_date: 2014-06-07 02:23:29
This is by far my favorite mobile wallet out there.
@_date: 2014-05-21 23:39:56
Im still waiting for Bitcity, the city of the future!
@_date: 2014-05-13 20:53:33
I will!
@_date: 2014-05-31 03:02:39
Maybe because they know the dollar is dying and they prefer bitcoin than another superpower(China, Russia) to have control over the world financial system.
@_date: 2014-05-25 06:34:00
Don't jinx it!
@_date: 2014-05-30 23:54:50

Mycelium is by far my favorite bitcoin wallet out there!
@_date: 2014-05-18 03:18:41
It is not sarcasm, I was talking about myself. :)
@_date: 2014-05-18 23:10:26

@_date: 2014-07-08 00:51:05
So is this good or bad fr bitcoin?!?!
@_date: 2014-06-06 16:38:32
I dont have any btc rigth now but have an upvote.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:28:50
Bitcoin is love; bitcoin is life.
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:13:32
My theory is that with all those new companies accepting bitcoin, the price is dropping because they exchange it to dollars, but its still good news because it means bitcoin is starting to become mainstream. So don't panic and HODL! 
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:18:10
Panama :)
@_date: 2014-06-11 19:50:30
The fire is spreading fast for visa and MasterCard and I cant wait for the day that the only thing that remains of them are memories.

Well guys... *puts on space helmet* Ill see you on the moon!
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:35:57
I just hope that the bars in heaven accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:55:47
I don`t like this "dollars", they are just a bunch of pieces of paper with no value and it sounds like a ponzi S.
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:33:10
You are awesome! I was looking forward to this!
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:01:11
I want bits too :(
@_date: 2014-05-25 06:31:14
Im in love with bitcoin! I would marry that currency if I could!
@_date: 2014-05-30 02:30:50
Which wallet are you using?
@_date: 2014-06-17 22:02:36
Why is this being downvoted, it looks like a really cool site or am I wrong?
@_date: 2014-05-30 10:03:32
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:12:10
Im not going to be able to buy until sunday! 
Seeing the price go up is killing me... :( 
@_date: 2014-05-17 22:45:49
The power of innovation :)
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:43:09
 right now p2pool is at 1% 
@_date: 2014-05-16 02:27:07
Well that is actually really clever. And I think you sended the bits to yourself. (: ( sorry if my english is bad, its my second language)
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:26:27
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:47:54
Im in the exact same situation, but my problem is that my only way to buy bitcoins is from someone else and Its pretty difficult to find someone that knows what bitcoin is where I live. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 02:10:37
wait send it to this one instead DSyFj9mLHaMnhBwZeTHucBNgnNZubzbXKw
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:54:20
Deep inside, An evil side of my wants the dollar to crash so people realize how bad it is...
@_date: 2014-05-16 10:50:32
Got it!  Thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-08 03:58:25
Well that is a cool word to tip!
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:41:29
I would spend all in bitcoins and move to bali.
@_date: 2014-07-10 23:44:08
I would be happy if I only had one...

Someday those satoshis are going to be worth a nice amount.
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:46:19
Hey guys what if we customized the upvote so when you press it a bitcoin sign appears.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:09:02

Here you go 
@_date: 2014-05-18 02:46:15
I know how you feel... When you live in a third world country where only a handful of people know what bitcoin is, it is not so easy to get them.
But still Im in love with bitcoin! 
People don't realize how BIG this is for the world. Bitcoin is making people grow independent, it is giving them freedom from the banks and even from governments. 
The creation of bitcoin for me is the next level; it is the beginning of something huge.
@_date: 2014-06-25 21:03:10
what is and how do you buy reddit gold? and what can you do with it?
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:52:50
I dont care what it is if its money Ill take it specially bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-05-13 23:29:47
Thanks! Kind shibe!
@_date: 2014-06-21 19:15:27
No, and I think it was pretty stupid to post this without trying first. This might be a scam and I fucked up or it could be a cool site. I will find out after the germany vs ghana match...
@_date: 2014-06-15 02:16:51
@_date: 2014-05-19 20:10:53
Im in love with bitcoin!  Most people dont understand how big this is. bitcoin is the next level. 
This is the beggining of something HUGE!

The news of Ebay considering bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-07-05 18:43:15
Bits are going to be worth a lot in the future we will look back and remember how we use to tip so much money to people as we do now.
@_date: 2014-07-06 20:22:41
I agree with you but I dont like the way you say it. It should be more like "It would be really nice if services like spotify accepted bitcoin. It would make it a lot easier for me" instead of "You better take bit"coin or FUCK YOU."
@_date: 2014-05-18 03:32:52
Hahaha don't worry, its all good. 
I live in Panama in central america.
@_date: 2014-06-10 03:38:24
Well I haven't, but I'm looking forward to the day I do!
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:20:14
Im currently halfway there, but my goal is to get a whole bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:24:30
I do this everyday at school, me and my friends use bitcoin for betting on stuff and buying things for and from each other.
@_date: 2014-06-21 19:16:06
My advice ignore this post until further notice.
@_date: 2014-06-18 20:18:37

@_date: 2014-06-18 01:10:36
Thank you! In the last year I have managed to buy some from a guy that I met once from the US. Im hoping that someday someone puts a bitcoin atm here so it is easier to buy...
@_date: 2014-06-02 03:14:13
Where do you get bitcards?
@_date: 2014-05-19 00:43:41
oh well, at least I got more time to buy more bitcoins while they are cheap.
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:03:48
Yeah if they could bring some to central america, that would be great...
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:50:36
