Amway is a scam though so what's your point?

Just so you know, downvoting all your posts just because you revealed yourself as an asshole with that post. Three pages of dumb posts, took like a minute.

He has to find a way to cash it into real money first though...

Would love to actually see some numbers on that but I doubt you'll produce any.

Given the kind of shit Bitcoiners do regularly....
Anyway, when you have a community that's full of people who think they're more intelligent than they are, and are convinced that they're going to topple governments and issue in a new global AnCap society, it's not much of a stretch to think one of them will be stupid and narcissistic enough to think he should document everything for posterity.
He just didn't consider his readers would be the FBI right now instead of little libertarian children 50 years from now.

An idiot who thinks he won't get caught.
Reminder that there was a redditor who killed his kid and left the evidence of googling how to do it in his browser history. All sorts of people think they're smarter than they really are.

Neither Ulbricht or the defense team has brought up this line of attack.

 best link I can find for it atm, basically just look up the guy and its basically similar to that line from The Simpsons, "videotaping this crime spree is the best idea we ever had!"
Google searched how long it would take a kid to die in a hot car a bunch, took out life insurance on the kid, and the first thing his wife said to him after his arrest was "how much have you told them?" or something along those lines.
Basically like I said, idiots thinking they're smarter than they are and not considering all the ways their plan can fail.
