Thats a joke...I hope someone finds this persons home address and posts it so people can go over and polity ask for their money back.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:23:05

Mine still stuck... any luck your side?
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:54:14
So everyone who uses Changelly has a 50/50 chance of never seeing their money again?
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:24:48
Where is a strong resistance level right now? Everything looks bullish,,,but even more so like a bull trap.

I used to think a day was a long time in crypto....ffs now 2 mins is an eternity. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:42:59
Do you think BTC will ever drop below 8800k again?
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:52:08
Sell everything. Buy back moar at 6k
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:22:44
If it does, it will continue down to around 7??? I think....but so what, it will just go back up.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:33:24
Really struggling to drop below 6600...must be all the buy orders getting triggered. I cannot even fathom what will happen if it drops 1$ below 6k

Guys who have been around the block...without been bias to BTC... Does this look like a bull trap. Were all those loooong green candlesticks just the tether printing or whales buying loads to get everyone else on board before dumping...?
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:34:52
Even this guy doesn't know what to do...or does he?
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:16:44
This would be heaven for whales....a never ending supply of money. Dam I wish I was a whale lol
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:02:02
I try not to be bias with anything, I honestly think this is a terrible time to buy....we know that the big boys want to make money, big greedy never ending money... A dump begins now and a bounce around 7200k res.(Watching btc charts and reading new news every few hours since 2016)
 
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:19:53
Yup, this has been happening a lot...
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:18:33
BTC gettin the toilet paper ready again.
@_date: 2018-04-13 08:23:08
Looking at Cryptowatch..there are always long reds following long greens, someone just made some big money while everyone was jumping on his self created green...the dump is incoming.
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:11:51
Because it will keep going up and up and up and everyone will become lambo rich. Like December. Very smart buying on long greens.
