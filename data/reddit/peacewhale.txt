When we start our approach to the moon, we will reach critical velocity fairly quickly. This element is critical.

How do you get this data? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:51:59
Billion ?
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:48:18
Great so in the best possible case scenario I'll have a couple million bucks. Better to spend the time we spend obsessing over price moves and invest that time into building a business.

Wow cool. What about the cost of hardware? Can we see a photo of thr setup? 
@_date: 2015-07-12 00:02:49
Soon? 
@_date: 2015-07-09 22:33:16
I wonder what the annual odds are. Likely better than the lottery, maybe.

It's not profitable unless you have free electricity

Even if bitcoin market cap rocketed to 100 trillion dollars, 21 bitcoin would only get you a million dollars. Not really life changing 
@_date: 2015-07-12 13:14:46
Based on mathematics. Checks out.
@_date: 2015-07-09 21:51:20
Solo meaning you are awarded coins approximately never? 
@_date: 2015-07-12 00:53:03
Current market cap is $ 3 B, so $3 T would be 1000x, and 1% of that would be 10x, or $3000 per coin. Even in this scenario, your ten coins aren't going to change your life

anyone have the original pdf?
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:26:01
sooo....no go on the lemonade stand
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:08:42
are you aware that if someone at or other places gets the right pass-phrase they are just going to take your BTC rather than handing you the wallet and getting a $20 reward. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:24:45
Or are you saying they should accept bitcoin while they are rowing? 
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:55:35
Does someone have access to the original report?
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:50:46
Revenge is what amplifies evil in the world, if you can transform those negative energies to positive, you are doing what the universe set out to do.

send a dollar to a new address, tell us right before you do it. mighty blockchain verifies all. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:02:24
can someone please make @_date: 2013-11-04 01:19:04
also your salt can be something in public...like the numbers etched into a monument or something...no will crack the fact that THAT string goes before the last word of your silly passphrase

"Can you day trade bitcoin?" 
-"I wouldn't know"
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:30:47
a poor person should not be investing in any type of "coin". he should focus on building marketable skills and accumulating wealth by creating wealth- that is, add something to society and society will pay you for it. So long as you have consciousness, you are already way ahead of 99.9^100% of the universe
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:17:39
need new hint
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:40:49
What if someone or someones gain control of more than half of the miners
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:58:01
Certainly you have meticulous financial models of your own...

You should start this service in protest. Make it a big thing.

If Apple traded at $500 on the nasdaq and $430 on the nyse, would that trouble you at all? 
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:50:43
seems legit ಠ_ಠ
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:29:24
Strange to me that there are people who believe in the "finders keepers" mentality of hacking wallets. If you spend time trying to find brainwallets, you are a thief, just like a bank robber or home burglar is a thief. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:20:48
almost infinitely safe IMHO. The capital R alone explodes the entropy. Even if a dictionary attack ran that sequence of words...it can't run that sequence of words and try capitalizing each permutation of lowercase uppercase
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:23:34
You really shouldn't be bothering people during crew practice. When I'm in a row,  I don't want people coming at me with bitcoin ideas. Next time wait until the row is over, then approach them.
