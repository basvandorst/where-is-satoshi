A lot of companies stole the mouse. Apple actually tried to sue Microsoft for stealing the GUI from them, but the judge threw the case out pointing out that they'd originally stolen it from Xerox.

No, bitcoins don't work that way. What is entirely possible (but seems unlikely if this is an accurate description of Satoshi) is that the private key allowing access to spend those coins has been lost or destroyed since the coins were mined.

The way bitcoins actually work is that there is a giant ledger that has a record of every coin and transaction, and everyone who uses bitcoin has a copy of this ledger (the explanation for how they keep this ledger secure and how it's distributed is really interesting, but it's somewhat technical and very long so for now you'll just need to take my word that it works). All of the bitcoins accounted for in the ledger (which is all of them period) are assigned to  specific addresses. When you own bitcoins, what you keep on your hard drive is not actually any kind of representation of those coins, but a key that proves that you are the owner of that address. We can see in the ledger that there are ~750,000 bitcoins assigned to the address of the very first person to mine bitcoins, and it's extremely unlikely that this person isn't Satoshi. There are other more nuanced tricks that have been used to find more addresses which probably belong to him as well.

Meh, there's probably some old experimental aircrafts and parts from the 70's kicking around there.

When done correctly regulations apply to bad *behavior*. There's not a "good"/"bad" dichotomy where a person can only be one or another, and "good" people aren't and shouldn't be arbitrarily exempt from consequence if they do bad things.

You realize that by ascribing this judgement to people you classify as "conservative" or "liberal" you'd be identifying yourself as a conservative in this schema, correct? I'm not sure if you intended that, as it seems you're also being critical of conservatives.

The courts will only act if the defendant in such a case were running afoul of some law or regulation. Courts don't uphold ethics, they uphold the law. Unregulated means there are no laws regulating people's behavior. The courts will do absolutely nothing for you if you tried to bring a case against someone for insider bitcoin trading to them.

I'll pay my next mortgage payment in commodities and see how it goes.
Edit: To expand a bit on that, when I take out a loan in dollars then that's what I'm obliged to repay it in; not euros or cattle or gold. Even after accounting for the expansion of the monetary supply by fractional reserve banking if you compare the total number of dollars to the total liability/obligations in dollars you'll find the second number is larger. This is by definition because the only time new dollars are introduced into the system a greater amount of liability in dollars is also introduced. It's not a problem for many reasons, not the least of which being that assets can be seized if you fail to meet your obligations, but it's certainly still true.

I'm not wrong, I just didn't feel like getting sidetracked addressing your failure to recognize the implicit ownership that comes with loans. 
Speaking of failure to recognize things that are the same

That last example is useless because the deal would never be to pay purely in cash, it would be to pay in cash plus other assets. If the deal were written such that cash and only cash were required and more than the system held then it *wouldn't* work, which is why they don't do it that way.

"Investing" is another word for "loaning". All you've done is moved the issue along one, not addressed it. If the only institution which can print new money is the fed, and the fed always loans it out with an interest rate, then the amount that needs to be paid back to the fed is more than the amount that the fed actually created. This system only works with fractional reserve banking expanding the monetary supply through additional loans, but if everyone suddenly had to pay back their loans all at once you'd find that by definition there wouldn't be enough (unless there's sufficient counterfeit currency).

Well when you put it that way then obviously I trust that this random rude stranger on the internet has more education on this topic than I do. Did I forget to mention I'm a rocket scientist who also performs brain surgery?
If there are $100 in the system *total* and I owe $120 after I pay back the $100 I have then what? The institution I paid it back to (a stand in for the fed in this hypothetical) could loan it back out to someone else who then pays me but all that does is move the issue.

It seems pretty obvious that it won't to me. FDIC insurance, regulations, and financial maneuvers like quantitative easing means bank runs are virtually unheard of, if anything happened (e.g. asteroid hitting the earth, superflu, other very unlikely things) that managed to constrict credit to the point where this became noticeable we'd have much bigger problems.

That distinction is irrelevant to the issue I describe.

It's backed by the promise of the Bitcoin bankers/bookkeepers/"miners" that they will accept bitcoins as compensation for providing you with a service (namely, processing instant, digital, anonymous, decentralized transactions) the same way USD are backed by the promise of the US government that they will accept USD as compensation for providing you with a service (namely, governance).
