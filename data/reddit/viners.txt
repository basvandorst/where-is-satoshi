Bitcoin already has multisig technology. Just no one is using it correctly. Your password is supposed to act as a key for signing transactions. And you should also be given a third backup key so you can move your funds without the exchange. 2 of 3 is better than 2 of 2. I don't see how lightning will improve this.

Burst activity is going to become much more rare in the future of Bitcoin as the number of daily transactions stabilizes. You can see that happening in the graph you linked. This solution is for the future. 
When there's some rare volatility, there would be congestion, but the network should catch up pretty quickly. I think it's worth it. Gavin is on the right track with this.

What about a mechanism inside the device that detaches a cryptocurrency drive whenever the wallet is not in use. Then when you go to pay, you can hit a button that attaches it inside the device. It would be physically impossible to steal the coins, yet just as convenient as online wallets. Kind of like a Trezor but all in one device that let's all the other functions stay online except the private key.
Obviously it would be hard to have a big name manufacturer implement wallet technology in a device.

So they can't steal it, but couldn't they hold it hostage?

I actually feel a lot safer avoiding banks. I guess it could be useful for people who aren't very secure?

The biggest concern here is definitely centralization. All the chips will be hard coded to mine for 21, so they could potentially control the blockchain.

@_date: 2017-02-23 19:37:13
How would you force the other miners to lower their excessive block size in their settings? You would need 51% of all miners to do this in order for a *ridiculously small block attack* to not be orphaned. This is just as impractical as any other 51% attack.
Let's say the miners wanted to coordinate such an attack on a multi-billion dollar currency, costing them everything they have invested into bitcoin. Do you really think a GUI is the only thing stopping them? They could just tell each other to change their Core client to accept smaller block sizes.

@_date: 2017-03-22 15:24:58
Right, I think if we activated segwit right now that we would be fine without a block size increase. But it's not activating because the other side is pushing for bigger blocks immediately.
So if we will almost certainly need bigger blocks in the future, is it more responsible to fight with a reckless solution that might win (and even if they don't, cause serious damage), or to give a safe solution, with no downsides, that would settle everything? To me, a serious divide is a bigger threat than 2MB blocks with 17%+ per year. Not to mention that after this, bitcoin has no more serious technical roadblocks and it can become truly immutable. Trying to gain consensus for a hard fork in the future will be much harder than now.

The price went down when Hearn left. Classic support came after that and then the price went up. Check the times.
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:59:43
Do you honestly think the BU devs have bad intentions or that their opinion is just different than yours? When max efficiency is achieved through the segwit, LN, schnorr sigs, and whatever comes next, the only scaling solution left will be through the block size.

I don't think you need bitcoin to buy bitcoin lol. Do you?
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:45:03
Yeah by 2140. Hopefully the fees aren't bigger than the block reward too soon.
@_date: 2016-01-17 13:46:14
Classic hasn't even been released yet and already has the majority of the community supporting it. How exactly has it "had it's chance"?
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:32:42


Yes, and the exact same thing happens if the fork happens too. BCC == BTC, according to Bitfinex.


I would not reference this as the market deciding until after a fork happens, like I said. And I probably wouldn't guarantee which side gets the BTC ticker, it's way too soon.

I wouldn't call that accurate until we are sure a fork will happen. Right now those tokens are worthless.
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:38:34


Really? I've gotten much different vibes considering that they could have avoided XT, Classic and BU if they added a permanent blocksize scaling solution to their roadmap. If something like this was coded and ready (to activate after segwit activates), we could activate segwit no problem. I guarantee it.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:41:43
So the results displayed now are from the tesnet? Maybe you should put a disclaimer about that.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:43:28
So you want Bitcoin to lose even more market share to alt coins? That has the exact same effect as a fork.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:04:06
Giving in would be running BU, which is not what I'm advocating. I'm talking about what bitcoin needs regardless of what the miners want. I don't want the devs to make decisions just to spite the miners. The blocksize debate didn't start with miner threats, it started from the users and devs.
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:01:29
Actually you can say approval. The decision would have to be made before the 2 weeks. After that, if they don't decide, it's approved.
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:39:00
Projectionism. This community is advocating a "user activated soft-fork" backed by nodes. Failed to get mining support, so they must resort to a sybil attack.
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:36:33
We should delete all bitcoin subreddits too.
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:35:45
His pool isn't even signaling support for BU. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-03-15 01:51:26


Who can't afford to process 2MB blocks now, and 4MB blocks a few years after that? It can scale in a completely safe way, with growing limits built into the protocol, unlike BU. I said nothing about a "flex", although Monero and Ethereum seem to be doing just fine with similar solutions.


No, but the base layer needs enough capacity to support the input/output of the second layers. Right now it does not.
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:26:47
Please don't tell me what I've heard if you don't know what I'm referring to. I suggested an uncontentious hard fork with a safe limit increase, referencing BIP 103, and they said "no, the block size limit should never be increased". This was not on reddit.
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:19:38
Okay then. I must have missed that commit in the repo.
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:08:26
So you're saying people should leave their BTC on the lightning network indefinitely and there is no downside?
If I understand correctly, the on and off ramp would always require a P2SH transaction on the blockchain, and if this is used globally, the blockchain fees would be very high, meaning it would only be practical to get on with large amounts. Then if someone tries scamming you, it's either pay another large fee or be scammed.
Could LN channel payments be integrated into hardware wallets or no? If not, wouldn't that create a hacking vulnerability?

If IME has code specifically for Linux, then it is an attack on Linux.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:18:37
And if it doesn't happen, BCU tokens will be destroyed. However in both cases BCC tokens are converted into BTC. So this is not an accurate depiction of BTU at all. It would be after the fork happens.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:39:16
Indeed. A *conservative* block size growth will help the LN too. It's a win-win for everyone. Instead of forking a PoW change just out of spite, why not fork to a safe block size increase? I really don't get all this hostility towards a hard fork (to avoid risking a split) and then when BU comes along everyone is chanting "LETS FORK POW", completely contradicting their earlier statements.
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:05:53
The lightning network will work horribly with 1MB blocks, even with segwit. A much more conservative version of BIP 101 would be ideal for the LN to function properly.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:42:28
Linux is open source, but pretty much all CPUs today are closed source with the ability to spy on users.
@_date: 2017-03-19 11:18:17
Just read the post on bitfinex, it's not that long. Says BCU will become BTU if a fork happens, and BCC will become BTC in both cases.
@_date: 2017-03-21 08:21:39
What are you getting at? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:31:09
So basically this includes all SPV nodes from wallet apps? How are those classified as Core nodes?
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:06:40


Ideally, how big do you want bitcoin to get? If 7 billion people wanted to use bitcoin with the LN, they could only settle 2 transactions per year to the blockchain with 133MB blocks. We know bitcoin has no problem growing in popularity, it's just a matter of time until we *need* bigger blocks. Segwit can alleviate the tension in the meantime.
There are ways to increase the block size limit that aren't reckless like BU though. Look at BIP 103 which was written by the core dev sipa. A conservative and predictable block size growth will help the decentralization of the LN and bitcoin tremendously.
@_date: 2017-03-15 01:26:15
I do, still want a plan for bigger blocks though.
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:55:27


It's not about "culture". It's just about the block size, sheesh. We've been begging Core to increase it for 1-2 years. They are welcome to join in on the fork. If they were responsible, they would have planned ahead a *long* time ago.
@_date: 2017-03-10 01:02:20
"ever". Even if the ETF is denied, do you really think that?
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:47:42

No, but the base layer needs enough capacity to support the input/output of the second layers. Right now it does not.

Why do you assume it would be equal?

The filing says it will be the coin with the most mining power.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:41:12
It's not really a bet because they've said that BCC will be BTC no matter what. It seems like it's more of a preparation for a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-25 08:33:24
So besides the name you have no explanation? Without mining support, it is a hard fork.

@_date: 2017-03-24 18:34:41
I don't think a compromise would be "messy"? BU allows for any block size so core could create the rules for bigger blocks. Then the miners would eventually switch back to core because EC would be useless.

@_date: 2017-03-04 15:58:02
Yes, they *can*, but the majority won't. When there is a huge influx of transactions, everyone's mempool will generally get bigger. How is this so hard to understand?
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:14:40
Bitcoinaverage.com is messed up and therefore is messing up purse.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:11:13
Exactly, if it's just a one time payment then you now have 2 transactions with the LN. One for opening the channel, and one for closing. So in that scenario it would make sense to just use bitcoin as it works now.
Another solution would be to have everyone connected on the same LN hub, or between a few popular ones. But then we have centralization. This whole concept has not been properly thought out.
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:13:43


That's just a lie. Bitmain isn't responsible for Bitcoin.com, Slush, GBMiners or GoGreenLight... all of which are signaling for BU. Bitmain has a couple other pools, but how is that different from BitFury who single–handedly owns the largest amount of ASICs signaling for segwit?
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:02:55
Agreed, but the price no doubt went down because Hearn left and posted that article on medium. What the OP stated is very inaccurate.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:19:52
Also the price should be much higher by then so we won't need a whole lot of transaction fees to match the current level of security that we have today. The hashrate will be insanely high, which is a good thing.
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:49:38
The average size of everyone's mempool. Come on now...
@_date: 2017-03-26 11:14:26
Agreed. Lately people here have been saying the opposite.
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:16:59
LOL these comments are ridiculous. That last video is hilariously accurate.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:24:32
You have it backwards. Forking with the current BU hashrate and nodes would be an attack and would crash the price. Waiting for the overwhelming majority to be onbaord with larger blocks would be a protocol upgrade. Calling that an attack is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:42:45
Core has a lead developer, what's the difference?
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:06:27
That's a token betting if a hard fork will happen, not BTU.

@_date: 2017-03-22 10:03:38
The only thing you're trusting the 3rd party to do is broadcast your transaction. The only malicious thing they could do is ignore it in which case you can find another server to do it for you. Or download your own full node to broadcast it, but no need to store Bitcoin on it.
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:40:18


What evidence do you have of that?
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:17:59
So if Jihan was evil and on his last resort, you think he would start signaling with his main pool, and take the lead over segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:00:02
You don't think we have one already?
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:47:37
This isn't a free market either. They've already said no matter what that BCC will be BTC on Dec 31.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:37:36
Hypothetically, what if the price of BCU is higher than BCC on December 31st? Will BCC still be converted to BTC or will they get their own coin and then BTU will become BTC? If not, then this market seems incredibly biased right off the start. If there is no chance that BCU could become BTC then who would buy it?
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:00:53
Maybe another wave of attacks on people who didn't update.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:40:26
No, it doesn't make transactions smaller. It creates something called the "block weight", which effectively doubles the blocksize for all nodes running the latest versions of Core. This means your node would require 2x the bandwidth, storage and processing power. So are you ready for that or not? Or are you just saying stuff you don't mean to win an argument?
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:14:36
Oh I thought you meant an equal balance of hashrate. Yes the coin balance would be the same.
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:06:15
Good thing, why? This person has no authority over bitcoin classic and the article is entirely false.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:07:14
A block size increase has to be planned ahead so that everyone is in consensus. Core is wasting time for no good reason, and it's incredibly irresponsible. They FUD about the dangers of a fork, but the danger is mostly created by their unwillingness to act. All nodes running the current Core code will be kicked off the network in the future.
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:00:01
I wasn't talking about BU but okay. 27.8% is not overwhelming, that's all.
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:38:47
So people still use full nodes to store Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:37:49
Not true. BCC keeps it no matter what. Read the details.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:27:05
I still don't like either. If Core had a better scaling roadmap, I would be with them 100%.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:25:53


These still require P2SH transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. Basically alt-coins. People don't want to hold alt-coins.
This doesn't address the transaction limit.


That's not true. I've heard a lot of people say they want 1MB forever.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:16:11


Quite the accusation there. These "evil miners" were waiting on a 2MB increase of non-witness data which was promised by Core.


Or you know, remain in consensus with a bigger block size limit. Or any sort of compromise to help the block size grow. But now that Core is the minority, fuck consensus, right?
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:47:42
It was on the whalepool teamspeak, so there's no link.

@_date: 2017-03-23 16:26:10
Is there any way to reduce the risk of hacking? Since it's always in a "hot wallet". Are hardware wallets possible in any way?
@_date: 2016-06-29 04:58:32


Not at all. It would be comparing free block space to open seats in a coffee house. With full blocks, all the seats are taken and you can't get in unless you offer more money. It turns into a pointless bidding system. With a larger coffee house, everyone can get in at a fair price.
And no one is "hoarding" block space. [It has been increasing at a normal rate]( 
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:35:56
So I guess you can't run segwit either then.
@_date: 2017-03-25 08:13:38
Explain how a UASF is not a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:58:52
Who makes up these ticker "rules". Because when ETH hard forks it doesn't get a new ticker everytime. Is it just based on the devs and the github repo? Meaning core owns Bitcoin no matter what?
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:13:17


Exactly. So why are we prioritizing a complex solution over a simple blocksize increase? Both need to happen eventually.
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:38:35
No, USD is a better indicator here.
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:15:59

Circle heavily monitors your transactions and will close your account if your coins end up somewhere they don't like... such as localbitcoins. I wouldn't rely on them.
Hardware wallets are way better than paper wallets. There is no competition. Hierarchical deterministic, BIP 39 seeds, ease of use, security etc.
@_date: 2016-06-05 02:27:20
I have nothing against Coinbase but I have been using Gemini and it's pretty awesome.
@_date: 2017-01-19 15:05:33
Not at all in the same way though. This is more of an idea about people as a whole rather than gossiping about an individual.
@_date: 2016-06-29 13:13:10
The mainstream doesn't care so much about decentralization compared to us. They will use a coin that has 90% of the decentralization that bitcoin has because it's cheaper and faster. So at some point you have to think about making compromises to scale fast enough. A 2-4MB block size limit would not affect decentralization at all and would buy a lot of time to develop other solutions.
@_date: 2017-01-28 19:48:37
So just have a longer grace period after activation. Look how many nodes are running code older than 1 year; it's not much.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:41:32


Yes it is. Way simpler than segwit and LN. An altcoin (with a comparable node count to bitcoin) did it in less than 24 hours with no issues.


I did that a while ago. Evidence suggests that hard forks with a minimum required hashpower and grace period are more secure than soft forks.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:34:31
Except this is only good if multiple companies/people can use satellites to run nodes. Right now, blockstream has a monopoly on satellite nodes, effectively centralizing the blockchain for people who can only use satellites to connect. I'm not saying they are going to abuse it, but it's something to take into consideration. Hopefully other companies in the industry create some satellite nodes as well.


Did you mean another word besides anonymous? How are they making it anonymous?
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:36:11


What's the point in having access to the keys if you're not the only one? It's not multisig so if blockchain.info is hacked or pulls an exit scam, then your bitcoins are gone. You don't have full control.


Not true. Even without a hardware wallet you can set a password to encrypt your keys locally.
@_date: 2017-01-05 20:14:16
So all transactions are generated client side with javascript? If so, that's interesting, but I would never want my private keys being stored in my browser. Or have my unencrypted backups be sent to me over the internet.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:01:12
Agreed. It's exciting to think that the internet being shutdown will no longer be a threat to bitcoin, but I like to stay paranoid.
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:19:46

You should stop doing that and take control of your keys.
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:24:16
Wanting a bitcoin wallet to stay synchronized would be like wanting your paper bills to stay synchronized in separate locations. It can't be done securely or practically without a third party like coinbase... assuming you want send functionality on both your mobile and pc.
What you could do is get a hardware wallet like trezor and import it into Mycelium for mobile and Electrum for PC. That way, you'd be able to view your balances at any time on both devices and you can simply plug in your hardware wallet when you want to send bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:34:41
I don't think the miners are satisfied with what Core has done and are waiting for the Segwit + [2MB or greater] hard fork. If that doesn't happen, then they will continue to do nothing or look for alternatives. Or they could eventually be replaced by other pools who *are* voting for solutions.
People saying the miners haven't bothered yet or that it takes this long to update the mining software is BS imo. This has been the biggest issue in bitcoin for 2+ years. All of the largest mining pools have attended conferences and seem eager to find a solution to unite the community, scale bitcoin and end all this. If they were 100% pro SF segwit, then we would have seen it by now.
@_date: 2017-01-07 17:52:12
Yeah you could do that. Though, I would much prefer the security of a hardware wallet rather than typing in seeds on devices connected to the internet.

@_date: 2016-11-23 13:30:04

@_date: 2016-11-28 01:41:58
Yes, but they're not holding anyone hostage nor do they have a political agenda. Even though I think segwit should be activated, right now it is contentious with less than half of the network supporting it. A 2MB hard-fork after the release of segwit was an agreement that even *you* signed yourself.
* We will continue to work with the entire Bitcoin protocol development community to develop, in public, a safe hard-fork based on the improvements in SegWit. The Bitcoin Core contributors present at the Bitcoin Roundtable will have an implementation of such **a hard-fork available as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core within three months after the release of SegWit.**
* This hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, **including an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB**, with the total size no more than 4 MB, and will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:30:08
No segwit was released less than a year ago. You must be thinking of other proposals.

Quit making a fool of yourself. You're linking the mempool as if it is the total transaction rate. The tps is actually lower than usual today. This is occurring because there have been less blocks mined in the last 12 hours and because we've hitting the 1MB limit for almost a year now.

Right now, the minority of miners are signalling for segwit and the *majority* aren't. This could change but I'm just stating the facts.

Exactly. More transactions = more adoption = more nodes = more decentralization. The cost will slightly go up, but bitcoin's popularity will produce more nodes regardless.

Anyone with a shred of common sense saw this coming which is why there was so much urgency to deliver a small block size increase in core last year. So the miners would have time to reach consensus and upgrade in time before the limit was hit and to buy us time to develop other long term solutions *before* the next limit was hit.
But no, we've hit the 1MB wall and everyone is downplaying how big of a deal it is. I remember a few years ago when everyone was dying for bitcoin to get more adoption and a better rep, and now the narrative is "well we're not ready yet so everyone should stop using bitcoin for their particular use cases.". No, we should have never run into this problem. It damages bitcoin adoption catastrophically through bad word of mouth. We *do* still want adoption, right?

A compromise is what the miners *and* users want... we just want to get past this and scale bitcoin.
You are always so adamant about the negative effects of hard forks but "firing" the miners could only result in a hard fork. All this to stop a raise to 2MB? (which is what practically everyone wants). You really don't make any sense to me and you're really fitting your own quote: "Under mine the rules of Bitcoin to benefit us, or we'll screw with the network".

When you're this close to the ceiling of the blocksize limit, any sort of fluctuation will look like a spam attack. The tps wasn't actually that much higher than usual as you can see on the leftmost graph, we are just *that* close to max capacity. The fact that these "attacks" keep happening more and more often is just more proof that it is organic growth and one day we will hit a tipping point where the mempool won't be able to subside.

I'd say *much* better than no fork at all. A bunch of idiots (and bitcoin hard fork opponents) tried investing in ETC and it got them nowhere. The chain is continuing to die off. This should stop them from trying something like this in the future. But, you can't stop the actions of idiots.

How is giving the miners more power a compromise?
BIP 101 still makes the most sense. It just doubles the block size *limit* biyearly (not block size) to be safe. BIP 100 has a hard limit of 32MB, gives unnecessary control to the miners, and will need updating again.
There is really no point in diddling between 1MB - 32MB when we have a safe, future-proof, and hard limit that will fill according to the transaction volume.
@_date: 2015-08-29 14:55:56
I agree, the voting mechanism is pointless in any case, and only serves to give the miners more control.
A safe, growing, hard limit is the only viable option in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:34:49

Okay so lets say you're pouring water through a funnel at a consistent pace and everything is fine, there's no mess and the water remains at the same level inside the funnel. If you start pouring just a little more water, the funnel wouldn't take long before it overflowed. The same concept applies to the mempool. It only *looks* like a huge influx of transactions because it's piling on top of the maximum transaction limit. When in reality, it could just be a few percent more than that.

Do you think that some small hobbyist/hipster miners will continue to mine the original blockchain just to keep it alive?

No that's not what I said. They're not sure which transactions they can include in the block that aren't in the previous block, so they don't include any. They could always wait to validate the previous block but then there's a risk of another miner broadcasting the same block first.
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:53:23
This always happens seconds after a previous block is mined. It's because they have received the header from the previous block but haven't fully validated the transactions. So instead of uselessly hashing for a block that is already mined, they start looking for the next one. When they unexpectedly mine one in a few seconds they can either wait to validate the transactions in the previous block and risk losing the block reward, or mine an empty block. Antpool decides that it's safer to mine the block as quick as possible.

90% of people just buy the BTC ticker and have no idea about any forks. So your idea of listing it as a separate ticker and calling that the free market is wrong. Whatever coin is listed as BTC will always win, assuming nothing is fatally wrong with the protocol. So if exchanges can't reach a consensus then there will be a disaster.

I don't think anyone was claiming *all volume* was coins going back and forth. Obviously there are holders, no one is disputing that. The majority of volume is from day traders though. If it wasn't, we would see a price rise because the volume is much higher than the coins being mined.

It's not about getting the block size perfect in regards to the size of the network, it's about having a safe and practical maximum limit. It's about growing with *technology* and preserving the protocol.

@_date: 2016-10-18 20:23:06
Can you tell me your bitcoin receiving address that you used, or qr code? The fact that you're using bitcoin core means that you might not have a fully synced client. So you probably have the funds, but your wallet isn't showing it because the blockchain isn't fully downloaded. In the bottom right it should tell you how much time is left until it is fully downloaded. After that, you should send it to one of the wallets I recommended and stop using bitcoin core.
@_date: 2016-10-26 23:44:11
And then hardly anyone will be able to use it.
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:03:28
It's up to the miners to include transactions in the blocks. Right now the max they can do is 1MB of transactions per block. So if they do that then yes, all the blocks will be full until the mempool is cleared up. Some miners might create blocks smaller than 1MB for whatever reason.
@_date: 2016-10-18 19:49:44
If it scanned the QR code on your phone then yes you should have the bitcoin in your wallet. What wallet are you using?

You are aware that bitcoin core has a lead developer too, right?
This isn't a problem as long as there are a variety of different clients available. They can all follow the same protocol rules and adopt new features together, while having unique features that don't break everything.

The way I see it is if the block size was increased then this would happen a bit more often (hardly noticeable) and these blocks would serve no other purpose than adding confirmations to previous transactions. BUT, the blocks that *do* have transactions would effectively increase the average TPS way more than a rare empty block reduces it.

It was 4 seconds after the previous block which they hadn't fully validated yet. They had three options...
- Wait until the previous block was fully validated and risk losing the block reward.
- Include some lower fee transactions and risk mining an invalid block.
- Mine an empty block immediately and get the block reward with no risk.
Yes I know that the risk of waiting a few seconds is *very* small, but it's how they choose to do things.

Because you need to confirm that the transaction is connected with the right address. The merchants like bitpay would show you a message.

Except that site confuses minimum and maximum. With 8 MB blocks, the *maximum* space needed would be 420.48 GB per year, because blocks would be far from full. If they were always 100% full then you would need exactly that amount of storage, not minimum.
I don't see a problem with the other *maximum* constraints. With more transactions, bitcoin will become more popular and we will get more full nodes. Right now, submitting a few transactions every month is more expensive than running a full node.

I have been storing my credit card information in [1password]( for a long time and it is very secure with encryption. I don't see why storing bitcoin data in it would be a bad idea. Can even upload the keychain files to dropbox and it stays double password protected so you could access it anywhere.
