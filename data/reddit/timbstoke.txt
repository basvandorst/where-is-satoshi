Bought $150 worth from you so far, very impressed!

Faster Payments is indeed a recent innovation. First introduced in 2008, but didn't get really widespread for a few years after that. There's still some banks that don't support it.

Same here. At this rate, a 1BTC withdrawal will pay off my initial investment by the end of the day, and I'll have a few coins left which I'll let ride for a while.

sssh! The government don't know about Litecoin yet. Let's keep that one quiet until we see how they fuck up Bitcoin first.

How about that Seiboob? Does that turn you on? Well it shouldn't, because that's *my* Seiboob.

Its something to do with US politics that has made me take all my trades offline to enjoy the surge. Beyond that, I have no idea :-)

I thought _Gin_Bank_ sent her verification to the hackers, not you?

Not quite. I just tried a test order, and the restaurant I chose specified cash only, so presumably they're paying for advertising/order processing, rather than having takeaway.com take a cut of the payment. In that situation, Bitcoin is not available. 
Still a great step forward though.

+15 Doge
Edit: I don't actually have doge coins. I just couldn't resist.

I bought my first bitcoin a month and a half ago at £185. I traded maybe 10-15 coins over the course of a month until the price hit £450, sold the bulk of my holdings (which was only about 3 coins) at £820, made a healthy profit, and currently have about 0.7BTC remaining, which I'm either going to blow on SteamLoader or just keep hold of for when the market recovers.

This is why I've bought a few Litecoin. They've already doubled in price since I bought them a week ago. For a small investment it's got to be worth a gamble.

NOW being the operative word. Remember, this goes to congress TODAY. It only takes a bad decision for any US based company to decide its not worth trading, and in that situation, they may just disappear with your money before regulation comes in. 
Unlikely, but it's a possibility. Get that shit offline.

On behalf of men everywhere who can now take advantage of the steam sales without their partner commenting on the huge library of unplayed games already sitting there, thank you.
