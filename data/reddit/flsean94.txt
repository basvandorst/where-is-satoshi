I mean, everyone here has been looking for the smallest connection with the price going up. But none have really stuck. It has just been in a consistent downtrend. I mean, every now and then it'll fall so hard that it tries to pick itself up temporarily, but it doesn't look like bitcoins in the clear until something happens that's a real game changer. I know alot of people are really only here to profit, so from that standpoint, I wouldn't hope for much since it looks like the market is losing interest in that aspect. Not to say that the technology won't be incredibly beneficial in the future it really doesn't mean that the price will be ridiculously high like it was when the hype was up. Again, bitcoin can be 100-1000$ a coin and still be really useful someday
