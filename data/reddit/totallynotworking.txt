The point is that if miner can unilaterally force changes, bitcoin has failed.  
Leaving only the "most proof of work" paramenter, opens way to malicious actors (nation/states maybe) to just invest in a tons of asics and hijack the system completely.  What if they decide that coins not moved for 10 years can be claimed? Would that be "bitcoin" even with most proof of work?

Then difficulty adjustment would not work as intended anymore.   
Timestamps of blocks can be faked by miners, and average of block rate is used to calculate the next difficulty.  
The long retarget period of 2016 blocks prevents a single miner or a cartel to collude to skew the block timestamps.
A few non-colluding miners can prevent this voluntary skew.
By allowing a legitimate reason to postpone blocks it would open the gates to difficulty manipulations.

They cannot exactly because bitcoin is not defined as the most POW chain, but *the most POW chain that is valid*.  The original definition of "valid" by satoshi himself, is "valid for the reference client", with bugs and all.   
You then rightfully argue "who defines which is the reference client?" . 
In this context it is meant a bit like scientific consensus. Nobody is in charge of *science*. But over time a consensus on the status of some theory emerges.  Nobody argues today that general relativity is valid, but it has not been always the case. 
The definiton of "valid" cannot be expressed in exact terms, the same way you can not express the "validity" of every scientific theory with a fixed set of terms.  The key here is *consensus*, represented by miners, users, exchanges, merchants, and developers, in no particular order.   Like for scientific consensus, there is not a magic number that separate consensus from non-consensus, but when you see consensus you know. Like finding love.

It's not just "bigger UDP packets". And proves my point.
SPDY multiplexes multiple TCP sessions in an UDP stream.  And implements congestion control and retransmission optimized for the underlying traffic. . They reimplemented the last level. 
This is even more complex than TCP connection, for a somewhat modest improvement in latency. And it is *good* because it enables use cases that were not possible before.
EDIT: SPDY has been standardized as HTTP2, IIRC.

It's a feedback loop that you can't predict. The difficulty oscillations and the EDA are being used to accelerate the creation of coins. Sooner or later, this will reflect in the market. 


Not really, otherwise 100% of the hashrate should have switched. 
But, guess what, it didn't happen. And bch is more profitable only after repeated EDA, and after the rise in price.
25% of the sha256 hashrate could rewrite the whole fork in a little more than 10 days, and if the EDA game continues, it will be even easier. Do you think that it is nation/ state adversary resistant?

It's like trying to define the true love :)
Nobody can tell you a set of rules to find it, but you will know when you have found it.

Segwit activated two days ago and there were already 3 independent and interoperable implementations of LN.
Yeah, those are only useful for developers right now, but do you really want to deploy code on a 70 billion $ network with two days of real-world testing? 
Do you know how much time is necessary for a protocol to be standardized? do you know how many people worked on the TCP/IP specs and how much time it took?  
 
TCP/IP has not survived 40 years by being rushed out. 
Having segwit active on mainnet will allow a great number of developer work to integrate it in the coming months, while working out the kinks and interoperability. Then the specs will be ready, and the user-friendly implementations will take place.
Good secure long lasting protocols take years to standardize, but then they allow unforeseen possibilities. Who would have tought of bittorrent while defining IP packets?
Meanwhile you can use one of the many altcoins with less transaction fees, manifesting your dissent with your money.
The system is designed to be used like that. Don't like it for the fee? use something with less fee. Do you want maximum security? hold BTC. Or a mix of the two. Your call.

They can close the channel.

Because we have just activate something that allows 100000x scaling.  
It's like upgrading a 10 mbps DSL connection to 20 mbits while you had 1gbps fiber just installed.

If i told you "i have a printer that prints genuine money, and i can use it covertly", would you believe that i'm not using it?

If you work in the tech world you will know that the test environment is not the same as the real world.  
What would be in your opinion the best course of action now? just release the software as-is and if coins get lost... fuck it? 
Besides, you can't really test the scaling of LN in testnet. You need *real scale* for that.

He thinks that an hard fork should bundle a lot of other improvement that can't be rushed and require a lot of testing.

Try to implement it securely on bitcoin cash then....
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:21:41
Those are block rewards. This is an early miner.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:22:36
Segwit would have been activated years ago if not for stalling of miners who did not want to lose asicboost advantage... By now we would have working and tested LN.
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:07:54
I feel this should be a top level comment.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:25:20
Yes! i've been saying that UDP is obviously better than TCP. Why bother with congestion control, retransmissions, path MTU, it's all unneeded complexity!
Just use larger UDP packets!

20000$ nodes for eveyone!

Oh no, many "mainstream" technologies that were not ready for mainstream, died prematurely because were pushed too soon.  Think 3d TVs, we'll see about virtual reality.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:28:23


He did not say it is easy. It's not!
Segwit has been active only for a few months and you cant  fuck up a 100 billion dollars network with untested and unproved software.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:51:42
No, the guy you replied to doesn't understand how the thing works.
Computational power and transaction througput are independent.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:50:04
With "trusted nodes". I can solve that too by abandoning censorship resistance, decentralization and immutability: just use a SQL server.

For 1.75 BTC, take it to professional data recovery services.
Recuva, if not used correctly, might make the situation worse.
@_date: 2017-09-04 07:05:42
Find your old hard drive, and search for the wallet file there.  
Take it to a data recovery company if it doesnt work anymore.  
If you do not have a backup, that's the only way to recover your BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-06 06:40:26
If the disk is damaged, it might fail completely during recuva scan, or during heavy activity.
1.75 btc might be worth not taking that risk.

"more nodes" are useful only if truly decentralized. 
 The same prebuilt image running tens of times on the same host, or under the same guy's control, or depending on the same connection, or the same storage, or the same CPU, ups the node count, but for the *purpose* of decentralization, is utterly useless.
Would you ever save your backups *on the same host, on the same disk* of your live data? No because the *purpose* of the backup is not to have two copies, but to *save your ass when something fails*.
The *purpose* of decentralization in Bitcoin is to make the system resilient to all kinds of problems. From hardware problems, to configuration problems, to political problems.
What if the docker template has a mass-exploitable vulnerability? What if the whole datacenter goes down? 
Besides, you have to absolutely trust the Docker image creator. And bitcoin is not based on trust.
