If bitcoin is money, stealing it is illegal. That's not hypocrisy and prosecuting theft is not regulation.

The problem with making local government "controllable" is that very few crazy people can then do very crazy things. Small homogeneous communities are where you get laws forbidding beards or instituting elements of Sharia. 
That's why the choices local governments can make are constrained by higher levels of government - because Arizona would genuinely love to bring back discrimination, and we shouldn't need state-by-state laws about which races can marry which. 
The purpose of the federal government is to provide some reliable baseline that a huge and diverse population can agree on. The first amendment is a universally good idea - but Ron Paul doesn't think it protects you from your state or city creating an official religion.

"Fed shouldn't interfere" is Ron Paul's opinion on literally everything. Sodomy bans? Feds shouldn't interfere. Environmental disaster? Feds shouldn't interfere. Explicit endorsement of religion by the states? Feds shouldn't interfere.

They're actively considering how they'll extract a cut. One of Bitcoin's primary aims was to do away with systems like Paypal.

Because this is his stance on literally everything. He is an antifederalist. He thinks the federal government should do basically jack-shit, which means states would be allowed to do whatever asinine or bigoted shit they want without restriction. Ron Paul's ideal America would be a place where Texas still arrests gay people, Virginia still nullifies interracial marriages, and every state would be free to enforce an official religion.
[He is not exactly shy about these issues.](

Cheapskate pirates don't somehow devalue the money that legitimate users send you. Two thousand customers and millions of pirates is objectively better than one thousand customers and thousands of pirates.

Fuuuuck no. PayPal is part of why Bitcoin was developed. They're an absolutely terrible business, founded by a Randroid lunatic who openly dismisses the need for competition.

It seems *I* don't realize that? Au contraire, buffalo breath. It seems *he* doesn't realize that no level of American government is allowed to violate citizens' constitutional rights. That includes state governments. That includes county governments. That includes city governments. 
The viewpoint he's pushing predates the civil war and has been thoroughly dismissed by the Supreme Court through a century of precedent.

Twitter has an effect they can see. Bitcoin's effect is more hidden, largely by design... and the recent surge in its price is almost entirely due to idiots who think it's a pyramid scheme treating it like a pyramid scheme and hoping to god almighty that they get out before the bubble pops. 
But yeah, two years from now, Twitter will be worth fuck-all and Bitcoin will be slightly higher than it was in June of this year.

Obviously it's possible for anyone to start issuing physical bitcoins - like silver certificates, you just issue them as you buy the relevant capital. Would you use them, though? Would anyone have any use for them that wasn't served by their existing physical currency?

This is even news-friendly, since they're just selling computer hardware. It's a microchip that sits there and does math. No company should have any reason to object to that - certainly not to the extent of terminating a contract without warning.

Easy patronage without going through skeezy companies like PayPal would silence a lot of crap about horrible advertising being necessary to to keep websites going. Instead of throwing popups or begging for t-shirt sales or whatever, popular sites could rely on a small portion of users to directly donate. 
It's already possible - but it requires aforementioned skeeze or trusting the site with your credit card info. Bitcoins are more like digital cash. It's trivial to throw some at whatever you're enjoying when a generous moment strikes you.
