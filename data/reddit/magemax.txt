It's OK, there is a 30% chance that the guy saying the stupid statement was trolling, and only half of the people here that do not know better will believe him.

measuring short term risk yeah. Even using the past volatility to predict the future volatility is relatively sound.
But extrapolating the returns is the part that makes absolutely no sense, and that causes that the blog post is just a complicated way of saying : "If we assume that bitcoin continues to do on average +1000% a year, it's gonna go up".

Just this particular simulation though.  The standard used for pricing uses the risk-neutral distribution (with an average of zero instead of an average of "historical average performance", to make it simple.)

The worst is that he actually says in his title "You won't believe the results".
Well unless your results show something else than a lognormal distribution of trend the historic yearly growth and variance the realized yearly volatility, they won't surprise anyone who knows what you're doing.

So 8 years of crazy growth?

When it comes to making any prediction on any financial asset, chartism sucks.
There is hundreds of years of data, and no statistical significance found in any tactic. It's financial astrology.
And as you say, add a layer of unpredictability when it comes to BTC  cause the asset is somehow unprecedented.

If it stops increasing, doesn't it mean that the transactions have stopped?

Isn't the slope... decreasing ?  Not sure it's a very uplifting graph

1 block every 10 minutes (assuming the above comment is true) ==&gt; The number of blocks mined every 22 minutes is a Poisson distribution of parameter 2.2
Thus, there is ~0.002% chance for this event to happen in any 22 minutes sequence.  And the event should occur 0.47 times a year. Which kind of matches the observed rarity of the event, but is not impossible. Now seeing 14 blocks in the same time frame of 22 minutes should already be very rare (once every 100 years), and don't hope seeing anymore in your lifetime.
The model assumes that the number of miners working is constant during all day, which might not be true.

Amazing. Every word of what you just said was wrong (except "And").
