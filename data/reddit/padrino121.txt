Like others I am lost regarding the time savings, if you are in a SWIFT country you can move fiat between accounts with a few hours of delay, minutes if you have the right level of service... If in the US it can be same day if the wire is handled properly, and may or may not require a fee, it could also be SWIFT if you use US banks which participate...
You point about "classic wire transfer" is inaccurate based on the time you quote, you are referring to ACH, and actually that is most likely what an exchange uses to deposit into your bank as it is lower cost on average, but it also means the exchange has a deposit delay...

This is irrelevant to the discussion at hand, how can you possibly think a completely unrelated comparison involving theft is related to the conversation about increasing the block size?
While i can agree with some of what you are doing the above posts have done more to dig you into a hole than defend your position.

Wondering the same, I guess it's totally different but I'm giving a 28 year old a $150K/yr offer in a few days.. He's 28 though so I suppose it is a poor comparison :)

I gave up on Coinbase a long time ago, use Circle now and it's been great..

Sounds like there is blame to go around, if I read the first part correctly the CTO of OKCoin had a gentleman's agreement with Roger on behalf of the company. Bad form..

I must have missed something in all of this.. They are forcing equity onto their customers as the long term plan instead of trying to make them whole? Unless I am off base shouldn't we see a lawsuit or two pop up soon?

Thanks for running the numbers... It's a sad disgrace.. Especially given the old postings of "insurance" and the like..

The Bitcoin in that wallet is only secure as the password protecting it in this case, which implies a direct assault on you is the easiest way to break it.

Glad you are keeping up on it.. I noticed their hash rate decrease a healthy amount as they have been pulling units to ship to customers. It's straight forward fraud and I hope customers get the compensation they deserve.

I would love the opportunity to purchase like that, but I have run afoul of that policy myself and in short it's because they lose positive control over the payment chain and cannot support buyer and seller protection. If Paypal ever gets around to accepting Bitcoin with what would amount to a built in escrow service than I suspect ebay will come around.

The tone of the blog post itself implies he doesn't think he really did anything wrong and would do it again if another opportunity came along... Disappointed in the post...

While you have a valid point about the layperson, getting a peer review is good practice so in that regard I would say you are flat wrong by implying other experts should not review.
