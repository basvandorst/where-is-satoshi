According to ICO this problem exists also. Platforms like crowdfunding platform Descrow can help for ICO market. Also there is a demand for coinmarket

This could be avoided if the ICO were conducted through special services, such as Descrow.

I think that cryptocurrency market in next 5 years will be at risk. One of the main reason - scam tokens, because of ICO. Special crowdfunding secure platforms, giving investors control could prevent in. May be Descrow?

If more and more goods will be sold for bitcoin - the bubble will never burst.

I think, that so fast growing of BCH is smth very speculative. Trying to buy BCH for 2000 much guys lost their money. I like Descrow project it looks like transparent and save idea. They want to change ICO market.

It's not too late to start buying a crypto currency. And you should never regret the loss of profits. You just need to draw conclusions from this.

Where can I buy one? Or make a print? You can arrange the production of goods with cryptomatics. I like it when the logo of companies look cool. For example, like Descrow.
