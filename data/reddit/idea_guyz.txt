I got mine through shift which connects to my Coinbase account,you can also add Dwolla as a funding source. Great thing is that it allows you to choose whichever wallet(Ltc, Eth, Btc, and Im 67% sure on USD wallet as well), but switching the wallet is kinda a drag.

Shiftpayments.com then click connect and follow the process. Costs ten bux paid via Dwolla or whatever your funding source will be. Also has an app but website is easier to navigate

Very welcome, I spent hours looking and some stopped serving my country or crazy high fees. Only complaint I have about shift is only a 200 daily cash withdraw... Really wished tenX came through, rather visa/Mc.

Hmmm, we would have to look at all of his comment history to see number of times a food item was mentioned to see how unique this value is

Not his bank account. And if it is, the funds were obtained in an illegal manner. Why else pay 10% to some dude for nothing? Not worth the risk, but 1500 a week... More exchanges need to get a Fiat gateway

Yea, but if this is true and if/when media outlets report on this they will word it so it sounds like it's a bitcoin issue not a coinbase issue.

Man, it would be nice to be able to track Exchange wallets to see who's the daddy whale and baby whales. There's a guy out there batting  .840 on only btc. Those exchanges could probably do five minutes of equations and find out who the Market Movers are, actually you wouldn't even need 5 minutes. Now that exchange looks at their other exchanges to see how many of these bug whales there.., ya herd?
