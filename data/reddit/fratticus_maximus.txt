Thank god you have experiences with Schwab and bitcoin. I've been buying BTC on coinbase from my Schwab account. This is my main, "Nexus" account that ties all of my other bank accounts together. I would make things very annoying if they decided to shut my schwab account down. Thanks for data point.

Sounds like the OneCoin MLM bullshit.

Awww, I have a 10 trillion Zimbabwe banknote. I'm thinking of buying some Weimar Republic and Argentina currency and making a collage and call it "the reason I'm buying Bitcoins."

OneCoin had been hosting a bunch of webinars, marketed on websites like Eventbrite. They marketed themselves as the "next Bitcoin" and "seeing sizable returns on your money." I saw an event in Austin, TX and decided to a quick google search. Just reading about some of the sales pitches, intimidation tactics, appeal to authority, etc made me cringe so hard. It was so evidently a pyramid scheme/mlm that if you couldn't do your shallow due diligence of research and being knowledgeable, I almost don't feel bad for you for falling for it.

Look at this peasant with only a 5 billion note. I'm sitting here with a 100 Trillion note. Come at me.

I have not see any violence directed at the bitconnect people. Those people were committing outright fraud, stealing millions from the average idiot investor. If anyone is going to commit violence, it's idiots; yet here we are: no one involved with bitconnect has been assassinated. Ver is sleezy and deceptive  but it's no where near the level of blatant illegality with bitconnect. When heads start rolling from that, I'll believe this.

This girl I met worshipped Tony Robbins. She kept on going on and on about how she was paying people thousands of dollars to train her in some vague human development bullshit and that it's the system of "coaching" pioneered by Tony Robbins. Supposedly he coined the term "coaching." With this training, she told me she "cured" numerous people with Psychological problems when trained psychiatrists failed. She said it was "the results that mattered" and it didn't matter if she was trained. She had a Facebook business page listing her as "life coach." My bullshit meter was going into the stratosphere by this point. Later on she asked me which credit card has a 0% balance transfer since she had 20-30k in credit card debt from paying for these "coaching" sessions. It's like a glorified mlm that she was involved in. I don't know if this is the stuff Robbins actually peddles or this was just same scammers trying to ride his coat tail; either way, it's scammy as shit
