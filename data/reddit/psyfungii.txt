Like many things, there's a good idea originally/in theory, but government and legislation are just too blunt an instrument to deal with it in practice.
I used to work in Taxation software.  The US introduced ["FATCA"]( law which was also aimed at money laundering and hiding taxable assets offshore.
FATCA forces Financial Institutions GLOBALLY to report on all their US citizens who hold more than $X with them, including balances and income.  So if you're a *European* bank, or hedge fund, if you have a client who is a US citizen, you, the bank, are required by *US Law* to report that citizen's balances and income in your accounts to the IRS.  
Now, the not unsurprising but unintended(?) consequence of FATCA was that the European governments saw all the banks scrambling to produce reports on US citizens for the US government, and they all said "hey, we'd like to know what our *European* citizens are up to, so, yeah, how about you report all your citizens to us now as well" and thus was born the **global** [Common Reporting Standard]( where financial institutions across the world are now sending reports about all their clients to each client's respective government.
Because Bitcoin isn't held by a financial institution governments will now be looking for some way to plug this hole in their "we know everything about you" laws.
