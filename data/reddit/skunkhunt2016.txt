Is not a forced taxation as your gov is trying to push over you every year... is just voluntarily funding for things people want, in a decentralized way.   
This is the beauty of Bitcoin and decentralized voluntary funding: even people like you that doesn't want to participate with funds, will/can use the result of the funding.  
Forced taxation on the other side, is when everybody is forced to pay for something that majority do not want to pay and use, by some few people.  
If there will be a decentralized campaign of funding for a war, somewhere on this planet, you will be surprised that not so many people (as you think) will participate in that funding.

100% the seed is wrong. If you still have the old one open, check the seed again.
@_date: 2019-01-12 22:30:30
Do this to test:  
1. Go to  save the page offline, create your own seed.  
2. Open Samourai, use the seed to import, done  
3. Open Electrum, use derivation path 49, import the seed, done  
4. Make a small tx to one of the wallet address. See if in both showed up. It will, because I tested before.  
5. You could use that BIP39 seed to any other wallet that supports BIP39.

1. As P2P money and HODL what remains. I don't give a shit about price.  
2. I already use it, but I will never carry with me more than personal expenses (beer, tampons for my GF and taxi). If I really need more than that, I always carry in my head (memorized) a seed of a larger wallet (not my life HODLings, but enough for larger buys). All the rest of BTC stays safe, saved in many different places.  
3. I don't give a shit about any other shitcoins.

The multisig wallet have limitation of use ONLY when is about to SPEND FROM not when is about to SEND TO.  
so everybody can send whatever they want, whenever they want to that wallet.  
The question should be is how they will spend from a 5/5 multisig. They have to sign each one with their key in order to have a valid spend tx.  
In a 5/5 multisig is normal a 3/5 requirement to sign an output tx, 5/5 is too insane.

Then use any Android wallet that supports BIP39 seed and after each tx, just delete the app.  
electrum, Samourai, Mycelium, BLW, Blue Wallet, BRD all of those supports BIP39.  
BTW, Blue wallet, have a nice feature: plausible deniability. You should try it. Hides your real wallet into an encrypted space on your mobile. Any other fake password will open an empty wallet, hiding your real wallet. Only if you put the real password will open the real one.  
I agree with you that the best password is your seed. I also remember my seed. But not all. I have many wallets/seeds.

3. Make exchanging goods and services a real free market, using Bitcoin as P2P money, with no censorship, no rules, no embargo, no political speech, no birders, no limits  
4. Give back to the people the power of controlling/creating own money and not being enslaved by evil banksters, forever in debt.

Remember this: Bitcoin is decentralized, so there will be no way to have a real statistic about Bitcoin usage. And that is damn good!  
We don't care, we just use it as P2P money! Statistics are another part of "masters" control.... over sheeple masses.

You can't be outraged about what they are doing in that webshit page. It's their web and is their right to put whatever they want.

I have to try now with the new version that is supporting Docker container and emulate a linux VM. But I would like to have a simple click to install app as BTC node. NAS are a great potential for being used as node for BTC and LN.

I use regularly these (the order is not important):  
Samourai, Electrum, BlueWallet, BTC LN wallet, Eclair, Schildbach wallet, Mycelium, Coinomi.  
For example I have the same segwit wallet used in BlueWallet and Electrum (mobile/desktop). In this way the coin control can be managed better.  
Normally if a wallet doesn't support a BIP39 import (I use [this tool offline]( to generate my own) I don't even bother with it.

@_date: 2018-12-23 14:11:59
Because Bitcoin IS P2P money and freedom. Is the biggest invention in human history because it's separate money from gov/banks.  
Satoshi took the power of creating/controlling money from the banks/govs and give it to the people. I will not throw away that power by going back to spend fiat. I am dumping fiat when I buy BTC. I make stronger BTC when I use it as money.
@_date: 2018-12-23 15:05:06

Nope. Adoption means more people using it directly. That means my local grocery store should accept it and make more txs with BTC, paying his employees in BTC until the damn fiat **DIE**!
@_date: 2018-12-23 14:40:58


LOL are you reading what you write? Adoption = use  
Bitcoin is in the same time store of value and money.  
[Satoshi's papers]( Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.  
There is no mention of HODL, store of value etc.

90% of all people I gave BTC in the past, they don't use it/lost it/ignore it. The 10% were already knowing something and those are real bitcoiners now.  
That's why starting from this year will gift only Andreas books Internet of money so people start learning first about Bitcoin and if they come back with good questions, I will give them free satoshis onchain or LN.
@_date: 2018-12-22 09:32:50
OpenNode IS an institution that act as an intermediary in a BTC tx. Bitcoin was created exactly to avoid that.
@_date: 2018-12-23 12:04:31
Andreas books are also gifts. At least they can learn something. I saw many people throwing away the papers with BTC seeds, ignoring or consider it a joke.  
But a book once they read it they will realize what really is BTC and then they are ready to receive some BTC.  
If in your case they are already introduced to BTC and already have some satoshis in their wallet, that is fine to gift them some more. But not to total noobs.
@_date: 2018-12-23 11:50:37
Giving BTC for free to a person that have no idea what is all about is wrong nowadays...  
I already bought 10 books of Andreas Internet of Money and I will give them this Christmas to 10 totally noobs. Then if they come back to me and ask more questions maybe I will give them some BTC as a reward for good questions.

This happen when people use **an intermediary** as Bitpay for their BTC payments.  
Bitcoin was created EXACTLY to avoid these intermediaries. People should just reject to use BTC payments through intermediaries! Otherwise just stick with the shit fiat.

ProofOfKeys is a great movement and should be continued with **ProofOfMoney** - each person to go to their bank and request **in cash** all their money. Then buy BTC with that cash and of course apply ProofOfKeys.  
But I raise a question to Trace Mayer here:  
[Why you are still supporting Bitpay, being an investor]( knowing that Bitpay is the enemy of Bitcoin and also **is against ProofOfKeys** ? Something don't add up well here.
