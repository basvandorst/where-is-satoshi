I feel for you, my business (username relevant) has had a number of chargebacks over the past couple of years. Nothing worse than losing a few hundred dollars to some ass on the internet, especially when its a product that took hours to create by hand. The worst part? Of all of the chargebacks that we've had, my guess is maybe 1 was actually legit. 
This is why we offer a continuous 5% discount to anyone paying with BTC! We also keep those sales in BTC, we don't cash out to dollars.

Thanks for the post!
You can pay using BTC directly through our online shop (we're set up with BitPay), or if you send us an email with your order details (what you'd like to buy, what your shipping address is), we'd be happy to offer a 15% discount for anyone paying with BTC!
(We'll make up an invoice for you privately to include the discount, since our shop code doesn't include a way to give discounts based on payment method).

We use Shopify, and offer a 5% discount to customers paying in BTC, through a coupon code (BITCOIN5). 
The problem is, Shopify doesn't have the coding to discriminate coupon code use based upon payment method. This means that some people will use this coupon and then pay with paypal or credit card. So, everywhere our website mentions the coupon, we explicitly state that it is only allowed to be used with bitcoin, and that using it incorrectly (i.e. with paypal) will result in your order being cancelled and refunded.
There have been some orders that use it incorrectly, I cancel them, and send the customer an email explaining that bitcoin is the cheapest and most secure payment method in our shop, so we pass the savings along to our customers. I also mention that if they re-place the order properly we'll have it shipped out asap for them. 
This seems like it might piss customers off, but so far everyone has re-placed their order when this happens, so it hasn't led to any lost business.
Hope that helps!

That is an unfortunate thing to have happen, but I still feel that businesses are too vulnerable using payment methods such as Paypal. Way too easy to be scammed.
Established businesses have a reputation to protect, so their is a heavy incentive for them to not commit fraud. For new businesses it is good to have buyer protection, but the best defence is being a savvy shopper online. Unfortunately everyone will probably run into some sort of mishap/fraud at some point, as there is no 'perfect system' as of yet.

Yes this is absolutely true, but as a savvy business owner it is not hard to take measures to protect yourself against fraud. Requesting samples, or placing a small order to build trust are simple ways to protect yourself as a buyer. 
In my experience, there are more buyers committing fraud then there are sellers. It is easier to take steps to avoid fraudulent seller than it is to avoid fraudulent buyers (using systems such as Paypal, which a *huge* portion of the internet relies on currently). I don't disagree with your points, I just think that the currently popular payment systems are weighted too heavily towards buyer protection, thus making it easier for buyers to commit fraud.

Shameless self promo alert:
We're a company that keeps 100% of bitcoin purchases stored as btc. This is largely because purchases made using btc are a small part of our total sales, but nonetheless we're holding out in hopes that one of our suppliers will begin accepting btc in the future. 
Right now our shop is out of stock, but within a day or two we'll be stocked up again! We offer an everyday 5% discount to anyone paying in btc - just use the code 'bitcoin5' at checkout!

They're great toys! If you have any interest I would encourage you to pick on up! Our shop is sold out of cheaper options for kendamas right now, but there are lots of other online shops with great selection!
Edit: Also, my old room-mate subscribed to Mantry. Really cool idea, you guys delivered some tasty stuff! I just sent him a message to tell him you started accepting BTC.

Given the volatility I think it makes sense for businesses with large daily transaction volumes to convert back to fiat currency at this time, but as volatility decreases it will likely be more commonplace for companies to hold reserves in BTC. 
Our company accepts BTC and keeps it in BTC, but BTC sales are not a major source of our revenue by any means.

I know! I've been travelling a bit the last few months, and always seemed to be out of town exactly when BEMU was happening! I've moved out to Vancouver now, but hopefully I'll be back to visit when another meet up is happening!

None actually, we accept CAD and BTC ;)
@_date: 2016-02-26 06:04:19
Very true, niche on niche! We honestly didn't expect many orders to come in, but wanted to support btc nonetheless!
