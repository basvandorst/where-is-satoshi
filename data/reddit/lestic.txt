I think this is a good concept however I'm not sure about the length of the terms, maybe shorter ones would also be good.  One thing to take into account that I don't think people realize too much is the difficulty will more or less be constantly going up and will slowly cut into the profits if the price does not increase to reflect the change.

Admittedly I'm sitting with the bASIC crowd I dislike how it seems convenient how these problems keep happening - I honestly think a lot of the problems didn't just pop up suddenly.
With that being said with regards to the bASIC units Tom said either wait till January or we'll process your refund.  Both products have missed their ship dates about twice now?  But BFL is always hush hush about refunding.
Regardless it will only be a matter of time until ASIC's appear.  There was so much doubt about the Bitforce Single yet I have one sitting beside me hashing away.  I guess it'll still be relevant until the new year at least.

I totally agree it is behind on bids - most of the time.  Usually there's a few hours of lag time behind say Mt.Gox to virtex which sometimes helps.  I'm honestly guessing the situation with Gox is that because they are mostly a USD exchange even though it offers CAD they probably don't hold much in reserves in terms of our currency.

I would try  you can sell them to Jeremy who runs the site.  There are fees attached to it but you are dealing with Paypal.
I have used this service on two occasions, 1 for purchasing a Newegg.ca gift card, and another I requested $50 USD through paypal.  The transaction went pretty smoothly you receive a quote and an address to send the payment to, a few hours later I got paid.  I highly recommend it.

While Mt.Gox is the largest exchange their CAD section is a little lacking.  Try cavirtex for a Canadian exchange and one that certainly doesn't lack funds (in CAD).

The NFC chips used are an NTAG203, which is supported by pretty much every phone that has NFC on the market (Blackberry, Nokia Lumias, Galaxy S3's etc). If you can survive not having them embedded in a ring they cost less than $1.

Sort of, but not totally. The tag must be encoded in a format phones recognize. Standard NDEF supports things like entering a preset phone number into your dialer, or opening a web page when you come into contact for it. More specialized applications like a "task manager" program tags outside of their specification and can only be read by devices that have that application on them.
Samsung makes a door lock that can be opened by NFC which there are videos on Youtube of people unlocking doors with them however if you were to tap your phone to the chip don't expect it to do anything for you.
