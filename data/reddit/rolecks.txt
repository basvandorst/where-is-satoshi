Bought 2 years of VPN from Private Internet Access by accident (meant to buy 1). The refund was so much faster than a normal purchase. Plus I got back .0001 too much so I made money! BRB gonna start a new bitcoin business!!

As someone who just left Korea after 3 years...DAMN I would have loved this!
Great idea, I hope it takes off! I've already sent this info to a few friends still over there.

Wallet backup/restore question. So if I have 3 backups, a, b, c (c is the newest). What happens if I lose b and c? Would I be totally fucked? If I tried restoring a, would that even work? Or would my wallet be unrecoverable without the transactions from b,c?

Can someone go a bit more in depth for me regarding that statement? I understand the difference in the wiki between light and full nodes, but that last part. Why does using a full node for my own transactions contribute more than just running a full node on it's own and verifying other's transactions?

So Overstock sold them the bond, but since it's all new and scary and stuff they also "loaned" them 5 mill hoping this shit all works out in the end, or they can basically keep it if it doesn't?

Oh this looks very cool! I think I'll stop by and wander around. What kind of things are you selling at your stall?
