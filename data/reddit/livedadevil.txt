Market cap means nothing.
If Bitcoin goes up $1000 that means it's market cap went up $16000000000

I just remind people I'm still up over 100% on crypto and that they probably lost more in lottery tickets than they'd care to admit

Jesus the circle jerk in here is strong

Probably just cracking down on the kind of corruption that doesn't benefit him

Honestly there's only 2-3 cryptos I see surviving past 2019.
Bitcoin cus it's the grandpappy, eth because the ethereum network has so much potential outside of just a currency, and then one microtransactions-based coin (possibly Litecoin)
None of the bit-forks will.

If anything, lightning should drive price down.
If Bitcoin is used as a currency rather than a store of value, what happens to all the hodlers?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:48:18
No one buys Bitcoin to use it lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:16:09
A yes good comrade

Probably just downloads uploaded pastes and sorts with a script by username

If bitcoin hits $100k by the end of 2018 I'll eat progressively spicier peppers on video until I puke.
I expect MAYBE 45-60k

I'm a proud holder of 0.015 Bitcoin sir
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:38:39
This is why I can't take people seriously when they say Bitcoin will hit $200k by 2019.
If it does, it means something is wrong with USD not that something is right with bitcoin

Canadian prices today man

I'm just going anecdotally. Most people I know under 30 barely use credit but those above 30 use it almost exclusively

The larger the company the longer any changes or updates take to go through and get approved.
Hell, most hospitals are still running Windows XP because important software hasn't been updated to use anything newer.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:48:43
I switched my small amount of Bitcoin into eth expecting a small dip after 10k to buy back into. Hopefully I'm not dumb

I mean, in Canada at least most people I know use debit unless they have to order online, then it's with credit and repaid quickly. My parents generation however is 90% credit based.
I think growing up in a shitty economy made people smarter for once

Doubtful. No way people wouldn't cash out at 9 million. You could live off interest at that point

Picture of the exact moment on coinbase down to the cents: [lovely](
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:29:17
So did this break coinbase? It's sitting exactly at $10,000.00 for a relatively long while
Edit: just fixed itself. Weird
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:32:47
Could be the one
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:35:20
It means anyone with say over a hundred thousand in btc is gonna have hell when trying to cash out.
Missing the moment by a minute could cost tens of thousands
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:25:34
Couple exchanges are down, people could be cashing out with tons of money
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:41:31
But then what will? It's the same as people who win big at the casino, they keep going to win even bigger until they have no more winnings.
You have to have a realistic out point and it will never be ideal
