All this worthless paper in my pocket needs to be converted to juicy bitcoin as soon as possible!

I'll look into that one as well. Thanks.

Thanks for the directions man, I'm going to try linking BTX Trader and BTC-E together tomorrow and continue working on buying and selling my first Bitcoin... hopefully, the rest of the problems to come will also be ones that I can get around!

Yes, I know, but aren't using exchanges much quicker? The reason I want to use them is so I can take advantage of a short term rise/fall in the market. For ex. the value of BTC going from 370.00 USD to 390.00 USD in about an hour in which I buy one BTC when it is at 370 USD and sell one BTC when it is at 390 BTC. I'm not trying to make any real money(yet) I just want to see if I'm capable of making like ten bucks off of this just to see what it is like.

Will it be a hard time because of my age? Because I would be fine saving    up my USD balance on the site, then withdrawing it when I turn 18... it's not that far off.

So I can actually sell BTC on that site? Without going through some ridiculous verification process that shits on me because I'm not an official adult?

Can Coinkite be used if you are under 18?

Man child gamers like to downvote facts when they're triggered by them, sorry bud

Definitely seems like this is the case.
