Greeks with big savings know how to open a bank account in the EU or how to buy real estates in London and Berlin ... the rest is fine with cash.
@_date: 2015-06-20 12:24:45


It only shows where the Euro bill is printed and not every Euro zone country prints all bills. 1 Euro = 1 Euro :)

You're completely right, but hey, they had 5 years to withdraw their money ... shouldn't be a real problem now.
@_date: 2015-06-20 12:30:52
@_date: 2015-06-20 12:26:31
Why? Bitcoins are currently completely useless in Greece. Just withdraw your Euros to a foreign bank or from an ATM.
@_date: 2015-06-21 08:26:28
Because cash is different from book money. There won't be Bitcoins and book Bitcoins. You simply have Bitcoins or you don't. Second, nobody needs a bank if you have a wallet. Third, private banks can't print (book) money any longer by just signing a loan.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:34:50
Great :)
@_date: 2015-06-20 12:21:08
You're completely right!
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:56:49
Why should some hide his savings? The Greeks had 5 years to withdraw their money. Shouldn't be a problem now.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:02:53
Sounds too aggressive. 982 terabytes in 21 years? What does Moore's law say?
@_date: 2015-06-20 13:02:58
If Greece leaves the Euro zone, I could imaging that the Greek Euro coins will rise in value for coin collectors.
@_date: 2015-12-17 12:23:56
If it's their OWN, it's not open, not decentralized, not transparent ... and has nothing to do with the Bitcoin blockchain! It's more like blockpain ;D and just as successful as OS/2 and intranet.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:05:35
For me it sounds too conservative for the first years and too aggressive for the last years.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:07:16
Great post!
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:50:16
Because Bitcoin doesn't solve the problem in Greece. Most people don't have much money or the rest has already left the country. Crypto currencies are the future but not on monday when Greece leaves the Euro and finally reboots.
@_date: 2015-06-21 08:13:59
I'm talking about the banking business model.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:26:21
Europeans, too ;)
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:21:16
I guess it's wores because their complete business model collapses. Banks currently print money when you sign a loan but they can't print Bitcoins. With Bitcoins we get back to positive money/full-reserve banking and everyone who has a wallet is a Bitcoin bank.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:30:43

Is it possible to downgrade by loading the older version? Yesterday I've installed the wallet for the first time. I would like to show some non Bitcoin and Dogecoin users how great money 2.0 works.
@_date: 2014-09-11 10:31:19
Requires iOS 7.1 or later.
@_date: 2014-09-11 14:13:47
Not really :)
I just love my 3GS! It looks great, it's still working and I don't like the new look of iOS 7 ... but I want to use a wallet on my phone and the Blockchain.info wallet "supports" iOS 6.1.
Hopefully the bug gets solved in the next version.
@_date: 2014-09-11 10:30:51
Tell that Apple. Can't update my iPhone 3GS.
@_date: 2014-09-11 10:27:39
But it only supports iOS 7.0 or later.
@_date: 2015-05-31 20:01:03
First of all thank you very much for your great work!
But what about the miners, if they join bigger pools like GHash.io to preserve the profit rate? These days are tough for miners and electricity prices keep on rising. Don't rush into a hard fork while the debate is going on and keep Bitcoin decentralized.

Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2016-03-07 23:52:40
I'm not a coder, just a community member but the volunteer coder who keeps the project alive said the only thing that is blocking the decentralized exchange from working is this file with old code which needed to be ported from bitcore to bitcoinjs.

So true!
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:06:33
Great interview!
Peter Todd says 20 MB block size leads to Bitcoin centralization, because miners would earn less at small pools and would probably join GHash.io. So don't rush into a hardfork!
I'm supporting Peter Todd.
@_date: 2016-03-12 22:11:44
The porting is needed for alt coins because bitcore is Bitcoin only while bitcoinjs works with every coin.

Do you know if I need a licence in Ireland or the UK to sell Bitcoins as a business?
@_date: 2015-04-23 08:06:46


 I don't think so, because the Finance Minister of Greece doesn't like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-16 08:23:42
How about "bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic **gold**"?
@_date: 2015-04-09 13:12:17
I know, but in Germany you need a licence from BaFin for financial services to sell Bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:24:33
Sounds doable.
Thanks for all the info!
@_date: 2015-04-10 14:31:39
Sounds good!


If you read or hear about any licences for selling Bitcoins (as a business) in Ireland, please keep me updated!


In Switzerland they don't like two way ATMs either :)
@_date: 2015-04-10 14:06:24
Thank you very much for all this info!


Sounds great!


For the CEO or the registered office?


An initial registration fee of 110 GBP is really cheap.
So 210 GBP in total for the incorpoation as Limited, registering with HMRC as a Money Service Business and applying for the "fit and proper" test ... that's it?
@_date: 2015-09-08 15:49:49

What's the difference now between the UK and IoM?
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:26:04
Thank you for the links!


You're totally right, but how do I know what they have said about Bitcoin? I'm not on there mailing list ;)


Sure, but as a startup will I be able to pay for such licences?
For example in Germany I would need a licence for financial services for about 60,000 USD, plus an AML officer, plus AML software, etc.


How much time and money will this take approximately?


Hong Kong sounds good, too, but I have no clue how the incorporation works.
What do you think about Ireland and the Channel Islands?
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:28:06

@_date: 2015-10-14 19:18:14


If they create their own coin, no problem. If they try to take over Bitcoin, they have to start buying "some" miners and after that Andreas said "than we'll build just a new coin and switch the algo". Banks can't stop the technology, because today every 10 year old kid can create his own currency :)


Good idea but this sub is fine, too.
@_date: 2015-03-17 10:33:19
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-03-18 21:09:40
Thank you for explaining but I already know BitPay. My problem with MultiBit is that everytime I withdraw some Bitcoins the transaction fee is always different but BitPay wants the exact amount. What's your prefered desktop wallet?
@_date: 2015-03-25 11:51:16


I like MultiBit for PC/Mac and don't forget to lock and to backup your wallet.
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:38:52




I don't think so.
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:48:37
... or have to use, because many people will probably use it in the near future instead of fiat money :)

@_date: 2015-03-18 09:30:50
Just saw it yesterday and if you have only EUR like me, PayPal or Visa take always some "fees" by using a poor exchange rate.
In the past I had all my coins at Bitcoin exchanges and could withdraw the exact amount to pay with Bitcoins, but since I'm using Multibit only, I don't know how much I should withdraw to match the exact price in Bitcoin because of the unkown transaction fees. Any ideas? How do you pay with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-10-13 11:30:24

@_date: 2015-03-19 13:53:41
Today I've moved some Bitcoins with MultiBit and the fee is payed from the remaining Bitcoins of the wallet, not from the transfered amount, so the withdrawal gets transfered without any deduction ... next time I'll pay with Bitcoin :) 
Any plans to accept Dogecoin  through GoCoin? Second biggest crypto community, very fast transactions and very cheap fees :)
@_date: 2015-03-17 13:03:26
Which wallet did you use to pay?
Everytime I move Bitcoins or Dogecoins with MultiBit or MultiDoge, I have to calculate the fee within the amount I would like to withdraw and it's not always working.

They really think you can seperate Bitcoin from the blockchain. As long as they keep on thinking this way, the head start of Bitcoin gets even bigger and bigger. So probably crypto startups will replace banks in the near future.
