I tried like hell to buy at 485 but servers were overloaded. Would have been nice gain

I got banned and have alot of stuff pending. A bunch of others too apparently. All I have done recently was send to binance. Banned me 3 minutes after I sent to binance for 5th time in last 4 or so days.

Just closed mine too. Not sure why. Also have pending transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:28:29
Same here. Just got closure email 30 mins ago. I have pending transactions too.

I don't even know what to think anymore other than hodl
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:42:18
I'm not even sure why they closed it. I sent some funds to another exchange. Binance..maybe that's why. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:39:42
Yeah because it's cheaper and fees aren't as high right now. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:52:14
on coinbase they set the fee for you so kinda screwed there. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:53:03
I've been waiting for 3 and a half hours. so prob 16 or 17 blocks gone. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:53:28
they set the fee. In 24 hrs it comes back to you.

i used to think i was too smart for bitcoin, then I actually did some research on it and it's purpose/uses and I was sold and bought in. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 18:07:00
Seems like ppl are overreacting a little. I like how I'm downvoted for asking a question yet OP states their going under and isnt. Alot of circlejerking goes on this sub

I've deposited 3 times in the past 3 weeks to 5dimes. I wonder if i should be expecting an email soon. how long has it been for you? 
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:51:27
Yeah I just read some posts of people talking about their sketchy antics. I have 2k of pending orders right now with them. Wasn't planning on selling anytime soon though. But I'll have to fine another exchange too
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:31:32
That's what I've been doing. I'm a newbie bought first 3 wks ago. But just moved 2 days ago 
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:44:28
Coinbase is going under?

once i realized there was a limited supply of bitcoin and how much growth there is in terms of market cap, it seemed like it had tons of potential. BTC is like just over 10 billion USD. A company like Apple has a market cap of 500+ billion. Alot of room to grow. Will just have to hold off other cryptocurrencies as time goes on to keep value up.

If you have bitcoins with private key on a wallet that doesnt support bch, can you get bch from that if you input key on wallet that supports bch?
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:05:03
If this falls below 3600, that will push me over. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:19:20
Some people prob made a quick 10% 
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:10:44
Yes. Not updating my coins. Sent something there and noticed it was confirmed in blockchain but not in wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:51:22
Because its bitcoin.
