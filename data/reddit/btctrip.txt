Only that testimonial is a joke :) 
If that would be true he would fill his passport names for the booking and I don't believe he is willing to expose such information anywhere.

Sorry but that is internal information.

Don't worry, we didn't publish that info cause it depends on the requested airlines and seats availability. Just send us your request to business[at]btctrip.com and we will reply with the offer. The discount could be up to 10%!

It is in our agenda! EasyJet and a lot of low cost airlines of Europe and Asia. 
@_date: 2013-06-20 18:36:34
That depends of the searched flight type. Somes may take longer than others.

Thank you a lot! You have found a very rare bug that breaks the result page in any browser, generating the infinite wait, when the destination or origin name contain a single quote. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 19:31:30
You and the reddit bitcoin community can take advantage of the 10% discount in any flight ticket.

We will improve that information. Thank you!

We are not an scammer. It is the official reddit user of btctrip.com, to collect a feedback about the users and promoting offers.
@_date: 2013-06-20 19:46:04
Do you have that filter in the result page, it is the "Only Business" check box.
@_date: 2013-06-21 02:23:26
All right. As I couldn't read the deleted message, I thought your comment was for me.
@_date: 2013-06-23 17:57:36
Anybody of the reddit bitcoin community can apply for the discount by making a review post. Also can any blogger or site admin with a bitcoin related blog.
Help us to spread the word and make bitcoin mainstream!
