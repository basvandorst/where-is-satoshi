I have concluded to not give up on Bitcoin and Crypto Currency yet give into Banking, the people will always want, they arent responsible enough, they will pay extra for someone to handle and protect their currency. With that said I am taking my talents to Wells Fargo, JPM Chase or whomever is willing to hire me, to build a business from within.  Bitcoiners love being the bank, but we have to many people who cant live or understand life without a bank.

I recently attended a bitCoin panel at PayPal/eBay HQ and personally with the openness given to bitcoin and Bitcoin technologies I have no doubt it will be implemented as soon as the market is large enough to either get into or possibly for disruptive reasons which are good.

Well consider this, if there is an economic collapse of Zimbabwe proportions in whatever region you are at that currency will drop to next to nothing, toilet paper could be of more value than the whatever currency is affected.
You then look at the population at hand and see who has a tool for transaction it being BITCOIN which is at 13 million minted so far. 
Lets say there is 350 million citizens in your region and only 13 million btc to spread around....
In my view it is nothing more than a game changer but most importantly a pre-cursor to hat is to come. It might not be bitcoin, bitcoin is the hook but the real power is in control. Who has control

Unfortunately it starts of like this. The purchase and profit margins are are relatively low so they need to in order to cover costs and overhead. As the product spread it will become lower cost due to more sales. This is a growing pain that is a visual road block than actual one.

greatly, people are not into bitcoin because the technology is beyond them, yet if you attach an Apple insignia and all of a sudden the zombie masses will take the first step into implementation. 
They learn the payment processing basis of online transactions yet eventually they will have to learn the economics of bitcoin.
I for one welcome it, it is not a threat to bitcoin rather a very necessary tool to shape the network

Not much it was more of a meet and greet, it gave a quick informative intro as to what Bitcoin is and also start ups such as 37 coins which is a great service and Xapo which is paving the way for crypto currency debit cards.
If anything you get to meet many insiders at EBay and make a connection to educate/evangelize them to what crypto currency is and it's future and benefits to all.
There will be a more in depth panel and discussion tomorrow at Draper university the Bitcoin foundation will be there so will BitPay which is a phenomenal company and others at San Mateo Ca.

The best way to implement bitcoin is to start where money matters. At restauran5, recent got a job as a busses and have gained so much insight into how the market works and operates.  so give bits as extra tips to waiters and bussers.  
Being one I am definitely in support of it.

Robinhood provides the easiest platform for novice traders who are lazy in taxes.
@_date: 2016-07-31 20:24:45
what benefit may come of it? Is it worth investing in?
@_date: 2016-07-29 16:00:34
So it seems the coin base might be the new MtGox?

Going to watch UFC 200 with my friends and celebrate at the same time.
@_date: 2016-05-27 23:52:00
nice, dont lay all your eggs in one basket and remember what happened on the last halving. Who is the MTGox this time plus what economic situation is occurring. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 00:12:09
Awesome, thanks for doing this. Speaking with Joe will get you a very diverse crowd to spread the power of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 23:11:00
At this point it is best to being as compliant as you can be to operate within the system. 
@_date: 2016-07-30 22:04:23
No one expected let alone was prepared for MtGox, and no one seems to remember the rule if you dont hold it you dont own it.
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:05:09
Very true but works great for entry level traders

A Bitcoin Revenant per se?

Depends where you’re at and how you file taxes and what premiums you are willing to pay for.

Yet isn't all that stuff happening in Israel and Jewish communities? Division in Israel via ideologies, wealth and industries dominated by one group of ideas. It's all Fd up when too many people get together, like a hive per se.

Can you send me offline wallet please. I am having the worst time doing one 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:32:40
Suicide is not the answer. The most important intrinsic value is the one that we place ourselves: mine are always my life, my family and monetary notions. If I loose the first 2 all else won't matter so again it is only money not life or influence which is what moves the world. Stay strong everybody and enjoy the holidays.
Also maybe go to the gym and work extra hard until you forget the monetary losses for you will achieve physical gain and quite possibly inner peace. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:11:00
That is too much. It should be at a fixed price point of 99 used or the worldwide equivalent of such amount. I will be more inclined to spend ,25 BTC than 1 whole BTC
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:43:14
Will redo once I get to my keyboard.

Dream big my friend. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 06:29:43
Recently my bank chase froze my ATM due to suspicion of fraud. I am currently left with a balance of about $1500 because CoinBase withdraws money faster than it deposits it. 
I honestly think I am fucked, I talked to the banker and I got the same dog and pony show as always. 
Did anybody know that Chase hires a third party protection agency which does not allow them to inform the consumer what we are actually being protected from. 
I love BitCoin but CoinBase is killing my experience and faith in them. 
And yes I have sent multiple e-mails and support questions. To think I looked up to CoinBase but now it feels like if they are the same old bank servicers in the modern Digital Currency market.

Entrepreneurs and the businesses they create/innovate using digital currency
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:00:12
Touché, I will do the same.
Mistake was made.

I sold 8 to repurchase 7.5 I fd up royally but I expect them having a delayed reaction to yesterday's occurrence.
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:35:12
No Banks, escrow and intermediaries yes. banks are what got us into this mess to begin with. Why would a BTC user give away his right and powers of being their own bank?
@_date: 2013-10-23 02:35:24
I'm so happy to see the CoinBase ap on iOs!
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:52:43
Ditto my friend. Outstanding response and perception. Thank You.
@_date: 2013-08-31 21:19:46

Where do you buy LTC from?
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:16:31
will it be to expensive when it reaches 1000?
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:14:39
Nasim Talib said it best: In order for BitCoin to succeed It will need a major detractor. China fits that mold, this is BitCoins most important battle
@_date: 2013-12-17 09:54:32
Still is, China will loose willingly.
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:08:48
Locking you out of depositing into armory?
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:37:53
Can I use and install armory via my windows 8 pc. serious question
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:50:07
20 years of implementation will stabilize via a rise until it reaches its fair point, considering that lost BTC will be added to the exchange 
@_date: 2013-11-17 02:07:43
the fact that their product and service earn currency regalrdles of form. There business is making money not buyng/investing
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:02:24
Good for you man, I lost at least 3 BC and they did nothing about it. It's selective I guess.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:21:26
Dont fall for it! Its just Black Friday vendors cashing out.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:01:57
Isn't taxes part of the problem too?
@_date: 2013-10-27 02:26:10
At this point I will say Chase
@_date: 2013-10-19 05:36:30
Simplify it more please.
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:24:17
The way I see it is as: In order to secure worldwide attention and acclaim BitCoin needs to confront major national turbulence. China falls in the parameter as the first competition BitCoin faces. China is a tremendous force in the world stage and this should be interesting. If I was a betting man I will wager on BitCoin prevailing. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:50:00
I only have one question for you. Where do you see it 3 years from now?
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:26:29
WTF IS REAGAN doing in this image. He is one if not the most important figure in government expansion/growth/expense he is what BitCoin stands against!
BullShit on Reagan!
@_date: 2013-10-26 06:24:20
As a landlord and BitCoin supporter I will have to ask you the tenant to cash in your BC and pay the rent. I dont have time to cash in a commodity. Selling him in the future potential is one thing accepting the future now is the main thing.

Buy via CoinBase transfer to BTC-E.
Purchase Altcoins with BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:56:52
I have used block chain and CoinBase but I can't figure out how to do an offline wallet create something like a Trezor! Can you do something similar to that? I don't know how to make an offline wallet
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:00:00
Soon enough everyone would whore themselves out for BitCoin.
