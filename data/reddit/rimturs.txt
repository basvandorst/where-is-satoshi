But bitcoin.org is only about bitcoin but bitcoin.com is about both, so? Bitcoin.com has cloudmining for both btc and bch. Their mining pool handles both. Their wallet takes both. Their news is about both. Why would someone list them anyway else?
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:27:19
Can't you just do it yourself though, using the keys?
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:22:03
Not the same wallet but the same keys so the funds shouldn't be lost if you know your keys. BCH sent to a segwit address would be a problem though.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:14:14
The keys are the same so even if the wallet doesn't recognize it (wallet is only looking for bch), the btc  should still be there.

Yeah, and I am CEO of Bitcoin Core. There.
It is a joke title.

Those are only concerns for now though, right? When/if it really takes off 1 isn't possible and 2 isn't needed. But I have not really dug too deep into IOTA yet, so I can be totally wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:15:49
If you put Bitcoin in the BCH address you still get the bitcoin as the wallet creates both wallets at the same time.

CEO is joke title. There are no real CEOs in Bitcoin. Roger Ver thinks BCH is Bitcoin because it is closer to the white paper.

Well, the nordic don't have socialism in the same vein as Venezuela either. Other than the high taxes we have a (relatively) free economy.

Isn't that better fixed with more actors rather than regulation in the code? If there is money there will be competition which will be better for everybody in the long run.

Well, then I have to agree with those you call "libertards" as we do have problems about those things. Obviously not hell on earth but there certainly are issues.
Our pension is really a dice gamble decided by our government as the money isn't earmarked and we do have really long waiting times for healthcare and so forth. 
But economically (apart from the high taxes) our governments have a pretty hands off approach. If Sweden would be as hands on as Venezuela regarding price fixing and regulations we would be in the same boat. So socialism wouldn't work here either.

You don't Think that group of developers would be larger post hard fork?

Makes sense. That is kind of the bitcoin equivalent to border walls and protectionism while hard forking for no limit block sizes is the free market stance. ;)

Disclaimer: I do not know enough to have a properly informed opinion, these are only thoughts.
Email scale spam would only be a thing with zero transaction fee though, right?
If there were a way to give fees to nodes centralization would be fixed. I know there is no way to know there are real full nodes as of now but is that really harder to implement than side chain solutions? That seems like the obviuos solution to me. No tap on blocksize and fees for full nodes. It seems wrong to have important infrastructure without financial benifits.

Though that is so far off that it just might.
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:57:29
I guess those holders will read up on it as BCH surges though. And the majority of people holding in cold storage are probably waiting out the storm, hedging their bets with both of them. So marketcap is the same. I mean, even if BCH takes over and becomes the defacto BTC, every random schmuck with a paperwallet, or on everything on an Exchange, won't know the difference when they finally withdraw to a hot wallet (that by then runs what is now BCH).
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:04:41
Really? $1 is 13719 satoshis.
We have mBTC, µBTC and Satoshi. Right now mBTC would be easiest to use as 1 mBTC is about $7. If one bitcoin were to be $100000 we could use µBTC (1µBTC would then be $0,1).
Maybe it is a US not using metrics thing that gets some people confused on what milli and micro means.
Kilo, Mega, Giga etc doesn't seem to be a problem though, so I don't know.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:17:55
Which would be bad if it were true. I agree on that. But you know, it isn't. Instead of testing the app the writer apparently choses to quote random redditusers. I don't even... This has been really weird to witness.
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:55:41
I don't understand what you mean? MegaCoins? Would that be 1000000 bitcoins.? And why change name from Satoshi to Coinlet?
The thing with milliBitcoin and microBitcoin is that those are part of the international system of units.

Actually it says "BCH wallets are created by default" which is quite different. I totally agree on that the wording of the added feature list isn't ideal. Anyway, I downloaded it and it defaults to both BTC and BCH, so that is that. Nothing to deny.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:56:12
I just installed it. You get two separate wallets that are clearly labeled. The controversy is pretty unfounded. I am looking for a way to swipe a paper wallet, havent found it though. It would be super useful if it separated them automatically.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:15:44
And this is why I think it would be good to list price as mBTC. You can absolutely buy in fractions. 1 milli (1/1000) bitcoin is $9.7
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:50:40
But it doesn't. It defaults to BTC and BCH and both wallets are clearly labelled and if you still manages to get it wrong the coins land in their right spots anyway. I don't see the controversy.
Actually, this wallet should be particularly good for separating and selling your prefork BCH (if you don't want them because scam, btrash or whatever).
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:28:25
Exactly, the world isn't the US where bandwitdth caps is even a thing.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:17:28
If you have held bitcoin since before the fork you have btc and bch at that address. This wallet works with both.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:47:38
Oh, missed the others. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:19:02
This reasoning halts in that even if you are allowed to give up your liberty you are not allowed to give up anyone else's.

What are you arguing against? Not libertarianism anyway. And probably not this Ver-Land either.
Of course there would be enforcement. There would be cops. Laws. A strong constitution. In the long haul there would be people arguing for less personal freedom in return for more collective safety. The debate between personal freedom and collective safety is eternal. In the long haul though, personal freedom is winning.

*edited for clarification*
Well, I don't agree. This is one of the things that is revolutionary when you compare it to fiat. It isn't just a decentralized payment system but a decentralized currency in the way it works too. It isn't a hijack attempt, that is recent fud.
Forks was always intended in the initial development and has only become controversial in the recent years. It was one of the things that sold it to me. No one can take over bitcoin and there can never be a central bank controlling the code as the market choses which version to use.
Had it forked in those early days this kind of fear wouldn't be taken seriously now. A successful fork would make bitcoin stronger as it would prove it can survive that. If it can't survive a fork, it is too weak to exist with forking as a possibility in which case it would have been good to do it earlier anyway.
**"There is no way such a system would get adopted, it is a stupid system."**
Well it is being adopted anyway and a lot of people seems to think it isn't an especially stupid system. Forking is a possibility (even if you are scared of it) and is undeniably a part of bitcoin. You can't change that. That is the system and we have to deal with it.
If it really is a weakness it would be better to expose it sooner rather than later as it will always be a possibility. Why wouldn't you want weakness exposed? You should shine a light on it so it can be fixed, closing your eyes and hoping for the best is what causes finacial crises. And if forking is a possibillity, given enough time, it will happen.
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:01:47
Definitly used Photoshop, so I don't think that is true.
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:08:27
Forking is how BTC is supposed to evolve and to ensure that we have the best version and that it won't be hijacked by a development team. I understand not liking specific details about a fork but not being against the concept itself. Forking into competing versions from competing teams is one of the most important concepts of btc.
I think we would've been better off if there had been a successful fork that had taken over btc a long time ago. Reason why isn't even that important. Just to free btc from all this fear.
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:09:38
It wouldn't have been perceived as such a big deal if the drop was from $4.9 to $4.5. But that is what happened to the mBTC. If that drop is scary, maybe you've bought too many mBTC.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:42:50
Nah, I did it. He found it here. :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:27:47
There were so much FUD going on about forking before BCH even though it is such a crucial concept for Bitcoin. For that reason alone we need forks, else we will have centralized development that cannot be challanged because of fear.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:28:48
Fewer bitcoin was my point. We will make lots of more trillions, and a huge chunk of it due to economic growth, not inflation.
Look at my link and my code. $5000/mBTC in 2140 is no less likely than $84/mBTC next year. Unlikely, but not impossible. And that is without counting lost coins and that annual gwp growth stays stagnant (both more unlikely than $5000/mBTC).
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:41:51
You don't take account that there is economic growth. About 3.6% right now (but will likely grow as development countries starts to rise).
So I ran this:
    gwp=75;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 123; i++) {gwp=gwp*1.036;}
    document.write(gwp);
So 105 trillion would be 1.8% of GWP by 2140. And there will not be 21 million coins either.
1mBTC would be $84 if btc marketcap were 1.8% of gwp today, so.
