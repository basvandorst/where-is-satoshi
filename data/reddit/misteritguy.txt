I dumped it all after he lost his cool over calling Bitcoin Cash BCash.

Yes and no. Litecoin has some other technology that makes it better.

Is it just me, or does the commercial with girls dancing and the chairs sound like the theme music to tetris?
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:41:36
When I click on the segwit branch, will I see my bitcoins that sit on the legacy branch? If not, how would I go about moving them to the new segwit branch within the ledger?
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:08:51
I second this. Talk about misleading new comers to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:41:21
I thought the guy who wrote it was joking at first. Sad that he really believes the crap he is saying. I would much rather put 10K into a "fake coin" then buy a jetski that will be worth a lot less then 10K in a year.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:54:44
I found that funny too.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:16:46
Brought another 500 dollars worth at 3750. Will buy more if it drops more.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:56:35
My gut feeling is that after the Oct. 18th election in China, the exchanges will reopen with "new" regulations and oversite. 
If China was really against cryptocurrencies, then why are they still ok with mining and OTC?
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:04:35
I believe that is what Remitano is. Looks like you can buy at a major mark up now, but not sell?

Mass Adoption?!? Correct me if I am wrong but isn't bitcoin used by maybe .5 to 1% of the world population?
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:59:40
They are banning the exchanges. BTCC i shutting down on Sept. 30th and Charlie Lee mentioned that OKCoin and Huobi have a meeting with the government later today in china.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:24:38
These bankers what to have the price drop so their hedge fund friends can buy in cheap.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:14:30
You know what the number one thing that is used for illegal activities..... the US dollar.
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:33:47
All of these articles are just speculation. Nothing is for certain until we here from PBoC or the Chinese government.
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:31:09
It is 9:30 am in China.
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:20:51

@_date: 2017-09-11 16:37:45
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:30:53
I am waiting a little bit longer. Want to see if the other exchanges in china say they are closing too. Also, the west coast has not seen the news yet so they will panic sell more then likely.
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:15:33
But I love the bitcoin coster guy. ha ha

I have all of mine on a Ledger Nano S. It has been great.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:20:32
This video got me started in the right direction.
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:43:58
I don't see them banning it either. This is why I just want them to tell us that they are ok with it and we can all go back to watching Bitcoin rise.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:11:35
I really think this whole thing is a manipulation. The current president wants to get reelected and what is an easy way to get your communist friends on board, crack down on cryptocurrencies. But, the president is actually a big fan so he doesn't want the mining to stop. That would stop the money from coming in. Banning the exchanges is a bigger news deal and doesn't stop the coins from being produced in China. Also, they can buy up cheap coins and then reopen the exchanges in a month and watch the price boom.
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:58:16
Can we stop posting these articles? Until someone from PBoC or the Chinese government comes out and says if they are banning crypto or not, this is all just causing FUD.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:15:53
Look at past Bitcoin history. This is nothing new and always happens before it hits ATH. I know it is scary but if you hang on for the long term, it will go back up. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:43:27
Yep, waiting for the other two exchanges to say something. Then it will bottom out and I will buy a bunch as it goes back up.
I wouldn't be surprised if at the end of the month, they open back up under new regulations.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:15:36
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:56:06
True, which is a shame for them when we all buy up their cheap coins.
@_date: 2017-09-11 07:27:33
"According to a report by the Bloomberg"
This line tells me everything I need to know.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:13:44
I am waiting for them to get up.
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:16:39
I will be buying the China dip.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:13:46
And then it will sky rocket at the end of October when Chinese un-banneds the exchanges again.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:32:56
Yeah, it is sad. This is why I buy and HODL.
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:42:23
Not sure if it is the cheapest, but in the US, it is the only one I know that allows CC.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:15:36

I can totally see this. Right after the election in Oct 18.

I would take 25% of my pay in bitcoin. I am in IT.
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:28:39
As much as I would love to buy 1500 btc, I don't see that happening because the WSJ article is FUD.
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:30:09
Someone needs to make a "Banned In China" T-Shirt.
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:19:54
Well, we will see. If she does get fired for this and/or the news is real, I will be shocked and will be the first one to admit I was wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:32:13
It totally is! This Chine BS is really fucking things up. I hope they ban bitcoin in china. Then they can't fuck with the market anymore.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:24:37
I agree, if they are going to ban it, just come out and say it. Unless China knows the rumors are worse and figured why say anything.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:59:51
Oh god! I bought at 3200 and 3000. Who sold at 3000?!
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:52:22
I bought a little bit at 3500, but I don't think this is over yet. I brought some though, just in case I am wrong.
EDIT: Spelling :-)
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:11:05
"The ban will only apply to trading of cryptocurrencies on exchanges, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the information is private"
This is the same "news" that has been going around since the early hours of this morning. Until something official comes from PBoC or the Chinese government, this is all just speculation. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:25:18
She will keep her job when this comes out as FUD. It is all about being the first one out of the gate today. No one has time to fact check which is why media is so inaccurate.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:43:31
You are good. You get locked in when you click buy.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:51:41
Well, if it isn't, I will just buy more. It will rebound at some point and help my dollar cost average.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:58:37
This is just the Bitcoin Labor Day Sale!!
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:44:30
Nothing is official until PBoC or the Chinese government says it is. Until then, it is still speculation.
I am hoping something official comes out soon, good or bad, so we can all move on.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:21:37
Not isn't a problem. 3300 is some cheap Bitcoin. I had/have my buy limits at 3200, which was filled, and 2900 right now.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:15:19
I know of these guys.
I know there are others working on it too.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:04:31
I know the feeling. I have 1K coming into GDAX on Friday. I ended up just buying the dip on coinbase to lock in the low price.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:11:56
Don't buy a bunch. My small amounts, like 100 dollars or something as it moves down. That way, if it tanks, you have a much better dollar cost average. No one can honestly time the market.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:08:02
Nope, I definitely see it going under 3K now. Currently at 3244 on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:25:54
I sure as hell did!
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:59:56
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:54:50
Yep, which is why OKCoin and Houbi will not close. They will magically get a license and stay open. I wouldn't be surprised if BTCC reopens trading in Nov.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:59:40
They are banning the exchanges. BTCC i shutting down on Sept. 30th and Charlie Lee mentioned that OKCoin and Huobi have a meeting with the government later today in china.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:20:10
It is about to bottom out. Definitely don't sell now.
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:36:37
It is true. I hope it passes.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:15:33
I am with you. If they are going to FUD the hell out of Bitcoin like this, let them do it now and we can buy up all the coins. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:27:39
I have total faith in the investment. I brought a bunch at 4700 and did not sell it because I know it will come back and then some.
I just want all the FUD to come out and the weak people to sell so I can buy even more and laugh at them as the price jumps back up.
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:25:24
The thing I hate is every time I tell someone about Bitcoin or crypto in general, the first thing out of their mouth is, "Your going to loose all of your money!" 
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:55:48
I would love for this to happen, but no way.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:45:25
I agree with you. I think it will hit 3000 and then go back up. I am going to buy a ton when it hits that because at 3K, bitcoin is a steal.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:08:02
Nope, I definitely see it going under 3K now. Currently at 3244 on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:33:18
I believe it will go that low or possibly even lower. Look at the 100 Day average price. That is sitting around 3200. 
Also, if you look back at the last big dip, the market lost over 30 percent of it's value. We aren't at 30% yet.
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:51:20
Please do a search before posting stuff like this. This FUD has been posted so many time now.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:32:13
It totally is! This Chine BS is really fucking things up. I hope they ban bitcoin in china. Then they can't fuck with the market anymore.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:02:54
I am thinking 3000 to 2800. I have buy orders at 3000, 2900 and 2800.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:44:42
Me too, I just keep buying the dips.
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:59:36
Coinbase is the only one I know of in the US. It costs about 40 bucks to buy 1000 dollars in bitcoin with a credit card.
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:24:39
This is what I am doing.
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:13:31
"The financial regulator has issued a stern warning against a speculative frenzy over initial coin offerings (ICOs) in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin"
The first sentence tells me everything. Bitcoin is not an ICO. Do these people even do research?
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:48:04
No one can tell for sure. Some are saying 3300 and some are saying 3000. The way it is dropping now, I can see it hitting these two targets but nothing is certain.
What I do is by a little bit as it goes down. That way, if rebounds, you got in at the bottom and if it keeps going down, you end up with a better dollar cost average as you buy more. 
In the end, this has happened so many times. It will go back up to where it was, it will just take time.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:44:28

@_date: 2017-09-14 18:51:07
Who knows, maybe that will happen in October.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:18:41
I am with you. At this point, I am waiting for some news. I brought some last night when the price was 3950. Woke up this morning to 3850.
I am waiting for news, either good or bad, before I buy more. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 07:37:17
It is fake news. The WSJ put out a BS article with zero facts that China banned Bitcoin and then Bloomberg reposted it basically. Then this place wrote a BS article off the Bloomberg BS. 
Just look at the Chinese exchanges. If there was a ban, why would the all be in the green right now?
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:42:55
I agree. Just buy small amounts, like 100 or 200, when it settles in each dip. That way, if it dips lower, you can throw some more in. If it stops going down and starts to go up, you at least put some money in at the bottom.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:10:31
I can definitely see that happening.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:21:36
Being Charlie Lee was correct about BTChina, I am waiting to hear from OKCoin and Huobi tomorrow. If they say they are shutting down on Sept. 30th, it will drop again.
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:57:54
I hate the banks. I can't wait for crypto to be wide spread so I can get rid of my bank.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:21:18
I can see 3200 to 3000 before it flips and goes back up.
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:11:07
Yeah, I replied before the Charlie Lee tweeted this afternoon. I definitely see it going below 3000 now.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:51:07
Who knows, maybe that will happen in October.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:41:10
I do! Everyone was mad at him but he was right after all. I am waiting for the other two exchanges to say when they are closing.
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:22:26
Definitely HODL! Even if it is true, which I feel it isn't, they are a very small part of the overall Bitcoin market at this point. It may drop some, but it will come back. This isn't the first time China has done this and it always comes back and then some.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:36:29
I can totally see this. Right after the election in Oct 18.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:20:10
It is about to bottom out. Definitely don't sell now.
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:41:19
They have there own apps in the chrome app store, which is what I use.
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:30:50
When I read this, all I hear is this.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:54:53
If you look at bitcoin over the past few years, drops like this have happened and then it hits ATH. I know how you feel, but as long as you HODL and not sell when it dips, you will be ok in the long run.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:27:26
Charlie Lee tweeted that BTC exchanges in China are being banned.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:35:46
I brought 2K worth around this price on Sunday morning. I am waiting to see if it goes lower before I pay the CoinBase CC fees.
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:31:09

I had an order in at 3500, then sold it at 3350 because of the Charlie Lee tweet. Glad I did being we are at 3240 on GDAX now.

I bought a little bit at 3500, but I don't think this is over yet. I brought some though, just in case I am wrong.

Ha ha ha, damn straight.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:54:42
100%! This is a bitcoin sale in my book. Bitcoin cannot be stopped, definitely not at this point. Once the decentralized exchanges come online in the next couple months, bitcoin will hit 5K and beyond.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:21:36
Being Charlie Lee was correct about BTChina, I am waiting to hear from OKCoin and Huobi tomorrow. If they say they are shutting down on Sept. 30th, it will drop again.

@_date: 2017-09-14 15:59:09
At least one news outlet gets it. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:43:00
He mentioned he brought a trezor and is waiting for it to come in.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:02:14
Yep, it is called shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:06:04
Not yet, wait until after more people in the US get up and sell. My buy is at 2900
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:11:35

@_date: 2017-09-14 12:49:51
Banning Bitcoin is basically not possible at this point. That is why they are banning the exchanges. They can control them.
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:40:26
I agree! They need to tell us what is really going on so we can move on from this already.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:54:50
Yep, which is why OKCoin and Houbi will not close. They will magically get a license and stay open. I wouldn't be surprised if BTCC reopens trading in Nov.

@_date: 2017-09-13 16:17:57
Don't feel bad. I brought some around that price too. Just HODL and wait out the storm or better yet, buy more when it hits bottom.
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:22:58
I would love to know why everyone is getting out all of a sudden. I though last night when it dipped to 3950 was the end and brought more Bitcoin. 
I guess I will just buy more when this dip ends.
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:42:34
I should try this.
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:36:18
If I didn't already have a bank transfer in place to GDAX, I would have probably brought some with my checking account on CoinBase.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:18:37
It would go down more if they banned mining. Don't see that happening though.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:13:46
And then it will sky rocket at the end of October when Chinese un-banneds the exchanges again.

The sub would be filled with that dumb poking Bitcoin with a stick meme.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:22:41
Best thing I have read all morning. I hope the noobs read this and realize that all the FUD is ridiculous and means nothing. If not, we will all just buy their coins.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:20:54
I does suck, but this is the world of cryptocurrencies at the moment. More governments will come on board over time. I honestly think they don't have a choice in the long run.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:13:34
3500 is a good place to start. If it drops lower, then do it the next time it flattens out like it is now.
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:02:33
At this point, I hope he is right so we can move on from this.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:39:33
I brought a bunch at a much higher price. Buying at the bottom so my dollar cost average is a lot better.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:23:02
I second this!
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:52:32
Classy RatioEssendi.... Real Classy.
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:11:07
Yeah, I replied before the Charlie Lee tweeted this afternoon. I definitely see it going below 3000 now.
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:28:24
Never put in more then you are willing to loose. Bitcoin could go to a million or crash to a dollar. 
IMHO, I am thinking it is more likely to go up over time then down.
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:56:35
My gut feeling is that after the Oct. 18th election in China, the exchanges will reopen with "new" regulations and oversite. 
If China was really against cryptocurrencies, then why are they still ok with mining and OTC?
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:02:23

@_date: 2017-09-13 15:10:09
I keep buying small amounts when each drop stabilizes. If it drops more, I will buy more. If it goes up, I brought the lowest dip.
That being said, I could see it going to 3200 before it bounces back, but no one really knows.
