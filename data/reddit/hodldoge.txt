�� I love this in the banking system only those with friends who own guns can �� BTC isn’t a discriminator unlike those in the  fiat system that is true. But I cannot be a whale unless I have sh*t tons of money like those on the fiat system. I’m sure many who manipulate the BTC who are whales are most likely friends with ppl who own guns

I can’t argue against that. Owning your own money and having deflationary currency is a valid point. I didn’t quite think of that. Plus lazy people and homeless ppl isn’t a choice. Well at least not for me. I’ve sold what valuables I can and tried finding what odd jobs i can and gathered half of what I need to cover things financially, if I’m not able to pay rent end of month which I hope I will cuz I’m still looking for ways to try to figure this all out then yeah I would be homeless but not because I chose it. I would be homeless because my job fired me for being disabled instead of providing accommodation as I requested per ADA law and let me go without reason after I asked if there was any progress on finding an accommodation. I would be homeless because I’m not a materialist and buying lots of  junk so selling a 32” tv, DVD player and a suitcase record player with 5 vinyl albums sadly isn’t enough to cover what I need �� so maybe that part is my fault if I wasted my life buying junk I prob could had more to sell ��. I’ll be homeless because there isn’t as much ppl who are kind of charitable anymore. 
I’ve done everything on my end and done what I could to cover what I can myself. I’m just stuck. Not like I want to be homeless or plan on it as a awesome goal to have.

What do I need to explain?

Some thoughtful deep sh*t there. I didn’t see it like that. But I guess I see your point.

That is not what I am suggesting. The world works by people producing and contributing to society. I’m not promoting a free hand outs or expect ppl not to contribute as it doesn’t work this way.
I’ll use my case for example. I’m considered legally disabled. But I’m simply just hearing impaired and I wear hearing aids that’s all and nothing else and I can hear and communicate fine with hearing aids. I’ve been working since 16 years old and worked across retail/fast food and eventually worked as a Adult Mentor or individuals with developmental disabilities and my last job was working for a temp agency call center doing tech support.
Due to being “legally” disabled I qualify or am eligible for food stamps, housing, SSI and whatever benefits disabled ppl can sign up for. Since 16 and since I’ve worked I have never signed up for any of those. Mostly because I’ve seen my biological family and their friends on govt assistance and it creates a system of dependence.
My birth mom wouldn’t let me stay at her apt a few years ago when my apt was condemned and the landlord took off. I had a job, offered to pay the full rent as it was only $650 and she said oh I can’t do that. If housing comes by and see you living here I could lose my section 8. ��‍♂️
You can’t but what you want to eat with food stamps and only whatever is approved. It creates a dependency on the government that only gives you enough to barely get by. Ive made more money a month working than I would if I applied for government benefits.
But that’s just me. I know other ppl who have govt benefits and also stand on corners or walk around Walmart parking lot asking everyone for money.  I’m not saying we develop a system that Caters to those kind of people because that’s also a unjust financial system where money is being taxed from those working to fund those who don’t want to.
It’s not that I don’t want to work, it’s not that I’m asking for free hand outs. I have work lined up and schooling lined up in August going forward. I have goals and priorities in place to enhance my marketable skills and education to further my career.  It’s a matter of being stuck in a rough spot and asking for a hand up through July. I think there should be a system where people like that can get the one time help they need. I have some money to cover half my bills and not like I was asking for all of my bills to be covered.

If you’re not a fan of Dragon Ball Z then you are not a fan of Bitcoin and over 9k is well...you’ll never get it. Living a sad pitiful life. �� cheers each to their own. But it’s not spam. Spam is a processed meat in a can.

Believe me I’ve been getting plenty of offers to join Ponzi schemes and the likes. With my situation if I can invest $100 of BTC for $300 return it sounds good but I know I’ll end up with $100 less to pay bills. ��

I’m down for all that. Censorship resistant. Trust less, permission-less. But do you honestly think BTC will thrive in a world controlled by people who are elites and manipulating people, money, economies. You can’t keep tabs on people when you don’t know who’s who on BTC blockchain, you can’t tax Bitcoin if there’s no way to track the flow of money in and out of your wallet. 
Tin foil hat time. Whether or not there is a group of ppl that is believed to be the in the shadows made up of elites. What do you think will thrive under them? Libra Coin by Facebook where info can be gathered and tabs can be kept and control is kept on a tight leash? Or Bitcoin where anonymity and freedom makes it impossible to manipulate or control or gather info or keep tabs on people. 
Mark my words Bitcoin will be outlawed and those of us holding it will be outlaws. If such a shadow society exists then I would imagine something like Libra coin or JPcoin something similar to it that can be controlled and ppl can be controlled. I hope I’m wrong.

Wasn’t aware it existed. No I’ve had a rough day yesterday and allowed my feelings to cloud my thoughts and judgements. I’m just tired of ppl assuming the worst of me yet I don’t blame em. I blame the people who have no morals and go about scamming people to where honest pleas for help like mine gets tossed in with their crap. I like to think of it as BSV and BTC. It’s like a Business saying they won’t accept Bitcoin because BSV is bad and tossing Bitcoin in the same group since BSV has been poorly representing why Crypto is important. Yet it wouldn’t be fair to toss BTC into a group as a bad currency just because BSV has been mucking up and representing crypto all wrong. Scammers are BSV, I’m BTC �� piss poor analogy but it’s the only one I got.

Fiat as in dollars and you’re talking about a car �� I’ve been proven wrong in the most hilarious way possible.

Will we even pass $10k I’m highly doubting it. But we can only see

Thanks for taking the time to educate and point out to me that the evil Bitcoin is fighting is against those people with the power over the rules and supply of money. That really helps me understand a little bit more about Bitcoin better. Now that you mentioned that I’m okay with that. It makes sense.
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:28:50
Yeah it was written from a emotional standpoint. However if Bitcoin is the standard I was saying it being controlled/manipulated  by whales in the sense of the price is volatile because sat Someone buys a $100mil worth of Bitcoins then dumps it and the price falls and then buys up another $100mil worth of Bitcoins at the lower price then it gets high again then dumps it.
then ppl like myself are buying fractions of a bitcoin when it’s $7000, $9000, $8,000 $9,000 etc since the price is always volatile due to whales dumping ppl like myself and well most ppl for that matter gets the short end of the stick.
Do you own gold? I don’t. But most of the gold locked up by countries and possessed by the Rich. The same ppl who control the money supply are the same ppl buying up Bitcoin. Since Gold isn’t used in day to day purchases neither will Bitcoin. The Wealthy elites will be sitting in 100,000-200,000 Bitcoins and countries that are smart like Russia/China buying up Bitcoins will sit on it and with 21 million BTC not everyone is gonna be owning one bitcoin.

Anger aside, and looking at it objectively and truthfully yeah Bitcoin has a better value that has beneficial traits.
