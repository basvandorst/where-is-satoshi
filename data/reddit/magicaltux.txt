We prove the document "proving" transaction malleability only affected 350BTC to be wrong.
Still, we only mentioned transaction malleability as a potential factor, never ever said it was the only MO.

Exploiting the bug to perform an attack is actually perfectly possible for any mining pool with enough hashing power, and as of Feb 2014 we saw reports of this attack being actually used against other targets.
The fact this kind of attack is possible is an issue in itself. Transaction hashes are commonly used for tracking transactions, and it should not be possible for a third party to alter someone's transaction. This problem could affect anyone.

I believe creditors can access the elements we provided through the court. The point was not to get an exact figure on transaction malleability, but rather to prove that the specific document was wrong (someone submitted to the court), so we just had to show transaction malleability affecting more than 350 BTC (a quick search led us to find a 1000 BTC event if I remember this correctly).
Also, as of Feb 10, 2014, we only knew of transaction malleability through someone showing this could actually be exploited (publicly). We disabled bitcoin withdrawals, started searching for a solution (reached normalized txid), and at the same time re-checked all cold wallets. By the end of Feb. we found out that it was unlikely we had enough BTC (we did find some later, however) so we contacted the court and proceeded with civil rehabilitation from there.
I still believe normalized txid should be a thing, as it's the only way to keep track of whatever you sign and push on the network. There are efforts to make transactions immutable, but there is no guarantee there won't be a way to overcome that in the future.

Just to confirm, your analysis was based on transactions seen on the network, but then becoming invalid because an exact same transaction (same in/out, signature modified) was found in a later block?
The problem is that at the time we implemented MtGox's transaction system (bitcoin 0.3), there was no requirement on signatures - and we used Bitcoin 0.3's implementation (crypto++, see  - was also adding padding for values that could be interpreted as negative as per bitcoin sourcecode). Bitcoin around 0.6 or 0.8 started to refuse relaying transactions which had an invalid signature (either because of padding added by bitcoind 0.3, or because the signature was not in the expected range which bitcoin started enforcing) but those are still valid in blocks (because the signature is valid).
Which means an attacker could simply take the pending_tx list from MtGox, find his transaction there, modify it and broadcast it. The network would only see his tx, and once mined by someone (anyone) MtGox would find our own tx to have invalid inputs and will attempt to fix it.
The network would never see MtGox's initial transaction (since it doesn't get relayed) and I'm afraid you wouldn't either, unless you specifically monitored our pending_tx list.

Let me just say that we had lawyers, and was as far as we know in compliance with Japanese laws contrary to the allegations made in this book.
Prof. Lenz could have contacted me (or at least contacted a Japanese lawyer) before publishing to clarify a few points, but didn't.

Unlikely. We had the US govt contact us once about a EU customer who did a wire from his bank in EU to Japan and they had a copy of the wire info. I guess disclosing data to a foreign govt or law enforcement is usually not seen as a breach of privacy laws in the world of finance.

Tibanne has always been (since its beginning) doing hosting services, and was the very first Bitcoin-accepting hosting company in the world (back in 2010).

Actually you're quite lucky in France, since opening a bank account is a basic right available to all citizens and companies.
If all banks deny you access to banking, you can contact the Banque de France to ask for "droit au compte" (right to an account). They'll decide on a bank and will provide paperwork that will require said bank to open a bank account for you (plus in that case the bank can't charge you fees and has a lot of obligations - many banks will accept opening a regular account for you if you put them in front of that paper).
Actually we did use this method to keep a bank account in France at some point. We did end closing, however, when the regulator told us they don't care about what the laws says, but will squish anything that goes against banks' monopoly ("violation du monopole bancaire"). We did have some kind of lawsuits involving banks and the French regulator, but it mostly died down when we moved EUR activity to Poland.

I am not sure how this would be squeezing smaller miners out. There are two things I can think of: producing big blocks requires more memory/bandwidth (smaller miners can elect not to if they want, there is no penalty for producing small blocks) and receiving big blocks require more bandwidth (there were talks about this on how to allow block propagation to work with the block header alone - or at least not the whole block with all txs bodies - and as such be much faster).
Was there anything else?
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:55:35
Concept is interesting but puts some trust in the payment channel intermediate (party D+ needs to trust party B). Because those txs are locked in time, parties A and B could cooperate to spend coins to a different target even after confirming a transaction.
There is however basically no risk for the buyer (except having coins blocked until the locktime is reached).
TR2 could be generated by the channel server, which would avoid validation pitfalls for implementation of the channel server.
This however opens an interesting feature where any party D+ could refund payment since customer's return address is known (would have to be shared by party B).

Investigate why, and file an action to have the claim re-evaluated.
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:17:53
Actually miners are free to block spam and make smaller blocks. Even if a part of the miners do so, it'll prevent from the max block size from increasing. Using a system similar to how the difficulty work (capped variations) could be interesting too.

You know, I'm bankrupt. No more cash, no more assets, and also I'm mostly burned which means chances of finding a job anywhere are seriously reduced the instant any potential recruiter googles my name.
I can assure you, when the company went bankrupt I had no BTC anymore at all, and by the time MtGox filed to push me in bankruptcy too the trustee took possession of anything that had any value - as required by law. I spent a year in jail waiting trial (still waiting, btw) and by the time I got out I had nothing anymore, no work, no money, no family and no future.
I do not know what kind of evidence makes you think I still have anything. All bitcoins can be tracked on the blockchain, and if I had any it'd be easily located. As for cash, bankruptcy trustee and law enforcement have made sure nothing remained.
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:11:36
Still working on the first question, however as to speed up things, there isn't much I can do anymore at this point, except probably helping with the lawsuits.

It depends on what you are thinking.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:45:32


By law, yes, because these still had value at time of bankruptcy, and value was lost subsequently when those people didn't have a chance to act on their portfolio. It actually makes quite a bit of sense.
As I said before, you should hire an attorney and discuss this further to see what can be done for this situation. Discussing this here on reddit will not affect the procedure in any way.

Usually quite the contrary.
@_date: 2017-04-09 05:11:48
Yes banks do not need legal precedents, but will usually not do it because there are risks (long lawsuits, etc). This lawsuits, should it be lost by Bitfinex, will embolden banks into being more active.
Also banks other than Wells Fargo will likely block Bitfinex too now that they know it happened, because when a large US bank blocks a company, there must be some reason behind this. It will depend very much on the documents filed in this lawsuit in the coming days/weeks.

The word "frozen" is inadequate.
Our automatic system tracked coins we suspect stolen from another point, which means we are likely to get a request from law enforcement to identify you (only within the scope of a current and valid investigation). If we don't have your ID on file, we require one.
We are not to decide if you are allowed or not to sell the coins you deposit on MtGox. This is your own responsibility, taken on your own name. This is another reason we need to have an ID on file that matches your account in this specific case.
As soon as you submit the required documents for verification, you can do whatever you want with the funds on your account. Note that not submitting an ID doesn't mean nothing will happen. If a criminal investigation is indeed in progress, we won't be able to deny access to other identifying records such as IP address and others.
This doesn't mean either we will provide private details to just any court either.

Bankruptcy means that all liabilities of the bankrupt entity are frozen to their yen value (or monetary value in local currency for countries other than Japan) as of the start of bankruptcy. This is true for cash liabilities, securities, properties, etc. except some specific cases.

Would you trust me to hold the remaining 160k BTC until we can sort out receiving addresses for everyone?

@_date: 2017-10-28 23:00:47
As far as I know, those addresses were a MtGox cold storage (unlike 1Fee).
By the way the "marker" thing in this post is someone else, who likely identified those txs one way or another.
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:45:26
Maybe I should have written "as far as I can remember and based on the fact the pattern on those addresses look similar to what I think things were back then".
What I doubt is the fact those addresses belonged to us or not, mostly because I haven't checked against record of the time and I'm not even sure where this would be stored - if I have still access to this anymore.
I cannot offer any firm answer at this point without any extensive research, which I do not feel this particular case is worth of. I know ~80k BTC were stolen on March 1st 2011 (Jed contacted me on twitter announcing this to me that very day) and moved to an address starting with "1Fee" (which is rather memorable) and I know MtGox had some 199k BTC in cold storage that was found days after the start of civil rehabilitation (from there it took time to go through the court and the trustee until an approved public announce was made) but as to remember individual bitcoin addresses, that might be more difficult.

In this case we apply AML requirements from the Bank of Japan because it is not clear at this point if Bitcoin are goods, securities or a currency.

Bankruptcy law specifies that all liabilities are to be valuated as of the day bankruptcy is pronounced. For MtGox that was May 24th 2014, so the rate of that day was used. The bankruptcy trustee specifies on official documents he used the CoinDesk Bitcoin Index price.

First, this came from way before MtGox (the SSH server in PHP was written in June 2010) and the purpose was to allow SFTP access on top of regular FTP to web hosting customers.
I do not think I ever said that daemon was "more secure than OpenSSH", but now that you mention it, it could be argued that it had a lower attack surface than OpenSSH as there was no command execution allowed and it didn't run as root.

I understand everyone went through a lot at the time, and will not hold actions and/or words of the time against anyone (unless these constitute criminal conduct).
In Japan, Civil Rehabilitation mostly means plans are submitted to the court, approved plans are submitted to creditors for voting and whatever plan creditors choose is implemented. The plan can be about re-opening the exchange, merger with another exchange or just straight distribution and closing the company.
We aren't there yet however since the court still has to approve for MtGox to switch back from bankruptcy to Civil Rehabilitation, which will hopefully happen soon.

Right now the minimum is around 200~300 USD, but civil rehabilitation should be able to bring that to ~20% (ie. 0.2 BTC) immediately, and I'm trying to get a plan that would allow the remaining 0.4 BTC to also be due and paid in full eventually.

Typical journalism with catchy headlines. The text is more reserved, but it claims for example that I'd see "no bright future for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies" (pretty sure I haven't said anything like that - Bitcoin's issues are mostly political and managerial in nature, Ethereum's problem is that people are putting insane amounts of money without waiting for things to be tested and stable, but that's not to prevent a bright future).

I say most likely because this is what the available evidence points at today, but I don't have access to the actual server data since only the MtGox trustee has it.
MtGox was running on dedicated servers from day 1, but that doesn't change much in cases where hosting provider is compromised. In 2013 MtGox moved to its own servers in a dedicated space in a datacenter with extra physical security, but prior to that we couldn't even afford this kind of stuff.

1. I'm sorry but I cannot respond to that at this point due to ongoing legal proceedings.
2. At the time withdrawals in BTC were closed only transaction malleability was known, and stopping withdrawals was a way to stop this from being abused as we couldn't track transfers which IDs were changed. While over 1000 BTC were stolen that way, it wasn't expected any large amount of BTC were missing until later investigation in MtGox assets, which then prompted filing for civil rehabilitation.
3. Chances are the hacker couldn't transfer more, which resulted in avoiding detection.
4. The only other shareholder would be Jed McCaleb, but I do not think he wants (nor needs to) claim anything.
Hopefully this case can end soon with all assets distributed to creditors.

1. We didn't have an exact estimate, but following Ulbricht's arrest and shut down of silk road we noticed a drop in activity which allowed put a figure on that at around 20%~30%
2. I received a lot of media attention. I am pretty sure I'm not DPR, but explaining that to people and convincing them is more tricky. There was however no legal repercussions for being named by Ross' attorny since by that time US law enforcement had enough evidence I wasn't linked.  I never talked with Ross but I did exchange a few emails with his mother.

Thanks to blockchain forensics, one person has been arrested last year in connection with the theft of Bitcoins on MtGox in Greece: Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national. At this point however not many details have emerged and likely won't until he faces trial in the US. He is currently pending extradition to both the US and Russia and filed for refugee status, which I understand means that he's still going to be in Greece for a while.
As to storing coins safely, I'd say a hardware wallet, however a lot of care is required in avoiding compromised hardware. Using multiple hardware wallets from multiple vendors in a multisig configuration would probably be the safest at this point.
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:58:52
1. The most likely is that BTC/BCH would be sold for JPY and then taxes deducted (multiple times) before I would ever see any of these. Because of the taxation issue it's likely a sale would be required in order for the value to be stable in JPY.
2. I would try to. I do not think there is any legal background, so it may end being considered donations, which are taxed rather highly in many jurisdictions. Hopefully it won't get to that.
3. MtGox would just implement both systems and let users choose to hold Bitcoins or Bitcoin Cash. We have always tried to remain neutral on this kind of issues.
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:18:05
Actually the May 2013 funds seizure resulted in a banking lockdown, ie. MtGox wires being rejected by some intermediate banks. This was basically the beginning of the end, as being unable to wire funds reflected very negatively on the business.

MtGox has donated slightly more than 10000 BTC in total to the Bitcoin Foundation (founded by Peter Vessennes of CoinLab). The domain names were also donated to the foundation after being initially received from their original buyer.

I'm very sorry about that. As MtGox neared bankruptcy only a part of the business was involved, and parts communicating with customers (customer support was mostly handled by companies hired in India, UK, etc) were not aware of what was happening, resulting in a lot of miscommunication.
Actually keeping communication flowing within a company is far from simple and I was too focused on solving the largest issues (banks, governments, etc) to have time to deal with the issues happening inside the company.

MtGox has two shareholders, Tibanne (88%) and Jed McCaleb (12%). Tibanne has only one shareholder, me. Because both Tibanne and myself are bankrupt there are various layers before I have a say in anything that would happen.
Ideally I'd like to redistribute the BTC/BCH to creditors if it ever happens to be given to me, but hopefully things won't get that far as a very large chunk would end being lost to taxes, that's why Civil Rehabilitation is so important.
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:43:55

The most likely scenario is that BTC were stolen from the servers, not through a bug in the code. I have asked the trustee for an image of the server at the time, but this could be an issue with our hosting provider of the time, like what happened with Linode hack (which also ended flowing to Vinnik).
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:25:27
According to the trustee, previous sales happened "not on an exchange". There have been a lot of people telling the trustee and the court to not sell on exchanges, and it's likely the trustee followed such advice and either ran a private auction or sold OTC, however whoever bought coins from the trustee may have sold.
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:57:27
After the heat death of the universe, maybe.

For example if you didn't receive a letter from the trustee letting you know bankruptcy started, you could try to claim with the court you didn't know. At this point, and considering mtgox.com shows details on the bankruptcy, it'd be difficult however.
Also if for some reason you were unable to file a claim (for example you were in military service), you can then file within 1 month of not being unable to file anymore.

1. Multiple reasons for that, from the security concept of cold wallets to others I cannot comment on yet.
2. Only a limited numbers of employees, our lawyers, the court, and the soon-to-be-trustee.
3. No idea, this document wasn't made by me, but I'd guess it was an estimate on how much would be needed to keep MtGox alive.
4. Missing 95k BTC doesn't equal being insolvent. That's actually a rather complex issue currently being discussed in court, so I can't enter into the details at this point.
5. I've been doing a lot of things to keep the company alive. I didn't spend as much time as rumored on the café, I guess what you call "fancy door locks" is the security system used in the 2012 office and wasn't especially time consuming either, and as to creating yubikeys I had to create the process, so of course I'd spend time on this in 2011 or early 2012. Making the company work is the only way to solve the "massive debt" you mention.
6. I never blamed malleability for the loss of all missing Bitcoins. 
7. At the point I had requirements to be tweeting, but couldn't mention anything about the ongoing proceedings. Sorry if it appeared as I didn't care.
8. Nothing much. I was trying to get in the office and I had a lot on my plate that day. I shouldn't have been that cold to Colin, but I didn't really know how to react to his confrontation.
9. Poor service, bad food. Would not recommend.
10. I am innocent. Proving this in front of a Japanese court is a challenge but I'm not giving up.
11. Like many old websites and account it used a very old password that ended being well known of the MtGox hacking crowd.
12. I was angry at Jed, mostly because his own account was hacked and resulted in the whole event, yet by contract I had to protect him.
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:25:08
The BTC found at the time were given to the MtGox bankruptcy trustee as being part of what was in MtGox.
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:38:19
In many of those cases you either ended with your computer hacked or password stolen through a phishing site. It's an unfortunate issue with online transactions and while some methods can help (2FA) it needs extra effort to setup.
I'm sorry MtGox didn't stop it in your case. We've setup rules to detect this kind of accesses and prevent transfers, but there's a difficult line to draw between protecting users and inconveniencing users. I wish there was a better way.

Civil rehabilitation is a bankruptcy proceeding where a business' debts are frozen to allow the business to restructure itself and eventually pay its debts. In the US this is similar to Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

By the time anything is "in my hands" it'd have reduced quite a lot (due to taxes, etc) and distributing it would still end in more costs/etc.

People with no motivation will not produce good work, even if they have the right skills. On the other hand people may learn if they have the right motivation.

You did not need authenticated account to file a claim and the procedure was available online, and in English too.
I understand Civil Rehabilitation will probably open a new window for filing claims, so it'd be possible for your friends to file the claims they failed to file initially. There are also methods that would allow people to file claims even at this point in bankruptcy.

MtGox Poland has filed for bankruptcy and I believe all funds ended being spent in bankruptcy fees, but I don't know for sure as the trustee's report doesn't list the detail there.
I hear many claims were accepted after rejection being fought, and it's likely civil rehabilitation will open a new claim filing window. I'd suggest for everyone to file claims then if they have had been rejected.

I'm afraid the inability to return BTC comes directly from the bankruptcy. Initially on Feb 28th 2014 MtGox filed for Civil Rehabilitation, but following various external pressure (creditors and US govt) the court moved the case to bankruptcy on April 24th 2014.
Now, creditors are working toward switching back to Civil Rehabilitation. I do not know if it'll be possible, but I support wholly the attempt as it seems to be the best chance of seeing a fair distribution of all MtGox assets.

When buying MtGox I should have had people around me to advise me and help with the management starting with the MtGox transfer contract.

Civil rehabilitation is a bankruptcy proceeding where a business' debts are frozen to allow the business to restructure itself and eventually pay its debts. In the US this is similar to Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US.
If filing for civil rehabilitation fails there are still options out there. If everything fails then I'll just have to distribute whatever comes to me.

For your Euro claim, you could dispute the rejection by the trustee within one month, so it's likely too late except that civil rehabilitation, if approved, will likely allow claims to be filed once again. I'd suggest filing again then.

Payments to shareholders in Bitcoin are unheard of, and are probably not an option since taxes on payments to shareholders have to be calculated, which means whatever is being paid need to have a stable value in JPY.

@_date: 2018-04-04 13:09:26
At the time because the cold wallet keys were generated on fully offline hardware, the issue of reliability of the PRNG was raised. To mitigate risks it was found it'd be better to generate many addresses, keep amount smalls and similar to MtGox withdrawals so they can't be differenciated by a third party, and not keeping a list of addresses as it'd give hints to anyone trying to bruteforce the sequence.
I do not know if this fear was justified today, but at the time the purpose was to keep the security to the highest. If I was to do that today I'd use HD wallets and multisig to mitigate risk (multiple generator, and many keys generated from one seed).

It is too late to file a claim but you may be able to do so anyway, please discuss possibilities with an attorney in Japanese law. Also, if MtGox enters civil rehabilitation it is likely a new claim filing window will open. My main suggestion would be to monitor the situation.
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:09:56
In the case where BTC value gets over 100% and the trustee somehow manages to sell those BTC close to their value, then anything remaining on top of the claims (all valuated in JPY) is then distributed to shareholders.
This is to avoid such a case that I am suggesting different ways of proceeding with distribution as things move forward.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:48:49
I am hopeful time will help resolve most of the mysteries remaining around this case. Vinnik's trial will be a key point in this, as the US will submit their evidence against him for everyone to see.
I think the main issue with late bank deposits is that once a deposit enters the bank account, it has to go through AML before being credited. The trustee however didn't proceed with the checks which means deposits were stuck in pending status.
Also, it is difficult for a bank to not accept transfers. The fact is incoming transfers will cost money to the bank even if the receiving account is closed, but it can only take fees if the transfer is credited, so most banks will not want to reject transfers without a good reason.

When MtGox filed for bankruptcy we evaluated the company as being bankrupt. Between its first trade in July 2010 and the bankruptcy in February 2014, MtGox accumulated a lot of history, including various attempts at implementing secure cold wallets back in 2011.
Despite being less secure that actual paper wallet, that cold wallet, a aes encrypted wallet.dat file, still contained almost 200,000 BTC. Upon discovery the BTC were moved to a safer environment and lawyers worked on how to announce this to the court. Announce was made after those BTC were moved to a new paper-based cold wallet with approval of the court.

I have given this kind of answers so often I'm currently working on putting a FAQ together. In the meantime I can direct to you for example [which]( of the [~123 dockets]( of the CoinLab case is relevant, which means you get to search only 50 pages instead of many more. I am also making documents available for free (this time via RECAP, but also on dropbox/etc) when I usually have to go through PACER and pay (not much, but still not free) to get these.
I'm afraid there are many more people around here than I can technically answer to, especially if I have to be much more specific. Right now I'm in my lunch break time and finished eating so I can dedicate a bit more time, but at the same time I am also discussing with lawyers, creditors and others about how we can make MtGox go better.
So I am sorry if I am unable to provide full and precise answers to each of your questions, but I tend to be less nice to people who call me names. You should stop calling people names more often, especially if you're asking something, I think you'll be positively surprised of how people are more likely to assist.
Anyway [my previous post]( should have been closer to what you were looking for, I guess. Feel free to ask away if you have more questions or if I missed something.
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:27:30
Thank you very much.
I don't have control over the Bitcoins in the MtGox estate, however myself as well as many creditors are pushing for the trustee not to sell until a decision is reached for civil rehabilitation.
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:19:18


As far as I know, criminal charges are pressed not by persons but by prosecutors. Since MtGox is a Japanese entity, it is possible US prosecutors felt at the time it was not worth pressing, or maybe this is still being considered.
For civil suits, I'll ask people involved.


The actual evidence (CoinLab bank records, etc) were obtained from CoinLab and others through a process known as [discovery]( Most of the time those documents are not disclosed publicly unless they serve a specific purpose and contain no information that could harm anyone by being released. In this specific case bank statements contain details on individual bank transfers, and as such were not published.
Note that CoinLab, [in their response]( do not deny that those $5M exist, but tries to claim it does not know if those funds belong to customers or not because of alleged subsequent activity.


I believe that's how CoinLab presented things to said customers.


Said customers have a right to privacy, and if they have not decided to disclose their involvement I cannot respond for them.
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:08:59

The trustee needs approval from the court before doing anything, and everything he does has to follow laws and guidelines for bankruptcies.
He has some latitude on how to proceed with different things, but I believe given the situation is avoiding any action that could result in future liabilities.

@_date: 2017-05-18 03:25:42


No idea, I'm not in charge of criminal proceedings in the US.


Because CoinLab started suing first, we just counter-sued. Also, MtGox covered affected customers because of the way things happened.


Maybe because you should, just maybe, start by actually reading it. I'll help you a bit, you are looking for pages 20~21:

I'm sure creditors would love that.
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:48:36


This is still unclear at this date.


Based on what I heard, CoinLab contacted specific customers privately, and dealt with them directly.


Actually there are things going on, just not in the open. I am not at liberty to say more about this.
You are free to believe what you want. It will not change the fact that the lawsuit between CoinLab and bankrupt MtGox is still ongoing and costing creditors money, while I believe it could be settled.

It is a baseless claim made by CoinLab which is asking for 75 million USD from MtGox for having provided no sort of work, instead undermining MtGox's compliance with US laws by falsely representing they were fully compliant.
Oh and it's also preventing this whole bankruptcy from moving forward.

I do not have authority for this anymore. It will be up to the MtGox trustee to do that, and they'll probably make an announce about that in Sept (probably in the lines of "we are thinking about it").
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:18:44
US law enforcement likely already had a copy of the BTC-e database as of January 17th 2017 and claimed based on it Vinnik controlled administrator accounts between 2011 and 2014.
On the other hand it'd make sense for BTC-e to try to cover for Vinnik and claim he has nothing to do with them. The only person who gains from that announce is Vinnik himself - if it was taken seriously it'd be actually negative for BTC-e.
@_date: 2017-05-17 23:49:06


Never gave Vessenes anything that large. Those $5M were funds deposited by MtGox customers to CoinLab after being misled by CoinLab that the service was live.
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:55:20
Actually as I understand, US laws are made in a way so that class actions can be performed without knowing exactly who is involved, hence impossibility to notify everyone. It is assumed press coverage of the class action will be enough. In this case it was quite extensively covered, but if you missed it, [you can access the court records here for free](
As for the actual situation of MtGox's missing Bitcoins, everyone is working on this, and I'm guessing it shouldn't take too long until somethings comes out (hopefully before the year ends, but I have no way to know). For example [Chainalysis' Mr. Levin's response to Mr. Davidson]( "so we actually did find these [the MtGox coins], Chainalysis was the official investigator in the MtGox bankruptcy case and the destination of these coins is definitely known."
For now I am unable to provide any information by myself, however citing things that are already public is fine.

Had MtGox announced the hack prior to bankruptcy, only part of the people would have been able to withdraw, and remaining people would be left with nothing. The purpose of bankruptcy is specifically in this kind of cases to equitably distribute whatever remains. It shouldn't take that long, however, and CoinLab is largely to blame for the delay.

The class action and the bankruptcy are two different processes.
Unfortunately for the bankruptcy the deadline for registering as creditor has passed. I do not know for sure if there is no other way and you may want to ask for advice from a Japanese lawyer.
The class action lawsuit is an opt-out process, which means that if you are part of the class of people affected (in this case US citizens customers of MtGox) you are automatically part of the lawsuit unless you ask not to be, however the class action lawsuit is not about distributing MtGox assets but trying to get extra money by suing involved parties.

I am afraid at this point of time I cannot provide any relevant details. I have no time line of how things will be moving in the future either.

Actually because back in 2009, domain tibane.com was taken. Doubling the N didn't seem an issue, and the domain was available, so things proceeded that way.

As far as I understand, US class actions only affect customers based in the US. I'm afraid I can't offer much more help, if you need you'll probably have to hire a legal expert well versed in US laws.

You should ask for a written document from your bank stating this reason, then send it to info
