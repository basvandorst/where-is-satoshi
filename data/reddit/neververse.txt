Bit coins growth with isnt exponential.  Its successive sigmodal.  Its the pattern that appears in bio physics. Imho.

The miners basically verify the transactions. They get paid in bitcoin by the algorithm to do so.
You can store BTC where ever you like. It is highly recommended that you do offline storage for long term and/or high amount savings. That's called cold storage.
Welcome to the future.

All of those problems are opportunities for people to solve. 
If you can't see them being solved in the very near future I would be surprised. The only thing thats constant in this world is change. Do you acctually think the existing centralized financial structure of the world is going to survive an internet based medium of exchange? Look at what torrents did to the recording industry.
The top 2 arguments of a standard business argument are: does x cost less? And : is x more efficient? 
Bitcoin satisfies these requirements remarkable well for a payment network.

The company stores the credit card info.
If they are hacked, you lose your data. How many times has this happened this year? Home Depot? Target? Who else? Sony? Bitcoin eliminates this problem.

Is bitcoin illegal?

Its highly portable, its divisible, its scarce , then its secure, it's upgradeable. It is literally the best money on the planet by a very large margin.

I honestly want to thank them. The mining race pushed the prices down to a point where I can collect significantly more than say a year ago.
I'm into bitcoin for the next 10 years. This shit is going nowhere, the growth in the sector is amazing and it's going to change the world imho.

I just started setting up my Trezor today. It's a really good experience.
I'm really impressed with the security options bitcoin has nowadays.
Coinbases vault is awesome. I really like all the notifications you get and the time cool down.
Armory is pretty awesome too.
Again, Trezor, I'm really impressed with it.
Overall what anyone decides to roll with, there are a lot of options that make for strong storage. But of course, require responsibility.
I like trezor the best so far.

Fantastic explanation dude.
When I get some time I'm going to give ultra coin a go.

Isn't that how the world works?
What about the people that first settled America? Built the first railways and factories? They were the first ones and got to reap the rewards of their risks.
What about the first people of the gold rushes?
Should everyone stopped seeking out gold because someone did so before them?
How would any system of progress work with out someone being the first one to adopt something?
I assume your talking to the people that just buy bitcoin to hold them. What about the people that build applications for bitcoin? THe applications that build the fledgling infrastructure the bitcoin network needs to succeed. Should they stop because someone holds a bunch of them.
Why didn't you single out Roger Ver? Why not Satoshi? Satoshi controls over a million for all we know. That's a little higher on the pyramid wouldn't you say?
Anyone can get to 400k Bitcoins. The opportunities are there. Get an idea. Learn to code. Don't give up. Build something that helps the lives of a billion people.

Wow fantastic work guys. Imagine if delivery services hoped on with this.

I really think it is an inevitability. Once people start to see how bit coin is faster and cheaper. And not to mention all the other applications you can do with the blockchain. Shit will go crazy.
I honestly pray every damn day that people don't clue in to what bitcoin is. I want the price low for as long as possible.
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:11:53
Holy shit. I had this idea but didnt have the skills to implement. Great work guys.

Great work. Seriously.
What is a bit frightening is that the governments are going to be racing to get that concept into everything.
Open Hardware can't come soon enough.
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:42:03
How do they do good things?
What about Government funded research? I belive ARPA delivered the internet?
@_date: 2015-02-14 17:19:09
This could be a possibility. I think this year long drop in price has scared off the weaker bunch of the get rich quick crowd.
But who knows. I think bitcoin definitely  has a passionate base. The people that believe in satoshis  principles and why they made it. The hodl forever types.I think those people give bitcoin a floor.  But what that floor is? I have no idea. (Hope its 200ish) :)
@_date: 2015-02-08 19:50:41
Do you think the government should regulate things like the environment? DO you think it's a good idea to enforce regulations to stop corporations from dumping hazardous waste?
Or should everything be privatized? [Even nuclear waste disposal](
Governments can do good things.

Exactly, you want the future to be a certain way, OP? Start building it.
