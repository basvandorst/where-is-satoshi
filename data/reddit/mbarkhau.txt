Completed success, or completed failed? For the colour blind it would also be nice to have a checkmark or an X symbol.

Unless I see a message signed with the key from the genesis block or something to that effect, I'm not buying it. I'm betting any day now, the real Satoshi will write a message similar to what he did in the case of Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto: "I am not Craig Steven Wright".

Higher supply of BCH means a lower price and less incentive to mine BCH,

I'm guessing the business model is based on exchange fees or using an unfavourable exchange rate. What kind of percentage are they offering?

Even though I agree, since when is forbes an authority on protocol design?
@_date: 2017-04-02 02:47:55
Yes a stupid mistake by me. I thought the C in bitcoin was 3 wide.

Repost after the bugs have been worked out. This version is confirmed to work by multiple people.
Usage by : go to and from that page press F12 (in chrome, idk about other browsers), and click console at the top right. Then paste in all that code and hit enter.
Then you can just leave the tab open and it will automatically preserve the "BITCOIN" word.
[edit] please make sure you are using version 0.2!

Ok, I reposted
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:20:30
Oh lord. Maybe 20 seperate tabs in private browsing mode.
@_date: 2017-04-02 11:18:03
This is way to ambitious. Check out the updated script: 
@_date: 2017-04-02 12:41:54
The newest version does exactly that. While it's waiting around for the timer, it fills in what it would look like in the future. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:10:15
The last thing I want is multiple versions of this script working against each other. If I were to move, it would have to be a completely different place. I will leave it this way. Just take care of your green smallpox and leave us our BITCOIN letters.
@_date: 2017-04-02 12:04:17
Sorry, link fixed.
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:23:35
You'll have to go to the extensions tab and set "Allow in incognito" for the tampermonkey extension.
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:49:00
At what coordinates? Specifically the top left corner?
@_date: 2017-04-02 11:20:50
Seems like a big if at this point. I'm more for appeasement at this point. If there's a border, maybe they'll respect it.
@_date: 2017-04-02 12:38:19
The script allows the rainbow through. I would appreciate it if you could leave the word Bitcoin + 2 pix margin around it.
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:26:19
You're correct, maybe it works if you set up multiple user profiles in chrome?
@_date: 2017-04-02 02:30:15
The function returns directly after that so i think it shouldn't be an issue. I put in some console output together with drawTile and I don't ever see it appearing more than once.

Italy plans to obliterate bitcoin 
Lets stick to the current script, it is a very minimal logo in an apparently highly contested area. We don't need too many people to get this working. If we can get Italy and France to keep each other busy and leave us alone, we can probably get somewhere.
@_date: 2017-04-02 11:16:13
Maybe disable adblock, use chrome and also check out the update: 
@_date: 2017-04-02 11:02:46
In light of the france invasion, i have made some updates. Please use tampermonkey with this!
@_date: 2017-04-02 02:23:16
I don't think so, as far as I can tell, all of this is browser internal state. The only thing that should cause network traffic is the call to drawTile.
@_date: 2017-04-02 02:04:09
Please paste this into your browser console:
[edit4]: I have at least one confirmation that it works and everything looks ok for me too. Please feel free to use.
[edit3]: I've fixed it now, but I would love if some others could confirm that it is working.
[edit2]: Important, this has bugs! Don't use it yet or help debug!
[edit]: 
This little script will compare the browser state to an image and update the canvas if anything doesn't match. I think it still has bugs, but I thought the hivemind could help with that. Check back on the gist for updates.

Electrum is simple enough to vet and doesn't require a blockchain download.

Interseting, a parasite that helps its host, so it can feed off of it longer.
@_date: 2012-04-16 19:41:43
I can recomend the electrum bitcoin client rather than the original client which takes quite a while to download the blockchain.
@_date: 2012-01-19 01:33:54
This makes me think about figuring out who satoshi is. You might correlate when he made commits to where he would live. You also might look at his coding style and compare it to other open source projects.
@_date: 2012-09-05 11:26:00
Come to think of it, Bitcoin is actually the ideal money for ransom payments.
@_date: 2012-07-23 18:50:02
These are not notes though. From the bitcointalk thread it is clear that the more appropriate term would be check, since it is only intended to be used once and not for circulation.
It may be though, that multisignature transactions open up the possibility for actual bank notes, where there is an entity who can redeem your note. It would have to have actual security features, because otherwise somebody will just copy it and try to redeem the copy.
@_date: 2012-05-17 09:17:49
Awesome, how much does it cost?
@_date: 2012-06-21 22:16:31
I think that as mining reward drops and transaction fees rise there will be an increased insentive to use banks. They will act as clearing houses similar to how banks used to clear the gold transactions of their clients. It is cheaper overall, because you only have to do one clearing transaction between banks on the bitcoin network rather than one for every client transaction.
@_date: 2012-07-23 20:23:08
Shouldn't there be a second public address on these? One to verify and one for the clerk to send the change to?
@_date: 2017-04-02 13:39:43
As long as it runs in tampermonkey it's working fine. It fills out the pixels while it waits for the cooldown so you can see the end result. If you want to see the current state, just open a seperate browser.
@_date: 2012-06-09 13:11:22
I bet you could talk with some of the sellers on bitmarket.eu and convince them to accept cash.
@_date: 2012-07-23 17:30:54
Can you put "In cryptography we trust" somewhere on there?
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:11:01
At this point I'm pretty sure they are a scam. Two months of radio silence and counting. Unless my money pops back up in my bank account, I'll be going to court about this soon.
@_date: 2019-09-05 14:54:03


For electrum you should verify the GPG signatures of your download. Instructions are linked on the download page: [

Shouldn't the bitcoin client start moving the decimal 1 or 2 places at this point?
@_date: 2011-06-20 06:42:01
This is correct, but it doesn't imply that the government needs to be involved. People abandoning MtGox and moving to exchanges which value security is a form of regulation.
I got uneasy about MtGox about a month ago and pulled everything out. I also use unique passwords for every site. The best regulators are the users themselves.

How does this compare to Open Transactions?

"real money", haha, that's a good one.

Supply tends towards 10BTC/min. Higher difficulty doesn't mean less supply.
@_date: 2011-11-19 21:49:41
One great benefit of a banking system on top of bitcoin would be a reduction in the number of transactions recorded in the blockchain. These could be reduced to interbank clearing transactions by having transactions between clients only appear in the ledgers of banks.

Does OB have any dark market aspect to it?
@_date: 2019-05-12 10:15:36
I'm not mentioning it to friends or colleagues, that would just be messing with my signal to sell.

Black suit, gold tie. Coincidence?
@_date: 2013-11-03 12:36:13
Correct, but for daily use people would have farthings, pence, crowns, shillings, etc.
People will eventually start using millibit or whatever bastardization they come up with for it.
@_date: 2013-03-01 22:17:10
Or economic harmonies as Bastiat would put it.
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:47:11
I can't imagine it would be much. Company computers and servers don't tend to have dedicated graphics hardware.

How about this for a business idea: BDIC (Bitcoin Deposit Insurance Corporation)
BDIC will insure all Bitcoin deposits up to X BTC which are held in an online wallet and Y BTC in a wallet secured by 2FA. To be eligible for BDIC insurance the wallet provider must pay a monthly fee, subject the IT systems and software to regular audits, hold 90% of BTC in cold storage and must be personally liable for any losses up to Z BTC. Each owner of a wallet must also provide a bitcoin address to be used in case of reimbursement.

I'm confused by something he said in the advanced video. He claims you don't have to trust the server, because the server cannot forge your signature. From my understanding, that means I can trust the books of the server, but who is to say that these books have anything to do with reality. The books can say what they want in the most cryptogenius way we can think of and it won't mean a thing if the asset issuer runs away with the underlying asset.
From my understanding, and please correct me if I'm wrong, the bottom line is, OT does not eliminate counter-party risk. That may just be the nature of the beast and so I'm fine with that, but then don't go on to quote satoshi about how we should trust nobody.
@_date: 2013-04-06 19:46:58
I don't understand why you would encrypt a private key and store a secret seperatly. Why don't you just use that secret as a seed for the private key?
@_date: 2013-01-05 17:34:14
My guess is that a banking system will emerge, where people have accounts denominated in BTC. Transactions between banks will be entries in their ledgers and every day or so there will be clearing transactions between the banks which actually appear on the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-12-27 01:10:48
Ok switch the server, sure, but the asset issuer is the entity who holds and is responsible for the asset if I understand this system correctly. Don't I need to trust them?
