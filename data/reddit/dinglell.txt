Congrats! Simple things can really change your life. I was mining I'm 2012 but got bored and stopped. That's my worst regret in life. I hope my investments now will improve my life going forward. For years the thought of banks running the world and that they would never allow crypto to work set me back. Wanna help a brother out? :)

I feel safe with my paper wallet. Created offline with ubuntu on a fresh usb.

Bitcoin will be used to help the world but people are also evil and greedy!

This resonates. I got into bitcoins when it was worth nothing and started mining on 3 different computers and started websites promoting bitcoin faucet affiliate sites. Eventually i lost interest for a few years. Saw the price ricing again and started investing on mt.gox but lost alot of coins when they shut down... Then i lost all faith in crypto and was sure the government wouldn't allow crypto to keep going but here we are at almost 12k and i kinda want a bullet to my head. I lost the opportunity of a lifetime :(

Tell her you have 50-100 btc max. Love is a crazy thing and can end abruptly. Money makes some people go crazy.
Stash at least 100+ btc away and forget it for 5-10 years. 
You are a lucky man and she will be one happy lady. Be smart my friend!

I got support after a few days with the ID deal. They are growing insanely fast so be patient :)

This is my hodl wallet so I won't touch for many years. The first time a made a paper wallet I accidentally scanned the import code :/ But this wallet is clean!

That's awesome. Sadly I'm only hodling for future profits but i would love to use it as a payment method for everything.
