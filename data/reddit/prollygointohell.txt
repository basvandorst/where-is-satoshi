Diving deep my friend

Probably won't be the last.

Wow, dude. Congratulations! That's what I call gettin' your hustle on! I hope to make it to that scale with a much smaller investment. Kudos to your success! May you have much more :)

I think I read somewhere that actually completing the blocks is slower on Bitcoin already than other cryptos. I think I remember seeing something crazy like 7 transactions completed/second on BTC vs. Like 20 or something on LTC. Again, I don't really know what the hell I'm talking about, but my assumption is that just doubling block size would decrease the speed of block completion further

The future is here my friends!!! Let us all rejoice! (I think I'm starting to become a BTC convert. Any idea when Bitcoin will be more widely accepted for goods.

Wow.. you got it bad bruh. Why not just invest in the large ones?
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:38:34
I like roads. And little things like that. Taxes are a necessary evil.

Only in BF4
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:37:53
Um.  Because I have no idea what any of that means currently. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:50:19
What are faucets?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:55:10
.... I think you might need help. Or less salary -- obviously you're making too much if you have that to blow.

There are no easy answers, 100% agree. It was an off-hand comment. In any case, you're right. Governments waste tons of money

What do you mean? The whole point of bitcoin is to invest in it and get rich. Aside from that, people don't care. Not enough merchants accept Bitcoin, IMO. 
If it became a more widely accepted form of currency in everyone's day to day life, not so prone to fluctuation in price, it would be something. But as it stands, it's a redistribution of wealth with potential to cause catastrophic harm to actual economies; to most people.
If Bitcoin were to be accepted at more retailers, restaurants, etc. it might be super useful. Unfortunately the fluctuations in price don't help this.
Edit: Yes, I'm fully aware that I'm probably going to be downvoted to oblivion for this. Sorry I have an opinion.

Honestly, that's one of the pluses (imo!!!) of litecoin right now. Lower transaction fees, instant trading. Makes litecoin seem like a decent investment. (I'm new to Bitcoin and trying to wrap my head around it all, please don't flame me too hard).
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:14:38
Sorry. I'm new here. Just learning about BTC. But I'm sold on it

Judging by your username, a lot of aspects of socialism don't appeal to you huh. I  believe that healthcare should be a universal right, not restricted to you get what you can afford to pay for.

Now the "libtards" and "snowflakes" are taking action, not serving them.. And they want civility. Ironic.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:27:01
Oh, no. I'm actually asking. Kinda new to the idea of bitcoin. I've heard of it a few times, but no idea what they do with the money sitting around.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:31:06
Ok, so if there's a finite number of coins to be mined (21m from what I understand) how is it that these coins will maintain value? And what is the essential value of this? Can you move money via bitcoin without having to tax it?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:15:00
Just out of curiosity, what exactly do these funds do with the money while it's sitting in their possession?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:21:57
Institutions. Like BCH or whatever exchange you use for your cryptocurrency fancy. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:39:46
I will likely never own a BTC in it's entirety. Well, let's never say never.  But my point is I'm just trying to learn about it. Have you considered investing in alternate cryptocurrency's?

You should look into predictions from The Simpsons. They've really nailed a lot more than was mentioned here
