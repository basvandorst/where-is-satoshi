you could try taking it to a recovery specialist.  that's just a guess though.

I don't know why people keep giving Roger airtime.
He just repeats the same sales pitch over and over.

Bitcoin is deflationary.

It's the same.  Some exchanges use XBT instead of BTC.

I bought some IOTA with my BCH money.  
My IOTA got hacked and stolen.  I ain't angry.

Miners are jumping between coins, expect it to clear soon when the miners jump back to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:57:01
That's just wishful thinking.
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:26:14
It's deflationary because less and less new coins are created.

Why do they never ask for Bcash?

S2X was planned before Bitcoin Cash.  BCH seemed to come out of nowhere to take advantage of the UASF hype.

One is Bitcoin.  The other is a scam.

Looks fine to me.

They don't have to articulate it.  The incentive for miners to do their work is profit.  All their arguments are underlaid with this incentive.  They (Jihan) will protest solutions that undercut their profits.  
Their idea of scaling is to increase fees to replace the mining reward at a level that supports them. (Jihan's multimillion empire)
@_date: 2017-06-03 03:12:15
Sure.  The mining reward is set to diminish over time.  The miners want to protect their profits by increasing the blocksize to allow more transactions and fees.  However, the Core developers have a different solution that doesn't include a blocksize increase, but still increases transactions.
This doesn't satisfy the miners need to protect their profits so they've been holding out for a blocksize increase.  Which a small group of miners can do, because they control a large chunk of the hashrate.  
Which is also part of the argument about the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.  Then there's the part about AsicBoost....  but that's the gist of it.
