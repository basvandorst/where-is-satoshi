Are you guys able to create virtual credit cards in the US? if yes, that would be a way to go around this kind of issues
@_date: 2019-07-17 08:58:59

A good way to invest indirectly in land and housing would be REITs.  
You get yourself exposed to the housing market, without the hassle of managing the real estate

just checked the website.  
For a company that exists for 6 years now, the home page has quite clunky UI :|

Those thumbnails most definitely generate him a ton of views.  
With just 23k subs and he gets 24k views in 5 days. Achievement unlocked.  
Doing click bait properly

I don't understand the use of nodes regarding transactions.  
All I know is that when a block is mined, it will have stored new transactions that are in the pool waiting to be "processed".

Now I believe I am. I will hold 1BTC for a lifetime. At least that's my plan as of now.
@_date: 2019-04-19 12:22:36
what the flying fuck
@_date: 2019-04-10 09:05:50
Wow, nice detailed answer!  
Now I have a clearer picture what nodes are actually used for!  
Thanks :D

~~That is a fake license plate.The "S" is for Sweden~~. It's an European licence plate.
~~That is not allowed by the license plate system~~.  
So it seems I'm wrong, and in Sweden you are allowed to have custom license plates.

Sorry for the late reply.  
First thing, the scroll of the music genres does not work properly.
[   
Second, there is no Metal genre.  
Third, this is not supposed to show like this  
[  
Forth, improve your font. This one does not look professional

the question I always ask afterwards, would I have hold for that long and not sold when reached just $30??  
I mean, turning $1 into $10k it's pretty dope.

The problem is not so much about having guessed the top or not.  
Some years back was more about if bitcoin was really being adopted and if people actually valued its intrinsic properties.

the most annoying thing is, she is calling him out on BCH, "The fork was on Bitcoin CAssH!"
@_date: 2019-01-21 08:59:06
"Western Union charges about 10 percent per transaction.
That means that a person wanting to send money overseas could save a lot of money buying Bitcoin at a Coinstar machine and sending that instead."
This is still not a valid use case.
Even though 10% of your whole transaction is a huge steal, you cannot trust bitcoin's volatility.
And then, there's the hassle of converting bitcoin back to fiat in order to be able to use it.
If you live in India or China for instance, this is a problem for you.
@_date: 2019-01-21 09:19:31
Definitely, completely agree. But current volatility is just not our allied.
In a matter of days, you may have more money, but less is also a possibility, as we all are very well aware of.
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:28:39
So it still is gonna go to $7600??   
Ok, gonna wait to buy that dip then!!! :D
@_date: 2019-05-01 08:41:02
Crap, alright then, my bad.
@_date: 2019-05-01 08:40:17
Okay, should kept on reading.  
My bad.
