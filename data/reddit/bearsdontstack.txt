OP has quite the post history about bitcoin and the fed. I'm thinking he didn't just learn it today. However, TIL that OP is a bag of sticks, so that's nice.

You should probably mention it to them then.
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:51:11
Who is this *we* that you keep talking about? I don't care what you believe, but if the dude filming believes he is SN, then it would make sense to believe the statement that he suffered a stroke as well.
If he doesn't believe he is SN, he's just a douche bag annoying some random guy that wants to be left alone.

I think Bitcoin is great for what can do, but I really don't like how ultra libertarian so many of its proponents are. Really damaged my view of the community once anyone that voiced non-libertarian views just started being berated. They're no going gain a lot of support by acting like that.
Dogecoin's community is insanely welcoming, and even with this ~~change~~ not-change in the protocol, I think it has just as good of a chance at succeeding as Bitcoin does, just because the community is more accepting.

Yeah, bitcoin's maybe be more "serious" but the community is definitely full of more assholes, which definitely puts people off.
@_date: 2014-10-28 04:24:43


You're not wrong, but this isn't a good argument. Just because things are a certain way, doesn't mean you should just accept it. And considering how political so many people in act, it's really embarrassing for 90% of them to be sell outs.

You have no idea what you're talking about. The benefit they receive is in the increase number of users running the protocol. The more users on the network, the more anonymity there is for the users.

Google takes 30% of the revenue brought in through the Play store. What's your point again?
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:53:42
Sure, like the Amazon store, which also takes 30 percent.
I'm not debating that Android more open than iOS. That's a given. I was just commenting on how ridiculous a statement like "No one's allowed to make a lot of money through Apple devices except for Apple." is, when on average iOS is the most profitable store for developers.
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:42:28
Except for all the people making money in the App store, right? iOS apps still outperform Android apps on average in terms of revenue.
Sorry to stop the circlejerk.

OK, let's say I know someone who is a contract killer, and I help him hide the payments from people ordering the hits, so that the authorities don't catch on. Is it your opinion that I haven't done anything wrong?
@_date: 2013-05-09 05:17:02
Sure would make it harder to operate a business that accepts bitcoin though. 
@_date: 2013-07-02 23:54:09
Are you deliberately misconstruing what I say?


I agree. **I never said differently.** I don't know where you're getting this stuff.
Something doesn't have to be unethical to be a crime. Sometimes bad laws are written that criminalize ethical behavior. However, that doesn't change the fact that when that happens, even ethical behavior becomes criminal.
You haven't provided a good argument for money laundering being ethical behavior either, because you keep ignoring that in the act of money laundering, one is participating in helping someone get away with a crime.
If someone kills someone, they have committed the crime of murder. If they tell me, would it be ethical for me to provide them assistance in getting away with the murder?
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:56:43
I'm simply refuting the statement that made
@_date: 2013-12-28 20:39:44
That's cool, except I never mentioned Windows Phone at all. Additionally, what's the Windows Phone market share? 3-5%? Doesn't seem to be where the money is...
@_date: 2013-07-03 00:16:29


There you go, redefining words again. I don't care if you think it *shouldn't* be a crime. That doesn't change anything.


I'm not talking about the person escaping justice for murder, I'm talking about the person that helped them do it.


The analogy isn't that money laundering is like escaping justice, it is that it is like assisting someone in escaping justice. *It's the act of helping someone hide evidence.*
You really need to work on your reading comprehension.

If [their orderbook]( is accurate, there isn't much trading going on. I don't think that many people have been verified yet, and with so few users there's no real reason to move BTC onto the exchange yet.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:34:38
Especially if the private companies could just ignore the people living in areas which were more expensive to service.
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:13:59
Assisting a known criminal conceal their profits from a crime is actually exactly what money laundering is.
In this situation:    
1) I know that the money is "dirty"    
2) I help make the money appear to come from a legitimate source.
If both of those thing are true, then it's money laundering. That's just all there is to it.
EDIT: [Citation](
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:51:51
Why shouldn't assisting people in concealing their profits from illegal activities be criminal? 
You do know that's what Money Laundering means, right? It's not just trading money, it's doing so to help someone get away with a crime.
EDIT: Seriously, where are you getting this idea that money laundering is "made up"? There must be someone with a pretty big group of followers promoting this nonsense, for all the times I hear the **exact same phrase** in this subreddit...

It's the 10 most exciting startups, not 10 most profitable startups.
@_date: 2013-07-03 00:53:45
But you _do_ have to know the money was gotten from an illicit source. If you don't know that, it isn't money laundering, it isn't illegal, and isn't a crime!
Money laundering doesn't apply to "clean" money.

I don't think wikipedia should care what the media thinks of Bitcoin. It isn't unstable if they used something like BitPay to handle the transactions.

OMG IT'S A CONSPIRACY GUYS! 
Or -- a lot of people don't like these posts cluttering up the subreddit. This post isn't about bitcoin, it's about OPs paranoid fear of government. 
@_date: 2013-07-01 01:04:25


Just because you keep on saying something, doesn't make it true.
Money laundering is knowingly engaging in a financial transaction with the proceeds of a crime for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property. 
It's like how you can be charged with aiding a fugitive. The crime is helping someone get away with an illegal act.

YOU DON'T NEED TO DIRECTLY HARM SOMEONE FOR SOMETHING TO BE A CRIME!


[BECAUSE IT'S ILLEGAL.](
@_date: 2013-05-29 00:43:17


That's true. That's why money laundering is


So it isn't a fictitious 'crime' at all. Money laundering is a criminal activity, even by your own definition. 
Whether or not Libery Reserve is guilty of that crime remains to be proven though.
@_date: 2013-07-02 04:37:28


What money are you talking about? Laundered money? By definition, for money to be laundered, it has to be "dirty" to begin with.


I agree. I never said differently.


So, we agree then..


I don't know what you're getting at. I never said I cared at all about where you deposit money. I didn't say people should have to prove it's honest/clean.


I never said someone was *directly* harmed by money laundering. I *am* saying that it is not a "made-up" crime, like many people here believe/
If you want to buy and sell things for Zerocoins to protect your privacy, *go right ahead!* That's completely okay!, but if you are using Zerocoins to with the **intent to help someone get away with a crime**, then that's **not okay**. 
I'm also not saying their idea of setting a limit is a good one. I made no comment on that at all. I also didn't say anything to imply the government should invade your privacy for that. I just am saying why money laundering is a crime.
I don't know where the confusion lies here.
@_date: 2013-07-01 03:20:44
"Money laundering is the process of making illegally-gained proceeds (i.e. "dirty money") appear legal (i.e. "clean")."

Also, "Virtually" when used like "Virtually [impossible, spotless, pain-free]" isn't more precise anyway! It is one of those bullshit meaningless marketing words.

What does that even mean?
@_date: 2013-07-02 00:27:15


I don't believe it is ethical to aid people in hiding their ill-gained money.


No, there are two crimes. One that got the person the money, and the crime of helping them hide it.


And you have to know it's dirty money for it to be money laundering!


What's your point? Banks aren't there just to disguise where people get their money.


It is when it's done to hide the origin of the money. That crime is called MONEY LAUNDERING.
