This is ridiculous.  It also completely defeats the purpose of bitcoin, so it won't happen.
Max tx per minute will increase and fees will stay low, or maybe even lower (once more people start using, miners will need less fees from each tx).

The point is for them to not know they are bitcoin keys.  No one will give ideas on how to do this, because it would negate their security.  Just think of ways that YOU can easily get your private keys, but someone else would never even know they were private keys.

This is it.  It keeps competition.  It's unlikely we'll see monopolies, but even if there is, the competition from being able to eschew them entirely will keep fees low etc.

So many unexpected places to use bitcoin.  I was just on an Australian aquarium site the other day and went to check out and they accept bitcoin.  Was buying nootropics on another site and they accept bitcoin (two of them in fact).  Although I guess nootropics would be more in that scene for bitcoin acceptance.  There was also a bulk meat supplier in Australia which was probably the most surprising of all.
Feels so good to just see it randomly when you don't expect it.
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:55:23
Not really.  It was a darknet marketplace containing many things besides drugs.  It was set up as a place to buy and sell anything, except for weapons.
Pretty much exactly the same as the postal service really.

We can only have 6 letters in Australia :(  Guess I have to wait until all 6 letter/number combinations have been used up.  I think it's getting close at least, coz we're getting to Z's.

Shit, just wrote this above.  Would not surprise me at all.
@_date: 2015-01-20 02:08:20
You can do the same with bitcoin companies like Circle (and Coinbase I think?).  Except it's cheaper because bitcoin is overall cheaper to use compared to traditional banking systems.
@_date: 2015-01-10 03:03:26
Heh, you think that's bad, I moved my coins from btc-e to Gox because of some vague untrustworthiness of btc-e.  Lost all my coins and meanwhile btc-e is still going strong all these years.
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:57:38
Nobody is stopping you from using btc-e.  Go ahead.  Having a regulated exchange does not stop you from using an unregulated exchange.
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:54:37
Exchanges are a part of the bitcoin community, or ecosystem, exchanges are not bitcoin.  Bitcoin can be "regulated" but it can't actually be fully regulated, since anyone can choose to be anonymous and not comply with regulations.
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:40:53
Yep.  But it was a "mistake".  Somehow.

They have to hire many people to do the job that blockchain does.  That is where all the cost is, as well as good old monopoly-granted insane profits.
Bitcoin remittance businesses can drive down cost and introduce competition.

Checks out guys.  Coincidentally I just got to 3 the other day :D
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:37:24
Yes, what I'm saying is they don't have to charge as much because bitcoin is cheaper overall to deal with.  Coinbase and Circle have insurance, which you obviously pay for but not as much as with traditional banks.
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:46:05

As much as people made fun of this, those exercise balls are the most comfy "chair" you could ever use.  Minus whatever stands they had them on, they're also good exercise just because you have to balance constantly.

Ok this is a good point.  Hadn't even thought about that.  You could have minimal processing power from GPU's (or a more efficient specialised device) being used forever.  No need to scale up "mining".  People already devote a lot of processing power to things like folding for no immediate personal monetary reward.

Allegedly?  This was never proven and they aren't prosecuting him for the "murders" precisely because the evidence is non-existent.

Their system is way more fucked up because it's a mix of public (obamacare) and private.  He had to compromise due to insane conservatives, so a lot of people got fucked over (can't afford private, not poor enough to get obamacare).
From my limited understanding.

I'm in my 20's and would have no savings if not for bitcoin :P  
Unfortunately my savings keep diminishing....
@_date: 2015-02-23 23:36:08
Because it devalues every day, basically wasting my work efforts.  Because I want to be able to spend my money whenever I want.
Because I don't want to end up having a Cyprus situation.
Because my bank's security is shite anyway.
Because the fees are ridiculous when they're already making money off my money.
@_date: 2015-02-24 11:29:36
Hm, they could just do the same thing with bitcoin though, right?  Even if through bitpay or coinbase etc.?  I don't see why they couldn't.  And as said, opt in for pure bitcoin payments.
@_date: 2015-02-19 08:15:16
Yeah that doesn't really make a tonne of sense.

Get on and get advice, read a lot.  Don't just take whatever, they aren't all safe.
I can recommend piracetam only.  The other drugs are not well studied like piracetam.  But still it is only useful for a short time (my theory is once it's repaired all the oxidative damage, it can't really help you after that).
Actually, Bacopa also has quite a bit of research and is safe.
@_date: 2015-02-24 11:35:41
This is it, they have a "pay what you want" option.  It is perfect for bitcoin.  I thought they accepted BTC for some reason and was about to send .01 BTC or something for an album.  Paypal would take a big chunk of those small payments.
@_date: 2015-02-19 08:12:52
No I think we do.  We need as many nodes and also miners as possible.  Or rather, the more the better.  Not everyone is going to do that of course, but we need to keep pushing for it because more people will start doing so every time it's brought up.
If we just say it's okay and never talk about it, it will slowly become more centralised.

Why?  Don't they have to be?  Otherwise coins would disappear?
@_date: 2015-02-24 11:48:33
I'm talking long term.  Bitcoin loses value now.  If it was more widely adopted or had stabilised adoption rate, it would slowly gain value or at least not lose value.
I don't know what the odds are, truth is no one does.
I am not FDIC insured because I do not live in the U.S.
Yes we do have something similar, but I was just pointing it out.  That money has to come from somewhere, which is either taxpayer dollars or created from nothing, causing inflation and devaluing of circulating dollars.
My bank charges at least $5 a month on average for transfers depending how much I do.  This is the best account I can find, no CC, nothing except a bank account and bank card.  It costs them basically nothing to transfer money.  Bitcoin offers a much fairer value and you can do it for free if you want.
@_date: 2015-02-15 23:22:53

Yeah, I'd just rather make sure it doesn't become a problem, instead of getting complacent.  It should ideally become part of the community's general consciousness that we make sure there are sufficient nodes and miners.

I've been thinking about this a lot recently.  I don't see bitcoin being used mainstream to buy stuff in physical stores.  It will be niche for that purpose, although we'll have way more users than we have today.
OTOH, *everything* that can be done better with decentralised, trustless backend will use the blockchain.  We'll obviously have to increase TPS and probably compression of the blockchain.
If we can do that, it will be used for more things than you can think of today.
