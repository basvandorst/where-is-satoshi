I made an account just for this, How pathetic is this? this hedge fund manager is just sad as shit that he didnt get in on the hottest investment since the tech boom, 
Sorry that you couldnt use your inside information to profit because we all know during earning season all you hedgies do this, SAC (Mr. Cohen the billionaire) recently got caught probably because he was doing it horribly, 
If guys as bright as this are running hedge funds I should open my own because from this one statement a majority of the BTC community could do a better job than this clown

Bitcoin is so far ahead of its time people just dont realize how beneficial it is, 
Few examples
Have you ever called in and told your CC number to someone? this person can easily siphon your data and use it else where, not with bitcoin
Have you ever wanted to buy something without your S.O. knowing? 
People while paying taxes always wants to pay the minimum, how can this be done legally? Bitcoin
his argument is not open ended he clearly states that bitcoin is going to fail while I believe it is not, 
This guy is OLD and there is a whole slew of NEW GENERATIONS that havent even been exposed to BTC in which these people ONLY KNOW TECHNOLOGY, 
Bitcoin is only going forward and there is not many things that can be done to make a "Better" Bitcoin
