Call 1 satoshi 1 bitcent. And call 100 bitcents 1 bitcoin. Rebrand the current bitcoin to 'old bitcoin'. Bitcoin already has a strong brand presence. Send a clear and concise press release, notifying everyone of the change. Some people will be confused about the sudden price drop but most will get it.

About slowness of transactions: I don't want to sound like your grandpa, but back in the day merchants accepting credit cards had to make an actual phone call to the credit card company to verify that the card was real and had enough credit to do the transaction. Then they had to take out this heavy and clunky device to manually make a carbon copy of the transaction and the card. AND still pay a transaction fee that was less lucrative than cash. 
Still, most merchants accepted this inconvenience because their customers demanded to be able to use this form of payment.

ICT consultant here with 15 years of experience. UlyssesSKrunk is right. Floating points are not meant for financial data. They lack accuracy even at the first decimal. For something like bitcoin they would be a nightmare. Floating points are designed for other things, like 3d calculations where accuracy matters only to the point of calculating a granular pixelated screen. For financial calculations, you want the slower BigDecimal and other integer-based solutions.
Off-topic, I think bitcoin would be more succesful if they split the coins once the value of them becomes something off-putting for everyday use. If the average buyer only has the means to buy 0.01 bitcoin, it should be multiplied by 100, multiply every existing bitcoin wallet by 100, and change the price for bitcoins accordingly. But that's just me.

Won't work. Scammers can easily create a phony wallet app that can display fake transactions on screen, and looks exactly like the real thing.
e: ok apparently I misunderstood. Sorry. However, this method looks really high-tech/crypto geeky to me, so it may take a lot of effort to educate merchants on which transactions are genuine or not.
