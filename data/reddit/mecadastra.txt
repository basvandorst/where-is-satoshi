Developers released btc1 and miners "advertised" their support for it. So what else do you need?
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:51:36
The same thing with segwit

Are you talking about 2 MB blocks? /s
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:40:05
It has 90+% support from miners and you know that every now and then this sub gets filled about waiting times and high fees. This update seems a no-brainer to me
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:59:21
I completely agree
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:46:16
It's in their best interest to keep bitcoin useful, their profits depends on this. And increasing the blocksize limit was always in bitcoin's plan. It's not a big deal.
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:48:42
So the people who tried to force segwit on everyone are protesting saying miners want to force 2MB on everyone. Right.

He is talking about an attack in the sense of someone trying to reorg the blockchain and steal funds, not upgrading the protocol.
To upgrade the protocol Satoshi says the hashrate is the way to do it.

Did you read StopAndDecrypt post? I just copied his answer and changed miner with node
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:25:12
I agree with you that many times proof of work is used within consensus nodes.
But that specifically part of the white paper I think talks about changes in the protocol too.


That's what we are doing in the block size debate, using proof of work for decision making.
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:00:11
And what if 99% of the nodes were consolidated into a single location, run by a single entity, and they decided to divert to a different chain that were incompatible with all the miners?
Would you be ok with that?
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:38:43
It's proof-of-github now? LOL
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:37:47
That's like saying you are not forced to fill a 2 MB block.
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:33:45
No, this line from satoshi is right. But he is talking about someone trying to steal funds, not upgrading the protocol.
S2X is not trying to reorg the blockchain, so it is not an invalid chain.
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:45:38
Many core developers believe we should increase the block size limit. They want to attack bitcoin too?


It's not me filling this sub with thousands of thread against S2X.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:46:31
And what do you say about this part of the whitepaper. Do you agree?


@_date: 2017-09-28 23:22:45


From here:  Search for "vote"
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:00:40
What about those extra SegWit bytes?
