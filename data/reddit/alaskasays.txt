Ah, that makes sense, thanks. I guess my second question still stands. Given how huge a transaction this turned out to be, should I be worried about it not getting confirmations? I've had it take hours and hours before and I'm hoping that's the case here rather than be stuck unconfirmed.

It seems like it was a bunch of change from other transactions.

How do I get access to that information? I have no idea how many blocks I waited!

Oooooh this is a cool tool. Thank you!

Yeah I saw that, I just don't understand why it has so many inputs from the same address?

It just confirmed and received four confirmations so I'm good for now. What can I do in the future to ensure my transactions always go through? Will increasing the fee help? What else?

Thank you for your help!

I get my mistake in not adding a proper fee. Believe me, it'll not happen again. I'm asking what happens to the money already sent, the fee for which I can't retroactively alter - will it sit unconfirmed forever or does after a certain time frame, does it get reverted back to me?

Thanks for the info! That answers my question. Just minutes ago I finally got a confirmation and now we're up to four. So glad it went through. I have literally never had to wait that long.

So should I be worried about future transactions if I set the fee to 0.0002+? Some people on that sub make it sound like it's a gamble whether a transaction goes through or not.
