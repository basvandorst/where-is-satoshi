Yup, but I guess it's always a step forward. More and more people hear about bitcoin at least.

Did it really work with bitcoin? From my experience, bitcoin is often marketed as a payment option but when you ask the personnel, they have no clue about it.

I found it really difficult to understand Bitcoin at first, although I tried to study it. Mining, fiat and all that stuff. The real turning point was when I actually had a small amount of Bitcoin and wanted to transfer it form one wallet to another. In a way it felt like miracle: "Is this really so simple?" 
So yes, I don't think you can make "non-technical" people fully understand everything about Bitcoin once and you probably shouldn't even try as it makes all just too complicated. Give them examples, something they can relate to.

I was the only one who used it, but according to personnel, there had been "some interest" towards the machine. Didn't go on Monday when it was opened, though. No grannies lining up – yet ;) I was the first one who purchased something with bitcoin at the record store.

Bitcoin is a great way to teach kids (and adults) about economy – I must confess that I didn't know myself what fiat money was before I came across with Bitcoin. 
Also, I'm currently studying to become a teacher and we had a lecture about how to teach about society for children. Some students suggested that people from "neutral institutions like banks" should visit schools... Let have your son there, instead ;)

No, it doesn't. Just scanning the Bitcoin address.

I just tested out a Bitcoin ATM here in Helsinki – the experience was really positive and I think atms could be the way to get more people to give Bitcoin a try. The thing with atms is that people are already familiar with them – the biggest difference that normally you get banknotes out, with Bitcoin atm you put them in... Also the atm might feel safer for people, as it feels more concrete than dealing online.

Yeah, online for sure. But I wanted to "cold call" and test Bitcoin at a local Christmas market organized by art school students. Seemed like a good chance to also market Bitcoin a bit, not sure about the outcome though.

Yeah, I guess it would be neat for beginners, if you could get your bitcoins printed on paper. This one didn't have that option.
