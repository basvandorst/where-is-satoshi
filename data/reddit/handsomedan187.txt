I also find the best way to introduce people to bitcoin is through silver bananas.

That might actually be OK, I tried to Google it, and came up with mixed results.

Oh, that sucks. Someone should put it on youtube or something.

Ya, I didn't even pick up on that. He or one of the writers must know a little something about proper bitcoin terminology.
@_date: 2016-03-09 16:30:58
Damn. It's not even working for me anymore. Is it working for anybody?

Yup you can spend bitcoin on pretty much everything except gambling. The new btm is a lot better than the old robocoin they used to have also.
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:53:51
Its a joke bro. If I didn't say "no homo" there would've been "Lol you love the D" jokes. Why not address it upfront to discourage that silliness? I guess saying "no homo" is now hatespeach sorry for not keeping up with the politically correct handbook. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:06:48
I said "no homo" after I said "I love the D". It seemed appropriate. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 13:26:14
The non smart ass answer is no. The gaming commission would have to OK it first before any casino could do it. But you can cash out your btc at the btm and gamble if you want.
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:50:04
Agreed. The bitcoin community needs to support these businesses that are brave enough to put their ass on the line for some harebrained new currency. These guys are going out on a limb for us, so maybe we need to get out of our moms basements and support these brave pioneers who have a lot more to lose than us. Please don't let our greatest allies look foolish in the face of the naysayers.

Fremont street has a different vibe than the strip. It's definitely worth checking out. I personally like it better, but many would disagree. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 16:18:41
True. But they have forked over the cash to train and buy whatever pos hardware is required to accept bitcoin. They are also paying to promote it. At this point they are among a very small percentage of merchants willing to do this. In that way they are pioneers.
Edit: I probably was a bit overly passionate with that post.
@_date: 2015-04-23 01:19:21
I personally don't think the joke promotes anything. If I was homophobic I wouldn't be joking around about loving the D. A joke is a joke, laugh or don't. I don't understand how you can take a penis in your ass without complaining, but a harmless little joke hurts you so much.
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:12:13
Lol. No clue.
@_date: 2015-04-22 13:45:51
I think its just a newer version robocoin, no hand scans and no waiting to get approved. It does want a pic of your id  but the camera is so shitty I'm pretty sure its worthless. The price mark up was also pretty bad. I just bought a little bit for the novelty of it.

Luckily on reddit all it will cost me is down votes from the hypersensitive politically correct Nazis.
