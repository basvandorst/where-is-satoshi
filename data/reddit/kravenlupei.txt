RFactor 2 or... Which is this? I don't follow many of the Simracing league games, tend to stick to stuff like DRally.
Damn though dude, that's some nice stats of viewership to brag about; Never would've expected it from a sim racer.

You know you can stop replying at any time, right?
Me, I'm enjoying watching your meltdown at this point.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:18:05
Yeah, which is why the  rule is "Any money in is immediately worth $0"
If I put $100 into BTC, I immediately write off that $100 as being thrown into a fire, it's worth $0, it's garbage, it's *nothing*.
If, at some point, that money comes out of the fire, in larger or smaller form, hey, it's more than $0.
I don't invest $300k or huge money like some people; I only do what I'm willing to **IMMEDIATELY** lose. And it's a hell of a lot more exciting than doing the same in a Casino; Plus I dont have to travel.
Is this the norm or how it should be? Probably not, but it's what I do, and if the asset drops to 1%, it's still more than the $0 I've got my current stake valued at.
That all said, I don't think my held coins are going to permanently collapse; But who knows? It's a gamble and I acknowledge it as such. I'd rather lose $100 across a few years of BTC rising and falling in exciting moments and dramatic newsstories than seeing it immediately disappear in a hand or few of Blackjack.

[This one time bitcoin crashed.](
Anywho, you're obviously quite upset and getting ranty and angry now over nothing. Why not take a Xanax and leave Reddit for awhile? There's more to life than defending your reasoning over why memes are so good and getting angry at internet strangers. 
If you lost money and want to rant about it, go shout into a pillow maybe. Take a nap; Maybe the price'll be back up when you're awake. 
Or if you think it'll keep crashing for the next week and hit $0 feel free to shove it in my face in a week; But I'm willing to bet a week from now we see the usual crawl back upwards. And if you can't handle dips and only wanna see constant rises, well, that's on you for thinking this is "sure money" or whatever nonsense you told yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:33:32
I wonder how many people care less about the technology than the "I dont want Banks touching my money" aspect.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:47:53
Remember kids, you add to the discussion by talking, not spouting dumb memes that have been heard a thousand times already.
If you have something you want to say, try saying it with actual talking points, eh?

@_date: 2018-01-17 11:40:45
I mean, it's too early to discuss perhaps?
The "Lets wait and see" involves... Waiting and seeing. 
Sometimes the best you can do is either:
 A) panic like some people 
B) do nothing and hold on for the best 
C) give it a few days and see what the average is doing / what's happening across a larger timeframe and maybe missing a boat or 
D) look at it a longer period later and go "Man, if only I did X or Y back then..."

Man I didnt think it was this popular
May have to look into it...
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:44:45
If anything, I feel like now is "the time to buy".... but that's only if you think the price will go back up before you sell.
I feel like it's not what a lot of people want to hear now because they're tired of the "lol bitcoins on cheap sale" meme, but really, these *are* the days I'm putting more money in because... I'm willing to bet that I can sit on BTC long enough to make some returns down the line. And if I don't, hey, the bit of money I'm willing to lose by putting in goes a bit further at $10k / coin than $15k / coin.... Assuming it ever goes back up =P
Those who are looking to make daily money or play the trading game are those who panic most I feel; Those of us who are slowly buying up BTC with the intent of a long term hold don't mind.
Realistically, end-game goal for me is to not even "cash out" my BTC and such into fiat, but just ... Spend it as I need. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:25:12
Sorry, I'm not 14, I don't care about memes.
I care about having actual discussions with people instead of thinking I'm funnier than I am thanks to collective joke trends.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:36:21
Losses aren't losses unless you convert to fiat or spend, right? Or am I crazy?
I've got a set "don't sell until X" date and it's still a few years away. All these price swings people panic about... I don't feel it.
I know "hodl" is a meme, but really; I'm in this for the long game, not the daily drama, so why should any dips *now* bother me?
Now, if the dips continue across a few days and the price actually starts tanking to the floor, it's another story, but until its' the story for a week or more, I won't lose sleep. And I ain't cashin' out then either; If at my sell date I have no money in the game, it is what it is; Not like this is my only investment in life.
I always follow the rule: Never invest more than you're immediately willing to call "Worth $0" until it's spent or turned into fiat.

Don't recall tbh, but I don't remember the fees being anything I actually noticed or was upset about the last few months of quite a lot of trading in/off exchange.
In-exchange, USD-&gt;BTC is ~0.25 cent per trade though, which is another huge upswing for me.

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:57:08
I remember it was about a month ago people were all excited that Bitcoin "might" hit 10k before the end of 2017.
Even on this downward trend we're still way above what was once speculation and dreams.
Everyone just needs to be a little patient I think. Let the dust settle.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:31:27
"Oh no, my money has decreased in value in a known-volatile market! Better panic sell and solidify my losses!"
Buy high, sell low.
Wait... That's not right...
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:38:24
Surge of mass adoption IMO
The more people get involved, the more news talks about it, the more people see the price rise, the more people get interested.
My entire family has been asking me about Bitcoin lately; Can't imagine I'm alone in this.
Plus tons of people taking gambles on the upcoming CME Futures opening.
Anyway, in my personal speculation, price'll drop 1-2k across the next 2 days as some hype levels off, then around 17-19th this month price will either drop another 2-4k or surge up 5k. This is all baseless guesses though so.... Heyo.

Nice triple comment and alt account downvote storm
Must suck getting called out on your agenda by a 30 second Google search, eh?
Anyway, stay salty and sad. Finding out what subreddits people jerk off around in has become par for the course ever since all you posters who frequent decided to tell us over here the world is ending. 
Luckily I care more about telling the truth in comments than the downvotes of spam accounts. Or I'm being honestly downvoted and people don't care that the people spreading FUD are frequents of . I'm sure that's the case, right Mr. Bcrash? Money &gt; Karma on Reddit, but keep pretending I care about your mass downvote spam like it'll silence me.
Either way, BTC has risen right back up today and is still climbing. Anyone still crying about how it's all coming down has an agenda or I'm Saint Nick. FUD'ers gonna FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:36:36
So much FUD in this post.
75% of the comments here are people calling you a fool but I'm right alongside you buddy.
Ahhh posters, comin' here to try to spread fear when they think we can't check their post histories and see their usual chat spot.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:02:36
Gotta spread that FUD when BTC is recovering or Bcrash might actually look bad when BTC hits 20k again while Bcrash tanks ever lower.
It's *so* apparent these days; Just check their post history, sort by top, and giggle.

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:28:47
People are panic buying/selling *hard* after big Crypto news, which always involves volatility in both directions for at least a few days.
Smart decision says don't do anything for a week.
Risky decision (myself included) was buy the dip.
I'm not too worried. I am, however, enjoying watching Bcrash fall down after being told by all the users the other day how BTC is dead and their coin will easily shoot to 5k+ in 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:44:51

What, like, 2-3 weeks ago?
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:39:43
After 3 weeks of constant rises?!
It MUST be a bubble popping!
I was told Bitcoin ONLY goes up and ONLY gives me a profit and now it went down a little so FUCK BITCOIN. I was GUARANTEED money.
Big fat &lt;/s&gt; for those who need it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:31:27
Only when responding to people who scream the sky is falling at the exact time Bitcoin price is climbing back up.
Anyone panicking and telling people to sell at a low just because of a dip is a much bigger cunt than me; Those types make people lose money, I just am the guy telling said types to fuck right off with their drama.
Anyway, nice alt-account storm, as if anyone on any subreddit goes into a 30-deep comment thread and upvotes/downvotes the posters. Ah well, gotta keep up the charade of being important somehow, don't we?
End of the day, BTC price still rising, still will, and a month or year later all these posts about how we should panic sell at 12k will be *fucking* hilarious in retrospect. See ya then.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:45:44
The drop on the rollercoaster is always the most terrifying at first, but the most exciting and fun... And then when it's over you hope for another one.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:03:18
Whatever you say mate.
Keep pretending the sky is falling while it's going right back up, eh?
I'm sure your panic posts are helpful to the community. Does your anxiety flair up with every BTC price shift or what? No, wait, you have no money in the game; That, or you honestly expected the price to do nothing but keep rising, in which case, please, leave. We don't need more people only here looking for a quick buck.

I'm 99% sure it was Coinbase back when it was $4 a coin mate.
What other exchanges were around back then? I remember I had to send a damn Moneygram in at CVS to get Bitcoins back then haha.
If that wasn't Coinbase, what was it? Do you remember? I honestly just thought it was CB; I used them at some point and abandoned them, but perhaps it was a different exchange before them?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:37:46
Volatility in a volatile market and everyone runs around screaming.
Im more worried when the price went from 15 to 19k in a period of a few hours. At least dips mean the market is normalizing again.

The only ones who don't like the memes are those either A) with an agenda or B) those who seriously believed they could put money into BTC and receive nothing but straight 30% daily gains for month after month.
We don't need either type of person; The type of person who just laughs and has a good time about it all is much preferred to the sticks in the muds telling us the sky is falling on a daily basis by those who bought in and swore to themselves it'd only rise just to turn around and run at first sign of a dip.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:11:34
And all the comments seem to revolve around users laughing at his expense.

@_date: 2017-12-23 00:01:58
Those who ran away in fear ... 
I don't even know
I saw someone say his "break even" point was 12.5k. A month ago it was 8k; If you've been in the game for under a month and expected nothing but constant rises throughout for a quick buck, I have nothing to say but "buh-bye hun"
Weak hands looking for a quick buck don't belong in this game.

10 minutes may be slow in 2017 and the world of instant purchases and credit cards etc. but...
There was a time not so long ago Checks were used for purchases and until that check was cleared by the bank, it was just paper.
Hell, I even remember mechanical credit card machines... 
Now, obviously no one wants to go back to checks, but is waiting for full confirmation necessary in cases of small purchases?
If someone does something like steal a lunch by the confirmation not going through, they have their name put on the wall or cops are called; same process as a dine and dash, no?
For larger purchases like tvs and such it starts getting more wobbly but...
I dunno. Just playing some devil's advocate. Thoughts?

I've been slowly trying to explain it to him but for a guy who still uses AOL it's not exactly easy.
You don't have to frontload information on the technical knowledge of how Bitcoin works for them to be interested and put money into it. 
I basically explained it as akin to a new country's currency; like USD to CAD, not to be treated like a stock or such. 
Anyway, no idea why you're upset over non-tech-savvy people entering adoption of BTC unless you have some anti-BTC agenda.
Plenty of people drive cars and have no idea how they work. Plenty of people invest money without knowing anything about the company/platform they're investing in. Why be elitist against people who don't know every technical detail?
Edit: Redditor for 6 years, only active in the last year, ONLY in crypto trading subreddits. Mmm love those social media shill accounts that can be bought.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:02:20
To that, all I say is [This one time Bitcoin dropped ALL the way down to...](
Bubble or not, every time the price drops it has gone back up. (Until it doesn't haha.)
Either way, I make sure the first thing out of my mouth to my family every time is "It's risky, it's not sure, and if you put money into it consider it good as gone for 3 years."
Basically, telling them to HODL. Price may drop from 11k down to 4k, but .... Just sit and see what happens has been my advice. I'm telling them explicitly not to use it for a quick buck but to toss in "fuck it" money if they want, and to not touch it for a long period of time, through Hell or High Water.

Yeah, volatility is growing pains IMO
This year has seen bursts because lots of news articles are picking us up, people are getting interested, etc. etc.
I'm sure there'll be a time when it levels off for awhile; It may crash before doing so, but we *did* have a period of, what, 3 years of stability before explosive growth?
Not to say crashes are needed for stability but... When speculation and wild money starts to settle into stability and "value" is ascertained for awhile, it'll stick until more money dumps in suddenly.
Maybe. I'm not an economics major :D

I am so glad I sold my BCH at $1500 and bought the same in BTC when it was $~6k flat.
Not for any drama reasons mind you, just... Never bothered to look much into BCH or care much for it. I'm still aiming for my end-goal of one full BTC Coin before the end of 2017, so the fork just gave me a chance to hold BCH til a good sell point, which this certainly turned out to be. BTC is just the coin I've known for years and, well, close to one coin makes me wanna just get that last bit and just complete a personal goal of sorts.

Again, glad I ditched Coinbase years ago for Gemini.
Best move I've made thus far.

You say this, but aren't *you* the one speculating that these people aren't going to use it for purchases?
Just this morning when talking to my sister about buying a Treznor for the gift with some BTC on it and I mentioned I could buy said Trez. with BTC she was curious and interested and started asking what other services have started accepting it as payment.
The point is, the first step to *using* currency is *holding* the currency. The first step to *holding* the currency is *understanding* it, at least a bit. 
My sister has already been told at least a few times by me how BTC can be used for large international purchases / by companies for lower transaction fees than credit cards at times, etc. etc. etc. 
Sure, Bitcoin may be a bubble, but hearing "It's a bubble" anytime anyone ever talks about more people adopting it they seem to miss out that to *use* BTC they have to actually get some and get some understanding about how it works.
If I told my father he could make a $20k USD purchase and pay $5 in fees on it instead of normal credit card etc. fees, he'd be ecstatic at the opportunity. And trust me, he's the kind of guy who *does* dump huge sums of money at whims on certain things, being a business owner in construction. Any time he purchases material for jobs, he pays large fees... If the supply house accepted BTC for low fees, he'd jump at the chance.
