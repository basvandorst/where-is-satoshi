He could make more money if he invested in Ethereum since he lost his btc in 2013 or 2014 it was very early stage 
Or at least invest in Qtum ico or NEO or dash I mean there are so many opportunities in life why u didn't try to convince him to re invest 
I have seen many people concentrating on one coin like this is the only chance to get rich and buy ATH
Take for example NEO many people invested at 0.01 sats while now the price is 0.003~
I made profit in WTC and dragonchain icos while many are waiting for Qtum,neo,tenx,eth,sia, Digibyte,ripple to give them 100% profit only !
Think out of the box and don't fall in love with these coins ��
Think big make 10x better than waiting ur loved coins to recover ur losses or just cry why u sold too early
Anyway I am very sorry to hear ur brother story :(
