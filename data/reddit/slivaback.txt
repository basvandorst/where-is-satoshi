If btc becomes the world currency and 1% of the worlds population own 99% of btc, you seriously think the 99% won’t outvote the 1%?

I admit I’m a total rank amateur at this, however here’s an alternate view from myself. As seen In This picture   there’s two major, medium term trend lines that converge in mid April. What happens that this point will be crucial imo
@_date: 2018-03-19 09:05:44
Sometime in mid April two major trend lines are going converge. Hopefully that’s where a major breakout upwards occurs

In a way it’s not bullshit. If enough people, with enough money to make a difference are brainwashed to look for certain things and act on them a certain way,  then it becomes a self fulling prophecy. Without self fulling prophecy it’s voodoo

Some idiot decided it'd be funny to stick 109 btc for sale at 11.5 on gdax. :(

to me it looks like someone is angry and is trying to buy every bitcoin in existence. My guess is it's Vladimir Putin or John McAfee

Trtlprice. Once you're in a hole,  please stop digging. I've lived in the UK for 37 years and almost everyone I know has at least one credit card. Between the three people who live in my house, we have eight credit cards between us. Everyone I know has a debit card.
It's not only poor people who have credit cards either lol. Most poor people don't have credit cards in fact. Most poor people in the UK use loan sharks and/or wonga style companies.
I've no idea where you are getting your info, but literally everything you said about the UK was 100% wrong

These dips are needed. Pure explosive, exponential growth will lead us to a massive crash again. I’d much prefer a “slow” continuous 1grand per month gain than 10k a month gain, becuase if you time it wrong, you can lose a lot very quickly

In places on this planet  due to weather conditions or volcanic activity you really can have an endless supply of free electricity :) Miners can take advantage of this. Banks cannot!

Bitcoin is incredibly stable. 1 bitcoin will always be 1 bitcoin. It’s only unstable when compared to fiat. If and when everyone is paid in bitcoin and every can be bought in bitcoin/pay taxes etc. If and when fiat no longer exists, bitcoin will be stable, more stable than fiat.

They are traded in usd becuase the USA is probably the biggest purchaserof everything and that gives them a lot of say,  OPEC can change their mind anytime they want though :). Has nothing to do with the usd stability.   Apparently Goldman Sachs don’t even think the usd is the most stable currency. They think it’s the Japanese yen. :)
what So politically stable from Switzerland, vs Germany, France, U.K., Australia, Sweden, Norway, japan, Canada or the USA?

@_date: 2018-04-15 09:24:20
The usd isn’t the world’s strongest currency. The U.K. pound is stronger, so is the Euro and there’s plenty more too. The fact that major commodities such as oil are pegged to the US dollar and it’s still not the strongest currency means in my mind it’s an incredibly weak currency that’s actually being propped up well above it’s station.
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:17:36
I have no experience with that exchange. Assuming it’s the same as the other 8 exchanges I have used you need to go to add fund section, find bitcoin and if an address exists copy it. If it doesn’t exist there should be an option to create an address, then copy it. Then go to coin base and withdraw to the address you just copied. onky send a small amount like 0.000001 the first you send to it. If it clears then send the rest.
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:35:37
You don’t need a key, you need to log in your quadrigacx account and deposit the btc to the correct address.
@_date: 2018-04-15 10:52:13
The usd’s stability is becuase of commodities being pegged to it. It has nothing to do with the “fact” it’s has some inherent strength due “not being invaded”. If opec decided on a whim to change the trading of oil to the uae or saudi currency, the usd would collapse overnight. The pound and euro and are equally stable without needing their hand held
The USA has been invaded to, it was created by an invasion. Since the ukpound has existed, the U.K. has never been invaded, nor will it probably ever be. I’m not really sure what point you’re trying make here :/
Oh and the second I can pay taxes and buy everything I need in btc, I’ll sure as hell have 100% of my finances in it
