Virtual byte introduced by segwit. Acts as an incentive to use segwit as transactions issued from a segwit address have a smaller virtual size or weight; so basically a fee reduction (less vbytes)

Most of the market cap is from coins that **wont move**, be it die-hard hodlers, lost coins, satoshi’s stack etc. They’re not available on any exchange
states coins that are actually being traded would be worth around $10B USD
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:19:11
I completely understand this and agree with you.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:40:16
That’s really well written. Saw the headline on my chromecast yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:16:44
Yeah. But then anyone can boot up tens of thousands of AWS VMs, or any hacker can use a botnet, and 51% attack any ASIC+GPU resistant PoW alt-coin (is there any?)
Game-theory says that it would never happen unless it’s economically viable: no one would spend a fortune to destroy a crypto-currency, let alone an altcoin that is barely used, when it’s way more profitable to just mine and profit from it
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:26:04
yup same ��
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:05:42
Stick with your plan. Don’t forget exchange fees. Be patient. And don’t trade more than your ready to loose.
For me, patience has always paid. Except for those ER20 tokens that I’m glad i only put 100-200$ max cause those investments have been shit lol.
Just don’t ever panic sell man.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:51:45
If you try to buy anything near $1B of bitcoin, I can guarantee that the last coin you’ll buy will be much more expensive than the first one.
... and also your scenario makes no sense as 50B/8 &gt;21M

[This source]( says it's 0.04294967296 bitcoin which is about 700 dollars. So close to 2^22 satoshis, but not quite
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:15:52
Yes, hold. It will bounce back eventually. It always does. A coin that reaches an ATH (against BTC) has bounced back from every crash its had ��

@_date: 2017-12-10 17:29:33
I would remove coinbase as it’s all running of gdax.
Also, how do you calculate the fair value? Do you prorate all the exchanges by 24h volume? I would suggest doing this if you don’t, a tiny exchange with a big sell can move fast and leave a huge spread for a while

@_date: 2017-12-10 18:46:37
No, that’s not what I’m saying.
What I’m saying is that, given:
1. Bitcoin is a technological advancement showcasing a S-curve adoption pattern in which we are still the early adopters. 
2. Bitcoin is an open-source protocol, and not a stock.
3. Bitcoin has doubled 4 times since january 2017
Who in his right mind would pick a short over a long?
If anything, Bitcoin as a stock would look more like Amazon’s, Google’s or Apple’s than Radioshack.

I’m just talking about reducing risk here, not trying to control an extremely unpredictable market 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:10:10
If you want to invest 17B$ to buy 1,000,000 BTC, you kinda need a way to hedge some of it against a lost of value no? (extreme example)
Think Walmart or Amazon or Ebay building up a stack for when lightning will be ready.
Well, the only way they get into bitcoin is if they can counter a long position (hold) with a short position, effectively reducing *their* price volatility in a major way 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:41:04
Yeah and a global 24h volume, that way you can quickly compare with coinmarketcap to see if your missing a big exchange (like bithumb)

@_date: 2017-12-14 02:50:01
Your github link on the lnd implementations is indeed a better source!
Those limits are arbitrary set in each protocol implementations and are bound to change over time as then implementations mature.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:38:26
That’s a great way to pay a shitload of taxes on short term capital gains though.
Instead of converting to fiat, you can use another crypto that has the inverse arbitration, and pay much lower fees too when transferring back. You could even chain 2-3-4 exchanges in a dynamic loop. The 6-conf delays could be deadly if any currency drop during a 1-2h in between exchange transfer though 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:34:22
You are reinforcing his point 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:40:59
Yes it’s an hyperbole.
But what’s more likely in your opinion? A) btc to 1K or B) btc to 30k?
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:28:04
Recently logged back in an old slushpool account i hadn’t used since 2013. Wasn’t deactivated. Unfortunately i didn’t have any btc left either.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:38:12
I would be a sight to see those candles on an exchange for sure. But anything close to that value has to get traded OTC
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:32:51
I wasn’t clear, the headline was shown on the screensaver 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:31:07
Yeah but 1000x your risk, is that a valid argument?
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:34:39
Exchange have patterns, for example GDAX is always higher than finex. GDAX is driven higher by design: quickbuys on coinbase are always posted at the higher end of the spread, driving the price up.

Just install breadwallet, you’ll understand.
The seed is a series of words that can be hashed to generate your private keys. Super important that you keep this secured.

Depends on the alt. Some are definitely hodlable (the money coins with good capitalization)
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:57:37
´( 10^-8 )*(1&lt;&lt;24)´ is ~ 0.16 btc though, seems a bit high. But i havent checked what the bcutil.amount function does though.

hahahaha well said brother, well said 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:22:34
Change PoW? All the current miner would be out of business and go bankrupt. So you’d lose all security, and it becomes an alt at this point.
If that happens it’s game-over for bitcoin, the market crashes for many many years, lots of people die, and most people from the current generation never trust any crypto-currency again.

You make a profit at current difficulty levels. But difficulty never stops increasing, so your profitability will go lower with time. If you can't make your money back within 2-3 months then it's better to actually buy the coins...

This is massive news. That's the onramp for 1.7 B users to a cryptocurrency wallet, Calibra.
Am I the only one visualizing Libra as being this massive bitcoin side-chain? With coinbase (and surely other exchanges in the future) allowing bitcoin/libra trading pairs, this could fuel a massive demand for BTC in 2020-2021.

I wonder what’s the base rate of Hydro-Ontario vs Hydro-Quebec?
Edit: looks like ontario is &gt;2x more expensive than Quebec and Manitoba, and among the most expensive provinces in Canada

Learn full stack? Take some online courses on backend development and add that to your skill set? Dude front end devs are super important, and coding backend is really not that hard when working on a project with a decent architecture.
I don’t know, but I hate to hear a fellow web developer having such a hard time at least in NA.

Dude wtf? Sorry man but either there is something I don’t know/understand about your situation, either you just don’t want to work.
Software development is starving for experienced developers, and most employers would likely let your work remote as long as you deliver quality work.
Fuck I should know I’m a software engineer and i employ about 15 people right now, and good experienced developers are as rare as pope poop, at least here in canada.
Anyways, concerning your bitcoins, it’s so little i don’t think it’s gonna change your life whatever you do with them, so use them for food or anything that helps short term, straighten up your life and invest again later when your back on track. Good luck.

Assuming you meant 15 NOK. 
What about when the price is 14.5000 NOK, who wins the free half NOK, the seller or the buyer? (I’m guessing the seller)
We do something similar in Canada, the government removed the 1 cent coin from circulation, so all prices are rounded UP to the nearest 5 cents in favour of the seller/shop owner.
Buying something worth 11.36? You pay 11.40

Small correction on the APY.
At 0.1% daily, provided you renew your loans everyday, and spend most of the time lending (let's say 80%), gives a much higher return than 15% APY.
Using a slightly adjusted compounding interest formula : `A = ((R+1)^(N*(1-P)*T)-1)` 
* R = interest rate = 0.1% = 0.001
* N = Number of periods = 365
* P = Poloniex fee = 15% = 0.15
* T = Percentage of time lending = 0.8
* A = Annual return = 28.15%
So, the annual return would be 28.15%. Might be super hard to attain 80% of lend time at 0.1% all year long though!

On the Trezor, you get the fingerprint hash of the firmware displayed on the screen before updating.
You can then validate it’s the same fingerprint being shown on the update screen in the wallet website.
So in the case of the trezor, the site would have to be compromised to have user download a compromised firmware, but you can also valide the fingerprint in their github repo.
I’m pretty sure the ledger allows for similar double/triple checks

There is no such thing as a “full bitcoin token”.
Bitcoin is infinitely divisible.
To answer your question, if most bitcoins are hodled then the remaining bitcoins (that are up for sale, for instance in exchanges) are going to get a bigger valuation, in turn making more "hodlers” open to sell.
Everything has a price.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:35:08
You’re talking euros or pounds?
