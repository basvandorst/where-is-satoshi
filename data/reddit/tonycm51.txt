You are diluting the market, a stock changes it share structure from 1 million to 1 billion, previously it could only sell shares to 1 million people now it can sell shares to 1 billion people.

but with gold an atom has no real use, where as bitcoin is just a number on a screen representing a value

I understand the point, but whenever i talk to passionate bitcoin people, they like to highlight the 21 million coin cap, I find it worthless. The fed printing more money is basically like bitcoin just adding a decimal place

I know I'm going to get a lot of passionate bitcoin hate on here, just posing a question hoping for rational non biased answers

I appreciate you not treating me like a child. I seem to have a better understanding but still am skeptical

what if bitcoin pulls a share split type of move

lets say we have 100 and 1.00, lets multiply 100 by 10, we get 1000, lets expand 1.00 by another tenth, 1.000, 1000 and 1.000 have the same amount of number places

People that longed in the 200's and 300's on futures are cashing out, it was a matter of time. They are up big so once the first domino dropped it sets off the chain reaction.

Best option: Christ
Christ is always the answer

Cheaper buy in

You just made a post in reaction to the price dropping quickly

I agree with the $300 statement, but the link does not work
@_date: 2015-11-04 22:13:32
Given that most of the people here are new to bitcoin, I'm guessing a lot of them don't even know what futures is.

Also less regret, I was close to buying but held off, feels good

I think I just lost brain cells

The litecoin pump a few months ago ran a similar track
@_date: 2015-11-05 06:29:53
Even if you find this info, are you going to feel any better?

Put a limit order in at like 325, will at least flash crash to there for a minute, have you not watched bitcoin
