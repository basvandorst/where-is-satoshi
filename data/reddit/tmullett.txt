;-) who's scamming who?

Sounds like an urban myth to me. The address is a parameter you put in the mining software that hands work off to the ASIC device. All the ASIC knows how to do is compute hashes. 
For that matter, how could anyone tell (if there were any preconfigured addresses) that they belonged to BFL?

Yeah, I'm not extremely happy with BFL lately, but it's more the lack of communication than anything else, which I think is a result of them being simultaneously overwhelmed and demonized. In general I'm with you on this.
Our first order of gear was delivered and works fine. The difficulty passed it up. Yup. That's how it works. Get over it.
I'm just amazed at how many of the whiners around here don't understand the basic risk/reward formula. If you're going to jump into a hashes/sec arms race with gear that (they tell you up front) hasn't even been produced yet, there are going to be some risks. If that's too much, then just stay out.

Lots of businesses provide products that other people use to make money.
The logic here assumes that a business over a year ago could get the development of those ASIC devices funded on the basis of a skyrocketing Bitcoin price that nobody at that time had any idea would happen. I think that's incredibly unlikely
What's more likely is that some hardware manufacturers see a mining arms race that, for a while, is a sure source of income. Mining itself is a much less sure source.
