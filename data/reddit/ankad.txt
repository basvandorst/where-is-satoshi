Capitalism, Consumerism, Growth Fanatism, Throwaway Culture, non-renewable-Industrialism, Disconnection-from-Nature, mind-boggling Wealth Inequality, etc. ... are seriously endangering the survival of mankind. Humans are blindly causing an anthropogenic mass extinction; chemical, biological, and radioactive pollution; and are changing other important parameters of the whole biosphere we depend on. 
You spoke of "our future Bitcoin-using Benevolent Robot Overlords" - but apart from those robotic successors - do you see a realistic chance for human intelligence to survive much longer? 
And please: How do cryptocurrencies help with those REALLY important challenges? And if they don't - why are cryptocurrencies relevant at all?

I would still like Gavin to answer to this. 
How exactly are cryptocurrencies relevant if they don't tackle the most urgent real challenges of our species? 
Or, different angle: What is missing from bitcoin to make it relevant?

Or if bitcoin is not ready for that yet - what would a future cryptocurrency need additionally to help tackle the most urgent real problems of mankind?

Thanks for this answer. 
Not sure that I agree, though. If someone holds 10000 times more bitcoin than someone else - that's a lot of centralization. As system which gives the rich much more power than the poor cannot be called democracy. That's oligarchy, or plutocracy. 
"Removal of power from the individual and redistribution to the whole? "
 
Who is 'the whole'. The rich whales are not 'the whole' ?
But thanks, anyways. Interesting thought, I just don't get it yet.

ah, so there is no easy way to snoop how much micropayments have already accumulated, unless the server operator chooses to disclose that?
