Hey I'd rather not speak to anything else in this thread officially (I am just a developer), but if you've specified 'medium' risk for an invoice you won't get a 'confirmed' IPN until your invoice reaches one confirmation. It's possible your server is instead seeing the 'paid' notification which is sent to let you know the invoice has seen a transaction that indicates a payment from a user.
You may want to check your server and make sure that you are checking what the status is on the IPN, I believe the possible states are 'new', 'paid', 'confirmed', 'complete', 'expired', or 'invalid'. You shouldn't consider it good in your system until you see one for 'confirmed'.

That assumes the email providers are using SSL to transfer it between each other. Many do not. Remember [the NSA slide](

Feel free to look around [here on our GitHub]( to see if what you are thinking of is already being discussed. If not, feel free to create new issues.

I can't give you any kind of ETA, but I just added this to our feature queue.

Yep! :)

That awkward moment when jason's old reddit account retiring gets a similar vote count as us opening our european hq.

Just a heads up that this is using the old api. We now have api v2 which is [documented here]( and we have a [nodejs client]( which you can use in your projects. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 02:04:21
Just to update on this issue, all invoices affected should now be completely normal. If one is not, please do not hesitate to contact us at support with the invoice url and we'll take care of you.

Its mostly about levels of support. The free plan is email support only while the higher paid plans are for phone support and having your personal account manager. The [pricing page]( gives a good breakdown.

We're aware of the issue and are actively working to restore service.
Just a reminder that you can also [run your own BWS server]( if you're worried about availability. It's all open source.
Edit: Things should be responding normally again.

Looks like cointelegraph doesn't have SPF hard fail enabled in their DNS. If they updated their DNS SPF record to use `-all` instead of `~all` this would no longer be possible. Remember that you can flag messages like these in gmail by clicking the dropdown and mark as phishing.

They are load balancers that are no longer in use and are no longer online, but seem to have been cached by whatever this service this site is using to enumerate servers. Tried to see if there was a way to refresh this check but doesn't seem there is a way.

I'm not on that dev team, I work on the merchant services systems. However, since that product is open source you can request features like that via [issues on GitHub]( or even contribute the feature yourself if you're a developer through [a pull request](
@_date: 2015-01-07 09:00:45
What device are you on? Also if you aren't already aware you can [report issues on the GitHub project]( Please take a second to search for existing issues to try and prevent duplicates though.
Thanks for the feedback.

The test page for bitpay.com seems to be showing some of our old load balancers as vulnerable. These hosts are no longer and use and are no longer online, but the service appears to have cached them at some point and it seems there's not a way to clear that cache.
We are secure.

This does sound familiar, but in all seriousness [regtest]( is your friend, never wait on a block again:
`./bitcoin-cli -regtest generate 1`

Unfortunately no, I am a developer not a spokesperson, just defending code here :)

Just chiming in here, we do not make breaking changes to our merchant API endpoints unless we have to for security reasons. We have not made any breaking changes that I am aware of.
It looks like the issue they were actually seeing was the an outage in our outbound webhook notifications this morning. During this time our API was still functioning normally, only we were unable to automatically send notifications to merchants that their invoices were paid.
@_date: 2015-09-24 15:19:03
Sure, so the easiest client-side way to mitigate for this would be to have a check in your code which fires if no notification has been received after 15 minutes, and if you want to be super safe another in 1 hour. This check would be to simply get the current status of the invoice via the API, and if it's fully paid it should follow the same logic as if a webhook had just been received.

Woops, you are right. Mine is just the source of the node bindings. Good catch.

Hey, sounds like you have a lot of questions and seem to be very confused about the services we provide. Since we just launched our [Visa prepaid card]( I am unsure if you are a merchant or a card holder, so I'll cover both, but regardless BitPay is not like paypal where you send funds to other people.
The BitPay merchant program is designed to allow businesses to easily accept bitcoin as a payment method. Examples of our merchants include Valve's Steam gaming platform, Namecheap's domain services, or Newegg's online electronics store.
If you are instead one of our new Visa card holders, congrats, however again, this is not like paypal. This program provides a way for you to easily convert bitcoin into USD for making purchases at merchants who do not yet accept bitcoin.
You do not **ever** have a static bitcoin address when using BitPay. We have a large pool of addresses and temporarily assign one when an invoice is generated. Never attempt to reuse an address otherwise you may lose those funds to another merchant.
There is no way to send money, BitPay is not a wallet. In our merchant program we accept bitcoin on a merchant's behalf, and then pay out in the form specified in your account settings. You can choose to have all the bitcoin transferred to an address you control or choose to have a percentage converted into fiat (USD/EUR, etc) at the exchange rate set when each invoice is generated and sent to your bank account.
For the merchant program here is our documentation: 
For the Visa card, here is our FAQ: 
If you have additional questions you can reach out directly to support

1) The only real prerequisite is Node.js, everything else will automatically be handled by this package. It really is as simple as [our start page]( says.
2) This is running bitcoind v0.11.1, and no slow RPC calls anymore :)
3) Theoretically sure, but I'm not at all qualified to answer that.
@_date: 2015-10-22 20:05:23
It does run it, but more or less as a library. Also the guy you are replying to is one of the Bitcore developers ;)

Hey, sorry about this. [Rackspace had an outage]( which caused parts or our Copay infrastructure to go down. This meant some users were getting errors as their requests were being routed to unreachable hosts. Things seem to be coming back online now, so let us know if you continue to see issues.

Hey Eric, I'm not on the team that worked on this, but as I understand it the binaries are just a nicety so that people don't have compile from source. The source of the patch itself can be found [here]( 
Binaries will be distributed with releases, but if you want to try compiling from source I believe that the master branch of the [bitcore-node]( component will try patch and build from source if you `git clone` &amp; `npm install`.
Does that answer your questions?
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:44:17
Should be resolved now, we're checking a few other things, but let us know if you see any other issues.
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:28:29
Just to let you know, we are aware and investigating.
