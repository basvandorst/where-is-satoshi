This isn't the same thing, because in that, the participants think their money is being invested, but it really is just being transferred to earlier members. Exponential growth is unsustainable, and eventually collapses. 
Here, if everyone just hodls and causes artificial value growth, it will create a bubble. The flow of money might seem the same as a pyramid scheme, but here, people know what they are buying and selling, and willing to accept the risks involved. And in a bubble, the first sellers win, and hodors tends to be the losers. It's the typical stages of a bubble, hodors think the price is going to keep going up, so they keep hodling even after the bubble bursts. 
So in the end, hodors tends to be the ones that lose money in a bubble situation, which is the one you're explaining. But if the price is going up because it truly becomes more valuable, instead of artificial value created by hodling, then the hodors will win in this situation.

Yes, exactly, it's currently speculative. You can only make money if you can sell it to someone willing to pay more than you paid.
Buffets type of investment is one that he doesn't have to sell, and it makes him money he can reinvest without having to sell your original investment.

To be honest, I don't think anyone really understands Bitcoin yet or what potential it beings yet.
However, as it stands now, Bitcoin does not meet the conditions for Buffet to invest in it yet. He does not believe in speculative investments. What he looks at is what his investment produces. Bitcoin currently doesn't produce anything yet. If he owns 1 btc, it doesn't make money, it doesn't make more btc, it doesn't make anything.

Even in your situation, it's still a speculative investment. Investing into any Fiat is speculative, same with gold. And gold is pretty universal.
