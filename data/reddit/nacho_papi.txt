Failed? It hasn't even started yet.

Yup, almost 17K again now.

So the US just keeps printing unlimited money, that seems like a huge problem. How can we utilize this if it is unlimited?

On another note, the Bitcoins seized from Silk Road (26,000 aprox) are now valued at $458.8 Billion. At the time they were valued at $3.6M. Just thought it was interesting.

Is there an exchange that *does* have Segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:51:50
Why force businesses not to screw the public over? Because they will if they're not forced to, that's why.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:38:43
Tattoo it on one of the butt cheeks, or both.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:58:51
Can it be used in the US?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:28:55
It has a nice ring to it.

How about, for example,if I buy a Lambo with bitcoin directly, without cashing out first? Not that I can buy one or anything, just for conversation's sake. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:17:41
None with GDAX

He saw a story on Fox News that said differently, probably.

Force them not to screw their customers, that's what Net Neutrality is about. Forcing them not to play favoritisms to whoever pays them the most. Force them to treat all data the same, the same way that you don't get charged extra if you have a phone provider and call someone from another provider. Force them not to throttle the speeds you already pay for after going past an arbitrary limit that they impose.

For some reason it doesn't let me log in from my phone app. But I'm leaving Coinbase anyways.

What about the best crypto exchange that uses Segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:22:35
It's still his money and he's not doing anything illegal. It's none of their business. They might have had good intentions but they approached it entirely the wrong way. 
Edit: 


















@_date: 2017-12-28 19:39:01
If I'm not mistaken, I believe Bitwala from Germany supports Segwit.

Same here, and again at $11K, and again at $13K, and again at $15K. What really convinced me after lurking on for a while was [this graph]( from three years ago when posted it 17 days ago.

It would still take a few days to go from "bank account" to "funds available to buy btc", though, right?
Is there a step-by-step guide on how to do the wire and a buy?
