The address changes when the wallet detects that the current address has been used for receiving funds. Currently you will have to manually click on the refresh icon on the top right to fetch updates from the blockchain API, and if there's any incoming transaction, the wallet should know to move on to the next address. But if you send funds, the wallet should know immediately to show a new receiving address.

Where did you get that quote? Would that be for hive osx? For hive web and ios, transaction fees are estimated based on the size of the transactions the same way it is currently done in bitcoin-qt. Most of the time you'd see 0.0001 BTC as I expect most transactions created with hive wallet to be under 1KB. Whether to allow users to set the fee or not, that's a feature that's still being debated. Related discussion:

Hive web doesn't facilitate/allow passphrase recovery (it's impossible since we don't store that on our server). It does allow for pin reset, as long as you have your 12-word passphrase. Hive osx isn't an HD wallet, yet. It is definitely on the roadmap:
