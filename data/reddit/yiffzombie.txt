And it's value is 100% in control of market manipulators. 
What an amazing revolution.

LOL. Why on earth would anyone put money into something that everyone has watched lose almost 80% of its value in less than a year?

Because Bitcoin didn't get over-inflated in late 2017.


Because Tether printing money to produce pumps wasn't rigged.

I'll take my funnies over you looking for bagholders.

TIL that electricity predates paper currency. Who knew?

Almost no one, with good reason, is willing to buy secondhand fans and PSUs from miners. I wouldn't buy parts from a mining rig even at an 80% discount.

God, I can't even tell if people are just memeing, or are actually this delusional.

Honeymoon of taking a city bus to a Motel 6 and splitting a Little Caesar's Hot 'n' Ready?

Assuming bitcoin is relatively distributed worldwide, it isn't even a tenth of 5%. The percentage of btc addresses to world population is 0.31%

Yep. People aren't coming back to crypto. It had its boom because it finally got mainstream attention, and people wanted to get rich quick. Then some people did get rich quick and sold at ATH. By now, the main thing the mainstream knows about crypto is that it crashed and burned, and people aren't coming back to invest in something they know as being volatile, at best, or a scam, at worst.

That's hard times, daddy.

I would say putting all on green would be more apt.

Tell me about all the times that someone had their wallet compromised and they got their coins back. I've had my debit card stolen and within 24 hours my bank had my funds back in my account.

I think you misspelled "retarded".

Whatever you need to tell yourself to keep up your sunk cost fallacy.

Tell me about the other times it has trended downward for 12 months straight while losing 80%+ of its value.
