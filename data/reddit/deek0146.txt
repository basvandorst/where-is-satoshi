However its perfectly feasable for a company to build a credit card or paypal like system on top of bitcoin.

Wow, a reasonable and clearheaded debate on @_date: 2014-08-17 22:16:34
Saying a computer is turing complete is not a practical assumption, its a theoretical model that does not fit here.

Whats the label on the verticle axis somebody?
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:36:35
No I can see the difference in time period but the values around that time aren't even close.

Well "colloquially" the answer is still no, because it has limited memory and nowhere to page to, and so little processing power the process would be terminated before it finished execution.

There was a guy in the 80s, can't remember his name, who wanted to sell an encryption protocol abroad but couldn't because of this classification.
He got around it by putting the source code in a book and selling that book, since they're protected under the US constitution.

Why does it look so different from this chart?

This article is true, for the moment. Widespread bitcoin adoption will never happen through first world countries, it will begin with countries whose economy's have collapsed like Brazil and Greece, then maybe, after it spreads, will Americans begin to properly consider it.

Having trust in an unregulated free market is a good way to get scammed.

Well the elections coming up, so he's fear mongering for votes.

The general public explosion of interest in bitcoin has passed and its time for it to continue its slow and quiet growth.

The massive price was probably due to wild speculation. Now that the hype is dying its going to fall back into the realm of being used for illegal drugs, hobbyists and anarcho-capitalists, which is quite a small market of people compared to the hype bubble that it is still crashing from.

Well I would hope the sellers at least encrypt their data if they do save it.

Oh gift cards, that makes sense. Explains why they looks so snazzy too.

I sit in my room programming video games almost as much as I sit playing them. I would very much like to make shitloads of money from it one day.

"BitTorrent" is a protocol, of which there are millions of instances. You can't destroy a protocol, only individual systems. Bitcoin is one single system, and there are plenty of ways it could be targeted aside from a Ddos attack (which wouldn't cost more than $100B anyway); legislation, politics, threats of incarceration and/or warfare.

Because you were under the age of 20 (I assume). Us adults are too old and stupid to adapt to new technology apparantly.

I don't understand the point? You can't use these as currency since even though they say 10mBtc or w/e on them, there's no guarantee that someone hasn't taken the money out of that wallet.

Am I in ?
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:25:04
Wow, thank you, how did I not know?!
@_date: 2013-03-22 10:04:47
Yes, in fact that's what I was saying.
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:16:35
I still don't get it.
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:03:00
Yes. I was being sarcastic because you misunderstood my first post and tried to explain something that I already knew to me.
