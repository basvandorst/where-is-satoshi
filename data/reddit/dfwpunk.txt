If Bitcoin wants to be taken seriously as a currency it has got to stop allowing itself to be dominated by speculators.

Just reading this make me laugh out loud at my desk.

The uptick in activity is all people hoping for tips.
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:17:49
Am I the only one who thinks a lot of bitcoin stories only get posted in hopes of getting tips?

The main use right now is by far as an "investment", not as a currency. That is a simple fact. And contrary to what people want to claim, that is not a good way to get it adopted, and has not been the reality of any currencies currently in use.

I agree with Ukraine. They are at war with Russia. Russian oligarchs are moving in to bitcoin because of sanctions. I certainly wouldn't help strengthen the market were I Ukrainian.

It's unfortunate you are not among them.

ITT: People posting and hoping for tips (like every other Bitcoin thread lately).

You do realize that type of behavior shows a level of obsession that simply cements the impression of your mental instability.

Do you feel that the need for specialized mining hardware is detrimental to the movement?
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:02:35
Doesn't seem to.

Right now it's a gamble more than anything.

Unfortunately what so many bitcoiners fail to grasp is that, while the idea is understandable, the level of scarcity is far too high to make bitcoin a long term solution ans a currency alternative. It is inherently extremely deflationary, and it seems far too many believe the exact opposite (and have posted as much in this thread).
This is why it has been so heavily bought by speculators who, by definition, have no intention of holding long term. They understand there is only one way it can end and it does not involve widespread adaptation of bitcoin as a currency.

To say dominated ignores reality. All currencies have a primary function of facilitating trade. That is not the reality with Bitcoin.
Of course the whole system is doomed anyway by the overly aggressive inherent scarcity which will lead to excessive inflation.

Why does your statement completely ignore the possibility of Civil Rehabilitation, which we now know is the outcome, and which does not mean you will get all of those bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:26:39
Not if they don't want to.

If your posts are having an impact on the market then the Bitcoin market is in serious trouble.
