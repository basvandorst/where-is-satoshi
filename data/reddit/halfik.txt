if you don't know how to put own LN node on mainnet, means you shoudn't have one. there are reason you won' be able to google any instructions.

Nope. We are on bear market atm - long term.
First major resitant is around $7500. If we drop below 9k it wont stop till $7.5k
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:25:24
It is way more scalable than increasing block size. Current version of LN that is tested on main net is not the final one. If this solution works its going to be developed over many next years. To scale bitcoin you need multiple scaling solution both on chain and off chain. Only if you combine them you can get good network capacity.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:25:35
You can use this: 
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:47:01
dont use it on mainnet.
not with out official rc.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:14:32
You have to rememer hat LN is using onion routing. Each transacion have 20 hops (always). Only sender and reciver are able to determine who sent transaction and who is going to recive it. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:34:30
You can mesure how secure they are by amount of $ in system.
And its hard to take your hashing power and attack other blokchain becuase you waiste electricity, you dont mine coine you can get money for instead you mine token that value is just destroyed. There is really nothing to gain.

By deafault core nodes keep transacions in mempool for 2 weeks i think. They drop transacions earlier only if they reach max mempool size in MB or if owner changed this in configuration file.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:30:15
It all comes to implementation. Current versions are alpha. So yes, they have and use only 1 private key. But there is no reason for future versions to operate with multiple keys.

I don't know. Thing is scaling will never end. Look at the internet. We are still scaling it.
With LN we should be able to handle i think 3-5k tps this year, maybe more. Blockchains are not easy to scale.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:32:25
Dude has no clue about value behind bitcoin.
Its not good to work as p2p payment system. Blockchains scale really bad. But LN or other L2 solutions should help with that.
But its great as trustless system that allows 2  entities to exchange value with out anyone permission. There was no other system like that before bitcoin.

There is nothing to gain with 51% attack. You can do damage but you won't earn much. Anyone who has amount of power to perform 51% attack prefer to use this hashing power for mining. Its way more profitable than attacking network.

@_date: 2018-01-09 21:33:12
And you are going to see it till if wont be droped by nodes used by blockchain. Thing is that transaction can be droped out of network. But it is not that easy. Each node have own configuration. So some nodes can drop if but other will still keep it it mempool.

if you know how to run ln on mainnetwork then its your call. 
thing is there should be no instructions for average crypto user how to do that.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:20:14
PoW. They have to pay electricity bills so then cant keep all btc they mine. They are forced to sell them on market.
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:03:33
If you dont see a problem with fact that single entity decides consensus, then i cant help you. You dont need crypto for that. You already have banks.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:11:01
Guys, you won't see hubs on LN. Reason is simple. Each node has to keep private key online. Noone is going to risk to many btcs just to get some penies from being a hub.
Main LN resouce are locked BTCs. So if you wan't to be a HUB, you have to commit a lot of BTC. If you do that, you can expect that a lot of poeple will try to hack your machine to get into private key. Risk like this has no sense at all.
And amount of channel you can have depeneds on BTC you have on node. So it is not possible for anyone who want to connect to node A. Node A need to have some free BTCs to be able to connect with you. It is how its works on testnet atm. You just can't connect to any node you want. They reject connections.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:23:23
Fact that you come here with this means you shoudnt put any $ into cryptos. If you can't sleep because you lost 70%+ means it is not for you.
You have 2 options:
1. take a lose, get back $ you can get and never again get into crypto with that amount of money
2. sell all shitcoins, get btc and wait another 1-2 years to get your $ and probably more - but expect you will have to take more % lose in short term and be able to sleep with that.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:54:08
I dont know. Nobody knows. Thing is that blokchains can't scale well. To make more transactions on chain by just increasing block size, you sacrifice decentralization. Anything you do to scale blokchains is some kind of trade off.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:58:42
First: Both parties have signed transacion, so any of them can broadcast it to bitcoin network at any time.
Second: with additional fee i think its going to be possible to allow other nodes in LN network to keep your transaction (and broadcast when other party is trying to broadcast older version of this transacion, to punish bad behavior). So maybe there will be a way to use this mechanism, dunno.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:22:12
they have 0 or close to 0 utility value.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:36:22
Sure there are. Question is: are you going to earn more $ by mining or by shorting? Imho hard to calculate. But maybe it would be profitable? Dunno. If it can be profitable we gona see this sooner or later.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:53:48
You don' have to. LN does it for you. It is looking for route itself. If route can be found, you are ok. If not, you might have to connect to recipient node or any node that is connected to him.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:05:31
Its already implemented. Node can autocnnect to network. Dunno how he chosed nodes he connect to.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:44:34
it doesnt look like a transaction id. in any case can find it in block explorer.

@_date: 2018-01-22 13:12:52
You can connect to specific node if you and that node have some free btc (not lokec on LN channles already).
But if node you wan't to connect with, have all BTCs locked up on channel, you just cant connect to it. You have to use network and its routing. Whole network is P2P.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:23:43
You know u can place a custom fee?
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:39:11
If you don't have debet then i think there are 2 options: stay with btc or if you have enough btc, put 20-40% into real estate and keep rest in BTC. If you don't have that amount sit with btc and wait till you have enough to do that :) BTC + real esate (passive income) is the way to go imho.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:29:03
Can you pace transaction id?
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:04:30
Probably second transaction will be mined first becuase of fee. First one at this point is goint to be rejected by network as double spending.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:55:52
Are you serious? You think people have 1gbps bandwidths?
Herer are some data i just googled:
 Singapore comes out on top (98.5Mbits/s), followed by Hong Kong (92.6Mbits/s), South Korea (79Mbits/s), Kuwait (76.5Mbits/s) and Romania (71.6Mbits/s). The UK comes 27th (51.6Mbits/s) and the US 22nd (53.3Mbits/s).

Yes they are. Problem is that coinbaise and othe big companies that uses most of block space didn't adopt segwit and are overpaying fees + some miners are minin low fee transactions insted of hi fees.

No, companies i mention have nothing to do with bitcoin mining atm. But you already have some gpu designed for mining delivered by 2 comapnies?
There are at least 2 really big companies working on own asics designed for bitcoin mining. Google for it. Both announced this information this year.
Bigger bitcoin is, bigger change that more big players will join the race. There is to much money to make. Simple as that. And fact is that there are only 4-5 companies that are capable for delivering &lt;10nm asics. Bitmain or any other china company have no technology to do that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:59:46

@_date: 2017-12-10 22:22:51
LN allows to send from A to B with out channel between them. LN will find a route to make this transaction happen using other channel open on the network.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:15:02
Bcash is fork of bitcoin supported by some scammers and chinese miners. Bitcoin is a decentralized system. Most of network value comes from fact that no single entity or group of entites can controll or change bitcoin.
On other hand you have bcash that is controlled by few entities. It has supporters because a lot of propaganda was happening since like 2015 and still going on. Newbies that dosen't understand bitcoin technology can be really easy manipulated with this propaganda.
Bitcoin goal is to stay decentralized and provide scaling solution that wont compromise network decentralization.
Bcash is going to incrase block size limit and they are ok with fact, that on one point they will end with network with maybe dozen nodes located in big data centers, controlled by few big companies. In short they want paypal 2.0
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:10:36
It uses all this energy by design. More energy you need, more costly is if you try to cheat network and more costly it is if you want try to attack network.
Other networks are going to have same problem as bitcoin. They are not there yet, becuase there is not demends for them.
LN should be realeased in 2018, so we should get fast and cheap transacions back. We have to wait till that and live with this fees.

In short LN moves bitcoin transacions from on chain, to off chain. When you open channel, you lock x amount of btc on blockchain. From that point you can trasanct on LN up to x amount of bitcoin. Each trasaction between you and me is a bitcoin multisig transacion - we both sign it and have copy of it. When we next time make a trasacion, we create a new trasancion thats is signed by both of us. And because it is signed by me and you, we can send it to bitcoin network any time we want (we close channel).
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:59:36

@_date: 2017-12-09 09:50:45
it is only temporary solution.
in future they are going to move LN to L3 and put L2 between LN and bitcoin network. That new L2 will provide find route service. I asume this route nodes are going to require some better computers but still.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:45:59
Maths seems ok. Thing is 1Mb block is not forever. We have to deploy LN, collect data and then decide what block size we need and start building consensus around hard fork. Plus there are more on chain scaling improvments comming like schnorr signatures.

Thing is that devs delivered temporary solution - segwit. Problem is that companies that uses most of block spaces didn't modified own system to use this feature.

Its another way to attack bitcoin. After this we gona see more, way more ways they gona try to prevent people thinking about buying it.

@_date: 2017-08-11 09:22:04
Sure you can start any amount of nodes you want, but you won't get controll of existing nodes this way. Network will get more centralized but still stays pretty decetralized because of nodes you don't control.
Miner nodes are important but they can't be only power that decide what kind of software all users are running. Thats why NYA can't be resepected even if we like 2Mb block size increase. This hard fork should imho be delayd so core devs can use it to change more things with it, not just the block size by 1Mb.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:59:50
I don't see how it would be possible, but i might be wrong.

It needs to connect to full bitcoin node.
And what i does? It allows electrum clients (wallets) to get informations about transactions. Electrum wallets doesn't get this informations from blockchain directly, they get them from electrum servers (and server get them from btc nodes).
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:13:17

@_date: 2017-08-21 15:05:38
Not true.
If LN devs can deliver that was promised 50k tps is just a start. 
You can't use visa or mc to make smart contracts between different system (software). With LN you are going to be able write systems that relay on Bitcoin smart contracts.
Plus with LN you should have damn fast transactions (up to couple seconds) and cheap.

@_date: 2017-08-16 19:06:02
No. At least not a day after activation,
As far as i remember it will take around 6 months for most of network to move to segwit. It will give us a more space in block and cheaper transaction costs due to their smaller size. But first people will have to move their coins to segwit addresses. And still we don't know how much this will help.
Untill we get LN or any other 2nd layer scaling solution we have to deal with current situation. All possible 1st layer solution are just going to move this problem maybe couple months forward.

Well i would like to use Bitcoin as daily p2p paymet system. But reality is i can't do that.
Thing is there are no shortcuts. All this devs are working with new technology and are working on kind of solutions that none before created. Its not that easy. Probably more $ and more resources would help them to bring solutions to market faster, but well... people seems to prefer create another fork and use thier money to fight all other forks.
And agree you won't get 100% consensus because some times best technical solutions aren't good for some of the companies. And some solutions that can be bring to protocol faster and are good for companies, are bad from technical point of view.
In my opinion there is no way to keep everyone on 1 chain.

Here my opinion about situation we all are here now:
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:34:24
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:24:00
Note really. Network accepts longes valid chain.
For 1x valid chain is one that has blocks &lt;= 1MB.
For 2x valid chain would be with blocks &lt;= 2MB.
So 1x don't see 2x chain as valid, but 2x see 1x chain as valid. So if one point in time 1x become longer, 2x will switch to it.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:02:41

can you perform 1mln tps on his blokchain? no you don't.
if you want p2p global payment system you have to aim at 1mln+ tps and it can't be done on blokchain.
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:32:18
Exchanges are problem here. They don't pay this fees with own money, so they don't care.
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:33:15
All SPV wallets (that don't work direcly with blokchains) use and needs own servers. What this servers do? In short they have a lot of indexes they keep building based on whats in blokchain and that they use to find transactions informations when client ask. It's just faster to do that way.

In short, with out wipeout protectiion there is risk that at one point in future legacy chain can get longer than the other chain. And if that happen, both networks (they see and use same transacions couse there is no way to say to wich network transacion should belong) will use longer chain. So you start with chain A and B. B is longer, but at some point in future A gets longer (have more blocks). So all B nodes will switch t o A chain. All transacion that were made on B from split till that moment - are wipe out, like they never happend.
And this can happen only on splited chain. Becase legacy chains won't see splited chain transacions as valid (in example they have 2MB of size, while legacy accptes only max 1MB). While splited chain see 1MB and 2MB as valid. Splited chain don't have a way to tell that transacion belong to legacy, not to him. Thats why there is risk of wipe out. Splited chain can in future see legacy chain (that is valid for him) as longer chain. And network always use longest chain as long as chain is ok with network rules.

Someone probably send you this btc by mistake. Send it back?:P
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:42:19
not really. block size is still max 1MB. thats why we should use "block weight" now instead of "block size".
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:04:41
And core team exists because all this people and some point decided they want to contribute to project. Anyone with skill can just join them and be part of that team. Thing is none of them can do protocol changes by himself. There is a process that new idea has to go through. To put is simple: technocracy. 
Then market and companies around has to belive that core team made good changes and upgrade softoware.
Problem is that was is good for users and protocol itself won't be always good for all companies making money of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:50:04
There is one simple reason why we can't support 2x even if we like idea of having 2Mb blocks. Decision was made behind closed doors by companies that make money on Bitcoin. No one invited core devs. Bitcoin won't be a Bitcoin if companies can change rules with out consensus. If we let guys in suits to decide what and when change in protocol its game over. So doesn't matter if they bring interesting ideas or not. There are rules. If any1 want to change anything in protocs, first step is BIP, then if accepeted - implementation, code review and proper testing. There is no way around it.
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:15:12
it's not about 1 or 2MB.
problem is how this changes were made.
for many years there was a way anyone could propose a change into protocol - BIPs. there is aa process how to propose and add changes to protocol.
thing is NYA and 2x is just a try to skip all of this.
and thats biggest issue with 2x.

Ln is one of layer 2 solutions. Bitcoin is layer 1. To scale whole network you add layer 2, check how network will work after and if needed you scale layer 1. If layer 1 will slow down layer 2, we gona have to find more ways to scale layer 1. If we won't have any other options (we still have), then we gona have to increase block size. But only then.

Yes, we we can use hubs to make payments between 2 sides with out opening direct channel. Thing is that network will try to find routes we can use to make payment and wallets probably will allow us to chose route.

Paper wallets are safe becouse you never use them. There is no chance that any hacker, mylware or anything can steal your private keys, becouse they are only on paper wallet as long as you dont use it.
Thats why its considered best option to move all coins to another paper waller or hardware wallet when you used any electronic device so move coins from older paper wallet. You could move just some of them and leave rest on that paper wallet but you never can be sure that at the moment you gave access to private keys to desktop or mobile wallet, you didn't gave access to any1 else.
Conclusion: make another paper wallet if you compromised old private key, Its just in case.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:17:22
Block can't be bigger than 1MB.
You can only see more transacions packed into 1MB blocked.
SW doesn't increase block size, it allows to decrease transaction size and that allows to pack more transactions into block. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:31:08
Yea i know. Im just gona do it to check what you are saying. So i can wait days for that transaction to confirm :)
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:46:37
If we gona have banking crisis like in 2008 or similar, then yes. This year all cryptos went crazy mainly becasue japan adoption and korea capital control. So we dont even need a financial system crisis. Any kind of problems in any of bigger (by gdp) countries in the world, will bring more people and money to cryptos.
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:42:50
There is no way to scale Bitcoin to visa or mastercard level by increasing block size only. You can do that but price is centralized system - mean it wont be Bitcoin any more.
Thats why there are few technologies under development that will allow to scale off chain.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:44:08
It's change because Bitcoin HD wallets are capable to generate tons of addresses (private + public key) that are derived from seed phrase (math behind). And it is consider more secure to not use same adres more than once - privacy reasons (hard to figure out who and how much btc have, what transactions made and so on).
And yes public key = address.

how much are you willing to pay? simple as that.
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:12:21
if you have 12 words writen down you are fine. most of mobile and desktop wallets will let you to get access to your coins by using this 12 words.
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:21:29
Always check fees in places like this: 
Look the amount of pending transaction and remember that every 10min +-2k transactions make to the block. Its pretty easy to estimate how much you have to pay to get into block in like &lt;30min or in 2-3h or more.

If you need more bitcoin and you can mine it, you just mine it.

If you want to get yours bcc coins, then yes. Move your btc to another wallet, wait for 2-3 confirmations. Install on another machine or in virtual box electron cash client, seed it and you are ready to send bcc to exchange. Imporant thing is that if you install electron wallet it will take and use ur electrum walllets data. So do in in virtual box or another computer.

LN will allow to make transactions off chain.
You need 1 transaction on blockchain to start channel. From that point you can make any amount of transactions with founds you have on channel - all off chain. And second blockchain transaction will happen when you close channel. It will settle (on blockchain) the result of all transactions you made on chanel. 
And becasue any one can be a LN node operator, fees should be really low (competition).

segwit doesn't increase block size. block size remains 1MB.

@_date: 2017-08-18 17:54:38
no bch or any other blokchain that isnt centralized wont work well. they work as long as there is not enough people using them. but as soon as people start using all the block space, you are going to see fees going up and up.

This isn't a problem. Bitcoin will survive this no matter what. Can lose his crown in cryptospace becase of possible mess, but will survive. It is only truly decentralized blokchain solution out there, that is designed to store and move value over Internet. All other blokchains are less secure or a way more centralized (and we already have those, they are called banks).

To get paper wallet you can use: 
There is link at the bottom that will allow you to download that page. Download it, run on computer that has no internet access (or in virtual box), generate paper wallet and print it in like 3 copies and keep them in 3 different locations.

No you can mine only Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash any maybe Bitcoin Dark and other Bitcoin fork. Other blokchains use different prof of work algoritms or hashing fuckions. 
If you want to mine specific alt google if you need asic or gpu to mine it.
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:25:14
Mempoll is full of transactions. There was over 40k today waiting. Now its like 33k. Pirce is moving fast, so people are trying to sell or buy.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:22:27

probably because they dont have to handle that amount of transactions. dont you think?
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:22:51
At this point it is not technicaly possible. As long as we dont have working solution that will able to make daily cheap transacions with bitcoin or any other crypto, we gona stay where we are. But if any of this developers working out there, can bring good, working solution that will allow for 1mln + transactions per second or even more, then yes - Bitcoin will eat fiat, beacse its better form of money at this point.
What Bitcoin is doing right know is eating piece by piece all fiat currencies. Problem is, we are full atm and can't eat much more.

If you are here for money, they you can buy, sell and keep anything your want. But if you are here for idea that Bitcoin is, there is no reason to keep altcoin like BCH, where 2 miners mine 90%+ of block and 1 guy is going to decide how protocol is supose to be changed. BCH is everything Bitcoin never supose to be.

Each new invominh transaction increases sizes of transacion when you decide that you want to move coins.
More in transaction on address you have, bigger transaction u will generate with this address.

Question is how many people want to trust their money to the blockchain, that consensus rules can be changed any time by group of none technical CEOs or in future if needed by any larger government or even single entity with enough power to do sue? 
Lets be serious here. Even if we think that this change would be nice, we can't allow for it. And if companies decide to keep it going, we can't use their chain. Because it will prove than Bitcoin can by changed with out consesus and its going to be the end.

use wallet that enables custom fees - electrum in example.
also consider waiting for weekend - fees are way way lower.
and yes amount of inputs makes your transacion bigger, thats why its so expensive with auto fees.
if you need address that will be used to recive a lot of transactions, use segwit address - it will let you move this coins cheaper, when you later decide to do it.

It can. But Satoshi made a decision that Bitcoin won't do all things Etherum can, because it would made whole system overcomplecated. Bitcoin was design to be 1 thing and do 1 thing - peer to peer payment system. And even being only this its really complicated technology and will be more complicated over time.

When you buy coffe merchant will see this transaction almost instant. And this money are his from this point. He will get Bitcoins as soon as he close channel.
You don't need to close channel. It works on smart contracts. It means that when you send money to someone, only that person can claim this Bitcoins when channel gets closed. It is kinda IOU, where when you close channel each party gets Bitcoins.
When you make a transaction and someone in network who supose to relay it to next node - turn off his node, well.. then your money are temporary locked. I think it will depends on wallets implementation for how long they are locked. But you will get them back and you are only person that can take them.

Miners were blocking segwit (solution came from core devs) for like a year, arguing they don't like it and they want bigger blocks (1Mb curently).
So core devs and miners coudn't agree on how Bitcoin should be devloped for like a 2 years.
In May this years users deployed code (UASF) that was going to activate segwit with 1st August 2017, leaving no options for miners to block it.
Miners and people from biggest companies making money ouf of Bitcoin (like Bitpay) aranged a meeting in New York.
Core devs weren't invited.
In New York they came to agreemnt that they will activate segwit and 3 months later increase block size from 1Mb to 2Mb. They fork off from Bitcoin Core and made changes that will automaticly increase block size 3 months after segwit activates.
They used this software to lock segwit (will activate in couple day). Same code is going to change block size to 2Mb in 3 months.
Problem is most of network use Core Devs code, that doesn't have this 1Mb to 2Mb block size change.
So in 3 months if companies and miners that sign on NY agreement won't pull off or Core devs won't decide they are going to add 2Mb change to their code OR node owners won't make updates - network will split.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:00:35
BIP - Bitcoin improvment proposal.
Each time anyone want to change anything in protocol, he has to start with BIP (a document). BIP is review and discussed. If people agree it makes seens to make this improvment to Bitcoin, then code is writen and review. When devs decide code looks good, its been tested on Bitcoin testnet. If tests are ok, then you get improvment with next version of Bitcoin Core client.
Fork is when changes developers made are incompatibile with older version of software and network still uses older version. Network splits into two chains that have common history but from time of fork - they are seperate chains (networks).
Segwit is complicated to explain in couple words. But from user point of view it will allow all of us to make cheaper transactions. There are more important changes that segwit brings to table, but its a lot of tech reading.
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:55:54

Some people don't understad why BCH isn't a good solution and are betting their money on it.

With segwit we should reach much more transacions per block than we currenly have.
Currenly we process over 260k transacions per day.
That gives us around 1.8mln per week and 7.8 mln transacions per month.
If we assume that average user will open and close channel each week, we should be able to handle 900k users. If we asume people keep channel open for a month, we should handle 3.9 mln of users.
With 1MB no segwit blocks. With full segwit block we can double this numbers.
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:55:49

Because its best money we people ever invented. And what is funny, we can make it even better money. And at some point it will be best, more stable store of value.
What will cause a price rise? Adoption. There will be only 21 mln coins. Supply and demand. Adoption means demand grown and supply is going to be lower over time. Thats why as long as technology isn't broken, price will rise.

It's just another layer above Bitcoin and other segwit blokchains.
Thing is that for micropayments LN is much, much better system by design. Blokchains just can't scale themselfs to the point where everyone can use them for daily transaciotns.
There is a risk that we are going to end with dozens of big LN hubs. But with proper wallet user should be able to chose:
1. do i want to make this transacion on blokchain or with LN?
2. if with LN, do i want you route X or Y
If big companies will use thier hubs to try controler network, smaller nodes (probably same people that have btc full nodes now) can close channels with this hubs and won't relay any transacions to them. I think that if we will get into any kind of problems with hubs, we will just ban them from network.
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:27:08
Used by whom? My node doesn't use it. I can bet that 90-99% of network nodes doesn't use it.
Its retarded idea to hard fork just to increase block size by 1Mb. There is plenty of stuff waiting to be added to protocol with hard fork. When devs decide to hard fork, they will change more than just block size. They didn't decide to hard fork for last 9years for good reason.

You can open channel any time you want and keep it open as long as you want. You can have in example 4 open channels with different amount of mBTC there. Yes this cash in lock in there but thats the way it supose to work.

@_date: 2017-08-15 09:24:57
There are to many people using Bitcoin right now. You have only 1Mb of space every 10min, so people bid to get with their transacions into this space. Sometimes you can get there really cheap, sometimes you have pay way much more. Depends on how many people are trying to do the same. And as long as we don't have lighting network or other 2nd layer scalling solution it won't change.

Trezor is a hardware wallet. What it means, all your private keys are derived from seed (more or less) and kept on trezor. Each time you have transaction on desktop or mobile with trezor, trasnacion is sent to device. Device signs transacion and sent it back to wallet, so wallet can send it to the network. Your private keys are never exposed.

To make consensus rules changes you need to do it proper way. With proper bip, disuccions and so on.
Bitcoin can not be change by any single entity or group of entites if there is no full consensus about this changes. This idea is just deadly to Bitcoin. Idea that group of people with money or power can change Bitcoin should never exists. But it is here and imho it is another kind of attack.
I mean i hate current situation we are atm. Fees are just a joke. But i think is temporary and solutions are coming. We just have to wait.

Well thats not true. You can check steemit. Pretty good use case for this technology.
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:07:24
Nope. Becase lot of us are here for long term. A lot of people are here since 2010, 2011, 2012. They are used to fud, good news, bad news, price going up and down. Nothing new for them. It all already happen and will happen again.

Can't you just write down seeds and use them on another machine with different wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:29:51
It means that each time you fork off from existing blokchain, you have to implement wipeout protection if you don't want to risk that your chain will be wipe out in future.
Legacy chain will always survive. You need only 1 computer that will mine it and it will survive. Look at ethereum. Legacy chain is there. And it has nothing to do with hasing power left on legacy chain. Thing is that there is no way to delete it. You would have to delete all compies of this chain on all computers on Earth.

they can hide it in "advaced options" + display warning if fee seems to low. simple solution.

You are welcome :)
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:07:35
I don't see link proving that what they write is true.
And when BU and all big blockers were screaming that segwit is bad, they never could explain on technical level why it is bad solution. So if you can't propose better solution then stfu. And they never did.

LN nodes can allow to swap tokens between chains.
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:29:52
move your coins from that address. more spam transacions you get there more it will cost you to move your coins later.
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:03:39
It doesn't work like that in case of Bitcoin.
Anyone can make BIP, code it and make a pull request.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:18:20
It will be noticable very soon. And in up to 6months we should see near 100% segwit transacions.

@_date: 2017-11-10 18:29:53
No he is playing a game. They will focus now or pumping and promoting BCH with hope that one day they can overtake BTC. It is only way they can get rid off core.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:33:38
Probably roger and miners are buying that shit.
Most of china based hashing power already switched 100% to mine BCH. They are going pump in, keep mining and wait for more morons to keep that price pumped up so they can start calling it bictoin. I asume they are also hard dumping their BTC now.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:13:17
This are only full nodes. Todal node count is like 900k

nowhere. but you can check trade volumes by markets:
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:33:30
Alts don't drop because of forks. They drop bause there were entry points of newbies to crypto. As soon as they realise there is no crypto if bitcoin fail, they move to BTC. At least this is part of the story here.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:50:06
You have to wait till mempool get cleared out a little bit. Number of transacions in mp is going down with each next block, but slowly. We still have like 100k unconfirmet transacions (was almost 200k).
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:24:09
We can mesure BTC value in chickens or cows. Fiats are just simpler lol.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:41:54
Paper don't last forever. You can use solutions like this when you will have more than few bucks in Bitcoin: 
Also remember when you get trezor: write down seeds and first thing to do is to reset it and restore from this seeds to be sure you didn't do a mistake while writing it down.

@_date: 2017-11-03 18:06:53
Why would you anyone who understand what cryptos are want to use token that is controller by entity or group of entites (miners in case of bch). Plus they are going to scale it on chain. At some point bch will become paypal 2.0 (&lt;100 nodes running in big data centers, controller by miners). Why whould anyone want to use this over current paypal?
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:47:08
Learn. Read, watch. Adreas is a good source: 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:36:46
1. If fork happens you get tokens on both sides
2. As long as one of chains wont win, both networks will be slow, so fees will really high as well as confirmation times.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:07:31
It was the reason satoshi decided to not add more op codes that would allow smartc contracts like eth in bitcoin: it was making technology to complicated.

Yea but it shows what we see here. Simple pump before fork :) Same thing happend with BCH, they pump in on asian exhanges. Easy to notice price manipulations when you look at markets they are using ;)
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:36:47
It would be to problematic and to risky for him. So its not gona happend.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:15:34
There is no chance. Bitcoin was designed that way. As long as people prefer Bitcoin it can not be taken over. Miners can't mine token that market don't want to buy. They have loans on their hardware and electricity bills to pay. They will follow the market. And if you look and features they are like 10-15% of BTC. So i woudn't bet on 2x token.

@_date: 2017-11-05 14:35:33
If you keep your private coins you are ok.
And what will happen - mess as long as one of the chains won't win over other. Network will be slow for sure if fork happens. If miners decide to go with 2x, then all is in hands of users. If users decide to dump btc and buy 2x, 2x is winner. If users decide to dump 2x and buy BTC, BTC is a winner and miners will be forced to swtich back and mine BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:44:46
If you want to invest amount that you won't need in next 2-3 years and won't be woried if it will go down to $3-4k then go for it.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:41:32
Miners moved to mine BCH becouse it just adjusted difficulty down. So we have now like 3 blocks per hour = mempoll have now like 50k+ transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:00:14
Problem is not the solution. Problem is how it was decided and was going to be delivered. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:01:30
it is about institutional money. they will stabilize the price.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:55:29
Even if they do, now they need to sell only small % of their coins to have $0 invested.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:14:45
Blocksteam was co-founded by Adam Back, Gregory Maxwell and some other guys. Adam Back is a guy behind proof or work that satoshi used in bitcoin. Gregory Maxwell is contributor in Bitcoin/Core project.

if fork happens we gona see big dip. and if it will cause a mess that last 2+ weeks, we can see begning of beark market.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:34:23
Same way you do with all other wallets. You move your BTC to a new wallet. Then you import private key from old wallet to BCH wallet and dump this on exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:10:43
You are wrong. B2x has no value. Bitcoin have no value if any single or multiple entities can force on whole network new consensus rules. It has value bacuse there is no way this can be done. Thats why 2x will fail and you should dump it for cash or btc or eth.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:37:00
It will sufffer. For start we gona see way longer block times so mempolls are going to grow fast.
Thing is that if the market don't want 2x miners cant mine it on a lose for a long time.
I think this split is going to be a mess for couple weeks. And BTC will suffer from it but there is noting we can do about it. We can just dump 2x coins as soon as possible to kill other chains as fast as possible.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:48:22
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:01:43
Still dosen't change a fact that 2x has no value. It is a crap. Horse crap.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:03:03
If 20k is not much for you,then go for it. If it larger amount of money for you, dont invest all of it.
Plus invest half of you are planing now and use other half to buy the dips.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:58:48
You can't have "cheap enough" transactions on chain. Blockchains dosen't scale well. Idea to keep daily transaction on chain is simple bad by design. You have to constantly increase block size limit. And that leads to network centralization due to cost of running node.
Network fees on chain are anit spam mechanism. Imagine how many companies could find a way to utilize block space for their benefits if it was free or very cheap. Companies that dosen't give a f... about bitcoin and its users. We can already see how coinbasie or bitpay are doing that. They don't give a sh.. that they are overpaying network fees while using most of each and every block space.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:56:34
This fork is different. There are whales on both sides. This is not a group of guys forking off because they want to use different rules. This is a hostile takeover. If it happens there will be blood on market.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:36:37
It will. When we gona see Bitcoin features on market, soon after we should see ETFs that are based on this features that are regulated.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:56:33
Most of this pumps happens on asian exchanges if you didn't notice. Look at BCH:  
Mosly in korea. Same is with 2x and other pump and dump cryptos and icos.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:35:14
No it is about what Bitcoin is all about. For you it is just a change to get some additional money. So you are in wrong place here.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:01:13
Also take a look on volume on hitbtc: 
&lt;$1mln to move price up 6% in 24h ;) You can't trust this data out there.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:25:45
Yea just noticed that only &lt;10sat/b transacions are out there.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:39:46
If it was segwit transaction you would proably already have confirmation, but it is nonsegwit so the fee is not that high when it comes to transacion size.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:39:31
lol no. do you know devs working on it? who are they? don't invest into blockchain technology before you check devs behind it. and they shoudn't be on payroll. there are only few blokchains that have proper devs teams behind and bch is not one of them.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:21:41
Becasuse it is not bitcoin core that is making changes to consensus rules. So job is always on side of dudes that decided they want to fork off and change this rules. If bitcoin core decides to changes this rules, they will have to add replay protection to version that is not compatible with older version of protocol.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:45:05
lol no
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:22:30
Eeach node in LN has going to define own fees. And because anyone can be a node, we are going to see a lot of competition in fee market there. So fees are going to be damn low.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:28:29
Wait untill situation clears out. By the end of month we should have all the answers.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:44:27
Seems like f2pool and some other pools lost sigificant % of their hash power. If i had to bet i think they are moving out of china step by step. To much money invested and would be to risky to stay in China.

@_date: 2017-11-05 17:33:36
Did you write down seed that electrum gave you? If not, then you have to create a wallet again and write down seed. Seed is your access to private key in case you hd will go down or anything like that.
If you want to use Bitcoin as a way to save money, you are doing just fine. Each time you have some free money, put % of them into BTC and keep on trezor. Don't panic if price drops 30-40% (it will happen sooner or later). Use your BTC when you gona need this money.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:53:40
There is no safe way to do this. One of core devs is working on tool that will enable to split coins. Also i belive hd wallets will realse proper tools soon after fork, but probably way to late (people will dump this shit in first 24h). And keeping coins on exchanges during fork means you dont own them during that time.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:31:23
Mempoll is 80k transacions now.
We have 2 blocks per hour. Almost all china based pools switched all their hashing power to BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:51:37
No its not. They just dont have users.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:15:03

They are keep priting it, look: 
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:35:28
Don't. We are rlly hight right know. Dunno how high we can go from here. If you realy want to buy some know, use 30-50% of cash you have, keep rest cash and buy more BTC when it will drop 30-40% so you will average your price.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:28:33
No other exchange uses token they controll instead of fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:02:37
If you don't get it, you don't get it. Go and educate yourself about how bitcoin, open source and trustles system works.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:34:10
At one point market will tell them "i check". And they will learn.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:18:24
No. They could use op codes that are not in bitcoin but they manage to work around this.
They have problem with routing. It stil not solved. They just work around it by keeping map of whole network on each node. But this is not a solution and will work fine only up to 10k nodes (or sth like this).
But we probably gona see first alpha or beta working on main net by the end of this year.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:05:21
Lol. Google for lightning network project and read code if you want. There are 3 or 4 of them implementing same technology.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:31:09
Because it should. It went to fast to high and now morket is checking where is the bottom. It is normal behavior of market. After market discovers where the bottom is you can expect price to stop and afer some time start moving up again.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:45:44
It is good for network and for you. You have cheaper fees and network has less data to pack into blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:49:10

@_date: 2017-11-11 22:47:17

Power is distributed. Thats what makes bitcoin special and gives it value. There are many entiteis having some power, but not enugh to change consensus rules. Miners have some, devs have some, companies have some and users using full node wallets have some.

Blockstream and other companies can earn some $ is they manage to build important hubs that most of network decides to use.

Lol no.
Look at BCH. How many comapnies controll it? How many devs works on it? Bitcoin has no value if any amount of companies can controll it. It was value because noone is in controll so there is no way single enitity or group of them can change consensus rules. If you have entities in controll they can change rules any time they want or when powerful gov force them to do so. Plus it is f... easy to ddos 100 nodes. Its not so easy when you have 10k of node across globe.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:29:52
It went down after 2x was canceled probably because lot of people moved back to alt coins. Now it is going down and bch because of miners and guys behind bch. Last 24h couple big mining pools swtiched all their hashing power to BCH.

if miners decide to attack bitcoin im pretty sure users would backup devs on consensus algo change.

Are you using some older version of ln node? Anyway there is an error when i try to pay invoice using lnd 0.4: 
@_date: 2018-03-21 11:50:45

It can. Had many tranascion with fee 0.5sat/b confirmed in 5-30min during last 2weeks
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:12:38
Strange. I had this error before and asked on lnd github. Answer i got is that some older versions of ln soft are cousing this problem.
Can you try pay my invoice?
its 1 sat invoice, but check it first ;p

Mempool is empty from time to time. Ath there is no reason to pay more that 1 sat/b even it there are transactions in mempool. My transactions during last 2 weeks all were with 1sat/b fees and were confirmed in 3min - 90min.
@_date: 2018-03-22 07:58:20
LN alone wont solve scaling problem. Block size increase will happen. Thing is with out colleection data from LNit would be hard to estimate how much bigger blocks are big enough. Plus LN in still beta. Give it 5 more years and it should be way more amazing :)
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:14:25
dosent matter. you would have to cenralized network as cost. centralized bitcoin would be usless.
@_date: 2018-03-20 10:43:14
No you can't put all your btc into ln. There is hard coded limit on single ln channel (dunno how much with current version of software). Devs limited capacity of channels so people won't lose much money in case of bugs.
LN is designed for micro payments. There is no reason to use LN over normal bitcoin transacion if you wan't to transfer more than lets say $100-500. Thing is there is no reason to use LN when transacion fees are as low as they are now. But when they start going up again we have option to start doing micro transacions in LN.
And yes you have to pay normal fee when you open and close channel, but thats it. LN transaction cost are super low. It depends on how many hops you have on your route and how much fee each node on that route want, but atm most of nodes takes 1satoshi for routing your transaction. So event with 20 hops it will be 20sat per tranascion in most  cases.
So thing is that in next 2 years we should have wallets for BTC that allows mainnet and ln transacions where user don't even see if transacion he is performing is LN or mainnet. But as for now we should keep some btc on LN in case we gona need to make a payment and mainet fees are to high for micropayment.

A and B can close channels with out other side. But there it will take 144 blocks atm. Its time given to other side to broadcast own closing transacion or penalty transaction in case other side is trying to cheat. But bottom is you dont need other side to close channel.
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:31:49
From what i undestand router will track all channels that failed multiple payments tries in 60sec  and wont use them in future.

But there is no reason to perfrom lets say 1BTC  transaction on LN while it cost 1sat/b on mainet. LN is still in development and untested technology. We don't know all the bugs and possible attack vectors. From other hand we know bitcoin network is secure.

There are some hard coded btc nodes in bitcoin core code.
Each new node starts asking them abouut data. After you get data about network your node connect to couple other nodes (dunno how it is decided).
Each time any of nodes you are connected to gets new transaction it broadcast it to you and all other conneted nodes. Same thing with your node. Each time you get new transaction, you broadacast that information to all nodes you are connected with.
What is impressive is fact that each new transaction is broadcasted to whole network in way less than 1sec if i remember data correctly.
@_date: 2017-09-03 12:10:12
Months i think.
Last week they made first payment with LN on LTC main net. Plus last year team behind LN was saying they will deliver working product in 6 months after segwit activation.
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:09:55
We all should switch to segwit.
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:10:36
Only problem with segwit addressed right now it, that a lot of wallets validate them as incorrect, so we have to wait for software updates. But there are no problems with sending coins beetween legacy and segwit.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:48:55
segwit makes your transaction smaller. you pay same sat/b cost. just total cost in smaller because transction is smaller. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:07:01
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:00:47
you should use segwit address for this kind of stuff.
if you have a lot of incoming transactions, use segwit address.
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:10:19
You can create a timelock transaction. Here is more info:

Lapp is any aplication using ln. So its layer above ln :)
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:00:20
during weekends there is always less trafic on network. you can do wire transfer to exchnange, so people dont buy that mauch during weekends, so we have less transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:48:10
Everyone know this was an attack and probably jihan was behind it. Thing is what changes can be made into protocol to make this kind of attacks very very expensive, even for miners.
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:04:43
Still you overpaid. 1sat/b would work. Thing is this wont last forever. With next bull run problem of expensive fees is going to come back.
Ps. You shoudn't link any bitcoin transaction to yourself. There are companies and probably gov agencies that are monitoring twitter, redditd and so on and linking all this transaction with data they already have. Privacy man. don't do that anymore.

Miner don't decide about fees. Market does. There 1Mb of space every 10min and people bid to get into this or any next one.
BCH has lower fees because they have way less users trying to make transaction. In 2014 BTC also had less users, so less demand on block space = lower fees.

How do you want to increase block size if you have no data that you can base on new size? First all optimization have to be made when in comes to how much we can compress block data, then we need to collect data from LN working on mainnet. With out this its stupid to estimate how much bigger block is needed.

He is not wrong.
There are 2 solutions for blockchains when it comes how to scale them:

2. centralize layer 1 (paypal 2.0)

maybe or maybe not.
even if ln will be centralized bitcoin still will be decetralized.
if you chose to increase block size limit, you end up with centralized network. i chose the first option where i have decentralized bitcoin and maybe centralized layer 2 (and its maybe).

Its true. When you make LN payment in reality you and other side are just making normal bitcoin transasction - signed by both parties. Thing is that this transaction isn't broadcastet to bitcoin network.
So to sign this transaction your node needs access to PK. 
As for now if you don't feel safe with this, encrypt wallet. Ln node will ask you to decrypt that wallet each time you run it. So you can start your node when you need to make a payment and stop after. Or you can just keep your node private (netowork wont see your ip, only nodes you are connected with).
Im pretty sure that someone very clever will come up with amazing solution to this problem. Cryptospace is one big amazing thing full of amazing solutions :)
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:36:47
If node goes down channels become inactive but arent closed. Inactive channels cant be used to route payent obs. So if you are making payment, other route will be used. Even now we can get list of possible routes and use specific one for payment. So we dont have route our payments through nooded we dont like for some reason

We can't move all trafic off chain and leave 1MB chain. More transacions we will have offchain, more transaction we are going to generate to mainchain.

so yea, it affects all bitcoin users and time is ticking. there are only 2 ways now:
miner activate segwit before 1st august
or we are going to see how uasf works.
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:48:47
Only long term solution is segwit that will allow lighting network and  other offchain solutions to be deployd. 
Onchain scaling won't work on long term, just becouse we would have to pay the price that would litteraly kill all ideas behind Bitcoin: centralization.
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:12:09
no it can't.
most of altcoins use same blockchain solution as bitcoin. they will have same scaling problems. other, that have different blokchain solutions will have different problems.
but no matter what you do, you just can't scale this technology using only block size increase.
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:06:50
No one ever said its impossible. I its.
Core team just know what they are doing. You can't risk so many changes in protocol in such short period of time.
Segwit will allow offchain solutions, but it dosen't change fact, that sooner or later we will have to increase main chain block limit.
Only way (that will work), when it comes to scale bitcoin and keep it decentralized is offchain solutions for paymerns, and mainchain block for settlements.
Thing is first we have to deploy segwit, then deploy and test some offchain solutions. After we will have tested, working offchains solution we will have to increase mainchain block size. Thats it.
Any good software engineer won't risk to many new features deployd in same time. And im think here about any normal software, not bitcoin with over $30 billions of peoples money.

@_date: 2017-05-30 06:41:57
No they are not. I'm a software engineer myself. And with my 10+ years of experience in my opinion core deves are making right decisions here. If i would be on their place i would make same decisions when it comes to segwit first block size increase later. It just how you build now just a good software but anything. Layer after layer. Smalls steps are best aproach if you won't wana see your product faill again and again.
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:12:47
It was cheap.
But now we have a way more users and transacions.
Devs figure out how to scale protocol and wrote code, but we can't deploy it. Mechanism that was used previously to deploy code, didn't work this time. Chinise miners are blocking it. Thats why community is trying USAF for BIP-138 (changes that will allow bitcoin to deploy solutions that will handle current and future traffic).
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:05:46
No. August 1st we are going to see if bitcoin works or not.
Because if miners alone can decide what protocol is and what it is not, then we failed.
We need BIP-148 usaf to show everyone that bitcoin can resist this kind of attacks and there is no way to take it over.

All the problems you see now here, you will see on any other crypto when they get scale of bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-05-31 21:10:25
transactions cost far more than $1.
you are going to pay $1-2 for small transacion.
if you have are doing any bigger transacion (more inputs or outputs) then sky is the limit. $1-2 isn't cheap, but think about $20-50 or more per transaction.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:15:32
It droped becouse people recognized that price is damn high and its time to take profits before it will go down again. Simple as that. lower price is just an opportunity for more people to buy cheaper coins.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:19:09
In case of chain split, yes. Becouse in that case we will have 2 seperate bitcoins. So the price will also drop for sure.
But chain split shoudn't happend. Core devs are doing their best job to not let it happen - its one of reasons changes are coming so slowly. And hard fork !== chain split. Chain split means that hard fork went bad. 
But for normal use this only means that you have you coins on both chains and both are worth less (hard to say how much less than they were worht before split).
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:47:46
I don't agree. Most users don't know how fast and expensive is option let's say "fast". Wallets need better ui for fees that will show what you see in 21.co fees in example. I mean: pay x to get confirmation in 10-30min or pay 1/4x to get conformation in 120-360min.
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:30:09
Yea market will adjust. Problem is that protocol developers are engineers. So they won't take any risk when it comes to future improvments. And as far as i know, never before in human history we were developing this kind of application they way we are. So we don't know best way to do it. Specialy when it comes to deployment. 
It would be much easier for developers to make decisions about futures and deploments if they had information if users what future or not.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:06:44
If you wat to have one, just buy one. Don't ask people what they would do. It's yours money we are talking about. Just answer yourself one question: why you want bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-06-18 09:02:22
There is no way to avoid this level of centralization. We could use some kind of dynamic PoW, but it wont change that much on long run.
Our only problem here is that we don't have a good way to deploy protocol code changes. 
Imho w should use PoS to vote on deployd code activation/block. It is pretty obvious that people holding coins in most case scenarios would do what is best for protocol. And i don't see why we coudn't have this kind of activation process build in and tested in near future.
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:05:21

And we want segwit becouse its good piece of code that allows to pack up more transaction in 1MB block but what is more imporatant it allows for off chain solutions to be tested and deployed.  Offchain solution + future block increase will allow bitcoin to scale from current 5tps to way way more.
And imho bitmain is blocking segwitnes only becouse they want to take controll over protocol development. They pretty much controll mining equipment production. With ability to controll how protocol is changed they pretty much will controll bitcoin.

Segwit itself isn't a scalling solution.
Segwit simply let us test and deploy 2nd layer solutions.
And we will have to increase block size. No doubt. But we can't tell how much bigger block we need, with out deploying 2nd layer solutions first. We could increase it to 2MB now, but if after testing 2nd layer solutions we will estimate that it's simple not enough to allow bitcoin to scale to lets say visa level, we gona have to hard fork again. And each hard fork is a risk of chain split. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:35:44
transacion did't happen till its confirmed by network.
transacions are keep by nodes in mempools, but not forever. 
so yes, transacion can be eventually droped.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:03:36
which part?
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:25:53
ofc i don't belive that because it's not about segwit.
bitmain is playing bigger game here. they simple wan't to take controll over bitcoin development process.  Classic, BU and all this stuff happend only becouse they can't controll development and with out that, they don't controll protocol.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:05:55
You probable want to know what will happens in case when hard fork ends with chain split? In this case you are going to have your coins on both chains.
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:11:04
no it can't. not sure of this but i belive miners take transacions from own nodes that are 100% sync with netowork (you cant mine next block with out some data from previous one), meaning they included last block found. in this case your transacion ist in mempool any more its already in blockchain, so there is no risk that someone will include it in next block.

We went form 230k to 55k with backlog but fees are now over 1mBTC. There is something wrong with wallets, becouse while backlog is getting smaller, fees are growing each day.
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:41:26
supply and demand. we have only 1MB space for transacions in each block and demand (number of transactions) is growing, so prices are higher and higher. 
when demand drops (happends in example during weekends), fee is also droping.
plus you paid $13 becouse of size of trasnacton. protocol dosen't care if you want send $1 or $1mln. only thing that matters is how much space in 1MB block your trasaction is going to use. 
Here is math you can use to calculate the size of transacion: 
inputs*148 + outputs*34 + 10 plus or minus 'in'
and current fees levels you can find here:

@_date: 2017-06-16 11:27:58
In our case it's blockchain for bitcoin purpose only. And we don't want to store on it some other applications data. Only way to prevent that are fees. It's also a reason why we need a block size cap on main chain. Fees have to prevent people from storing personal data on chain. Problem is we need to keep the low enought so people can use Bitcoin and in same time high enought to keep people from using blockchain as personal database.
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:19:00
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:08:51
You undestand you can't increase block size forever if you wan't keep bitcoin decentralized? And that you can't scale it by incrasing that size? Not to the point where everyone on planet could use it day by day.
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:05:42
no its not. and bitcoin isn't ready for anypayments. with out future scaling on and off chain solutions bitcoin can work only as settlement layer.

We can't tell "how much" is enough. We don't know this, because we don't know how much scalling we are going to get with lighting network and all other layer2 solutions. With information how much tps we can get with all this solutions we can estimate how much bigger block will allow to scale protocol in future only with 2nd layer solutions, so we don't have to hard fork for block size increase every 6 months.
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:54:22
Thing is it's not the same. Apllying changes that doesn't have enought support is risky. It's better to avoid rik if we can do it. Atm we don't know how to mesure what participants of ecosystem want.

They can do shit. To fire someone, first you have to hire him. 
We should have PoW changed version of bitcoin ready just in case this morons decide tp hard fork and attack other chain.

Run BIP148. Miners will run Segwith2x code for sure.
But what most of users do probably depends of core team. If core team decide to merge segwit2x into core - im fine with it, gona run that core realse. But i doubt it. They didn't sign NYA, noone ask them for opinion. If they merge segwit2x into core just to avoid chain split in future imho it can ends with more code they will have to merge and they woudn't normaly do, just to avoid every next code that chinise miner want to run. It's not a solution imho.
Im staying with core team. I read about core developers and know they are the best guys out there for the job,i trust them with my own money.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:06:46
If they screw up, they are going to lose money. Users are running core code so its not our problem.
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:49:03
No they wont. Onlt case you would see $250 is bitcoin failed and there is no way to save it, then you will see $250 and 0 soon after. But in normal case scenario i doubt we gona see $1000 ever again.
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:51:07
You undestand that to scale bitcoin you need to scale both layers? But you can't increase block size limit if you don't know how much big increase is needed. You can't know this if you didn't collect data from layer 2.
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:44:46
Edit your post. Don't write in public how many BTC you have. In time they are going to be worth more, so more hackers would be interested to find out who you are and how to get their hand on this coins.

They are trying but do they? No they dont and they wont.
Apps worth millions? So they are earn millions? No they dont. They dont earn a shit. Maybe except gamling applications.

Bitcoin value comes from protocol been up and runing for last 8 years. Where we all know what rules are and pretty much everyone are at this point sure its not that easy to change them. We know we wont have more than 21mln coins and that there will be no bailouts becouse someone f... up code. Where from gold value comes? Its same with Bitcoin at this point. 
Ethereum supose to be decentralized appliaction platorm but i haven't seen a single app i would use. Only milions of $ thrown into companies that have nothing more than white paper or alpha version in best.

It can't go up forever, can it ? :)
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:09:30
Each and every blokchain solution have to chose max 2 of 3:
- decentralization
- speed (tps)
- security (computing power)
You can't have all 3 when doing all transaction on blockchain. And becouse for bitcoin key features are security and decentralization, we don't have speed. But we can get this by using 2nd layer solutions - that will do some tradeoffs (again 2 of 3).
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:27:30
If you have to ask, you shouldn't buy it.
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:51:29
you have to download wallet (application). in case of BTC if you want desktop wallet you can use:
or mycelium if you want mobile wallet: 
you can read more about wallet: 
just remember that wallets gives you access to private key, that allows to send you bitcoins/ethers. if someone gets access to this key, he/she gets access to your coins. 
can't help with etherum but im sure you can  google for proper wallet.
ps. never keep your coin on exchanges. you don't have keys to your coins, so they aren't yours. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:01:54
satoshi never solved scaling problem.
it was one of first weaknesses pointed out.
fact is that if you want to have decentralized and secure blokchain technology, then you won't have many tps with out 2nd or even 3rd layer solutions.
there are tradeoffs to be made when you design a solution. and becouse in case of bitcoin security and decetralization are most important features, we have to solve scaling problems by adding 2nd layer solusionts to protocol.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:09:33
If poeple move to another coin, fees will drop.
Im not saying fees are ok right now. They arent. But protocol is working fine.
Fees are needed to prevent using blockchain as private database for other applications. Mechanism work fine. We just need some scalling solutions thats all.
@_date: 2018-12-01 13:21:44
Depends why you want to own bitcoin now.
If you want to have access to own wealth that noone can touch then having bitcoin is always good option.
If you want just to make money, then you are looking for time to buy in when btc is not hyped like last year. You are looking for beark market times. Times like now. But you cant time market. Noone can. So we dont know if 6k was good time to buy, or now is or tommorow. We just know that this is the time, but dunno about exact point in time.

We don't have any evidence of that. But it doesn't matter.
Fact is development and mining have to be separate. Someone controlling mining equipment production and development process - controlls bitcoin pretty much.

Import private key (secret part) from paper wallet to any other wallet on your computer or phone.

You undestand there won't be more than 21mln of coins? You own 1+ coin becouse there is only couple mln of people having any. But if more people decide they want some, its going to be more and more expensive for them to collect coins, becouse supply is limited and decreases over time.
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:45:01
We need other cryptos. We can't test all new ideas on bitcoin, it's cheaper to test them on other blockchains.
Take a look etherum  - they are testing smart contract solutions, so every1 learns from this. We won't repeat their mistakes when we will implement smart contracts on top of bitcoin.

As i commented under original article, its damn bad. Anyone who read anything about technical aspects of LN would know this.

@_date: 2017-06-03 17:01:31
By lowering the size of single transacion that will effect in more transactions in single block (its technical thing if you want to read it).
But whats more important is that segwit will allow for lighting network and other offchain solutions to be deployed. Then yes, you will be able to perform transacions off main chain (with much lower fees).
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:30:56
you can lose backup with disc or any other storage you keep your backup on.
with my idea you can always recover what you lose. becouse there is an information in blockchain. we use bitcoins protocol to allow us recover what was lost. blockchain is safer place to storage informations than a disc.
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:50:55
We don't know and probably never know if bitmain is controller by chinese gov. It really doesn't matter. Fact is they are attacking bitcoin and trying to take over development process and protocol itself in process. Core devs conservatism is used agaist us. When (its not matter of if) bitcoin repel this attack i don't see any other option for anyone to attack protocol in near future.
@_date: 2017-06-03 16:56:01
when you are trading segwit coins for legacy coins it means we already had chain split.
chain splits aren't safe. we need way to deploy code with out risk of chain splits.
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:33:30
Should be distributed wallet or chain wallet :)
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:28:15
well, you have all informations about transactions in blockchain.
so you can verify if address (i call it wallet - but its not a client application i had on mind) is still active or not, just by checking last transaction date to or from that address.
change my A,B,C walllet - to A,B,C address and things should be simple from that point.
@_date: 2013-12-25 11:18:06
now you should fully understand why we need bitcoin. noone should be able to block access to our money.
