I agree: it is an attribute that bitcoin holds exclusively. However, the utility of this attribute is limited by bitcoin's ability to be translated into goods and services, which is currently the rub.
It's fine and good to get bitcoins past an authoritarian regime, but there remains the difficult task of doing anything useful with them without employing a channel that *is* (or can be) monitored closely.
It's my understanding that the philosophy behind bitcoin is related closely to what you've posited. So while your thought is not novel, that you arrived at it from first principles is encouraging insofar as others should be able to do the same, thereby increasing the number of potential inputs for bitcoin.
I would venture that the first real large-scale acceptance of bitcoin could come in a region that is possessing of a destabilized and highly inflationary fiat currency, but that's still going to take someone with a large and trustworthy base of goods/services taking a flier on the currency.

You're not thinking low level enough. This happens at the disk level, not the OS or file system level.
You don't have a file somewhere called OMGRANDOMDATAHAXX0RS, it's random data on the physical disk that is only usable when accessed via the encryption program.
At that level, random data can exist for reasons too numerous to list here.

I know and I'm saying why they mightn't want to adopt bitcoin for that purpose.
Part of balancing the play involves making sure that purchasable items are not too easily acquired, too powerful, etc. Because bitcoin is necessarily tied to fiat currency by virtue of its relative worthlessness in most economies, it's fluctuations would have undue effect on the play balance of a game using btc for its in-game currency.
As an example, the gun you bought last week for 2 bitcoins, or ~$20, is now nerfed because pirateat40 started paying out and the market crashes to $3:1btc.
A trivial example to be sure, but those are the kinds of things that can wreak havoc with play balance (and perceived value) in games of all types, not just mmos.
@_date: 2012-02-24 20:04:03
Absolutely there is a reason: Securely erasing a partition involves overwriting it with random data. Plausible deniability.
Further, you have to be a knucklehead to keep your encrypted drive/partition/disk on the same physical volume as your boot drive.
Best to use a removable media of some kind that is encrypted with true crypt.

That's not entirely accurate. Software like truecrypt creates a block of data that is indistinguishable from random data until a valid password is applied against it. It doesn't require it to be hidden inside another encrypted partition.

It doesn't matter whether it looks suspicious. It only matters that it is deniable that is encrypted.
Further, it's normal operating procedure for a lot of users and organizations to securely wipe partitions and drives that have been EOL'd. Secure deletion is widely used - it's not just for "shredding evidence". Besides, law enforcement doesn't often afford you the opportunity to attempt the deletion, secure or otherwise, of critical evidence.
Best practice for this type of encrypted volume is to have it on a separate physical drive from your boot volume, preferably detachable media. In those cases, it is perfectly reasonable to expect to encounter random data.
In any case, the mere appearance of impropriety ("Hey, why were you secure deleting things?") is not a valid basis for a search order from the court.
Hell, even the stock truecrypt random-data-in-a-file approach can be hidden amongst /dev/random dumps, though I wouldn't recommend that approach.
Pretty much the only completely undeniable encryption schemes are ones that:
1. Describe themselves with a header or a magic number
2. Are loaded from a bootloader in order to load an encrypted volume.
3. Are poorly written enough to not achieve sufficient entropy to be considered secure.
The people that have gotten into trouble are those who use an encrypted bootloader and have their entire boot volume encrypted. It's a plain giveaway.
Again, I wasn't suggesting that volume-within-a-volume is not a valid approach to plausible deniability. My only assertion was that it wasn't required for plausible deniability.
@_date: 2012-02-24 21:01:35
My goodness, just reading that comment makes my head hurt. I'd respond, but I know a boondoggle when I see one.
I guess my overall point is that *fishiness* isn't a legal criteria for a demand to produce a decryption key. If you're hiding a cache of dungeon midget porn from your wife, I guess that passing the smell test is important, but otherwise, just the appearance of impropriety isn't enough to satisfy the legal demands.
If your overall goal is to provide legal deniability, then a partition of random data will absolutely suffice. A court couldn't demand that you produce a key to a volume that they cannot prove is encrypted. It's like saying "The evidence that you smuggled a bomb is somewhere in the digits of pi. We demand that you provide us the range in which this evidence exists"
At any rate, I never said that the volume-within-a-volume scheme was incorrect, just that it isn't wholly true that it is the only way to plausible deniability vis-a-vis the parent topic - court ordered decryption.
