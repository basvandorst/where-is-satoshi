Simply by being able to move big quantities of bitcoin

Financial Institutions with a lot of capital power will have a major influence in the liquidity of the Bitcoin. The simple fact that our monetary system is dependable on physical assets and fiat money would let these big guys play around with the price of the bitcoin. Instituional control of the bitcoin market would be increasing at this level. 
This is not what the cryptographers and libertarians who initially worked on the creation of the bitcoin would like to see. Guys, we are just getting greedy with all these ETF's, while at the same time diverging from the original point of the bitcoin.  
To get back to my first point, if big players from TODAY get their hands deep enough into the bitcoin, all this will ever do is become a simple mean of cross-border transaction and deflationary store of value. 
The whole point today is that although it looks like it and the opportunity definitely is here, bitcoin is not a get-rich-scheme and was never intended to be.

Yeah but nodes don't really matter in decision taking do they ?

So we have more chance of getting BU?

Be careful if the price crashes by the time you try to sell it you might lose more than the taxes you would have paid. If you intend to hold it longer, then go for it.
