Things my cool poster ignores for $500 please.
What is parallel computation?

It's better there than here in Western Europe. I couldn't afford 100GB of traffic via LTE here in Germany. In Poland I get that for around 25 Euros pre-paid.

Give it a few decades and it should be pretty liveable there :)

Yes, that happens when you put someone who can't spell "computer" in charge over everything digital related.

Is this some elaborate joke I'm not getting?

Yes, that's pretty much how economy works: You take a bunch of stuff and add value to it. Then you sell for a markup.

Eh, you have to verify your bank account and shit. Too much hassle for 1mBTC.
Also the bank verification process is pretty sketchy (they want you to hand them your online banking credentials [pin/tan] so they can log into your online banking and issue a transfer of 14 EURO cents). I'm not too thrilled to give someone full control over my online banking account for $0.30 or whatever a 1mBTC currently is worth.

Don't bet on it. Here in Europe if someone writes "funny" stuff into the subject line of a wire transfer you can get your bank account suspended. I don't think it's too different in the land of the free. 
The same happens with PayPal.
Just don't be "funny" with payments.
