I assume you're talking about wallet.dat with the typical bitcoin-qt client. And I assume that you moved the coins to some more secure address(es).
If the program starts with no wallet.dat present, it will generate a new wallet.dat file with a pool of fresh addresses.
So it sounds like you just need to delete (or preferably rename) wallet.dat.

Maybe hoping for you to deposit more before they decided to sweep it?
I dunno. Based on the timing, that implies it was an offline attack based on guessing your username.
Blockchain.info works by having javascript in your web browser handle encryption/decryption.
With email-verification/2FA enabled, then you have to enter in an email code in order for your browser to even get the encrypted wallet file for your 15-char password to decrypt it.
If you did *not* enable the email-verification-on-login feature on blockchain.info, then all someone needs to access your encrypted wallet file is to guess your username.
Once they have the encrypted wallet file, then they can brute-force it offline.
However, 15 random chars might be sufficient safety though. Even if all lowercase, that's still 26^(15)= 1,677,259,342,285,725,925,376 possibilities. I'd optimistically expect a GPU farm to handle a couple billion/second, so that's still at least a 1,677,259,342-second (53 years) cracking time. (More experienced hackers pls check my math)

Another way to translate word phrases into private keys is  , which your husband may or may not have used. The main menu has a "passphrase" field that hashes arbitrary text into a private key, and there's also the "poetry" option in the Converter menu. (But it looks like the poetry conversion needs exactly 24 words to convert to full private key)
And by all means, don't trust random websites from redditors like me. If you're going to use brainwallet.org, then I'd only enter words into it after loading it on an offline computer out of paranoia.

Two weird tricks to a flat belly
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:45:16
**R**andom **N**umber **G**enerator.
Many random number generators use shortcuts such as applying arithmetic to the current timestamp in milliseconds. This is fine for things like games where predicting the values doesn't matter.
RNGs can be used to generate private keys and other encryption-related values. Usually the applications that need random values for security or encryption purposes use a stronger source of randomness, such as user mouse movement and even atmospheric noise and special hardware. The official QT client uses such randomness (provided by the operating system).
Brainwallet.org was using the simpler, more predictable type of "randomness" (in firefox and probably some other browsers), hence OP's problems. 
Sure-fire detection of it is difficult unless you know how to read the source code. 
A guaranteed safe (but inconvenient) alternative route is to use physical dice or coins and convert the rolls/flips into a 256-bit value manually, and use that as a private key.

Potential issues with reusing the same public key or address:
1. If ECDSA somehow gets cracked before SHA256 + RIPEMD160 hashing, then funds in any recycled addresses in danger, whereas funds in unspent addresses would be safe.
2. If the transaction-signing doesn't use a good source of randomness/entropy, then a private key could be deduced if its corresponding address has multiple outgoing transactions.
3. There's a slight loss of anonymity if you keep using the same address. (e.g. If you use the exact same address to give money to a friend and to donate to church and to donate to your favorite porn site)

Answering your follow-up question
Since you clarified that this is some exchange account, this is probably what happened (this is how most exchanges work):
The $2702.56 address was part of a large pool of dynamically-generated addresses that the exchange owns. It happened to pick that $2702.56 source address to process your withdrawal of $24.54. The other $2677.95 went to a newly-generated exchange-owned address to be later spent by some other arbitrary exchange customer.

Many explanations describe difficulty as "number of leading zeros", but it's actually a "is hash less than this target number" threshold.
[Here]( we can see the target going from 
If we ever reach the point where difficulty is so high (threshold is so low) that the lack of proportional granularity becomes an issue, then it probably means the current hash algorithm has somehow been cracked. e.g. a target of 1 implies that any hash value can be reverse-engineered within 10 minutes. That would probably have serious security implications outside the realm of bitcoin.

And these funds often put their money mostly into the huge companies like Apple, slightly helping them stay powerful. Another downside in my opinion.
I just think laypeople shouldn't be penalized for having simple savings.

Because you used a shitty clickbait title
@_date: 2014-06-27 05:24:56
We already know the randomness is fucked.
Probably due to incompetence rather than malice though.
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:13:03
His angle is that running executables from random sites is how people lose bitcoins.
Are you the kind of person that would open BritneySpears.nudes.jpg.vbs.scr without a second thought?
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:23:45
In theory, a known future event should already be factored into current prices.
In practice, people are dumb. So it could indeed be a big event.

running nodes at home is already infeasible due to many ISPs' data caps

"cyber attack from outside sex"???

A machine could be disconnected and still be vulnerable to a bad-entropy exploit present on the iso.

that's why I stopped using Gox when they started requiring DL info
@_date: 2015-04-02 14:48:36
They've had a fee-free promo period until now
@_date: 2015-09-30 23:17:33
but an unnecessary hassle if they have to be exercised
@_date: 2015-09-30 22:31:00
Why should a payment system require you to give up secrets with each transaction?
@_date: 2015-09-30 22:42:49
That's an independent debate.
The relevant fact is that public key encryption has existed for decades and banks still don't let us customers use it for identification/authorization.
It could have been integrated with traditional banking as a new type of transaction mechanism  years ago regardless of bitcoin's existence, but it hasn't. Instead we have "here's a secret number, make sure you never give it to anyone untrustworthy. also you have to give it to anyone you ever pay."
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:53:02
Yeah, I used them quite a bit in circa 2012 because gox was demanding driver's license info and I didn't trust the Karp' to keep it safe.

Do USD withdrawals work?
(I guess to find out, it would take a ~$20 fee and a week or so of waiting for the mailman)
@_date: 2015-10-15 22:56:55
Yeah sadly the other answers aren't addressing the repeated halving

I was critiquing credit/debit card numbers
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:54:28
Huh, I tried to log in for the first time in months and it's telling me "PASSWORD HAS INVALID CHARACTERS"
Oh well, good thing I have zero balance with them
@_date: 2015-03-17 04:01:15
Yeah I was greeted by unexpected 2FA back in july when I tried to log in to confirm that I indeed had a zero balance.
One support ticket later, they disabled 2FA for me. (For security, I was asked to "provide the date and exact amount of your last USD OR Bitcoin transfer"), which I had from emails.
@_date: 2015-10-01 15:50:01
oh you edited.
does chip and pin work for online transactions? can I buy a pokemon dildo from some shady japanese website and rest assured that no one stole the details to create more transactions?
also chip and pin seems to still be having a terrible rollout in the US.
@_date: 2015-03-04 22:06:10
Are you referring to that one bug that was discovered in 2010 where someone was able to use integer overflows to send 184 billion bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-10-20 19:01:45
So do you require verification for crypto-to-crypto these days?
(I haven't been able to log in and check since you disabled my account for 6 months inactivity and I can't remember what garbage I chose as security questions)
@_date: 2015-03-17 14:24:22
Did you reply using email or their ticket system?
I'm pretty sure I sent response via ticket system.

What if people want API access so their tradebot can autonomously yet legitimately transfer hundreds of BTC?
2-factor for allowing api/app access would have made sense here, where the email clearly spells out the permission details, including "you are granting this entity access to remove funds"
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:26:14
And here I always thought Satoshi envisioned nodes and mining being married based on this quote:
*"If you're sad about paying the fee, you could always turn the tables and run a node yourself and maybe someday rake in a 0.44 fee yourself."*

@_date: 2015-03-31 17:10:05
And what if the exchange is giving up information to the government about users' deposit addresses and withdrawal addresses?
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:37:25
Probably following the AskReddit style of not giving his own answer, since then a bunch of top comments would be responses to that and not answers themselves.

I've hated eth since DAO. They've made a *lot* of shitty centralized decisions IMHO, and the advertised features are unwarranted complexities.
But recently the bitcoin landscape is starting to seem even worse. Despite all of eth's shortcomings, at least it's damn usable with sub-dollar fees.
At this point I don't care how shitty the bitcoin bandaid is or whose solution it is, as long as something gets fixed soon and not merely promised as a magic lightning bullet to be implemented months or years away.
