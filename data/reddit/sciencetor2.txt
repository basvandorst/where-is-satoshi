Except BCH is mostly a shillcoin so don't buy it, and the Bitcoin devs are almost done with the lightning instant payment network which will make BTC fast an cheap enough for everyday transactions
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:03:52
Honestly there are some issues that need to be addressed, but I am confident they will be. But the other issue is that the previous guy's comment history shows he supports pushing BCH by "Stealing the Bitcoin name" and "a focus on marketing". Which is unacceptable shill behavior
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:57:03
It is a shillcoin. The people pushing for it are trying to trick people into thinking it's the main Bitcoin, and using incredibly shady PR tactics to do it. it doesn't solve the scaling problem, just postpones it while making it require better computers to mine and run a node, which further centralizes the system, that thing you claim not to want. And despite the theoretically possible need to have service providers for the lightning network to work, they don't control the money because it's still a cryptographically secure transfer, meaning they can't loan the money in the interim or hold it hostage. And anyone can be a channel provider. And finally your "original vision" is the  meaningless shill line because the original vision doesn't mean shit if it can't meet actual global market needs at scale.

No, he made the point that if Bitcoin is expensive and slow, people have the option to go elsewhere, to altcoins like ethereum and Litecoin, or even back to the central banks

Easy to get into, I have doubled my money since last month, though this is non-standard gains, and yes it is uncertain in the sense that nobody really knows where it's going, and we don't know which one of the cryptocurrencies will emerge Victorious, we are also betting that people will decide to go with a decentralized to currency they will own rather than the central banks in the far out future

It sounds like for this to work in the wild, there's gonna have to be area "supernodes" that have connections with all the major businesses, an we are right back to centralized banks, but with BTC

What was the public address btw? i can look up the transaction history for you to make sure its the right wallet and such

This seems to trade away convenience for lower cost... Essentially I have to buy what equates to a "gift card", with a 1 time purchasing fee, to a specific business to avoid block chain fees. While this does save me money if I do a lot of business with that 1 shop, it essentially means a certain, not insignificant, portion of my liquid funds are tied up in "coffee money" that can't be used for anything else without paying a "cancellation fee", and as the shop I can't access my paid money without closing all the gift card accounts and paying a fee

It's slooow, I've set these up as part of a research project (the actual project was an end-to-end encryption library but we had to support mesh) and the issue is that with mesh, you've gotta use hops through people's machines, and some of those machines are crappy, o it's very possible that the least number of hops is still very slow

Who is getting fucked over? Not the hodlers, they're protected. The panic sellers are being protected from themselves, and if they still want to panic sell after the price stabilizes they can do that with nothing harmed but a wait time, and in exchange they get to sell at value in stead of placing a sell order only to have the price enter an unrecoverable panic fueled feedback loop and be worth pennies before their order clears, possibly never to recover because faith in the market is irreparably damaged? Who is losing here? Other than some wall street short sellers who may have caused the crash for their own profit at the expense of everyone else's?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:28
makes sense, if I were shutting it down that's what I would be tempted do (no sense leaving unclaimed money lying around indefinitely) sorry to hear that though.

According to their API, they have added stubs for both buy AND sell operations. When the exchange thats so easy your grandma can use it, which controls a majority of the Bitcoin transactions in the US, and is currently the most downloaded app in the US, starts letting all those people buy into a "new" altcoin, that coin can't help but go up, at least in the short term
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:05:24
Probably a good idea, I sent some BTC as part of my Reddit secret Santa (inside a puzzle box, paper wallet with instructions) and as the giftee didn't mention the BTC (at current prices around $65) I'm wondering if I'm gonna get a call after the next jump asking if I have backups (I don't)
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:41:20
If you mine Bitcoin as an individual, you will not make money, as the electricity costs will outweigh your awarded Bitcoin for successfully mining a block, as the difficulty rating goes up as a function of time and we are pretty far into Bitcoin, it requires specialized hardware to not mine at a loss. On the investment note, it's like an investment in that you buy in, you own a portion, and the value changes, except you are actually buying a chunk of currency with a fixed number of 21million coins that will ever exist. If the world decides to use it as a currency, those coins are going to need a much higher value to represent all that wealth, resulting in currency deflation, rather than inflation which happens when more money is printed to represent the available wealth. If you are buying in to make money, rather than to spend now, you are essentially betting on all of those above things happening. If they do, you are rich, if they don't, you aren't.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:57:40
directly to coinbase no, but if that number in addition to the address is a private key, then essentially what you have is a "paper wallet" and you can set up a local wallet with that information to retrieve the coins, then send them to a coinbase wallet.

Right now doing transactions with them is straight up throwing $5-6 in the trash... So until we fix that, doing this is more likely to hurt Bitcoin than help it
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:36:10
Good thing too, it prevents major crashes if the price drops too sharply, and they control such a high percentage of the USD/BTC transaction market that it actually has the effect of freezing the actual price
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:08:58
Because their service is intentionally slowing down transactions and jacking up fees because they refuse to use a newer codebase. And it's making everything more expensive than it needs to be

I tried to buy a Bitcoin through Circle Pay at 800 but that was back when they were phasing it out, and I didn't have the time on my hands to set up a local wallet during an exam week, so I forgot about it

not quite... cryptos are a currency (a way to pay for services), the internet is a means of accessing services, if nobody used the internet, it wouldn't be valuable. if nobody used bitcoin, it wouldn't be valuable. in the same way if nobody offered goods/services through the internet, nobody would use it, making it useless. this didnt happen, because the internet was a better way. cryptos are the same in this respect, except the jury of the world is still out if its a better way, and since its a currency you have to exchange some other currency for it, or mine it (work for it).

i have several altcoins, but because i believe that the BCH guys are gonna pump the price of BCH temporarily when coinbase picks it up, and i know that this will force a temporary dip in BTC, if you are in the business of getting MORE BTC it might be prudent to buy BCH, ride the pump, then dump for BTC when BTC dips and hodl on for the recovery.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:47:35
It is only more efficient because less people are trading it. The Bitcoin network is under heavy load, with the main exchanges not implementing an optimization patch. If Bcash were under a similar load, it would have similar fees. But unlike Bcash, Bitcoin has large backers actively coming up with fixes and optimizations (segwit and the lightning network) to solve these problems. We are seeing a similar issue with the ETH blockchain as it gains users, and it is slowing down. As for the "true vision of Satoshi", that's a load of fiction and you know it. Satoshi wrote a white paper, he did not test his product at scale. When we did, it had some bugs, so in response, half the group went "SHUN THE NON-BELIEVERS" and the other half said "let's come up with some clever ways of avoiding this issue". That "true vision" BS shouldn't be a part of any argument. But despite this Roger Ver has launched a PR campaign to pump his fork of Bitcoin without any significant fixes other than increasing the block size to postpone the inevitable. He isn't doing this for you, he's doing this because he has a significant sum of money invested and the more he hypes his way, the richer he gets.

There's quantum communication, which is a different thing, and that's something the Chinese are currently testing with satellites. To the best of my knowledge that's dealing with individual photon based data transmission though, not quantum computers.

That's gonna break a lot of our last provably secure crypto algorithms but sure, "look forward". (No I don't mean they're magic, but RSA Asymmetric key exchange algorithm can be broken mathematically via an equation that only works in a quantum environment)

It has nothing to do with processing power. There's an equation to easily find the prime factors of arbitrarily large numbers in a quantum environment. It's called Shor's algorithm. But this has nothing to do with the leaks, and everything to do with quantum computing not being something to look forward to in terms of security. The security of the RSA key pairing algorithm comes from the inability to easily find the prime factors of an arbitrarily large binary number.

I feel like this is their way of preventing catastrophic crashes, just stop processing orders and claim tech issue until people cool off

Bitcoin is speculative right now. I am speculating that the price will go up. I know that it has to in order for it to be fully adopted, I know how an why it works, but I am speculating that enough people and companies will believe in a product that wants to compete eventually with Fiat, but in the short term needs to compete with PayPal and credit cards, a service that is cheaper(free to the consumer), easier, and universally loved, on the premise that it will get better in the future. That's speculation.
