Actually diamonds ARE fragile. They have high hardness but not toughness

They're still breathing. Have chances to survive. Services are running, no delistings and teams are not running away.
We are only at the beggining I assume.

My opinion - we are locked in $5200-$10000 before most alts will be done.

It's the decoupling and altcoin purge people so much waited for, I assume. Quite unpleasant for altcoiners, it appears to be. Not so frightening for btc-hodlers.
I wouldn't be disturbed if only I haven't 2/3 of my portfolio in alts.

Of course. BTC is money. Not some sacred religious symbol as some folks seem to think.

That bull run was much of a bubble scheme. It was fame and greed that was selling bitcoin and alts, not adoption or use-cases.
Next bull run should have more natural reasons. And market cap is still too divided between coins.

Hmm. Seems to me we'll eventually go down again... The bull run will start only when there'll be only 20-40 cryptocurrencies alive or even less.

And just why would they need?
BTC is decentralized by it's nature. It's actually the point. It wouldn't be a threat for any "them" if it had the leader or leading organization like Vitalik Buterin in ETH.
On the other hand the only reason to be afraid of Satoshi is that he is not needed in the system. Alive, dead - doesn't matter, the system is made, it works and it couldn't be stopped.
Killing is just unnecessary expense in this situation.

To send a message you need to do it loud. It's not a message when no one hears you.
But it's unlogical to send message this way while the victim is addressing the people. You'll just make a martyr.
So it's far more logical to dig (or make) some dirt on the person of interest, like with Assange.
Or, if you really want to send a message - start mass repressions against crytocurrency users.

The only problem is to get $1.6b... or at least $7.4m... What currency is not priority.

Funny thing, this time Ver isn't ultimate enemy. It's Craig fucking-not-Satoshi Wright. He said yesterday he'll sell his btc, dumping it, for fiat to buy hashpower he needs to fight for his version of BCH.
But Bitmain is on Ver's side, so Jihan Wu said he'll use hashpower that was used for mining BTC on BCH. Which will be bad too (at least he says so). There's also a rumor that Bitmain dumped a lot of BCH for BTC and then BTC for fiat.
These two morons started the shitshow. I'd say it's a safe bet that sooner or later Ver will crawl from the dumpster he hids in to make things even more complicated. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:49:22
Yep. Bitmain and Ver are for BCH ABC, Wright for BCH SV. As far as I know, ABC is a new version of BCH with reverse compatibility, advanced parallelization and performance, while SV has no compatibility with older versions, it also has 128 Mb block and implements four new opcodes.

Difficulty will drop down, so Bitcoin would work.   
But! Market will be very depressed, so it will take forever to rebuild even to 6k, I'm afraid.

Ha! Religious people are so naive! It's clear that there is no Satoshi! They can't prove his existence scientifically, they even have no idea if it is a guy, a girl or a group. Clearly such creature doesn't exist. Must be random code fragments evolution in primitive Web that created Bitcoin. Or aliens. /s
