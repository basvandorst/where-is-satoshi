Good for them!
I'm an amazon guy, and use it to order little home things all the time. I was about to buy a stupid shoe closet organizer thing on the site, when I saw a tweet about the Overstock Bitcoin love yesterday morning. 
I decided to use overstock instead. 
They successfully got me to register for their site. I'm highly likely to use them again because of how simple it was.

Usage of bitcoin helped lead to its adoption. Trading it for actual goods and services helped lead to more adoption back then, so it makes sense to be supportive. 
(At least I tell myself this because I've spent at least 10 coins years back on random items - which nowadays could buy me car! I could've held on, but I think these minor contributions helped increase the velocity of adoption, and helped increase the value.)

I read it. I still don't understand the Illinois connection. Illinois did not manipulate the currency supply. 


So Illinois is a state, and apart of the United States, but Illinois didn't directly manipulate the money supply. The Federal government - sure, but not the state level government. 
I'm a fan of crypto, fan of Illinois, and recognize the financial burden that this state has taken on - but I fail to see how bitcoin offers an immediate solution to this current issue...
