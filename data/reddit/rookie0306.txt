Look arround we are already at that point where a bunch of retards invest in stuff they have no idea, just in order to make FIAT money. and they make a lot of money! its  not that big as the dotcom bubble, but its still a bubble. dont get me wrong i believe in BTC, it is the future. but its still not strong enough to handle the weak hand guys, first major crash will destroy the local bubble.

i bought a considerable amount of ETH on august 4  and got out yesterday at 330$. i guess i was lucky hitting the spot. but o try to show you the bigger picture, its not wrong to minimize your risk by gettin your gains out once in a while. else the big guys are doing it for you.
i could also say there was no point for me in selling, as you say. Anyway i got out with a good sum of money, and you are in with bitcoins, which you believe are gonna be worth 100k. dont get me wrong, i think it is possible, but you should open your eyes on what happens right now and get at least your initial investment out.

why dont you like when i tell u i didnt hodl? you dont like it because you know me not hodling means less return for you. thats what happens all over the crypto community. the big guys with lots of money in crypto will never tell you to sell or get some of your gains out, because if they do, it means less money for them

slowly people start to miss the point of a decentralized currency. all i see is people fighting about transaction fees, time, blablabla. visa/bitcoin comparisons.
here is an article for you to refresh why youre into bitcoin. 
i know its for the dreamers, but arent we in bitcoin because we dream about a world where we control our currency on a more fundamental basis?
the real life usabilty is still important i know, but it is not a valid point of criticism for crypto.

exposed for beeing pathetic makes it even more pathetic ��

its a psychological effect. your subconscious is starting to trust less in bitcoin, so you notice more negative things about bitcoin. this scares me a little bit. its a vicious circle.

Slowly i get a feeling, big money is fcking with the HODLERs. perfect group to get exploited. In some way it ressembles to a religion. people believe, and buy bitcoin. bunch of smart rich guys pump the shit out of the cryptocurrencies, in order to attract more HODLERs then dump it on them every 1-2 weeks. those 10billion swings every week are crazy. the bitcoin dip today doesnt seem "organic" to me. thanks god i took my crypto gains out yesterday and transferred to Fiat. the big multibillion pumps the last few days got me nervous.
Those who scream HODL the loudest are those who want you to hodl so they can take your money.
Just my opinion guys.
Edit: probably im gettin back in crypto, its easy money. what im trying to say to the hodlers. stop being fcked over, get your gains out every noe and then.

lets say i have 300mio dollars. i pump the shit out of a coin. greedy cryptowannabe traders get all exited join the bull run. i get my 500mio out. 
these are those people who scream HODL the loudest, because hodling morons get dumped on.

stop shilling the new guys in crypto. they gonna scare out faster if they buy on top. noone wins.
 guys in crypto: dont buy while its shooting up. wait a little bit, buy when it drops

well then im an ignorant fuck an still saw reddit as the "nerd" forum. btw nerd was just a little bit exaggerated, to show my point i exptected tech affine users. well being tech affine an being desinformed it still possiboe though -.-

The way you see Bitcoin (big dollar/euro/whatever sign in front of your eyes)  is the absolutely wrong way. Its crazy i even have to explain it. first fucking article on google explains the basic bitcoin ideology.
And yes the bubble got created by people who see Bitcoin only as a way fo make easy fiat money.
Yeah the "rant" is a rhetorical device in order to get the attention and prove the point.
well the weak hands means cheap bitcoin after the crash, i cant complain.

 guy who thinks youll need to lquidate your bitcoins:
welcome to the period where bitcoin got overrun by a bunch of retards who have absolutely no idea what bitcoin is. "liquidate his bitcoins for fiat", really you fkin moron? you still understood nothing, even though youre on reddit gathering information? 
im just reading the comments here, and id really like to rip out my eyeballs.
reddit is a "nerd" forum where you should expect some sort of "technical understanding", still overrun by morons, you cannot tell mr this is not a big local bubble created by a bunch of retards.
