I like bitcoin and FAIR taxes.
Not like you have in the US :p
Where the rate scales downward the more you earn.

I doubt that,  things are usually not optimized, even though we have 'free market'.  A few years ago it was maybe not cost effective,  but today maybe. In the future most definitely.

lightning network is still decentralized, so I dont see what the problem with that is

it doesnt remove the div-cointainer :P
So you still have unused screen space that could have been used for chart.
I have a home made extension that removes that div :)

impossible to find the perfect entry points :p but good luck

Purely as a financial ROI investement, I think demand for bitcoin has the potential to grow immensely.
Although it could also crash, and fail.
So, yeah,

Normal ethereum users arent affected, only those involved in DAO

Yeah, but what you didn't 'put in' you have invested in some other currency that can also fall in value.

Im not saying the framework is in place yet, but look at storjcoin and gridcoin, p2p computing resources is interresting and might be able to compete with big bussiness. But whatever you just want to be negative.

im just saying amazon is expensive...
@_date: 2016-05-15 19:38:30
look at what they are charging per hour for a 4 gpu instance.
@_date: 2016-05-15 20:14:45
if i had limited requirements i would be paying too much on amazon
@_date: 2016-05-15 08:25:38
what are you trying to argue?
That we shouldnt try to sell computing power p2p, because amazon will always be better?

well they are currently being used to mine, so thats 100% load all the time.
But renting them out at amazon rate would give me more ROI than mining atm.
if it were the other way around, it would be profitable to rent amazon gpu power for mining, but it is not at all.

I dont think youve done proper research either I dont see any numbers.
@_date: 2016-05-15 21:33:40
 idiot
@_date: 2016-05-14 11:46:25
amazon is pretty expensive, I would rent out gpu power a lot cheaper than them.
