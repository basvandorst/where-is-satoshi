Sorry I misunderstood. I too made a lot with that pump, except I held a little too long and only got 70%.
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:58:15
Spread out over a couple of years that might just be pretty stable increase for crypto lately.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:31:31
You did that to yourself. Don't blame the seller...

Hey, just wanted to say I got it to work by re-installing/updating classic multibit! Then it said checked by 3 peers, shortly after, checked by 4. Then it went to my other wallet which I'll be using from now on. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-06-11 17:45:12
Why even have accounts at all for a simple game?
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:41:37
Hey, just wanted to say I got it to work by re-installing/updating classic multibit! It was actually that easy. Thanks for your help!

I did uninstall it before installing the new version of classic multibit. I think I then just used my old wallet files to import those in the freshly installed version.
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:43:50
Thanks for your effort, I got it to work by uninstalling and reinstalling the newest version of multibit classic. Now I'll send it to my wallet on multibit HD.
@_date: 2015-12-15 19:29:59
I have a backup on 2 other places, I guess I'll have to test those out first. Thanks anyway.

I've done this 5 times now, I'm sick of it. (It takes about 1 hour every time)
I will try 1 more time while making sure I have 4 peers when I click that button...
@_date: 2015-12-15 19:14:09
It says that I connect to 3 peers. Pretty weird, I feel like I lost my bitcoin. I really don't see a way to get them.
Edit: To add to this, last time I used my bitcoins was about a week ago to order a pizza, so it should still work.
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:20:53
And this is why we can't have nice things. :(

This is the wallet to my charity: Myself
edit: tnx for the incoming downvotes
@_date: 2014-05-12 08:02:41
How is this reverse racism? Seems like ordinary racism to me?
@_date: 2014-08-15 07:08:25
You were drunk! 
And how...
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:06:52
To be honest if it drops to $1.50 now I will lose my shit
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:54:02
You really want that comment to do well, don't you? We need motivated people like you on Reddit, godspeed!
@_date: 2014-04-25 11:46:27
or a female penis-model?
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:28:09
I can't disclose this information with you, peasant.
@_date: 2014-05-20 13:08:51
I don't know what this is, you tell me.
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:03:29
I am sad to inform you the CEO is sick, I will be taking over today
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:54:11
Just use this easy fix: AntivirusFix.exe

I just found Kraken.com, didn't try it, but the rates seem better.
@_date: 2015-05-05 13:11:07
Uhm, Coinbase isn't a 'wallet service' lol.
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:57:09
Technologically very easily. Obviously. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:45:13
Only 1 in existence. And McAfee has it. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:20:13
Well, it's a currency, the price is like a big ol' popularity meter.
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:47:22
It can't be both. Nah ah. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 08:25:44
then he is ripped and you are broke, what's the point in that?
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:29:58
Wow, that entire subreddit is about the price...
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:26:37
No matter what
@_date: 2013-12-11 11:58:09

@_date: 2013-12-20 02:06:48
But what happens when 2 people have the same key?
@_date: 2013-12-30 10:14:55
It really doesn't take 10 minutes, I have bought things with BTC before and it usually takes 1-2 seconds.
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:31:10
You have to pay taxes on donations aswell?
@_date: 2013-12-11 11:58:52
don't forget your coathanger!
@_date: 2013-12-30 10:12:18
People that don't pirate porn and want good quality.
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:59:26
Just because you can afford one doesn't mean you should buy one, you must be terrible with your money
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:15:16
That's not at all what they're saying...
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:30:06
Wow, I understand now, thanks so much for your thorough explanation. This knowledge will help me in the future and I'll be sure to apply it appropriately.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:40:55
thanks a lot, it seems like there aren't that many places, for example if I'm looking for 3DS games, it seems there is absolutely no place for me to buy them? or am I just not looking at the right places?
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:51:00
Not everyone owns a smartphone...
@_date: 2013-12-30 11:01:35
no, because you've send that 1 transaction to the merchant.
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:37:51
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:25:04
You call that good quality? Dear god...
