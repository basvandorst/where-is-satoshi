It's the same thing. I have to make sure my software goes online. When my software goes online, I'm online.
Of course I understand that you can install this software on a server always staying online. If you do, then you are always online. But you as a person has the responsibility to keep that server online! 
Or trust someone else to keep that server online.

Oh that's great then there is a solution for the "fixed fee problem" already.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:31:48
Didn't know about the reserve, but that will fix  or at least make it so that you always take some minimal risk.
Is child-pays-for-parent a way make the parent fee higher?

It is not in the White Paper because it's how bitcoin works. Read this:

Yes, I know you have a period of time to catch the fraud attempt. You have to be online once each period to analyze every new transaction in the blockchain. This is what I mean with you have to be online, if you go offline for to long your channel counterpart might go back to any previous balance state.
My point is that even if you get caught 99% of the time (for people doing there job and go online each week), you might still have 1% chance to succeed with the fraud (some people will basically forget to go online, or don't know that they have to).
The next step is to minimize the punishment you take if he catches you. This is done by making sure you have no balance in the channel you're trying to steal from.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:55:03
Publishing the current contract will not take the entire channel balance as a penalty. I think you have to use the key you got when you created the next contract.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:43:29


The next fraud will be from a different node.


I know they will not be involved in a million transactions per second. I'm talking about the total number of invalid contracts the entire network will together generate.
To prove a contract is "old" you have to know a specific secret. You will get the secret to the previous contract each time you make a new transaction. The list of secrets will grow with the number of hops in the transaction chain * 2 (Alice get Bobs secret and Bob get Alices secret).
There will be a lot of secrets.
Read "Updating the Channel" in this article:
I don't think the amount of secrets will be a problem if everyone just keep them for themselves.
But people will not keep the old secret for themselves, they will make the secret public! Or even better, they will sign a bounty reward contract!
By doing this you can go offline for longer then the timeout. Others will now monitor your old contracts (they might get rewarded).
Now we suddenly have a system where everyone is sending old secrets/bounty reward contracts to a big centralized DB.
If everyone start doing this then we have 1000000 bounty reward contracts per second (for 56000 payments per second with 10 hops).
This big public list of bounty reward contracts is why the network will become public!

This article describes the need of saving each secret to each old contract:
This answer is about the fixed fee problem:
I said "false security" and "this is an illusion" because if the system seems to be secure just because others have not started scamming yet - The security is false and it is an illusion. This is what I think and I'm trying to argue for it in this thread so people will know about it.
I honestly thinks that what I'm saying in this thread is correct, I'm trying to argue the best I can in the comments to get people to understand. If you read my every answers to people you might see why I think the way I do.

I don't think you have to risk the mining fee. I think the person joining the LN will be the one paying for the mining fee. So if someone wants to connect to your node - you will have the opening and closing fee already payed by him.
You decide on who pays and how much (or if you want to split it) when you open the channel, but in the current implementation I think the one who joins the network pays for everything.
I might be wrong here, but if its payed already then you don't risk anything, not even the mining fee.
What you can do of course is to never let your channel counterpart to be completely broke. Don't let him use the channel to reach 0.

It will never reach mass adoption this is why the Lightning Network will not work (and how to abuse it):
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:43:09
I have broken it, people have just not realized it yet :)
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:37:00


I agree, but I'm worried people will start connect to complete strangers.


Yes I know secrets to old contracts outside my own channel is irrelevant for me. I'm talking about the next step in LN, the step where people start to share old contracts so that others can help them catch the thief.
Some people think sharing old contracts (or bounty rewarded contracts) will help LN get rid of the need to go online. This is why you have to worry about the data from the entire network.
We can skip this improvement of course (everyone just watching there own back), or we can implement it and try to overcome the problems I have mentioned.
I can already see one solution and that is for every node to share his old contracts with 10 other nodes. So you will have 10 more old contracts to track, but 10 more will also track yours.


If everyone starts sending bounty rewarded contracts to a public DB. This DB will tell you everything about the transactions done in the LN.

@_date: 2018-01-22 12:47:09
But I need to save the key to prove the old contract is old right? And each old contract have different keys?

You are talking about the CLTV security involved in unrolling the transaction chain.
I'm talking about the CSV that starts from when the transaction enters the blockchain.

Read my comments on that refutation. I'm confident I'm right. He thinks I have misunderstood the breach remedy transaction, but I hasn't.
To be able to send the breach remedy transaction you have to know the secret! This is why the amount of secrets to old contracts will grow like crazy!
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:45:13
Whats the problem with sharing my thoughts on why I don't think it will work? I'm just trying to be skeptic. If I'm wrong, great! Then we have a working system. If I'm right people should know about it.

Try Eclair Mobile for Android it's the easiest I know of that is not custodial.
If you're ok trusting someone else to hold your sats then you can try BlueWallet - they will handle all channels for you so you always can both send and receive (but they can also run away with your money so don't put to much in that wallet)
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:22:42
I have written some about why I think Lightning Network will fail, please read it if you have time.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:50:01
The more I read about how it works the more confident I get that I'm right. You can't broadcast the latest signed transaction. That will be double spending if the fraud attempt makes it into the blockchain before the latest signed contract.
When the fraud contract hits the blockchain your only chance to catch him is to spend the time locked output before he can use it.
And the only way for you to spend his time locked output is if you save the secret!
They talk about it [here]( and on the 3 part article I linked to before.
@_date: 2019-07-21 20:04:53
Do it right now instead. The mempool is currently empty so you can transfer some test funds to the wallet almost for free: 
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:44:10
You can! But you have to manage your own liquidity and channels. It's not hard so you should try Eclair. Just open a channel to ACINQ and you will be able to send to 99% of the Lightning Network.
But if you want to be able to send and receive without manage your channels or liquidity Blue Wallet will handle it for you - but they also have your keys!
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:36:30
In this article they explain why you have to keep track of secrets associated with old contracts (scroll down to Updating the Channel):
Part 3 in that article will tell you the same thing.
From what I understand, old contracts get invalid if you know the secret that will makes them invalid.
Each time you do a new transaction, you reveal the secret that will invalidate the previous contract. If you don't save the list of secrets to invalidate the list of old contracts you can't prove it's an old contract.

Even in opensource wallets some people have the keys/credentials needed to patch the app (send out the automatic app update to the end users). You still trust the people having that permission to release the opensource code and not release some other code that send all private keys to a random server.
Even opensource hardware wallets like Trezor have firmware updates that can be compromised. So you still have to trust the team behind the product to release the reviewed code and not their own stuff.
If you feel like you can't  trust anyone, then a paperwallet/steelwallet is your only solution.

It doesn't matter if it can only be 21 million or 20 million or 15 million (due to lost coins). We will just use milli BTC or micro BTC or nano BTC. If it becomes important in the future to be able to divide the bitcoin into smaller pieces we can fix it! Enabling smaller divisions is not the same as inflation.
There will be lots of lost coins, but that will only make BTC more scarce.

You want to start mining on the next block immediately.
You basically start to mine the next block without knowing what transactions was included in the previous block.
It risk of not mining an empty block before you know what transactions are safe is huge! Why should you risk the coinbase reward for some small fees?
Only once you know what's safe to include in the next block you can start to mine non-empty blocks.

There are plans in the roadmap to enable so you can pay without an invoice.
But even today its not a problem. You can create a static QR code (for donations) and when scanned it redirects you to a web endpoint that generates the lightning invoice and redirect the user to the invoice.
You can do http redirect to a different protocol (lightning:). This way lightning can use small QR codes and the QR code can be static and not contain the in invoice itself, but rather redirect the user to the dynamic invoice.
So with the current system you CAN print posters and put up on the street with static donation QR codes.
Same goes for NFC. Static NFC tags can contain LN invoices by using http redirect.
@_date: 2018-10-29 17:25:57
Im actully planning to do pull requests on all lightning wallets to enable this, but I don't have time right now They already have QR-code scanners, they just need to follow redirects to see if there is an invoice on the other side.
Some goes for NFC. If you scan a NFC with a lightning invoice after redirect, the app opens (after some delay since chrome/safari has open first).
But when the app is in foreground you should be able to receive the invoice without having chrome/safari to open). We just need all lightning apps to listen on NFC while in foreground and follow the redirect!
This is not hard and should be done!

If bitcoin stay at 6400$ that means its not stable. Bitcoin has to increase in value with the same amount dollar looses value (since the dollar is not stable). Standing still in relation to dollar means the value is falling.

Thats true, or maybe I can compile and install samurai wallet and install it as an apk myself so they can't push updates, this way I can verify the sourcecode is safe and never get new updates before I have verified them.

Did I say Samourai is the whole Bitcoin network? That whould be really dumb indeed, but I don't think I said that.
I'm conserned over the fact that I have to trust the app developers to not release a version that will send my coins to an address I don't control.
I don't think they will release an update lite that, I think their goal is to create the safest wallet out there.
But if I use Samourai to store my BTC for like 5 or 10 years, then who knows, maybe in the future they employ someone that releases this "scam update" and suddenly all my savings are gone.
Yes, I have problems trusting people.
@_date: 2018-06-10 12:34:26
No but I trust google to not steal my coins in the next android version, but I dont feel like I can trust the guys behind the samurai wallet.
Ofc the same aruments goes for other wallets as well. I just pick the samurai wallet as an example becouse lots of people say it's the most secure.
If I go into crypto becouse I dont trust my bank and suddenly I have to trust some random app developer.. No offence, but no thanks. I rather stay with my bank.
