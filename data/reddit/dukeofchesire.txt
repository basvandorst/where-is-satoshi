Ah you're back! New username as well! Exciting! 
@_date: 2015-08-09 17:30:49
That would still be a miner?
@_date: 2015-08-09 09:52:35
Few questions. 
"The next bubble is coming"
How do you know? What is this based on other than you want it to happen because you happen to hold coins. 
You act like a bubble is a good thing. Why?
And why do you want a bubble? This sub keeps telling me it isn't about the price but about the technology. Especially when the price is going down, for some reason. 
What happens when there would be a bubble? You sell your bitcoins for dollars?
@_date: 2015-08-09 19:25:06
Because it wasn't programmed to be anonymous. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 19:52:15
At the link called "getting started" in the sidebar. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 19:33:23
That's to where this thread will be downvoted. 
Edit: 29% well done guys! That will teach him mentioning things like this!
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:30:32
I thought the point of Bitcoin was that there is no authority?
@_date: 2015-08-09 17:18:23
Take a guess. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 19:58:20
Yes. Obviously a government honey pot. What else could it possibly be! This is the most likely situation. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 15:18:56
Amazing deal!
@_date: 2015-08-09 18:43:10
Let me guess. You own bitcoins and would suggest people put their money in bitcoins as well. Correct?
@_date: 2015-08-09 17:17:31
Nothing that will matter. 
Edit. I'm confused. Isn't the downvote system for spam and stuff like that? Are people here downvoting me because they disagree? That would be completely idiotic. 
After this comment people actually went through my old posts to downvote those as well. I would consider someone who does that sick in his head. You have some serious mental issues if you do that. Maybe it's time to remove yourself from the internet. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 21:32:18
Sending you 10 btc now! This is amazing!!
@_date: 2015-08-09 19:02:14
Because people aren't interested in buying bitcoins. It's that simple. 
So again i'm getting downvoted because people disagree with me. 
You come to a public message board and try to censor everyone you don't agree with by abusing the voting system. Man, that is seriously sad. 
Anyway, feel free to point out where i'm wrong instead of rage-downvoting me. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 21:51:39
Are you butt hurt the price is going down? Sure looks like it. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:57:07
Huh what?
It's not true but even if it was how would my comment history prove that? 
And why do people go through my comment history when i post something?
Do you consider this healthy behavior? I certainly don't. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 18:38:46
I predict this thread won't be popular. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:43:45
Sounds like fun. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 14:25:01
People who don't own any coins know one thing about Bitcoin. It's involved in scams. A lot. To them it's all one big scam. They don't care about your little lesson. So the OP certainly has a point. 
No one can deny that Bitcoin attracts scammers like shit attracts flies. Is that an issue with Bitcoin? Not sure. Does something need to change if you want mass adoption? Yes, for sure. 
Edit: i thought downvotes were for spam and off topic posts and not for "i don't agree with you"? 
@_date: 2015-08-09 18:41:59
Maybe, just maybe this sub should stop the daily brigading threads. That would actually be good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:17:36
Obviously! 
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:11:46
Woot woot!
@_date: 2015-08-09 14:59:45
Take a guess. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:19:16
You seriously think this sub cares about stuff like that? Come on. 
And downvoted. Because obviously i am wrong and this sub reaaally cares about this. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 21:57:24
a week old article copied to a different site full of ads to spam it here. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 14:27:40
Your username made me laugh. Well done. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:19:08
It's because most things posted here are actually scams. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 21:30:22
Right. Yet if i typed that it will be amazing and take Bitcoin to the moon without anything to back that up i would be showering in upvotes right now. Funny how that works, right?
