Been monitoring  for some time now and it hasn't reached zero. I think it's the same that that NPR piece talks about.

I'll give them a bitcoin certificate instead of the actual thing. Just like they do.

Well we have the (in)famous "I am not Dorian Nakamoto".

Agree but then maybe it is a weird thing to call them "transaction identifiers" when they don't identify transactions.

Use bookmarks.
Don't use google/ddg as your browser address bar.


Always check PGP signatures right after downloading.

Back then, you were not a true bitcoiner unless you had a pair of alpaca socks.
1 BTC for the socks + 1 BTC for the shipping to Europe.

Lots of hoops to jump. In Spain we have tikebit/bit2me:
* Go to one of those places where you can send money (*locutorios*).
* Say how much you want to buy, hand some cash to the clerk, get a voucher.
* Visit 
* Enter how much bitcoin you want to redeem (usually everything), a bitcoin address of yours and the PIN that is shown in the voucher.
* Presto! You are kindly invited to sign up but it's not required.

Do they actually get to know *what* you're buying?
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:33:43
If you ask the same question tomorrow, yes.
If you ask the same question one month from now, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.

Good enough for me if the solution is trustless.

Google knows that. So if eg. 10 people are searching, it's like 1/3 of the population, hence it would be trending af there.

Am from Spain. Never saw "okdiario" before. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:17:46
BS. You're neglecting volume.

Because reddit is not a link sharing platform /s

Please let us know when you sell again so we can buy for the rally to 100k ��

And dick in Spanish.

LN already broke a bear market, but not the current one.
This one will be broken on the next rumour.

Easy. Not everyone is comfortable with their own image so they make a funny face in order not to try to look good and fail (according to themselves) at it. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:39:47
I'm expecting the bottom to be near 1k. Might go lower and not break the bullish trend. Go open a weekly log chart. We are still in bubble mode.

It's a good thing that it doesn't really matter, does it?
@_date: 2018-12-24 16:13:38
I thought the /s was obvious so I didn't type it :)

The recession wasn't isolated to Greece. Pretty much all southern Europe was affected. We were called the PIGS: Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain.

And plotting (what seems to be) its RSI is even stupider.

If you pay those charges with cash, do you have to recursively pay additional fees because of that?
