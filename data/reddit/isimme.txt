 Hi, So my coins were moved to an address starting with a 1 at about 9:50 on 2016-08-02 but are the only coins at this address starting with a 1. Has the hacker moved everyone's coins to all different addresses starting 1 or just one address starting with 1?

I don't have the resources to challenge through the court system but this does potentially draw attention to the issue as shown by past ~~issues~~ petitions. edit:issues

if there is a better way, link?

It's more obvious your response adds nothing of value. I am making my voice heard by supporting this petition(although I didn't create it) and showing others a path to having their view possibly recognized and maybe making a difference. If you want to help, then help, but you have added nothing constructive..

BitInstant will not give you a clear conversion rate avoid like the plague. They still have not reimbursed me after charging the "market rate". You are better of using

Count me, let me know if I can help in anyway, and let us know when and how we can get started? -Thanks

The fee part of the transaction is relatively low, however the mark up because they don't guarantee you the market rate either at the time you place your transaction nor when you deposit your funds is the real issue. For example when I made my transaction the market rate for USD-&gt;BTC was $113.23 per BTC yet they charged me $119.55 a BTC! I have proof that Mt.Gox market rate was never that high when either I placed the order or transferred the money. Yet BitInstant refuses to refund even half of the difference!
BitInstant is shady just search on reddit for people's feedback about them.

From my own experience I recommend inputs.io. The only fee will be .0005 BTC(an on-chain transaction fee) to withdraw that is it. The site is run by TradeFortress who also runs Coinlenders(Bitcoin savings, loans, and CDs) which from my own experience I recommend as well. Best Regards

Thanks Karmaa

Hope I am not too late?
Website looks great
and the service seems to work well.
Hopefully TradeFortress ≠ Pirateat40.

Check either your bank's website or call.
Best of luck

So if I am understanding correctly you have only tried transferring BTC via faucets and it is not working?
Try transferring from either Coinbase to BTC-E or vice versa?
Faucets probably are not working because they are scamming for info..hope this helps, best of luck and always question anything that seems too easy.

bitinstant does not guarantee when you get market rate for USD to BTC.
they gave me a "market rate" that is higher then when I purchased and refunded not even half the difference of what I should have received. my advice avoid bitinstant USD-&gt;BTC service until they wise up and make it so you know the market rate when purchasing, otherwise you receive whatever they decide is the market rate after the transaction is complete..

Hi Karma,
Pool distribution by what method?
Pool fees?
Any other relevant info as your site doesn't have much info(yet)?
Best Regards,

bitinstant does not guarantee when you get market rate for USD to BTC. they gave me a "market rate" that is higher then when I purchased, and so far have refunded not even half of the difference of what I should have received. my advice avoid bitinstant USD-&gt;BTC service until they wise up and make it so you know the market rate when purchasing, otherwise you receive whatever they decide is the market rate after the transaction is complete. their customer service as well is really difficult to deal with, never fully reading you emails and always asking for information that you have repeatedly provided. my case isn't isolated either, search around and you will find many people complaining about bitinstant.
