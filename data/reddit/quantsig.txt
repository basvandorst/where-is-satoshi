Much appreciated! Surprisingly the Inter models perform by and large much better than the Intra models. We're working on a third generation now which will be hybrids pricing solely based on cross-market data. Initial tests there are very positive. But it's too early to say how it will perform in the real world.

It may very well do. We simply want to be sure we always get the best price.

We process system-wide around 200 input instruments, from which we derive a further hundred or so signalling inputs for our hybrid models. However, each model utilizes far fewer inputs, generally chosen by PCA in order to reduce noise and improve performance.
The BTC models are all quite new. We're fascinated by the market so we've decided to apply our trade to this new market space. We're amazed at what we've found.

I think it would be a mistake to discount the purpose of CNN and FOX in the grand scheme of things. They serve as extremely effective polarization channels, which is what is needed to keep the plebians' arguments in order. In China, CCTV combined with the microblogs, etc serves the same purpose - albeit in their own way.

Did you check your spam folders? They seem to end up there a lot.

Overall the whole thing is very good news. But I wouldn't for a second believe what CCTV puts out is what the Chinese are believing any more than saying what CNN or FOX says is the voice of Americans.

We're currently running the following models, with a bunch more in development. All pricing Gox, but other exchanges are coming.
 BTCAUD (Intra),
 BTCAUD (Inter),
 BTCCAD (Intra),
 BTCCAD (Inter),
 BTCCNY (Intra),
 BTCCNY (Inter),
 BTCEUR (Intra),
 BTCEUR (Inter),
 BTCGBP (Intra),
 BTCGBP (Inter),
 BTCJPY (Intra),
 BTCJPY (Inter),
 BTCNZD (Intra),
 BTCNZD (Inter),
 BTCUSD (Intra),
 BTCUSD (Inter),
 Gold / BTC Ratio,
 SP 500 / BTC Ratio
Model types:
Intra models look at current data from within the BTC pairs such as BTCUSD, BTCEUR, etc. They are available 7 days a week, but are outperformed by the Inter models. Inter models look within BTC and across markets, at BTC performance against traditional financial markets, such as the S&amp;P, Gold, Crude, Bonds, etc. They are only available on weekdays outside of holidays, during market hours. Ratio models look across markets to price the target ratio. They are hybrids which are often extremely sensitive and are commonly in the 'leading' state.

We have had quite a few announcements, from our initial acceptance of BTC as payments, through our initial BTC model notices, to our recent publishing of BTC price and ratio models. Check out our news or blog:

Some notes about our BTC models. Please be aware that as this is a new market, with considerable volatility, we consider modeling in this environment to be very experimental.
Be sure to explore all BTC (and traditional) models. Desk and automated traders in particular will find considerable value in the cross-market perspective we provide.
