Welcome to the club! That’s the actual reason it’s is called hodl. Now you are ready! It was always going to be this way so don’t worry about it, only what you have left and the knowledge to acquire more.

Somebody just sold a couple thousand btc on the exchanges. When volume is this low, it makes an impact on price. The question is, do they know something we don’t or are they buying alt coins with it.
@_date: 2018-09-28 23:57:09
Zzzz is a good thing for btc right now imo. A little stability never hurt nobody. It’s nicely holding above 6500. That’s amazing when you think about it. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 22:56:05
This is my first comment, I better make it a good one
@_date: 2018-09-29 01:16:06
Its actually kind of sad that I want btc to go down to 6200. again but only so I can buy more. Guess I’m just selfish.

These are great days my friends. When it hit $10k, instead of buying btc once a week, I put my dollars on Coinbase pro and let it sit. Now I have a stockpile to continue my dca. Just made my first purchase in awhile at $6850. I’ll continue dca’ing till we are back to $10k then I’m done! I’ll hodl as long as it takes. The point is, to all you newbies and doomsayers, this is your last best time to accumulate cheap bitcoins. It will be about a year max and it might lower, but it will rise again to new heights. Remember, good investors think in terms of years not months. Here was my prophecy I posted before the big dip and I got downvoted.....��

Do a search for bitcoin atm’s near you.

Zoom out past a year though and btc is up huge! Didn’t know 1 year was the new standard in judging an investment. 
@_date: 2019-11-08 03:22:24
I’ve bought and sold thousands of bitcoins! I used to mail order steroids for me and a couple friends on the internet from some guy in Croatia. He only took bitcoin and it was super cheap back then. I remember having a bunch left over from all the transactions but I never found my old computer :(
@_date: 2018-10-27 16:40:35
Huge btc sell order just went through. 500+ on binance alone.  We’ll see in the next few hours if we see some more price dipping. Why sell that low unless you know something?I feel like with this low volume, the next few weeks are critical.
@_date: 2018-10-27 16:56:42
Well i meant critical in the short term... I hodl some and I trade some.

I agree. My strategy of buying only under 10k has been working perfectly!.....for now.
@_date: 2019-08-03 15:25:53
Because people buy it low trying to sell it to somebody else for a profit. This reasoning suggests something of a ponzi scheme. It’s not of course, but it’s the closest thing they can equate it with. Just about every asset on the planet is bought at some point and expectantly sold at a later date for profit.

Oh ya! I’ve been in a good mood all weekend. I mostly missed  the boat years ago on bitcoin. There’s no way I was missing the boat again. Just sucks I don’t have people to share this ride with. I have been pleading with friends and family to get into bitcoin since the dip but they don’t even want to hear it. Oh well, lurking on here isn’t so bad and the memes are great at least. The dancing shoes is my favorite. Word to the wise..it may go down, but it will always be going up. I lost some trying to trade but oh well. Now I just accumulate every week 10% of my earnings and hodl. Ask me in 10 years if it was worth it.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:52:03

Wow it just blew right through 10k like butter.....huh
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:14:00
Ya this ain’t stopping. I watched 1000 bitcoins sold in 1 minute on binance and it just ate and kept going.
@_date: 2019-12-28 20:16:11
I’m kind of in the same boat. Been waiting for the bottom for a few months now. I feel like this is a good time to split my stack into quarters and dca it all in over the next 4 weeks. Even if the bottom is not in, I feel we are close enough to get some nice profits 6 months from now.
@_date: 2019-12-26 21:26:25
You only see what you want to see. Dollars and other fiat are responsible for way more illicit activity than all cryptos combined. These transactions are completely anonymous. Not to mention gold, diamonds, etc. Why is btc given this “illicit moniker”, ask yourself that.

 Not sure if this is a meme yet but this is what goes through my head when people tell me to sell now that it’s high.
@_date: 2019-12-25 19:17:27
You must be very young and or very naive. You will absolutely get rekt trading at 100x. You’re liquidation point is too close to withstand price spikes in bitcoin. Thats how these exchanges get their funding. By liquidating over leveraged positions. Not to mention fees involved with leverage trading.��
@_date: 2019-12-29 18:15:36
Scam alert. I’ve been seeing a lot of seemingly legit articles about a new liquid cooled miner called zigbit that boasts huge mining profits. I checked out the website and it looks legit too. I did not buy one but it is almost certainly a scam. Anybody else seeing these popping up on your news feeds?

@_date: 2019-12-14 17:52:23
Do some research my friend. You’re negative approach is not the best way to come to an unbiased answer to any question. Bitcoin is a deflationary asset which in theory makes it far superior than fiat that is printed out of thin air, which in turn, is the definition of inflation. Also, my coins are as liquid, or more liquid than any other asset I have. That is just scratching the surface. You can use these examples to springboard your fresh research into the world of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-25 19:24:16
How long did it take after the last halving before the bull run? A while. So yes, the halving might be less rewarding in the short term. However, we touched 14k this summer and I suppose we hit 18k ish this summer then a pull back and those aren’t even halving bull runs. I’m banking on a 2021-2022 bull run, we shall see.

I’m first, you can all move along.......
By the way, it took approximately 3 years for the price to reach ath again following the 2014 bullrun. That would put us at 2021-22 for another rocket ship. Not saying it won’t go up from here but patience is a virtue.

Well that was fun! I actually sold on binance at 6100 and bought back at 5700 something but lost almost half of those earnings when I tried to do it again. It just shot up so fast��. Shoulda just left well enough alone and went about my day. The dip sucks yes but guess what? Btc gives as good as it gets so don’t panic and hold. Besides, I’d rather embrace a new tech like btc with all it’s possibilities and take the licks than to be some troll reveling in others languish. Just sad really.

Not gonna lie, was hoping we’d avoid this but it was inevitable. I’m in this for the long haul so selling is not an option at this point. Will continue to buy these dips until bakkt and sec ruling in a few months, then reassess.
@_date: 2018-11-18 18:01:35
Yes yes. This was the plan the whole time. If you can day trade it, fine. Otherwise accumulate and hodl. It may take till 2022 if there aren’t any catalysts pushing it even higher. Which there are. Why is this so hard for people to grasp?
@_date: 2019-01-26 22:55:50
Search coin flip atm or bitcoin atm near you. You can deposit btc right from those into your bread wallet. Under $900. for the day and you don’t need an id.
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:24:24
It’s a very real possibility that the market is being devalued before bakkt and sec decision early March. If sec approves, I can certainly guarantee this and price will shoot up a bit. If not, then more blood in the streets for a while. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:09:27
Seriously though, mods r actually to blame for these trolls. Remove them, nothing they say in these “scenarios” are real.

And they just said center so as to not sound too extreme right(it’s a crazy world right now!). By definition a leftist advocates for more government programs and larger government.

Oh well, I have all this disposable income despite not listening to you experts.
@_date: 2019-01-22 23:32:15
Sorry bud but hodlers are not going to sell at $1000. or lower. That makes 0 sense, not to mention, by definition they would not be hodlers. I think it could drop some but the only people who would sell at those prices are those that are buying now.
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:11:00
Just moved the rest of my holdings from exchange to cold storage. Filled out another recovery card just in case��. I got a few nice shorts on the way down so it’s not all bad. I’m not gonna fumble around trying to find bottom when the truth is, no one knows. I suspect it’s 2500-3200. Still buying for now though but damn! Balling ain’t easy, especially with all the noise trying to get me off my mark. Oh well, if i had listened to all that garbage, I wouldn’t have taken risks and wound up where I am today!  Oh, and props to all my fellow hodlers, the real gangsters! Remember, fortune favors the bold.

The sheep don’t die, they only multiply. Bye Bye, we’ll see you again when it’s +10k. and gold is up a few hundred. This is the never ending mindset of the masses but god bless em.

@_date: 2019-01-22 23:06:01

@_date: 2019-01-28 03:27:25
Isn’t this flawed to the fact that the dollar is worth way more there. You actually run into the same problem you tried to avoid. If you can buy a house with $500., what is the point of comparing the two?

Ok 666gold, who’s favorite subreddit is “why are women so skittish and flighty...” lol wtf? 
@_date: 2018-12-24 01:23:23
Congrats bro!
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:15:50
Yes plz explain the pic. Mobile banking is a cell phone.
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:25:15
Oh shit ya I laughed at that one!
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:59:23
Oh ok thx. Yes this is like the briefcase cell phone in the late 80’s. It will get better!!
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:53:34
The reason for the pump and action is a couple thousand bitcoins were all bought at once over a few exchanges. I saw the huge 1 minute candles on binance earlier. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:23:33
@_date: 2018-12-23 01:16:30
You are wrong on the first part and right on point 2! Not bad for a troll. Kudos to you sir!
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:52:22
Yes this will take a long time for bitcoin to catch up to but it will. Anyway, it’s apples and oranges. Bitcoin is a store of wealth like gold but better. It moves huge amounts of wealth anywhere in the world quickly and cheaply. Credit cards cannot do that. That’s all it really needs to do to have great value.....but there’s also so much more. And 99% lol, most people are screwed on their credit cards who are u kidding. And try using your cards overseas! It’s a fricken hassle and they want to block most transactions. Bitcoin solves this problem too!

Be back?Says the redittor for a week lol. You’re posts are all at this level
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:38:03
Sorry then you must be one of the dumb traders. Or you could just wait and see a few days but you already prob bought back. Ouch
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:56:06
Well I don’t mind an alternative to banks and credit cards. I’m glad you love the banking sector so much, I guess I’m just not as trusting as some.
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:12:53
Thanks for the honest review. I will be checking this out
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:18:56
Do not feed the trolls. This reaction is what they want. It makes it all that much more enjoyable drinking their tears on the way up.
@_date: 2018-12-09 16:39:19
Wow a weekend pump! Haven’t seen this in months. Could be a nice sign. I’ve caught quite a few in the past. Missed this one but haven’t been charting as much lately. Gonna make a prediction about this pump says the swami!: there will be a big announcement probably tomorrow which would explain a nice hike like this. It’s just the 99% of us get it late. Let’s see if I’m right.
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:40:05
Mery Christmas all
@_date: 2018-12-10 03:22:38
Well you might get your answer this week. Futures on stocks are bleak. If they drop more this week and bitcoin continues its current rise, then the correlation is broken as it has many times in the past. You do have a well thought out opinion but it may be based on a little fear of the market right now and rightfully so. My opinion is btc does what btc does. We’ve seen it numerous times and it is just following a natural downstream at the moment. I guess it will play out though.
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:38:07
Ya I got some dinars. I brought a few back home with me. Your story is garbage though
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:18:10
Also, I send my coins to an exchange from Coinbase, then to my wallet. There are more fees this way but better safe than sorry.
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:01:58
I feel like a bottom will be realized early to mid 2019. Then some ups and downs while it slowly lurches forward a few years and then bam! Bull run once again. Hodl and forget....I’m not much of a trader, for me there’s more money in investing. Takes more patience though. Happy 2019 folks. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 02:07:40
If that last remark didn’t make sense to you than you have more important things to worry about;)
@_date: 2018-12-19 04:30:52
There are definitely some big green 5 minute candles �� n the exchanges. Someone is buying up large chunks. They don’t really follow trading patterns either.
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:52:30
Nobody actually listens to redditor for a day. We just think it’s sad. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 02:43:10
Your English needs some work and you didn’t understand what he said. Sorry to have said it like that��
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:24:13
Ok so legit question.....the IRS can seize my bank account at any time. Can they also seize or freeze funds from my Coinbase account linked to that bank account? Thanks for any info in advance. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:42:42
Lol that was great! I’m a hodler but damn too fucking funny! Was gonna show the wifey but she wouldn’t get it��
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:40:35
This is fake news
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:08:37
Thanks guys I really appreciate all the replies. There’s still many good peops in here with great info! I do get my coins off cb and into storage as soon as I can but I have to initially buy them somewhere and they stay there for a few days before I can get them out. I will look into other ways to buy. Thanks again guys this helps more than you know��
P.s. I am not shady,  my businesss is taking hits and the irs got the cake, now they’re coming for the crumbs.
@_date: 2018-12-21 01:57:47
True but it sure does look like we are heading back to the 6100 level before more sideways movement. That’s a definite scenario. I’ve been happy buying in the $3k range though.
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:43:13
You post the same argument every time though. My question is why someone who is always broke  is worried about bitcoin so much. You hate it I get it but you are obsessed with posting bs. Does it help make you feel better?
@_date: 2018-12-15 03:37:15
Your English is better but you actually understood less��
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:33:08
Wow that makes this kid an expert compared to most peops in the sub!
@_date: 2018-12-10 02:57:20
You just said you were broke, you don’t have fiat or bitcoin. I doubt you have any knowledge of finance except for some bs excerpts which you clearly plagiarize.
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:29:29
Ok no offense but anybody else besides 7 Karma guy have an answer��
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:09:17
You have to read past comments on these btc haters. They give you an insight on how pathetic they are. Noo user guy only joined 6 days ago and  only posts are over a hundred shitting on btc. Wow what kind of life do you have? Other guy was all about Dungeons &amp; Dragons for years up until about a month ago now only shitting on btc lol. Down a few more is a eth shiller who recently said “I really hate my life right now!” Hahaha sorry that’s so sad. Don’t you have someone irl to talk to buddy? 
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:45:27
What’s with the flesh lite obsession though?! Bro stop posting and go out and get an actual female. Trust me your outlook will change. Much love brother, you can do it!
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:36:52
Im not mad at all, having a bit of fun actually. Plus it’s all true. Just bought the dip again and feeling great! If you had some extra income you’d buy yourself some upvotes. I think I’m gonna buy some just to have some more fun. Do you get banned for these?
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:20:22
Was that a question? 
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:38:22
Wow looks like you’re right more than most. Appreciate the feedback. Let me know if you got any more pearls in the future!!
@_date: 2018-12-22 22:45:38
I’m doing the same
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:26:12
No! Lol
