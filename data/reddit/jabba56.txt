Tldr: you are an idiot who can't read simple instructions
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:30:31
Put your dummy back in, child

Check out Revolut to get far better exchange rates
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:10:27
If your name on kraken doesn't match your name at the bank (exact same) then that is the problem
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:50:00
...because it's priced in.  The market isn't stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:06:51
ETC.  Lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:46:34
Revolut.  Thank me later
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:08:00
You lost 0 BTC, you only gained bitcoincash.  You are incorrectly remembering how much BTC you had
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:09:59
So below what it currently costs to mine a bitcoin? Ok
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:43:41
Use Revolut.  No sepa tx fee and proper EURGBP conversion rate
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:59:19
Would you lend credit to people throwing it in crypto? ^_^ Don"t blame them
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:29:13
Not if you actually want to make the best possible money
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:49:24
Lol, forget dips, wait for the correction 
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:49:09
Good ol' Trevor
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:43:43
Your bank name probably doesnt match your kraken name perfectly and it got held for manual review?
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:27:36
Dumped that garbage months ago.  Their team is a joke and are the reason I bailed.
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:06:16
Yes there is
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:19:01
Personally would of waited until 3600 but i think you are right to sell.  Confident you can buy back in at the same or lower. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:23:51
He was joking and laughing his ass off when the media wrote stories about it.  Read his past tweets...
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:38:59
You do realise he was trolling, right? He was laughing at how stupid people were for believing him the next day on his twitter...
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:44:56
Lol, bought at the top?
@_date: 2017-08-10 05:37:06
Cute thought but no, you will be fucked over quicker than you can blink.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:47:36
Lol.  1800 was a prediction from before the fork.  Author is retarded.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:41:08
Sounds more like a phishing email, coinbase would never do that
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:10:50
Amen.  Why the fuck is this even news? Who cares.  Anyone buying crypto on credit is a degenerate gambler.
Don't buy crypto with someone elses money, period.
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:27:58
Of course it is
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:58:58
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:16:48
Lol, you don't even understand what's going on in the article do you? If you did then you'd know it's not a (potential) issue beyond first time use.
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:01:50
Shoulda woulda coulda.
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:12:54
Look what you did.
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:52:14
Lol? Always back up the code when you set up 2fa
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:59:39
Congrats :)
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:36:52
Expect the unexpected! :)
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:53:07
$2900-$3300 range will be the bottom of the upcoming correction
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:50:59
If only exchanges let you set limit orders...
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:11:51
Learn to read

He had API keys with withdrawals enabled. :/
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:42:48
Buy the rumour sell the news...it ALREADY sky rocketed back from its low.  Buying near 3k is risky, people know this.
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:45:30
You are a complete fucking moron, I hope you know that.
