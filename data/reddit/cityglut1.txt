For the example you chose, where it's a question of converting into fiat, centralization is inevitable, since the Counterparty protocol deals with user-created assets, XCP, and BTC, and not with fiat. On the other hand, in the example I have presented, despite the potential points of failure, you have a peg to the USD, which allows you to keep your funds within digital currency, while theoretically also not losing the advantage of cashing out into fiat immediately.
Counterparty also allows you to make contracts for difference, which provides a more sophisticated currency peg without the same points of failure as the use-case I gave before.
Within the Counterparty protocol itself, there is the potential for a robust financial ecosystem, while also allowing users to hedge against the volatility of that ecosystem with respect to fiat.

We know the Dogeparty Team well, and think what they are doing is very cool.On the other hand, there are well-known security compromises that are made with faster block times, and cheaper transaction costs are not an inherent feature of Dogecoin; transaction fees are closely related to transaction volume. As the Dogeparty website itself says,

Counterparty nodes only communicate with each other through the blockchain, so what matters is only how many Bitcoin nodes there are.

Counterparty assets can be stored at any Bitcoin address.

1. Proof of burn ;)
2. The expense of making a transaction, the volume of transactions and the total value of the mining equipment behind a blockchain are related in such a way as for the one to act as a check upon the others. At this moment, we see no compelling altenrative to leveraging the power of the Bitcoin blockchain, but Counterparty can certainly be ported to a sidechain or an alt-blockchain if the Bitcoin blockchain were ever to suffer major scalability problems.

No, it was not.

Ultimately, the time-frame for regulatory approval is largely out of our hands, but we are taking all the necessary steps to get it done as soon as possible. We're working with some extremely talented and experienced people!

I don't think there is a list of "trusted" feed providers (which would in any case be centralized and subjective). But you can find a list of all feed provider source addresses [here](

It would be possible, for example, for a centralized exchange (BitStamp, for example) to create an asset called BITSTAMPEURO, such that if you buy 100 BITSTAMPEURO, you can then exchange those BITSTAMPEURO for 100 Euros before a certain date. The route would then be: Bitcoin-&gt;BITSTAMPUSD-&gt;Euros. The details of how this could be implemented would need to be decided by BitStamp itself, of course, but there are several possible ways. 
It's important to remember that Counterparty is a protocol, not a suite of services, and it "how Counterparty can help you" depends on how the protocol is used.

With the smart contract scripting language, Namecoin-like functionality can be implemented. Vitalik has written about this on several occasions.

Counterparty does not centralize any functions. However, centralized functionality can be built on top of Counterparty, if people want to work around Bitcoin's blocktime, the same way it can with Bitcoin .
