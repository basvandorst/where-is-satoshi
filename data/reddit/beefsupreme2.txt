I didn't respond to their "How do you get the money you use to buy Bitcoin?" question properly and got my account restricted.  I said something along the lines of "Through hard work" and that wasn't good enough.  Had to actually tell them how I earn money.
It was weird and very unBitcoinlike.  But what can you do?  Local traders want 10-20% more for the same coin.

Ah the kneejerk of in full swing.  Coinbase is currently the most trusted 3rd party holder, and cheapest/safest/easiest way to get bitcoins.

Well, when bitcoin didn't have a lot of value, transaction fees were set a little high by miners so they would get more of the action.  Now that the price skyrocketed, they haven't exactly scaled the transaction fees back to reflect price.
It needs some sort transaction fee adjustment mechanism similiar to the mining difficulty algorithm.

Scams have been running there for some time.  Mostly shitcoin scams, well thought out too.

Been a long time since I visited there.  Don't see the need in ever going back.
@_date: 2015-12-16 14:18:08
He's basically saying let Bitcoin handle the transactions that require security and decentralization, and let any other method (Visa, Litecoin, etc) handle the low value transactions.
In other words, we cannot have big blocks without sacrificing decentralization/security.
At least that is my take on it.

People will only listen to Satoshi when it comes to big protocol changes, and he's missing in action right now.

We are sacrificing too much mining decentralization for security (hashing power).  While security has skyrocketed, decentralization has tanked.

I don't know, maybe it has something to do with the inherent weakness of a debt based economy. Compound interest is terribly efficient at transferring money from the middle class and poor to fill the pockets of the wealthy.
Maybe if people only bought what they could afford, and rich folks didn't have a government money printer to refill their coffers when necessary, we could mitigate some of the serious inequality issues that are running rampant.
Why is this important?  Because political instability goes hand in hand with social inequality.  Just ask any French aristocrat about eating cake and its consequences.

Mycelium local trader app.  You get your private keys at the trade, unlike localbitcoins.

Nonsense.  You can monitor addresses with Mycelium, and the data shows up instantly.
Rassah, you got a sweet app my friend!
@_date: 2014-06-26 01:50:35
The account it is tied to cannot be changed without losing trade history, but you can add new addresses and use them to trade with very easily.  Use a new address with each new person you deal with, or if you are really paranoid use a new address with each trade.  You have to back up the private keys and all that jazz with each new address.

Small business would be more competitive by using Bitcoin. Your failure to see the advantages in accepting it for small business speaks volumes.
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:47:15
Yeah, the reality is a four year degree comes with a 50K income that the gubbmint chunks 35-40% right off the top, and the mortgage system rapes you for 300% on money borrowed over 30 years.  They trade your home around like stock chips, with solid mortgage payers going for premiums, like myself and my shitty little abode.  God forbid you choose to procreate, then what is left is barely 20% of the money you earned to eat and have fun with.  Fuck this system, hello bitcoin.

Ross did nothing wrong.  He created a mashup between ebay and craigslist, where the users are responsible for their own ads.  By this skewed logic, the gubbmint should haul the ebay board off to jail too, seeing as plenty of stolen/illegal stuff passes through their halls as well.

Not only is it great for trading, but it has a communication feature that is the hidden gem that no one talks about.  You can literally text any bitcoiner on there and talk about whatever for free.  I don't even know the guys real names or phone numbers, but I can communicate anonymously and securely.
I think they should work on improving this part of their app.

Like someone else said, you should just purchase BTC from Coinbase.  If you are selling on Coinbase, the IRS will have all that data shortly after New Years, and be prepared to be taxed for your gains.  You should spend it, or sell it on Mycelium or LocalBitcoins.  Choose a reputable trader, and things are smooth and quick.

Actually I have had good experience with Chinese made products.  I had a 2007 Hyundai Sonata Limited that was the most reliable, well made car.  Then there was the 2006 Jetta my wife had that leaked oil from every orifice and everything from door handles to trunk latches were breaking constantly.

I DO NOT CARE!  
It has been my view that the algorithm for mining blocks should also be changed at some interval to prevent heavy mining centralization.
I think the benefits of that outweigh the risks.
I hope Satoshi has been working on that while he has been MIA.
@_date: 2016-11-27 00:38:40
I was surfing the web at my desk during lunch and came across a short article on some random site.  This was 2013, shortly after it shot to 225 and then plummeted down to 80.
I bought my first coins from MtGox.  Then bought some from some Michigan undergrad hackers trading forum.
I vividly remember someone placing a 10K USD buy order on this little trading website ~80 a coin.

I hate the banking system with a passion, compound interest, leeching off the citizens of every country they reside, siphoning off GDP in exchange for absolutely nothing.  They move money around, that is it.  They don't create anything, they don't contribute to society in any real meaningful way.
Yet there they are, on every corner, a brick and mortar "safehouse" for your hard earned wealth.
Bitcoin will make them irrelevant, and and in ten to twenty years most of the corruption will be gone and you will see economies around the world start to boom again.

Best way to get bitcoins is through Coinbase or local traders.  Local traders (the ones with lots of successful trades), are your best bet for quick, anonymous coins.  Cost you about 10%, but it's worth it for this very reason.

I got a question for ya. 
I wired this fool a thousand bucks before the exchange went belly up, I mean like a week before when the coins dropped so low my greed overtook good reason.
This amount never showed in my Gox account, and never showed since that Japanese guy has been handling this mess.  (Who coincidentally I feel is Satoshi in an interested plot twist)
That fuckin' money went somewhere, and is sitting in someone's bank account.  Care to shed some light on what may have happened to the balance?

I used to tell customers we accept bitcoin and offer steep discounts for said payment option, but after doing more explaining than work it became counter-productive.  Then Bitcoin's bad press made the option look shady to potential customers, altogether making even mentioning it unattractive.

I said it before and I'll say it again.  The Darknet brings Bitcoin its baseline value.  If I had to throw a rock in the pond I would say its true value is in the 1500-2500 range for Darknet baseline.

You know what I find puzzling?  That after Dorian was "outed" the vast majority immediately conclude he is not Satoshi.

AirBitz is more for the general population and easier to use. You don't see all the 'guts' on Airbitz, and it has a better GUI.  Also, the directory is a very mainstream addition.

Hey I remember D1srupt1v3 from the first Cryptolina.  Outspoken older hottie.
I remember her being mesmerized by Buterin's short explanation of Bitcoin 2.0 vs Crypto 2.0.
She wasn't the only one.

You have a responsibility, nay DUTY, to resist laws that are immoral and oppressive.

Politicians not letting a tragedy go to waste.
Time to push agenda while the population is feeling insecure.
@_date: 2015-11-16 12:23:26
Thank you.
I especially like the quote on Mises Regression Theory under the Economics tab.
He plainly, and simply, states Bitcoin's intrinsic value in layman's terms.

Except, you are here...now.  And left behind a nice, steamy shitpost of your own.

Are you suggesting, holding that much coin, the guy didn't have a password to authorize bitcoin spends?
Could he have been so dumb to leave the keys in the lock?  
@_date: 2015-11-26 20:31:50
Cannot say I agree. Had to leave for vacation before an important package arrived, left a detailed note for the driver, and they followed it to the letter. I was impressed. Just knew they would leave it at the front door completely exposed.

Damn it, I want one.

Been there. Nothing straightforward like "click here to buy with bitcoin dummy."

There are more buyers than sellers.

I am going to enter the race for President. 
I plan to initiate a full conversion to the metric system, bitcoin as state currency, uberisation of everything, cryptographic voting (the people pass/reject laws, elected officials just come up with the proposal), repeal all property taxes (job  and make privacy an important aspect of my administration.
Who's with me?

Strange question.
Is it safe to buy math particles?
Is it safe to add and subtract in your 40's?

Maybe you are a scammer yourself and now that your scammed coins won't move your are stinking up the place.

Warren is just looking after his investments.  He owns a huge chunk of Wells Fargo.  
He may be biased, but don't think he doesn't have a massive hoard of bitcoin just in case he is wrong.
Men like that know how to make money.   And there is money to be made in trading bitcoin, and mining it.

And yet, for the next four years 1800 coins will still be pumped out daily.  That deflation sure feels like inflation.

I hate this convoluted gobbledygook. It is intentionally written to confuse whomever is reading. Unenforceable overall, but allowing the state to choose who to charge and apply punishment.

I will accept bitcoin from aliens or dogs.  But not cats.

Drama queens.
Sometimes this forum is like listening to a bunch of old ladies gossiping.
Thousands of face dumps and pumps, money laundering, and just now three letter agencies are "looking" at Cryptsy.  FYI, they have BEEN looking at Cryptsy, and the article has no solid proof of anything.

Value is a human contruct.  Humans can use bitcoins differently than gold, but both have "value" as a result of how we make use of their properties.
Alex is a thinking man.
@_date: 2015-10-08 23:08:30
I still think you are Satoshi.  Just don't think Goodman would have run that story if she didn't have her man.  That would kill her career.    
However, if a signed/confirmed PGP message from the real Satoshi out's his real identity and he stands up to be counted, then moves his whole stash to prove it then I will believe you.
Till then, suspect 
@_date: 2015-10-07 12:02:23
I think the idea with bitcorn's is to not use fiat at all.  So a business model involving a marriage between fiat and bitcoin doesn't work?  Color me surprised.
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:32:00
Sell all your bitcoin, wait for the drop, buy back in and get more coin.
Any more advice needed?

From my first attempts at installing Bitcoin Core on Ubuntu years ago (wasn't even called Core then) I remember this guys name from the github storage.

Getting folk to use Bitcoin is like getting them to use the metric system.  Ain't gonna happen till a whole generation dies out and kids are taught it in kindergarten.  Doesn't matter how logical the idea...some folk just don't want to change.
Set the price in phony fiat, allow smart folk to check out with real money.

Ross, you are officially a sucker.  
You gave them your bitcoin treasure in the hopes of leniency, and sparing you from prison time.  They took your wealth, and then took your freedom anyway.
Lesson to all, and learned the hard way.  Never give up your coins, no matter what.
@_date: 2015-03-04 00:38:21
How embarrassing.

You know if you buy at a lower point you can have more bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-10-24 16:44:02
They didn't want fiat?   Hmmm, this seems contradictory to what media wishes me to believe about the value of the bitcorn.
