It wouldnt surprise me if this sucker rally ends with a 1 year slow decline to 4k.

I certainly would not mind a 500usd btc.

Singularity.net seems like an ambitious AI project. Its envisions a blockchain based cloud solution towards achieving a benign artificial general intelligence.
Don't know if that answers your question. Other than being blockchain based it does not directly has anything to do with btc.

Im up infinite % as i got back my initial investment in january and payed back my student debt then. All remaining crypto is sitting tightly on a ledger waiting for the next hype run of greater fools

NexusEarth uses 3 mining channels, one of which is looking for dense prime clusters which can be useful for supporting mathmetical research  The other two channels are just sha-3 and pos

Aside the fake news, it would be beautiful if the one that might have/get access to satoshis BTC would set up his own price-system. The Satoshi Prize instead of the Nobel Price. Given yearly to those who put significant effort into fighting corruption that seems to be a globalized scourge nowadays.

Eventually a certain inflation might be necessary to incentivize miners in order to guarantee sufficient security.

There you have a maximalist if-then statement. And if bitcoin takes a partial role in the economy? Have you actually calculated what the fee profit for miners would be in different scenarios? How would the resulting equilibrium, when you fill in the numbers, determine the maximum possible hashrate that is still economically viable?

What is your counter-argument against the fact that bitcoin provides a unique option for people to opt out of the fiat system when it threatens to harm them, say in Venezuela or Iran. Fiat can easily be used as weapons by the powers that control them. Its a way to harm a population when geopolitics call for hostile sanctions in the hope to encite internal revolt and a change of regime. How would you look at crypto as extra option when you are not comfortably sitting in your Western chair?

Open source P2P lightning network that puts a million transactions within 1 block insertion.

Grats on your gains.
Brave of you to gamble when it was in such bubble territory.
@_date: 2018-11-27 11:16:39
Its just general bubble mechanics of overexited people who wanted to get rich. 
There are no infinite coins like bitcoin, that has enough hashing power behind it to prevent tampering by entire nations.

Besides all this talk about fees or no fees. What about the concentration of power that central banks have? The open source P2P nature of bitcoin and LN open a completely new possibility space that could - with maturation of the technology - render this old power structure of central banks obsolete.

I disagree. Other crypto projects that build their own blockchain architecture innovate the technology. Yahoo was there before google. Myspace was there before Facebook.

Isn't the whole forth and back calculation with gold redundant when prices of gold around the globe are relatively equal?
@_date: 2019-01-22 16:01:39
I mean your calculation then just falls back on the  amount of stores that accept a currency, be it fiat or crypto

Had a similar situation with some relatives who wanted to learn more. Gave them both a Ledger as birthday present.   
 They were really happy with it and keen to learn how it works.

Just wait until quantative easing meets with global resource scarcity or lagging food production due to climate change and then judge how 'unbroken' this system is.
There are some serious flaws in a system that demands unlimited growth from a resource-limited planet having a parasitic species that grows just as exponentially as all the major economic bubbles presently occurring.
We need a systematic change towards a more circular economy. Seriously all academic papers in the field of sustainable technologies start with this regurgitated introduction section. But despite all potential technological advances, the structural efficiency driven gluttoneus behavior that arises from the current economic model will not bring a healthy balance between us and our environment.
