YES, I and a small group of men and women have a weekly Skype call with "the admiral" aka Satoshi. EVERYTHING I HAVE SAID IS THE TRUTH, hashing the Genome incorporated into the blockchain is for the purpose of life extention, as the Admiral says " I dont want to live forever through my work, I want to live forever!  I do indeed know the identity of Satoshi but I would rather die than disclose it to the public. It's true I'm trolling you all for shits and giggles, I do this because it's fun knowing the truth, it's fun knowing how he hid his identity so well via a trust organization. A very small portion of those involved in this adventure have realized that the blockchain is a weapon designed to destroy banks and non-representative governments.

not sure, it's something he told me in a skype call, I do know it was a joke on the rest of the frat houses and not a registered frat. Satoshi is many things, a doctor, lawyer, inventor and computer scientist. . Here is a website he created, XENU.ORG, but like I said you will never find him, he has many layers of deception in place to foil investigators. His first name is John but he never uses it.

Congratulations, so wow, maybe see you @ decentral tonight? In case your wondering who I am check this definition our glorious leaders have come with for Municipality.
“municipality” includes the corporation of a city, town, village, county, township, parish or other territorial or local division of a province, the inhabitants of which are incorporated or are entitled to hold property collectively for a public purpose;
That's how they steal your property rights.
This is how the gain your servitude. The lovely Act of Law is found in the Financial Administration Act. Funny enought its found in the section titled "Public  Money" 
Marginal note:Charges for rights and privileges
19.1 The Governor in Council may, on the recommendation of the Treasury Board,
(a) by regulation prescribe the fees or charges to be paid for a right or privilege conferred by or on behalf of Her Majesty in right of Canada, by means of a licence, permit or other authorization, by the persons or classes of persons on whom the right or privilege is conferred; or
(b) authorize the appropriate Minister to prescribe by order those fees or charges, subject to such terms and conditions as may be specified by the Governor in Council.
This is why crypto is so important, it removes this bullshit central authority and puts the power of currency on a peer to peer basis. We are the money and they stole that from us via legislation.

Satoshi talking about the past, present and future, He knows whats coming, he engineered it. Pay careful attention, Satoshi has many wonder filled inventions on the way. My understanding is Ethereum is the future of the blockchain, Satoshi is quite happy the DEV team behind Ethereum see's the potential of the bitcoin blockchain to disrupt and decentralize the choke points for information and commerce.

Satoshi is in fact Scottish, the block chain we hash is also the creators Gnome. he chose to embed his Gnome into the blockchain to prove he created it. Satoshi also created Anon, there is a bigger picture at play here and none of you see it. The blockchain is a weapon, it was created to destroy the Banking industry and Governments. It's purpose is to put the power of p2p commerce in the hands of humanity. Satoshi was raised in Canada and educated at Berkley, you will never find him

The States Parties to the present Covenant,
Considering that, in accordance with the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,
Recognizing that these rights derive from the inherent dignity of the human person,
Recognizing that, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his economic, social and cultural rights, as well as his civil and political rights.
The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights set forth in the present Covenant.
Where in Canadian law do they ever use the words man/woman, nowhere, you will find PERSON, CITIZEN, TAXPAYER and other legal entities but you will never find a man or woman obligated to the state written into the law, legal persons is how they ensnared you into servitude. Your brain is such a slave to the state that you will argue otherwise, pretending to be free.

why would you pay taxes on receivables? The whole purpose of Satoshi's creation was to kill the war machine and remove 3rd parties. If you have declared to the State you have bitcoin you are a fool

Fuck Canada's laws. You seem to miss the point of disruptive technologies, distributed networks and peer to peer exchange, why invite money pedophiles into your life?
@_date: 2015-10-16 11:54:25
the law says yes, fuck the law, how are they to know unless you disclose it. Those cunts will steal it from you and call you a crook.

Odds are a Lawyer came up with that, those fucking weasels want a Tender for Law on the air we breath. 
I'm looking forward to the day they drop from the sky like that rash of Banksters a while back. 
Bitcoin is the shot across bow, Smart Contracts the swans song.
