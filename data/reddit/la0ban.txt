Directors will be opening themselves up to personal liability under Hong Kong law if they rush to release deposits at this time.  Creditors will certainly petition to appoint a receiver and liquidate if this is rushed. I have sent an email to your inbox as well.  Please respond.

Bitfinex was offering services to US customers: they operate in the US market and are thus subject to US jurisdiction.  The real issue is enforcement: what can the US do to a HK company in HK to make it comply?  Bitfinex clearly thought it was worth the penalty to not have to deal with.

In the thread I believe there is an attempt to negotiate and $200k is politely asked for, inviting a discussion about compensation.  Not only is this rejected by Star, but the entire concept of settling is as well.
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:48:57
I don't say this as intending any to disrespect he has way more integrity than Star.  He ran Bitcoin's first exchange and, well, shit happened.  He could have done better, but OKCoin is now the largest exchange and isn't even trying to learn from what happened.

Say it right, it was "China King of Bitcoin".

Do note that OKCoin released this first at their blog.

You can't judge a lawyer's integrity solely based on a client they had.  Everyone is entitled to representation.  
@_date: 2015-05-23 05:37:20
If OKCoin signed the agreement and didn't provide an out that's on them and there was likely value provided for that.  We can't really assume details of the deal.  This clearly wasn't an agreement written by a lawyer, perhaps OKCoin should have insisted on one.  In any event, I'm sure emails between the parties will surface to make the terms clear.
@_date: 2015-05-24 03:55:40
Simple testimony from the OKCoin representative who signed the document would clear this up nicely.  And with OKCoin's blog saying he is being looked into for misconduct (see  we can fairly surmise he has said he didn't sign v8.

Singapore law is derived from English common law.  Very business friendly.
@_date: 2015-05-30 08:25:39
Thanks for coming forward about this.  You have done not only the community a favor but Star as well, since it appears he was on track to become the Mark Karpeles of China.

Roger's alleged history has nothing to do with the agreement, and OKCoin presumably knew about any of those things beforehand.  Why do they get the right to cancel an agreement in that case when the agreement doesn't allow that?  If anything it looks like OKCoin is just broke and can't pay.  
@_date: 2015-05-24 03:53:08
This is exactly what it looks like.  Sometimes you have to stand and fight even if just to prove a point.
@_date: 2015-05-24 04:10:46
One sided?  If so why did OkCoin sign it?  Presumably they were enticed by placement of ads for themselves, promotion of their new international platform and favorable payouts on ad revenue.  This contract is not "unconscionable"--those agreements come into play where you have two parties with unequal bargaining power (e.g. bank and a farmer).  OKCoin is not some disadvantaged party being offered a take-it-or-leave-it contract for money they need to survive.  
@_date: 2015-05-25 19:38:00
And even in the revised v8 OKCoin still breached by giving no notice.  They lose either way.

In light of the Ripple fine and rumors surrounding the reason for the fine, we are uncomfortable sending to a bank account in your name. Is there another party that we can send to?

 Jack,
I’ve CCed the lawyer representing me in the Ripple situation.
Brian Klein is a former federal prosecutor, and one of the top lawyers in the Bitcoin space.
If you have any questions about the Ripple situation,  he will be happy to answer them.
However, what you are asking me to do in your email below is the very definition of money laundering.
(Sending to someone else’s account other than the actual recipient.)
Please honor your signed contract, rather than playing games with me.  I’ve attached my wire details gain for your reference, as well as the original signed contract.
There are a minimum of 55 months remaining in the contract, meaning OKCoin will owe me a minimum of $550,000 USD more over that period.
I don’t want to have this sort of email battle every month for the next four and a half years of my life in order to be paid on time.
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation,
Roger Ver
@_date: 2015-05-24 04:03:36
You don't have to enforce contracts in your home country, that's irrelevant.  Singapore and China clearly have jurisdiction and both would recognize Roger as a party with standing to bring an action.
@_date: 2015-05-24 11:51:50
The emails contemplate liability in Singapore, not China.
@_date: 2015-05-24 04:02:37
There are grounds for enforcing this in Singapore.  This is in response to OKCoin releasing these details first on their blog. Should Roger have just said nothing?  Now everyone knows what kind of a business OKCoin is.   
@_date: 2015-05-24 06:29:41
The situation you described is not the same as what I stated above--you are now judging an attorney based on actions and not simply based on a client.  But in any event, while the propriety of the lawyer's actions in situation you describe may depend on the details of the so-called "clients fraud", sending cease and desist letters hardly amounts to breaking the law.

As someone who worked with Roger as his attorney and had insight as to what happened, let me offer this: Roger hired on an hourly basis his friend, and trusted him to design, build and be in charge of developing bitcoin.com.  personally charged over $40k USD during the course of 4 months to produce the current site, quitting the project around a month ago before work was completed. To be fair, there are backend portions of the site that are not apparent to the user that raised the price tag, but nothing personally made was ultimately usable.    As someone who worked with previously, I will also say that this is the second time this year he has ripped off a company/friend for tens of thousands of dollars only to leave with no explanation why.

Ben Lawsky should run for office in New Jersey, New Yorkers finally have a reason to move there because of him.

Paging I believe he was hired to design and build bitcoin.com.  How much did you charge for this?  Will you be issuing a refund?

No offense taken, even good analysis will sometimes produce false positives.

I think you fail to grasp the difference between private agreements and social contract theory.  OKCoin agreed to do something and is being held to their agreement.  The state alleges people agree to the state's terms based on "social contract theory", that simply by being born/present under the state's jurisdiction you agree to the state's use of force against you.  Here, OKCoin was never forced to sign an agreement, they chose to give Roger this remedy by signing. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 15:22:17
I'm more disturbed that the person who posted this confused voting against something and having not cast a vote.  That's a pretty important detail.

Olivier's headline was "The Truth About the Bitcoin Foundation". What was sensational was the revelation that the Foundation is firing/"losing people to attrition" because it is basically broke, which was being kept a secret.  If Patrick Murck had reported this to us it would still have been sensational.
@_date: 2015-04-07 07:42:45
This document reveals the Foundation intended to create a new organization to control core dev and then simply sell seats on that board to the highest bidder: "NewCo will be structured to specifically meet the needs of the highest value contributors in terms of oversight of their funds, most likely through direct board representation".  This plan represents a take over attempt of core dev by the Industry members at the expense of the Individual members.

How would you know if the story is true or not?  Were you at the board meeting?  I think you have to actually win the election before they let you attend those.
@_date: 2015-04-09 15:00:02
Title is misleading.   Jim and Olivier did not "vote against" releasing the minutes, they didn't vote.  Elizabeth clearly says "Jim Harper and Olivier Jenssen did not vote and have been tallied as abstained."  How about releasing the redacted version so we can see what is really going on?
