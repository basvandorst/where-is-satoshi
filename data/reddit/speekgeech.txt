I think the tax rates may be slightly different than on the equity market. Best bet is to look up how shorting gold / silver / other commodities are taxed.

Don't forget that the US government actually owns a lot of Bitcoin thanks to confiscation.

Ah, ok! I wish stats on number of individuals invested were available too -- but it's the nature of a decentralized beast not to know :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:51:43
Yup, same as in the stock market. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:53:14
I wouldn't worry too much if I were you. Obviously report gains at time of sale (if you aren't a hodler). But tax-wise, at 19, I doubt you are in a high enough tax bracket to worry all that much :)

This guy knows
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:24:46
Yup. I wonder how that works if you use your girlfriend's account from a tax perspective -- I would look up IRS gifting rules and whatnot. You wouldn't want to somehow get double-taxed!
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:06:22
A little off the mark. The entire document you posted talks about how purchasing in Bitcoin is like purchasing using real property (gold, silver, house, etc). That results in a tax liability always. 
The question you pasted should have been worded more clearly -- I think it's supposed to be geared towards a recipient's tax treatment though (not if you are the buyer paying in bitcoin). Personally, I would just refer to IRS guidelines on bartering. That exactly how they are treating purchases in bitcoin and it is much less opaque. Hope that helped.

So, generally speaking, hedge funds and other finance institutions have their hands tied for legal reasons. Many hedge funds of size are funded by the big money players in finance (i.e. pension funds, insurance companies who have made a killing on premiums, university endowments, the like). This is the lifeblood of hedge funds. However, big money players have a lot of restrictions on what types of assets they can deal with. You wouldn't want to pour the collective retirement funds of California's teachers into untested waters cause you would just get slaughtered afterwards, possibly thrown in jail. Big money has a crap ton of standards you have to abide by (only stocks of companies above $X market cap or with X.X beta). Hedge funds have to abide by those standards or have their funds pulled out. So, most of legitimate and actually large high finance couldn't join the team HODL because the investment didn't meet the standards required to keep the sweet sweet $$$$. That said, CBOE / CME moves are a big deal because BIG institutional money can now abide by their mandates and dabble in BTC. I suggest reading [this]( article written by an author who is actually working at a real-life hedge fund (full disclosure: is friend).

Now is low.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:43:58
Maybe split the difference? Put 60% in at current (HODL on tight) and then set a buy limit order for the remaining 40% at whatever dip price your heart desires.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:53:27
Same as with the stock market, treated as cash / gains. If you leave your profit / funds in TD Ameritrade or whatever you might use, it's not "hidden" and ought to be reported. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:36:24
Opens the door to Wall Street involvement. That said, I think there's a strong argument to be made that a mainstream platform hosting a financial-institution-friendly product will cause huge amount of big money to flow in. Lots of financial institutions are in the know but funding mandates require them to stay out unless certain legitimacy requirements are met. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:54:12
Not criticizing, just curious. Where are you pulling this reporting threshold from? Are you talking the Coinbase $20K forced reporting threshold?

Has anyone transferred from Gemini to GDAX before? Is the transfer more or less instantaneous?

Paypal is still tracked by the IRS. It's probably the lowest hanging fruit for average joe tax evasion.

I with you on this. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:45:28
It's very mandate-driven and most hedge funds are not piling into art; the minority are. The average joe only hears about the megafunds which have mini funds for every type of investment. The reality is that most hedge fund money is in public equities or private debt. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:32:32
LMAO dreams come true
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:45:54
Doesn't that just lead to your friends / family owing the IRS a tax liability?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:41:28
I think I know what you are trying to ask. In that case, you probably would follow a FIFO (first in first out) rule. 
So let's say your buying pattern, ordered by time, was like this (random numbers for simplicity):
1. Bought 1 BTC for $10, hodled
2. Bought 1 BTC for $500, hodled
3. Bought 1 BTC for $100,000, hodled
4. Decide to sell 2 BTC for Lambo when 1 BTC = $150,000
Your capital gain would be: 
(2 BTC x $150,000) - (1st BTC @ $10) - (2nd BTC @ $500) = $299,490
Does that help? Not that that matters bc HODL
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:09:25
Minor gripe. Yes, there may be hedge fund purchases going on. No, they are not clumsy or not-subtle. Any hedge fund of size has at least a few dedicated traders whose entire job is to make sure they enter the position they want without raising too many eyebrows.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:45:13
Noticed that too. I think it may be that Gemini just has lower trading volumes overall -- don't think it's a data lag.

So just making sure you have a basic understanding of margin trading to begin with. Let's say you have $100. That allows you to buy $100 in Bitcoin. Goes up 30%. You have made a 30% return and $30 in fiat. 
With margin trading, you are borrowing money (for a fee / interest). Let's say you start over. You still have $100 to invest but you also borrowed $100 for a $5 fee (for simplicity). This allows you to invest $200. Same situation as the previous example. Bitcoin rises 30%. Your total investment is now $260. Return the borrowed money, pay the fee, and you are left with a $55 fiat gain. 
Same $100 in your hands. Without margin, you get $30 in fiat. With margin, you get $55. Better return on investment................ if you make it out alive. 
Leverage, my friend, is just a sexy way of saying debt.
I would recommend margin trading to NO beginner, if that is what you are. Only professional traders or very very experienced amateurs should play with margin / leverage.

There isn't really a reason to buy a "full" bitcoin in a single go. And yes, you can search the subreddit for really great suggestions on exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:19:28
Unless the exchange is based in Korea or Zimbabwe :P

Oh, sad. A day or so is like a year in crypto-time. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:47:52
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:47:03
To withdraw fiat from Korean exchanges, you have to have a bank account which requires a national ID which requires a physical trip to Korea if you aren't Korean (and a long-ish trip too). There's also a limit for taking fiat out of the country. We're all thinking it ;)
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:05:08
What do you mean by the rest of the world LOL
The majority of trading volume is in Japan (btdubs do you think the Chinese government taking a neg stance on Bitcoin = big Chinese money just shrugs? where do you think they went...). Check out one of the big Korean exchanges, Korbit. Their Bitcoin prices are absolutely more crazy than those in the US (I'm assuming most people here are probably in the US). 
Yeah. The rest of the world isn't watching, they are buying in or actually using Bitcoin as a form of payment. Don't forget that!

This needs to be upvoted way more.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:29:48
Since taxes are based on your gains, and you haven't gained much (+ losses offset your tax liability on gains), I doubt you actually have to cough up much cash, if any, for taxes.
That said, recording and reporting all of those transactions if you did trade in-and-out of bitcoin a hundred times would be a massive pain in the ass. Realistically, probably not going to be an issue -- but still. 
If you are looking just for entertainment value, maybe daytrade VIX on a paper trading platform instead? Or add Teslas to your shopping cart and then remove them over and over again?

If it makes you feel better, I can reword nearly all of those statements to apply to those who put money into Tesla's shares. I'm not saying Bitcoin is the most secure ever and that HODLers should forget the moon and ready themselves for intergalactic travel. But, if you reframe the situation around Tesla, having multiple opposing agendas doesn't feel quite as dire. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:54:16
Hahaha, trust me, stockholders and investors are extremely savvy, don't worry. Overstock has experienced a lot more investor interest because they were one of the first to enable Bitcoin payment (and thus have temporary or HODLed coins) and because they literally started a blockchain investment business (Medici Ventures) on the down-low. 
Also, most businesses that have taken payment in Bitcoin convert to fiat on the spot. So it just shows up as cash. For those that hold anything in actual Bitcoin, they are pretty much required to report their on-paper gains. As in, if they are HODLing and haven't traded out, they still report their theoretical gain in the "Other Income" section of the income statement. 
And since gains (from HODLing or from instant conversion) are reported on the income statement, and thus reflected in net income, investors / stockholders who pay attention to quarterlies or annual earnings are well aware at this point. The only scenario in which investors would be taken completely aback by Bitcoins as assets would be at some tiny ass company that has zero analyst coverage that also has decided to go extremely progressive and get into blockchain. First off, tiny ass companies don't often take actions like that. Second, unless a megafund has a dedicated small-cap company mandate, they basically aren't allowed to touch tiny ass companies without breaching their required risk allocation. Usually tiny ass company shares are purchased by tiny ass hedge funds, and those usually don't have enough millions to move the needle, even then. 
Edit: words are hard

For some financial institutions (and those most desperate), GBTC did let them get into the game. But the reality is that most big money is sidelined. 
In any case, HODL on :)
