FINCEN only considers you a MSB if you transact over $1,000.00 per person per day.

Yep, good time to invest in BTC and alts if you want to make even larger gains (check out EOS). Make a coinbase or Gemeni account. You can download the coinbase app - it’s easy.

Just try localbitcoins - let us know how it goes.

Gdax is free - why use things like Coinbase that charge crazy fees?  Do some research

What battle? BCH is a bandaid on a grave wound.  It solves nothing and just creates new problems.  We need to put all of our efforts in getting lightening network up and running.  I'm donating BTC to the cause. Otherwise BTC will be replaced by better products like EOS by June.

You can sell BTC for USD on blockchain.info?

Any non-tech ways to help? For instance, I am a licensed attorney and currently work as an AML compliance officer for a large international bank.  My bitcoin enthusiast friends are forensic accountants, financial analysts, bankers, etc.

Exactly how I feel.  It's not over yet.  I predict 70% drop then true rebound.  So bottom is around 5 - 6k. Personally though, I never sell (shrug).

oh okay, you didn't say that you did it through Coinify.  I don't use that service so I can't help you.  I would say be patient as banking/Bitcoin is slow.

If they did that it would cause the price of Bitcoin to crash, thus they are better off not fucking with it. It's one of the pros of bitcoin. There is an incentive to not mess up the system. It even kind of deters grand theft - if you steal//hack Bitcoin the value of Bitcoin will go down as the trust in Bitcoin will decrease, and as such the thief will be left with worthless coins.

Coinbase is easy to use, based in California, and AML compliant.

Thanks for the link. Which casino did you invest in? Aren't you worried the owner will just run away with your investment?

There are Bitcoin gambling platforms where I could be the house

more likely to be over 2000 in two weeks than 200

Yea, I am close to $300,000.00 in student loan debt.  So need to make moves ASAP.
