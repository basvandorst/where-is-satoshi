ive never had an issue with coinbase once. all my deposits and withdrawals have gone through as expected for over a year. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:39:55
someone is observant and likes the word "salty"
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:00:41
yeah you just figured that out?
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:56:33
yeah i'm always surprised at the amount of time it takes for someone to understand you can buy a fraction of it. just a complete "does not compute" moment. a lot of people are also completely scared of the unknowns of investing. finance and economics is another world. ive been doing it a year and i'm still intimidated by most of it. it doesn't take much though to get your foot in the door and see how it feels. i understand how someone who knows nothing about markets would be completely unwilling to put their hard earned money into something. when you know nothing, it just looks like gambling. if people don't understand traditional systems then there's no way in hell they will touch bitcoin, unless they have technological, economic and/or political interests. bitcoin affects the world in many ways and that's how it keeps drawing people in. it benefits many aspects of society. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:14:20
everything's going to be ok
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:57:09
i'm starting to feel this way too haha
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:42:41
hasn't happened yet so neither manipulation or coincidence 
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:31:17
so what qualities do these consumer reports NOT report on? 
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:39:55
it's funny because bitcoin needs no website
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:08:50
you didn't answer my question. who or what is a good judge of car quality?
if you're saying a tesla isn't "nutritious" or doesn't provide "energy" then that is inaccurate since it does both. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:36:15
because the government and the fed want to maintain control over their system and educating the masses about how it works would be risky 
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:39:23
you're free to post whatever you find interesting 
@_date: 2018-05-02 12:07:38
haha right so i'm asking what you think since you have an opinion on what isn't a good judge
@_date: 2018-05-02 11:05:00
its not "the" measure, but it is one. consumer reports has been testing cars for decades and has become a trusted source for that data. why wouldn't you respect that?
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:02:11
because that's what unintelligent people do
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:20:00
hmm.  cars are made for consumers aren't they? so if customer satisfaction isn't a good measure, what is?
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:51:00
yeah welcome to the world lol

@_date: 2018-05-02 13:26:23
lol no. you said consumer reports wasn't the best judge so i'm curious what you think is. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 10:48:21

what's funny is that you took a comedy show seriously and thought the comedian was coming to "conclusions". don't you realize as a comedian on a comedy show his job is to make jokes?

it's still faster than 3-5 business days, right?
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:29:15
haha he wasn't saying anything that interesting. The point of the post was just to show it was getting exposure on CNBC. They didn't talk about it for long, and he just mentioned that he was investing personal and business funds into it. The anchors didn't seem to take the subject very seriously, didn't ask good questions and moved on quickly.
He also talked about it on CNBC in 2014:

this is dumb. anybody who can read a price chart knows that resistance was exactly where we just saw it top out. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:44:43
i would think this would be a gradual change, as people decide which they want to use based on momentum to either side

that's awesome. this movie reminded me of how exciting bitcoin was before anyone knew anything about it. it's still exciting but now it's different with all the media coverage, derivatives markets, regulated exchanges, political hearings, etc. wild how far it's come. thanks for making something to remind people of the mystery once upon a time. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 08:33:17
what story is it based on?
@_date: 2019-03-17 06:20:33
the potential is what bitcoin is. you have to come to your own understanding of that. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 18:08:23
such catharsis much bitcoining
@_date: 2017-01-10 06:29:23
From what I understand, the entire appeal of blockchain is that it offers digital records unable to be altered. Bitcoin is simply an application of that technology on a large scale.
@_date: 2017-01-21 14:25:49
What's the reasoning behind that statement?
@_date: 2017-01-10 07:44:58
I think the move is shifting though from companies trying to replicate Bitcoin, to understanding the underlying technology enough to find different uses.
I've been reading about this stuff for the last two weeks straight, day and night, but I still don't understand subtle differences. I also haven't been following this for the last year and a half, so I don't know how news like this compares. I just know the DTCC is a monster company and $11 trillion is a lot of money to be playing with.
Maybe the DTCC official announcement has information more to your liking? 
@_date: 2019-03-18 17:02:42
the movie allows the viewer their own interpretation, so that anybody watching can imagine any reason why the main character was excited about investing in bitcoin. it doesn't need to be specifically explained for the movie to work.

they only do stupid things from the consumer's perspective. their ultimate goal is to make profit and they have a never-ending supply of schmucks to fuck over.
@_date: 2017-01-02 03:27:33
that there is comparitively low volume in relation to previous action. i typically interpret it as showing weakness in the trend. could be a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 22:19:01
great point!
@_date: 2017-01-10 07:58:44
haha good point. i guess we'll find out how stupid they really were if and when we find out who makes away with the cash. everybody thought the banks were being stupid and criminal during the housing bubble yet they got away with it. could happen again.
@_date: 2017-01-10 08:26:56
haha no i'm just saying if you have a goal and you achieve that goal then you weren't stupid. if the people at the banks did what they set out to do and make tons of money, then they won.
it really depends on your perspective. different goals for everyone.
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:06:28
actually, i'm more like "this is that moment i was waiting for to buy more with the funds i had ready"

THIRD PARTY EDIT: The price goes up when more people want Bitcoin than is available at the current price.

@_date: 2017-01-08 02:12:16
you're right. that's interesting. could they be blocking a data stream to bitcoinity? or is bitcoinity just not picking it up? thats the only exchange showing a drop.
@_date: 2017-01-10 06:17:11
Technically, the title is the opposite of misleading, since it leads more people to the article. More people know the word "Bitcoin" than they do "blockchain". Standard journalism and news tactics. The article actually furthers awareness about blockchain, just not directly.
You should check out the talk IBM CEO Ginni Rometty gives about how IBM is working with blockchain technology for businesses. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:37:45
that will change as bigger investors consider getting involved
@_date: 2017-01-10 07:19:54
I figured they could apply the same processes Bitcoin uses with the money saved on efficiency, otherwise I'm not sure why they would want to use it. There's a good chance these big companies don't understand the technology yet themselves but are smart enough to see its growing appeal. As Bitcoin continues to spread, and blockchain developments emerge, it will further motivate organizations with enough money to try a new technology. 
You have to figure there is a reason why companies are doing this. IMO, it's all part of pushing scalability. Andreas Antonopoulos himself is consulting for companies, including banks and governments, wanting to utilize this technology, but no paradigm shift is easy. Definitely an interesting and exciting time. A little scary too.
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:09:07
knowing how things work is a wonderful tool
@_date: 2017-01-14 21:25:41
You think the data on sites like CryptoCompare.com are falsified? Or that the exchanges are reporting false data?
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:07:48
your project looks awesome. i loved the first post. the conversation seemed much more civil there. this one not so much haha.
be careful inviting strangers over. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 02:35:26
oh shit good point. how will that work? i've never thought of that. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 21:03:11
Great question. Like they say, "Follow the money."
I think it's probable that China's exchange activity is funded by the government in an attempt to encourage buying. China wants to be competitive while they are "economically liberated", especially in an emerging industry.
@_date: 2017-01-14 03:45:03
@_date: 2017-01-14 03:16:37
Or it will be so hard to mine the last of it, that rumors will have time to build about a final ultimate reward from Satoshi Nakamoto, thus creating the first cryptoreligion. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 17:42:53
Those are all just different drawing tools and formula based indicators which find patterns in the price data. The colored horizontal lines are Fibonacci retracements, which often define support and resistance levels. I noted the different points of contact. I drew a black parabolic curve to show a possible direction based on former price movement. I drew some directional trendlines to display previous trends and rising support levels. The lower indicators are common oscillators using different criteria which display oversold and overbought levels based on previous price action.
I try to be as objective as possible when defining the patterns I see but obviously no one knows the future. What I did is called technical analysis, which I use to supplement the fundamental analysis. Fundamentals include real-world events and technological innovations.
It could take more than a month or less than a month to reach lower levels before continuing upwards again, but I think that time will come. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 15:34:39
Ever since there have been banks we've needed to ask for permission. Paper money does not belong to you; it belongs to the government. It says it right on the bill.
These are the problems bitcoin and blockchain aim to remedy. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 06:22:40
Only if the company wanted to counterfeit themselves by altering their own internal network blockchain which they chose for its ability to not be altered...
It will basically be a small-scale Bitcoin where the company controls all the mining for no one's benefit but the company's. If it was exposed to outside influence, and a big enough mining pool wanted to alter it, then yes, that could happen. We hope the company can still maintain basic network security and quickly discover any outside attempts to alter the chain.
@_date: 2017-01-11 06:41:02
can we unpin this now?
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:02:59
wouldn't you like to know
@_date: 2017-01-10 15:03:26
again, it depends on your objectives. if your objective is to preserve the country then yes the actions are stupid. if your goal is to take everybody's money and run then they did a good job so far. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 06:26:34
What do you mean "typical"? There is no typical hype for blockchain because there has never been a blockchain before to be hyped. Every major development is unique and exciting because it's all happening for the first time.
Also, I think this might be the biggest publicly announced investment into blockchain technology. $11 trillion dollars will be on the line - money directly connnected to Wall Street.
@_date: 2017-01-03 07:22:31
not a good time to buy. wait a month or more.
@_date: 2017-01-10 03:43:42

Yeah, their servers are bloated because of the rally. They tweeted about it yesterday.
@_date: 2017-01-08 16:19:25
hmm yeah thats sketchy. unfortunately, you need to keep keep fighting them on this and find out what's going on. and keep us updated! good luck
@_date: 2017-01-02 15:04:12
Possibly. In either case, the uptrend has been happening for months, which does mean that the buying pressure exceeds selling. That is a good thing. I started looking at bitcoin in October so I don't know why volume was higher 
There's a good chance this is panic buying and FOMO on a small scale, while everyone else holds. There's a small chance this falls to $800 or even $400 in 2017, but I think Bitcoin ultimately will remain in demand. Until another innovation comes along and is tested enough to surpass Bitcoin's usage, Bitcoin will continue to to rise. I think it has enough mass and momentum now to make it difficult to slow or stop. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:40:22
I sold half at $1140 last night and bought back in this morning at $915. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 22:26:18
if you know the trading world and how easily they are swayed by this stuff then you know this is good news for those hoping for wider adoption.
now to see if it gets any traction on the site. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:40:15
i agree with you except about the 3rd world buying. no matter the price of bitcoin people can always put in however much they want. but in general i guess its obvious that lower prices get you more of it. a sale is always good. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 15:55:36
good talk

i was about to spew so much hatred into my keyboard but luckily i learned in 6th grade to read all instructions before beginning.
@_date: 2017-01-10 07:34:52
If banks only care about making money, and make more doing the things they do, do you think they feel they're being stupid?
I don't disagree it is selfish and possibly short-term, but that's how it is. Maybe they're stupid because the end is approaching but until that day comes they can get away with it.
@_date: 2017-01-21 19:43:55
haha brilliant
@_date: 2017-01-10 14:58:55
hmm why do you say that? you seem to have a strong opinion. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 03:12:00
I imagine after all Bitcoin has been mined and global adoption and innovation continue to grow, the miners will be getting fat fees for their work. Plenty to go around, I imagine. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:14:22
better logic than most
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:23:28
let's just hope the government orders some

i wonder how many bitcoins are leaving china during this selloff
@_date: 2017-01-12 00:37:29
haha great scene and great movie. good thing bitcoin has better fundamentals.
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:06:16
i would like to state for the record i have not had any failures with bitcoin. ive bought all along the way and sold for the first time yesterday at the peak (like a boss) and bought back in a half awake scramble at near low (like a boss' boss)
PSA to new investors: someday you can be just like me :)
for donations, i do indeed accept bitcoin. thank you. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:38:16
just buy some now then. buy some like you would've any other time. don't buy so much that it will hurt you if you lose it, but honestly with bitcoin, even pre-spike, that is unlikely. it doesn't look like bitcoin is coming down anytime soon.
you could buy it now on the way up, or buy a dip, but right now you might be safe to just get whatever you can get lol. i would buy a portion of what you can afford now just to kill the FOMO ;) it's possible that it never comes down so any price before then is good!
this spike will probably see an equal fall and most likely resume its more steady upward uptrend, like it did earlier this year between May and August. to compare, buying this "late" in the spike in May would still have made you money today.
@_date: 2016-12-11 15:23:59
"within a year"' =/= "within the year"
i don't know what exact words they used in the video but just in general that's the rule.

@_date: 2017-01-16 17:58:49
this isn't a bitcoin problem. its a drug problem. its bad press for bitcoin but totally negligible. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 15:54:02
that seems realistic yeah
@_date: 2016-12-11 15:53:30
you must be an expert too. i'm also an expert. i say bitcoin will be worth $10,000,000,000 one day. i'm just as right as you because we are both experts.
@_date: 2016-12-25 05:27:06
your kind of thinking ("buy at a bank") is exactly the kind of thinking bitcoin is meant to replace. trusting banks is slowly going obsolete. the blockchain will be the new security we will trust, not banks.
@_date: 2016-12-11 15:21:55
Right. I just woke up, but I think the idea would be that with the common knowledge that there is a limited amount, people will be less likely to lend. There would be a higher risk in securing those loans.
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:17:22
i'm not doing much for security. i don't have a lot of BTC and just like having it. what intentions should i not have? lol
@_date: 2016-12-11 15:15:56
You must be new to the internet. This is what we call "click bait"

@_date: 2016-12-31 16:34:43
how do you figure that?
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:54:21
welcome to the market. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:12:09
Google helps you find any internet content. Government bring you roads and schools. Banks provide lending services.
Bitcoin doesn't do anything. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:59:09
except that cash has reached mass adoption because using, holding, having and "buying" cash is NOT stressful, risky and dangerous, and doesn't take any technological ability to have confidence in.
so, i'm not sure what your point is?
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:19:24
i completely agree haha. i was just thinking the internet is just like a giant city. 
@_date: 2019-09-18 20:07:33
how would they do that exactly? it would have to be very precise
@_date: 2019-09-18 20:19:55
this actually made me happy nervous in my gut cuz it’s so real and true
@_date: 2019-09-18 20:02:19
its not a waste of time if he can find ways to beat the market, even if just in a small community. the learning process alone is worth it at that age. it also depends on his perspective and take. everybody can write an encyclopedia about bitcoin but if he can connect the dots in new ways than he wins.
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:07:08
walking around a city at night with $10k is asking for trouble. storing money on your computer is definitely safer, if you're smart about it.
the other guy said it will never make it. i think it will.

@_date: 2017-06-02 23:07:49
then you should sign up with gemini, send your xrp there, sell it, then wire transfer the money to your bank. there will be some hoops to jump through on gemini, but that's the simplest way. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 15:08:17

go on bitstamp and put in a sell order
