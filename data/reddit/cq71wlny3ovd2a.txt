How do I cash out my tether for USD? I can't seem to find a way to do it. The only way possible is to trade it to someone else but what happens if everyone wants to cash out their tether?

McAfee's prediction is crazy high. Even if Bitcoin replaced gold completely—bitcoin would still be worth less than 400k. I wonder if he is is actually predicting the fall of the USD.

Yup, can't stop looking at how much I'm down on LTC and BTC. (Made the mistake of joining in during the late august early september pump.)

"Stay away from it. It's a mirage basically. It's a method of transmitting money. It's a very effective way of transmitting money and you can do it anonymously and all that. A check is a way of transmitting money too. Are checks worth a whole lot of money? Just because they can transmit money?" Buffett said on CNBC in 2014. "I hope bitcoin becomes a better way to do it. But you can replicate it a bunch of different ways. The idea that it [bitcoin] has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view."
