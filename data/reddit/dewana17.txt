Your better off starting a GoFundMe page then asking for bitcoins no ones going to give you any just because you wrote 3 sentences on reddit , the reason bitcoin exists is because people are distrusting and you only been around reddit for 13 days so .... yeah .....

private keys give you access to wallets , by him holding the private keys he would have access to everyones coins 
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:31:51
What's the fucking website 
@_date: 2018-11-01 18:53:02
First I have to verify all private keys for authenticity purposes,  anyone stupid enough to let you hold all their private keys deserves to be robbed by you

Get yourself a hard Wallet I use the ledger nano , then transfer all your coins into it and hodl to your hearts desire 
@_date: 2018-07-04 00:51:38
@_date: 2018-07-14 23:31:30
I guess the best time to talk about bitcoins would be when you feel comfortable talking about your financial standings together 
@_date: 2018-07-04 16:37:52
I personally use binance for trading and the nano for storing coin I'm not trading
