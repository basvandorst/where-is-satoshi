Just because they are all tanking doesn’t mean that Bitcoin caused the crash.

Why does every other crypto dip when Ethereum dips?
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:29:15
If you look at historical performance, we see a dip of this scale three times per year.

I understood your comment. I was just pointing out that people are relating Bitcoin to Gold like bonds were related to Gold - as you pointed out. You actually misunderstood me. You don’t have to be a jerk about it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:27:55
Luck that nobody is comparing Bitcoin to gold. Oh, wait...

I’d say that is a very small portion of investors. A bank wouldn’t loan a large amount to someone for crypocurrencies, but they will lend large amounts to buy a house.

They should use Ethereum smart contracts so that a third party can arbitrate disputes.

I have the Ledger Nano S, and would recommend it. You won’t save money by getting the BitBox, because you’ll buy something else a few months later.

Pretty sure the bill would be in Satoshis.

Anyone can fork bitcoin. There have been about 900 so far. Best to ignore Diamond, or sell it if anyone will pay some tiny amount for it at some stage.

I have the Ledger Nano S. I found it very easy to use, and seems like the safest solution available. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:21:22
Seems pretty far fetched. I suppose a sex offender list could be placed on the Blockchain.

That article is bad and you should feel bad for posting it.

It’s hard to time the market during a good bull run. After a decent period without sustained growth or with negative growth, the sentiment will be reversed and people will be talking about how well they’ve done by trading rather than hodling.

It isn’t profitable for you to mine bitcoin. You want to buy some. I’d suggest diversifying between Bitcoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash. Go to r/bitcoinbeginners.

I don’t think he understands how Reddit works either.

The company needs profit to maintain the app. You could create a smart contract structure on Ethereum to give a small cut to the developers. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:17:23
Sunday. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:19:43
I suggest that you diversify every couple of months. Bitcoin might win the crypto-wars, but Ethereum or something else could one day be worth more. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:12:15
Bitcoin just isn’t ideal for applications and small transfers. Other coins are better designed for that purpose.

6% per year sounds pretty good until you consider 3% inflation. Your income and savings will slowly decline if you need that 6%.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:59:39
You’d probably want to stage the sell over about a month. That’s a lot of hypothetical coin!

A private key is the password that allows a bitcoin to be spent (transferred from your address to somewhere else). If you don’t own the private key, you don’t own the bitcoin. Some exchanges will promise to support both forks, while others won’t. If you want to be certain that you will get both coins after the fork, you should make sure you have the private keys associated with your bitcoin (i.e. store your bitcoin in a wallet where you have access to the private key). If you haven’t used a wallet before, I suggest you do some research - there is a wide variety, and some are more secure than others.

The total value of BTC + BCH went up immediately after the fork, but not by an amount unusual for a day full of news and speculation. The value had stagnated in the weeks prior. Maybe people were putting their coins into cold storage or being more careful. After the fork there was a lot of guessing as to what each coin was worth.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:57:01
Nobody cares about Bitcoin Gold. It is a scam. SegWit2x is the fork being discussed here. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:30:27
There is no free money in bitcoin. When a crypto forks, the value of the original coin is split into two competing currencies - one will generally dominate.

More useful in 2010, but still useful now. You might say, you haven't missed the boat. ��

Goldman Sachs' net worth is more than ten times the total market cap of Bitcoin. They have the ability to entirely change the cryptocurrency market, so I wouldn't dismiss them...
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:07:57
Surely Bitcoin Platinum is on the roadmap?

Amazon to Australia has actually improved a lot lately. I recently bought something which was delivered in about a week with $10 delivery.

I didn't mean to imply it would be halved. In fact, I suggested that one coin would dominate. Assuming you own the private keys, you will certainly have one of each coin after the fork. If the two coins were certain to be worth more after the fork, you could make a fortune betting all your earnings on it. Unfortunately, this is not the case.

If there is $75 trillion (USD) in world currency, divided by 21 million bitcoins (eventual supply), then approximately $3.57 million per bitcoin.
