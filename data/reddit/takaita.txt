Banks are crooks, I agree with that. At least you know who is the bad guy. With bitcoin one does not even know. 
The concept of 'wealth' is really nice, but in the real world it is about power, and wealth (as in posessing number of units of 'btc', 'gold', 'dollar' whatever) is just a means for getting/maintaining power. I am quite sure that those with the most bitcoins will find a way to get even more at the cost of those with less bitcoins. Not the ways that the banks use, but there will be totally other ways.

I would like to add that it is of couse a good thing that the smartest and most ruthless people have or get hold of most of the bitcoins. Because that is actually good: progress comes from such peeple, and we shjould not even want to stop them.

Credit card companies need the law to be able to force people to pay back. The law wants to be sure that the credit card company only does legal claims, which means state inspection. Also the credit card company needs "unlimited" resources: it will want to serve many people. Therefor it needs to borrow btc from various resources, which means it will offer some interest in return. In short, there you have a bank, keeping a registration of debts and credirs of various people. That bank needs to be trusted, or people would not use it. A trusted bank can and will create some kind of currency, simply by having an administration of debts and credits.

It is possible of course. Controlling the network connections of a bitcoin client makes it possible to have that bitcoin client believe it received valid bitcoins.
The validation of bitcoins depends on validation with the blockchain. Create a fake blockchain and anything can be validated. The fake blockchain needs to exists only for a limited period of time.
@_date: 2014-03-24 15:20:51
Bitcoins are not 'stored'. You can hide a key to a wallet, but that does not make the bitcoins invisible or unfindable or 'stored'. It is only that one needs a key to make them move. If you have the key, you have the bircoins. If you have the key, you are supposed to be the owner. There is nothing else to prove that you own the bitcoins. 
There is actually no owner. The concept of 'owner' is not really relevant with Bitcoin. There is no established way to prove that somebody owns a certain amount of bitcoin or that somebody else owns them now.
And that ultimately leads to the conclusion that bitcoins can not be stolen.
@_date: 2014-09-10 16:50:17
That would beat the purpose of btc. It would be a credit system like we have now. At first it would be anchored to the bitcoin, buf later that 'gold standsrd' would be abandoned. A credit system means that money is being generated from nothing.....

Banks are regulated a bit stricter then before. Not enough though. I agree. It will never be perfect.


Yes Bitcoin is scarce. So the easy thing to do if one has a considerable amount (percentage) of bitcoin is to keep them out of roulation. Then the BTC in roulation will be lower, BTC will be scarcer, value goes up. 
It should actually be the other way around: money should decay more, money should inflate more. It is a wrong position that physical 'goods' decay (slower or faster), but that 'money' does not. Money should decay too. That makes it harder to simply pile up value and make it even increase in value (deflation). In order to have a flourishing economy, people should spend, not save. Inflation is an incentment to spend. 
But actually there is no reason to worry: an inflationary currency will 'win' from a deflationary. Because people will spend the inflationary currency and sit on the deflationary. So the latter is used less and less. Compare it to what happened with the golden standard. It was abandonned, because gold could not keep up with paper money.
You might want to change that. But it is like water running downhill. It will not run uphill. That is a natural law and it can not be changed at will.
@_date: 2014-03-25 09:21:22


Currency is not a 'bet'. It is a means to ease exchange of things (goods, services, information, whatever it is people want to exchange)
When currency starts to be something that can accumulate and make some people rich and others poor, then it starts to miss its point.
Currency should not be something to accumulate, keep and save in the long term. Well, it can happen and as such it is not immediately bad. But when it starts to be the main purpose, things really go wrong.
And actually why should anyone's inactive 'savings' be guaranteed to not lose value in time. If a building is not maintained, it breaks slowly down and loses value. Food rots away in time etc. Nothing is forever. Why must 'savings' be forever? It would be nice. But it is not like somebody else steals from you when savings lose value in time. 
Anyway, we have probably fundamentally different views about values, savings, currencies. In my opinion you put all the blame on 'the banks', where it is just a natural process. Okay, banks play it in such a way that the natural losses are being paid for by the common people. That should not happen. But you can not blame the banks for the general process. 
Bitcoin is a different process and it allows the 'crooks' to play the game in their advantage too - it just has different rules. And what is worse: there is no control, no regulation, so that makes the game even easier for the 'crooks'. They will make sure that the common people have nothing and they have it all.
Stealing Bitcoin is sort of legal, because there is no way to prove that the Bitcoins were yours in the first place and there is no way to prove that you do not still own them.

An anonymous currency is only good for anonymous transactions. 
For many transactions evidence is desired. If I pay for something and the other party can say that there is no evidence that *I* paid, there is no obligation for delivery. And I am left empty handed.
So it is a nice effort, but you must also find something make payments provable.

It is funny that the definition used to call Social Security a ponzi scheme, makes Bitcoin nothing but a ponzi scheme. Remember that social security actually helps people.

There is not so much to say about Bitcoin in the long term. It is nice that you will keep your 2 BTC out of circulation for a long long time. It is a good illustration for how useful BTC actually is at the moment.

There are only two ways to get a decent amount of BTC: buy them or mine them. 
I tried other ways, but they are not worth the effort. Bitvisitor is a great site, but not for earning an interesting amount of BTC (it got me 5 mBTC or so, which is a lot of 5 minutes) . And no, I haven't tried selling anything - mainly because I have nothing to sell.
Basically, you can buy BTC or you can mine them. Miners sell their newly created BTC to those who want to buy them And why do people buy? To save them for later, as an investment.
Miners also are the only people who actually spend BTC. Buyers do not spend their investments (that is not what one does with an investment). 
But anyway: more miners do not make more  new bitcoins, The only conclusion from the slowly falling price is that people have a decreasing will to invest.

Dollar bills have serial numbers. Theoretically each bill can be tracked as it goes from owner to owner. The serial numbers are especially there to enable that. Ownership of dollar bills can be established.
And this is apart from ownership of bank accounts (which is much better comparable to a BTC wallet then individual coins or bills). There is no bank account possible without legal owner.
So my point is that the bitcoin wallet is anonymous. Of course it is possible to adopt an authority which will create a legal document about wallet ownership. But that seems to beat the purpose of bitcoins: adopting a central authority.
I am not expressing an opinion about this. Just stating that "ownership" is very unclear.

How would a mortgage work in BTC?
Say you have a 1,000 BTC mortgage and the house is valued at 1,500 BTC.
Then after 10 years, your house is valued at 500 BTC, you have paid 500 BTC of the mortgage, and you end up with having less in value then when you started.

Although it is an interesting thought, it might be better to stop caring about the price in USD. Just set a price in BTC, because - as the USD is dying as you said - it does no longer really matter.
@_date: 2013-07-02 14:39:04
Maybe, maybe not. I admit to some speculating. The main point is that there are only two ways to get a decent amount of bitcoins (buying or mining).
Of course you might say that some people can have bitcoins from selling or working. But that is only very few. The market for paid work in bitcoins and selling stuff is really very small. 
And buying bitcoins is nice, but if you do that because it opens up the possibility to buy stuff which you otherwise can not buy, then I am very curious what that might be. It is much easier to get something, anything with dollars.
So spending bitcoins is a hobby: just trying out what is available. Nothing wrong with that. 
edit: of course spending bitcoins is often a political statement. Nothing wrong with that either. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 19:06:12

The interesting thing is that it is paired with a lot of bitcoin propaganda (right here at reddit).
