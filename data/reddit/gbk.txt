Unfortunately it does seem like payment processors will pay some role in the Bitcoin ecosystem but the difference between Visa/MasterCard/Paypal and Bitcoin would be that those private companies use private networks/protocols while Bitcoin is public and open source.

Coin base is a wallet. When you purchase bitcoins they sit there until you transfer them out. Please, please read about how to properly secure your wallet before starting.

Why not just leave the last item until it gets knocked down. That might encourage more bidders to try to replace what's there versus a boring default message when queue is empty. Also you can try some fun stuff like .00001btc per minute or something, when the btc run out the next highest bid goes up for his number of minutes.

No, the phone application is a "light client" and not a full node, meaning it just sends your transaction over the Bitcoin network and does not need to process other transactions.

Of course but majority buy on exchanges especially for large amounts, and the IRS will want proof you still hold those bitcoins or subject you to the taxes. Of course there are billions in undercovered taxes so it's up to the individual if they want to risk going head to head with the irs. 
States are already charging localbtc sellers for not filling as money transmitters as well.
@_date: 2017-09-10 03:59:17
When the IRS audits you, you will need to provide the actual paperwork for the purchases that confirm the dates and prices. They will have info from the exchange as well. If you then want to commit fraud with fake receipts it's up to you but they will check with the places you claim to have made transactions. It's still the early days of taxing crypto but IRS does not leave money on the table and they are good at their jobs plus you can end up in jail for tax avoidance.

Note: The Regulations on the Establishment and Operation of the Deposit Protection Scheme have been amended on 24 July 2009, in accordance with which the following changes were introduced:
- The maximum amount of compensation per depositor per bank has increased from €20.000 to €100.000
- All currencies of deposits are now covered whereas before only the currencies of member states of the EU were covered
- The coinsurance has been abolished and, therefore, claims up to €100.000 are fully reimbursed (whereas before only 90% of the claims was covered)

You can run the bitcoin-qt or other software locally or leave wallet management to web based wallets like blockchain.info. For long term storage its probably best to keep majority offline in a cold wallet or paper wallet and back that up.
you can print paper wallets at bitaddress.org and store it safely, sending money to the address while protecting the private key. Later on you can access the private key by importing it into wallet software or blockchain.info.

I feel that the larger long-term balances should be stored offline in a paper wallet. You can generate one with bitaddress.org and print it out and/or store it in a TrueCrypt archive on a thumb drive.
If you are extra paranoid you can save the bitaddress.org webpage and open it offline on a machine booted off a clean Linux bootable live cd and print it or copy it to the flash drive from there. Note down the public address as that is where you will send deposits and you can keep track of the balance using BlockChain.info. When you need to access it you can load the private key into a a web based or local wallet software, send some of it and send the balance to a new paper wallet created in a secure manner as before.
You can keep a copy the of the paper wallet in a safe deposit box or somewhere physically secure.

It's good but make sure you have a backup strategy in place. If the website does not have a way to reset the 2-Factor then you must back up the initial Key(or QR code)  you entered into authenticator or you will be locked out. A paper printout is safest.
If the website has 2-factor reset option then make sure the reset methods are not easily guessable. 
If you back up your iPhone to the cloud, enable 2-Factor for your Apple account as hacked accounts can be used to load your Authenticator and codes onto a new phone.

I think Bitcoin will end up being a back end system and smaller transactions will happen within Bitcoin based payment processors own servers. For instance a customer and a merchant will both have a Bitpay or other 3rd party wallet and the transaction will not need to hit the blockchain. This allows it to occur instantly.

You're right and error checking should (and I think is) done by all clients/websites. The op's idea is good for other reason's though, if you are copying an address from one source to another, match the color code can help you avoid accidentally sending btc to the wrong place.
I would relate this to pulling a credit card out of your wallet where you have several to choose from, typically you do not read the number on the card to differentiate but visually make sure you have the right card.
Additionally, patterns can be incorporated into this to make it easier on the color blind, similar to [identicons]( I see that  [btcaddr.me]( is mentioned which implements this.

Pushtx is for submitting raw transactions instead of using a client. This has nothing to do with speeding up confirmation, that you just need to wait on.

    3. You are not printing the deposit slip, they provide information you use to fill out a deposit slip at the bank.
The deposit will have some 1-4% of 'fees' added on that include cents and you must deposit the exact amount. 
The service works great, USD in the acct shows up in under 30 mins. The only downside is they have slightly higher avg prices than MtGox since their market is less liquid and moves slower.
