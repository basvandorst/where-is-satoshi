Know exactly where you are coming from LOL. Been here for many years under another name. I'm just at the start of a long process - slowly spreading the word. The Satoshi-Awards is in fact just an indirect way of getting crypto to sit around the same table and (hopefully) start formulating a combined strategy to contribute and influence the coming wave of regulation. I suspect that 2018 will be the year in which the outline of crypto regulation will be formatted and since we're so divided we are not giving any input, which is idiotic.  The Satoshi-Awards is the only way that I can think of to motivate cryptos to come together.

I agree to preach to the converted is a waste of time. To ensure media coverage we’ll have to bring in media stars from outside crypto. You’ll see here:  - Stars: “… Movie/Video/Pop Stars to attract more media coverage.”
*“What would the award categories be?”*   
There’s a  number of suggestions there – You’ll enjoy the last one. The Crypto Council will decide on the actual categories. 
Everyone paid in Crypto – that’s for sure!

LOL. Im sure Bitcoin will clean up most of the awards in any case. The Satoshi-Awards is in fact an attempt to get us past the tribal divisions that make us an easy target for finance/gov's. It is  an indirect way of getting crypto to sit around the same table and  start formulating a combined strategy to contribute and influence the coming wave of regulation. I suspect that 2018 will be the year in which the outline of crypto regulation will be formatted and since we're so divided we are not giving any input, which is idiotic.  The Satoshi-Awards is the only way that I can think of to motivate cryptos to come together.

LOL - That was meant tongue in cheek. Obviously some payments will have to be in fiat :( See [crypto-council] ( - Establishment Fund: 






Any other question much appreciated :)

Crypto OSCARS all over TV/media?
Wouldn’t you love to see the Top Crypto Stars, Coins and Ideas rewarded in a star studded ceremony. Promoting Crypto to the world – all coins win! Mods please note: It’s a NON-PROFIT to be run by the Crypto’s themselves. NO SCAM. Have a look at satoshi-awards.com and comment on the website or here if the idea has value or has flaws? I will hang around for some hours to answer questions.

Hi Slardy - You think it's BS? Crappy idea? Just curious - why? Obviously something wrong with how I promote the idea.

No joke. Crypto has been very kind to me. Retired last year. This is my attempt at paying back. Starting a long process...The Satoshi-Awards is in fact just an indirect way of getting crypto to sit around the same table and (hopefully) start formulating a combined strategy to contribute and influence the coming wave of regulation. I suspect that 2018 will be the year in which the outline of crypto regulation will be formatted and since we're so divided we are not giving any input, which is idiotic. The Satoshi-Awards is the only way that I can think of to motivate cryptos to come together. Even if that does not work, it will still be an excellent (and fun) way of spreading the gospel to the 80%+ who've never heard of crypto.
