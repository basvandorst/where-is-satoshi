that's a nice quote but bitcoin unlimited is more decentralized than bitcoin core. with core, the block sizes are centrally planned, with bitcoin unlimited the nodes get to decide how big of blocks they are willing to accept.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:56:15
what does that prove?
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:50:16
this information has been out in the open for years

when will the lightning network be ready? from my understanding, it's not ready now and the soft fork of segwit would leave us waiting... leave people like me still waiting for smaller transaction fees while I get raped.. i've probably spent atleast one hundred dollars in transaction fees in the last couple months..
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:33:35
most of the people on those sites are betting 20 dollars. a 1.50 transaction fee is huge for them. it's already hard enough to overcome the betting juice. now they're pretty much forced to keep their money on the site instead of taking it out and putting it back in.. that wont last.
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:12:21
I don't see why not. it solves the biggest issue we face at the moment and doesn't have any centralization risks. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:58:26
omfg that's not true at all. bitcoin unlimited is basically what we run now but with the ability for NODES (the average person) to decide what size block they want to run. if we all agree we want 2mb we will move to 2mb blocks. in the future when we're needing 4mb blocks we will move to 4mb blocks without having to go through this fucking problem again.

@_date: 2017-03-24 09:02:39
ok... but these channels will have to take place on a hub. who is going to run these hubs? will they be anonymous? 
is this lightning network open-source?
@_date: 2017-03-26 09:33:17
it'd help when it's ready... it's not near being ready though.. and how exactly does it work? does nitro and I need to be on the same lightning hub? it hasn't really been explained in a layman's term type of way.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:02:01
it's not right. nobody needs to quadruple their ram for a 2mb increase. 50% of the nodes will not be lost. It costs 50 dollars for 8gb of ram nowadays, nobody will even need to upgrade because everybody has 8gb nowadays... but he's being dishonest by making it seem like it's a huge problem, it's not. and then accusing the other side of being republicans and spreading disinfo, that was classic.. what a hack. he even tells people to use paypal if they want a better currency, his intentions are clear, he doesn't want bitcoin to crow as a digital currency which is what the people at BU want.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:59:02
price is the main concern because this issue has the potential to kill bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:54:09

im someone who has no idea how the lightning network works. can you summarize the pros and cons (short and long term) for me real quick? and you mentioned attack vectors, is it possible there could be bugs in the code that nobody knows about?
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:43:25
gold is valued highly because it's rare and useful, jackass. bitcoin is the same, it's rare and useful. sticking with small blocks will make bitcoin useless. high fees will kill bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:00:52
you've been shit posting bitcoin core propaganda non-stop for the past week. give it a break. holy shit your post history is cringe worthy.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:29:06
no. Segwit puts the ability to make bigger blocks in the hands of a few. BU puts the ability to make bigger blocks in the hands of the people (i.e. the nodes).
the "experts" who aren't supporting BU don't want to see the network grow, they want bitcoin to stay the same. bitcoin needs bigger blocksizes if people are going to make daily transactions, the fees are too fucking high.
@_date: 2017-03-27 05:16:24
blocks will be empty when we get rid of the unreasonable small limit that is holding bitcoin back.. it should have been moved to 2mb a year ago.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:46:11
i'm asking you when the lightning network software will be ready..
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:12:57
how do I run a hub and how taxing is it on my computer?
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:49:12
that's not true. nobody is being paid to support BU.. where is the proof of that?
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:12:12
are you not scared about taking transactions off chain into 3rd party networks?
@_date: 2017-03-24 07:43:26
could a lightning network be added to BU?
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:58:11
so why hasn't a developer stepped in and released a client that is a 2mb hardfork only?
@_date: 2017-03-24 07:07:31
exactly why I don't leave my coins on there and get anxious as shit everytime I make a transaction.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:57:23


that's funny because that's exactly what you're doing in this post. you're telling him to not think for himself, listen to "experts". you wrote like 5 paragraphs about that instead of telling him what Core wants and the pros and cons and what BU wants and what their pros and cons are. then you went on to talk about 8mb limits needing quadruble the ram and how they will lose 90% of the nodes to scare him when nobody is proposing that... that's the definition of misinformation and propaganda. 
you should feel ashamed. I hope the people see through your corrupt tactics just like they saw through Hillary Clinton.

I want to know when I would be realistically able to use the lightning network on a website like say nitrogensports.eu
an alpha verson of a client is nowhere near ready.. a BU hardfork would fix my problem the second it forks.

@_date: 2017-03-27 05:40:11
yeah... I wonder which side wants to do that? the side that makes their money from bitcoin being profitable or the side that seems to be okay with bitcoin not growing..


@_date: 2017-03-24 09:26:14
can you explain exactly how someone could control 0.7 percent of hash power and cause that attack every day? 
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:49:21
when will that be? lightning isn't close to being ready.. people like OP and me need bigger blocks now. If Bitcoin Core just updated their existing client to include an option to accept 2mb block sizes all of this shit would be over and they could wait to introduce the lightning network when they are ready..
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:17:37
and where will these transactions be taking place?
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:17:43
what miner problem? the lightning network not being ready is a software problem..
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:48:12
He hasn't caused any damage. who is he attacking and censoring?
The guy wants to create a Bitcoin network that is feasible for daily transactions and that's why he supports BU. He's not trying to destroy BTC, that's what Core is doing.
honestly ask yourself why Core wouldn't step down and accept the BU hardfork (which only changes one small line of code allowing nodes to set block sizes) and then try to implement all of their features of segwit with a soft fork down the line? it's completely compatible but guess what.. it ruins Core's agenda which is to centralize the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:53:09
bitcoin already was useful as fast and cheap transactions until the fees got unreasonable... people want bitcoin because of the anonymity. paypal and visa don't offer that.
i've found it as a reoccuring theme that all of these people who don't mind bitcoin core and don't mind all this drama don't regularly use bitcoin..
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:08:20

@_date: 2017-08-20 23:46:44
nobody but shills thinks they can scale that far with big blocks. quit creating a strawman. 


do you not listen to what bitcoin core is saying about the blocksize? they want to keep it at 1mb indefinitely.


yes, I'm very aware the LN is going to be dominated by centralized hubs.


lol it's not bs. i've had tons of posts shadow banned on this sub. I had to continue a conversation with someone earlier today in PM because my responses were being shadow banned.
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:57:16
why don't you go to the blockstream page and look how many of the bitcoin core devs are on their payroll.
they have a majority voice.
and it's a company that plans to charge people transaction fees for using the lightning network. geez, I wonder why they're obsessed with 1mb blocks. google blockstream liquid.
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:52:12
doesn't sound very decentralized to me..
one corporation (blockstream) controlling bitcoin.. I thought we wanted decentralization?
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:53:11


just lol if you think they will care about your opinion. they'll just censor you and then you'll end up on complaining about bitcoin core. oh and that necessary nor manageable is untrue. do you even use bitcoin? remember how hard it was to make transactions earlier this year? when fees made transactions less than 5 dollars near impossible.. there's no reason fees need to be more than 20 cents, not when there's a coin reward for mining. and the size is perfectly manageable, you're just spreading FUD.


or i'll just use bitcoin cash.. no reason to stick around and use a coin that doesn't fit my needs. see that's the thing, they can brainwash a bunch of people, but eventually there will be an actual market using these coins to buy stuff, it will be hard to brainwash hundreds of millions of people.

it makes them worse because they are spreading lies and propaganda about how anything other than a 1mb blocksize is unsafe. 
^ read that, it's the LN creators, in it they say you need 100mb blocks with the LN to scale to 7bn tx's. you can't infinitely scale with 1mb blocks.
there's nothing wrong with the LN. Blockstream didn't create that. the problem is that they want to keep the blockchain 1mb so that they can force everyone off of it and into their Liquid sidechain where they will be reaping the benefits of tx fees. their goal is to make it so expensive to send a transaction on the blockchain (hundreds of dollars) so that everyone will be forced to store their money off chain as well. if that's the crypto you want, go ahead. but I'd rather have the censorship resistant coin with 100mb blocks and 2nd layers.

@_date: 2017-04-22 01:31:16
the train never left the station if you believe in the future value of bitcoin. buying an s9 now could pay off greatly 5 years from now. either way, you could still profit a couple grand in a year with an s9. much more if you're a college student living in a dorm.
@_date: 2017-04-15 03:53:23
atleast you said pls.. 
I love that you're worried about 32mb blocksizes when we're at 1mb right now. by the time bitcoin gets to 32mb, 128gb's of RAM will be cheap. 


is this assuming people wont buy a 50 dollar HDD? they'll just say fuck it and delete their software?


we're nowhere near being capable to run personal nodes on a network that could handle the entire world. good thing technology improves though. 
also here's an idea, why do nodes have to be personal and private? why can't groups of us get together and crowd source supercomputer nodes that we all will have access too?


if it doesn't make it more valuable why then would people make bigger blocks? are you saying people who want bigger blocks want to destroy bitcoin? do you have any proof of this?
@_date: 2017-04-27 00:48:42


think about that statement.. why would a company that makes money mining bitcoin and selling bitcoin mining hardware want to devalue that coin or their reputation?
@_date: 2017-04-27 01:18:03


well, i'm not saying that.. nobody is forced to mine with their hardware. and if enough people make noise about this, it can be fixed in a firmware update, no?
@_date: 2017-04-15 00:39:22
if you don't have 50 dollars to buy a HDD, you don't have any bitcoin so why the fuck do you need to run a node?
@_date: 2017-04-15 11:14:30
yep. the elimination of current nodes numbers is just assuming people wont/cant upgrade their computer. just like I thought. I assume the number in real life would be closer to under 50%. but then node numbers would grow in the near future when the cost to run a node drops.
and I asked 7 questions. thanks for answering only one of them.
@_date: 2017-04-15 03:40:17
people need better CPUs then. my CPU could handle bigger blocks easily. if we pander to the peasants the network will be technologically held back.
and this isn't like something only millionaires can afford... it's ridiculous to think that a major currency network should be able to be stored on a 100 dollar computer.

most "users" of bitcoin don't make many transactions. there's a bunch of "economic activity" on bitcoin exchanges.
seems like if they wanted to make a soft fork based on whichever chain has the most activity they could collude and any time. doesn't sound decentralized to me..
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:53:00

the adoption part. and the bubble did not burst. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:45:49
it could also die in August. all it takes is a split of the chain and people to be split 50/50. the value of each coin will drop. people will start to sell in a panic and the value will drop even more. they will start buying other coins and whichever starts to rise they will all piggy back on and that will be the death of bitcoin. there's no coming back from that.
I really hope bitcoin makes it to 100k, that will be great. but there's a huge road block in the way and that's developers who are afraid of bitcoin node potentially costing 1k dollars to run. imo that's a small price to pay to support a network that can rival Visa's transactions per second. if we want to be the currency of the world we can't expect to do with shitty ass rasberry pi's and ti-84 calculator nodes.

what is there to trust? there will be thousands of other storage centers. the storage centers can't vote on protocol themselves. lightweight wallets would be able to. a clever tactic to stop people from creating a bunch of "fake" wallets and having multiple votes would be a bitcoin level requirement, anything with less than 0.1 bitcoin doesn't register as a vote.

they would be in 2017, in 2023, probably not. tech gets cheaper as better stuff comes out.
nobody is saying we need 20mb blocks right now anyway. 


because it's the perfect way in for censorship. 
if a government wants to step in they could make laws that if you want to use bitcoin you have to use it through their lightning hubs.. 
fuck that risk. 
I'll only accept segwit with bigger blocks and a future plan for increasing block size. preferably an algorithm that increases them when they get backlogged. I don't want to be forced off the main blockchain.

miners aren't the only people who want to stay on the blockchain. a LOT of bitcoin users want that as well.
@_date: 2017-07-10 03:37:40


I don't know if you're understanding me. in my scenario current listeniing-nodes are essentially changed to storage centers and the software they run decides it's protocols after a consensus of 75% (random number) is made on the light weight wallets, then all the "storage center nodes" would go through an automated update and there blockchain would fork.  there has to be a clever way to prevent sybil attacks, limiting IP address to one vote? maybe making a vote cost money and the pool of bitcoin is distributed like a lottery after wards? who knows..
but there would still be listening nodes and mining nodes. the difference would be that there is now a way for people to vote on the blockchain's protocols without the need for downloading something like bitcoin core or unlimited and storing the blockchain yourself.
that op voting sounds interesting, but it would require you downloading the entire blockchain, am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:14:09


lol.. think about what you just said.
more blocks is basically the same thing as bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:05:39


this is a BS excuse. the majority of the world doesn't have access to internet and computers, where do you draw the line for this accessibility? pandering to poor people who most likely don't even have a stake in the network and holding back the growth of the network for their sake makes no sense.


even if the cost to run a node was $1k that's decentralized enough. every middle class person could afford that and lower class people in developed countries could save up to afford it if they really wanted too.
the thing is 8mb blocks wouldn't even cost half of that to operate a node. $400 would be more than enough. 
8mb blocks isn't going to make bitcoin centralized.
that word gets tossed around so much I don't think half the people know what it means. centralization is like a government, doubling the cost to run a node isn't centralizing bitcoin. 
the nice thing about technology is it get cheaper and better over time, meaning with the right bigger block scaling plan you could actually make it cheaper and cheaper to run a node while increasing the networks capacity.
@_date: 2017-07-10 05:47:50

and what's stopping a government from creating a billion dollar mining operation? proof-of-work isn't... 


what if their hardware is the same hardware you're using? they just have more of it..


sounds like you belong on vertcoin's blockchain. 


and how's that going to happen if a majority of the government runs the listening nodes?

I know it wouldn't accomplish anything now, I'm asking why it's not possible for the this to be coded into the system.
what I'm getting at, is why isn't it written into the code that these lightweight wallets can signal whatever they want (they're not going to actually fork off, they don't store any blocks, it's the data centers that do on this new version of bitcoin, once there's a consensus on the lightweight clients, the rules of the data center are self-updated without anyone needing to manually do it)
this actually allows everyone to vote without the need to run a node, true decentralization. although it could be open to attacks but I'm sure someone more clever than me could figure out a way to prevent that.

"todays node runners" "you'll have 10 or so of those tops"
nobody is talking about forking to 1gb blocks. there's thousands of individuals who could afford to store 16mb blocks, myself included. I'm sure thousands of people would do it to preserve the integrity and security of their cash. 
the point where you'd need to crowd source would be decades in the future when you get to hundreds of mb block sizes. at that point there'd be 2 million subscribers to this sub and much more potential node runners. plenty of people could afford one by themselves. people could also set up non-profit charities designed around creating as many of these storage centers in as many countries as possible for the simple reason of staying free from government. 
saying there will be 10 storage centers tops is ridiculously inaccurate. there will be thousands, tens of thousands, possibly hundreds. 
also if a government wouldn't to destroy bitcoin that's entirely possible to happen to the current network. all that would have to happen is a China making Bitcoin illegal. once all of their mining centers are shut down and the global hashpower drops enormously and the difficulty rate for blocks doesn't adjust for months it'd be impossible to use the network, thus effectively be killed.
and I've talked about governments running nodes and mining operations before. theoretically there's nothing wrong it that as long as bitcoin users still have the deciding vote on protocol. multiple governments would be running these operations, it'd still be "decentralized". we need to plan ahead to moving the power into the hands of users instead of miners because that's the reality if nothing changes.

that "study" was in 2015.. that no longer applies to "existing nodes". computer hardware is cheaper today and it would be MUCH, MUCH cheaper when we actually got to the point of filling 8 mb blocks which would be atleast another 2 years from now.

being irrational is not part of a rational discussion.
the point of keeping the block chain irrationally small is too force users off the chain and onto side chains like Blockstream's Liquid. 
is basically a masked attempt at stealing transaction fees from the miners through the spreading irrational FUD about block sizes. 8mb blocks can easily be handled by entry level consumer hardware and would keep transaction fees at a minimum for years to come, on and off chain.. but shills like you go around making it seem like 8mb blocks would be the death of decentralization, that only data centers could store them.. even though I'd have no problem doing it on my computer.

FINE, be irrationally afraid of the word "government" like some conspiracy theory neckbeard. 
we don't ask the government to run the nodes then.
we run community nodes ourselves. we use kickstarters and fund raisers to raise the money to build super nodes and then run transparent voting polls on websites dedicated to them that only people who invested in the node can use.
now we can safely scale to bigger blocks and the little man still has an equal say.

no. only 7k people run nodes. there's 240k people subscribed to this sub and much more bitcoin users. also out of those 7k nodes how many are ran by the same person? 
If you mean by what we have already, as in the bitcoin network, yes. it is exactly what we have, the only difference is that now everyone would be able to have a vote. you wouldn't actually need to be able to afford to run a node. an 18 year old who works at McDonalds could have a vote because he pays taxes, he wouldn't need to run his own bitcoin node and pay for it with his money.

bitcoin would be the legal tender. it would be worth millions per coin. transaction fees is a governments wet dream for tax. bitcoin isn't going to kill government. humans aren't ready for anarchy. we're 1k years away from that.
if this was to happen we'd need huuuuuuuuge fucking blocks though and governments would probably have to run the nodes too, like 500mb blocks with multiple layers.
people would say "muh centralization" but as long as the nodes run on citizens votes (like what software to run) and the voting system was transparent (you can search and see what everyone voted for to prevent fraud). I'd be 100% fine with governments running the nodes, because in this scenario it isn't a central authority. it's multiple governments and citizens are getting the final say (like voting for president)
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:37:37
what choice would they have? bigger governments would have more nodes, sure.. but you're missing the point. we're not picking a representative to be vote for what software the node runs. citizens are voting and the polls are transparent (I don't think you realize this means everyone can see what everyone votes for).

If a billionaire wanted to change the Bitcoin protocol within a week it'd only cost him a couple million dollars.
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:57:58


it's not though. I already explained to you with cheap nodes it would only cost a million dollars for a 51% attack.


that is not true.. not if governments are running the nodes like I'm saying..


??? how exactly is bitcoin going to redistribute wealth? this is a ridiculous claim.. the only thing bitcoin can do to help them is get rid of their central bank which devalues their currency. but in order for that to happen bitcoin needs to scale to insanely huge blocks..


but if governments are running the nodes it would be perfect because everyone would get a vote and it would be essentially like everyone is running a node..
how do you not see that!?

first of all. the peers that run nodes are in no way equal. you can run how every many nodes you want. I have two. therefore I'm superior to someone who only has one. 
second of all. you can still have thousands of nodes with bigger blocks and it will be just as "equal" as it is now.
you said you'll always root for the little guy..
why did you completely ignore the stat I brought up how half of the world lives on less than 2 dollars per day?
it seems you want the bitcoin network to be some utopia where everyone can afford to run a node. 
that inherently will hold back the network and is physically impossible as half the world can't even afford a phone. 
my solution solves this problem AND keeps the network decentralized. there will be hundreds of governments and hundreds of thousands of nodes.

no it's not. it would require a hard fork for 2mb blocks and segwit as it has been is a soft fork.


that's not true. big blocks solve scalability. if another crypto proves that you can stay decentralized with big blocks (which is very easily possible) that coin will have the same benefits as bitcoin. it really will be an alternative. and it will actually be what Satoshi envisioned when he created bitcoin.


neither are you, then. you haven't said one technical thing in our conversation. I've pressed you on your ideas and have nothing but logical fallacies.


if it's this hard to get it to increase now, why do you have faith it will happen in the future? before people say fuck it and move to another coin.


so do you not have any bitcoin? because you should care about how it's going to scale, you're unreasonably optimistic. it's like you don't realize there's other cryptos.

I'm not saying that..


democracy has never worked because there's no true democracy. 
a fucking transparent internet poll is perfect democracy.
tell me how "power will corrupt" a transparent internet poll. PLS TELL ME HOW


this has nothing to do with what we're talking about.
I already told you countless times there will be no representatives that can be bribed.
explain to me how a system where everyone gets an equal vote on the law of bitcoin will be corrupted? 
how is the deep state gonna pay off 51% of the of a network that has billions of votes?
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:42:15
i'd say blockstream wants to make a profit at the expense of the networks capability while still risking centralization. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:14:32


then why don't we have segwit with 2mb blocks? miners agreed on that a long, long time ago.


I agree it'd never come close to that because at the point transactions fees become double digits everyone will switch to a different crypto. there's no coming back from that. you seem to be ignoring that risk with your "we can fix problems later" there's no later if the userbase leaves. 


this says nothing about why hard forks are "unsafe"


no.. it means everyone will be using a different crypto.
what you mean to say is cryptocurrency on a p2p network where everyone can use shitty 100 dollar computers to run nodes can't function as a cash for everyday use. 
decentralized doesn't mean every poor person can run a node. it means no central authority. even if nodes cost 1 million dollars to run, it can and still would theoretically be decentralized.


are you kidding me? that's not a strawman argument. i'm theorizing and asking you how you plan to scale to infinity with 1mb blocks. 
tell me how it can while transactions staying cheap on the blockchain or admit your wrong. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 01:24:47
I remember I was going to buy some bitcoins when it first started to buy some drugs on the silk road. couldn't figure out how to buy them though, downloaded a wallet and everything. I kept getting linked to stuff where people wanted to me send a western union money order and that sketched me out. so I didn't pursue it. If I did and had a couple dollars worth of bitcoin left over i'd be a millionaire now. I'd also probably have lost the key, let's be real.
@_date: 2017-06-10 08:12:54
bigger blocks..
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:03:15


do you understand how insecure bitcoin is right now with cheap nodes? there's only 7k nodes. and it's very cheap to run one. 
it would be relatively easy for a huge corporation or single rich person to build 10k nodes and pay for an astroturfing campaign to delude the rest of the nodes into running whatever software they see fit.
making nodes more expensive to run increases the security of the network. people have already chosen that they aren't willing to run nodes. it's never going to be a thing every bitcoin user does and it doesn't need to be.
increasing node cost to the point of risking centralization is also crazy talk, as long as it's under 1k dollars which even 100mb blocks would be than the average middle class person can afford it and even the lower class if they really want to.
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:25:58
wrong. it has value because of both. but mainly it has value because people value it. 
you could use a branch as currency and in fact people did in the past. yes a branch from a tree.

no. it makes OP look retarded. you can't group libertarians in with a stupid meme. 
are all feminists retarded because of that stupid wage gap meme? no and that's a meme that gained a lot of traction, it even reached President Obama.
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:16:28
you're naive if you think bitcoin will lead to some governmentless utopia. governments will soon take over mining and potentially nodes in the very near future.
also you're not keeping bitcoin neutral and trustless, it would still be those things. 
ALL YOU'RE DOING IS HOLDING BACK THE TRANSACTIONS PER SECOND. effectively keeping the power of central banks around longer.

@_date: 2017-06-13 19:12:25
ok.. let's look at the internet. the basic infrastructure is the most important part. the lines of cable laid into the ground.
what makes the internet faster? internet routing or fiber optics?

you're thinking of liberalism which is the complete of opposite of libertarian ideology and liberty.
@_date: 2017-06-10 08:28:40
not if bitcoin's price rises because people are actually able to make micro transactions again.
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:15:39
we can stay decentralized with bigger blocks and nodes that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to run. I already told you how.
@_date: 2017-06-25 08:04:18
oh look. another account that is much older than his posting history, and only posts about bitcoin. you have two years of no posting... must have been a lot of deleting.. 
I'm curious. when your PR (astroturfing) firm buys accounts, do they come pre-deleted or do you have to go through every post and do it yourself?
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:54:52
only eugenics are gonna save us. fuck man. idiocracy becomes more of a reality with each passing day. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 22:21:10
ok. but do people actually use the lightning network to make transactions right now. and if they do what kind of transactions are these and who are they in between?
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:59:18
the only logical choice is both. bigger blocks and segwit.
you'll find propaganda in this sub that basically says big blocks are the devil. this is spread because a lot of people stand to profit off of segwit if they keep the blocksize at 1mb.
if the blocksize is kept at 1mb it wil eventually cost hundreds of dollars to open a lightning channel. this means you will be forced onto centralized lightning hubs. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:58:51
minority makes it sound like an ineffectual 10% when it's really some of the biggest names of bitcoin core.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:47:50
everything is lining up for a big crash.
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:23:40
do you get paid by the hour or by the post?
@_date: 2017-06-25 07:37:41


because if the blocksize doesn't increase while the number of transactions grow, the fees will also grow on the block chain. it costs a fee to open up a lightning network channel. if it costs 100 dollars to open up a lightning network channel you will be forced onto a centralized lightning channel where everyone will be able to see your transactions that make while you're one it. 
there's the case, now talk about it.
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:37:51
it will stay neutral and trustless in my given scenario..
tell me how "power will corrupt" a transparent internet poll. PLS TELL ME HOW
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:19:28
that is fundamentally correct. but that's not why you're a shill.
you're a shill because you have been posting about bitcoin 24/7 for the last month on an account that is older but was inactive/had all of it's non bitcoin posts deleted before that. just like all the other shills.
@_date: 2017-06-14 01:00:28
are you kidding me? you're making shit up. of course the miners are going to respect the outcome. it's in their best interest to follow the consensus.

bitcoin core, they want to keep 1mb blocks


this is the problem. the system could "work" with 1 billion users and 1mb blocks and 1k dollar transaction fees. that's not "working" well though.


what is unsafe about a hardfork? 


it will if the block sizes stay the same. 
then you'll be telling me to just join the centralized hub. 


being clever.. like centralized hubs and then they'll communicate on a third layer of centralized hubs who will then communicate on a 4th? is that your definition of clever?
@_date: 2017-06-25 07:35:23
sure but will you still have people using it? if LNs lead to centralized hubs and people don't want that they will move to another crypto and there will be no coming back. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:19:53
so the minority consensus is what is "unsafe" 
not the hard fork. 
there's nothing "unsafe" about a majority consensus hard fork, nothing at all. assuming the code is tested and without bugs, but soft forks could have the same issue.  
a hardfork without overwhelming consensus isn't going to happen, not unless a big mining pool feels the need to split the coin and they'd only do that if they felt bitcoin was being destroyed and they needed to save it. it's in their best interest to keep bitcoin valuable.
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:26:32
just wait till it becomes legal tender and all the mining operations are government ran because they get the cheapest electricity.
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:43:46
sure but I don't see how this isn't the little man taking control of the currency.. right now it's in the hands of privatized central banks that is not government, it's privately owned companies with stock holders. 
it's either this or continually hold back bitcoin's capabilities so that individuals can run their own node.
and you mentioned the little man.. well guess what, the little man is too little to afford a node right now.
it costs a couple hundred dollars to run a bitcoin node.
half of the world lives on less than 2 dollars a day. 
are you rooting for them? do you really want to depend on them independently being able to afford a bitcoin node?
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:17:17
you can have a decentralized network with governments involved.. 
centralized means one or a handful of nodes, and at that point they'd probably be full nodes (mining). 
if we had governments running nodes there could be multiple nodes for every single city. something like one node per 100k people. voting on whatever protocols they want. 
that is decentralization. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:48:16
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:35:41
I don't agree. a second layer solution is a band aid and has very serious consequences of it's own that are largely ignored in this sub.
I don't even think raising the block size to 8mb would risk centralizing the node network. you could build a computer that could handle that size of blocks for under 300 dollars.
again there's only 7k nodes, right? Bitcoin is not some p2p network where 200k plus people are using nodes. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:28:56
what is there to discuss about a block size increase? there's only stalling.
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:20:25
you said a whole lot of nothing. so i'll only respond to the small part that has any relevance.


increasing the transactions per second isn't wasted effort. building more roads and allowing more people to travel quickly isn't wasted effort. building more hospitals isn't wasted efforts.
it's increasing the power and value of bitcoin.. it's cutting down the time of travel.. it's saving lives..
that's the best argument against bigger blocks you have? "eventually those blocks will be full too"???
