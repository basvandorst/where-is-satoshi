No one wants to use Bitcoin. People want to get rich quick. If they wanted to use cryptocurrency as currency they would use a different cryptocurrency. People are not paying the TX fee because the btc network is valuable, they are paying the TX fee because they think the price gain will offset it.

Why would they do that instead of cash settled derivatives? They don't buy gold and they've been cash settling that for decades.

It is different than storing fiat in a bank. It is impossible to steal money from a bank since it is all digital. Any theft or illegitimate transfer is simply reversed. This can't be done with btc

I have noticed a distinct lack of socialism-based technological advancements lately. Everything seems to be granting users more options and control.. When will we see some great technology that hamstrings markets and takes all control away from the individual? Come on guys!

You are not accounting for the infinite possible competitors to Bitcoin. You better divide by infinity to adjust your numbers.

It's nothing like paying taxes. This doesn't involve theft or thugs putting you in jail.

Of course there is reason to leave bitcoin -- profit. If a miner can get higher profit with his equipment on another coin, the miner will switch. and consumers (regular folk) will use the coin that has the best value/risk to them. If one currency is half the cost to get a transaction done, then its a no brainer.

why not? If there is profit in mining and processing transactions, miners will go wherever the most profit is. An equilibrium will be reached in altcoins, and it will not be 100% bitcoin, 0% everything else.

it'd be nice to have 4mil, but a smart person doesn't *need* even a third of that. if you'd like to learn more.

Stacks of coins. Larger than life statements (best invention in the history of the world etc). 
Having a physical coin be the first thing somebody sees doesn't even make sense. It will just confuse the newbie.

Considering it takes at least a few business days to open an account on an exchange, I am going to say "no"

This sounds ridiculous. The government staking a blockchain and buying enough of the coins to fund ubi on the 5% interest on staking. That sounds like it would be severely centralized. Nobody would want to use that coin due to the risk of centralization. Also it means that the government would need to force people to accept their coin as money when people wanted to spend their basic income. But the coin would have no value due to nobody wanting to use it. The value would be derived entirely from thethreat of the government punishing you if you don't use it. Might as well just use Fiat in this case.

Nobody is buying Bitcoin in hopes that it stays equal in purchasing power (a store of value) to when they bought it. Get real man! They want it to go up

So, somebody will go through the effort of verifying the blockchain (through whatever proof is involved) for no reward? Doubtful.
@_date: 2018-07-16 00:20:33
You are suggesting that someone who stakes 1coin gets the same reward as someone who stakes 100coins? Why would anybody stake 100 coins in such a scenario when they could do just as well staking 1?
@_date: 2018-07-15 20:17:00
That's capitalism on the blockchain. Socialism on the blockchain would be that each staker gets the same reward no matter how much they stake.

They are only accused of embezzlement up until the point they are proven guilty. Should a person be punished for being suspected of something?
