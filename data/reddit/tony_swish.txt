We have some great examples and resources on [Augur.net}( but my favorite one is this:

Saw this and thought it was awesome. 
I learned a ton from Stephen from when I was at BitPay and realized that he is one of the most upfront and honest people I have met. Happy to still have a friendship with him today and even happier to see him all over the media the past few days!
@_date: 2016-01-24 06:34:25
BTW, BitPay is the best..... They get hate for bullshit but do great things like this. I can tell you first hand, no one else gets payments like they do and these deals mean more than most realize.
@_date: 2016-01-12 21:03:17
Surprised this didn't get a bigger response, a lot of the tactics are obviously happening.
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:38:48
When I read this (before listening) I had no idea what this meant. Now it makes more sense. I don't regularly listen to the show (no hate, just not in my rotation) so I had no idea what they meant by it.
@_date: 2016-11-08 15:49:03
I like The Bitcoin Podcast myself....

Thanks for the compliment!

Also, REP can be purchased with bitcoin as that will be the easiest and most likely the widest use method for purchasing.
@_date: 2015-08-11 23:06:56
I hate to respond to this but please don't just accuse us of being "loud" when we have really tried hard to have a concise message that gets people interested. Thankfully we have the most viewed YouTube video on Prediction Markets ever in history....
So while you may accuse us of being "loud" we take pride in that and we are very happy that those who have investigated both Truthcoin and Augur choose Augur.
@_date: 2015-07-16 02:41:10
The Augur Alpha is currently available and we are asking users to submit feedback so we can identify and fix as many bugs as possible.
We have tried to be as open as possible regarding the development timeline and are currently planning to have the Reputation crowdsale two weeks after the Ethereum Frontier release (although this is always subject to change).
If you have any questions or concerns regarding any specifics on the development process please feel free to contact us on the website, twitter or slack and we can clarify anything you may need to know.

My company is Augur, we are getting a lot of press, google Augur and Politico, Fox News among others have covered us in the past 2 days. We raised $3.5 million in 5 days.

Agreed. I worked with Manuel at BitPay and can attest to his great work on Copay and Bitcore. A few weeks ago I got to meet some of the other team members when we talked to them on my podcast.
The media people I've explained this to are usually quite floored that this is something that actually exists (in a good way of course). They usually have tons of questions and I have to explain how early it is in the idea's evolution, but this is something that so many different types of content creates have wanted for years.
I definitely agree with the fact there may be more applications in the future, but I'm more excited by it's potential in the near to immediate future.
@_date: 2015-07-17 03:31:13
Absolutely, and the reason different people from the team replied is because we try to be as proactive as possible as I mentioned above. We are pouring everything into this and our work is starting to pay off with increased recognition, only reason to continue what we are doing.
@_date: 2015-07-16 00:53:55
We here at Augur are ecstatic that Coinbase listed us along with 21, Abra, Streamium and Blockstream as the most exciting bitcoin projects. It's such an honor to be listed in the same breath as those projects.
I hope that we continue to use this momentum and get more and more users to the [Augur Alpha]( so we can improve the system and identify bugs!
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:06:00
Since it seems that many people seeing this aren't familiar with Augur, I wanted to share our short ["How Augur Works"]( video that explains the project in full.
We also have another short video, [Reputation 101]( that goes explains the process of reporting and why Reputation Token holders are the essential piece of Augur's decentralized oracle system.

He stole my line! Thankfully Andreas is the best and he will do much more with the line than I ever could...
@_date: 2015-07-17 03:28:16
Very solid point, I am fairly confident the team is now aware this is needed and will be working on it.
@_date: 2015-07-15 11:47:12
The fact you used BAMF in the title made me take absolutely nothing you said after that seriously. This is actually a good thing as everything you said after that looks copied and pasted from a Indeed.com job posting.
@_date: 2015-07-17 06:40:27
To be fair I did utilize some research I read quite a while ago about this, but if you think about the popularity of The Underground it does make sense. The only sport I could see with fans who are more into technology would be possibly be Hockey I believe.
@_date: 2015-07-16 00:56:32
Generally I have noticed they are rather honest and positive when it comes to bitcoin, just far more logical and thoughtful than other communities that are full of hype.
@_date: 2015-07-17 09:23:07
I can't argue taste and I'm unsure how you feel about boxing but MMA is actually a much safer sport as there is much less direct damage to the brain. Many fights end in submissions which cause someone to tap out before any damage is done in most cases.
I'm not really placing you in that demographic, I'm just stating that UFC tends to attract 18 to 34 year old males and Bitcoin tends to attract 18 to 34 males. I mean, the guy who announces the UFC fights has repeatedly had Andreas Antonopoulos on his immensely popular podcast to talk Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-01 06:05:21
Thank you very much! Sorry for the slow reply.
The only thing we ask is that if you appreciate the show, please share share share :-) Oh and feel free to follow me on Twitter [

Would love for him to book someone on to talk about the other uses for decentralized tech.

Your accusation of dishonesty bothers me to a great degree so I wanted to directly reply to this on behalf of myself, not as a member of the Augur team.
We have been transparent and communicative in everything we have done since day one. The entire team has used their True Names on all communication channels as we felt it was important to go out of our way to show that we stand behind this project.
You are clearly not wishing us success, as one tends to not make unfounded accusations of dishonesty and obfuscation regarding a project they claim to support. A passive-aggressive reply containing statements stating that Ethereum is not "pure at heart" does nothing to back up your claim that we are dishonest. 


This quote is what actually made me feel the necessity to reply to this. In my opinion (and by design), our project gets attention because of we go out of our way to answer questions and maintain an honest dialogue with anyone who is interested. Our reputation has led to a market-leader like Coinbase [naming Augur]( as one of the most exciting projects in 2015. We share this distinction with 21, Streamium, Blockstream and Abra, who are seen as legitimate and trusted throughout this industry. 
I have no problem that you support and  promote a similar project, I have a massive problem with your strategy of accusing us of being a scam with absolutely no proof. You further this by taking a subtle dig on how we have promoted what we are doing and the success we have had in doing so, which does nothing positive for anyone involved. This comes across as sour grapes and if you wanted to support and promote another project, you would be much better off focusing on that and not us.

Young, tech-savvy males.

Most people here know my involvement with both music and bitcoin, so I found this extremely interesting. I've sent these [two]( [tweets]( to him and I hope he contacts me back.
My conversation with Steve Albini who has produced Nirvana, PJ Harvey, Pixies, Cheap Trick is linked in the first tweet, it's highly recommended. The chat with [Shooter Jennings]( is interesting on this too, we have had many many discussions on things similar to this. If you dig the article OP shared, check out those podcasts as they will be up your alley.

Wanted to reply and let everyone know how happy I am that Perry joined our team, getting to know him has been a treat and I would encourage everyone to read this article.
In the past he has written for Fortune Magazine, USA Today and Financial Times, so be sure to keep an eye on our blog for other awesome blog posts from Perry.

To participate in the Augur crowdsale :-)

Also from Detroit, moved to Atlanta to work at BitPay actually. Awesome to see this and see that so many Detroiters are here.
I'm hoping to do some stuff with Oakland University in the future, they did recently highlight me in one of their alumni magazines so I'm hoping to get a Bitcoin community there soon.
@_date: 2015-07-15 11:41:17
I think there's a possibility he died sometime in May, obviously I don't know for sure though
@_date: 2015-09-11 19:27:16
This is a massively old thread I realize that, but I'm just seeing it for the first time.
I used to work at bitpay and I can say that overall they are a great company with really solid leadership.
What does bum me out is that a fellow coworker decided to answer questions under a throwaway. Eric is classy enough to post his feedback under his True Name and I think that everyone who does has my respect....so I hope that in the future others do the same as putting your name behind your comments is what really makes me take something seriously.
@_date: 2015-09-14 04:40:59
The point the OP made is something that couldn't accurately measurable by what data has been gathered. He states that he believes bitcoin's problems are philosophical and not technical which is a pretty clear indicator that this isn't something that data can give much insight to. Unfortunately these facts are exactly why the questions in the post are useless in this argument.
I agreed completely with his topic but then read the full post and really thought his arguments resulted in making his point come across terribly. Stagnant "legitimate" bitcoin use is making it very difficult for startups to grow, which appears to be very true in a lot of what I've seen. This is followed up with vague questions that make me think OP hasn't thought this issue through very well.
@_date: 2015-09-14 04:28:01
I do agree with the point here but think that both are important issues. So much VC money is being poured into bitcoin and there is still no real consumer incentive to use it for payments (something I now don't think will end up happening at all). This is to the degree that it doesn't even seem like many are trying anymore.
If you come up with a real reason that people should use bitcoin over other payment options, then it will succeed. Sorry but the political and technological motivations don't overcome convenience to become real options. 
Something will make use of this technology properly and it will be a huge success, I'm just less convince it will be bitcoin as every day passes.
@_date: 2015-11-11 23:02:18
The community is growing along with interest and projects on the platform.... IMHO it's the most exciting segment of this space by a mile.
@_date: 2015-10-03 02:32:52
I'm a former BitPay-er and I agree it's unfortunate...
I can say from first hand experience that the company's goals and actions were always for the betterment of Bitcoin in general.
Additionally, I got to work with Jeff personally and he's such a great guy who even went out of his way to help out someone in Marketing who had little to do with what he was working on. As much as I get exasperated by the online community around bitcoin, almost everyone I get a chance to work with IRL is brilliant and fantastic to work with...Jeff is no exception and I can't say enough positive things about him.
Almost every single person at BitPay were very hardworking and kicked ass at their jobs. I have my own opinions of why they are struggling but it really doesn't differ a lot from what has been said by others.... I just know that a lot of good friends and good people are no longer with bitpay and that hurts everyone involved.
I suppose the only plus would be for other startups and projects who now have access to some of the brightest who have experience with Bitcoin. It's not easy to find a compliance rep or client operations manager who had a year of success and also have knowledge of Bitcoin tech...but now I know some that are on the open market and I'm surprised that more people aren't asking me for contacts (some have, but not as many as I figured).
Obviously developers are generally in higher demand, but finding people in these other fields that actually understand bitcoin is even tougher....and I can think of two people who aren't developers that a startup should snatch in .0001 of a second. I wish I had started my own thing because the available talent right now is ridiculous.
@_date: 2015-10-16 23:34:00
I'm on the Augur team and really happy to see some conversation in here about the project! We love Bitcoin and would love for everyone here to review &amp; contribute to our code.
Thanks for the kind words too. 
@_date: 2016-05-30 22:25:49
I sincerely doubt Coinbase makes major business decisions on short-term crypto price fluctuations. 
They are IMO the most important player in this space and have done more for bitcoin than any business I can think of.... It's funny how fast this community will turn on you when a decision is made that someone truly believes is best for their business.

She most likely said "blockchain" because discussion of the specific blockchain the platform is banned on communication platforms such as this one.
