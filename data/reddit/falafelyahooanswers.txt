Whilst I agree that the founders migrating to symbiont, focusing on commercial activities and partnering with vanguard etc, leaving their open source creation to the wild had a big impact- at one point 1% of all tx were counterparty and counterparty was funding 1% of all nodes, but then there was a big argument about spam which the likes of omni got caught up im when core dev luke blocked all omni and counterparty tx 
development since has been slow compared to the likes of ethereum which has been a total juggernaut, but as bitcoin price has risen, actually the tx fee has come down, it is down to 0.20 or so, less if you can wait. 
(and there are lightning like hub/spoke payment channels already existing) not to mention the improvements in batching bringing fees down due to be implemented. Remember sidechains too have expense. 
  For many transactions XCP is not needed (for instance you can issue a token now, for only cents on counterparty using only bitcoin.  XCP is only needed as an anti spam measure for registering vanity asset/atomically swapping. BTC can be wrapped to XBTC in the same way the decentralised eth exchanges wrap to weth for ERC compatibility
Ultimately I support RSK, XCP and any second layer protocol that brings fantastic new use cases to bitcoin, in counterpartys case for instance one big revolution was the decentralised exchange. Ok so it's clunky but it works and has existed for 4 years now, before EtH was ever launched. No mean feat. It allows you to sidestep the centralized risk of holding funds on exchange and trade directly p2p. 
Maybe I'm just a fanboy about this sort of tech but IMO It's what bitcoin was all about, empowering the user, removing middlemen, putting the control in the users hands.

*Summary*: "Smart contracts---stateful executable objects hosted on blockchains like Ethereum---carry billions of dollars worth of coins and cannot be updated once deployed. We present a new systematic characterization of a class of trace vulnerabilities, which result from analyzing multiple invocations of a contract over its lifetime. 
We focus attention on three example properties of such trace vulnerabilities: finding contracts that either lock funds indefinitely, leak them carelessly to arbitrary users, or can be killed by anyone. We implemented MAIAN, the first tool for precisely specifying and reasoning about trace properties, which employs inter-procedural symbolic analysis and concrete validator for exhibiting real exploits. Our analysis of nearly one million contracts flags 34,200 (2,365 distinct) contracts vulnerable, in 10 seconds per contract.
 On a subset of3,759 contracts which we sampled for concrete validation and manual analysis, we reproduce real exploits at a true positive rate of 89%, yielding exploits for3,686 contracts. Our tool finds exploits for the infamous Parity bug that indirectly locked 200 million dollars worth in Ether, which previous analyses failed to capture."

" you don't own stock. What you own is an entitlement to stock held for you by your broker. But your broker doesn't own the stock either. What your broker owns is an entitlement to stock held for it by Cede &amp; Co., which is a nominee of the Depository Trust Company."
Take a read of that to see some of the shocking implications of the lack of individual ownership of public stock and how DTCC can leverage this to their advantage in regards to things like voting.
 "Cede technically owns substantially all of the publicly issued stock in the United States.[3] Thus, investors do not themselves hold direct property rights in stock, but rather have contractual rights that are part of a chain of contractual rights involving Cede"

Silvers never weathered a crash well, focus migrated towards gold and I beleive the same will happen in the event of a global crash with consolodation towards btc short medium and long term.
I'd recommend a read of this paper, particularly the musings on the store of value segment
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:46:06
Beyond a point in time where there is such an ecosystem built on top of bitcoin (ie THE dominant battle tested blockchain) that permits it's IMO inevitable recognition as a viable store of value (enough on/off ramps, sufficient regulation to bring in institutional money -- all things which are slowly but steadily happening in the past years since it's birth) there are still numerous fascinating and disruptive use cases for the blockchain
For example timestamping/notarising. I could hash the contents of anything such as an invention or important news and prove beyond any reasonable doubt that indeed such a thing was invented or known at a certain time and have independent parties across the universe come to agree on that nature and have no reasonable ability to censor the contents.
Then you can have on another basic level simple trustless bets between users for applications that don't require an outside oracle.
Or the ability to write a will, gift, or transaction automatically locking funds to a point in time they are allowed to be spent for example you can create a wallet and have it be able to be spent- say in 18 years for a newborn. This kind of digital programmable gold is absolutely fascinating, and. I beleive the current and next generation will envisage and realise use cases we never even touched upon. 
These are just the basic examples.

Anyone who has been around for any significant time I can assure you, would not be calling bitcoins premature "death" just because the price has only risen 25% in a week in response to a selloff of 50% earlier and doesn't continue a permanent trajectory upwards on every piece of positive news any more than it gets pushed down by every piece of negative news
We had a correction in equal response to a rapid rise, maybe there's more going down. maybe some up, some down
- who knows.  Anyone with a long term perspective shouldn't really be the least bit concerned by fluctuations unless they're a daytrading type
 as all they need to ask themselves is: *is bitcoin long term going to be in a better position at some chosen point in the future (let's say this month next year or this month in two years) than it is now?* 
 if the answer is yes then it does not matter if there is sideways action for weeks, days, or even many many months. 
If the answer is no, then perhaps the question is why would you have ever been investing?
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:41:34
Guilty. I'm just genuinely curious at the phenomenon considering the amount of effort. that goes into sourcing appropriate memes and producing TA charts that relevant news takes such time to hit front page to a ~750k audience.
 I'm long term bullish and don't trade but realise the opportunity for those to try and capitalise on a spin exists (both ways but in this case probably more chance of a short) with such information deficit on this 'retail' venue. So why's this behaviour not seemingly apparent?

Oh and of course derivatives. "Funds invested in derivatives alone total at minimum $544 trillion, and the high-end estimate is $1.2 quadrillion"
To understand just *how small* bitcoin currently is in the grand scheme of various other financial constructs and how it stacks up looking like david in comparison to the goliath of even small groups (&lt;50) of the top individually wealthy individuals worlwide I'd recommend a long stare at the infographic linked below to put things in perspective. It's really quite hard to get a scale of the sheer enormity when dealing with such large numbers alone.

When I say gold outperformed, I'm referring relative to holding a position in the S&amp;P 500 or holding cash 
specifically during crashes and the periods of economic downturn that follow. And 5/6 there not 4/6 due to hyperinflation
Chart below
Like the priced in gold site though, bookmarked it! and agree we're skating of thin ice and very close to a crash, a lot of current and future indicators not looking good whatsoever.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:40:52
It's true, but all things considered data shows gold has outperformed holding stocks (and cash) in the last 5/6 major crashes stretching back from 1978. In fact it only performed worse in the period of 1980-1982. 
I don't think it's wholly unreasonable, for a flurry of reasons to not expect a digital gold to step up as a tangible digital replacement for large swathes of dispirate participants seeking a negatively correlated, easily convertible, fixed supply asset 
BTC was borne out one of the biggest crashes we've ever known. Smooth sailing so far but the worlwide markets aren't looking pretty at all. 
Time will tell if people explore btc as an avenue of weathering the storm when the next crash hits. I think it's very plausible, even a temporary dip in those looking for the exits will quickly be countered with new entrants.

Future generations will have a  programmable, digital gold at their fingertips, and will accept it as the default.  it has already metamorphised drastically in such a short time and is clearly here to stay  The fundamentals are strong and innovation is consistent. The cat cannot go back into the bag. Empowering technologies may change, may be stifled but they will never be eradicated.
If you're reading this- a current participant and understand and are excited by the implications of the technology and not just in it for the price, realise you're making a contribution in some way and have the potential to change something if you wish. The beauty of this permissionless system is me, you, yes even your neighbor can have a part to play in the unfolding and playing of the world's first decentralised instrument
If you've got kids, maybe they're learning about bitcoin already. Maybe you taught them some things already and they'll grow up with a healthy self taught excitement and a knowledge of money, of markets, of math and computing. maybe they have a wallet. 
maybe one day your kids might be asking to hear your stories of back in the day, and they'll be dusting off an old hardware wallet to take into antiques roadshow. Years after you pass they can look back on the graffiti you paid a few satoshis to leave on the blockchain, "dad wrote that" they say. "back in 2018. People said it was a crash" 
They can leave theit own message too. And millions of storage devices across the globe will replicate it, their kids can look back and smile. Never forgotten

Vodafone is behind M-Pesa- A massively successful mobile based p2p wallet and payment system utilised heavily (almost exclusively in some cases) in developing countries.
 Recent documentation hints at various mergers and acquisitions (like with the biggest telco in India). Seems as if there is exploration towards adding the ability to buy/sell/hold currencies like btc in mobile wallets in collaboration with other big players, and the end goal is enhancing the reach of m-pesa and bringing this feature to the markets where m-pesa does not already have a foothold.  
Read the document "Bitcoin and Mobile Payments: Constructing a European Union Framework" to get a bit more of a clue. Huge news if such a thing gains traction, by the way.

All in all, as someone who's watched a few of these over the years I was pleased with the dialogue. Giancarlo especially seems cognizant, well researched and moderate. I wnjoyed the anecdote about his family members - it reminded me of the moment I discovered the tech and spent many days pondering the world changing implications- Generally the sentiment seems to be slowly transitioning from the initial 'push it away' heard from hearings years ago over from 'wait and see' to 'ok- it's not going away, there seems to be real excitement brewing for real reason- let's wrap our heads around this not being too hasty and reign in in so nobody is getting ripped off or doing anything too wild'. 
Markets worlwide received a long overdue correction after quantative exuberance went mad, I beleive we needed a reality check. We need steady, measured growth looking forward with fundamentals sound. There's continual protocol improvements &amp; solid innovations with some major ones upcoming promising higher throughput &amp; sane fees- players such as robinhood entering the market shortly 
we've got huge excess US deficit potentially coming up and a bunch of other unknowns. All I know is there's an increasing number of individuals are passionate about the disruptive potential of this brand new asset class, people old and young who have never seen anything like it and are fascinated. Some of them may have been scared off, some will have been waiting on the sidelines. Collectively there's been a bit of a humbling. This is a chance to learn and grow. Like it or not, regulation brings clarity and assurance to a wave of market participants (particularly institutional investors, who at least tend to have a longer term purview and access to capital). I'm positive about the future and will be following developments and contributiing what I can for the foreeseable future, many many years i can imagine. Excited to be a part of this revolution

Seems you are talking about merchant protection rather than 'outright fraud'. For merchants (and anyone who has sold goods or services online can probably attest to this) btc is certainly a win, not so much for a customer perhaps. 
whilst you can't call up bitcoin customer services hotline to get a refund on that 0.003BTC you just sent directly to a company selling discount 4K tv's that turned out to be a sham, you won't find that days or months later you're having to call up to dispute charges either or having your whole balance drained because of the innate push vs pull nature of the transaction.
In reality you wouldn't realistically expose yourself to much 'fraud' buying on newegg from bitpay for example, and I'm sure an extra fee could be baked in on a centralized gateway/intermediary to absorb risk,  But I accept that that won't be the story the whole time with smaller/unknown retailers, and frankly there's a certain class of customer who has gotten used to the protections of cc's so I wouldn't in good faith be trying to convince them to give that up and switch to purchasing couches and electronics using btc instead,  despite the fact they still have levels of consumer protection outside of using a card to fall back on. 
But I'm digressing, let's talk about individual parties. there are various options. I'd encourage a proper look, not just a skim! at the two decentralised platforms below (an exchange and an ebay-like-platform) 
both have had to take the time to integrate novel dispute resolution techniques (generally network of escrow/arbitration and the onto verifiable proofs if dispute continues). Theyre largely operated on a kind of web of trust so it doesn't have to get to that point- with extra incentives tacked along not to abuse beyond the natural incentives you would find anyway from someone wanting to preserve a business by continuing to operate in good faith.

After a rocky few days both the global markets AND crypto markets are recovering "The current market sell off is just a correction, said Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin" (He just testified to house financial serviced comittee saying 'markets are fine' and that 'fundamentals are strong')
He told the House Financial Services Committee that markets were functioning very well, although the administration was monitoring the situation.
The talk over at the crypto hearing is neutral- positive. Giancarlo especially seems cognizant, well researched and moderate. Generally the sentiment seems to be slowly transitioning from the initial 'push it away' heard from hearings years ago over from 'wait and see' to 'ok- it's not going away, let's wrap our heads around this and reign in in so nobody is getting ripped off or doing anything too wild'. Markets worlwide are getting a long overdue correction after quantative exuberance went mad- we've got huge excess US deficit potentially coming up. BTC is not going anywhere.
I wouldn't be suprised to see a flight to this new asset class in 2018 should the debt exceed 1trln, (hint: it will) despite the herd mentality and recent domino sell offs.  it is nothing but a blip in the ocean for this disruptive, paradigm shifting tech in the coming years. Bitcoin is the birth of a black swan event and we ain't seen nothing yet. 
Like it or not regulatory framework will bring clarity, reduce risk and encourage institutional players who tend to be, at the least more measured and with a longer term purbiew. dust is settling from this global correction. Fundamentals are strong, good things on the horizon- a constant evolution. People are thinking in short term. Nervousness has lost some market participants who got in for the wrong reasons- some cut losses and left ahead, some will stick by the sidelines others just did no research and have been shook out rightfully (for now). I'm positive long term absolutely, and more so now than in a while.

Things seem a bit calmer now, I'm fairly neutral- slightly bullish even. Markets everywhere are frothy right now, with some tension in the air for a big crash on the equities markets at some indeterminate point in the future. Frankly I can't pretend to comment on short term fluctuations with any air of authority but I think heading towards  the end of Feb - early march is very promising. Why?
* The fundamentals are strong. Regulatory environment is promising
* Dust will settle from worldwide 
correction, 
* Fed is likely going to raise interest rates
* Robinhood launches
* lightning and segwit adoption will continue to increase (particularly amongst the key players) improving throughput &amp; tx speed/cost and new utilities will be based on this tech that were previously cumbersome/unattractive. And then there's a laundry list of proposed BIP's im the pipeline
* Perhaps most of all a large bit of the bad sentiment and doom and gloom hanging around will have been shook out. That simple. People wait for signals, for moments. It's a herd mentality
I don't like making price predictions, and I think the market would really benefit from a period of sideways or steady, measured growth. End of Feb, march is what I am eyeing up for that to begin.
I'm bullish in the medium term, and absolutely long term (although I think the last one goes without saying)
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:59:11
No problem. It's a bit of a radically different system, far from perfect but no doubt lot's of exciting experiments.  There are many, many different kinds of approach to enabling honest behavior and eradicating the traditional  role of centralized services in acting as a middleman and gatekeeper preventing bad actors that I didn't touch upon. 
Yes, they may well be technical and clunky in their current nascent incarnation but a lot of the real groundwork has already been done and i think ultimately for quite a large subset of use cases end users gain a huge net benefit from such an approach-  from (cross) chain atomic swaps enabling token to token exchanges trustlessly without the risk of storing balance on an exchange to various smart contract schemes allowing collaterised fiat without having to trust the solvency of an issuer to provably fair bets without crazy house edges- it's not just about offloading the risk for a management surcharge it's about eradicating it entirely in some cases!
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:53:40
True, but realistically can you expect asset managers with established histories on the line, and tens of billions singularly under management to **definitively** announce embracement of a "brand new"  type of asset class-- cryptocurrency-- to a portfolio currently comprised of entirely traditional, well understood finacial instruments in what is still such a nascent phase?
Honestly, I'm fairly surprised the consideration is so high already. As regulatory framework becomes structured up I beleive we'll see a trickle when one player dips their toes in the water and then a torrent. Smaller firms and private wealth managers are already fielding requests. 
Bigger players naturally may have a lower risk tolerance. But each and every one is interested in diversification and monitoring trends, future directions.
They're watching and waiting

Gold has historically done very well, better than holding cash 5/6 times and better than staying in stock markets 5/6 times during crashes (and subsequent recessions) 
Gold even climbed in the biggest crash of them all, the 56% decline that lasted two full years in 2008, it posted up 25%. The dotcom bust? gold up 12.5% s&amp;p down 49% 
I fully anticipate Bitcoin to perform analogously, when, not if a collapse hapens and provide a safe haven.

An atomic swap is an exchange of two assets/tokens atomically 
E.G counterparty or omni (metalayers on top of the bitcoin blockchain) assets can be exchanged directly, trustlessly with no centralised intermediary at a protocol level.
A cross chain atomic swap, as the name implies is the same but across two seperate blockchains. for example BTC for LTC
@_date: 2018-02-26 08:22:15
At one point, I'd certainly agree; fees were as high as $30+, making any significant use of counterparty extremely expensive..and RSK favorable-  However fees have come down significantly and are now between 11 and 40 cents. IMO a small price to pay for issuing an immutable token backed by the security of bitcoin
The counterparty protocol was vetted by Sergio Lerner and Peter Todd- unlike ethereum where hundreds of millions had been at one point stolen to this date no funds have been lost over the past 4 years due to a protocol/contract vulnerability
 Fees will only come down with the following soon to be implemented CIP's (BIP equivalents)
CIP 6 – P2SH data encoding
CIP 10 – Multi-Peer Multi-Asset Sends (MPMA) 
CIP 15 – Segwit Support
CIP 13 – Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT)
In addition, at least one developer has already demonstrated an application of counterparty (bitcoin) assets on Lightning, as well as a pure atomic swap and as that becomes tested and reaches maturity it may offer tangible benefits
As segwit adoption, along with batching increase across the whole ecosystem and these CIPs are merged I expect counterparty to increasingly be useful and in conjuction with sidechains like RSK to provide a valuable token based economy on top of bitcoin, despite the fact ethereums been hogging the limelight for the past several years

Economic growth will slump with a continued lull in worldwide equity markets and careless interest rate rises. Either way you've got the federal spending hikes, unfunded tax cuts (+rising net interest)- either someone steps in to stop flight to bonds and loosen policy to stave off the chaos in markets and save face of the pres and  in turn btc gets a break or we're headed down to us debt as a share of GDP meltdown and I'd full expect some to see crypto as a safe haven given the current price as it's still nascent with unique propertied.

Not yet, however Tokens have been running on counterparty.io metalayer, on the bitcoin blockchain for 4 years. (It's surpassed it's millionth transaction) and could be ported to a side chain
However in reality it doesn't see much use, bitcoiners in general don't seem to see the use of tokenization, and all the attention there has gone to eth where many people create ERC tokens instead- even if they don't need a smart contract. Not sure RSK will be any different

Please be careful making statements!, they do (of course) on their end deal with the equivalent underlying asset, in Revoluts case via exchange partner bitstamp and their banking partners and are also regulated and covered by financial protection schemes and this is easily fact checkable. 
In addition- Both Robinhood and Revolut aim to allow external transfers in the future, and have both made statements to that effect
 however for the time being for compliance they've chosen to abstract that for a faster launch and ease of exposure to allow new users to sign up and purchase without going through the hassles of signing up an exchange, dealing with wallets etc. Yes it's more expensive but massively more convenient for non sophisticated users or those who want an easy all in one solution.

"We’re looking to release Phase 1 within the next few weeks, and hope to support external transfers in the near future — we’re working closely with our biggest financial partners to make this a reality. "

Ridiculousness of the "hodl" meme aside, You'll save yourself a lot of stress if you just walk away and don't refresh the price. I you're hell bent on selling once you're in the positive, put a sell order up and leave and it either get's filled or it doesn't. My money would be on it getting filled at some indeterminate point in the future and then you're like. "what now?". Sure you can leave and cash out permanently but by that time, for all you know it'd blas past and the landscape will be different, you maybe will have learned more and still don't need the funds and want to get back in.

I'm largely inclined to agree having been building up a set of data points plotting the 'birds eye view' from more of an institutional long term perspective. 
Surveyed hedge fund managers and Private equity firms are also signalling a general feeling of lower regulatory concerns (at least in the US) which bodes well for capitalising on this emerging space 
A quarter of all surveyed PE and hedge fund managers indicating an interest for exposure to bitcoin in &lt;2 years, and three quarters of firms signalling 3-4 years is a most interesting climate to be under. No doubt should such a reality continue to materialise any thoughts of sudden reactionary enforcement or changes in framework will be increasingly measured, and tempered rather than sudden and reactionary.

Not addressing the likelihood per se but Is it possible? certainly.
 There are ~2x as many documented millionares owning at *least* 1mill in the world than the entire circulating supply of bitcoin. (34 million millionares at last count and growing rapidly) 
Assuming *all* current BTC were for sale, If each millionare wanted to purchase a whole bitcoin for a million $ they could barely buy 0.5. Certainly there are more undocumented millionares existing and certainly there are single individuals with considerably higher amounts at their disposal (we are talking single players with enough capital, at least on paper to purchase 1/2 of the total supply by themselves)
And then we haven't even **scraped the surface** of any other possible entrants (like the 99% of everyone else) hedge funds, ETFs, private equity, governmental holding reserves nor factored in the (at estimates large amount) of lost coins or crucially the fact a small available supply results in driving demand+price up in the event of a huge inflow
