The author of the article speculating that Bitcoin may be next is a big difference from the IRS and Obama admin eying Bitcoin next as the title of this post states.

To think only yesterday it was floating around 128/129.

There isn't a benefit to writing a script that sells off all of Satoshi's coins at a set time.  You seem to think "human behavior when confronted with money" is to do the worst thing possible for no reason.  Satoshi doesn't need to be angelic or altruistic to not sell off, just rational.

There would have been a message before you ordered, something like they have exceeded their sell amount, would you like to buy at market price.  When that message isn't there it locks in at current price.

Same thing that went on yesterday.

I think it's unlikely that Coinbase could raise a $5 million investment led by Union Square Ventures if it was likely that accounts will eventually be seized.

I'm assuming that if someone smart enough to create a cryptocurrency needed money, they would know that trying to sell 1.5-2 million coins at once is the worst way to get it.

Seems like a dick move to bring up a student's paper unsolicited, then disparage it twice.

Why do you doubt that?  He's been affiliated with MMA and the UFC since before it was well regulated and legal in 49 states, and he doesn't seem concerned that much of his drug consumption is illegal.  If he's not supporting it I think it's more likely he's just not that into it, than it is he's worried about regulation.

I think there's a &gt;99% chance we see $120 again.

OP, I feel like that sums it up best.

Where are you getting the "eyes Bitcoin next" from?

That is a link to scenes of fictional characters in a movie.  Not only did none of them created a cryptocurrency then try to sell ~14% of it all at once, but they are also... you know... Not real.

This is not true.  When gas prices get high, almost every gas station offers a lower rate if you pay by cash.

Does the current price movement look anything like that diagram?

    Sponsorship 1: $500 - A company logo patch is worn on my shirt.
    Sponsorship 2: $1000 - Your company logo is embroidered on both sleeves(shoulder area).
    Full Sponsorship: $2500 - Your company logo is embroidered on my chest area, as well as sleeves - or I will wear a company shirt already in production from your company. A logo is also embroidered onto a hat, which will be worn the entire tournament.
LOL.  In a field of ~2000 people why on earth would a company pay $2,500 for a random guy to wear a shirt and a hat with their logo?  If they wanted to advertise that way they could find someone to do it for $25.

I don't think the spectrum is that wide.  Most are Libertarians with some Anarchists mixed in.

When I want to buy, I just keep checking throughout the day until the message is gone.  It's always been, for me, within 8 hours.
