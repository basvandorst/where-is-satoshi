Value is in the eye of the beholder.   Your perception of value is different than mine.

Math is as natural as nature itself
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:53:32
Yes... I certainly have been asked to express my desires.  It seems that other people did not always agree with me.   Nothing more fun than being told to stuff it by 51% of my fellow citizens.

I am sort of convinced this is all the result of US tax season.  Selling to cover tax liabilities from last years growth/sales.

Value is what you are willing to part with to acquire OR what you are willing to accept in compensation.  Nothing more and nothing less.   
Intrinsic means naturally belongs.   In gold most comment on its physical qualities as intrinsic.   For Bitcoin it would be more about the digital/logical qualities such as the system and the network.

What is your inflation rate?   
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:02:50
Not everyone values gold.    Just many.

I buy them to use, save, and give to charity.   
I am a long term believer in the tech. Just waiting for everyone else to come to terms with what this all means :).
This is going to be a wild ride!

 "The real reason" is essentially impossible.   The OP cries out for guesses.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:42:06
In fact, I recall reading disclaimers about slight variations in performance in most mining hardware docs.
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:29:34
I declare quibbling!   But sure.   Bitcoins created by "doing" math :-)

@_date: 2014-02-27 23:46:19
This is...

@_date: 2014-02-28 07:07:26
Bitcoins have a declarative end to them.   Gold does not.  
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:03:38
Gold is not accepted  universally.   Go use it at your favorite fast food joint.

The Triganic Pu is more my style
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:03:57
Bitcoin are scarce
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:04:25
Bitcoin are created by math
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:06:29
Bitcoins are finite (although you can grow after the decimal point)
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:44:00
Please keep in mind that the generation of addresses needs to be random as well!   Just unplugging means people can't immediately steal.  It does nothing if your random number generation is the equivalent of 1.2.3.4.

Long paragraph but good description. HTH
@_date: 2013-12-14 12:52:10
Wolfram alpha does this now!  Hopefully not too much longer for Google.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:53:34
Don't see it.   Pic or it didn't happen.
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:14:26
Long paragraph so I lost track.   That said the author seems to have nailed it.  
Op read this for a good summary
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:24:56
Another great release.  Thank you Dev team!
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:25:33
And think of the starch in those stuffed shirts when you are Ironing!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:38:16


Not sure I follow.    You can still have debt in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-28 13:25:58
Can't tell if you are joking so will just answer as if you are not.
Regulation in the US has the force of law.  You may be regulated by both federal and state.  At times they even conflict!
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:15:14
Pay wall :(

Ummm key logging?

@_date: 2013-11-29 06:03:39
No bleeping way....
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:00:33
We have much evidence that people spend more when Bitcoin price goes up.
This is an old and tired angle that some keep trying to perpetrate "oh no, deflation!".  [Runs around waving arms in air].
@_date: 2013-12-14 12:58:23
This sounds very close to pruning.  An idea under active discussion/development.   You may want to check that out.

Nice article
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:57:57
Article is old?
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:21:28
Its Friday here...   I already gave today.  This is a great idea!
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:37:37
Just saw that...  Angst note retracted.   This is awesome!   My wife is ecstatic.
EDIT:   up votes for everyone :-)

Oh man... If this becomes cool I want nothing to do with it.

Consider this future.
Customer spend address monitor.   Connect with the major nodes and watch for more than one transaction from the spending address.  Race condition would require very close timewise proximity.   
So do the following
Check sending address for quantity of coin.
Check for any spend from that address after your initial spend with retailer (a few seconds is enough).
If address would have insufficient fund from multiple transactions ask the customer to step aside and wait for security to "help."
