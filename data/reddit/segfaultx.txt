No it's too volatile another new cryptocurrency that is designed to be more stable is more likely to. Also with mining becoming unprofitable and will likely become even more unprofitable when the next halve comes bitcoin becomes more vulnerable to 51% attack as miners cash out and stop mining.

Only early adopters would. Anyone who bought on the rise last year would of lost massively instead.

From my understanding they are useless because they charge too high rate so your better off using an exchange especially if you do a high amount of money.

If no fiat then it'd have to be gold/silver/copper, which is still pretty much money. Also a world without fiat isn't possible since not everyone in the world has PC/smartphones/internet. Even now a good chunk of the world population doesn't have it.

If bitcoin fad fades out then it will be replaced by another cryptocoin. That would prevent the price rise and instead could cause a crash in bitcoin because depending on how big the other cryptocoin is it can pretty much take the whole cryptomarket.

There is only a limited amount of bitcoins to mine what happens when it runs out? Miners won't have an incentive to mine anymore.

A severe vulnerability is discovered in bitcoin by a hacker and is not disclosed. So he is able to exploit it and steal all the bitcoins thus crashing it to oblivion. The vulnerability is also not figured out so isn't patched up ever even if it were discovered it would take a while to patch I'd imagine.

51% attack is when 1 miner has 51% of the network. If that happens he can control the network and even cause double spending.
