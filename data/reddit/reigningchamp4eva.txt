Are you thinking of square? They’re the easiest and most intuitive probably, and have the biggest advertising budget. They’re 2.75%, but you can get competitors around 2.3% without any effort. Remember the customer gets between 1 and 2.5% cashback, so the net fee to VISA is about 1.75% at most, or -0.3% at best.

My point is you could be born with a familial predisposition to kidney disease and heart attacks and someone else could just be normal and go to McDonald’s every day and you’re going to die first every time. 
Diet plays very minimal role beyond not being super obese and exercise is the only thing you can do that actually impacts lifespan to any real degree. 
But above all else it’s genetics. Parents die at 46? Sorry bud, do your best but you’ve got a shy life expectancy. Parents alive and well at 95? Congratulations it’s going to be hard to fuck it up.
There’s a reason most people 100+ Make it that far, it’s genetics. That’s why you have people that old being like “smoke a cig a day and get drunk as fuck on the regular”. 
So genetics is the ultimate decider, healthy habits are effectively a small modifier.

Duh, because it’s an investment which seeks returns. They’ll mine whatever is most profitable. If the price of crypto tanks they will still mine because the price of their miner will have decrease a ton too. 
The net result is a lot of miners will stop, and the rest in low cost of electricity areas (China) will buy up their hardware for dirt cheap and continue mining at 1 cent per kw with the most efficient hardware.
Inefficient hardware will be useless and thrown away.

Okay say someone that would have bought 1x 1070 for 350 at this point buys two for 500 each after taking a loan out because they don’t have 1000 lying around. Next crypto crashes further from where it already has, down to 1/4 current prices. Well now mining isn’t very profitable at all, so he wants to sell his graphics cards and pay back his loan....except so do all the other miners!
Now 1070s are running 250 each! So now he’s out 500.

If you print a bunch of counterfeit dollars and buy a ton of gold the price of gold would skyrocket (say 17x), but then when it comes out that no one was buying for that price people would go back to the price of gold before the fraudulent pump. The gold (bitcoin) would still have the same value pre pump (1000), but the people holding fake dollars (USDT) would be burned. 
That’s the idea at least.

No. They bought at 400. They don’t need a time machine. And they absolutely don’t have projections saying it’s at 20k shortly, or else they’d be buying. 
They probably thought “this cyclical pump and dump has decent potential and it’s been trading sideways for a while so not a huge risk” and bought in for relatively cheap. 
The pump happened. I’m sure they took some profits on the way up and they’ll be taking even more profits on the way down.

Haha well based on the hash rate and photos around the web I’m sure there are literally thousands of GPUs being bought by 1 person. 
Nvidia could also get back at miners by updating its graphics driver to install something that automatically mines crypto and pays out via PayPal in 10 dollar increments.

Volume and market cap are largely irrelevant to determining actual capital inflow. I can buy and sell a bitcoin 1,000,000 times, so the volume would be ~10 billion. Doesn't mean 10 billion went into bitcoin. In fact, estimates are about 6 billion has actually flowed into bitcoin. **Tether could thus represent approximately 1/3 of total $ flowing into bitcoin.**
Manipulating (and pumping) the market price is easy, and if you are accepting bitcoins for your fake dollars, you want to pump up that bitcoin as much as you can so you can sell it for more after all.

Except those estimates aren’t conservative, they’re insanely bullish. 
This is an unsourced (likely made up) estimate for 30k. You know what’s a conservative estimate? It crashing dramatically, which is what warren buffet, arguably one of, if not the greatest, investor in our lifetime. 
Just saying “conservative estimates say 30k you’ll be fine” is absurdly misleading and outright false.
No one has any idea where bitcoin is going. No one. Anyone that tells you otherwise is full of shit. It has no assets. It has no customers. It has no revenue. It has no earnings. Its value is, at this point, exclusively based on sentiment. Both for the future applications of the coin, and of course the strong desire to get rich.

USD/USDT should virtually always be at 1:1 trading pairs. It is in the best interest of tether to purchase shares when they are below 1, and sell when it's above 1. It's literally free money for them. 
Those small deviations can result in serious pay for tether, and if the fees are killing them then set up their own service where they will buy any amount of tether or sell any amount of tether for 99 cents and 101 cents respectively. Falling outside that is insane. 
Just saying that in general when there is an edge like that the discrepancy is often down to 1/1000th for non-crypto assets.

About the same as if I asked you how your sales would be impacted having all of your statues bought up at the end of a quarter instead of having a couple around. A 10%, transient increase? With no year over year change. Nvidia is an AI play, which I’ve profited from immensely. They were selling their cards as fast as they could make them before.
Imagine you make those 5 statue making factories and all of a sudden, like has happened several times over the past 5 years, no one wants to buy your statues anymore because the market for them fell out. Oh, and everyone is trying to get rid of the statues they bought at half price. Now you’re seriously in debt and your market is saturated with used statues. 
I’ll just say this, you have no idea how this works. For starters Nvidia can’t increase production because they don’t actually make the chips, they contract out production with TSMC. There are other factories but they either are often on a different process. You can’t just shove a chip design on a new process and boom more chips. The only way moving forward is for TSMC to expand production with a new factory which takes YEARS. As in longer than ethereum has even existed lol.
This was entertaining but I’m disabling notifications since this isn’t going anywhere.

I just gave an ex. of how volume doesn't mean anything. If My friend sells that 1 dollar coin back to me, and then I sell it back to him, 1 trillion times, the volume would be 1 trillion too! Still only 1 dollar going in and out of the crypto though.

Erm no, companies are reluctant to expand ddr4 production because of what happened in 2016. Memory prices often crash as too much supply comes online.

The odds of being murdered in any 1st world country is vanishingly small, so 4x a very small chance is still a small chance. 
You are correct that murder rates in ghettos are fairly high. They are effectively 0 outside of ghettos though, as that is how averages work. 
The incomes we were talking about are the median so the rich don’t impact the value at all. 
If you lined up all Americans and all Swedes from richest to poorest and found the middle person, they would be significantly richer in America. 
As a result at minimum the simple majority of Americans are richer. It likely crosses over around 30%. So top 70% of Americans are better off, bottom 30% are worse off. Aka a majority have more money.

They aren’t selling more GPUs. They are selling about as many GPUs as before (all of them) just at a faster rate. **They were selling out before the crypto craze, but they would come back in stock frequently and the price was MSRP. Now they sell out immediately and the price is 60% higher from Newegg jacking up the price.** Nvidia isn’t charging oems more money, and they aren’t selling any more GPUs than they would otherwise.
Imagine if you make 1 statue a week for 1 dollar and sell 52 statues a year. At any given point you have 2-3 statues but you sell as many as you make. Then all of a sudden everyone starts buying your statues immediately and reselling them in their own stalls next to yours. You don’t sell more statues because you only make 1 statue a week. You don’t make more money because you still sell them for 1 dollar. The only thing that changes is your inventor (2-3 statues) goes to 0, and now no one can buy your statues for a dollar but scalpers.

In which case 10 people can order the cards. I’m not saying there is a perfect solution but only allowing 2 GPU orders a year isn’t a bad idea.

I’m more optimistic about bitcoin because of the developers behind it and network effect, but I think it’s almost important to not say “well use whatever crypto instead” and cede the main use-case for bitcoin to another crypto.

No, growing a real estate business up to 200 million, then perfectly timing the market by buying in at the absolute low of the sp500 would give a bit more money. If he invested his inherited money when he actually inherited it in the sp500 he’d have made far less. 
It’s also worth nothing trump had considerable expenses I imagine over the past 2 decades. Under this stock scenario (which actually underperformed his investments) he would have had to spend 0 dollars of said money as it grew.
A lot of people crap on trump for being a bad investor or “not being as rich as he says” when the reality is he made a ton of money, as did many real estate developers. 
What they should crap on trump for is his numerous crude and embarrassing statements, the unscrupulous nature of his business ventures which not infrequently were kind of shittier than usual to people investing in his project, and of course his “trump academia” graduates that are shit out of luck after being basically scammed. 
Someone can make a lot of money and still be a bad person, I’m surprised I have to tell reddit this...

Point is the true payment fee is close to 0.5% to VISA etc. If VISA charges the business 10%, but gives 9.5% to the consumer, you won't win much business with something that costs 5% and gives 0% to the consumer. Despite being "half the fee", 10x as much goes to the 3rd party mediating the transaction. That was my point. Cheers

Inflating at a rate below 2% a year. Aka for USD to lose 2/3 of its buying power it would take 55 years. Your money shouldn’t be tied up in USD anyway. The vast majority of people’s wealth is tied up in stocks and their house. Personally I have about 1% of y wealth in USD. So **over the next 55 years I will lose .66% of my net worth**, assuming things remain the same. 
I didn’t say it couldn’t be worth 10 million dollars, in fact if bitcoin becomes the universal currency it’d be worth more than that. **I said bitcoin cannot be worth more than 300x it is now, meaning the buying power will not be more than 300x what it is now**. 
If I make my own cryptocurrency and offer to pay 1 USD for 1 million coins it has also increased infinitely. Doesn’t mean the upside of the currency is infinite from there.
How to spot you’re in a bubble: you think 300x returns (as an upper limit) are not high enough.

No, because if you want to game in 4k you might already want to have a 1080 ti. Then you make 80-100+ a month in pure profit effectively. Your "mining costs" are just electricity.

With bitcoin runs on the bank are impossible because they cannot loan out more money than they have. This might seem like a good thing but it really means loans will be a lot more costly to businesses and people will start having to pay substantial fees for security/fraud protection. But again, the run on banks is possible because most money isn’t physical and banks often are leveraged to some extent.

Facebook is worth money because it has physical assets and a 2 billion person-strong network that it has been able to monetize for a shit load of money.

I thought the implication was the satoshi envisioned btc growing slowly and organically (as it did initially).

Maybe, maybe not. Why did it take years for the price to recover the last crash if it were such a bargain? The answer is slowly it started to rise and set off another cycle....but a lot of people that got burned the first time don’t buy in the second. It requires expanding to a greater and greater amount of people until it cannot do so again and thus never recovers. 
Why aren’t you buying ethereum over bitcoin? It has had crashes before and recovered, and the gains over the past year are greater. Or why not litecoin? The transactions are faster. Or why not IoTA? The gains have been the most out of any crypto this year iirc.
The answer is these are all technically worth nothing, and we know market sentiment can turn in an instant as it did in 2013 and wipe out our gains. Sometimes for years. Sometimes forever.

What do you mean? It was an academic exercise. right now there are a whole variety of crypto currencies with objectively superior technology than bitcoin. Why aren’t you dropping all your money in them? Well, they’re magic internet money and there’s no telling if it will really be worth much.
Ethereum was a noticeable improvement to bitcoin. It also was basically worthless after launch. 
Before there are returns/gains there is no reason to “invest” in a currency.
No one mining in 2009 (risking a whopping 12 cents a day or so) was called irrational or crazy. No one buying 1000 bitcoin for 10 bucks was considered a lunatic. And no one buying in early 2010s for purposes of purchasing drugs was considered this weird irrational dreamer.

Zimbabwe doesn't use their own currency in practice since 2009, and officially since 2015. They use USD. So in your case you'd have like 10k but in 10 years it'd be worth 8.5-9k. It's really bold to say bitcoin will be worth more in 10 years when it hasn't even been around for 10 years. Not saying you're wrong, but that's definitely a leap imo.

You’re right bitcoin could reach 500,000. That’s 50x, not 300x+. 
There’s also no indication that people would trade their gold for bitcoin though.

None of those attributes apply to bitcoin.

That would be the paranoia kicking in lol. 
Bitcoin's price is dependent on more users coming in and finding value in it. Most people that have bitcoins right now aren't buying meth or crack like they were in 2012. If bitcoins become tainted in the public eye the public spigot will dry up and bitcoin will fall to effectively nothing.

Sorry not a couple of days, faster than that. 6 hours earlier in 2013, then 24 hours later in 2013. 
The correlation to market cap is true..:for stocks, and only stocks. The reason is the larger companies typically have larger assets. Apple has 250+ billion dollars in various investments that are entirely independent of its market evaluation. For bitcoin the underlying value of assets is 0 if the perceived value of bitcoin goes to 0. Even if you thought Apple brand/technology etc. had 0 value, it’d be worth about 1/3 it’s stock price in assets alone. 
**It’s interesting you say that the Sp500 has gone down over 60% multiple Times. In fact it literally has never gone down even 60%.** 
And again these crashes happened over months, not a day.

Primarily because it’s currently being used to buy drugs, send money to terrorists and buy hit men.
It also prevents the government from managing the economy, which they are pretty big fans of doing. They actively target 2% inflation for a reason, to disincentivize holding. Holding creates economic slowdown. 
What will happen to Apple stocks tomorrow if all of them were sold? Uh they would go to whatever price the market determines it to be, probably about the same.
What would happen if perception of Apple reached an all time low? Aka massive pedophile ring sanctioned by everyone in the company or something. Stock would decline 60-70% as they have physical assets worth about 30-40% in straight up cash. There simply isn’t a scenario where Apple stock falls below 70% until they get rid of the 250-300 billion + in assets. 
Anyway far more likely is the big bitcoin players with tons of $ in bitcoin want to rebalance their portfolio and by doing so causes a massive sell off.

I'd buy infinite shares of apple at 80 for ex. as that's how much cash they have on hand. I doubt anyone would buy all bitcoins for 1/3 the going rate right now. Or even 1/10th.

Why would they accumulate more currency after options are released? You don't need a lot of currency to tank the bitcoin market. Just flash crash all sorts of exchanges at the same time. They probably accumulated most of their money a while back though. You could throw 10 million at bitcoin in 2013 and get an insane amount of coins. A lot of VCs were doing it back then too (not just the twins).
If bitcoin started going down 1k every minute as you watched, would you buy a ton of coins at 10k (all 60 seconds it'd be 10k)? would you hold all your coins as they drop to nothing? In 2013 people didn't...I'll be surprised if it changes this time around.

Yes, many physical things with utility regardless of speculative value don't crash quickly. Bitcoin is none of those. Market cap really only refers to stocks, but bitcoin has kind of co-opted it. No one would refer to the market cap of the real-estate market. 


Stocks can go to 0, but that's extremely rare for blue-chip stocks and most applicable to penny stocks which are largely speculative endeavors with the hope of massive returns in exchange for massive risk.
What you continue to miss is that apple stock wouldn't have more debt than assets, because it doesn't. My point was that regardless of public perception of a stock, they have underlying value. The few stocks that don't have this attribute are generally extremely risky penny stocks...not the SP500. The same is not true for bitcoin. 


**I literally linked you to an article that discusses every single bear market for the SP500. There are no other crashes. That article has every single crash listed. You can google this shit lol. The SP500 has never had a dip of 60%. Ever.**

Right so what is making bitcoin go up is demand, not the fact that it’s finite. Many things are finite and don’t go up. There’s no property of bitcoin that is making it go up beyond expectation of future returns, which are generated exclusively because of prior demand.

Bitcoin isn’t the best at sending money anywhere in the world. It might be legit the worst outside of obscure altcoins. Ethereum is faster so is litecoin so is iota so is ripple all are lower fee. 
If you just want returns and are okay with saying past returns predict future returns iota absolutely destroys bitcoin. So does ethereum. 
Bitcoin is ancient tech at this point, and the reluctance to upgrade the tech (and the promise of future updates) reminds me of a phone running froyo saying it’s going to get Oreo eventually. Cool, but there are phones out right now with Oreo. 
I hope bitcoin evolves with the times but right now it’s the least capable coin out there.

I’ve thrown out hard drives, and wiped and repurposed hard drives too. Now SSDs are a thing, but historically iirc it was like every year storage would basically double. So after 4 years you could get a 500 gig hard drive for the price of a 60gb one in 2009. Why would you keep a hard drive around that holds like 10% of your existing drive?
These days it slowed down a lot and the utility of smaller drives is still substantial. But back then a small old hard drive was just a good way to make a computer hard to use, and likely to crash and lose all your data.

Yeah and they'd all have been better off if they bought the crypto directly lol. 
The s9 was 2300 dollars ~5 months ago, or 1 btc. If you bought it then, you'd get it around mid-september. Difficulty went from 500 to ~1400. So you start mining and you're getting about .1 btc a month. "Okay not too bad! Just need to mine for 10 months"....but next month it's .08 btc a month. and now it's .06 btc a month. What's coming in the next month or two? 7-10nm chips.  Hey I just checked the difficulty graph and it moved up to 1600! So less than a 1/3rd of what their initial calculations purported. 
If you bought an s9 miner right now for .2 btc, it'd generate .06 btc first month, .05 the next, .03 the month after that .02 the month after that then .01 then it's not profitable. During this time period you'd also spend like .02-.03 btc on electricity. So a bit less than you put in, and most importantly someone that buys in at 10k, and say it goes up to like 30k in a month. He can say "this is insane, I think it's going to crash" and sell. That's what happened in 2013. A lot of people thought it was nuts and sold, and then btc dropped 80% and they could have bought back in for a fraction of their initial investment. 
7nm and 10nm chips coming out in a month or two will make the s9 obsolete overnight. It's crazy to mine with the possible exception of eth mining on a videocard that you were interested in anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:22:00
Erm even if you bought at the peak the last crash was 50 percent over a period of 6 months. Bitcoin crashed like 88 percent in a day in 2013.

Incorrect, you own the right to a share of the company’s income/profit/assets. The company declaring bankruptcy is a pretty big if. What percent of the sp500 declared bankruptcy in the worst crash since 1929? Well under 5%, I think it may have been under 3% even. If you bought at the peak and sold at the bottom you’d be out like 50%. If you sold a couple months before or after the bottom of the market you’d have lost 25%. 
Bitcoin lost more than that in a couple days in 2013. The risks are real, and so has been the reward.

People would still spend money if it were deflationary, but they'd be more inclined to let money sit in banks without being invested in the economy. Overall considered a bad thing for the economy at large. However bitcoin is technically increasing in # and will continue to do so until 2140 so this is more of a future concern.

Having the ability to print more money doesn’t change the overall amount of value in currency. If you printed as many USD in existence right now, would there be 2x as much value in dollars? Or would dollars fall to half of what they were before and the total value in currency globally remain the same? 
60-70 trillion represents the total amount of currency in the world. Most (90+%) of these dollars/currencies are digital so they’re fairly well-established. Physical money is a bit harder to track, especially in more obscure countries.
Why would people hold bitcoins as an investment? The amount of value in currency doesn’t increase nearly as much as the amount of value in other equities. 
If a substantial amount of money were held in bitcoin without it being used as a currency you would only succeed in destroying the economic growth of the world. Having a million dollars underneath your mattress does nothing for the economy. Morning that money to someone to start a coffee shop etc. helps the economy. 
Anyway it’s kind of a trick question because the United States government will outlaw bitcoin before it becomes the currency of the world. I’m hopeful that there is a nation-sanctioned cryptocurrency that crosses borders one day though.

A) If you have a FB group going you just click one button and invite 60 people. Do you want to text or call 60 different people about a party? These are parties, not 4 people meeting up. If someone wants to be invited to parties and intentionally makes it harder to be invited for no real good reason then they should get back on FB if it bothers them that they're left out (and he did).
B) Bitcoin easily could go up 3-10x, or more. It also could go down to nothing. **I'm arguing for the endurance of facebook over bitcoin (statistically speaking) not how much bitcoin will rise or not.** I think facebook is virtually unassailable at present, and see no signs of that changing in 10 years. Meanwhile ethereum almost toppled bitcoin a few months back.
C) Dollars are a digital currency. The vast majority of dollars (90+%) are digital, not physical. No one is cutting paper checks, it's all digital and it's all effectively free (less than 1 dollar a paycheck, often times literally free). Transfers between banks are literally free. 
D) Myspace had a peak of 50.6 million monthly users. Facebook has over 2 billion monthly users. Myspace was never what I referred to as an institution. See? Look at me, not referring to it as an institution. The other thing that facebook is doing is buying competitors up. Instagram has 700 million monthly users, bought by FB.  Whatsapp has 1.2 billion monthly users, bought by FB. If any network becomes popular they'll just buy it before it out-does them, but again they've been the top social network for nearly a decade now without anyone coming remotely close.

Not for the US. Buying ethereum with bitcoin is like buying oil with gold from the IRS standpoint. Most people have had like 100%+ returns here. The effective tax rate would be 7.5% on that amount. If they had 4x gains it’d be like 13%, but 4x gains! If it was 30% then the tax rate would be like 2-3%. 
Pay your taxes if it’s over 600$ people. (I forget why 600 rings a bell, I think technically it doesn’t apply for crypto but the IRS realistically doesn’t care if your total capital gains are under 600). Doesn’t mean under 600 per transaction, just like if you’re a really small fish it doesn’t matter. If you made a bunch of money be thankful that you got super lucky and pay the tax.

Right, which is why a lot of exchanges don't allow people from the US to buy. That being said the US wields a lot of international power and could likely pressure other financial systems to blacklist them if they didn't turn over records for US citizen's transactions on the exchange. 
As you said, it's not worth it for a lot of exchanges to be hassled by the US over a few people trying to dodge taxes.

Sure but 3 months ago bitcoin was 10% of what it is now, and if it returns to that price your miners won't be worth much either. I'm just saying it's a risky investment, but may pay off. More power (you'll  need it heh - bad joke) to you I hope it works out well!

Yeah from nothing to still mostly nothing. It was like 10 cents a bitcoin when he disappeared. If you add a somewhat linear amount of money into a currency it doesn't grow exponentially forever, it decays rapidly. Market cap went up by 500k since early 2009 (btc first invented) --&gt; end of 2010 or about 2 years. Then ~ 1.5 billion until early 2013 or about another 2 years. Then 1.5 billion more to 2015 (okay this is reasonable). Then 197 billion in the next 2 years. Do you see how insane this is? The initial growth was organic, people having fun, using it for actual purchases (I remember when prices were in actual btc). Then shit got crazy and bubbled up somewhat...--&gt; stabilized. Now it's bubbling to an insane degree. More than it ever has before, by a factor of about 100x as much money.
All the bitcoins at that time (like 5 million if that?) were worth 500k. That's like 10,000 nerds chipping in 5 bucks. I can tell with 100% certainty no one thought they were going to get rich at that time. I can tell you that because I've been there since the Pizza buy. Before 2011 it was literally monopoly money like dogecoin was (at the start). Then like dogecoin people took it very seriously and started trying to speculate. 
All that being said I feel like the death of bitcoin as something satoshi would have supported probably came about during early 2013. People were kind of speculating but mostly using it as a currency until 2013 hit and people went nuts. Since then bitcoin has been mostly people trying to get more $ out of it, and becoming extremely reluctant to spend any amount of bitcoin for any reason. 
I imagine literally 99%+ of people buying in right now are doing it because they hope to get to "their moon" and cash out at some insane price. That wasn't what it was about.

Total currency in the world is evaluated around 60-70T. Bitcoin market cap is about .18T. 300x would be 54T. I guess it is more like 350x.

The number of transactions processed is a fixed number regardless of the mining power unfortunately. It's easily the biggest flaw with bitcoin (and maybe 10 min blocks to a lesser extent).
I wasn't saying antminer ships used product, I'm saying they use their own machines during that more profitable window, then ship machines they make later on for far more profit than they'd make if they shipped them initially.

bsave.io doesn't have BTC savings accounts. It seems to be a tether-esque scheme where you give them BTC, they say they convert it to USD and pay out an interest rate on the USD deposited. 
My guess it they are holding the bitcoin and will just go under if the price drops too low.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:39:18
In what way is bitcoin lower cost than USD? Why do you say mining transactions isn’t expensive? If you could double spend dollars, how much money do you think would be worth spending in order to be able to print money as a 3rd party? **If bitcoin became the currency of the world wouldn’t US and China fight to control the network?**
How much does it cost for me to give someone 1000 dollars in-person? 0 dollars. There are fees on top for some companies that offer to facilitate the transaction, but those are independent of the currency. 
How much does it cost for me to send 1000 to anyone in the US? 0 dollars via zelle or venmo etc. how long does it take? 1-5 seconds. Bitcoin used to be okay in this regard. It is now effectiveness useless for day-to-day transactions. 
The fee for every other currency in existence is not “you can set it to 0 and hope it eventually gets confirmed which may take weeks” it’s “there is no way to pay fees ever”.
I say the transaction/scalability is a problem because shitcoins solved that ages ago, and ethereum already does more transactions than bitcoin today. Shitcoins stole shit from bitcoin, bitcoin should do the same!
I don’t think bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. I do think it is being exploited to function somewhat similar to one though. Virtually all posts are about the price of bitcoin or hoping it goes up. It was a very different environment back in the day. I assume it will return to that environment when it corrects but I’m getting bored of tempering people’s expectations and trying to emphasize bitcoin is a CURRENCY not an investment vehicle. Oh well.

Yeah it would have sucked to be able to make mt. gox solvent again. Good thing people lost millions. If you want you can use the ethereum that didn't fork...it's not doing so well though namely because people thought it was a good thing to not screw people out of hundreds of millions of $ for no reason.

2: 0 people were putting houses worth of $ into bitcoin back then. You can tell by the market value being like 200 houses worth of $. 
Most people back then were people that mined bitcoin that were feeling like they should have sold and locked in their gains. Look at 2013 (late) crash. Suicide watch sticky, people saying it will go right back up (it took years) or “don’t sell at 650 it will go up and you’ll miss out” (if they sold at 650 on the way down they could have tripled their gains.

They would be much cheaper, but there are practically no transactions as it stands. If bitcoin actually were spent as a currency there would be like ~1000x as many contractions, even assuming repeated transactions every year you'd still need about 50-100x more transactions per second to cope.
The insanely high price of bitcoin transactions is a huge deterrent, otherwise we'd have faaaaar higher volumes of transactions. So lightning network will help overall, but the fees may be similarly high as bitcoin's use as a currency becomes possible (shitty at 30 dollars a line, but possible) whereas right now bitcoin is literally useless for any purchase under 3000 dollars.

Having mild inflation discourages hoarding of USD and keeps the economy moving.

What about litecoin? It’s worth far less than bitcoin and it’s almost as old, and it’s far faster/cheaper to send things.
Why not Zcash or monero? They are far more trustless and anonymous than bitcoin. 
My point in these questions isn’t to argue these other coins are great, but to say that people buying bitcoin should examine why bitcoin is far more valuable than many other coins that are technologically more advanced. The real reason anyone bought bitcoin in the last couple months is because they want to be rich. 
The tech has been there for ages and no one on reddit realistically hasn’t heard of bitcoin in the last 8 years. Random people may not have heard of it, but for weeks bitcoins crash was blowing up the front page, as was mt gox, or satoshi maybe being revealed.
Bitcoin wasnt some secret any more than Imgur was a secret. Yeah not everyone in the Us knew about it, but basically everyone on reddit did, yet they chose not to buy after it crashed. Years and years at 200ish! Yet minimal buyers. That’s the effect of market sentiment on bitcoin.

I am very familiar with the term capital gains lol. 


No his salary would be taxed as income...because it's income. Not capital gains. None of the stock he sells is ever short term, as all of his stock is &gt;5 years old. He is still, despite your assertion otherwise, paid 1 dollar a year. The salary doesn't really mean anything because his net worth is like 70 billion largely in facebook stock. If the stock goes up 1% his net worth goes up 700 million, aka 7x the highest CEO salary in 2016. Some CEOs take salaries, but founders generally have so much of their net worth in stock it doesn't make any sense to be paid like 5 million.
Capital gains is like you bought bitcoin at 5k, now it's at 12k, so now you pay taxes (0-20%) on only the difference, which is 7k.
It's not income, and short-term capital gains are rarely taxed at 39.6% unless you're making &gt;418,400 to begin with. 
I would start reading some investing books if you want to know what's going on. Everyone starts somewhere after all.

What actually happens is when returns go up, more people buy in, thus increasing returns. When the returns start to slow down (because there is only so much money that is on the sidelines ready to be dumped into a speculative asset) then bitcoin stagnates. Then people start to think well I made a good amount of money and it hasn’t been doing much lately so I’ll sell. Then people say “crap it’s going down, better sell before I lose my gains!” And it goes down further. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:51:35
No, that's the market cap. If someone placed a 20 billion buy order (spread out) over a week or so you'd see a price increase far higher than 10%. The market price is the going rate for any amount of bitcoin, not all bitcoin, and can be shifted without a single additional dollar coming into bitcoin. 
Ex if the US said bitcoin is now official currency, the price would skyrocket, independently of people buying.
If the US said anyone with bitcoin will be arrested or shot then the price would plummet, regardless of people selling.

Yes, but the federal government can print money right? That printing of money effectively reduces or "steals" value from all $ in existence. So printing money is a revenue generator for the government, and decreases value for everyone else. 
Thus it effectively is a tax.
If the government cannot print money, it will be unable to do what it does now. So it will tax people more to pay for the difference. That tax can be exacted from anyone. If you think otherwise, try not paying taxes now and see how it goes. No difference is bitcoin is adopted or not.

40 cents is pretty high, but the market changed somewhat since bitcoin first came out. It's a lot easier/simpler to send $ to your friends without any fees than it used to be. I think 5 cents is a reasonable target...but bitcoin is so far from a currency at this point idek lol.

This chart is not accurate, as it includes an unspecified inflation parameter but **it excludes dividends, which were the source of the majority of gains historically**.
Ex. Sp500 from 12/1/68 to 9/1/82 went from 106.50 to 122.40. Adjusting for inflation it went down by 58%...however it also produced a ton of dividends which when reinvested into the SP500 gives a total return over this period of **-25.825%, not -66.31%**
Similarly from June 1st 1929 to July 1st 1949 you have -61.5% returns adusted for inflation, but **with dividends the return is actually positive 15.047%, not -70.03% as the chart claims.**
The difference is that these days stocks pay less in dividends and more in growth by reinvesting the dividend $ into the company. It's mostly a tax difference.
So the SP500 has not had a dip of that magnitude ever. If you want to be technical about it and include inflation and dividends it still hasn't had a dip of that magnitude ever. Only if you include inflation but exclude dividends (again back then the expectation was that the stock's value was in its dividend mostly) can you generate numbers like that, which don't reflect the reality of the situation. **The bottom line is that someone that put their $ in during the peak before the great depression and held them until just before the massive bull market would have gained 15%, not lost 70% as the chart suggests.**

Can poor people buy bitcoin? The issue is poor people don’t have much wealth as a distribution of society. Bitcoin doesn’t solve that. I guess if you’re one of the like 7 people that were poor and bought in 2009 and held through 2013 to present bitcoin was good for you, but most poor people by definition have a harder time not selling when the price dips because they need basic life necessities.

Wow possible 60% corrections. Get real. That’s like 1-2 months ago. Think 90-100% corrections if bitcoin pops, which it may never do, or may tomorrow. 
Bitcoin is literally purely valuable as a way to generate more value right now. Once the returns drop off (eventually they will, see greater fool theory) you end up having to rely on the inherent value. For stocks that is the company assets. For bitcoin it’s...well. Hmmm. A store of value? That is now crashing? Or is it a currency...with no one willing to accept actual bitcoin because of the volatility, and also no one wanting to use it since it’s going down. 
If Apple stock tanks tomorrow you still have the dividend and you still have the value of the company to back it up independently of what speculators say it is worth. 
If bitcoin crashes all its utility (generating future returns, store of value, usefulness as a currency) also tank. 
That’s why if we see a 60% correction we will see an 80% and then a 90% Etc.

Most people buying bitcoin would fall under the "profit making plan or business" in that people bought bitcoin for speculative purposes. **Remember it is the government that decides whether it was speculation**, or alternatively acquisition of bitcoin **for the purposes of bartering**.

Erm I see the S4 as currently giving a whopping **.1363 bitcoin a year, at a power cost of 1,524 dollars**:  
My comment was that historically you could mine without buying mining equipment those days are over. 
Those calculations are also assuming the difficulty doesn't increase over time. In the past year your revenue decreased by a factor of 4.
The margins assuming the difficulty doesn't change are 1524 electricity, 1581 worth of bitcoins. **So your return on investment goes to 0 if bitcoin declines 3%**. If the hashrate goes down as it has in the past you're more likely to make about negative 1000 dollars running it. Of course that excludes the cost of the miner which appears to be about 300 dollars.
By the time you read this you may actually be losing money if you even run this 300 dollar machine.
For comparison sake:
Say you own a computer with a 300 dollar graphics card. You can make more money with 0 initial capital investment (as you may already want that graphics card). + you can always resell the card if it becomes unprofitable to mine, as it has value outside of mining eth. 
Despite all this, eth is still not even really worth it for most people to mine these days.

You edited your post, I'm well aware it's a stop-loss, hence me using it correctly later on in the comment lol. I was poking fun. 
You said "Your argument goes out the window when I tell you my investment horizon is 20 years, and I already have a stop-loss schedule that would make your head spin."
and I'm saying that all that means is you're going to wait to sell until 20 years, except with your stop loss you might sell randomly when it dips. Ex. bitcoin has had an 80% drop from mid 1000s to 200s before, which would presumably trigger you to sell some of your in an effort to avoid losing $...but then you'd have missed out on your gains as bitcoin eventually went back up to mid 1000s and then some. 
From what I understand you seem to have a bit of a market timing fantasy (see here:  ) coupled with an investment horizon of 20 years (which, given you have a stop-loss, is objectively not true). 
All you're doing is selling bitcoin when it dips, which means you might miss out on future gains...or maybe you sell out before it crashes for good. 
I will say this, there is no "free lunch". Unless you believe you're smarter than top grads from harvard et al. that spend 80 hours a week efficiently pricing in risk/value to all assets (including bitcoin). This is true for any tradeable liquid asset (which bitcoin is). 
The only exception is when there is imperfect information (which is increasingly untrue in the stock market) or more accurately investment opportunities which are not liquid or accessible to many firms. 
Bitcoin is arguably one of the least unique things out there tbh. As an asset there are many analogs. As a technology there are innumerable copies, and to be frank, objectively superior coins. Bitcoin has a value because of first mover advantage. Sometimes that's enough, and it may be true in bitcoin's case, or bitcoin is more agile and successfully adapts, taking good features from other coins...but there is some risk of bitcoin going to 0% which is why it is absolutely rational to sell your coins. It's also rational to keep them.
Most investors here are comically ignorant of how to invest. They don't have price-targets for bitcoin. Bitcoin could go to 50k (with a small volume) and they would still say it's worth buying. Why? Because it went up! Imagine if stocks were purchased in the same way. "Facebook has generated amazing returns, therefore I should put even more money in Facebook!" It's circular reasoning and it's dangerous.
**I can guarantee if a given stock stock doubled (without sound reasoning, an analogous case would be bitcoin replacing USD as official US currency) in trading value all experienced investors would liquidate immediately...but on that's even more reason to hold. That is the issue.**
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:32:04
They can ban it, which would make all legitimate uses of bitcoin impossible. The value of bitcoin during the Silk Road era was under 100.

A new coin can be launched, a new element cannot. Even if no one thought gold had any inherent value, it would have some value. The potential upside for bitcoin is really at most 10-100x, vs 10000+ for a lot o led arguably more advanced coins. So what then is the draw of bitcoin? Perception it will be worth more in the near future due to speculation. 
Bitcoin initially seemed like a better dollar to me, and it eventually could return to that. With transaction time and fees being far higher than it is to send $ it's more like a mediocre version of cash.

If the US wants something banned, it gets banned (loosely speaking). Look at copyright protections around the world. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:30:13
So you think the collapse of the US government is more likely than either crypto being banned and another altcoin being better for anon transactions (which is already the case, zcash or monero). Another altcoin being more successful than bitcoin (eth is like 1/3 the value?) or VISA launching their own coin with financial backing, instant transactions etc. .1% fees (aka less than bitcoin right now).
I think more likely than not bitcoin will be okay, I also think any of those scenarios would sink it like a rock.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:27:26
Probably not much in the case of new gold hitting the market, there already is a good deal of gold, so the price drop would be commensurate with the amount of new gold hitting the market. Most of gold's value is based on speculation not actual worth.
A 400k bitcoin would make bitcoin effectively as big of a deal as US dollars (cash). That's effectively bitcoin "winning", and is a best case scenario. To be frank, no one is actually spending bitcoin relative to the hoarders of bitcoin, so the overall currency is mostly used as a speculative investment vehicle. Can you imagine if people were saying "buy euros and hold!!!" And then say "well no I think the euro has a lot of use as a currency I just never want to spend any euros personally and am interested exclusively in increasing my net worth by hoarding them". 
Ethereum is aboit 40% the market cap of bitcoin. Actually a bit more. Who is to say it won't be the new bitcoin in a year? My point is bitcoins supremacy is entirely in first mover advantage, like MySpace. To compete it needs to evolve far faster than it is now.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:17:33
Well for one thing you can live in your house. Most people buy houses to live in, not make $ off of. Read my scenarios above. If the USA launched their government coin, banned crypto what would happen? You'd say drugs! It would be held and used illegally. Maybe, bitcoin was worth about 20 bucks back then before investing money came in, but honestly I don't think it will even work for that. The shadow brokers are asking for payment not in bitcoin, but in monero or zcash. There are plenty of alternative cryptos with more anonymous features than bitcoin.
I'm honestly surprised at the slow evolution of bitcoin, it's almost certainly the worst coin on the market today feature wise. It's value is exclusively because of first mover advantage. I'm not saying bitcoin suxxx, I'm saying it needs to adopt the more appealing features of other coins or there won't be much point to it in the event that a government makes their own coin or bans it.

SHHH THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE DOLLARS IS BUY AND HODL DUHHH. Also you're an idiot to sell bitcoin at any time for any reason, even if you sell and later buy more bitcoins. No matter what selling (or using it to buy something) is 100% always dumb.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:48:40
What exactly is your point? My point is that selling bitcoin because you think it's overvalued isn't a bad decision, it's just a judgment that can be judged retroactively as good or bad easily, but in the moment not really. If you had 5,000 FB stock right now, would you sell it or keep it in based on past performance? 
If bitcoin's price increased 10-fold, a lot of people here wouldn't sell, even if the increase had no clear underlying reason. In fact, they might buy more! In the stock market this generally only happens with pump and dump stocks, but if it somehow did happen investors would rightly think "even if I like Facebook, I don't think it's worth 5 trillion so I'm selling my stock". 
If you don't have an exit point you're doing it wrong. If you don't consider it "investing" then buy stuff with your bitcoins and don't hoard them. After all, that's what it is right? A currency? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:38:37
What is the chance your bitcoin becomes worth 0 dollars? For most people on that answer is 0%. It's also wrong, there is a nontrivial chance of it happening. 
Bitcoin is in a lot of ways someone leveraging themselves 5x Facebook. Okay, great. You're making a lot of money. But it could end, and realizing profits is not a stupid move. It's just a move. Since we don't know the future of bitcoin, selling now could yield the greatest profit possible, or miss out on a bunch of future gains. Not sure why this is such an odd idea to @_date: 2017-08-25 15:29:42
Right that was my point. If bitcoiners bought stock they'd leverage the fuck out of something like Facebook and be crowing they're glad they're 100% all in on it!!! And act like it's impossible that the one asset class they're ludicrously exposed to could falter. 
I'd never own more than 10% in any given company. No reason to do that with bitcoin either in my mind.

Sell 5-10% at minimum. That way no matter what you realized a substantial profit, and 10% of future gains isn't going to make or break your financial situation. Just my 2 cents.

What about the people that sold at 1000, and then re-bought at 200? Are you "holders" getting what you deserve because you're not making as much as them? Or maybe it's just down to personal risk tolerance/luck and there's not some overarching moral lesson.

The artist example is good, if he can buy art supplies with said bitcoins now we are getting somewhere. 
I think a lot of the appeal of bitcoin was in an era of far higher fees for sending money. 10 years ago I'm not sure how I'd send money to friends. Today I have venmo square cash and zelle, all of which let me send thousands instantly (except square cash now is dumb and makes you wait a day to withdraw it, but it can still be spent immediately with the built in debit card). Zelle goes directly into the banking account in less than a minute, and you can send 25 grand a month for free. WU used to charge like 10%, now it's down to 2-4%. 
Point is it used to be hard to send money, but that has changed dramatically for the better. Bitcoin needs to be faster and cheaper to serve as an actual currency and not as a purely speculative investment. I'd also like to see it either become more consumer/government friendly (aka easier to prevent illegal activity/charge backs for consumers) or less government/consumer friendly (more anonymous like zcash or monero). 
Right now bitcoin seems to be in a weird middle position where it's not that useful for a soccer mom as it's slow and fees are high, kind of hard to track for the government, but still trackable with some moderate effort. So it's kind of mediocre at everything.

The US government bans bitcoin and introduces its own coin. The Us government bans crypto and coins better suited to anonymous activity (monero or zcash or a new coin) becomes the dominant coin used for drugs thus leaving bitcoin no niche. Or VISA coin launches and everyone and their mother uses it because it has transaction times of 3 seconds and lower fees.
Heck ethereum might become more the dominant coin. Aren't they within an order of magnitude of value? Aren't people actually using ethereum for more things? Granted most of those are weird scams but at least it has a use other than speculation and drugs and paying an extra 3% when buying stuff on overstock because the spread is huge and the fees to cash out suck. 
Remember you aren't buying anything with bitcoin if you are converting it to dollars right before spending it. 
600 random altcoins (those listed on coinmarketcap, which itself is a sample of more successful coins) have effectively no value as they are not on exchanges or have so low volume of trading they cannot be cashed out reliably (aka 50 dollars of a coin is bought or sold in the last 24 hours). Effectively those coins are worth 0. The coins that truly are 0 everyone forgot about and it's not listed at all.

Or maybe it was a risky investment that is (currently) panning out. You'd be better off investing in ethereum 2 years ago than bitcoin 5 years ago right? Doesn't mean that you'd be an idiot to invest in bitcoin 5 years ago because you could have invested in ethereum and made even more money. Or an idiot because you didn't buy bitcoin 5 years ago and then sell it and exchange it for ethereum 2 years ago. If you did that I'm sure you'd have like 100M.
All these investments are incredibly risky, with high reward. If you bought NXT (which was a pretty hot coin at one point) you'd be down like 70% today.

Uh, Check local bitcoins for Bolivia and see how many people are willing to break the law. I count 0. Even though Bolivia desperately would want to use bitcoins given their situation.
If you're meeting up in person to buy bitcoins it basically has to be legal or the police will just nab you lol. 
If they make dealing bitcoins equivalent to dealing crack, how many people do you think want to risk selling crack? What about buying crack?
Bitcoin is anything but anonymous, that is why zcash or monero will be more commonly used in the event the us bans bitcoin.
Bitcoin started to avoid .3% credit card fees. Then to buy drugs. Then people wanted to get rich. The first and latter groups won't risk imprisonment to use their bitcoins, and zcash and monero is already taking over the dark markets because they are better suited for that purpose.

Unless you traded bitcoin for an item without it ever being cashed out into fiat, I'd argue you didn't really buy anything with bitcoin. That type of transaction takes place very rarely.
Is a good article on the subject. The first issue is that bitcoin is too volatile to send large amounts overseas period. A 10% swing is common in bitcoin, and if you're sending say 10M dollars to buy a business then you could easily end up in a scenario where you come up short.
Secondly large bitcoin money transfers are currently illegal if you aren't using a money transmitter service. So your question is tantamount to asking if I can't do something without paperwork and break the law. I can, but again it's illegal. 
Also what if you wanted to send money to Bolivia? Or Ecuador? Or Kyrgyzstan ? Or Saudi Arabia? Or Bangladesh?
What if you want to send money to Spain? Well okay fine, but that's actually seen as a barter transaction and subject to 7% taxes! Probably better to just pay a couple percent for WU.
The point is it's different in every country, and ignoring the law allows it to be easy, but again the whole breaking the law thing. 
They wouldn't care about 1k, but if you're sending tens of thousands or millions they'll likely come knocking. Several in the US have been arrested for illegal money transferring operations already. 
**Similarly when you sell your bitcoins for $ you need to pay capital gains tax.** You can get away with it if you're not selling much, probably, but the IRS is going to get its pound of flesh, and anyone at 10k+ in value should expect to pay capital gains on it. 
So in sum:
You can send money via bitcoin if you first pay money to put it into bitcoin, and then spend money on transaction fees, and then pay applicable taxes in country you're sending it to, and then the recipient pays taxes depending on local laws and then pays more money to convert it into local currency to actually buy things, unless it's banned which it already is in 5 countries or so. So I hope you and your recipient have intimate legal knowledge, otherwise you could be screwed. 
Or pay about 1-4% and send money legally with currency conversion with any number of authorized money transmitters.
Eventually crypto will be cheaper to send, as long as it doesn't need to be converted into local currency, the spread is less, the volatility is lower and the government decides not to tax/ban it. Right now it's honestly worse.
If you're sending money and not having to convert currency there is generally no fee at all (look up Philippines to US in USD). I imagine Europe is similar to US in having no fees for domestic transfers, but if not they will be soon.

wow a stop-less schedule,  my head is spinning already lol. An investment horizon of 20 years doesn't change much tbh, except maybe make the result a binary bitcoin is either worth a lot or worthless. A stop-loss schedule is also nothing special. In fact, you're doing exactly what I'm proposing, realizing profit at the cost of potentially missing out on future gains. 
Bitcoin is like any other investment, even the returns aren't anything special. There are plenty of high risk investments that have performed just as well as bitcoin over the last few years.
No risk, no reward. Bitcoin has a lot of risk, so it has a lot of reward.
My point isn't bitcoin sux, or that it's not a good idea to have bitcoin right now. My argument is that selling bitcoin at any point isn't "stupid" and in fact you just said (with your stop-loss schedule) that you'd sell bitcoin under the right conditions. That's good. **The die-hards believe bitcoin is 100% going to the moon no matter what and selling bitcoin at any point is stupid. That's what I am objecting to, and it doesn't apply directly to you (from the sounds of it).**

You're comparing a currency with an investment. Bitcoin doesn't pay dividends or make profit. It's supposed to be a currency but I haven't really heard anyone talk about how much they like to use it, just how much it has appreciated. That's a good sign it's a bubble, as it's not being bought for its use as a currency, it's being bought as a speculative investment.
right now I can send someone a couple thousand dollars for 0 dollars and 0 cents and have it confirmed in under 10 seconds. How much would it cost to have my transaction confirmed in under 10 seconds with bitcoin?
Don't get me wrong, I'm sure some people are rather happy with their returns (if they sold and realized a profit), just remember to sell before people wake up.

Buffet doesn't invest in things he doesn't understand. Are you advocating investing in things you do not understand?

No perfect solutions. I mean cold-storage works, but few people want to leave currency in a bank, and it's not great for the economy if that happens en masse either as the credit dries up. Regulations on the "irreversibility" of bitcoin are rather counter to what bitcoin aspires to be. 
The solution is to not have a lot of money in bitcoin that can be easily accessed. Just imagine you are carrying around however much money in $ that you have access to with your mobile wallet, and that any cold storage located in your home is effectively a block of cash too. If having 100k in cash in your home makes you uncomfortable, the same amount in bitcoin should make you equally uncomfortable. 
Even that doesn't stop the anonymous nature of bitcoins though. Ransom money has to be either delivered in-person, or sent to some bank somewhere where in theory law enforcement could intervene. 
I'm saying some guys in a van could pull up in a van, grab a kid, and start cutting off fingers until bitcoin shows up in the address they control (hope the transactions confirm quickly!) whereas that's far harder to orchestrate in USD as payments are more trackable/harder to hide.

People don't have a large percent of their overall wealth in currency, namely because that's not the purpose of currency. Currency is a way to facilitate exchange of goods and services. You don't need that much currency relative to overall wealth, you just need enough to facilitate transactions between different stores of wealth. 
Plenty of people use dollars, they don't keep 500k under their matress though. They buy stocks/bonds/real-estate/land.

Bitcoin uses 27x more electricity than the VISA network, and on a per transaction basis it is &gt;5000x more wasteful. Regardless of how you feel about bitcoin, that’s a lot of power.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:52:41
??? You mean 10k? That’s the market cap, and it’s not really representative of how much money is in bitcoin. Ex satoshi’s coins certainly weren’t bought for 10k, and a good portion of other coins were bought for significantly less than 10k. 
I meant trading volume is a good relative metric compared to transactional volume to see whether people are more frequently buying products, or buying/selling bitcoin. It’s a bit of a weird distinction but basically all purchases with bitcoin liquidate immediately on the exchange so if there are a few billion worth of purchases in 2017 that doesn’t mean crap when there are 7 billion worth of bitcoins being liquidated on a given day. 
It’s the ratio of bitcoins spent on products vs overall exchange volume that can determine the relative bubble of lack thereof. If exchange volume is 100000x coinbase payments to vendors, most people are probably buying or selling bitcoins for investment purposes, not for buying product purposes. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:30:03

@_date: 2017-11-26 21:26:40
The finality thing is arbitrary for visa, the transaction could be made irreversible if they felt like it, but right now people prefer lower fraud costs by allowing things like chargebacks or payment reversal. 
Maybe I’m missing something but ethereum is a large cryptocurrency (large than bitcoin a year ago) and can support higher transaction throughput. Is that not a real world enough case with 40 billion market cap and tons of transactions every second? 
If fraud increases with bitcoin with 0 confirmation transactions why would anyone want to use it? “Okay take the existing speedy system that works instantly and also has consumer facing features like chargebacks as well as visa bearing liability for fraud with fees of about .5%....what if we replaced that with a slower system that cost more money? Like fees of 10%?”
I remember bitcoin initially was going to open up a world of possibilities with micro transactions and quick low fee payments anywhere in the world. Now it seems to be rather slow and expensive and entirely useless for micro transactions. 
Point is if I want to buy a Nintendo switch or some other moderate but not even very high cost item I don’t want it to be tied up waiting in some store for 20 minutes and people right now steal baby food with fake coupons so people will defraud companies in a heartbeat if they embrace 0 confirmation. 
We will see. I’ve just heard a lot of talk and discussion about segwit and lightning and whatever but at the end of the day it costs way too much and takes way too long to send money compared to ethereum (or really any alt coin, but ethereum shows more real world use as right now it has over twice the volume of transactions and like 1/100 the cost). 
**The worry isn’t that bitcoin will be annoying to use now, the worry is that “visa coin” comes in and says “hey, we don’t suck. We got our shit together and we are fast and intuitive to use” and then VISA owns the crypto market because bitcoin is too slow to iterate. You can make the best foundation ever but if VISA comes in and steals the user base no one will care.**
Right now the appeal of bitcoin to the average American is getting rich. They don’t care whether it’s centralized or anonymous or not. If bitcoin falters and a mainstream company come soon out with a better coin, you’ll get the fast network with all of the strings attached and no one will want or care about bitcoin. It might even be banned.

It's a lot more like cash than gold. Gold has utility. Not just in chemistry, but as a way to plate products and reduce corrosion. It also has use as an aesthetically pleasing physical entity. Dollars exist solely to transfer money around, and most of the dollars in the world are digital anyway.

Bitcoin is actually rather centralized, with ~70% of hashrate originating from china, mostly under nominally independent firms that may or may not really have the same financial backing.

Right now something like 2 billion dollars worth of bitcoin are generated annually. So there will be a hell of a lot of waste and power use if it stays there. You can generally assume worst case all of that $ goes to power consumption (in reality probably more like 80%). If the coins fall down we would see far reduced turnover.
How many people were getting ASICS made to mine bitcoin at the start? If a block were a few hundred, how would anyone justify spending tens of millions on new chip designs? Once prices normalize the incentive will go down dramatically.

As a thought exercise, what can you do today with bitcoin you couldn't do in November 2016? I can't think of literally a single new use or application. Yet the value increased 13-fold. That's a sign the value is purely speculative. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:06:34
This is the right answer. If you can cash out your gains and still come out with a profit, and still have some bitcoin, there’s really no reason to not do it. If the market continues to go up, good, you’re getting returns still. If it goes down you didn’t “lose” any money to begin with. 
The marginal value of dollars decreases, so keeping 100% bitcoin is generally the wrong move vs paying off debt.

You're not really timing anything, say you wanted to buy below 8k over this past week. Well you had 5 opportunities to buy below 8k. Bitcoin crosses over itself rather frequently is the point.
Stocks don't do this nearly as frequently, nor are the swings nearly as large. You argument is valid, but is more applicable to timing when to sell. It's impossible to tell if you've left gains on the table. 
The approach isn't "wait for it to drop a ton" it's more like buying the lowest price over ~3 days of watching. If that lowest price is high, so be it.
I buy stocks based on assets/earnings etc., so the dips/spikes don't bother me at all, because I'm selling years from now anyway. If I think a companies assets are undervalued it's still worth. Without any assets or earnings bitcoins are a different beast though.
People day-trading bitcoin want to buy the troughs because they can sell the peak. 
Anyway in my mind this is predominately gambling at this point, not too dissimilar to stock options.

....no...Maybe you mean western union? If you're curious about the realities of remittance services today see: 
If bitcoin "solved" the remittance problem, plenty of companies would be happy to eat into western union's profits. Unfortunately it honestly doesn't, for many reasons (see article).
TLDR: western union has a market cap of 9 billion, and it has that market cap on the basis of the fees it charges (3-5%) to transfer money. If bitcoin does the same process for less $, you'd expect the market cap to be less...but that also implies bitcoin is a company with revenue and profit, that owning bitcoin entitles you to a share of. In reality bitcoin is a currency, so you wouldn't get the profit from remittances, miners would.

What, VC snatching up bitcoins by the fistful over the past 4 years and people thinking somehow bitcoin isn't something largely relegated to the rich at this point? The winkelvoss twins own 1% of bitcoin lol. It's even less distributed than regular currency. I guess the upside(?) is that some more money was distributed to drug lords.
People that think the financial world is scared of bitcoin haven't been paying attention. Plenty of banks and investors tossed .1% of their portfolio in bitcoin and own a ton of bitcoin. I'm sure they'd be happy to see it continue to rise.

Do you think the public is captivated by stories of someone paying his friend in China 20k and only paying a 10 dollar fee? Or are they captivated by stories of people making millions of dollars and buying sports cars?
The guy you replied to was sayin “I didn’t have money I was willing to risk losing” which is just a statement of his financial situation. 
You replied by saying he didn’t see “the results” but financially bitcoin has already appreciated more from 2010 to 2014/2015 than bitcoin will appreciate from right now to whenever you feel like. It appreciated 10,000x. Bitcoin right now will appreciate no more than 300x if it literally replaced all currency being used in the world. Bitcoin was pretty robust back in 2013/4 iirc too, in terms of networks for using it as an actual currency to buy things.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:36:43
If you think institutional money isn't in bitcoin you're so very very wrong. The winklevoss twins bought in around 2013. Silbert  bought 48k bitcoins. Draper bought 30k bitcoins. All well before bitcoin was close to 1k. 
What you're seeing now is more of a mania/bubble phenomenon where people are less interested in selling and noobies are coming in buying at whatever the market price is because of FOMO. 
It wouldn't surprise me in the least if 20-30% of bitcoins were held by banks right now.

The point is that USD is a medium for the exchange of goods and services. No one ever advocates “investing” in dollars, or holding a significant amount of their net worth in $, and virtually no one does have a significant amount of their net worth in $. 
If USD decreases by even 10% a year, that means 1% of my net worth decreases a year by 10%, for a net difference in my net worth of 99.9%. In reality it’s more like 2%. 
No one is impacted significantly by inflation these days. If they are they’re financially illiterate. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:03:29
Average fee for sending any bitcoin today was about 5 bucks:  confirmation is based on when the next "block" is mined, if you "get in" on the first block which is the best case scenario.
Even with a very high transaction fee so you're guaranteed to be in the next block. There's only a 95% chance that a block will be found in 30 minutes. Probably about 7 minutes average. 
I just compare that to venmo/zelle and laugh. Bitcoin is okay for international transfer, but a laughing stock compared to really any altcoin, or any app for US-based transfers.

But they don’t accept bitcoin, even temporarily. They accept dollars. Bitcoins never even go to them. 
It’s like a company saying they accept Apple stock as currency, and by that they mean they’re okay with you liquidating your Apple stock and paying you the amount in $. 
If the price is in USD, they don’t accept bitcoin.

I mean their main business is kind of advertising, in the same way that Gillette's main business is selling the blades...but they can't sell the blades without the razor/handle. Same way for google. They make money off ads, but only because they spend a great deal of effort offering a good product which can be monetized with ads.
I'm honestly surprised google hasn't made a "google coin" or something. They could accept it for services + offer it as a way to contribute to people on youtube instead of ads or set up recurring micropayments sort of like a mini version of patreon. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:16:33
Anyone keeping significant amounts of their wealth in US dollars is financially illiterate and would be even worse off with bitcoins as they’re likely to panic sell, panic buy, or simply keep their coins in an online wallet. Or lose their coins because they lost their info.
There is an excellent game that teaches how market timing is really impossible by letting you sell once and buy in once over the historical stock market. 
Kind of shocked he’s also against bonds....they do fine in a market downturn even (as long as they’re not high risk/nongovernmental bonds)

How is 150x as a hard upper limit not room to go grow? My point is that the early gains we saw in the last 7 years are literally impossible to replicate moving forward. It’s early in terms of people using it, not early in terms of valuation.

Probably all of them, I’m not promoting anything else, I’m pointing out that not only is an 80% drop possible, a 100% drop is possible. Not likely, but possible. People act like bitcoin couldn’t fall to 20 bucks within a year when it absolutely could.
The reason people value bitcoins so highly is 1: a strong desire to get rich (again, no one talks about investing in dollars or Yen) and 2: expectation of future applications that will be useful.
In its current state bitcoin is honestly pretty terrible. **If anything bitcoin’s utility has decreased dramatically since 2 years ago.** Far higher fees than any of the USD apps, and far slower transaction speed. That will have to change (and it likely will with development of off-chain projects) for bitcoin to have use as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:26:48
er the financial system has plenty of bitcoin. See: the people that bought bitcoins from the government 4 years ago, or the winklevoss twins. There isn't a war at all. 
Literally the only thing bitcoin "disrupts" is western union I guess. Most people don't want to be their own bank and be responsible for losses if they're hacked. People barely can use snapchat and click on dumb emails all the time. "Run macros for derp.exe.doc to see photos? don't mind if I do!"
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:06:31
Bitcoin is far better than USD at nefarious purchases. That's kind of the impetus for its creation (among others). 
It's interesting you say he's early to the party, at what point is someone not early? Coins were 6 cents 7 years ago
4 years ago they appreciated to 1000 bucks, or about a 16,000x return.
Bitcoin cannot appreciate 16,000x today. If bitcoin replaced all currencies (including other cryptos) it would be worth ~150x as much as it is at present.
So on the relative "early" or "not early" It's pretty easy to see he is no longer "early" at all. He's in fact, most of the way through the process.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:44:30

Life after bitcoin “well I. An send you money for 10 bucks, but it might take an hour or two”
Life before internet “I don’t know, so I guess we will never know”

Well apparently the cost to make a VISA transaction is 10 watts...and the cost to make a bitcoin transaction is 200 kilowatts....so...probably using more...
Apparently there are ~150 million visa transactions a day vs 370k bitcoin transactions...so despite that discrepancy in number of transactions we see a 20, 000x increase in power per transaction with bitcoin, for a final total of 1.5 billion watts for VISA, and 7.4 billion watts for bitcoin. 
It's worth noting other estimates put the bitcoin network at a minimum of 1 billion watts an hour, or 24 billion watts a day: 
The swift network is probably 2 orders of magnitude less than the VISA network.

Er, so? If a coin inflates 1% a year doesn't mean much tbh. Point is you'd need to replace all currencies to achieve the total money supply of the world. You can't have multiple cryptos with value if bitcoin is already 100% of the value.

When you spend 10 dollars of bitcoin on any site that accepts bitcoin indirectly through a 3rd party, what you’re doing is selling 10 dollars of bitcoin on the exchange, giving 10 dollars to the company, then buying back 10 dollars of bitcoin on the exchange afterward. The net effect is paying some fees for literally 0 reason.

I mean in the end people want to be able to send money securely in under a minute for under 5 cents. I think that’s virtually universal Among the populace. How bitcoin gets there is debatable, that it ought to get there is not. 
I don’t consider “able to send money quickly and cheaply” feature creep. I consider that excelling at literally the main reason currency exists.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:11:03
Uh you should buy assets then. Currency is not for saving, it’s for transactions. Anyone saving USD with an inflation around 2% or less for past decade is also an absolute idiot. Not just because of the mild inflation, but because they’d have done much better putting that money to work buying land, real estate, stocks, even bonds. 
No one should save in a currency ever. That’s not why it exists.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:58:07
Er what...Look up IOTA. It's basically totally unrelated to bitcoin, both in purpose and technology. Seriously it's no longer the era of "litecoin"
In terms of replacing bitcoin ethereum is most well-positioned right now, and I'd argue that while obviously similar in some regards, it is noticeably different. Most importantly, ethereum is being used right now for purposes bitcoin is unable to fill. Granted, most of them are pump and dump shit-shows, but it's still better than most altcoins that are get rich quick schemes. 
**For bitcoin to survive they need to be agile and adopt new technology.** So far it has shown the exact opposite, which makes me somewhat pessimistic about its future despite being bullish on cryptocurrencies on the whole.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:36:26
As bitcoin continues to rise the upside lowers and the downside remains astoundingly high. Anyone interested in speculative investments would be better off dumping 100 bucks into the top 10 coins right now. Just my 2 cents.

I mean say you wanted to transfer 700 billion a year or so, that means 2 billion coming in every day, 2 billion leaving. At any one point though the market cap doesn’t need to be over 2 billion or so. 
If you’re transferring it and selling bitcoin the market value really doesn’t need to be very high to facilitate large transfers of value. 
Really the only plausible argument for bitcoins price is the network, branding and inertia. 
Bitcoin is one of the worst crypto currencies in terms of its actual technology these days, but the network/branding/inertia isn’t nothing that’s for sure.

Buying back shares is just a way of paying a dividend without making it a taxable thing/out of the investors control, you know that right? 
It’s weird that someone can be bullish on bitcoin, something that is backed by no tangible asset to be liquidated (aka no “minimum” value) but is bearish on stocks. Apple literally has like 30-35% of their market cap in straight up $. It’s impossible for it to fall even 80%. Crypto can fall to 0 easily. 
High risk high reward, crypto is no different.

If bitcoin tanks down to 1k after a while at 8k you'll see a dramatic glut of mining supply and almost certainly a decline in global hashrate/energy use.
The incentives are only so great because bitcoin skyrocketed in value.
If bitcoin were not being held as a speculative investment (and coins were worth like 20 bucks, which is what they were worth when they were being spent instead of hoarded) you wouldn't see industrial data centers worth of miners. After all mining a block wouldn't be that big of a deal.

Two reasons: 1: they actually were arguing a case and if they overreached they could be denied access to anyone. 2: the vast majority of taxes are going to come from the subsection over 20k. The IRS doesn’t care about 200 dollars in gainz, that’s like 40 bucks lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:41:38
Bitcoins market cap is literally 100% consumer sentiment of what it’s worth. Apple for ex. Has a market cap of like 800 billionish (I forget exactly) but they also have 250 billion in straight cash. So Apple’s market cap will never fall below the assets they have to liquidate.
How many assets does bitcoin have to liquidate?
If consumer sentiment soured or people switched to bitcoin cash bitcoin could go to literally 0. I don’t think that’s likely, but people act like it’s impossible. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:05:58
If I make a cryptocurrency with 6 coins, does that make it more valuable? After all, it's rather rare.
Bitcoin's current value is about 98-99% perceived value. Based on what the price was when people were just using it to buy drugs and didn't care about making money off of the next new thing.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:46:36

Why would governments recognize bitcoin as a global currency when they can make their own? Additionally smaller governments wouldn’t be able to trust the security of the network as it’d be this massive arms race between China and the US for hash-rate superiority, causing an insane amount of pollution/energy use. 
The value of dollars is that they’re the only way to settle legal debts with the government. Inflation is a bit below 2% currently. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:00:29
Well the US government can call up many banks and freeze accounts entirely. The vast majority of significant transactions are on the SWIFT network which of course can be monitored.
Bitcoin is like non sequential cash that can be sent instantly wherever you want. 
While there is a ledger, it’s trivially easy to hide your tracks. It’s far more expensive to do so with USD, and leaves more of a paper trail. 
Bitcoin is still not as good as monero or ZCash but that doesn’t mean it’s not better than digital cash. Physical cash is a huge pain to move around. It takes up a surprising amount of space. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:41:12
Not saying they’re a good buy, just saying they had higher gains than bitcoin in the short run. That’s why people buy alt coins, potentially higher return. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:47:25

@_date: 2017-11-27 19:38:09
Okay but you said bitcoin is valuable because of its rarity, now we are back to usefulness...well when bitcoin was used as a currency price was about 20 bucks. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:34:41
Yeah but it’s also well under the exclusion of 5.3M per person, so there’s no real world benefit unless you already have like 20M+. Can do the same thing by buying risky stocks, just as risky though. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:41:55
Yeah I am saying that the same thing applies for stocks. Through options you could generate incredibly valuable (with minimal basis) options and incredibly poor value options. Deduct the poor value options and pass on the high value options when you die.
Unlike bitcoin going up 10x the options strategy works if the stock moves in either direction by any significant degree.
You’d have to know when you were going to die though, but that’s fairly common in some cases (metastatic cancer to brain etc).
You can’t be assured bitcoins will go up 10x or really at all in the near term so it’s not really exploitable.

It's the biggest...idk about a huge margin though. People forget that Ethereum is 2x as large as bitcoin even 6 months ago. 
I haven't heard of any double spend attacks happening in any top 10 coin tbh, despite the hashrate being a heck of a lot less than   bitcoin's. It's just not efficient. The relative security of a coin is entirely based on how user-friendly security features are, and how intuitive it is to use. I'm not worried that bitcoin gets hacked, I'm worried some soccer mom writes her info in a "bitcoin.txt" document in her dropbox. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:01:04
Er, no..It's like you have a glass of water and an empty glass. People are proposing that the empty glass (bitcoin) is worth the current value of the M3 money supply (full glass). That means that wealth is transferred over.
If crypto reaches parity, then the M3 value would be half as much as it is currently (the full glass is poured so that half remains).

A lot of crypto currencies in their current state are borderline nonfunctional for real world use with many low value transactions + relatively low speed. These are fixable problems but whenever I say that around here people act like I am opposed to crypto on principal or want bitcoin to fail.

The electricity costs of...what? The government? Well as much as I think our government is inefficient, it's hard to do less than calculate solutions to problems we didn't need solved...which is what the bitcoin network does. 
The profit potential in bitcoin for miners right now is so high it justifies absurd uses of electricity. If value of coins dropped we'd see some sanity, or if the number of coins generated dropped. Either way, there's little reason to have so much power being used when no one is trying to screw with the network.

Back then it was more of a gamble? You think it’s  less of a gamble now, after the price increased 10 fold without any fundamental change in network technology or increased use of bitcoin relative to 2016?

you know someone in the 3rd world that’s disabled and has a billion dollars worth of bitcoin? 100k bitcoins that he bought somehow before an exchange showed up in his country?
You know who probably has the most bitcoins right now? Not your made up poor person in a 3rd word country, the winklevoss twins. Or the many venture capitalists that got in early. 
It’s an interesting story, but the vast majority of wealth (99+%) is not in currency at all. It’s in land and companies and housing. America will continue to be on top until China overtakes us eventually. 
Google “people with the most bitcoin” and you’ll see it’s virtually all venture capitalists. Not exactly surprising an internet currency is confined to those in the 1st world. Especially those with 100k to drop and no immediate need to sell off debts.
All this being said, I think you may be genuinely mentally ill. In all honesty I would consider calming down for a moment and reassessing. You’re either ignorant or delusional of the financial realities of the world. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:05:25
20k in any 1 type (receiving/sending), the aggregate over a year. Not just 20k in a single transaction. Probably won’t apply to many people though. 
Also note even  if the IRS doesn’t go after people, it is the law. 
Ex. virtually no one reports online purchases to get taxed more locally, but that is the law. Probably not a big deal unless you bought thousands and thousands of stuff every year without being taxed. 
Point being if you’re up there in the 10k range every year might want to pony up. If it’s long term gains it’s not likely to be that significant a bill, and while the IRS is pretty rough with people that didn’t pay their taxes when they catch them (if it appears intentional/significant) if you come to them they’re apparently very flexible and accommodating.
I wouldn’t worry unless I was in the 10k range though, up to you though.
Side note: you can also claim losses if you sold bitcoin at a loss

Nah that's the exact same. If I wanted to send someone 10 million dollars with bitcoin I could do it back then just like I can do that now. I guess moving multiple billions of dollars quickly...but that's not exactly a typical-use-case and I don't see many people doing that right now either.
Rest of what you said is the same too. Bitcoin is just as decentralized (actually it's arguably more centralized with china controlling the majority of the hash rate, and individuals having virtually 0% share of mining).
What can I use bitcoin for that I can't use $ for? 
 Buying drugs and sending money overseas quickly for a low fee. Nothing new since 2012 in that regard. As a consumer you could buy stuff on overstock etc. in 2014. Nothing really new since then in terms of adoptions either.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:25:25
5 satoshi a byte is very low. Not just next block, but like next 30 blocks. Right now the fee to be confirmed within 6 blocks or so is 129 satoshi/byte. **Even 60 minutes is extremely slow.**
Hell even 10 minutes is rather slow for day to day use. I can’t imagine waiting that long when buying stuff but if they don’t wait for the confirmation they are opening themselves up to fraud. 
I’m not concern trolling for other coins, I’m saying bitcoin should address this because it’s a problem. Problem is no one wants to change anything so we are using 2009 era technology in 2017 basically. Altcoins took what bitcoin is and generally made desired tweaks (most of them were to just make money in pump and dump but still). No reason bitcoin can’t adopt some of those tweaks.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:54:10
Honestly 100 dollars won't change your life much if it goes up to 100k/coin, and that's a pretty big if. You'd then have about 1,000 dollars. There will be a correction anyway so no reason to worry about this in the near-near future. Even if it's going to the moon we'll see a pullback with almost 100% certainty before then.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:04:28
Look at the original post, it’s suggesting Tesla accept bitcoin via coinbase. They’re not holding any bitcoins at all. The limits in place for withdrawing cash also apply to making payments to others. You’re effectively selling bitcoin in a round about way. It makes bitcoins slightly easier to spend, as you don’t have to go to the exchange, cash out, and then spend, but from the business perspective there is literally 0 difference. 
In sum: all those services do is facilitate easily selling bitcoin for the requisite amount of $, they don’t help the ecosystem because businesses still receive $, not bitcoin, unless they explicitly want bitcoin in which case they wouldn’t need to pay coinbase for 0 reason (and it also of course is impossible to do business with bitcoin at present as the volatility is insane). 
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:35:05
1.17 dollar is an insane fee for sending 15 dollars. VISA would be 0 dollars for debit, or 30 cents for credit (and the consumer would get approximately 15-20 cents in “rewards”) for a net transaction price of 10-15 cents

I guess my point is if it seems like bullshit the government is fine with detaining you forever. Honestly it seems kind of insane to me on some level but idk. It does sound like this guy was a pediphile based on testimony from a relative saying they saw a video on his PC of CP, so I don’t want this guy near schools etc...but jailing him indefinitely also seems like a bad precedent to set for not decrypting hard drives. 
But my point is that this is the precedent being set right now. Don’t remember the password? Too bad. Jail until you do.

So you should spend money to transfer bitcoins to a payment processor for a merchant. The payment processor then pays money to sell the bitcoin. The payment processor then spends money to send usd to the merchant. Then you spend money to buy bitcoin, and then more money to transfer it to a wallet.
Does that not seem....really dumb to you?
If the merchant accepts bitcoin directly (without any processors) then it makes sense.

two dozen? Bitcoin has only had a few serious crashes, early 2013 (but not really since it declined for like a day before coming back up), late 2013 (absolutely) and now. The crashes before are irrelevant. No one was putting their savings all-in on bitcoin at 30 bucks. 
I don't think it's a useful tool, it's mostly amusing because it reflects internal thought processes very accurately.
Anyway, there have only been a few serious corrections, so I have no idea why you think you can say it won't stay down forever, or go back up immediately. We just don't know. If we did, we'd be billionaires.
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:09:12
Yeah...but bitcoin objectively cannot increase in valued an order of magnitude every year indefinitely. It recovers, spikes, crashes...until it doesn't. I'm hopeful for the crypto space, but it always works out great until it doesn't.

If bitcoin either gained 10% or lost 5% a day it would be incredibly volatile despite trending upward. The volatility prevents it from being used as a currency in practice, because you can’t assume your 10 bitcoins in sales will be able to pay for supplies in 6 months.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:12:40
Some people mortgaged their house. Is it stupid? Obviously. Did people saying bitcoin was absolutely going to 40k later this year + constant sensationalism fuel the speculation and shitty investments? absolutely.
Having a thing saying "only invest what you can afford to lose" quickly becomes about as helpful as a EULA everyone sees and clicks past without reading.

I mean under the hypothetical scenario bitcoin replaces the US dollar the people that would lose most are people that have a lot of cash on hand. This wouldn't be rich people, as generally the vast majority of their wealth is invested in assets (aka if you own a few apartments they're going to be worth the same regardless of bro to usd exchange rate). 
I'd say most of the "losers" are people that are buying bitcoin now with a large portion of their savings, then panic selling as it dips. Most people here can't even make up their mind if bitcoin is a currency or an investment, and are comically ignorant of basic economics.

No, you haven’t. Not even close. 2 years at 1% a day would be a 1,400x return. 3 years would be about 54,000x return. Bitcoin was going for 200 min for all of 2015. Even if you sold at 20k exactly you are not even close to 1,400x returns.

Not always true regarding free services. Sometimes it doesn’t cost all that much money for the service, so you can offer it for free in exchange for something small. Ex robinhood gives you free stock trades (and crypto). They do this by collecting the overnight interest on your spare cash. It’s not a lot of money but the costs to initiate trades is minimal as well.

Well, no. They offer 0.12% yearly (
Yeah so 0.12% of like .1% of your total investments is what, .00012% yearly? Very exciting! For a lot of people on robinhood their free cash is literally about 12 dollars lol. 
Jeez lol. You took this (correct) line to be suspicious if something is free, and took it to the limits. Robinhood can make a trivial amount of money off your float and that's enough to cover their costs. They don't need to fuck you to make money.
Believe it or not all companies are trying to maliciously fuck you as hard as possible, because that doesn't make money as much as offering a service for a reasonable cost, whether or not that cost is recouped by charging you 3 cents a day or collecting interest on your cash float.
All you have to do is determine how they make money, and whether that's acceptable to you. I'm fine with robinhood taking the pitiful interest it receives on my spare cash in the account. I'm fine with venmo trying to read between the lines on my "pizza" purchases that are never for actual pizza.

Lol what, most brokers I’ve used collect $ from your overnight float. I understand the origin of the phrase, but some things cost an amount so small in a way you couldn’t capitalize on it anyway. Ex. Overnight interest is like, .0001% of your free cash.
You can buy like various .2% a year generating cash-like but a lot of people just leave the money in the account as random free cash which doesn’t earn any interest. 
There’s no such thing as free is most applicable to services like google offers. Significant cost for google, and significant need to make money off of you as a result.
What I’m saying is that for some article some random ad can pay for the cost to load it up for you. Venmo is also free. They don’t make much money off of you, but they don’t need to. The price of transferring money and buying stocks is ludicrously low. Like less than a penny low.
