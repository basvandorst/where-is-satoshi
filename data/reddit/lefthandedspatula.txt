I upvoted you, but I think I disagree. Credit cards have a complicated backbone: very few people actually know how a credit card is processed, but that doesn't mean they can't use one.
I expect that innovation will eventually result in hardware and phone apps that are very easy for people to pay with Bitcoin. It's a complicated system, but I think with the right implementation, it has the capacity to be grandma-friendly.
Imagine: Grandma walks into Starbucks to order a chai latte. She turns on her phone, presses the Bitcoin icon, and holds it up to a NFC pad on the register. The transaction is communicated to the device, and the device initiates a transfer. A copy of the transaction is displayed on the device until the screen is shut off or grandma exits the app.
Pretty simple. In fact, I think it's far better than credit cards, because you save paper from receipts, there's no fumbling with pen and printing and signing, and grandma is none the wiser to the mechanism behind it.

They stopped talking to you? What an odd reaction. I can't even imagine why someone would react this way.

Thanks buddy!
Was that accidental or did you know it was me?

Right, an example for OP would be ButterflyLabs. They have orders from JUNE 2012 that haven't shipped yet.

Oh man, the amount of hindsight in that comment thread is painful. It's so easy to say "I wish I had gotten in!" as if this guy won the lottery, but none of them are making the effort to invest, get involved, and do the research.

Most users write their own. They collect the trade data, perform trend analysis, then use a built in api on btce or mtgox to have the program or script make trades based on your instructions.

And another six from me!

A friend and I worked on one together. He wrote it and I gave some tips on math, trend analysis, and provided testing. We've since closed the project because risk was so high. I imagine you could find one on a bitcoin forum or something, but don't use it unless you know what you're doing and have nothing to lose.

I saw. It would appear you made a shotgun and stuffed it with bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-29 20:06:40
Exactly. And if that were the case,  these people would say "gee I'm glad I wasn't so stupid as to invest in that." Hindsight is always 20/20.

I suspect many of the micro trades are being preformed by bots. The bot I was using did similarly sized trades.

I agree immensely. Bitcoin is viewed as this freeing currency that will be our savior from corporate greed and socioeconomic imbalance. I've feared the opposite for quite a while. I think, if anything, Bitcoin will make it worse. The rich will have a great way to hide their wealth from taxation and regulation. It will be difficult to maintain, regulate, and control wealth, which (although many would disagree) ultimately benefit the middle class and poor more than anything.
That said, I'm amazed at every other aspect of Bitcoin. I don't think Bitcoin will ruin our economy, but I do think our world society has some problems to work out in its regard. Until then, I'll continue to use it in its intended form.

I don't know, I think there is potential to have serious conversation still. Maybe I'm too optimistic. I feel like we should make it clear what our concern is and what we expect of this sub. Good moderation will certainly be needed. I'd like to think this is a passing influx of users who are unfamiliar with the existing culture, and we can steer us back around with a clear message. Good users leaving in a huff will certainly not help this place.

What do you mean? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:21:39
I enjoyed the thorough analysis and insight.

I speculate that it's the end of the school year and a bunch of people find out they failed or won't graduate.
