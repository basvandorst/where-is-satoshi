I have been trying... but MtGox won't take my calls

As a guy who lost 10 BTC to MtGox and not expecting any BTC  back, this warms my revenge fuelled heart.

I had multiple Wave Crest cards in 2017, but there were all shut down due to my Residence (Canada). I found one that works for Canadian residents: Wagecan. The approval process is shifty as fu but it works. I have done multiple topups and have used it in numerous countries. They take BTC and Bitcoin Cash.
The pros: It is the only one I have found to work in Canada.
The cons: The exchange rate is always $200 or more off on CMC &amp; the card issuer charges 1.5% for all non Hong Kong $ transactions.
Until something better comes along or I change residency, I will continue to use it.
If you want to sign up, use my reference and we both save some $

Mt-gox held my funds for 2 weeks and then released them friday evening (7:30 pm Japan time).....  strange time to be FINALLY releasing the funds, I thought.  But maybe they had a motive...  maybe they held the funds of many users desperate to buy BT... I dunno... any other users of mt-got had the funds released friday evening?

I am a huge believer of the value of Bitcoin as an investment and as a future worldwide currency that can rid the financial  monopoly of the global ecobomy by  bankers. But looking at the timing and constant complaintsby customers of slow transactions from Bitcoin dealers I cannot discount the trend that it  looks like bitcoin websites like mtgox  are manipulating and abusing the captital of their clients by having comtpkete control of their clients funds for an incredibly long time.... and in that time could use the funds in any fashion they wanted..... Including buying and selling bt short term or even accruing interest in a savings account..... oh and bt is down 200 $ in 12 hours to  $980.  That is a huge flutter, down.
