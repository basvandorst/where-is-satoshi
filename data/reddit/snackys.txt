So are you going to risk wearing out equipment for almost no money? Even if you could get it to somehow get some unoptimized software running you are better off collecting change on the street instead of being wasteful.

I've been checking Bitcoin related sites  since 2012-2013 during the mtgox era. Love the technology, owned something like 15-30 when it was less than 10 bucks a pop. Burned them through illegal gambling sites and to this day I'm not upset I didn't keep them or anything. Hell the mindset from then to now would of led me down a very bad path of thinking and investing. But sideling Bitcoin for this long I really don't like how it's been since it broke the grand a coin. Progress seems like it halted just for hodling pump and dump memes. 
That and if I had the couple of extra thousands, yeah I'd have a house by now but going the traditional job route I'm only a year or two away from that. Mentally, i would probably be in a worse spot if I kept dickriding Bitcoin till now.

I've only been visiting this subreddit for a few weeks now and I can already recognize your account name is tied to shit posting.

Thats a real low quality petition, please remake a better one.

There shouldn't have been an option NOT to pay it.
The point of these machines is convince and to get people on board. If there is new users it should educate.

Just start going through the usual cleaning routine.
Also you should be using an internet browser with noscript and add block

To some sellers, I rather pay the sellers fee and get my product to the biggest public then cut sales for 10%. For others, saving 10% is fine and even better, but for me it isnt.
Also you shouldn't run with margins close to 10%, if thats the case.

From some friends i have who are on sponsored teams, most of the advertisement you will spend on that team will be spent promoting in their streams. More often than not you can find many popular lol streamers doing "sponsor giveaways or events" to promote. Same can be said for DoTA and their top streamers.
Starcraft have been falling off the ball lately, if you wanna go with a blizzard game you should check out some of the hearthstone players/teams.
While tournaments are short-lived and the fame only has a "in moment" effect I would consider sponsoring a team or popular streamer.

Its just a simple bug for getting past parental control.

Translates to: Although there is a vulnerability, we can see no accounts have been accessed from unauthorized users.
I'm pretty sure they keep ip logs for this case. Article doesn't even confirmed any loss whatsoever.
Stop misleading like this article.

Have you considered the other way around?
I'm not even a bitcoin investor, nor own a single fraction of a coin. I just come to read articles and form my own judgement.
Don't you still have more doomsday posts to worry about?

Jesus Christ what horrible shilling you have in your post history.
@_date: 2019-03-06 05:01:33
Well his history shows a pattern where he finds a random subreddit a week, asks a really awkward question, then shills his 700 view YouTube AMV of American cartoons.
Look through it, hell even and made a unrelated bad meme picture just to make a spam post. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 23:46:23
Step 1: find a subreddit
Step 2: find a reason to post a problem that involves the title of the subreddit (could be bitcoin, finance, or sex) and relate it to these superhero movies
Step 3: shill your YouTube channel SO CLICK THAT LIKE BUTTON
did I get that correct @_date: 2015-03-06 23:28:21
Personally i would use a different word then retarded. Makes you sound childish and it keeps the argument at that level. Ignorant is a better word.

What they were doing were giving prescriptions and cards that "only work at xxx dispensaries" which is bullshit and illegal. These clinics worked with dispensaries to make this illicit program and they got busted for it. The simple way to check now is that the California government website for this prop has a master list of certified and verified doctors who gives legit prescriptions.
