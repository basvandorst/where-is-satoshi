why do you only hodl? why don't you invest yout bitcoin and let is earn money why you wait?  
why would I trade myself if I can earn 10% and more per month by having experienced traders doing what they can do best?

doesn't matter. have it earn money while you hold it and you will have the fees back on no time :)

it is about risk. If you are good at trading or have great traders at hand, trading is the best way possible to make money, be it bitcoin or forex. or you find someone who runs such trades and get nice paychecks every week :&gt;

that is exactly why you kep buying and investing your BTC. I'm for sure not waiting for my pension to profit from Bitcoin :O

as long as it keeps paying me half of my salary every month they can say whatever they want :D

really do not care about it. less bitcoin on the market -&gt; higher value.
with all the weekly profits, I'm quite happy if they keep BTC at least stable at the current price.

that is why we happily keep buying and investing BTC to make even more money from it :)

ignore them. invest your BTC, let it earn money and slam it in their faces :)
