Hey Meni! I'll be in Tel Aviv this summer- can I come to your party?
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:49:50
Nope, I think that's just as blindly dogmatic as the people who will retweet anything somewhat bullish. I'm a realist.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:13:55
[Do your research](
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:19:43
Out of all of the perfectly valid things to not like about crypto, you chose the most pedantic and insignificant.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:28:41
This is after pushing back on numerous aspects of the initial regulation. 
Maybe sitting in your couch surfing reddit you think that these guys should just flip off regulators and ignore them, but that's not how the real world works. When you lead an industry, you can decide an appropriate way to deal with legislators.
The fact is, crypto has gotten a bad rap, and would be harmed immeasurably if people like Barry didn't step up to work with and educate legislators.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:50:42
What questions? 
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:58:55
Thanks, I try to be level headed.
Theo is a great man and I had somehow neglected to look at his username before responding.

Your post history shows that you are a troll, and not a particularly good one. In case you couldn't tell, this picture is a joke, and your comment literally added nothing to the conversation.
**Edit**: He edited his comment - it originally said something about how Ethereum has no future and is worthless, which clearly is completely irrelevant since the post is a joke about clueless twitter sheeple.
**Edit 2**: He edited it again. I take it back, we're dealing with a professional troll here people!
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:36:48
Just spout some obscure physics concepts you found on Wikipedia and make a poorly thought out analogy to bitcoin. 
It's a pretty straightforward formula.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:27:49
He never implied that ethereum has a future, his whole point is that you can throw together some vague bullish crap on twitter and people will jump all over it like piranhas.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:50:44
I apologize Theo, I am familiar with your work and am a big fan. 
I will have to respectfully disagree on some points, but you definitely do a lot for our community and industry.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:05:21
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:32:41
That is the entire joke. Make some vague bullish statements, people desperate for confirmation bias try to spread it for those sweet gains
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:10:46
Barry is a legend, and history will remember him as someone putting an immense amount of effort and laying his reputation on the line to further an industry. 
What you read on twitter, or reddit, or some dude's blog post, is not a fair or accurate representation of reality.
It is extremely easy to vilify someone you've never met or spoken to on the internet, but Barry is surprisingly low-key and sincere in person.
@_date: 2017-08-11 05:59:18
It represents shares in a trust backed by bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:57:35
See the edit on my comment
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:45:51
Yes and "BIP-148" in your name. Unless you're part of the weird trippy Desantis corner of crypto twitter, then you need an Urbit "~".
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:26:07
Yes, that is his name and position... What's your point exactly?
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:37:52
People in crypto like cryptic, vaguely bullish statements.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:31:06
Wouldn't exactly call it digging, just wanted to confirm my suspicion that he was a troll
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:29:36
...you're still linking to it

Enlighten us

So large time frames do not exist, thanks for the helpful contribution
@_date: 2019-04-12 02:17:23
You should also know that all bitcoin transactions are permanently publicly available so if a law enforcement agency links your son’s “public key” (basically an ID) they can track every transaction he makes 
Also, idk if this has been mentioned but this btc address seems to be connected to them: 1BjxEo8ynLLABXwJ1UYFBP6zaFi8zLmyoA

Unlikely :/
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:44:41
Nah that's actually perfect because I'd like to double down on bitcoin and forget about altcoins, and trading less actively so I can afford to sacrifice convenience for security. Many thanks
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:45:17
Yeah this makes no sense. If they were only $21 million each one would be worth a hell of a lot more than a bitcoin

Investing for profit has little to do with adoption. In fact, they're probably mutually exclusive to some degree.

Depends what you classify as [money]( but sure it's more of a general illustration than accurate depiction.
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:47:10
This guy went straight from shitting on it to jumping on the bandwagon. His opinion is next to worthless, and all this statement will do is attract inexperienced investors who wouldn't have invested without a celebrity telling them what to do.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:46:43
You’re saying “of course” as if it’s reasonable and fine, but it’s full-on fraud.

If you don't know enough to immediately recognize what kind of chart this is, I question whether you understand enough to be investing in something this risky.
No one with even moderate investing chops will get misled because they either know the chart already or are smart enough to check the Y axis.
