From a post I made earlier, but keeps getting [removed] by mods:
Let me explain to you why merchants accepting Bitcoin (or in this case fiat through Coinbase) won't pump up the price for you to cash out for what you originally paid.
 
What I look for in a potential cryptocurrency are these attributes:
 
* Anonymity
* Immunity to regulation
* Immunity to fraud
* Immunity to speculation
* Nil or very low fees
* Fair distribution
* Resource efficient
* Serves multiple purposes (i.e. processing contributes to medical research)
 
Bitcoin has none of these attributes, and that is becoming even more abundantly clear with developments such as the steps taken by the state of New York.
 
It's just a shitty prototype of fiat (like fiat, but starting from scratch!), with the exception of not having the anonymous benefits of cash - making it Big Brother's wet dream.
 
It appears to be a common misconception amongst Bitcoiners that if the big companies start accepting Bitcoin, or fiat from centralized Bitcoin payment processors, then adoption and consequently also the price will rise.
 
In orther words, Bitcoiners believe that if they can spread the word around enough, the more bagholders they'll be able to ensnare and dump on.
 
However this is actually both too simplistic and wrong. Just because something reaches a person's ears, that in itself does not convince them to buy it.
 
I know about Runescape party hats, and I know they increased in fiat value massively in just a few years, but that didn't make me want to buy one.
 
The same with Apple products. I simply don't like Apple products, and they're expensive as well. I'll never buy one, even though they're extremely popular and renowned.
 
Do you see where I'm going with this? Just because a merchant accepts Bitcoin, it doesn't mean you're going to get new people jumping on the bangwagon. They will only do that if they see benefits in it over using fiat, or if they can get rich quick. And no, temporary 10% off coupons will not do. In my country, Ebay is having 20% off tomorrow if you pay with fiat - so there's nothing unique about temporary offers designed to bring in new customers.
 
I hear a butthurt Bitcoiner ask, 'why would Dell accept Bitcoin unless they believe in Bitcoin growing and making us all get rich quick?'
 
The reason should be fairly obvious. They just want to get more market share and jew more money. They're not even accepting Bitcoin - they're accepting fiat from Coinbase, and Coinbase sell the Bitcoins back to the open market.
 
If an element of the market (even just 1% say) suddenly popped up and expressed publicly 'I'm willing to pay through the nose for anything, so long as I can pay in muh Bitcoins!!!', wouldn't you take advantage of that if you could get it converted to fiat before you complete the sale of the product anyway?
 
In fact, having more merchants accept fiat from Bitcoin payment processors may have the opposite effect of what you desire. This will mean that Bitcoins which would normally remain as a bagHODLing, will now be dumped on the open market, thus driving the price down even further in an already bearish market.
 
Don't believe this entire post? Not to worry, there's at least one fact I think we can all agree on - the price and number of Bitcoins bought has barely nudged up since the news a few hours ago. For perspective:
