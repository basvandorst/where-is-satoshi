Just won the lottery, because I bought the winning ticket 3:43 AM on Tuesday. Everyone will win the lottery, regardless of when or where they buy their ticket.
^ That is the flaw in your argument.

Less than a day, actually...

For a cup of coffee it is insane, for a bitcoin or two, well, the price fluctuates that much in seconds, so it is not insane.
To get back to that cup of coffee, we need a LN like alt-chain to handle small purchases with immediate confirmations.

Now is a good time to transfer to a SegWit account, because fees are very VERY low at the moment (5-10 satoshis).

The moral of the store is to never store secrets on an Internet site.
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:49:59
The issue is that for the cost of 2 bitcoins, 200,000,000 (no fee) one satoshi transactions can be added to the mempool. I am wondering what the net effect of this would be.
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:10:38
How is it that that chain is not currently under spam attack? I still don't get it.
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:19:23
Sure, but the time for confirmation is a different matter altogether.

If he HODL'd them all, he's probably retired right now.

You don't need to wait a couple of days, just 8 more hours when BCH difficulty will increase 300% and all of the miners will move back to BTC.

In the world of buying a can of pop with a QR code.

And there is a message there that was just posted in Russian.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:15:11
The biggest mistake you made is storing any secret info on the Internet (i.e., Evernote).

FUD award of the day.

Ask yourself this: Who's mining it when it is less profitable than mining BTC?
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:36:30
It will just fall on all of the other farms outside of China, that's all.
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:25:05
Also, "majority minor support" is irrelevant if China bans bitcoin mining.
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:39:12
This is exactly why all we need is faster Segwit adoption and not another hard fork (for the short term).
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:19:43
Well, they have given a warning, but the affected parties are ambiguous at this point (i.e., will mining be banned too?). They may give another more specific warning or more clarity to the current one, but there is no guarantee of that. It seems to me that mining will be banned in a matter of months, based on what we know right now, unless the right party officials get bribed and this whole thing turns around.
One thing not oft-mentioned here is the effect of the 19th National Congress meeting of the Communist Part of China that is happening on October 18th (and all of the political posturing leading up to it). That is the real next big date to watch in this whole debacle. Current Chinese leaders want to show that they have a reign on the control of the value of the domestic money supply (e.g., via currency manipulation, etc...) in order to continue to stay in power.

Wait until you receive change for your transactions right back into non-segwit addresses.

Stupid question: Would it be possible for Core to update bitcoin to completely block this whole asic boost thing with something short of a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:26:22
This! People seem to be ignoring the fact that any core BTC client will reject those big blocks.
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:05:52
Bitcoin generation and solar go hand in hand. I am surprised noone has realized this yet. The biggest problem with solar is to transfer it out of desert areas. If, instead the power is transferred to bitcoin mining, there is no need to move the power - it can be utilized in place.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:12:32
I've heard of Bitcoin, who is John Cena?
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:12:00
So, holding steady at 2.5%, then?
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:36:10
Reallocation sounds logical, but I think China already put a stop to important people leaving the country. Also, there may not be other locations that have cheap and underutilized (geothermal) power readily available, especially on short notice.
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:30:44
85%+ of miners is a figure that is about to be greatly reduced if almost 100% of those 85% are in China and China bans bitcoin mining.
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:37:58
This! Also, add to that the fact that Core is not saying that they will never increase the block size. They just don't want to do it in three months.
@_date: 2015-04-09 21:40:13
Don't start a startup without doing the research. This is the main reason why 95%+ of new businesses fail.
