I notice that you are not discussing Asset Price Inflation. The numerical increase of Bitcoins in circulation must lead over the longer term to Asset Price Inflation, whether assets traded are concrete or intellectual. 
It seems that Bitcoin is viewed as an asset/ store of wealth, so its very value will fluctuate, depending on the quantity of Bitcoin traded. For example, if every owner of Bitcoin decides to hold his stock in reserve, owing to a rising price, the offered price of Bitcoin will spike due to drop in supply. This is the anomaly of "stores of wealth", they do not actually store "wealth", but are simply barometers of market forces. 
The answer must lie in a meta-currency: wealth increase is a parameter of the increasing efficiency of an economy. We have to move past measurements based on "asset value", whether those assets are Bitcoins, Dollars, Gold or Debt. If Bitcoin increases the efficiency of the economy, its value is evident therein. 
So yes, Bitcoin is likely to hold more intrinsic value than fiat currency or debt. I think efficiency increments should be the parameter measured to reflect the increasing "wealth" of a nation. Academics need to measure efficiency gains made by Bitcoin communities versus like micro-economies that trade with traditional exchange mechanisms. If those efficiency gains do not exist, the virtual currency is worthless.

In Poland, if you want to deposit a Pound Sterling cheque in your Polish current account in your own name, banks charge you 6% and you have to wait for 3 months.
