Bitcoin should not be considered an investment. It is a currency and a store of value. We want users, not people who buy with the expectation the price will go up.

As far as I know electrum only lets you sweep private keys, not spend from them. So this would require two transactions - one to import into electrum and another to send from electrum.
Edit: I was wrong. See RyanMAGA's comment below.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:07:00
You are absolutely correct. Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:54:22
And electrum. The issue is moving all your coins from a non-segwit wallet to a segwit one can be expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:37:47
If you use the Bech32 format you need to sweep your private keys (so probably of no help if your coins are in Coinbase). You can sweep more than one privkey at a time and if you have Electrum 3.0.3 it allows you to alter the fee when sweeping.

Although it is open source there is no guarantee the binary you download from Google Play is compiled from that source code. I would only use an app from a well known developer with a reputation (eg Mycelium). Even then I would be uncomfortable storing too many bitcoins in addresses a pre-compiled app has generated.

Coinpunk also requires you to upload a photo. The only method for in-browser QR code recognition I can think of is the getUserMedia API which is not currently supported on iOS.
An alternative is to bounce the user to a QR scanner app which recognises the code and passes the data back to the web site.

Looks really nice. If I add Alice and Bob as contacts, they can both generate addresses for me on separate BIP32 nodes. Is it at all possible for Alice to determine the addresses that Bob can derive from his node?
@_date: 2014-09-17 04:28:14
Looks good! It would be nice if instead of specifying a fixed address in `payToAddress` you could provide an extended public key to a hierarchical deterministic wallet and every time you run `transferBalanceToMyAccount` it withdraws to a different address. This would improve privacy as customers wouldn't be able to examine the blockchain and see all of your other payments.

I've bought two from the Chadstone Hero. The first took around a minute to be detected after the CoinJar app claimed it was sent. I suspect this is CoinJar's fault as I have noticed they take a while to broadcast transactions sometimes.
During the second transaction the 4G internet was playing up on my phone and so the Pheeva iOS wallet just spun until I switched aeroplane mode on and off. It then went through instantly.
I am hoping that someone will come up with a POS system that only requires the merchant to be connected to the internet to avoid these sort of issues. This could be done by having the customer's wallet app sign the transaction and then send it to the POS device using bluetooth/peer-to-peer wifi. The POS would then validate it and broadcast it to the network.
@_date: 2014-07-17 05:39:03
Looks good. Breadwallet should be added to the mobile apps as it is the best wallet for iOS IMO. It's hierarchical deterministic, supports the payment protocol, is open source and is being rapidly improved by a responsive developer.
@_date: 2014-09-14 06:21:36
I consider breadwallet's simplicity a selling-point. :)
My favourite features of breadwallet are (1) all takes to back it up is writing down a BIP39 sequence of words and (2) it never re-uses bitcoin address. I've set a few people up with Mycelium and the initial backup is a pain. Once it is done I'm never sure if they have only backed up a single private key such that if they generated a new address they would have to create new backup. I expect this will change with the next release which will support a hierarchical deterministic wallet structure.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:49:17
Presumably Mt.Gox employees still have access to the private keys so what is done with the bitcoin is up to them at this stage. Ideally they will keep the bitcoins in an offline wallet until this whole mess is sorted out in court.
Hypothetically, if Mt.Gox lost the private keys those bitcoins would be lost forever. This reduction in the quantity of available bitcoins would cause the price to rise (assuming there was no change in demand due to perceptions of risk in holding bitcoins). So there would just be a reallocation of wealth from MtGox customers to everybody else who holds bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-06-21 09:47:03
The apps serve different purposes. Breadwallet is a perfect spending wallet where you don't want to be presented with too many options. bitWallet is for more hands-on transactions and for tracking offline wallet balances etc. The good thing is you don't need to pick one or the other - they have both earned a place on my home screen.
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:44:30
The countereffect is Gresham's law (bad money drives out good). When there are competing currencies people will be more inclined to spend the one that does not retain its value. So if somebody holds multiple currencies they will use the one that is most inflationary as currency. Meanwhile merchants will want to accept the currency that is known to be stable or increasing in value. The net effect is unknown since we have never had an economy with competing currencies and absent government mandated acceptance of a "legal tender".
@_date: 2014-08-10 14:27:14
You are probably thinking of the [WIF representation of a private key]( which includes information as to whether the derived public key should be compressed or not. The actual private key is just a 256 bit number that allows you to spend from outputs with either compressed or uncompressed public keys.
@_date: 2014-08-14 00:16:41

Correct. The d in bitcoind stands for daemon. This indicates it is a program that runs continuously in the background. The Core (Qt) Wallet and other wallets like Armory talk to the network via bitcoind.

My advice:
* Learn python; it is a perfect language for beginners. [Learn Python the Hard Way]( will get you up to speed quickly (don't be put off by the title). [Codecademy's course]( might also be helpful.
* Use [IPython Notebook]( It makes experimenting and prototyping so much easier and more enjoyable.
* Start a project that you are genuinely interested in - you will learn much faster if you are motivated. Don't fret if you feel like you don't have the technical ability yet, you will learn along the way.
* Run linux on your primary PC. Try to do as much as possible from the command line. It will be slow going at first but will make you much more productive long term. Ubuntu is a great OS for people new to linux.
* When you don't know how to do something, just google it. Expert developers haven't memorised every single class and method - they are just really proficient at googling.
Don't be deterred if you find low-level bitcoin code confusing. The protocol is designed to economise on data rather than be human-readable. If you want to program with bitcoin you are better off using a library like [pycoin]( [BitcoinJS]( [bitcore]( or [bitcoinj](

Cheers for the beer!
I highly recommend Homebrew. It is easy to set up as explained here:  Stick to either Homebrew *or* MacPorts though - using both can lead to conflicts.
If you install homebrew your pcre dependency error could be resolved with `brew install pcre`. You probably won't be able to run the executable on your cold storage machine unless you also install the required libraries on that machine. You could try building it on an offline linux machine as something like Debian may come with all the dependencies pre-installed. If not, there is no big security danger in taking a linux machine online once to install a few libraries through the built-in package manager. Just make sure it is offline when you generate your keys and remains offline thereafter.
If you use the WyseNynja's homebrew vanitygen it uses the latest OpenSSL and hence utilises multiple cores. You can also try building the OpenCL powered vanitygen by doing a `make oclvanitygen`. This runs significantly faster, even with OpenSSL 0.9 - in fact it seems just as fast as the homebrew oclvanitygen.

breadwallet can also sweep an address by scanning a QR code of it's private key from the "send money" screen.

[Coin Pocket]( is the easiest solution I've seen ([source code on GitHub]( It is a web app, so can't be blocked by Apple, and leverages a QR scanner app to make sending bitcoins easy. If you add it as a bookmark to the home screen it is pretty indistinguishable from a native app. One downside is there is currently no easy way to export your keys so you have to backup your iPhone and hope a restore will work as intended. So advise people not to store too much in there but as an introductory wallet it is pretty good.
The Pheeva wallet is really nice but a bit tricky to set up and I don't think they have their subscription model fully figured out.

It would be great if you could add a row indicating whether the wallet support the payment protocol ([BIP70]( This protocol allows the payment recipient to verify they are who they claim to be (so you can't be fooled by a MITM) and allows the wallet to provide a refund address to make refunds smoother.
You can tell whether an app supports the payment protocol by clicking the Donate Now button at [bitpay.com/demos]( and scanning the QR code. If it says you are paying to Bitpay and provides an invoice code then the app supports the payment protocol. If it just displays a regular bitcoin address then the app doesn't yet support BIP70.
This is what I have found:
* Blockchain: No
* Coin Pocket: No
* bitWallet: No
* GreenAddress: Yes
* Pheeva: No
* breadwallet: Yes

Those are just warnings and I get them as well when compiling against the system OpenSSL.

In normal economic conditions banks lend out deposits and stimulate the economy through fractional reserve banking. However in a recession banks may be too cautious to do this. So savings no longer imply investment and aggregate demand decreases (exacerbating the recession). The interest rate on deposits will fall but if people are excessively pessimistic this won't deter savings.
Thus Keynesians and Monetarists believe that during recessions the government should encourage consumption spending over saving by increasing the inflation rate.
Note that this is only an argument for inflation during recessions. In normal economic conditions Keynesians believe inflation is desirable to negate the effects of sticky wages.

CoinJar has always provided an excellent service to the Australian bitcoin community. It has VC backing and the cofounder, Asher Tan, is highly professional and trustworthy. I doubt *anybody* in the company would be able to steal bitcoins and definitely not without legal consequences. (Of course you shouldn't store significant amounts of bitcoin with *any* service where you don't control the keys.)
As for what happened at Bitcoinica, I have know idea if Ryan was involved with the theft (I know Amir Taaki accidentally published API keys on the web). But Ryan was like 17 at the time. Even if he is guilty, people can change and he has since contributed immensely to bitcoin in Australia so it is time to give it a rest with all the scammer allegations.

The Gliph app is totally open about supporting sending bitcoins from Coinbase, BIPS or Blockchain.info accounts. I don't think they have had any problem with Apple.
There is no local wallet app available but this may just be because no-one has submitted one. I can understand not wanting to invest the time into developing the app with the risk of it being rejected.
