And at what point does that just become normal usage?
@_date: 2016-08-25 15:00:53
Yes that is much better. Since as brighton38 has stated many times, eventually your systems will regress to not even needing blocks, since blocks are an aggregation of events over time across a massively distributed system. Something private blockchains do not need, and hence will no longer be a chain of blocks.

SegWit was required in order for the lightning network to function properly. The incentives lightning offers will get people moving to segwit post haste.

And what exactly are you thinking of?
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:12:10
But I thought segwit was a Trojan horse non-blocksize increase? How is it possible that there is that much data stamped in the network with only 1 block?
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:24:20
Yes I am using segwit addresses. Sending TO segwit addresses should not matter and if I pay the lowest fee it is sometimes many blocks before I get a confirmation.

This is a fucking great use of Bitcoin, even if steam doesn't hold any btc. There are probably so many kids that need to beg their parents to add their credit card to buy games for them. This will directly incentivize those groups who can't obtain credit cards to instead want bitcoins such that they can make permissionless purchase of games or items. 
I know for a fact my parents would have said no to a lot of shit on steam when I was younger and I would have been out trying to convert my allowance to bitcoin. Whether you agree with it or not, this is a form of censorship resistance.

How does a phone number give you access to 2fa? If you use gauth, they are not tied to phone number. If you use authy they are encrypted with a master password. How exactly does this attack work?
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:48:30
If Hal Finney was truly Satoshi, I am sure he would have left access of those coins to someone he loved. He had ample time since he knew he was a goner.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:44:03
One day, if the coins do not move, will become accessible by a computing brute force mechanism. As such attacks become more realistic (via quantum computers or some other similar concept) people will be required to move their coins to a more secure address scheme. 
If Satoshi does not move those coins, someone else will eventually gain control of them. Sort of like a pirate treasure hunt, old coins will eventually be dug up. 10 20 30 years out maybe, but it will happen. Depending on how the value of Bitcoin rises over that timespan, it could become a global government arms race to be the first to capture them. One day those coins WILL move... And we may actually have no clue who is responsible. Could even be North Korea.

How did you open the channel for free?
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:01:53
multiple channels open with the same coins, able to fund multiple routes in 1 tx.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:34:22
I see, didn't realize it would work like that. I was just thinking it would be cool if we could somehow fund multiple channels with 1 on chain tx and connect to multiple people, but I guess that's not feasible. Thanks for letting me know.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:23:26
Can you actually be certain of that? If for example coinbase starting batching, would you really be able to tell how many actual transactions were happening? A single transaction would actually include many payments to many people. 
Number of blockchain transactions is not a fair measurement of actual use, especially when Bitcoin is incentivizing efficient use of the chain...
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:45:50
Ability to commit an entire ENVIRONMENT into source control is incredibly powerful.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:17:26
Why is it so cheap to open a channel? Isn't it just a regular transaction? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:02:27
You can also tap the fee on  and enter a custom fee. I got confirmed relatively quickly yesterday using 200 sats
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:52:24
Regardless, one day, someone will gain access to those coins.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:08:54
They also let you pay a low fee and bump it up later if you so choose.
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:17:20
Do these numbers include batched transactions? Seems like this is an important metric people forget when they are comparing btc transactions vs other blockchains. 1tx could include 100 payments to all different people.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:09:15

Will it be possible to open multiple channels with multiple parties, using the same coins with some kind of a multisig/schnorr transaction?
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:14:22
I've been using it a long time. Their code is also posted to GitHub, if you wish to build it yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:47:26
It wouldn't really be feasible to create a time limit. Any such address update would be a soft fork, users would be able to move on their own and old addresses would continue working. In order to add a time limit we would have to completely disable old addresses, which would be a hard fork. Let's be frank, a hard fork on bitcoin is probably not gonna happen.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:52:29
No, the code is different. They changed the max block size parameter which breaks consensus and causes a hard fork. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:08:12
Any exchange that has been waiting for a GUI release shouldn't be an exchange.... Segwit has been working fine in 0.15 command line, I've implemented it myself in 30 minutes.

What are the reasons to use c-lightning over lnd?
@_date: 2019-07-06 15:59:36
Thanks. I'd just like to build a lightning app and having a hard time deciding which lib to use. I'm sure many others would have the same problem. Can loop in/out work with c-lightning? Seems like an important feature
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:17:29
How are they able to afford the transaction fees at this time? Lightning really should be a saving grace for these people, but for now it must make spending quite difficult?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:26:58
That is currently known as one of the huge security issues with Lightning... That's why I was curious how you had solved it:P
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:44:25
Nice try, coin creator
@_date: 2019-07-06 03:37:17
Isn't that because it has way more advanced features? What are the reasons to use this over lnd? I've noticed it's easier to get started with c-lightning, is that the only reason?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:25:50
Except they won't be able to send it to anyone due to the fees so this is a bit dishonest, no?
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:48:15
I take the mindset of appreciating my gains and happily being willing to spend some of it on things I want and need. The price could just as easily drop too.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:55:06
Wouldn't that require them to leave their computer on all the time?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:53:47
Exchanges would be a fabulous place to start. Traders could store their coins in a channel rather then having to store them on the exchange. This reduces the exchanges liabilities since the coins can't be hacked, and the user can have their coins ready for an instant trade without the risk of a counterparty losing their coins. Win win.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:27:17
What is your solution for an actor closing a channel with old state?

@_date: 2017-12-27 01:17:55
Layer two will be p2p and nodes will be competing based on their connections and  transaction fees they charge to route a tx. Sounds almost exactly the same to me.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:35:07
Let's not forget only 18 mil coins have been mined and studies show 40% of those coins are lost forever.
It also could mean that the value of Fiat is dropping more then the value of crypto is rising.

@_date: 2017-12-09 17:03:25
It's not a currency yet, we are investing in it's ability to get there one day. Once it gets there it will no longer be a good investment. Take the risk, reap the reward.

Why isn't Andreas invited to more high profile media interviews and shows... They keep having Roger ver on, calling him Bitcoin Jesus, and then letting him pump a scam, instead of having on the real Bitcoin Jesus, wtf!?

Ok, I've marked them.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:18:04
Really? I thought it was only the sending address that matters?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:34:35
Apparently a party can submit an older state to close the channel, a state in which they had more btc then they did in the newest state. Lightning does have some protection in that if a party did this, the other party could submit something that punishes them. However if that party is offline and unable to detect the invalid submission, the network would accept the old state as the final state, since it wouldn't know anything about the newer state. I believe there is some conversations about some actors being able to watch for invalid states on your behalf but I don't think that is fleshed out and has some obvious privacy concerns.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:21:11
What  I mean is, if the phone dies for example, the users funds suddenly become at risk...
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:57:58
In that case, are miners not a third party?

You appear to forget that the greatest profit maximizing technique is to ensure the value of the commodity they are producing goes up in value. The government stepping in and censoring would most definitely have the opposite effect.
@_date: 2015-12-04 18:30:27
So you are giving your coins away to a third party? That is no good, I wouldn't use this in it's current state. 
Perhaps green addresses model of a 2 of 2  wallet could be used? This would be a MUCH better way!
@_date: 2015-12-26 15:39:30
This eliminates that issue: 
@_date: 2015-12-04 19:50:36
I would hope that the financial incentive for mining this chain at virtually no extra cost would be enough to ensure near 100% of the mining power.
@_date: 2015-12-01 23:14:10
Lol, what a joker

Why does high profile media want to lead people to bcash?
@_date: 2015-12-29 21:06:34
Well they've clearly been working too slow, because the network needs an increase NOW. Perhaps allowing the flood gates to open will actually light a fire under their ass and get it done quicker. Perhaps miners will even begin chipping in on the development effort considering IBLT, subchains etc will allow them to mine more transaction fees. Humanity does a much better job when backed into a corner then not, there is no longer the leniency of time for these people.
@_date: 2015-12-30 13:36:18
Sorry but they haven't proven any flaws in his research, all I've seen is a bunch of hand waving bullshit that seems to miss many of the economic factors that bitcoin provides. When they can show some actual math and studies proving what they say then maybe I could believe them, until then nothing I've seen refuting his work is anything more then conjecture.
Gavin put it quite sufficiently:
"I think most developers "can't see the forest because they're down in the trees" -- there is, and will continue to be (if not limited by arbitrary protocol limits) innovation happening at every level in the ecosystem.
Some developers believe that all innovations to solve scaling or centralization problems must be invented by them or must be implemented before allowing growth. Show me another thriving system with that attitude and I'll reconsider my belief that the best path to success is to let smart people innovate."
@_date: 2015-12-04 23:12:20
I understand that, but if you used a 2 of 2 system similar to how green address does it, you would be able to guarantee 0 confirmation transactions at the actual time the user makes the transaction. This would allow for the user to hold Btc and only sell the exact amount they need on a per transaction basis, while at the same time protecting the users Btc from any third party control.
@_date: 2015-12-05 21:36:21
Is there any way to point mycellium at your own full node like with bitcoin wallet for android?
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:39:56
Again, only if they are online. It's still a risk that would be hard to explain to the average user. Of course using this entities like exchanges would be great since they wouldn't have to hold your money, it's still better then today trusting them with your entire deposit, you'd only have to trust them with open orders.
@_date: 2015-06-24 14:18:35
Why do you think tens of thousands of business around the globe would not be "wide spread"? And if any attack like that were to occur the network would respond by placing up far more nodes in protest. The internet is good at this reaction.
If someone were to "crush" bitcoin at this time the whole world would know who they are and they would have to answer to the throw back. The vulrability would be addressed and the system would reboot with everyone's balance in tact.
@_date: 2015-12-03 20:05:02
Well with the release of "Bitcoin Unlimited" quick approaching, that burden of proof is soon to be provided. We shall see.
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:55:49
Sounds to me like the blocksize getting bigger, and causing some centralization, actually caused developers to get off their asses and develop solutions to the centralization problem, allowing bitcoin grow.  Now instead we want to prevent it from growing in order the avoid that panic that creates new and innovative solutions, which gets us nowhere.
@_date: 2015-12-04 16:12:23
how is this going to work with 0 confirmations? or does Plutus have to hold your money?

What needed correcting exactly? Maybe he doesn't want to "correct it" because its not wrong.
So what if it's been discussed for a while? He actually put the work into an actual academic paper, widened the audience and got people understanding/interested. Why does this upset people so much?
I'm sorry that Maxwell likes to hide out in his clubhouse making people feel excluded and stupid for trying to participate while Peter R tries to foster an open discussion with transparency, openness and kindness, and now it turns out that Maxwells model is not doing so well.

Uber will be just fine as long as they keep doing a good job. Once they become complacent, and turn into a large dickish corperation, and start screwing people over, push back will begin. Of course they will already be so engrained in society that they would need to make multiple grave injustices before people stand up enough to topple it with some kind of decentralized protocol.

Oxygen most certainly does have a market! Too much life and not enough oxygen would lead to death. That's about as clear cut of a market as a you can get. Luckily we have more then enough oxygen for everyone so this doesn't matter, but you can bet your ass that if the population grew to a point that oxygen became thin, a price market would form VERY quickly.... Or we'd grow more trees and increase supply!
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:36:02
I've wondered about this too, but at some point the proof of work due to the increased fees should be great enough that no single entity would be able to attack the network, regardless of how much value was hosted on the btc network. A point of diminishing returns so to speak.
@_date: 2015-12-03 14:00:41
You feeling that something is highly unlikely is not the same thing as "will not work", but nice headline.
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:48:16

"Only the Catholic Church was founded by God Himself and has the means of which men can become holy. For example, non-Catholics cannot have their sins forgiven because they do not seek to confess their sins to a valid Catholic priest with authority to forgive sins in God's name.
Furthermore, other religions and belief systems, in their dissent from Catholicism, are necessarily evil in nature, and as such lead to Hell.
At the same time, everyone who goes to Hell does so by their own free choice."

These business would likely also be enthusiasts who wouldn't hesitate to run a separate full node as a "personal" entity if that happened. But if you think that globally all businesses can have their full node "regulated" then at home users aren't going to have much of an easier time either. Their activities full be fully detectable by isp's.

10 minutes also leads to a lot of larger variance. I've seen 1 hour blocks quite a few times now. I think those would dissappear 1 minute targeted blocks.

Is it normal that every time my computer shuts down unexpectadly that I have to reindex the entire blockchain over again. This has taken me so many days to get everything indexed.

This is like the third time it has gotten somehow corrupted now.
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:36:15
Except if blocks actually filled to 20mb that would mean that bitcoin was getting 2000% more usage. In that world I would bet there are many more businesses operating on the blockchain and more people that can afford to or need full nodes would also increase. Maybe you won't be able to run it on your home connection, so what? Home nodes are unreliable and unstable anyway. We need a solid fast backbone run by serious operations. This world is still very decentralized.

I have seen some mining factories yes. But no, I have not seen any direct evidence of how much of each pools hashrate is owned by themselves. 
I'm not so sure economies of scale hold up in the long run... Massive building space, heat dissipation requirements, liquid cooling systems, on call staff all are things not required by say, individuals running a 21 computer chip. Mining is pretty close to being commoditized as well. 
Also the recent news about some governments considering some bitcoin holdings... Why wouldn't these governments also consider doing some mining to protect their investment from other countries, and then others will follow. None will want their own transactions censored by other governments and let's face it, they will never be able to come to an agreement on such things anyway. The network will continue on as a neutral global protocol while the Nash equilibrium keeps things in check.

"Bitcoin gives you a bunch of capabilities revolving around decentralized trust that many organizations don't care about. If you strip away the tech related to protecting a peer to peer network from other participants you don't trust, the entire technology becomes *useless*."
The blockchain is an absolutely horrible design for anything other then trustless decentralized p2p value transfer. It is slower, more expensive, and more inefficient then just about any alternative out there if you chop off those qualities.
@_date: 2015-12-03 17:25:29
Right, all it would take is one scientist to find one of these chips, or pick up on the network communications, then they could write a tool that people could run to detect it. If it was then detected on mass there would be a crazy amount of blowback(I'd like to think anyway).
@_date: 2015-06-01 14:41:42

False. PayPal is a single company in a single country. Bitcoin run by thousands of differant businesses across different jurisdictions around the world is equally as decentralized as people running nodes at home. Except nodes at home are more unreliable and on shittier connections. There also comes a point when too many nodes really adds nothing of value. Regardless the enthusiasts will still exist as well.

@_date: 2015-12-29 19:39:28
It's not meant for extra security, it's meant for increasing tx propagation times, leading to less orphans, leading to the network being able to safely handle more txs. Which in effect, actually does create extra security when less hash power is going to orphans and higher tx rate = higher price = more miners.
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:51:33

I think the network is more then capable of protecting your consulting business. I think this would come into play far more with larger players, such as nasdaq deciding to settle stock on the blockchain. I'm sure they would be doing very intense analysis on whether or not they believe the network could secure their transactions. If they believe that it cannot, then they will not use it.
@_date: 2015-12-03 18:32:35
So let's say they do indeed centralize around a smaller number of pools. They are just pools, not miners. If at any time one of those pools are attacked, censored, or do something the actual hashers do not like, they will simply redirect their hashpower elsewhere. Hell, this would work even if there was one giant pool. The second any government or anyone stepped up to force that pool to do something, it would immediately split into separate instances and everyone would redirect their power. In practice, this one pool will never happen, because people have so many different perspectives and ideologies on how things should be done, that this leaves room for different pools with different ideologies, to amass different hashers who are truly voting with their hashpower. If at any time that pool goes against the will of it's hashers, another pool will spring up to happily siphon those hashers away. I believe we will see an example of the "ideological" pooling when slush re-enables bip 101 and effectively "steals" hashpower from other pools. 
Hashers will always tend towards enforcing the rules that they believe will raise the value of the resource they mine, nothing more.

No. And nothing is going to happen until it's obvious that the majority of the network will accept the change. Running xt now is nothing more then a vote and nobody is going to push any larger blocks until they know it would be accepted. All this doomsday crap is bullshit because nobody is going to be stupid enough to just split the network in two. It's not going to happen. All this is doing is preparing for when the network gets saturated, the network will have the option to start pushing bigger blocks. When backs are against the wall, people will very quickly be able to come to a consensus. Before that NO ONE IS GOING TO PARTAKE IN A CHANGE THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY DESTROY EVERYONES MONEY.

I could also say that if what you say is true, then there will be the reverse effect of less people willing to put assets on the network, given the disproportionately stronger the incentive to attack the network. This would lead to a free market equilibrium of people only trusting the network with assets it believes it is capable of protecting.

The only thing preventing me from using this is having to use a custom wallet. I had a similar idea to building a company using features like this and this was my number one blocker. This kind of functionality needs to be able to work with blockchain.info or another wallet of my choice. I should be able to import one key into blockchain and have it be able to call out to a third party service such as yours when sending btc. I assume this would require a partnership with blockchain... I see it more likely for blockchain to implement this themselves and easily wipe out any competing company, unfortunately:( 
A better solution would be some sort of open standard integrated into all wallets that allow a user to plug in a third party service of their choice.

I'm not so sure this would have been a bad thing. The only thing this patch would change was any withdrawals from the bter account *alone*. Given that such a change would only be done by community consensus, not a few developers deciding so, and that no other account balances would be changed... Well, I'm torn.
This is still a new system, only a few months old and it should have some breathing room to find it's footing, much like bitcoin had to do in it's early days of duplicated coins and hard forks. It's very clear that the longer a system goes and the more users the more impossible changes like this become. Even being such early days it has become clear that forming consensus on this is already almost impossible.

It seems like VoS is more interested in moving quickly then moving carefully. Virtex has known for a long time that expanding to the US is a giant no no. Also VoS's quickness in adding gimmicks like Doge and their focus on, "Next stop, the world!!!" worries me that they are putting their customers funds at more risk then required and biting off more then they can chew in an uncertain regulatory environment. Doge is not proven, does not have the hash power bitcoin does and open possible holes that could open them up to exploits. Virtex has stated that right now their saving grace has been that they are NOT expanding world wide as that opens them up to all kinds of shit storms. I agree that VoS's support is currently better but they are also not handling the type of volume virtex is and I am not sure we would see the same level if they were to have to scale up and go through all the shit Virtex has on their way to the top. Virtex has been down all these roads before and they've chosen their path very carefully, and VoS just seems like too much of a cowboy. 
Given all the shit lately I feel more comfortable keeping large sums of money with Virtex instead.

Think of it this way. 2 of 3 multisig.
User hold 2 keys, server holds 1 key.
(One of users keys should be placed in a very secure place. Hopefully to never be used.)
User signs a transaction for 10 btc and passes signed transaction to the server. Server sees that the user has stated a 5 btc per day limit. Server doesn't sign and transaction doesn't go through. If transaction was for &lt; 5 then server would sign and broadcast the transaction. Many other rules could be created such as &gt; 5 but &lt; 10 require a 2 factor code. if &gt; 10 then a personal phone verification must take place. Who knows, people can be creative.
Server can't steal coins or get "hacked" since it only has one key. If server was to shut down, user can still pull out their backup key and move the funds to a new address. 
This has to be the holy grails of bitcoin wallets as it would make me feel a billion times safer hosting my coins in an online wallet.

Actually as I said I currently am sitting on a return of 100% for a few months investment. This is a brand new company that has begun increasing it's dividend every month and this month just acquired two other large bitcoin gambling sites. I expect to see the dividend increase dramatically. There's a reason why the share price is where it is and it's much like speculation on the current bitcoin price: future growth. Have you ever invested in a startup before? They obviously don't pay huge dividends out of the gate but their potential increase in price can be very large if they succeed, which Cbtc most definitely looks to be doing. Watch out for their financial report coming out today.

I didn't lose anything. But I'm not sure that somebody holding 5% of the money supply and destroying the lives of so many users is actually good for the currency. Crypto is based on consensus... As long as consensus is formed the currency is doing exactly what it is supposed to be doing.
At the same time I see the other side of the fence and again... I'm completely torn.

Supernet is being put together by one of the most respected and talented devs I have seen, jl777. Currently a powerhouse dev on third party nxt applications such as the multigateway.org and lead dev on bitcoin dark (btcd) with the new groundbreaking teleport technology. here is the prospectus pdf:  this is definitely something to watch. 
James: "If I wanted to maximize my personal wealth, I would have made fancy slides and presentations, held meetups, go to conferences. I am not money motivated. I have given away millions of dollars of crypto to further the cause. Money to me is like a data structure. It is there, it is useful, but I certainly wouldn‘t be changing my philosophy to get more data structures. If I need more money I just make more, so it is no problem for me that consumes time. I am not doing what I do for maximizing the amount of MY money. I am doing my best to increase the value of my assets and BTCD and NXT as this is my duty to the investors. I am operating on longer time frames than most crypto people. My vision is to have as many people make as much money as possible via crypto so that a brain drain from fiat is started. Probably not started this with one week that included the primary host backing out. So, follow the money see how much I am making and compare that to how much the investors are making. Maybe I make 5% by having purchased it with my cryptowealth, maybe more, maybe less. This means 95% of the money is being made by others. This is what I aim for."

One of the strongest solutions to this incompetence would be that the authority in cyberspace create a completely new currency for digital cash. I will tentatively call this new currency's unit "netty." Netty would be a new currency similar to the dollar or yen. Only the monetary authority could issue netty-term digital cash, and other banks on the Internet use this cash as a base money and issue their bank's digital cash. Consequently, cyberspace could obtain sovereignty as far as currency is concerned. Cyberspace could obtain monetary independence with respect to money [7].
To some readers, this scenario may sound like science fiction. I would like to stress again that this is not a prediction, but a possible and probably a most radical scenario, rooted in the basic characteristic of digital cash.

First comment is exactly what I was thinking the whole time I was reading this:
"If, and this is a big if, the person who is receiving the bitcoin has no need to convert to fiat, then, in fact, it does work exactly as the advertisement states. Case in point, a couple of weeks ago my daughter was in Copenhagen Denmark and found a restaurant which accepted bitcoin. I was able to pay for her meal, halfway around the world, in a moment and, of course with essentially no fee; something that would be impossible via any other means.
Every single day more and more vendors are accepting bitcoin and, as this trend continues, there will be less need for people to convert to national fiat.
We are on a long trek path of gaining general world-wide acceptance of bitcoin. Every day you can do more and more with bitcoin alone, with no need to convert to fiat. In those instances where the recipient does not need to convert to fiat then, indeed, bitcoin works exactly as advertised in the mockumentary ad."

No it is not. That pdf does not in any way prove that the system cannot work for its intended purpose - which is not to compete with bitcoin as money.

See point 4.1.2:
"In a “history attack”, someone acquires a large number of tokens, sells them, and then attempts to 
create a successful fork from just before the time when their tokens were sold or traded. If the 
attack fails, the attempt costs nothing because the tokens have already been sold or traded; if the 
attack succeeds, the attacker gets their tokens back. Extreme forms of this attack involve 
obtaining the private keys from old accounts and using them to build a successful chain right 
from the genesis block. 
 
In Nxt, the basic history attack generally fails because all stake must be stationary for 1440 blocks 
before it can be used for forging; moreover, the effective balance of the account that generates 
each block is verified as part of block validation. The extreme form of this attack fails because the 
Nxt blockchain cannot be re-organized more than 720 blocks behind the current block height."
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:48:59
They've now integrated miicard.com verification which should help that situation immensely! If you tried to verify during a crazy rally when all exchanges are overloaded due to an unexpected rise and lack of staff then it's what you should expect. I got verified early to be ready for such an event and I had a great time easily depositing money frequently that was credited to my account in 2-3 days.
@_date: 2014-11-25 00:07:40
False. What you need to realize is that supernet is not only nxt, it is adding new features to every coin and therefore it is making bitcoin more powerful.

Individuals don't have a need for more and more powerful PC's when all they need is to check facebook and type word documents. They also want to have their own computers and not rely on internet connectivity to use it so I don't think that example really works. 
If people can benefit from a larger investment in cooling, electricity &amp; space then it makes sense that economies of scale would take over... I'm certainly no expert though, just speaking from my gut.

Well the beauty of Bcash is that it shares the same hashing algorithm and Bitcoin with only &lt; 20% of the value/hashrate. It's over 5 times easier to 51% bcash so if an attack is gonna happen it would make so much more sense to hit that first.

Virtex is the only exchange that has both high volume and deals in CAD. Honestly the problems I've had are far outweighed by the benefits and the 1.5% fee is nothing on the gains we expect to make from BTC. Sure, it's not a frequent trader platform, but either is VoS with its volume and generally higher prices. Virtex is a great way to get you in (relatively) quickly, buy your btc(usually at better then average prices anyway) , then send it to some other platform like btce or bitfinex if you need to do frequent trading.

I can vouch for virtex too. Been with them since 2011 and while they had some issues over that time I attribute it to the growing pains of a very fast growing company. Trying to keep up with bitcoin is no easy task and I think they've done a great job. Keeping your money in a Canadian schedule 1 bank with no international risk is their motto. They've even hired the previous mayor of Ottawa for their task of convincing regulators that bitcoin is a good thing to embrace and I applaud Joseph for his efforts here.

The fact that companies are expecting to make money off of you forgetting, while not necessarily illegal, should not be a business model. I would rather not have to sign or read such a contract and simply push the money when I've decided I would still like the service. Offer me a discount if you wish for me to pay for a full year.

I've seem a number of pump and dumps in crypto. You clearly don't understand what that means because Nxt does not fit the bill. Constantly producing actual ground breaking innovation like the freemarket, mgw and supernet is not what a pump and dump consists of. If you want to see a pump and dump research blocknet, a poor copy of supernet.

Thanks for the info. Just one more question: how can we be certain that the keys are generated securely and that your service won't one day attempt to store a second key. Obviously not saying you'll do that but I'm sure you know how these things work and that it is something to be aware of. Is all your wallet code from scratch? Have you implemented your own address generator? Using unproven wallet code/address generation also makes me nervous.

No, the federal reserve and BIS are not working beautifully.
Yes, they are creating a distributed consensus. How long will they need to run before people accept that?
I am more so referring to them being a platform, rather then a currency. Bitcoin does currency well and I expect none of them will replace it in that respect but other systems have different needs for different features and PoS is a valid way for them to function.
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:58:02
No, the coins produced would be the same. Just the method of determining who gets to create the next block would be changed slightly.

Virtex's company goals have always been to take a proactive stance towards bitcoin regulation and taxation. So while theoretically they don't have to pay GST I believe that they are in order to stay on the good side of the canadian government. Part of those fees also goes towards paying lawyers to help pave the way on regulation &amp; education of bitcoin in Canada.
With all of this they are still having a very hard time pleasing the banks and this is why I believe no other exchanges are actually working with Canada using CAD. The fact that virtex has been able to so far successfully navigate these waters where others has failed says a lot I think.
@_date: 2014-05-21 03:38:09
That makes absolutely no sense. They are one of the oldest exchanges in the world, and was the only exchange in Canada for a very long time. I do not see how that would be anything close to a feasible business model, or even neccasary. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 18:41:21
No, Nxt is not vulnerable to it. Please research again. I believe Nxt implements a PoW scheme that affects someone trying to stake grid exponentially. Also the blockchain cannot be reorged more then 720 blocks.
You haven't provided any kind of prove that nxt is susceptible to this kind of attack. We have an academic research project ongoing that will hopefully prove all this out. We'll just have to wait.

I don't understand why they wouldn't just issue gift cards or write an app that issues digital numbers from their own private database. What do they need bitcoin for? no idea what this thread is on about...
Not to mention, waiting to release this on something like ethereum would make far more sense since it allows for easy creation of such tokens that are independent from bitcoins value.

It's called an exchange.
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:29:13
I think a big part of the reason is the fact that bitcoin is so undervalued right now. There is no way I'm letting any of mine go at this price. I'm sure you'll see more business once the price starts to rise again.

I've been wondering when Tor would implement this. Also StorJ will allow the storing and retrieval of any file in a similar fashion. Decentralized file retrieval will open up a whole new swath of applications as webpages get accessed from such a system, use bitcoin 2.0 blockchains as their database and communication layer. That and streaming pirated movies is about to get a whole lot easier.

He actually says, surprisingly enough, that it could be implemented as a soft fork! Although of course it would still not be easy to implement, it requires more research, implementation and testing, as well as getting a lot of people on board. But the fact is that there are problems with the current protocol and we need to begin working on their solutions asap, waiting for a disaster is a horrible way protect our new digital economy.

Havelock also audits all their listing and only releases the money as each company proves why they need it for business operations. Coloured coin stocks will likely be filled with tons of scams or dishonest companies that either skim profit off their results or dissappear with your money all together. I very much appreciate the service Havelock is able to provide their users and it would be a huge shame to see them shut down.

@_date: 2014-06-13 13:03:41
Isn't your tree chains a solution to a lot of these problems... Is there any progress being made there? It seems like they would be a requirement for solving all sorts of things such as miners working on smaller pieces and still getting paid, not having to store the whole blockchain and therefore requiring less hard drive space per node, solving blockchain bloat... etc.

No, it should be extremely complimentary to Bitcoin. They are also working very closely with the Ethereum team. 
Basically they are a platform that can enable trading of any instrument, including bitcoin. They've created a trustless model that still allows for the use of servers which means they can complete trades much faster and more cheaply. Something like 10000x faster and cheaper then a blockchain. It basically fills the gap in areas where blockchains are weak, while still not having to trust anyone with your coins. A true way of doing off blockchain transactions safely.
This should even be able to replace our current need to trust people like exchanges with our money, while still allowing for high frequency trading on an exchanges platform.
The bigger story however is what them and the Ethereum team are doing in Switzerland which I'll let you watch the video when it is posted to learn about that:)

So it does seem a bit better but it still feels overall clumsy to use.
 - Log in still takes a long time to get to home screen
 - There is no responsiveness to touching the top left menu button. There is no feedback that it's been touched and sometimes either it takes too long to load or the touch simply isn't registered, but many times I'm left wondering if I actually hit the button or not, or am I just waiting for a long load time? Leads me to waiting a while, see the screen not changing and then having to press it again. Happens all the time it feels like.
 - No feedback when I click a menu item either. Nothing happens and I just have to wait and see if I actually pressed a menu item properly.
 - Some screen randomly show the spinning loading circle, then it goes away then it comes back again. Seems to do this after my screen turns off and on too... It shows the spinner, then it goes away, then it shows it again. In between there I try to push buttons and nothing responds. not even sure what it's refreshing. I hate full blocking screen loaders... put a loader only over the data that is actually refreshing and allow me to interact with other pieces of the app if I so wish. Ie. the menu button, since all I really want is to go to another screen.
 - It's too difficult to use my app to send a quick payment. With blockchain, I simply enter my pin and then click the send button on the top right. WIth your app it's: select pin box, enter pin, hit enter, hit enter again, wait forever, stare it spinner show and hide and show, hit menu button (miss menu button?),hit send money.
 - if I'm in Send Money and I click on the QR code, then I hit back... It takes me back to the Balance screen?

What are your thoughts on Peter Todd's tree chains?

ya well those are up to interpretation as to whether or not they are even problems.

This would not only solve blockchain bloat by "decentralizing" pieces of the blockchain across the internet so that every node doesn't need the whole thing - only the branch they are working on, but it also solves the variance problem and therefore eliminating the need for pools.

MaidSafe looks like an awesome technology that in the end really has very little to do with MSC. Not sure why I would want to stay away from this groundbreaking tech just because of the way they are issuing the initial tokens.

Not at the moment. It's not perfect but it sure beats having to trust a single point of failure, an exchange who generally charges a rather large % based fee for the pleasure! When more bitcoin miners start processing higher then 2 of 3 the multigateway can begin to scale out even further. Its a first step and it is definitely better then what we have and will only get better.

I'm not sure OT fits in the same grouping as those systems. It isn't even really a "contract" system. It is FAR more then that. It is not a blockchain, it stitches blockchains together and gives them access to the advantages of a server for when they need it. The blockchain has many disadvantages over something running on a server: speed, cost, efficiency to name a few. OT will be the yang to bitcoins ying, while also solving the problem of trusted third parties. I'd love to see these messages that make you think he was specifically calling out OT.

Just like last time there was a serious problem with the network (hard fork) this is simply a test for Bitcoin and the community. Seeing how well everyone came together to solve the issue was a very interesting experiment that in the end, had the effect of actually raising the price after all was said and done. It gave the community more confidence that Bitcoin can take whatever comes it's way. This is just another test of what will probably be many and each time Bitcoin passes it becomes stronger. HODL!

Is ripple truly decentralized? Could you please point me to a description of how it works and why it is able to pull of such quick confirmations where others have failed? I understand how btc works and how nxt works which makes me even more puzzled about how ripple could pull it off without having centralized points and no mining. Although nxt is supposed to be getting instant confirmations soon, if ripples tech is truly so revolutionary while still remaining completely decentralized then I really wonder how it has not taken off after all this time.

It was created on a computer that hasn't touched the internet. It would only ever scanned using a trusted app open source app on a non rooted phone. Sure anything is possible but unless I was being directly attacked by someone powerful this is more then good enough. If I made it multisig then what would I do with the second key? It's still mine, still technically a single point of failure.
I also don't actually use paper at all, a digital pdf is good enough for me.

The point of these videos and other things on the internet is to start some sort of viral campaign that gets Apple to react and to show people that there is another option out there apart from their current dictatorship.

I think you may have a misunderstanding about how Nxt works. Nxt uses a proof of stake algorithm, not hashes. Distribution of forging[mining] power has gotten quite decentralized as time has gone on. Nxt is nowhere near easy to attack. Keep in mind, Nxt is a platform and it's not meant to be a "coin". It is a crypto platform for doing things exactly as you are trying here, designing distributed apps. Bitcoin's job is to act as money, two very different problems. Your goal for something like this should be to use the best tool for the job, and shoehorning it into bitcoin when their are better options out there isn't right.
Please take a look at the telepathy whitepaper to see the new groundbreaking anonymity tech being built into supernet(built on top of nxt). Perfect for firing all kinds of messages and communications without exposing any ips)

To repost what I placed in Virtex has been getting a lot of hate lately but some people need to remember that Virtex has been solely responsible for pioneering bitcoin in Canada. They worked through all the early day bullshit of trying to find and work with banks, getting shut down left and right, thwarting criminal threats to employees and their families, working to stay proactive and working closely with lawyers to help foster positive relationships and education with regulators... the list goes on and on.
These new exchanges have now been able to come in and ride on the coat tails of Virtex's hard (and expensive) work paving the way and are now getting the easy treatment. Don't get me wrong, strong competition is only going to be a good thing for Canadians but we need remember that Virtex has done an unbelievably amount along the years getting bitcoin in Canada to where it is today, provided a safe place for Canadian to store their funds to avoiding a goxing or wiring their money into and out Slovenia, and I believe that they should be commended for relentless hard work, against many odds.
That said there are quite a few things that you guys really need to work on going forward:
Communication: Your communication thus far has been sub par. When issues happen with your site support takes too long to reply, when users post here with criticism or issues you guys are nowhere to be found. Your reputation has taken a massive hit because of this.(looks like this is finally changing). In the past you would do things like remove payment options or shut down functionality, or add higher fees to other functionality without any clear reasons as to why. No idea why bill payments moved to $20 - you said it was regulations yet vos continues to do bill payments cheaper. Considering this is the fastest way to get money on your site, this is very disappointing.
Slow moving: You guys move SLOW. I have referred so many users to you guys and they have all come back to me with this exact complaint. The company just does not feel agile and efficient. Just about everything you've ever promised has either come very late(shares, ltc) or not at all(Shorting). Support feels like it takes longer then it should to get back to you. You have so many employees yet we rarely see any updates that help the user, until recently most updates have actually been the removal of functionality.
Your website and lack of attention to details: Seriously it would take all of 5 minutes to implement a "withdraw all" button on your website that makes it so I don't have to manually calculate -0.0005 every time I withdraw. The site is just littered with these kinds of inefficiencies that boggles my mind that they haven't been fixed. Can't wait to see the updated website, I really hope you've paid attention to this sort of thing.
Implement interac online ASAP!!!!!!
All in all I appreciate all the work you guys have done and I'm really glad to see this fire being lit under your ass from VoS. It can only be good for Canadians long term.

I have one question about security with this app. One of the key features of this wallet is security with multisig and requiring a 2 factor code to send btc.

Cool idea but I can't seem to figure out how it prevents someone from just withdrawing all your coins once they gain access to your BitGo account. I don't see anywhere to place any kind of limits or transaction rules.

See my post below for an overview of what was discussed after Vitalik posted his Stake article. Basically we have learned that NXT uses a form of TaPOS and is not susceptible to the "nothing at stake" issue or a history attack. It also has many of Vitalik's other suggestions  to make it even more secure already in development. He didn't know this when he wrote the article but after a discussion with the developers he admitted NXT is doing a much better job then he thought.
I've only recently been having my aha moment for NXT after being very skepticle... They are on to something over there and to ignore it would be to bury your head in the sand much like most of the population did towards bitcoin. Do your own research.

Currently the coins are held in a 2 of 3 multisig voting pool. The three servers are run by three separate trusted and well known entities(who have an incentive in seeing the system succeed). While this solution isn't perfect, it is better then trusting your coins with a single point of failure(an exchange) who also charges you rather large fees for the pleasure. Trade fees are 1 nxt, less then 2 cents at the moment. Withdrawal fees are 0.0001 btc. No crappy % based fees. Also, these 3 server do not need to have their ips exposed the internet. Nobody knows where they even are which makes hacking that much more difficult.
Again this is not perfect, but it is better then what we have. Currently the 2 of 3 is a limitation of the bitcoin network not forwarding higher sig transactions. Over time this limitation will be lifted and we can add more and more servers to the voting pool to make it even more secure. This is a step in the right direction.
I particularly like that I can directly buy btc instantly with my nxt without ever having to leave my client or send anything to an exchange. Buy btc, withdraw to btc wallet instantly. Very convenient.
Low volume right now but it saw pretty high volume during the beta phase so it's only a matter of time before people move over.

What are your thoughts on mining centralization and do you have any possible solutions. I feel that economies of scale will produce ever larger mining operations that will eventually be easy regulation targets. Do you ever see Bitcoin implemented a hybrid proof of stake model to combat this?

Multisig is better for a company where you don't want one person with control of the funds, or for you every day spending money via something like greenaddress.it. The bulk of my coins are on a single key wallet I generated offline and printed onto a bip32 paper wallet with a long password stored only in my head. There is no reason multisig is more secure then that.
@_date: 2014-09-03 12:55:40
The thing is, the password requires a scrypt algorithm to decrypt and takes a long to time to even try one password. A weak human readable password is actually pretty sufficient. To be extra safe throw an special character on the end.

Why does every node on the network all have to do the exact same duplicated effort? Why isn't there a way to split up the work so that a "smaller" node could only handle 10% of txs, or 1% of the blockchain? Then combining all the nodes across the whole network would be the same that we have now, only you can choose how much your node is able to contribute. The fact that every single node all has to do 100% of the exact same thing every other node is doing seems a little wasteful. I thought tree chains was going to allow for differant nodes to work on differant pieces of the blockchain, what ever happened to that?

Dude don't you have have more important things to do, like working on improving Bitcoin?
51% of stake is not even close to belonging to such a small amount of people. All those initial stakers have spent much of their nxt on hiring developers to implement features in the system and have been distributed much more then that. Could it be better? Sure. But it is nowhere near the threat you are making it out to be.

It's important to them because they CHOSE to make it important to them.

This comment doesn't make a lot of sense. For one, the market did react as the price did drop substantially. We then recovered as many people such as myself realized that gox is not bitcoin, this is in no way the death of bitcoin, and decided that this was the perfect buying opportunity.

Right now it isn't as bad, but quoted at 386 even though I see a $2544.63 buy order on virtex @ 390. Not sure why they quote you before even knowing how much you wish to spend.

They should really just create a token on top on counterparty that offers people $1 per token with participating merchants, create a nice wallet that abstracts bitcoin away and offers points and discounts for using the system. Gets rid of volatility for customer and the wallet can use the merchant api to pass the network fees to the merchant, which would require them to keep small stashes on Btc on hand. You'd be able to load your wallet instantly via bitcoin and partnerships with other payment methods to preload your wallet. I'm betting currenc will eventually fail and be replaced by such a system.

Of course not but if we're going to reach any kind of mass adoption we can't be charging such ridiculous fees.  Why is it always percentage based? One transaction is one transaction, it shouldn't cost so much more just because the number is higher. And with a lot of transactions 0.001 adds up.

As long as users can continue sending transactions flawlessly, we could switch the mining alogrithm whenever someone gets close. Sure it would suck hard for all the miners that invested in hardware... but who cares? Too bad for them. As long as there is value to be mined other miners with other hardware will pick it up where the others left off and the network will continue to operate. Some butthurt miners or not, the network will continue to chug along just fine as the honey badger just doesn't give a fuck.

I believe that decision can be made based on which fork has the most transactions happening on it. Look, I'm still new to this too, my main stake is still with Bitcoin, in fact I believe they can both coexist. I am just seeing some very elegant solutions being worked on by Nxt and people simply ignoring it because "pos" is just silly. There is clearly a problem with Bitcoin today... Microtransactions are not feasible as fees are rising, the ghash and environmental issues of mining are no small problem and confirmation times are slow, we need coins like NXT to spearhead research in ways to do things differently and more smart. Experimentation and research are supposed to be a good thing. Don't just stick your head in the sand and ignore other possibilities just because you have a stake in Bitcoin. Again, so do I, but I am most certainly going to keep my eyes peeled for better solutions so I can avoid being surprised from left field if something else does come along. Right now NXT is closer then anything else in crypto to being that thing and ignoring that fact gets me nowhere.
and I'm sorry, but shit like this is just *powerful*

Up next will be InstantDex. It will allow instant trading between any coin or asset pair using dynamic orderbooks stored in a DHT cloud(like storj) for a extremely small fee. It will also support the ability to program your own trade bots, and allow for people to subscribe to other people's open source bots and share in the profits - without having to trust their funds with a centralized party. The days of trading on centralized exchanges are quickly coming to an end.

What is the big deal? There will be many choices, if one doesn't route things the way you like you don't have to use them. At the end of the day either your transactions get settled on the blockchain as you wish them to be or they don't. If not then you use another of the multitude of services.

My investment is in no way entrusted to them, nor do their qualifications matter. The code to allow users and miners to raise the blocksize without permission from core has been written. It is publicly auditable and works as intended. That is the only thing that matters to me. This code doesn't give the developers any super powers, any extra power over the network nor does it mean we will be forced to take code from them in the future. 
The network now has two paths forward and one will be selected. The other group will be forced to follow and the network will carry on as it always has.

Yes, I had been very skeptical for quite some time but I bought a small amount "just in case". Just like with bitcoin it takes some time for things to sink in and lately I have become extremely impressed with the work they are doing that I have significantly increased my stake. Instant Confirmations and the multigateway exchange(nxt to any other altcoin p2p) are two huge features I am looking forward to but many exciting things on the way: 
It may also be the answer to micro transactions since nxt's network costs significantly less to operate then Bitcoin's.

*Another though I'd love to here your opinion on*: I've always wondered if it would be possible to have some sort of a scale where say 20% of blocks were produced by full nodes mining with proof of stake and 80% of blocks are produced by proof of work. Not only would it incentivize full nodes but this scale could also be slid around via consensus depending on if someone is reaching too much hash power. If someone reaches 51% we could slide the scale another 10% for a 30/70 PoS/PoW mining system which would effectively take some power away from the attacker quickly since they'd be unlikely to have all that mining power AND a ton of stake.

Just like last time there was a serious problem with the network (hard fork) this is simply a test for Bitcoin and the community. Seeing how well everyone came together to solve the issue was a very interesting experiment that in the end, had the effect of actually raising the price after all was said and done. It gave the community more confidence that Bitcoin can take whatever comes it's way. This is just another test of what will probably be many and each time Bitcoin passes it becomes stronger. HODL!

In comparison, mining with hardware does nothing more then waste electricity. PoS allows for the network to run far more cheaply, mining makes you a small amount and paying to use the system costs a small amount. Bitcoin is clearly going to have problems offering micro transactions for this very reason.

Not merged != diverged. Doesn't matter anyway, the point is that the number of BU commiters has nothing to do with anything. Its sole job at the moment is raising the blocksize and forcing core to raise their max blocksize. Anything outside of that is unnecessary risk to that goal.  
@_date: 2015-05-05 12:58:22
Why aren't we incentivizing the running of nodes? Bitcoin needs more transaction types in order to bring in more fees for running nodes. Bitcoin should adopt a sort of proof of stake system where you run nodes by staking bitcoin and in doing so provide certain resources that the network needs, while being rewarded with fees for special transaction types.
@_date: 2015-05-07 11:22:25

The vision will become more clear over the next few weeks, it could easily become one of the most exciting things to hit crypto since bitcoin itself.

Why isn't running a node incentivized with proof of stake? Having to stake bitcoins could prevent people from spinning up nodes to sybil attack the network, while ensuring the nodes have a stake in the system, and for this they should be rewarded a piece of transaction fees.

Yes that is what I am saying. We are moving to a world with many different currencies and much more choice for when you would like to use one or the other. The key innovation of bitcoin is not it's deflationary aspects but one of choice. Instead of the closed door model of the current financial system we now have an open model that we can choose for ourselves when is the best time to use and for what and how that fits into our beliefs. Not only that but the fact that it can all be done in a machine readable language will allow for a type of innovation that fiat money could only dream of. You are missing the point entirely.
And the fact that frivolous wants are what keep our economy healthy points far more to a sickness in our economy rather then with the currency itself.

Voting with CPU power is the ONLY way bitcoin was designed to come to consensus. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:33:46
I'm talking about the recent attack where a company spun up thousands of nodes that were not responding as they should and sybilling/DDOSing the network. If they were forced to stake some btc for everyone of those nodes, such an attack would become much more expensive. Nodes staking more btc could be considered more stable.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:12:39
Well that's where we'll have to disagree. The incentives behind pow in terms of miners losing money if they make incorrect decisions is a very important part of solving the inevitable disagreements that would arise over the evolution of a global world currency. Which is also why POS will appear to work until it breaks down in such a scenario.    
Of course, nodes are important too. Every actor in the ecosystem has the incentive to do what they think is best and that melting pot is what forms EC.   
Edit: every species in the ecosystem has their attack/defense methods. Nodes have numbers, uasf, pow change, developers have the ability to put out the code they want to see run, miners have hashpower, exchanges have fork management/arbitrage... Each of these keep the others in check, again forming EC. EC is nothing new, it's been happening since the beginning of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:29:53
Right, because that's exactly what business want to deal with at the checkout line.
@_date: 2016-01-02 16:14:07
You are correct, there is very much a ying yang relationship between the users and the miners. The miners hash power is however the main consensus mechanism, noting that miners are incentivized to vote "correctly" because if they vote wrong they lose money. Either way, the hash power has the final say in consensus, even though their hands are fairly tied as to what that final consensus is.
Roger Murdock put it quite nicely:
"I was just thinking about this issue of who's in control of Bitcoin -- the "economic majority" or the "mining majority." Now I think it's ultimately the former, but that doesn't mean that a mining majority can't exert tremendous influence. Imagine that there's a hard fork of Bitcoin that adds feature X and that the economic majority values a Bitcoin network with feature X more than a Bitcoin network without feature X. That doesn't mean that the fork with X would win out over the no-X chain if most of the hash power didn't quickly go along. Why? Because what almost everyone values infinitely more than any one individual feature is the network effect. And when you're conducting "fork arbitrage" and attempting to guess which fork will win (i.e., what everyone else will value more in the future), the fork with the most hash power behind it is a very strong Schelling point for the market to converge on -- even if that's the fork that doesn't include the desired feature. (Note that the majority hash power / no-X fork obviously still retains the latent ability to add feature X at some point in the future, which is something the market can price in.)
On the other hand, if the mining majority attempted to get behind a fork that fundamentally destroyed some aspect of Bitcoin's value proposition (e.g., changing the reward schedule), the market would not simply go along and would instead sharply discount the fork with the change. That discounting would tend to drive economically rational miners back to mining the version of Bitcoin the market valued.
So, in short, while it's true that "miners will tend to follow the market," it's also true that "the market will tend to follow miners" (at least to a point)."

Well that's a pretty bullshit statement if I've ever saw one. Even if 100% of the BU switched to SW it still would not have the numbers to activate. BU isn't blocking anything. 
It doesn't matter how many people are working on LN implementations, it is still not usable for any real world use case today. My point stands, it is not some magical solution to all our ailes today. Until we have a product that works just as well as the bitcoin blockchain, it is vaporware at best.  (That doesn't mean it won't be great one day, just that it is not today.)

What are you even talking about? Nobody is in full charge of Bitcoin. If BU hard forks (Doesn't even have to be BU, just has to be nodes compiled to accept &gt; 1mb) and it becomes the majority chain, then core will be forced to merge in the same code in order for their client to continue. Then the development teams will all continue developing their clients exactly the same as before - with nobody in charge - and users running the code they support.

@_date: 2017-03-31 13:54:35
This is a common misconception... EC doesn't change anything that isn't already possible. Nodes still set their maxblocksize... currently 1mb. EC only allows for the network to signal for Xmb, allow the miners to track when they'd feel comfortable pushing a bigger block. If their block is not accepted, they lose money, so they are in the best position to gauge the acceptance of a bigger block. They do NOT have the ability to push a bigger block then the rest of the network is willing to accept. Large miners do not have any special priviliges and all miners can collect more fees from on chain transactions, which is exactly what I want to see. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:12:38

@_date: 2017-03-30 21:18:41
The things is, with EC the nodes ARE still in charge of the MAX limit. They will not be in charge of miners lowering the limit once a new max has been allowed however.

I actually cannot believe that, after all of Core's arguments against raising the blocksize, (contentious hard fork being dangerous, NOT that 2mb is inherently bad) that they would rather change the pow then cooperate to scale the system 2mb. Both being a hard fork, both being the same level of risk they've been worried about this whole time, yet this is what they would rather spend their resources on. Eye opening to the say the least.

Jl777: I think there are 100,000 blocks worth of signatures that need to be verified, which is still a lot of sigs, but with the parallel architecture, all cores can be used for this. since for historical blocks, the odds of invalid sig being in the blocks are low, I think this mass sig validation can happen while the data set is being compressed. For slower connections, there should be plenty of time, but I still need to replace openssl with the secp lib. I read it was 3x to 5x faster, but the sig validation wont affect the read only usage so probably can just do it in the background and warn/prevent the user from doing any money tx until the validation completes

UASF would be a great technique to use in the face of, for example, the chinese government forcing a software update upon all their miners that the rest of the world doesn't want. It would be a great defense for the rest of the world to prevent such an attack. However, it is clear that Segwit is a contentious change and forcing such a change using possible sybiled nodes is probably not a good idea. It has just as much splitting risk as a contentious hard fork. However, my thoughts on that would change if all the big businesses in Bitcoin stood up and said they support USAF... Just like if they all stand up and say they are running software that accepts 2mb BU's forking mechanism would become a lot more safe. USAF is just a fancy word for what amounts to basically the same thing as a POW change... and should only be used in emergency situations IMO.

Ummm... Bitcoin by design expects every actor to act in a profit maximizing way. If you aren't aware of this then maybe Bitcoin isn't for you. Btw, increasing the blocksize doesn't mean they have any more control. They still cannot increase the blocksize more then nodes are willing to allow them.

My point is that even with an unbounded block size it would not be in the miners best interest for it to grow excessively, creating unlimited demand for free transactions as core is worried about. The nodes could also still enforce a limit if they saw a large miner bullying others. This means that EC should create a natural and dynamic block size and is the only solution that would be able to dynamically respond to user demand as the need arises.

@_date: 2017-03-14 02:31:29
So? And we saw what happened. The miner lost money, and the network continued working fine, which is to be expected.
@_date: 2017-03-28 01:11:46
Which is exactly why the numbers need to be entered by humans. Hence EC.
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:16:19
You don't think the miners as a whole would want to keep the block size lower in order to find the sweet spot between pushing fees up and users screaming fees are too expensive, paying them all collectively more money? 
Through this mechanism I could see them slowly increasing the block size (as they've been doing for 8 years) keeping fees at an optimal level.
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:22:36
Both sides want what is best for Bitcoin. It's great that nodes are showing their support for one solution but it is still clear that the network as a whole considers it to be contentious for more reasons then an "attack". This would create equal risk of a split as a hard fork (if not higher, due to nodes not being a safely measurable metric). I can't claim to know exactly how this is going to play out but the different actors in the network are likely to keep taking baby steps, in lock step, that will eventually lead to some kind of solution. The rising fees will continue to put more and more pressure until a breaking point and some kind of a "safe" compromise forming across the ecosystem. I believe that this is how Nakamoto consensus was meant to work and this will be Bitcoin's first true test as to whether or not that design will lead to workable solutions to such disagreements. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:49:08
And this perfectly explains why BU will not lead to miners creating giant blocks. A market equalibreum between maximizing fees and appeasing users will be found on the free market.

All software contains bugs, and unfortunately this is a new set of developers that may not be as familiar with one of the most complex codebase in the world as some of the longstanding developers. But everyone has to start somewhere - they are not yet the majority client so they still have some wiggle room without bringing down the network. Good thing these are being found now - and a good reason for multiple implementations. Core isn't immune from defects either - could happen to them one day. 
Currently BU devs are the only ones that are at all capable/willing to provide us with a hard fork block size increase and their hearts are in the right place so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:32:18
Nobody is going to do a 51% contentious HF. This is heresy. As Gavin Andreson put it, "The miners are not idiots".

Sorry, but that's just your perspective. There are clearly two sides here, both with opinions on how Bitcoin should grow. One sides opinions are not more valid then the other sides. Bitcoin incentivizes people to behave in their own best interest, this is how the system works. Just because you don't agree doesn't mean the other side is inherently "wrong" or is an "attack". Don't be so selfish.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:18:34
I never said "we should listen to them because it's for their profit". I said of course they are going to attempt to make decisions that maximize their profits. I am not "listening to them" I am listening to my own heart, I am of the belief that the more profits miners are able to make, the more miners there will be and the more decentralized the mining will become. Raising the blocksize will raise the number of users, raise the fees miners are able to collect, securing and decentralizing the system to all new highs. So I am in line with their need to maximize profits. 
In fact, I believe it will be in miners best interest to keep the blocksize as low as possible, in order to keep fees as high as possible for all miners. There will likely be a sweet spot between fees being too high and blocks being too small, miners are in the best position to understand this. Nodes will also be in a position to not allow miners to raise blocksize too much, but as fees become too high for them they will become more open to allowing miners to raise the size up. It will be a delicate balancing act from all parties... Hence emergent consensus. A single fixed number or growing % based increase will not be able to solve this dynamic need.
@_date: 2017-03-30 22:49:34
EC is just a signalling protocol, BU is just one such implementation of this mechanism. Bitcoin Classic, XT and now BitcoinEC all support the EC signalling protocol, to say a communication protocol is a red herring doesn't make much sense.  
I watched the birth of EC and BU on a very small forum, from when it was just a little sperm of an idea, and I can say with absolute certainty it was not a government attack. It was clearly a grassroots movement of developing ideas that were eventually implemented and taken up by a portion of the community. Miners had no part in its development that early on and I highly doubt it was the government given the long term personalities of the main people involved. Some I had highly respected for years and had a number of private communications with as far back as 2011. These people always wanted what's best for Bitcoin so really that's just conspiracy stuff.

@_date: 2017-01-27 22:18:42
That will be up to the network to determine. If BU "were" to ever fork, this is how I would expect it to happen:
First the miners will begin signalling. Once there is enough hash power signalling 2mb, we would begin to see a number of large bitcoin companies (coinbase, bitpay, wallets, dark markets etc...) begin to promote that they are willing to accept bigger blocks. (This btw is the exact same effect that will prevent miners from unilaterally being able to control the blocksize.... the community must come with them or miners will fork themselves away from the economic majority.) We would also begin to see a number of community members writing blogs/threads/Reddit posts and sentiment would be gauged. After a miner then becomes sufficiently satisfied that the opportunity of mining a bigger block is &gt; the risk of the network rejecting it, this brave miner will attempt a ~1.05mb block and we will see what happens. It's beautiful really.
@_date: 2017-01-28 05:53:13
Exactly. That is precisely why that is not how it is going to go down. Miners will defend themselves from this kind of attack and it will therefore be a non existent problem. Just like how the threat of a mining algorithm change keeps miners in check, the very well known idea of its existence prevents it from getting to that.

@_date: 2017-01-27 21:57:06
It's also possible to generate the same private key as someone else. That doesn't mean it's going to happen. It's a strawman. The Bitcoin incentives are aligned such that people will not set their client preferences to settings that would open them up to attack. The ecosystem will use BU to move in unisen, when they are ready.
@_date: 2017-01-28 03:18:38
I'm not saying the miners will all be benevolent, what I am saying is all of the miners and nodes will not be stupid enough to scatter their settings all over the place, and open themselves up to attack. While as you say, miners may try to do whatever the protocol allows them, but other miners will also do whatever they can to defend themselves. This is all simple game theory.

Not only is there likely to be less buyers for bch, but the inflation will also be heavily increased. This should have the effect of lowering the price once miners can begin dumping, dropping the profitibility back down further as to make mining less and less interesting. At the end of the day btc will remain mostly stable and as usual, the honey badger don't give a fuck.
@_date: 2017-01-30 19:49:22
The idea of emergent block size consensus has absolutely nothing to do with the developers.

@_date: 2017-01-27 20:24:59
No miner will mine such a block unless they are sure the network will accept it, else they will lose money everytime! The incentives of Bitcoin are aligned such that these "attacks" of yours simply will not happen in the real world.
People will not all be running with different AD/EB settings either! We will organize around certain Schelling points, exactly like we do today. Nothing has changed from what is already possible today, any miner can already modify their blocksize by simply recompiling the code yet, for some strange mystical reason, they do not do this! Hmmm.... BU does nothing but remove a little friction on what is already possible.
You completely fail to understand the incentives that keep Bitcoin running.       
@_date: 2017-01-27 22:09:29
It IS designed to work in adversarial conditions! That is my whole point! Nakamoto Consensus protects us from people simply changing the code and breaking the system. Unless the supermajority of users want the change, the change will not happen!

@_date: 2017-01-28 17:57:11
Why put it some code to up the blocksize? Hmm I wonder? Sure, it will be a delicate ecosystem balancing act, but I believe it will be possible. It might even take a crisis to trigger it, us humans can be very resourceful when our backs are in a corner. But at least some alternative code is ready and being tested for when that time comes.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:06:51
I agree. I've been pondering the dynamics of bch quite a bit and this thought crossed my mind many times and I am glad to see this post here.
Fees are something that bch can't modify and can't get more of unless they gain widespread economic usage beyond 8mb. The extra $20,000 in fees happening right now on btc reward pushes it even more profitable making the available hash rate available to power mine bch and dump all that much quicker. The fees also show where the real economic activity lies, if people are willing to pay these kinds of fees then it's because they truly value usage of the chain.
After fees become an even bigger part of the reward it will be very hard for forks to compete unless they gain the economic majority at the time of the fork.

How is mining a block no one accepts guarantee that they will make money by gathering a large short position and mining a bad block, then getting out of their short all at the right time? All while having spent enough money to amass enough miner or pool goodwill to be able to mine consistantly enough. Sounds awfully risky to me.


By downloading the code and changing the constant and recompiling. This is basically the exact same thing people are doing when they make the conscious decision to run BU. Nothing stops people from doing either. It is part of the protocol.

The point is that if BU doesn't remove the friction, anyone else in the world can and will! The incentives of Bitcoin were designed such that this is not a problem. If you honestly believe that removing a little friction by modifying a bit of code is enough to bring down the system, then you must believe Bitcoin is already dead in the water.

You do realize that these pool operators will be unable to raise the blocksize without the majority of full nodes being willing to go along with it as well, right? No miner is going to risk losing money by mining a block that the rest of the network rejects. This would mean that if a bigger block manages to be mined then it is because it was precisely "a conscious, voluntary, decision by network participants everywhere"

I think you misunderstand how evolution works. The non-dominant side will continue trying and trying and trying until the environment changes such that they are successful (or never successful and becomes extinct). This is the same in nature, in politics (see Trump) and many other aspects of life in general. This is how we have progressed as a species and made it this far, along with every other species on this planet. Get used to it.
If the other side was not working so hard to make their wishes known, it would make the path far too easy on the dominant side to take over completely and have way too much power. For every action there needs to be an equal and opposite reaction to keep things in check. The ying and yang of nature is important to ensure we don't swing to wildly to one side. Both sides have wishes and both constantly working on them will cause a middle ground to form in a way it wouldn't have had one side not existed. Both sides have every right to work hard and make their wishes known, whether you like it or not, it's not for you to decide.

Your hurting the entire core name and it effects the peoples view of core and blockstream as a whole, causing outbursts like this. Why don't you step down? What is in all this for you?

I've been trying to build such a service but I've been having trouble figuring out how to get well connected enough with enough incoming funded channels to allow users to always find routes without opening a channel themselves. Can you provide any feedback or best practices for bootstraping something like this?

We get it, people use Bitcoin to move money. Why do we need a post every time someone does so?

Looks like a pretty obvious downtrend to me...
@_date: 2018-06-06 11:37:12
yup, 
@_date: 2016-11-22 03:44:21
I'm talking about nodes that matter, like bitpay, coinbase, exchanges, lbc, darknets, gambling sites, users etc... Miners can't just up the limit without these people on board, they'll simply lose money.
@_date: 2018-06-01 14:59:52
i'd say pretty far: 
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:41:07
And that testing was indeed run. However, as you know, such testing can't always uncover every possible issue. Ie. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 03:42:56
Who said it has no effective block size limit. BU indeed has block size limits, so I'm not sure what implementations you're talking about.
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:35:24
Again, it doesn't matter until enough of the ecosystem is signalling a change, and they won't all signal a change until they know for sure it is safe. It's very simple.
@_date: 2016-11-13 14:50:58
What do you know about open transactions? What ever happened to that, voting pools were supposed to be huge.
@_date: 2016-12-14 23:13:20
You really overestimate him if you think he's somehow singlehandedly holding bitcoin back.
@_date: 2016-12-11 06:02:34
I'm running it. I'm not losing any money. It appears you've missed my point entirely.
@_date: 2016-11-29 05:30:44
Well then you obviously don't understand BU. The whole point is that when they do fork, it will be precisely because the network is ready to make it bitcoin. Not a moment before.
@_date: 2016-12-14 20:30:42
Well that sure didn't take long to discredit, typical.
@_date: 2016-12-14 21:03:24
It is up to the miners to determine that and decide if the risk of attempting a bigger block is &lt; the reward, otherwise they will lose a lot of money. The incentives are aligned.   
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:19:58
Except this is a brand new concept in an area absolutely anyone in the world has any experience with, trying to break new ground in consensus. Testnet does not have the value to properly test this and until the network is ready to mine &gt; 1mb BU software is perfectly safe. If the network becomes ready to mine &gt; 1mb with BU that would infer that BU has already been deemed safe, it's a non sequitur.
@_date: 2016-12-11 02:58:36
Good thing it's a free open source software with no employer.
@_date: 2016-11-13 17:46:19
Regardless, even in it's current state, Bitcoin is still better - and eventually, one way or another, it's capacity will continue to increase.

Also significant to note, Anthony has sold off most of his ether! 
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:01:05
For now, lbc works fine. Bitsquare is still something great that should be developed and waiting in the wings if lbc ever becomes the target if intensive regulations.
@_date: 2016-12-10 20:08:59
It has absolutely nothing to do with the quality of their work. Nice try though.
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:22:37
No they don't. Nothing in the protocol says they need to show anything.
@_date: 2016-12-11 06:03:59
The point was that this has absolutely nothing to do with the quality of their code.
@_date: 2016-11-13 19:16:57
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:23:23
I connected to this from node using request js no problem. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:02:36
Also, BU is NOT currently incompatible with itself, because the network is  unable to handle &gt; 1mb blocks at the moment. Until this becomes a reality, BU is completely 100% compatible with itself AND core - and it will only ever become a reality if the majority of the network believes it is safe - which would mean this issue has been neutralized.
BU's emergent consensus is a ying yang of the network accepting bigger blocks, but they will only accept bigger blocks if the network believes it is safe. Until it is provably safe, it will not happen. If it does happen, it is because the network has deemed it safe, making your points irrelevant.
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:33:39
No. A single batched transaction could actually contain 100 transactions. Not only that but any offchain transfer like lightning or internal exchange tx like coinbase to coinbase is also not counted.

Wtf is bitcash
@_date: 2018-06-19 22:42:34
Awesome, thanks. Is this what you meant by moneni?  I guess you have to trust them with your funds? How do you go about asking a node to open a channel with you? If you remember the names of those services plz let me know:)
@_date: 2016-12-06 15:43:51
umm, that chart is still in a very obvious downtrend.

@_date: 2019-06-24 19:02:48
The point is such "decentralized" systems all have a point of centralization making their decentralization useless. Hodl hodl has decentralized the correct pieces using multisig while avoiding all the bloat the comes with making useless "decentralized" apps.

Btc.tothemoon.me is a very creative multiplayer gambling game.
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:00:16
I clearly said that that in the latter, the available stake is likely not even for sale! So no, with enough money it still may not be possible to buy enough to attack a POS system, providing it's well established and distributed. Perhaps you could convince people to sell by creating a 100,000x price increase, but then you'd be hella poor, and many of the currencies users hella rich. 
There is no way to to do one person one vote, that is exactly why mining was created.
@_date: 2015-08-27 20:08:14
Well you sound like you've made up your mind regardless of what I say. Pleasure talking with you.
@_date: 2015-08-23 22:22:51


Guess what, bitcoin miners can merge mine both XT and core chain and they could also do it with an unlimited number of other forks. Please tell me how this is any different?
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:51:35
I wonder if they'll be allowed to talk about [redacted] or just be booted out for doing so.
@_date: 2015-08-24 19:04:50
Has anyone considered building a client that stored only unspent UTXO as it downloads the blockchain? Shouldn't this be enough data to be fully validating?
@_date: 2015-08-11 12:37:43
That's exactly the problem. Nobody can come to an agreement. So somebody needs to stand up and actually DO something rather then just sitting around disagreeing!
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:25:07
and it's never allowed to gain consensus because it is censored from the main communication portals.

Now that's a hard fork!
@_date: 2015-08-27 18:29:08
It is true. Instantdex itself doesn't "host" the trades. It only plugs in to many different kinds of systems in a completely platform agnostic way to accomplish trades in any way it possibly can. 
The orderbooks themselves live in a completely decentralized "cloud" network of computers running supernet software and the trades are negotiated between the two parties using any method they wish, via exchange, atomic coin swap, micropayment channels, multigateway voting pool, nxt asset exchange, and many other methods will be coming.
It also has other bonus features like allow you to connect to a large set of centralized exchanges and view all their prices in a single unified UI. The system can also detect and point out all kinds of arb opportunities across all exchanges/decentralized orderbooks etc. It will be a good tool for making money!
Also, all the trades that happen off exchange have only a couple cent fee, rather then a % based fee like we're used to with centralized exchanges!
@_date: 2015-08-23 23:23:24
Of course you could still merge mine. The only thing that's changes is the block size, All the other rules are the same. Why would that become incompatible with merge mining? If you can merge mine bitcoin and namecoin then you can merge mine bitcoin and bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-18 21:35:09
Oh well. Its happening regardless.
@_date: 2015-08-06 17:14:03
If someone gains access to your trezor can they steal all your coins? I like bip38 because you require both the paper and to extract the long password from my head. Can this be achieved with trezor as securely?
I guess you also have to backup your seed... is that yet another thing someone could gain access to and steal all your coins?
@_date: 2019-02-06 15:57:32
Also seems to forget that segwit and batching have greatly increased that number. Sad times.

@_date: 2015-08-11 14:22:39
Everyone agrees just fine on the amount of bitcoins that should exist. That isn't currently crippling the network and has nothing to do with this. 
I signed up for Bitcoin that was scalable and had a block limit that was supposed to be removed once the network reached a certain level of adoption. Bitcoin is gambling it's existence by changing these assumptions.
@_date: 2015-08-23 11:17:40
It clearly is VERY relevant given one means total censorship of discussion.
@_date: 2015-08-20 02:42:26
What about their censoring of the famous Gold collapsing, Bitcoin UP thread? That is straight up censorship.
@_date: 2015-08-27 17:52:06
Instantdex is meant to be a currency/platform agnostic version of a decentralized exchange. It can connect to exchange APIs to give you a single unified view across all exchanges(and automatically detect arb opportunities), it can use the multi gateway voting pool platform to allow cross coin trading of many currencies, especially btc, without the need for a centralized exchange. It will also be extended to allow for atomic cross coin swaps  for many currencies/assets and many more will be added in the future. The team behind it is also working on a brand new pegging system that requires no extra margin like bitshares, even pays interest, and will allow for things like USD or gold to become a first class citizen on instantdex.
The "Instant" part comes from the fact that this is running a network of computers all participating in the supernetwork. This allows for the decentralized orders books to exist in a decentralized way across all machines that are instantly updatable and trades instantly clearable as they are matched. This is possible due to a complex p2p messaging protocol that underlies the core of the supernetwork, which also includes methods for extremely private coin transactions and messaging known as teleport and telepathy. (this includes adding extreme levels of privacy to bitcoin transactions without modification to the bitcoin protocol itself)
This is just the beginning. This platform has a long roadmap for future extension.

That is the whole point of XT. To force a blocksize change. but in the end it really doesn't matter if people run XT or if a homeless person on the side of the street produces a fork with just the blocksize increase and calls it BITCOIN DICKFUZZ. In the end, the blocksize is going to increase, and that's what this is all about.
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:40:49
Here's one interview with a core dev that might answer your question: 
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:47:00
Seems like [REDACTED] is reaching economic consensus. But I guess it's still just an altcoin and has no consensus.
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:44:19
That isn't at all the same thing and you know it. But a tweet from a single idiot is one hell of an argument!
And yes, that's one reason, fees are now too expensive for the other 6 billion. 
The other reason is that if we find ourselves in another stage of  adoption, the system will buckle and there will not be enough time to push a change through, driving new users away. We are very close to the limit. It won't take much to push us over.
@_date: 2015-08-27 19:53:59
When you're allowed to connect to any trading mechanism you wish, a centralized exchange just being one of the many possible choices, I do call it decentralized.

Instantdex actually only uses Nxt for one type of its trades. It will also support atomic cross coin trades, plugging into centralized exchanges, pegged coins and any other way you can conceive of to trade a coin/asset. Instantdex is platform agnostic and aims to unite everything in crypto under one roof.

@_date: 2015-08-24 16:57:39
Whatever, I don't give a shit where it was implemented. The fact is XT forced a conversation that needed to happen and put people's backs against the wall. It was the only way to get shit done. A homeless person's fork called BITCOIN DICKFUZZ could have done the same job. 
It also had the fun effect of showing a few people's true colours.

@_date: 2015-08-11 14:49:02
Miners already have an incentive to not push blocks that are too large. The block race. This has already kept blocks pumping out smaller then the limit. They will only push out larger blocks when the fees in that block outweigh the potential losses of losing the block race and the system will find an equilibrium.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:59:23

If you have the money you can buy enough hash power. What's the difference? I'd think the price of the stake would drastically increase if you tried to buy that much, in many cases, its not even for sale.

It will also support atomic cross coin trades via different mechanisms and can plug into centralized exchanges to present a single unified view that quickly point out arbitrage opportunities across coins and assets.

@_date: 2015-08-27 19:46:18
Actually instantdex is about as decentralized as you can get. it can be connected to any trade mechanism that could ever exist and is fully extensible. mgwbtc is just one of the many methods. Atomic cross currency trades will also be supported, using micropayment channels. The platform is simply a method of creating decentralized orderbooks and meeting up two people to make a trade in an automated fashion. The way they make the actual trade is another layer. Supernet itself provides a number of out of box implementations of these layers, but is fully extensible by third parties.
@_date: 2015-07-03 12:50:41
I think It's actually 0.5 - 1.5%. The multiplayer puts that fluctuating 1% up for grabs by the players if I understand correctly.
@_date: 2019-06-25 02:49:55
Perhaps. But releasing early applies here and they will improve. The point is that many of these "decentralized" apps can be solved with normal multisig and the problems that arise by doing something on ethereum for example are likely solved by a more simple solution with the same trade offs. This is a step in the right direction imo and we will see if I'm correct but there needs to be tradeoffs when it comes to decentralization and from what I can see hodl hodl is the closest to getting it yet.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:12:04
Uhhhh.. good for you? I don't see what is newsworthy about this.

In this sense, ledger makes far more sense then limiting ourself to the term "money".
@_date: 2015-07-31 22:15:24
That is a good point. There will be more fees paid and therefore will help contribute to more miners, but I'm not sure those fees will cover the same amount of value as all these securities stored on the Blockchain could potentially be worth.

I wonder how this relates to the bitcoin community. Who are the sociopaths?
@_date: 2015-07-31 21:41:12
Anyone else worried that all these coloured coins could actually throw off the system incentives? Mining power is supposed to grow in correlation with the value the network is protecting (rising coin price =more miners = higher cost for 51%). These crypto securities are effectively raising the value on the Blockchain without raising the incentive to protect. Is this a problem?

My point is that another centralized service is going to to inevitability fall into the same traps Reddit did. I always knew this day would come for Reddit because of it's centralized ownership which is sad given Reddits current importance to the internet as a whole. But what i don't get is why everyone us getting so excited about repeating history with yet another centralized service. The type of important data that Reddit collects and archives should not belong to a single company, it should belong to the Internet.

This is a good idea... Querying multiple nodes on the network for a hash every 1000 blocks or so should work great, then when you get to the end you just keep the last x blocks &amp; unspent outputs.
@_date: 2016-02-15 14:43:43
We needed be so afraid of hard forks. However we do need to practice them while the network is still young. Actually going through and capturing data will be infinitely more valuable then trying to blindly plan a massive one for a few years down the road.
@_date: 2017-04-16 16:51:22
Oh well. The facts are the facts and Poon at least already has a working implementation. We can either bitch about it or learn from mistakes and push forward.

Well then you haven't been looking very hard - and you also don't understand EC, because it cannot be activated successfully without most of the economy / network / whatever.
@_date: 2016-02-24 03:53:37
All we need is for the price to at least double every four years. Getting more users is the best way to do that.
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:36:38
Sure and those most certainly will work. Just their very threat is enough to prevent most 51% attack in my opinion, so no I am not really worried. 
My point is that the issue you have pointed out does not relate to what is currently going on with the blocksize. Bitcoin EC is a larger movement then just Jihan - blaming him and then claiming if we raise the blocksize via EC we open the door for him to 51% the network just seems silly.
@_date: 2017-04-17 21:23:45
Beautiful. These reports are great, Thanks. Lbc is such a great indicator. Strong Bastian of hope for keeping your head straight through all this drama.

What's the point in even talking to these people?
@_date: 2016-02-24 17:54:38
That would make the reward 4 times higher then today... My point was to at least keep the miner reward from being lowered by the halving. Not sure why you're being so picky.

I bet he is friedcat.

No you didn't.
@_date: 2016-02-15 16:31:57
The blocksize is not and never was supposed to be a spam limit. The spam limit is decided as an emergent property of the network based on what miners are willing to accept into a block. An attacker could not create a giant block of spam because their block would be orphaned at a huge monetary loss to themselves. This would also assume they want to attack the resource they have a huge stake in mining, which goes completely against the incentives of the network. Even if such an attacker existed and they managed to mine such a block, maybe it would work once, but it's effects would be temporary as the rest of the network learns what is going on a reacts accordingly, not much unlike an immune system.
The network does not need central planning magic numbers to function. It is a decentralized project at it's core and it's a complete joke that people think it needs a central planner to make it work. Trust in the free market to find solutions, that's what Bitcoin is all about.

@_date: 2016-02-26 19:57:41
Not really... Once the source is published the whole world will have the burger King stealer app, and bitcoin will get a bad rap. Thank you core devs!
@_date: 2017-04-12 15:42:38
Lol, so that's what's working hard looks like.
@_date: 2017-04-29 02:46:50
Except it's not. The blocksize limit is 1mb and the blocksize limit will still be 1mb after segwit. Segwit will change the block *weight* limit, not the size.
@_date: 2016-02-15 15:02:40
hard forks themselves should not be hard to achieve... changes to the consensus protocol should be. The blocksize was never meant to be part of the consensus protocol and therefore removing or bumping it is a valid reason for a hard fork, and should be very easy.
@_date: 2017-04-25 18:28:14
Except you are also paying their rather large spread.
@_date: 2016-02-19 09:59:58
Except does it really matter?
@_date: 2017-04-03 20:14:15
This is nothing but adversarial hypothetical thinking. The only thing anyone ever said about that is it would be "possible" for majority miners to turn around and kill the minority chain. Nobody at BU is "proposing" this. This is not even something that BU CAN propose - it's not up to them. This is 100% in the arena of the miners to decide for themselves. In reality, this would likely not be neccassary since the minority chain will already be heavily limited all by itself. 
The Bitcoin protocol works by the actors it employs working in their own rational self interest. That's how it was designed to work. If there is a reality where the miners decide it is in their best interest to attack the minority chain then they will attack it.... This is how the protocol was designed. However, the protocol was also designed to prevent a minority chain from living so such an attack will be extremely unlikely and unnecessary. If you cannot trust in how the protocol was designed to work then you should just sell your coins now. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 22:10:31
2 fucking years from now? Do you not realize that bitcoin needs to keep it's momentum going if it plans to meet the expectations placed on it? Not only that but the block reward schedule does not give us infinate time to just sit around fucking the dog on these upgrades. This is the god damned digital age, things are moving faster then ever before and you want to take another 2 damn years to get shit done? What is this "research" that you believe requires 2 years to complete?
If you believe that it won't go smoothly unless we take this much time, then why on earth would you not take the bet?
@_date: 2016-02-23 12:05:58
Interesting how replace by fee is being hidden behind more gentler words...
@_date: 2017-04-14 02:53:24
You said it was the only proposal you've heard of. Then you continue to move the goal post... You heard it hear folks, extension blocks do not work well! Carry on!
@_date: 2017-04-03 18:58:02
I'm sorry but you cannot claim it is an attack. You are just framing an event with your personal opinion to make your point. There is no way you can know that - I personally believe it is EC and Nakamoto consensus working as intended and that Core is the attack. So why do you believe that you are more right then me? Am I an attacker too? I'm open to the idea that I could be wrong - but I believe that either way, Nakamoto Consensus will select the right answer... Nothing more.
@_date: 2017-04-23 22:37:26
Does it matter? At the end of the day people are signalling for big blocks and even if all they do is apply a patch to core that accepts 2mb that is still EC at work. BU is nothing but one implementation of EC - it was a way of starting the conversation. Which is exactly why claiming that BU devs will take over the protocol development if we fork to 2mb just makes no sense and is total FUD.
@_date: 2016-02-26 15:30:09
You go to jail?
@_date: 2016-02-26 15:30:37
But they can't confirm that you are using a legit wallet.
@_date: 2017-04-02 01:08:59

Except it is forced over tor, so do they really know much?
@_date: 2017-04-03 12:57:56
Well that's the problem isn't it? Everyone is so quick to judge without knowing anything about it.  It seems those who have bothered to actually understand it before forming conclusions and arguing on the internet see it's merit and want it... And those people are growing in numbers all the time.      
@_date: 2017-04-18 16:59:23
But they are going to allow ether? So people can just use ether to buy Bitcoin then? Would be a pretty pointless law.
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:04:51
Haha, ask around the office(if you still have any of the old employees). My name is well known. Considering the amount of business I gave Virtex over the years, and what little respect I got for it, Quadriga has already gone above and beyond to be kind to me and make my experience unmatched. 
But for heavens sake, update the website! I don't know if you still have to manually calculate your own withdrawal fees but there are many examples like that and things I've dealt with over the years that are just unacceptable given what an easy fix they would be.
@_date: 2017-04-16 16:56:37
Extension blocks are exactly that, so that's BS 
@_date: 2017-04-26 11:15:39
And it's market cap was way lower, there was no "space"

So a QC can't just replace by fee once you expose your public key?
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:02:56
And there is absolutely no evidence that 1 mb is that physical limit. Just picking a new number is not feasible and would be subject to the exact same issues as selecting 1mb was, hence the need for a market based dynamic block size. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 20:27:01
It says right there in the title, "Bitcoin Unlimited **Miners**" and "May Be". Again, it's all just hypotheticals.

@_date: 2016-02-23 18:07:34

@_date: 2017-04-14 02:49:59
Is this for real? Why aren't we soft forking to a bigger keyspace already?
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:26:40
Far cheaper to just use bitcoin. The shapeshift fee is way more then the current Bitcoin transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-04-28 13:50:56
Is there any solid evidence that we was not or not part of the group, "friedcat"? It would explain the massive amount of money Bitmain had for ASIC development - not to mention a massive head start. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 17:02:46
Lolwut? It's simple math. If the price doubles and reward halves, miners will be making the same amount...
@_date: 2016-02-11 12:32:57
Gavin has already done much of the work planning the hard fork... Of course it can be done at the same time.
@_date: 2016-02-19 03:05:21
I can promise you that I am not. I've just been following it's development for some time and am very excited about a new innovative way to use bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-04-19 18:02:36
Great argument. You win one internet.
@_date: 2017-04-28 17:22:41
Because Core is a horrible mess of code and it's about time someone does?
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:09:37
I use Bitcoin checker quite frequently and have been checking it for years... This has the benefit of now sort of being able to feel the "pulse" of Bitcoin and how it moves, allowing me to feel certain changes in price through my gut.
@_date: 2016-02-24 12:26:23
What I'm saying is that in order for miners to be making at least the same, the price has to double every fear years... Which it has far more then doubled every four years so far. If we expand the capacity of the blocks it will mean more users, more fees and higher price, which would more then make up for the 50% reduction of the inflation rate.
The inflation rate also means we don't have the time to sit around and waste, we need to get as many users as possible in the shortest amount of time.
@_date: 2016-02-24 18:03:53
Except it's not incorrect.
@_date: 2016-02-15 16:29:42
Bitcoin needs to gain mass adoption in order to outpace the banks and governments around the world. The sooner we get more people using it, the less of a chance of harsh regulation or other attackers having a chance of stopping it. We do not have time to waste, Bitcoin is serious business and it absolutely must stay ahead of the curve.
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:42:33
What gives you this impression? Where can I find more information about this? 
@_date: 2017-04-24 14:14:23
EC is an idea who's time has come. BU started the conversation, something else will finish it.
@_date: 2017-04-16 16:28:37
Sounds to me like extension blocks with asicboost protection is the only fair way forward. Both sides will be unhappy while still getting a good amount of what they want.... That's compromise.   
Yes it may take more time in development and testing but that's the nature of the decentralized beast. It's better then stalling for another 6 months only to have to start then if segwit still doesn't activate. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 12:20:50
Right, they couldn't​ possibly have their own opinion, that would be rediculous! 
@_date: 2017-04-28 17:21:01
It is obviously NOT an increase of the main existing blocksize which is exactly what he is referring to. Why are you being a jerk?
@_date: 2016-02-26 13:19:25
So what happens if you send them an rbf tx?
@_date: 2017-04-02 17:59:46
So basically what you are saying is that what if Jihan has &gt; 51% of the entire network and then launches an attack to kill the main chain? If you are worried that he can/will do that then Bitcoin is already broken. That's called a 51% attack. 
What's happening with the block size is involving many more miners and nodes then just Jihan and that is precisely why it could work - as per nakamoto consensus.
@_date: 2016-02-26 16:01:33
No it doesn't. But that doesn't mean we should make it any easier to scam people.
@_date: 2012-08-29 23:21:55

Wow, does PayPal not realize that this sort of action will only further the demand for bitcoin and accelerate their demise? 
@_date: 2012-12-13 22:36:28
Lol I know your trolling but that made me lawl. 
@_date: 2017-04-28 17:21:34
It is not. The blocksize he is referring to is still staying at 1mb. It is factually correct.
@_date: 2017-04-19 15:31:21
There's nothing absurd about it. You can't claim it's absurd just because it isn't in line with what you think. I have literally been involved in Bitcoin since the very early days of 2011 and I agree with everything they say here. I am not beholden to Bitmain, I am a long term believer in Bitcoin, one of the few remaining to have made it through all these years and I applaud Jihan and Via for standing up. Core runs their show like a bunch of arrogant pricks and even if segwit is the best code to have ever hit mankind(it's far from it) they have gone about it all the wrong way, and the market is punishing them for it.
PS, stop over using the word troll. I am not a troll, never have been and the use of the word troll to peg anyone who doesn't tow the line is frankly disgusting.

Why do you say that? I get normal bid/ask market, what I don't understand is how auction markets work. Especially related to this one in particular.

This is important information unrelated to how markets work.

So then, if nobody knows who is auctioning, then that means it is open to the public. Which makes it very possible it is winks unloading.
@_date: 2016-09-25 00:53:14

this shit is the biggest news to hit bitcoin in a loooooooong time. People just don't realize how big this really is. this is bitcoin's coming of age moment. It's netscape moment. It's plans of world domination are almost in place. Many alts are gonna be in a world of hurt and many new apps are going to begin being developed. Decentralized mixer running in the background of your wallet, solving privacy and fungability, check. Instant decentralized coin swaps (for the few coins that remain), check. No longer having to store your coins on an exchange in order to make an instant trade, check. Smart contract without affecting security of the base layer, check. All the merchants that dropped btc will be back after lightning, and many more, I guarantee it.

Yes, but I had hoped that lightning would increase privacy by allowing transactions to be routed off chain and hence go "dark". Things like dark onion routed mixing protocols would permanently unlink addresses from blockchain analysis linking due to not being able to figure out who got which coins from a dark channel.

Yup, it has forced all the users/businesses to squeeze out the most efficient use of the chain possible, there would have been no other way to incentivize this. As it turns out there are plenty of things that could be done first to make the most efficient use of the chain space and it's great to see people working on it. Meanwhile the size of the eth chain continues to grow at a rediculous speed, only time will tell how much of a problem that will become.

Pretty badass that the move to segwit is completely interopable with ability to send to and back and not being affected if you don't even have a segwit wallet. Seeing how long companies drag their feet, I bet getting everyone on board for a hard fork would be near impossible.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:01:06
Yup, the miners are only going to mine the chain that the economic majority are buying a using at the highest value. The only way the fork will get hashpower for a prolonged period of time is if all those actors have decided to value the fork. If that happens, the fork could be deemed a success and Bitcoin would carry on. 
Nakamoto consensus must be respected even if it is not what you personally want.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:37:36
No we wouldn't, because the economic majority gets the final say of what chain is valued and hence decides the market value. The work will follow that. Your example would be useless for that reason and hence the probability of the NSA doing that is about as low as generating somebody else's private key. Both are "possible", but extremely "improbable".
Bitcoin is a system of probabilities and incentives, throwing all kinds of unrealistic and improbable examples in the air doesn't change that or break the system.
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:52:58

@_date: 2017-10-25 15:53:04
Probably not the same probability but improbable enough. Given what you're saying would likely not work and only result in the loss of a great amount of money and business brand recognition, it would be pretty fucking supid and self descructive and the results could hardly be considered a hijacking of the entire protocol.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:12:35
It also doesn't include batched transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:39:20
The economic majority does not mean the miner subsidy. It means what chain is actually valued by the users. If the forkchain is somehow having it's mining subsidy covered @ a $100 Billion valuation while the market value of the forkchain is not 100 billion, I think this will be immediately obvious to just about everyone and the network as a whole will go into massive damage control, finding and attacking the perpetrators. 
Bitcoin incentivizes all of us to protect it with whatever tools and methods we can at our disposal, and would not go down without a massive fight just because some miners are receiving a temporary subsidy. This also assumes that a temporary subsidy is the ONLY thing that ALL miners care about, and that the other actors in the system aren't capable of a proper analysis into what's going on, which isn't the reality... This isn't a very realistic scenarion at all, if it happened it would be a very unlikely anomoly and the network as a whole would still have the ability to detect and protect against it.
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:30:36
Would it be possible to build a fast cheap mixing protocol on top of lightning? Then wallets could instantly mix coins on every send for a small fee?
@_date: 2017-09-07 02:55:25
These companies had over a year to get ready, what gives?
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:24:43
No, Bitcoin is indeed the chain with the most work done. The work is a barameter that measures the economic majority due to the nature of the incentives that make the system work. The wrong chain will never have the most work because the economic majority will not buy it and hence those miners will lose massive amounts of money.
Either we trust in the incentives of Nakamoto  Consensus or we don't, and if the latter then you should sell all your coins now.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:28:26
Sorry, but that's not how this works. 
Hash rate and hence most work will always follow the economic majority. This works because of the miners begin mining a new ruleset that the economic majority refuses to buy then they will lose massive amounts of money burning electricity. 
When we say Bitcoin is defined by the most work that is because of the very logical assumption that hash rate follows profit and doesn't mine to lose money, which is why most work is an excellent and only available measurement of the economic majority.
This is a case of probabilities and theory vs practice and in practice this works great with a high enough probability as to work. Bitcoin is based at its very core on these ideas. To reject them is to claim Bitcoin simply does not work, and you should sell now.

"If a payment system cannot block transactions, doesn’t require permission for use or offers anonymous use, eventually it will probably be shut down. This could be just as true for systems like Tether and Ripple, as it was for Liberty Reserve, E-Gold, E-Bullion and Digicash. A potential way around this is to try to build a distributed system that cannot be shut down (i.e. censorship resistance for the system as a whole)." - Lawlz

Uhhh, this is kind of a big deal isn't it? I thought OT was dead but so far this looks like a pretty solid wallet. That makes 2 wallets with payment codes now... Still not sure how OT features and bitmessage play a part but I am super excited that this is finally becoming a reality. There's a lot of similarities with this and Samouri wallet, both are really good. Gonna try to set up a payment code with myself now, looks like the new generation of wallets are among us. 
I remember that holy grail post from Chris on bitcointalk back in 2013... Bitcoin development is really picking up!
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:09:38
I think lightning has a self incentivizing growth mechanism whereby those who join early, and provide the most liquidity can get most well connected and would make more fees in the future. These early people are taking a risk for a big potential ongoing payout. It's beautiful.
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:34:56
What fun would that be?
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:07:39

@_date: 2015-04-28 15:12:57
Oops that's what I meant.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:04:15
In the universe where 2x somehow "succeeds", wouldn't that just mean it was a success, which by definition would mean Bitcoin is not doomed... It would mean that consensus was found via Nakamoto consensus. 
Now I don't believe that is the likely scenario, but even in that case I don't think it would spell the end of Bitcoin, it would be Bitcoin working as designed.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:14:06
Also, I never said anything about altcoins with different work having any bearing on what I'm talking about. I am talking about one chain in particular, the chain with the biggest widespread adoption and liquidity and market value - and how work measures the economic majorities will in deciding which fork is the real Bitcoin. I don't care about your altcoins and comparing the work across two of them has absolutely no importance whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:01:02
I find them easier to use to get out then to get in.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:16:56
Is there any info on how exactly this thing is supposed to work?
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:52:01
That actually would be quite a bit of money - not only that but it would be pretty obvious to the rest of the economic majority what would be going on. We'd all be very happy to dump our fork coin into whatever they are doing to somehow hold up a 100 Billion dollar market cap, while also buying up all the mined coins.... You really think they could do all this completely anonymously without any kind of leak and give the illusion that they are the economic majority, all the while there is a huge amount of people claiming they are absolutely not interested in forkcoin? They wouldn't be a very wealthy entity for long.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:09:24
I definately never said I wanted to give up any of that, you are just putting words in my mouth. Bitcoin is very possible and it is working wonderfully.

LN is already incentivizing nodes to link up as fast as possible to become most well connected and collect juicy fees. It also doesn't change the base protocol. Along with the many other user facing advantages I don't think it'll have a hard time taking of... As long as it works.

Thanks, maybe I'll give that a shot. 
Now, I've been using the wallet for a little while now, it doesn't seem to be doing any coin mixing. Where is that feature? Would be pretty badass if you could implement coinjoin and link it up to that network. Could be a good premium feature... Allowing a user to add their device as a market maker while their phone is plugged in and on wifi to make some money while you sleep would be amazing, and allow you to take a small cut as well... Could be a great boom to the coinjoin network too!

Awesome. Also, bit of an annoyance/bug. How come every time I lauch the app it spends 30-60 seconds on "retrieving transaction balance". Perhaps it should cache the data and do this loading in the background? The bug is that: even if the app is already running in the background and I launch again from the launcher, it will do this again, yet if I select the app from the multitask window, it continues to show the already loaded data. Forces me to always look for the app in the multitask history instead of tap the icon on my home screen cause I don't wanna wait forever...

Lightning support seems to work great but I had to open a channel with them first before I could find a route. I think once people open more channels with them, people will be able to deposit instantly without first opening a channel. It would be really neat if they added a feature where when placing an order, if you didn't have enough btc, a lightning invoice pops up where they can send the requires btc to instantly open the order. So excited for lighting, so much potential.

At any time your money can be used to spend on lightning or can be sent away in an on chain transaction... Your money is not locked up people! It's simply being stored in a preconfirmed transaction which can be changed at anytime!!

My point is, obviously everyone isn't just going to jump on BU overnight. Core is entrenched, that's obvious. But BU is slowing gaining in adoption, is getting funding, and is the only alternative client on *track* to competing with core. As the snowball gets going more and more people could jump in. Roger's pool is just another example of the growing snowball.  BU is offering grants, inclusive, respectful dev environments while core is nasty, rude and exclusive. Given enough time, we will certainly see which model fairs better. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 20:19:09
Permissionless innovation buddy. BU will fork when the network is ready.
@_date: 2016-10-02 23:39:45
Or..... he was testing on testnet so he could learn how things work..... I'm sorry not everyone is born with knowledge about the inner workings of bitcoin. I doubt Roger is even a coder.

Uh, didn't segwit fork on testnet as well? It's testnet.... Duh.
@_date: 2016-10-03 17:12:32
Once bitcoin is large and entrenched having many nodes is inevitable. But of course the uptake of such nodes will be very slow and calculated for the reasons you mentioned. As of now the fact is there is growing pressure to take bitcoin down a different path. Regardless of whether or not it is the correct path or takes over the network is irrelevant. The very idea that this pressure exists and is continuing to grow shows that there is an unserved need in the market. This pressure will cause both seen and unseen affects on core and the decisions they make and will continue to grow as long as core is not delivering what the growing populace wants. They will either concede on a few things and attempt to meet on the middle, or they will stand their ground steadfast until the growing pressure overtakes them. Either way, this movement is necessary to keep everyone honest, give everyone a voice and help move the protocol down mutually unhappy lines.
@_date: 2016-10-13 12:59:37
Well with core they'll fall behind after just one forked block and will never be able to recover, so it's still a much better choice.

This is the result of people not NEEDING to run full nodes. Majority of users are actually using mobile wallets and don't give a shit about running a full node. They only ever ran them before because it was the only option. I meet a number of these people on lbc, and where they used to bring laptops with full nodes, they now bring blockchain.info or the android Bitcoin Wallet.


Any solutions for this? Given that miners fight over the tinniest edge, ANY validation time would be too much. Big or small block, wouldn't they continue to do this regardless?


I'm glad one of you finally admit the relay network is a centralized service. Isn't this was XThin was created to combat?

No, they were not sufficiently good for me. It is however only a matter of time before somebody hits on the correct recipe for success. Evolution is constantly throwing shit at the wall until something sticks and Bitcoin's evolution is no exception.
 It was clear to me since the day of BU's release that it's strategy of emergent consensus was the only viable path forward as Bitcoin grows. (you can find my posts on bitco.in claiming just that) I was aware however that it was going to be a longer term game until it's ideas and understanding made their way into the communities conscious, but I am glad to see it is happening at a pace quicker then I ever expected.

Yes, and bitcoin will remain bitcoin no matter which client the network decides to run. No controversy, just change. The only constant in this world is change.

And let's not forget the fact that the attack is easily neutered by forking the mining algorithm, which makes this attack relatively useless for the cost.

All I see here is more baseless accusations with no evidence. Good job writing your big paragraphs of nothingness. I do however find it interesting you feel the need to spend so much effort on this when "nobody in their right mind" would go for it anyway. You did get one thing right though... The network decides every day - and what it decides can change quicker then you think.
@_date: 2016-10-16 20:19:06
Let's not forget how much lbc volume actually happens off escrow and unrecorded. As a past large seller myself I can assure you far more trades happen outside of the escrow then do.

@_date: 2016-10-17 18:28:37
This is exactly how I visualized such a hard fork playing out. First the miners will begin signalling. Once there is enough hash power signalling 2mb, we would begin to see a number of large bitcoin companies (coinbase, bitpay, wallets, dark markets etc...) begin to promote that they are willing to accept bigger blocks. (This btw is the exact same effect that will prevent miners from unilaterally being able to control the blocksize.... the community must come with them or miners will fork themselves away from the economic majority.) We would also begin to see a number of community members writing blogs/threads/Reddit posts and sentiment would be gauged. After a miner then becomes sufficiently satisfied that the opportunity of mining a bigger block is &gt; the risk of the network rejecting it, this brave miner will attempt a ~1.05mb block and we will see what happens. It's beautiful really.
@_date: 2016-10-16 21:43:13
Lol. Your point holds no merrit in this conversation.
@_date: 2016-10-03 18:55:07
a) hashcash is not proof of work
b) bitcoin is a mix of MANY more technologies then hashcash all done in just the right way to create the perfect receipe, to claim that is the key innovation of bitcoin is a fucking slap across Satoshi's face.
@_date: 2016-10-13 12:55:22
It's a much better place to put such power then in Maxwells hands. Miners won't be able to mine blocks larger then the economic majority of nodes are willing to accept. I never ceases to amaze me just how little the 'experts' in this space seem to understand the game theory of mining.
@_date: 2016-10-03 20:33:15
SHA256 is more of a key innovation then hashcash. We could go on forever.

Dude, it's not ripping anyone off. People meet people on lbc and do a trade, they then decide they trust eachother and exchange numbers, doing all future trades direct.

Hashcash was invented to protect against email spam by slowing down spammers.

Just because it also has information that is not important and/or useless (and a lot of it!), does not mean it does not also host a massive cache of important and helpful information on a wide variety of topics. It also matters a lot which subreddits you surround yourself with and what information you value.

I'm talking about far more then bitcoin. This content is valuable and should be available forever outside of the control of a single company. If we had a decentralized protocol for collecting and aggregating this information in a permanent and immutable way then it certainly could turn into something much bigger then Reddit itself is today. Such data could be analyzed in many different ways and would be an interesting thing for historical references to people in the future.

I apologize, I thought you meant Nxt itself so you may be right there. But this is a third party app that does nothing more then send messages on the Nxt blockchain, I'm not sure why it really matters if it's open source or not.

Miners wouldn't have to do anything, they'd be out of the job unfortunately. Somebody would put out a fork that changes the mining algorithm (doesn't even need to be core devs), returning it back to CPU, everyone and their grandma all around the world would realize they could now start making money with their computer, and the mining power would quickly grow such that the cost == the current market cap of btc. The network would be down for a day or two at the most.
@_date: 2016-10-16 23:38:37
Until recently, there was only one choice. Bitcoin is now maturing to the point that their are multiple implementations and a large and growing chunk of the network is now beginning to take those choices seriously.

1 CPU 1 Vote still works in a pooled environment and would be the only way to guarantee that a person with only 1 CPU even got any reward/vote at all. Yes, that statement has evolved from 1 cpu to 1 gpu to 1 asic but that doesn't have any effect on whether or not Satoshi expected pooling to form.

I like the airbitz going down won't prevent my service. If the service goes down and I lose my phone, is the word seed listed on my account enough to restore my btc?
My issue with airbitz is that, while it's great it is secured by a secure android sandbox, because there is no pc version it's very difficult to transfer an online address sent you on your pc to the phone for payment. Any suggestions? I wish you'd incorporate an address book as well.

No, I just think Back is trying to take WAY too much credit for Bitcoin, especially with his twitter bio (bitcoin is just hashcash with extended inflation control). That fact is simply untrue, bitcoin is SO much more then that. Credit where credit is due but hashcash IS NOT the main innovation of Bitcoin. Adam does not deserve even close to that kind of  credit for Bitcoin, and to continuing citing him as such is extremely dishonest.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:59:33
That's not true. Even today if you only had enough equipment to mine 0.1 btc/day, you could do that with a pool. Without a pool, it would take you on average 175 days to find one block. And if you don't find it early on, and your competition has already deployed more powerful equipment in the meantime - your chance of finding even that block goes down significantly - making it possible that your equipment never mines a single block and you go broke. This would make individual mining far too risky - requiring big players only. Pools spread the risk far more evenly across a broader set of participants.

Few questions:
When using airbitz if the service goes down for any reason do I lose access to my funds?
How do I back up this 2 factor code in the event I lose my phone. It seems anything I can think of, ie. taking a screenshot of the code is very insecure. Am I supposed to assume if I lose access to my phone for any reason my funds are locked for 7 days?
How does the 2factor auth actually work. Is there any way somebody could get my password, and then hack the service to obtain my 2 factor code and activate it on another device?

Wow... You are comparing the most exciting project in all of crypto today with a mining pool??  Supernet is an extremely innovative new project that will bring all of the crypto space to the next level. And InstantDex is set to be the first decentralized crypto to crypto exchange... an important feature of supernet. 418 people in the slack now, from all corners of crypto working together under the Unity umbrella. You've got some serious research to do my friend. Pm me if you'd like an invite to the extremely active slack group.

Has nothing to do with ASICs. People would have just laid out farms of CPU's, advanced cooling systems, special power systems etc.. and we'd be in a similiar situation where people need a specialized setup to compete, and without a pool small miners blocks would be few and far between, with a high risk of losing your entire investment. This implied risk would lead to less miners and lower bitcoin security. I highly doubt Satoshi expected small miners to be like that. Pools make more sense and it wouldn't surprise me to hear he knew that already.

Given that I don't need to trsut them, since they can't do anything to my money without a private key, any amount. Obviously I'd want to verify a super large payment with a second or third party block explorer, but I don't need to run a full node to do that.

What happens if the ninki service goes down for a short time? Will I lose access to my money during that time? I wouldn't want to have to pull out my third key for a short outage.
Also please take a look at how AirBitz is handling two factor auth. Rather then having to enter a stupid 6 digit key everytime, they instead force you to pair each device once with a code only accessible on your mobile app. This is much more user friendly with the same level of security.
I have a problem using this service however... I created an account a while back to test it out, never added any money to it. But now I have forget my password so I cannot log in. If I try to make a new account, it tells me my email address is already in use. How do I solve this?
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:55:06
I highly doubt Satoshi did not forsee mining pools. Can you imagine if mining was just finding a whole block on your own or not? People would have to be mining for years just for the chance to hit one block. By then their equipment would be out of date with a high chance of getting 0 blocks. This would have a much more centralizing effect since the only miners that could mine are those big enough to find at least a block a day. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 12:24:11

A trusted central party does not need to act as a ledger in POS. No idea where you are getting that from. But yes, bitcoin does not rely weak subjectivity and only in rare cases does POS(disregarding trusting your client download source, that pools won't collude, the bitcoin core devs). For majority of cases POS will create a very workable system. But I agree, Bitcoin is slightly better in this respect and that is why I think it isn't going anywhere as the "reserve" crypto or will be replaced by any POS system. That does not mean that such system do not have their [very powerful] use cases.

Just like Bitcoin could never work because 51% attack, regulation, security, criminal use etc etc. Yet in the end it is proving all the naysayers wrong. What has shown to be impossible in theory has been proven to be "good enough" in practice and given some of the advantages pos has over pow the same could be proven again.
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:30:37
I'm not even talking about currency applications. If you were to take a look at what the supernet project is doing with nxt you would see that there are far more possibilities afoot then just simple money, and these features would not work with a pow blockchain. Each piece has its role to play and to just dismiss them outright is no different then all the people that dismiss Bitcoin still today.

Virtex is currently having a huge fire sale due to them removing their shares from an exchange in preparation of future third party investment or maybe even being bought out.

XRP is not a currency, it is a mechanism to curb abuse of the system. Those who are attempting to trade XRP as a currency don't understand Ripple's use case and will be very disappointed when they find their massive amount of XRP to be relatively worthless.
I own a lot of btc and I would really like to see Ripple take off as it will not compete with Bitcoin, it will support it.

Buy some HIM shares at havelockinvestments.com instead. They have 28 mini singles @ 1.6 TH, dating to the first week of availability. (They ordered on 2nd day of preorders) If you look at the share price over time you will see their dividend and share price is due for a huge jump. (Don't get confused by the huge drop which was actually a 10:1 split) Basically an easy way to buy yourself to the front of the line and not have to worry about managing the hardware yourself. This is easily the most well run fund I've seen or been a part of and I've got just about all the coins I own invested in there, just waiting for that shipment:D

I am wondering if we're in the beginnings of a bit of a governmental buying war. What if the Chinese government became a little worried that the US was able to seize so many coins for themselves and decided that they didn't want to be left out of the loop so they bought up a ton of coins, rising the price to where it is today. What if then this begins a bit of a dominos effect for other governments who start to freak out thinking that they may be missing an very important boat? This alone could cause some dramatic price increases at any time, if not has already.

Ripple will be great for acting as a decentralized exchange. XRP will NOT be valuable however. It is nothing more then a spam filter.

I just had a thought watching this video... I wonder if OT or a similiar system will make it possible to avoid the btc valatility by doing something similar to what inputs.io did by allowing you to lock in your btc at $200. GIving up any upswings or down swings by constantly keeping your bitcoin balance at = $200. This would give the people the option to use btc and avoid the volatility problems, while giving up possible gains to another party. I think something will be possible here one day, if it could be done in a sort of trust free way.

Block size staying the same causes a competition for block space, which leads to people paying more fees to get their transactions confirmed more quickly. This will help to keep the mining reward substantial enough when the block reward drops.

Haha I believe it was that very post that got me so worried. Anything could happen, especially if mining does get centralized into more data centres. Some kind of a natural disaster could (and eventually WILL) destroy one of these data centres. When that happens the network would be fucked. 
The problem with allowing the difficulty to lower more quickly would be that people would try and game the system by turning off their power and when the difficulty lowers turning it back on and then mining coins faster.
Perhaps we need some sort of throttle where yes the difficulty can lower more quickly BUT if it lowers in this way then it should begin to automatically increase in difficulty in real time, up to the point it initially fell from.
Or another solution (yours) is a sort of emergency voting system where when a majority of nodes agree there is an emergency and a set of conditions have been met a vote can be had to lower the difficulty. 
Either way, we really need to start thinking about this NOW.

I have met Joseph and the team personally at a Summit here in Toronto and I can assure you they are doing absolutely everything they can to keep the business afloat and to not be destroyed by the Canadian banking system.

Anyone with half a brain would once they did some research. Not only would I get 5% off but most of Bitcoins life shows that if you buy and hold their value will go up so I am also getting off whatever the value of my coins increase by.

Given his confidence level here: 
I would have just assumed he was taking the necessary precautions.

But what do I know lol.

I would certainly think so. The ROI would be sitting at 20%... I wish I had more coins on there when somebody placed 10 units for .75. Pretty sure it's a manipulator trying to lower the price further, would have loved to have messed him up.

The HIM fund @ havelockinvestments.com. They are literally in on second day of preorders with 1.8 TH ordered from BFL. (28 singles)While it's a little risky considering it's dependence on BFL, if you believe BFL are going to ship then HIM is set to up it's hashing power by over 72x very early in the BFL game, which I think will prove to jump the shares a very good amount. They also just set up some very professionally done asicminer blades visible here:  The people running this fund really know what they are doing!

@_date: 2013-07-16 16:08:04
Yeah I agree, not only is this a bad number to use but we should be actively discouraging people from using that client. It provides nothing but a horrible experience compared to the other wallets. I recently tried to sell coins to someone on localbitcoins and this was the client he brought in with his laptop. I had to show him BlockChain because that client leaves a bad taste in your mouth and is very misleading as to what bitcoin is.

Wow I buy and sell like crazy. How they hell am I supposed to calculate that on each partial sale. I don't even know "which" coins were sold.

@_date: 2013-11-17 21:20:02
So you are still paying a 1% fee plus currency conversion rates? Doesn't seem like your saving a ton. I think you also need to realize that part of the reason virtex's prices are a but higher are because gst is baked into the price. It kinda sucks but as Canadians that is what we have to deal with in all of our purchases. Given the price rise of btc I don't feel that extra amount really hurts given that it is keeping our only exchange in the good books with Canadian government. 
@_date: 2013-08-24 22:39:45
When I sell my investment I should get the same or more of the amount I originally invested so I would still gain on the exchange increase. Only investments that accept bitcoin but are converted to fiat would have this problem. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:27:17
I didn't necessarily mean "tutorial". What I meant is, for someone who is new to programming Bitcoin there are a lot of potential unknowns when it comes to doing everything the most 100% secure way. I am aware of proper security practices and I have a lot of Bitcoin knowledge from things I've read online but the thing is, you don't know what you don't know. With all these services getting hacked there clearly is a knowledge gap out there and there doesn't appear to be any proper resources for getting people on the right track. There are plenty of security practices and ways of doing things that are unique to the Bitcoin space and just by having knowledge of computer security does not mean you aren't overlooking something important in Bitcoin security. 
For example, things like setting up HD Bip32 addresses may not be common knowledge but would be an excellent thing to know about when starting a service. Proper set up using 2 of 3 multisig would be another one.
People are learning new ways to both protect and attack these services every day and I think a common resource of best practices would be vital towards helping to thwart these attacks which hurt the entire community.
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:13:16

How would the server properly sign these transactions? The only way I've known to do this so far is to use Bitcoind. I'm guessing there are ways to code signed transactions and broadcast them manually? I'm really still just learning how the whole system works under the covers and Bitcoind has been my only window into that that world so far. 
Right now this is just a hobby thing as I try to learn the ropes. I am hoping to maybe build a start up one day but I clearly need to learn more first.

Are fake poker chips that you can buy in a wal mart not considered a commodity then? They have monetary value after all... How are they any different than buying some "bitcoin chips" to play with? It seems like it is very difficult to draw the line. Unless playing for chips is also technically illegal? Then there is the small issue that poker is actually a game of skill and not really gambling... Not sure how Canada stands on that.

Yes, one using a third party service and another would be my own private server in the case one goes down.
This would also make using a wallet service like blockchain.info infinitely more secure, providing your signing service is separate from blockchain.info itself. Even if blockchain was compromised or gone rogue it would not be able to spend your coins. If your third party service went rogue it wouldn't be able to spend your coins either. This would open up online wallets, which are extremely convenient but unsecure, to be faaar more secure.

While I share your sentiment, in all honesty it is a posting about the Bitcoin Bridge. I'd also like to see Open Transactions destroy Ripple but really, as long as we have options for a p2p decentralized way of trading bitcoins, I'll be pleased.
@_date: 2013-08-14 18:57:31
Really?? I would guess that if I chose a bunch of dictionary words like,
Dog Cat Barn Person
it would be much hard harder to find something like 
Dog Cat Ba!!rn Person
Now you can no longer just search against dictionary words and the number of patterns possible have increased dramatically. You don't know which special chars were used, how many times they were used and where they were used, or if any were even used at all.

No, and nothing will happen until most people are considering this, which they aren't even close. Not until bitcoin's life is threatened would anything such as this gain enough support to occur.

Sept. 26, 2013, 3:52 p.m. - Recent Fraud Attempts require us to tighten our verification procedures yet again!
From CEO Joseph David: "I grow increasingly frustrated with the amount of fraud BTC attracts. My mission has always been to keep Canadian funds in Canadian Banks and service Canadian Citizens only. Every time even one fraud attempt occurs, it damages our relationships with our banks and payment providers and makes it more difficult for all Canadian Bitcoin exchange to operate. As a result of recent fraud attempts, I am drastically increasing our verification requirements and all verified customers will be contacted to update their documentation if needed. Please see the new document requirements on the account verification page and upload any documents that you may be missing. The limits on Bill Payment will now be a maximum of $9,000 per day with $90,000 per 30 day period. Be warned that if you attempt to exceed $30,000 per 30 day period via any payment method we will require a bank reference letter before crediting any received payments. If you would like to make larger deposits, you must be cash verified and use the wire transfer option. We have also implemented velocity controls on new accounts and will be holding all deposits of $5,000 or more via any method for 3 business days AFTER we receive the funds before we can credit your account. I understand that these new policies are frustrating for new and existing users however my goal is to maintain Bitcoin Exchange in Canada with Canadian banks."

Ability to open the file and scan a QR with my phone to sweep the funds is quite useful.

@_date: 2013-08-20 17:57:04
Well it is sort of a big deal. This is now two serious vulnerabilities in two widely used platforms that easily allowed attackers to completely sidestep any security settings and remove coins from addresses. What other vulnerabilities could pop up next?
@_date: 2013-09-05 15:22:02
Wow apparently both of these happened in 2013!
@_date: 2013-08-28 03:24:27
Wow the first bit of that story sounds so familiar...
@_date: 2013-09-03 13:10:32
Virtex is also supposed to have a sales team dedicated to calling Canadian businesses and getting then on board and using their new merchant Api. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 13:32:01
sure, but a list of QR code makes it really easy to open the file and then sweep the contents of one address with a smart phone.

@_date: 2013-05-31 01:38:16
I don't 100% understand how it works, for it is extremely complicated. But I do have a grasp of the problem it is trying to solve and from what I can tell so far it appears to be doing so very well, in a way the bitcoin community would respect and back. I ask the question because I would like to know if coinsetter is aware of it and I would be interested if he had any information as to how this product would still be successful and what it would offer if OT was to gain a significant foothold.
@_date: 2013-08-23 04:10:52
Not totally true, as long as somebody doesn't try and spend the same coins on both of the networks the two chains would meet up and sync together.

Well Havelock is Canadian, which has been so far taking an excellent stance towards Bitcoin regulation, for whatever that's worth.
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:14:08
I've had the same problem, Virtex is aware. For now I've opened up a bmo account. This is the second time td has pulled this shit so it may be the time to switch for good. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:47:04
Here is something that may help, I made a post on their forums and here was their response:
I have spoken to you on the phone and met you in person. I understand you are concerned, but rest assured, Virtex is doing extremely well. In fact, we have a substantial blacklog of people who want to get verified and begin trading. Yes, the verification process is not quick and easy, but this is the reality of operating a Bitcoin exchange in Canada. We need to be diligent in order to maintain our relationships with banks and processors, not to mention keep traders protected from fraud.
The enormous demand to become verified is a testament to the level of trust people have in what is the largest and oldest Bitcoin exchange in Canada. 
In terms of communications, we could dedicate time and money and hire staff to constantly communicate with people on posting forums, but would this really be good use of capital when we have people waiting to get verified, when we have our development team working on a shorting platform and bringing Litecoin trading to the exchange, when we have sales force working to bring in new merchants and build out our merchant API shopping cart, when we are trying to forge mutually beneficial relationships with new Bitcoin startups, when we are trying hard to open up new deposit methods, when we are trying to beef up our exchange software and eliminate bugs so that we minimize down time, etc., etc.?
Based on our current resources, we try our best to communicate through social media outlets like Twitter and Facebook. We will also engage in posting forum discussions and respond to comments and questions where warranted. That said, we will not get lured into shouting matches.
As for the look of the website, that is a matter of opinion. Granted, it might not feature a lot of the design elements that are currently in vogue, however, there are many who like it. There are plenty of other sites that don't follow the latest design trends (craigslist, reddit, kijiji, ebay, etc.), yet they're not hurting for users either. 
On the flipside, I can guarantee you, if we were to "overhaul" the site as you suggest, posting forums would light up with complaints and criticisms. I've been down this road many times. 
All that said, we certainly have discussed giving the site a minor face lift, however, it's simply a lower priority at the moment. There are simply so many other things that we're working on that will have a direct impact on growing revenue.
As a shareholder, I can assure you that everyone is "stepping up to the plate" and working flat-out to build Virtex. Like you, we too have a vested interest in the company and we are all in this for the long haul. 
I realize that in the Internet age we're used to things happening in hyper speed, but keep in mind Virtex is less than three years old. We are still in the early stages of growth. With that in mind, as an investor, you might want to try taking a longer view.
I believe you have my phone number. You are welcome to give me call if you would really like to discuss things further.
@_date: 2013-08-28 16:37:35
Well they are certainly poor now!

@_date: 2013-09-23 12:22:13
Why not just sell the site to someone else who's willing to run it instead?
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:47:50
And while it is coming from a for profit company, all of OT will be 100% open source and in the spirit of bitcoin. They will make their money by building services that use the underlying framework, of course using the fact that they have much more of an early understanding of it then anyone else to their advantage. I fully agree with this business model.
@_date: 2013-10-27 15:59:01
This is depressing.

Pretty sure LocalBitcoins charged you a 1% fee.
@_date: 2013-08-16 16:28:18
The idea of a large amount of computing power going offline seems like much more of a weak point for Bitcoin then a 51% attack. Why aren't there more discussion on how this could be resolved if it were to happen? It seems like it would take a very long time to correct itself if this were to happen and if Bitcoin was a large economy then it would have extremely detrimental effects with no resolution in sight.
@_date: 2013-08-14 15:22:37

It will be an interesting experiment to see how quickly a useful new feature can get consensus. Perhaps if an extra fee was paid to miners by users who wish to have their zerocoin transactions process and promote miners to adopt the feature it would help.

Is it Virtex's goal to become the BitPay of Canada with this system?

No, in fact they should rise quite a bit shortly when their merchant api partnership is released this month and abilty to short shortly thereafter.

I had the same issue occur with Liberty Bit actually. I managed to receive an extra 9 coins. They pleaded with me to return them due to them being a small company on tight margins and offered to allow me to keep one of them. So I did the right thing and sent them back.
@_date: 2013-06-06 00:33:36
So wait, if USD or anything else like gold can be traded that simply using this system, then why will we even need bitcoin anymore?
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:18:30
I can understand that for virtex but not for HIM... the payout for it is in % so as the price in btc goes up so does your payout... HIM is set to obtain bfl Asics in week 1 so I'd expect that payment to go up even more. 
@_date: 2013-08-20 17:53:16
Yeah, quite nice of them but for a free service to be able to do that is very surprising. I guess they do make some money from their mixer "send shared" feature. Either way, pretty awesome of them!
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:04:26
So what do you have to say about everything Virtex says about running a Canadian exchange and pleasing the banks being so difficult? What exactly are you going to be doing differently then them and not fall into the same pitfalls that libertybit had?
@_date: 2013-07-14 19:26:51
How do these work? Can malware just install itself onto your machine through a website? Would it require a flaw in your web browser to do that? Wouldn't it need to request admin priviliges or pop up some kind of warning that something is executing? Scary stuff... Stuxnet/NSA spying who knows what things we could be picking up on our PC's.
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:12:42
I think you need to keep in mind the fact that a company that's sole business is so deeply ingrained in the btc economy will grow along with the btc market itself. There may be a time lag here as the exchange rate is moving up very fast so if you are looking to sell your btc at the top of the bubble but if you look Virtex's volume it has actually increased, along with the fact that the price has more then quadrupled recently. Which means they are raking in at least 5x the amount in fees as they were previously. I would also expect that with the heavy first mover advantage they have, giving them higher and higher volume all the time, this would attract new customers at an almost exponential rate as the btc market continues to attract more buyers. They have already mentioned that they have a huge influx of people waiting to get verified. Then, next time btc crashes, not only does volume spike very high(more fees) but the price tends to crash further then it should, which would in turn actually spike the share price. Longer time, if virtex continues on this track and is able to use their relatively high volume in Canada to attract more Canadians, as well as get signed on with more merchants and more atms... there is potential these shares could actually go to the moon! haha:P
I bought since IPO, and while I certainly wish I had waited until now instead, I really didn't expect such a bubble so quickly. But I have no intention to sell now since all that does was give them free money to invest in their company and then getting out at a loss before they fully realize the fruits of that investment would be a complete waste of my time and money. I think this needs to be looked at as a more long term stock but I feel virtex will post some solid numbers on their Q4 financial report.
Now is an excellent time to buy.
@_date: 2013-09-18 18:36:39
