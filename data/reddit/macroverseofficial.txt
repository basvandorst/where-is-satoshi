GDAX, which is attached to Coinbase, is a regular exchange with effectively instant trades. But you have to actually deposit your money with them for that to work.

If you sell at the bottom of a fake crash you lose everything too. Potentially more than you would if you just waited and sold at human speed.
If you have so much in BTC that losing everything would be a real problem you should sell *right now* and not wait for a crash.

You can try. You will still have to share your real identity with the exchange, though, so I can't see how you get much anonymity out of it. Are you hiding from your ISP?

Poloniex, contrary to appearances, doesn't actually deal in US dollars. They use "USDT", which are USD-backed "Tether" tokens that are transferrable on the Bitcoin blockchain.
So when computing capital gains you will need to account for the market price of USDT when you got it and when you traded it for other things; it can trade at a slight premium or discount.
You also probably want to pull your BTC out and sell on another exchange, rather than trying to convert USDT to USD, as I don't think many places have that particular trading pair.

The IRS is going to have to spend more than $88k to put together a really good sale-vs-transfer guesser. And even then, they won't be right all the time. They're still going to have to go to people and say "we think you sold these BTC that you didn't report" and have some way of reaching a real conclusion as to whether a sale occurred or not.

I think it would just be a soft fork. Reject all normal transactions.
But I'm not sure *every* transaction can be a segwit transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:17:14
That data is all in the blockchain (at least for addresses that ever received incoming transactions). The hard part is actually accessing it.
If just looking stuff up on a blockchain explorer isn't sufficient for your use case, set up a bitcoind-based full node and write a program to talk to its RPC interface, which might expose what you need in an automated fashion.

Basically, the defense is that if an attacker buys up all the Bitcoin, everyone who was using it gets rich. Then they set up an altcoins and make the attacker do it again.
Eventually the attacker runs out of money, or the defenders get so rich that they haven't been meaningfully harmed by the attack.

I like how they note that the biggest obstacle to shorting GBTC is finding any GBTC shares to borrow to short it.
GBTC's high price IMHO is due to the irrational absence of a more functional normal BTC-backed ETF that coins can freely move in and out of. Its premium probably will stick around until such a vehicle appears (and I'm not sure the futures count).

You can also have the developers of your chosen wallet to blame. A bunch of wallet software still hasn't gotten around to it yet. Electrum only added it last month and not everyone will be up to date.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:35:39
One way to try and value BTC that I found interesting was to look at it as a claim on block chain real estate. BTC lets you post transactions and other data to the chain and pay miners to timestamp them with large amounts of hashing power. A timestamping service probably has nonzero value.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:04:46
It's very famous. But its owner, Roger Ver, is extremely unpopular 'round these parts.
But it will still *probably* give you BTC if you ask for BTC. And even if you managed to get BCH you could turn around and trade it for BTC on a distributed exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:23:38
Iota doesn't have block size problems, but it does have epistemological problems. With no global consensus, how do you know a payment you received is really in the main tangle? How do you know nobody can game the most popular tip selection algorithms?
Plus, how do you listen to payments to you (or double spends) if the tangle grows to a several GB/s torrent of data?
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:14:00
I think it's going to be rather like purse.io; it's possible for 3rd parties to use Coinbase for auth and send and receive transactions within Coinbase. So basically instead of getting paid in BTC you get paid in Coinbase BTC deposits.
I don't know how open that platform is, but these people seem to think that they are going to be able to get in.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:18:23
To be fair, this is basically what BCH is *for*. Plus adding more currencies to Bitpay will maybe take some load off the BTC chain.

The Monero devs have designed their system specifically to keep transfer information private. They don't actually know who sent what where.

It would be the same as their fee, if any, to withdraw to a wallet. You would just send a Bitcoin transaction from Bitstamp to your deposit address at the other exchange; there's no dedicated way to move funds between exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:05:55
Not if we're also doing LN. Paying $3 is probably fine for opening or closing a channel, while $50 would probably be too much.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:23:14
I think people want to wait for LN to roll out. If LN is in widespread use and opening and closing channels is completely uneconomical and slow, there might be a lot of support. Right now people are worried that it would sap the crisis energy needed to get LN deployed.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:03:53
I recommend that you put together a setup that you personally are satisfied with the security of, with an understanding and acceptance of the classes of attacks that it cannot protect you against.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:34:20
Are you sending to/from a Segwit address? That can cut fees by a bit.
But in general no, there's no way to send BTC from one address to another at the moment without paying a high fee. You can send the transaction with a lower fee and hope it eventually gets picked up, but that would still probably require a fee that's higher than is really reasonable in this case.
If you just want to test things, consider using the Bitcoin testnet. Coins over there have no value, so transactions are effectively free.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:32:26
The node software doesn't always cope well with a large mempool. But there's no reason a node can't just drop lowest-fee transactions from its mempool if it needs the space, and pick them back up from another node if/when they get mined or mempool conditions change.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:07:52
Maybe. We're not going to fill the SHA256 space any time soon, but it's possible that Satoshi had an amazing cryptanalytic attack on SHA256 that could only be executed by computing a lot of things that hash to hashes with many leading zeros (or by getting SHA256 ASICs manufactured), and inventing Bitcoin seemed like the easiest way to make that happen.

Power grids are overwhelmed with spikes in demand, like AC units powering up all at once when it gets hot. Bitcoin mining draws power 24/7 and so should be an easier-to-manage load.
I definitely am worried about the excessively high energy usage, though. Fossil fuel energy is artificially cheap, and BTC encourages the economy to use as much of it as possible. We have way more miners than we really need.

I've looked at the closed issues, and most of them look like people complaining about things that are not Bitpay/Copay's problem. A large portion if the issues are complaints that BTC network fees are high, or that the fees are too high to move small amounts of money. Other issues include people not having received payments they were expecting but which weren't actually sent out on the chain, and people losing their recovery phrases. None of that is anything the Copay developers can fix correctly.
Also, most of those issues are terrible posts according to GitHub social norms. I'm unsurprised that many are being closed without meaningful comment, although it does suggest that the devs are being somewhat overly brusque.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:39:28
This is going to be Mycelium's fault, probably. Coinbase can't do anything about people not paying a high enough fee when sending to them (except spending their own money to CPFP it).
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:56:08
Basically, you spend the change from the stick transaction in a transaction that pays double the normal fee. Miners will pick up the "parent" stuck transaction so that they can also take the "child" change-spending transaction and collect its larger fee.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:37:57
It used to be that this would happen if someone handcrafted a transaction and did it wrong. Any leftover money from the inputs that doesn't go to an output becomes the fee, so it was easy to forget to account for all of it and pay a super high fee.
Now I suspect it is likely to be the result of someone adjusting their wallet's fee settings, without really thinking through the consequences or checking the wallet's work.

Be careful, then: running everything over Tor can easily have the opposite effect. Some Tor exit nodes maliciously alter the traffic passing through them, by, for example, appending viruses to any executable files you download. Make sure that absolutely all traffic you route through Tor is encrypted all the way through to the ultimate destination, and be especially suspicious of self-signed certificates.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:39:24
They won't. But that doesn't mean the nodes won't be seen as doing "money transmission" or something similar by some regulator somewhere.

On an exchange, you don't have to deal with sketchy people (who might up and tell you they are going to spend their BTC on drugs, in which case you can't sell to them) and "counterparty risk" in general. And banks scrutinize it more and might get spooked and close your account. But on LocalBitcoin you might be able to charge a premium.

They're probably pulling data from Equifax or someone, who in turn just has a big list of People Who Are Real who they maintain according to their own arbitrary process.
The list isn't going to include everyone, since they build it by trawling through home ownership records and car registration records and bank customer lists and whatever else, and there's no real good way to get on the list or hold the company that maintains it responsible for the problems you encounter for not being on it.

The IRS hasn't really gotten around to interpreting anything AFAIK.
It will be interesting to see how they actually intend to audit crypto transactions and tell sales from transfers in practice. The only way I can see them doing it is demanding signed attestations from addresses to prove that you control them. But then that raises free speech and lost password concerns, as well as causing trouble with addresses that correspond to scripts.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:41:36
But coins that are sent to a BTC address can also be sales, if you are e.g. paying for something straight from the Coinbase wallet. Or you can do a transfer to yourself now and send some to someone else later.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:44:17
You got a bunch of small transactions coming in, and you need to pay for a signature releasing the funds for each input transaction you are using.
Basically you're signing over checks totaling 0.3 BTC, and you have to pay transaction fees by the check.
I'm not sure how you can avoid this problem. You could try sending with a lower-than-recommended fee and waiting a long time for some unused block space to crop up. But that might take a very long time and there are still minimum fees per byte.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:38:02
Well clearly it sucks if the wallet is thinking it made a transaction and the network can't see it. But you haven't lost $3k (unless you mean in terms of lost trading profits or something); your coins are only stuck until Copay fixes whatever is wrong with their wallet or until you ditch Copay for a more functional app.
If your coins are in a single-signature wallet, you can just restore your seed on any other HD wallet app and send from there. If you're using multisig, switching away might be tougher, but it's still something you should be able to do.
EDIT: To clarify, the blockchain is always right about whether the funds have moved or not, but your wallet can wrongly think the funds have been sent when they haven't, and show you an incorrect, lower balance. (You can also have similar things on the other end with unconfirmed received transactions.) This is supposed to improve usability by showing that you sent/received money right away, before it confirms, but it can sometimes get stuck in weird out-of-sync states.

It's certainly possible to try and hope. But if you calculate out the probability of actually getting a block, it's pretty safe to say you won't get a block. Compare it to, say, the probability of your computer catching fire and burning down your house.
Maybe you can hook up your miner to a quantum RNG to at least guarantee that in some universe you find a block.

The real problem is the potential cost of opening and closing channels. LN is designed around the idea that, while it's worthwhile to save on-chain fees by doing transactions off-chain, it's no big deal to have to tear down a channel and open a new one.
If BTC goes up by 10x or 100x or whatever absurd figure people are hoping for, so does the price to open a channel. If it costs $100 or $1000 to even start transacting, and if the other end of the channel can force you to pay that fee again at will, LN looks much less amazing.

They'd be wrong if they were Bitcoin, but as alts they may be right. Altcoins space will always be cheaper because there are so many competing alts to choose from.

I don't have a good citation for that, but I do recall come complaints about people running out of RAM a couple of months ago. I don't think I can dig them up now.
I think the gist of it was that people were running bitcoind on tiny computers with its default max mempool size, and that default happened to be larger than the RAM they allocated to their node. So as soon as the mempool filled up, bitcoind would run out of memory because its internal limit was higher than the physical limits of the system it was on.

The IRS can't tell a transfer from a sale without fancy blockchain analysis that they don't have the resources to do. They need to make you tell them which is which. I have no idea how they plan to effectively audit you if they think you are lying.
The Coinbase tax reports are mostly useless; they can't tell what a sale is either but they pretend they can.

I think what you want is CPFP (child pays for parent), not RBF, because you are the receiver of the transaction and not the sender. Basically you spend the unconfirmed coins to yourself, with a fee high enough to cover both transactions. I don't know if Copay supports this, but if it does you should be able to look up how to do it.

Maybe the admins can do something. But that's not the sort of problem they have precedent for dealing with.
was started amid concerns about overzealous moderation on and tended to attract people who wanted Bitcoin to go in a different direction than the main Bitcoin development team. So when BCH forked off to actually head in that direction, most people over there jumped onto it. Hence the weird situation we have now.

I think you need to sit back and think about your threat model. What are you trying to prevent, exactly? There's not really any such thing as "more secure" or "less secure", except in so far as some security measures protect against more potential attacks than others do. You need to trade off the level of protection from particular threats you think are credible against the cost of the security measure (and the likelihood that you will just get tired of it or forget and not use it like you should).
For example, booting off of a USB stick that you keep with you might protect you from people who sneak into your house and try and read your computer's hard drive. But so would encrypting the hard drive, and it's probably easier to remember a password than to carry a USB stick with you wherever you go and hope that nobody steals it.
Moreover, if you are booting the USB stick in a VM, a sufficiently clever attacker who has compromised the host computer (or, realistically, any off-the-shelf keylogger) will also be able to see anything that happens inside the VM. So using a VM is really only a useful protection against automated attacks that aren't clever enough to see inside the VM.

Do you know who had the laptop before you? Is it possible that the laptop is bugged by an intelligence agency bent on stealing your coins? Do you necessarily trust Google not to deploy software designed to steal your money in the guise of a ChromeOS update? Would you be able to tell if a nefarious party replaced the laptop with a similar-looking one and captured your password when you went to log into it? What if your device contracted malware that exploited a security hole in ChromeOS? What if an extension you install in your browser becomes compromised and replaces all cryptocurrency addresses in pages you visit with those of an attacker?
It's impossible to say that a particular setup is "secure" in general, but these are some of the things that the setup you are considering might not protect you against. That being said, your proposed setup still might be the right choice for you, given the relatively low likelihoods of most of the attacks outlined above, and the costs of alternative setups.

I think it's closest to the "one bunch" scenario. Valid transactions waiting to be mined are flooded from node to node through the network, and are stored in each node's "mempool". Generally miners will pack their blocks with the most lucrative, high-fee transactions currently in the mempool, although different miners have different rules for what they in particular will include. But it's not uncommon for a transaction to be included in most or all of the blocks that miners are currently hashing on. It's just that as soon as one miners finds a valid solution and broadcasts their finished block, the other miners will drop the transactions that that new block included from their blocks.

The ATH is now something like $3300 that it's hitting, which is not a nice round number. $3000 was exciting, maybe $4000 or $3500 would be exciting, but $3300 isn't.
Plus there's not much of a story. The BCC drama is hard to explain, already got a bunch of press, and is not really clearly connectable to the price shenanigans today. Looking at the charts, it looks like a sudden unexplained panic buy moved the market, and "BTC crosses $3300 for no apparent reason" is a terrible story.

You might have some luck throwing your old GPUs at cryptocurrencies that are commonly mined on GPUs (like Ethereum, for example). There are mining clients you can get that will automatically point your cards at whatever crypto is currently most profitable, and you can have payment for your hash power delivered to you in BTC. I believe NiceHash is one such service, and I think they have their own client software.
Mining on Bitcoin itself with GPUs is sadly no longer competitive.

The abstraction of "the community", not any particular people. People were excited when BIP91 signaling started, and when it activated, and when it basically locked in locking in segwit. The noise level of 2x opposition seemed much lower then, although people were always audible cautioning that they didn't sign anything. Now that segwit is in, I hear a lot more about how bad 2x is, and there seems to be much more coherent opposition to the NYA now that one side of the may-or-may-not-have-been-agreed-to deal has been delivered.
I'm sure it's different people holding each position, but as their relative loudness varies, the community as a whole seems fickle.

I'm not that worried. All the new Tethers very well might be legitimately issued to people who, despite the banking fiasco, managed to get Tether some cash. Although people complain Tether doesn't promise to redeem USDT, I haven't seen much from people complaining that they actually have USDT that they haven't been able to redeem.
Moreover, the market is still trading USDT at about 1:1 with USD. I even saw it at a premium last night on Kraken. Presumably this is because, while it might not be easy to turn into USD, it is easy to send around for low fees, and so people are willing to overlook concerns about how backed it is because of its convenience.
If people (many of whom hate the Fed on principle) are willing to use the Fed's unredeemable IOUs for $1 as money, why shouldn't they be willing to use Tether's more convenient unredeemable IOUs for $1 as money?

Deflation definitely makes BTC less fun. Who's excited to get 0.001 of something?
I think the community doesn't care about deflation too much, maybe because the people who would otherwise be concerned are getting rich off of it. We have yet to see deflation-induced volatility, too, since if it's even there it hides behind the "normal" moon/doom volatility. Maybe when it shows up people will care.
It could also be that people see deflation as a necessary compromise, in order to basically bribe people to adopt the system. A deflationary distributed currency might be better to have than an inflationary centralized one, even if the deflation is a real problem.

The 2x devs (and the core devs for that matter) are AFAIK not certified as anything, and have no fiduciary duty to do what's best for BTC holders (or BTC users, or miners). Not being the one to implement replay protection is an intentional design choice, because it makes a fork with two coexisting chains harder and lends each branch more legitimacy as "the real bitcoin". Whoever caves and implements it loses.
If the 2x fork is genuinely the Right Choice for Bitcoin, as its proponents profess, and will make BTC more valuable, then doing anything that makes it less likely to win outright could be acting against the interests (although perhaps in accordance with the stated preferences) of BTC holders.

Salt is trying to let you do that right now. I don't know whether banks let you use arbitrary assets or interests as collateral.
One problem might be that BTC are more or less explicitly designed to be hard to seize. If you don't pay the loan, how exactly is the bank going to compel you to deliver the collateral? They'd probably have to hold the coins while the loan was out, which they aren't likely to be set up to do.

There are decentralized exchanges (like bisq or some of the Ethereum on-chain token exchanges) where there is no real exchange holding the coins, so the exchange can't get hacked or exit scam you or lock down your account.

I could see "inflation" taking place via the printing of new, theoretically distinct kinds of money that are exchangeable for BTC or each other. But this process is different than the inflation you might get when you just print more of the currency you had before. In particular, you can't do it too fast; you can only generate altcoin market cap so fast, based on the attention of speculators and how much "hard" money they have available. You can maybe get $10k market cap out of InflationCoin, but launching InflationCoin2 and InflationCoin3 at the same time won't get you another $20k.
And if people want to adopt new monies, it might be bad for BTC holders (who would prefer they do work to get ahold of BTC instead), but it's hard to see how it could be bad for the money-adopting society as a whole.

The trouble with payroll on Lightning is that you can't take BTC you got on one channel and send it out of another one. So if you get paid by your employer through a channel with them, you'd have to route outgoing payments back through them if you want to spend that money specifically, or you'd have to close the channel and use the money to open new channels with other people.
It might work better if you got paid through channels you already had. But who's going to open up a channel with enough capacity for their salary?

The mempool is the list of all the unconfirmed transactions that have been broadcast. It's not always identical between different nodes, but nodes will send transactions to one another, and they won't accept new transactions into their mempools that conflict with what's already there.

How is 2x going to orphan blocks? Or is the "attack" that the 1x chain outgrows the 2x chain and, still being valid under the 2x rules, replaces it?
Longest chain wins is an intended feature of the system, and it happening on a large scale is not an attack (as compared to a real "attack" where you use a lot of mining power to pull off a double spend). People trying to double-spend coins on a fork they think will lose might be an attack though.
As for losing money to the lack of replay protection, that can only happen if people don't exercise due care and neglect to split their coins before transacting business after a fork. More responsible than the developers of the software enabling the fork would be the people who refuse to send back coins sent to them on the wrong fork by mistake.

It seemed like segwit2x had a lot of support. There was widespread on-chain signaling by miners for segwit2x in advance of the flag day, and the UASF chain didn't actually have to split off from the main chain I think in part because of that support.
Maybe most users didn't support it and it was just a capitulation by miners to avoid a damaging UASF while still pushing for a block size increase that people didn't generally want. But now that segwit is happening, I'm not personally opposed to a 2x hard fork if the community can be convinced to come along.

The electric costs of mining scale up or down depending on what you are using to mine. If you buy some dedicated Bitcoin mining equipment that draws a few kilowatts, the landlord might notice a large electric bill. If you run one 160 watt GPU 24/7 mining Ethereum, you'll be using electricity, but not dramatically more electricity than a person would be expected to use for a plant-growing light or a space heater or a few old incandescent light bulbs or a LAN party every weekend.
If you really want to set up a big mining operation, renegotiate your lease to pay for your own electricity. If you just happen to do mining with stuff you have already or would reasonably be expected to be able to run in a house, I doubt it will raise any alarm bells.
That being said, free electricity is not really free; someone is generating it and probably dumping carbon into the atmosphere if it's not coming from your solar panel. So think before you mine, because BTC will be worthless in a world where nobody can grow food anymore and there's a hurricane every week.

In general, yes, your coins should live in your wallet.
During a dip, you want your coins *off* the exchange, so you don't panic sell them. If it really is a temporary dip, the best place for the coins is in your wallet not being sold.

The main user-facing effect of segwit is that there are now "segwit addresses", which you can only use if you have a segwit-enabled wallet. Transactions using them are slightly cheaper.

I don't think it's so unlikely (and the sub that shall not be named is more or less certain of it). You need miners and users for a functional cryptocurrency; neither can survive without the other. Each trying to take their ball and go home to their own chain is a recipe for failure.
EDIT: the most likely fork failure mode is the 1x chain having to do a PoW change, leaving no "real" Bitcoin.

So there are two exchanges on Coinbase.
One is Coinbase proper, where they quote you a price and you buy or sell to/from Coinbase at that price.
The other is GDAX, which is a more traditional exchange where you put in orders. I think that's the one you are talking about.
On GDAX you can do limit and market orders. A limit order is basically an ad that you are willing to buy/sell X BTC at Y price. You put in the ad and wait for someone to take the bait.
If you don't want to wait, you can do a market order. Market orders buy/sell X BTC right now at the best price available, but GDAX takes a cut of the transaction as a fee. Basically they respond to the ads and actually cause transactions to happen.
You can't post a limit order too close in price to another limit order; there's a minimum price increment. This prevents people offering 1, 1.9, 1.99, 1.999 etc. indefinitely in a useless game of front running.
You also can't post limit orders that overlap. You can't post an ad to buy at 1.5 if someone already has an ad up to sell at 1.5. If you could, GDAX would have to execute the order, but it promised not to charge either of you a fee, so you could just trade for free, which GDAX doesn't want. (I don't think there's a really good reason why they can't just let the orders overlap, besides that That's Not How Exchanges Work.)
So you can get into a situation where the minimum ask and the maximum bid are exactly the minimum price increment apart, and you can't get an order in in between them. Then you either have to bid/ask a price that already has other orders at it (and wait for them to execute first), or use a market order (and pay a fee) if you want to trade.

There are two main advantages:
1. Bitcoin has more realness. Bitcoin Cash is a fork, while Bitcoin is the original. When looking for a coin people can all agree to value, that matters.
2. Bitcoin is going to get Lightning, which will allow for off-chain payments, which we think will be able to scale to extremely large transaction volumes. Bitcoin Cash can't use Lightning as it's currently designed, and the community seems to not want it anyway, so if Lightning actually turns out to be good that will help Bitcoin and not BCH.
Of course, Bitcoin Cash has some advantages too, like cheaper/faster transactions on-chain.

PayPal is honestly going to be harder to use than physical cash; it's trivially revocable and often used to scam people out of their BTC.

@_date: 2017-11-28 17:47:54
Every limit order is matched by a market order. It won't let you place a limit order that would collide with another limit order on the other side, because then the exchange would have to execute the orders, but it wouldn't be able to charge either side a fee, because GDAX limit orders are free.
So if you actually want your order to execute now, do a market order.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:32:34
This is... maybe not good.
We don't want people "investing" on BTC and other cryptos without at least basic investing skills. They'll get shocked when it doesn't continue 10x-ing each year, panic sell at bottoms, and then complain to their local government that they got scammed by a bunch of nerds on the Internet.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:23:32
There's no legislation specifically, but rights in general can be property, and Bitcoin is more or less a right to move the relevant (virtual) coins on the chain.
If the government is seizing it, they sort of admit it is A) real and B) property. I suppose the defendant here could have run a "Bitcoin is actually not a thing" defense, but it would have to convince a judge.

If your transaction had replace-by-fee (RBF) enabled, and your wallet supports it, you can basically resend it with a higher fee.
If not, you can (depending on the receiving wallet) force your wallet to spend the unconfirmed coins in a transaction with a fee high enough to convince the miners to include both. This is called "child pays for parent".
How to accomplish either of these depends heavily on the wallet software in use on both sides of the stuck transaction.

Coinbase will sell you BTC in a less stock-exchange-like format. It's at a worse rate than a real exchange, but it basically works like a currency exchange at an airport.
You still would have to verify your identity and attach a bank account, though. And you might have to wait around for the transfer of money in to go through.
Notably missing is a buy-and-send-simultaneously feature. You need to buy and then send.
People *will* sell BTC to you instantly with a credit card purchase, but they charge large flat fees on top of a percentage, and they put it through as a cash advance CC transaction which your bank will probably charge you for too. 
You can also maybe find a BTC ATM near you that takes cash.

Fees aren't *entirely* independent of the amount you send. The larger your payment, the more likely it is that you're going to have to combine multiple UTXOs to make up the amount, and so the bigger your transaction is likely to be.

The longest valid chain will definitely win. The Bitcoin system will not be brought down by running 2x without replay protection.
The replay "attack" consists of trying to trick people into accidentally sending their real BTC to the wrong place when attempting to use or sell off 2X coins they have magically been granted. Alternatively, it could be an attempt  to shut down the BTC network, by making people accidentally spend their free 2X coins if they make any normal transactions. Bitcoin itself will run fine no matter what transactions you make, but someone tricking people en masse into making unintentional transactions is still a problem.

The 83% of transactions probably don't *not* want to use segwit. They just can't be arsed to switch.

People are worried because outputs intended to be spent by segwit addresses have associated scripts that, under pre-segwit rules, if segwit were not enforced, would let anyone spend the coins. That's how segwit was engineered to work as a soft fork; it's all still valid under the non-segwit rules, because the outputs get created and then they get redeemed and the old software just sees anyone-can-spend coins getting spent by someone.
It's a bit nerve-wracking for people who like to mess around down in the scripts, because it can feel like filling out a blank check and then attaching a post-it specifying the recipient. But under segwit the post-it is valid and will be respected (and can't be removed). Segwit actually *is* being enforced, miners only take duly authorized segwit transactions spending segwit outputs; the outputs don't say "anyone can spend these coins" under the new rules.

Larger blocks make it harder to run full nodes. If you double the block size you double the rate at which you need to buy hard disks.
That's not to say that this has a particularly large effect on the number of full nodes being run, at least right now, with the 2x increase being proposed. As you say, most people are going to be doing SPV at any block size, and people with full nodes haven't had to buy hard disks particularly fast. But it's a consideration.

It runs on a narrative the same as the 2x community does, except the narrative is about how bad 2x is and how segwit and LN are amazing and will solve everything, and also Roger Ver is evil for some reason.
People don't think these things because they're true, they think them because they've been selected as community beliefs.
I think segwit and LN probably will solve a bunch of our problems, and a fork to 2x block size probably isn't necessary. But I got those opinions from the community, not through any sort of network modeling experiment or any other method that would be really epistemologically sound.

You absolutely *can* have a hostile takeover of Bitcoin if you have the hashrate to do it.

But even if I go around attributing powers to my vote that it doesn't have, how does that justify the state stepping in to stop the actual voting and seize the ballots?

It's not a better currency than all previous currencies. The value swings wildly, only so many people can spend it at a time, and it still costs a lot to send.
We're planning to solve some of these problems soon, though.

I'm assuming 2x miners are organized enough to sustain a DoS attack on 1x despite the common good problem (where no individual attacking miner makes any money by doing it). If they have 85% of all hash power, they can spend 51% of it making the 2x chain longer. Then they still have enough left over to mine a 1x chain consisting of entirely empty blocks that's longer than the legitimate 1x chain (which only has 15%).

Yeah, but you only spend the UTXOs you need to make the payment you are making. Any other payments to the address you are sending from stay at that address.

How? It's an entire architecture. Does Bitcoin Core use hand-optimized x86 assembly somewhere?

You can hedge against the possibility that you're wrong and it doesn't drop.

You would need an account with an exchange in the name of the trust, just like for investing in stocks or commodities.
Unfortunately I think that usually requires a bit more attention from the exchange than setting up a normal account, which might make it hard to do given how swamped exchange support staff have been.
You also might want to talk to a lawyer; is this trust allowed to be invested in super risky investments? What would the beneficiaries say if you wanted to put it all in a diversified portfolio of junk bonds, penny stocks, and timeshares? Would they have recourse to sue if the investment went bad, even if they agreed with it at the time?
You should *not* be doing *anything* with a 6 figure amount "ASAP". Being a trustee is a solemn responsibility, not a chance to throw lots of money around.

I think high fees are a sort of self-limiting problem, and kind of a good problem to have. High fees mean people value  using the system. The more people who give up on Bitcoin because the fees are high, the lower the fees will be. It's like rent in San Francisco: it's absurdly high because people really want to live there, and if it gets too high people will be forced out until it comes down.
It's definitely a significant problem that limits our growth and artificially excludes people from our community, but it's not the sort of problem that can kill the system. The biggest risk is that all the people priced out of Bitcoin switch to another coin and make it better than Bitcoin is. I wish that would happen to San Francisco, but so far it hasn't.
I suppose Core not wanting to increase the block size in order to keep the pressure on people to adopt Lightning is what's happening. Since I favor Lightning adoption, I think it makes sense to do; never waste a crisis and all that. As the people who design the currency, they are in the business of using software to manipulate the community. And although they stand to benefit, it's not like LN is a single company's product; there are several independent open-source implementations around an open set of standards documents.
On the one hand it would make sense to solve the problem for now while we all wait for Lightning to develop, while on the other hand Lightning is going to develop faster if people have a monetary interest in seeing that happen as soon as possible.

You might be driven to care if this is adopted on the 2x chain. Basically, it says that as long as the longest valid 1x chain contains any transactions since the 2x chain forked off, then no 2x blocks are valid.
This is designed to make 2x miners spend at least some of their hash power mining a version of the 1x chain containing nothing but empty blocks. If they devote more hash power than the legitimate 1x miners have, no 1x transactions will go through.

I liked bitcoin-days destroyed too; it seems to have gone away as a thing people care about.
It might also make sense to charge by the output, since outputs and their expenditure are what really get tracked.

Are the long-time hodlers the source of the cash that the miners need to pay their bills?
If 2x is responsive and has the longest chain immediately after the fork, while 1x is under DoS attack, people coming in to "buy Bitcoin" might end up buying 2x coins, either because 2x is trading under the BTC ticker, or because 2x is working at all while BTC isn't.
If most of the diehard 1x supporters never get set up with 2x clients to dump their 2x coins, then all the incoming money goes to the miners. I'm not convinced this won't be profitable.

Segwit is coming along nicely; it will be in the next Electrum, and hopefully from there everyone will start using it. Switching over 17% of the entire Bitcoin economy since August isn't that bad.
I am a bit disappointed in the LN progress, though. It was invented years ago at this point, the specs have been out for a while, there are multiple implementations, and there are even nice packaged apps like Eclair and the GUI for LND. But all of the implementations, despite apparently working, explicitly warn users off of actually *using* them with non-test Bitcoins. Nobody's going to adopt a network where the nice UIs are all locked to testnet and all the software has big don't-use-this warnings on it.

The idea of an "illegal vote" is antithetical to democracy. A vote is just a big opinion poll. There can be no legitimate restrictions on what questions people bring to a vote, only on what is allowed to happen as the result of a vote.

Browser extensions can do element hiding, where they hide parts if the page that are ads even if they were sent as part of the original page. Network devices can only black-hole certain hostnames or IPs, unless you let them read and manipulate your encrypted traffic.

That's always true. If you want to sell or buy *right now*, you can use a market order, but that's just compromising by being willing to sell or buy *at any price* to be able to do it now.

Mining bitcoin itself with a general purpose computer is unfortunately generally not worth doing even with free power, now that dedicated bitcoin mining hardware exists. But consumer GPUs are still very useful for mining other cryptocurrencies.
We can't tell you if your computer in particular would be good at it though, since you didn't post anything about it.
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:32:06
Really it's all about the GPU when mining most things, and generally the AMD cards are better than the nvidia ones. But a near top of the line nvidia card still ought to be useful. Maybe you can look up hash rate info from people with similar cards.
I predict your overall yield will probably be on the order of 10 cents per day. Not very much, but it might add up over time.

If you want to jump the queue you can grab your addresses and plug them into a block explorer, to see if they have current balances or not.

They would show up in the client on the addresses tab, I think. It's been a while since I used the official client.

If you rely on the TREZOR surviving, and you aren't using a password, all you really have to do is have the device know what time it is and automatically unlock after nobody enters a PIN for many years.
Not that that's particularly easy, but it's not impossible. People might be incentivised to steal it, though, and you'd have to make sure to restore your seed and move to a new seed within a few years of any theft.
