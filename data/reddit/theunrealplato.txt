what i want to verify is when my client sees an incoming transaction, signed with the private key, matching the address's public key.  
I need to know if this transaction's inputs actually have any value.  
I do that by looking up these inputs in my blockchain and looking for any transactions that sent money out of them.  
I do get that your point was 'you won't have enough money to make txs' but that's not really a fair dismissal
OT makes transactions AND verification cheap... my concern is that Bitcoin transactions are made so cheap *now*, that *eventually* verification becomes extremely expensive (both in storage and computation)
the counterparty who I pay for verification can lie about the result or refuse to answer me when I ask him to verify

As a Bitcoin and Open Transactions supporter I will use the VPS to host an OT notary service. The job of this server is to provide a third party signature for messages, alongside the signatures of Alice and Bob. Notary servers are an essential component of an Open Transactions ecosystem but I only know of one public notary to date. 
Once there are dozens instead of two notary servers, they can create "multisig pools" where e.g. 17 out of 20 servers have to agree that a user can withdraw his coins... Honest servers verify the user's cryptographic signature and allow the withdrawal. Dishonest servers will have to convince 16 of their 19 peers to conspire to steal the coins. Compare to MtGox, Bitstamp where you put full trust in one server.

Yep, I think that Bitcoin's niche is a high value, high tx value, low tx volume settlement currency. 
I don't think it's worth storing micro and nanopayment transactions  in everyone's blockchain. Also, the tx fees make nanopayments impractical. I want to send a satoshi's worth of value every time I click the Like button.
Such nanopayments are one use case for OpenTransactions; I can give the transaction server an OT asset, valued at 0.1 satoshi, and the content creator  0.9 satoshis worth of the same asset. Neither me, the server, nor the content creator has to waste storage space keeping track of this OT cash.
@_date: 2014-10-08 06:05:51
I didn't know the satoshidice story, that's heartening
btw, my desire for a small blockchain is as an end user who wants to verify his own incoming transactions, not as a miner. As that end user I can't affect block size.
Sure, moores law cheapens storage space, but perhaps transactions increase at a faster rate
I think keeping the limit will drive innovation more than raising the limit, because:  
if you offer an **ok** solution (more blockchain space for transactions,)  
then some fraction of users who *would* innovate and/or adopt **better** solutions, instead take the OK solution
i say raising the limit is socialistic because it's a decision by TODAY'S bitcoin users to burden FUTURE bitcoin users with increased storage costs, when we could instead not do that
My valuation of those future storage costs, loss of monetary sovereignty, and reduced innovation, outweighs my valuation of the benefit of increased transaction volume.

If there are enough $1000+ transactions that pay $10 fees to fill the 1mb limit, then Yes.  
At that point the $5 merchants and customers should be using OT or equivalent for daily transactions; and only settling into or out of BTC when they need to move enough money that the $10 miners' fee is reasonable.

construct a blockchain contract such that a set of known trusted parties multisig escrow an account dedicated to donations for a specific feature.
I would donate to a 3/5 multisig address controlled by [Jon Matonis + Jeff Garzik + Pieter Wielle + Gavin Andressen + Cody Wilson] given that they all promised to only use the money to pay bounties to developers.
I'd set up one address for each thing that needs funding... specify a set of acceptance requirements for, i dunno, "Choose a file, hash it, and attach the hash to a transaction as metadata".
that way you both get additional trust beyond a single trustee; AND the community gets to fund exactly the features they want

i imagine a Bitcoin 2 client would send your coins to yourself peridiocally, so you wouldn't be hassled with having to manually spend coins intermittently.
lotteries would indeed take stupid people's money who didn't use such a client and forgot to send coins before their expiration date. that's the cost you pay to eliminate dead coins
miners could still participate in pools, the mkeys would attribute which miner found it
@_date: 2013-05-16 02:45:06
ha probably. typing out the first draft took just over one hour, i have spent an additional 2 hours maybe with edits, spreading the link, and generating pdf from markdown.
I remember it being quite painful to clean up and apply formatting to an OCR'd document (unless OCR has gotten orders of magnitude better since ~2008 when I last used it?)
@_date: 2013-07-23 17:38:51


not true, savings are great


I think it's a good thing to recycle lost coins and a bad thing to recycle in-use coins; sure this lottery would require users to take action to not let coins expire; sure some prople would fuck it up.
I don't really have an opinion on whether recycling coins is worth the tradeoff of added complexity and tears of people who didn't read the instructions.
@_date: 2013-07-23 20:35:32
this is not my idea, i just found and posted the pdf
the authors suggest that a sliding, fixed size blockchain comes at a cost of complexity but has the benefits of lightweight client blockchains (because they only have to keep the most recent *n* blocks) and a more stable monetary base.
I have a suspicion that validating the signatures the miners make with their mkeys would be prohibitively expensive in Bitcoin 1, especially if block size limit increases. So the sliding blockchain might be necessary for using mkeys to build miner reputation.
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:27:23
i suggest using  for pricing information. They have more strict criteria for which exchanges they count. for example, mtgox is disallowed because they are bad at withdrawals. the gox price is higher than the others because users are pricing in the risk that mtgox fucks up and they can't get their coins out, thus the mtgox price is (users price of bitcoin value + users price of mtgox withdrawal risk)
@_date: 2013-08-08 17:46:33
apparently you can generate the transactions for the keep-alive transactions all in a batch, when you generate the wallet. then you store the transaction data, but *not* the private key, and release the transactions periodically.
@_date: 2013-07-23 16:02:05
It would be too severe a shock to force a major protocol switch instantaneously. 
This instead offers a window of opportunity for up to three years or so, during which time you can turn Bitcoin 1 coins into valid Bitcoin 2 coins that are spendable in Bitcoin 2 blocks.
As described in note 5, the window remains open until the first of  
(block 420000, ~jan 2017, 12.5BTC halving block)  
or  
(the total number of coins in Bitcoin 2 \[1] reaches the number of coins existing in the parallel Bitcoin 1 blockchain at its sister block.)
\[1] i.e. the number of transferred-in coins, plus the number of coins mined in 25 BTC coinbase transctions, in Bitcoin 2 blocks since the Bitcoin 2 genesis block.

noted, i just think that it would not have saved me any time to search for an OCR solution, install it on my linux box, clean any OCR errors, and apply formatting; vs typing the markdown formatting directly :D

Again the cost is basically "Push this button once a year". I have no opinion whether that cost is worth the benefit of a stable monetary pool.

that would simply mean that out of 10 people 1 lost their money. One might have a 100% risk or 0.001% risk depending on their wallet and security setup, this is nothing new. I would be smart about it and have nowhere near a 10% risk of losing my money, even if that was the rate of attrition among the general population.
we obviously both agree that expiring coins is a cost and I am not arguing that it's a better system
@_date: 2013-07-24 19:54:15
Bitcoin 2 is basically an alt-coin; after Bitcoin 2 starts up, Bitcoin 1 will likely remain alive forever. I am agreed that the market shall decide which is better and adjust the usage and value of each protocol accordingly

All reasonable scenarios. As a defense I would update my coins every six months, instead of every year. I would probably also set up a web service where users tell me what addresses to watch, and I contact them if I see an address without transactions for *n* months.

Well, arguably, by participating in such a system you'd be accepting a contract stating "You can lose your money if you screw up." More money would be lost (and I'm not sold on the idea myself) but it is hardly a violation of your property rights since you knew the risks going in.


That's not enough to keep track of your money. First they have to know the initial address that holds the coins. And then after a year, when you send it to yourself, they know you didn't lose the wallet.
But assuming you send it to a fresh address they have no way of knowing you still hold the coins. That could have been a perfectly legitimate payment.


Users would bail en masse to currencies that are specialized for their interests, which would most likely be overlay currencies backed by and redeemable for Bitcoin2, offering various subsets of anonymity, instant settlement, microtransactions etc. 
Bitcoin2 is the hard-to-attack store of value. That is ALL it has to do right to survive and hold value forever.  
*edit - I meant unit of account here. As long as a bitcoin has a value, overlay currencies can hold value and function. As proposed Bitcoin2 is obviously a worse store of value than Bitcoin1 due to expiring coins, assuming all else is equal. The tradeoff as proposed is better resilience and decentralization at the cost of convenience.*


I dunno if you could use thin clients in Bitcoin2. Blockchain sizes would be smaller than Bitcoin1 (because Gavin decided to raise the block size limit.) Bitcoin1 clients already have to store the full blockchain (or talk to a client that does.) 
as I read it Bitcoin2 clients will only have to store blocks in the spendable window, so they can validate incoming transactions and ban undesired miners with the miner tree. If each block was 1Mb that would be 52.6 Gb as proposed. (Bitcoin1 would be 248Gb so far.)

@_date: 2013-07-23 17:04:12


It mitigates or solves the problem of a highly resourced attacker producing or buying more hashing hardware than everyone else, then including only favored transactions.
In Bitcoin 1, there is no way for users to ostracize that attacker.
In Bitcoin 2, it becomes obvious that the transactions signed by a particular mkey are undesired by the users (for instance, a miner's blocks only ever include transactions that appear in the USG Official Allowed Bitcoin Address List). Bitcoin 2 users can blacklist the miner's mkey to prevent him from getting their transaction fees. I think the lower half of page 11 is a way to additionally invalidate the spam blocks the attacker produces, so he doesn't get the coinbase transactions either.
@_date: 2013-07-23 16:47:22


Bitcoin2 is no less anonymous than Bitcoin1, except for the miners, who are known by their mkey only (unless they choose to say more)


i didn't read this anywhere?


this is one of the potential *attacks* that Bitcoin2 is attempting to mitigate


money is made the same way in Bitcoin 2 as it is in Bitcoin 1; and according to the same block reward schedule. Bitcoin 2 miners' code would be slightly more complicated. the miner who mines the block uses his mkey to sign the list of transactions in the block, including the coinbase transaction, which he can decide to split with poolmates or send to a central pool address.
@_date: 2013-07-23 16:42:53






to transfer Bitcoin1 &gt; Bitcoin2 you simply spend to yourself, there's no auditing of who owns what coins, simply counting a total


not sure how? the potential for Bitcoin1 miners to only include KYC transactions is a bigger privacy risk imo


Nah there would be fewer transactions, and clients would have to keep fewer blocks. There would be plenty of stress involved in the transfer, sure


you can spend to yourself, or program a client or a script to spend to yourself. personally I think the lost coin lottery is unnecessary but it doesn't seem very onerous.
