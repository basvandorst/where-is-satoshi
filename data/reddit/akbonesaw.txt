One could speculate that the cost of implementing such an idea is relatively low and the additional revenue from people who would legally stream content ie. GoT, Walking Dead, etc if it was more affordable and easily accessible would be net positive.  The future will soon tell.

I guess I am confused then. I thought value was a subjective characteristic.  
If I had two pairs of woolen mittens, but could only wear one, the surplus mittens have no value to me. So I find someone who has two wool hats. They don't have a two heads so they trade me for mittens.  We both traded something of little value to ourselves in exchange for something that we did value. 
Maybe btc has no value to you, but you have not the perspective of me.

No, btc is not a get rich quick scheme. It is a protocol. That is like asking if the internet is a get rich quick scheme. 
The internet was a platform in which many people became very wealthy very quickly, but it was no scheme. It was a new way of doing things and it has become an efficient tool to build wealth. 
Bitcoin is the tool, what you do with it will determine how prosperous you will be.

I appreciate your argument.  Though i will respectfully disagree that it has zero value. I understand that Bitcoin as a system is a proof of work. Similar to what a notary does with legal work, the block chain could provide a permanent record of something.  I think we have not yet seen the full potential of the distributed network. It may not fit your definition of a currency, but the protocol is, if nothing else, a precursor of systems to come.

The dollar is not backed by anything but the peoples faith in it. 
All fiat is simply an IOU where both parties agree on its value. Bitcoin is the same, but unlike the dollar, it cannot be counterfeited.
Since right at this very moment I can trade my btc for almost any good, I would whole heartedly say that it does have value. As my luck would have it, I can buy traded Bitcoin for more than what I could when I traded my fiat for btc.

I'm a bit confused as to where you are going with this?  Crossing fingers? Sitting around? What are you implying? What would YOU suggest I do to teach my infant son?  
I have had btc since summer 2011. To me, btc has been one of the most interesting developments of this millennium.  My grandfather gave me a collection of silver dollars and coins that he accumulated over my life.  They have increased in value and collectibility over 30 years, but by no means do I or did he expect that with them I would not have to work hard and earn my keep on this earth.

Still think you are a bit high on your horse about LTC though.  Yes, BTC is the leader, but Litecoin has value and while I have none, is likely a good investment.  
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:47:14
Think of bitcoin as a store of value rather than an investment.
More and more people globally are learning about btc every day.  This means that the value for storing btc is a global phenomena.   As more people become aware, the global potential increases.  It has a long way to the top as far as awareness goes.
Now, as far as buying all-in on a peak, that is another question.  If you are looking long term, it will probably make no difference to put it all in now. Unless it drops below $180 which is roughly the linear trend before the recent big gains.  Which leads to my last consideration.
If you want to lower your risk against a correction(which is likely), it may be better to cost average your way in.  Buy in 5% of your available funds in descending limit orders all the way down that linear trend line.
If only I would have followed my own advice when btc hit $7/BTC.....   Instead, I spent it all.  For a little more than I had bought in at.  Which was also valuable to me at the time.

Oh boy, we've got a fresh one here.  Respect for having the guts to ask the questions.
To ask 'where does the money go' and 'where does it come from' says to me that you need it broken down ELI5 style.
Which is a good thing because I don't fully understand the cryptography and fine details.
2.  Where does btc come from.
A Bitcoin is a unit of measurement in the chain of code which makes up Bitcoin.  It is obtained or 'mined' by using specialized computing which solves pieces of this chain of code thereby granting the miner ownership rights.  The code itself and it's arrangement in the chain provide for a verifiable transaction ledger to account for all of the bitcoins that exist at anytime by any person who is connected to the network.  
This means that only through purchasing btc from someone who already owns them or mining them for yourself can you own a btc.  
Someone else may clarify or explain further.
1. Who gets the money.
Btc is money it's value is arbitrary. If you trade $1000 for 1 btc, then that btc is worth $1000 to you.  You may find someone else who is willing to buy your Bitcoin for $1200 and another yet will buy it for $200. Some people may trade you for a good or a service, but that amount will depend on its usefulness to you and it's next owner.  
When you buy from coinbase or on an exchange, you are using a middle man to make a smooth transaction between you and the person looking to sell their Bitcoin.  This other person now has $1000.  You will probably incur a fee for this transaction so the exchanger will get something typically less than 1%.  
Now in the instances of goods and services, you are able to trade some of your expertise or wares to someone with btc to spend and they can pay you directly.  Like shovel  snow for .05btc/hr.
The magic of Bitcoin will come to you if you are a believer. Just open your eyes. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:30:13
I have yet to make the switch, but BTC would directly save me money by eliminating the fees I pay to accept visa and other credit cards for my business. 
That in itself makes btc valuable to me and I don't foresee this for atleast a couple years.

My focus was those misguided fools who in stocking up 'credits' for their battle mages and level 27 doombringer cards fell upon immense wealth.  The market capitalists you speak of want nothing to do with my utopian idealism.

Truth.  You earned from your risk.

You are right.  It won't happen overnight.  But I don't think everyone is in it to get rich.  I actually hate my fucking bank.  This has a greater weight on my decision to buy and save bitcoin than anything.  I get charged by my bank for using my account too often AND not often enough.  They rape me constantly and then act like they are doing me a favor giving me 1% interest.  I feel more free with my BTC than my dollars.

Enter your location and you will see who is selling in your area.  Some will take cash.

It will likely drop.  More likely It will go WAAAY up.  Both will happen.  Only one guarantees you will get your 1 BTC.

When it comes to pocket change, I'll give it to the drunk at the stoplight 9/10. 
In the case of BTC, the charitable change has occasionally turned into gold.  I call this karmic appreciation.

You may have someone nearby willing to sell. Try [localbitcoins](
EDIT:You will pay a premium using this method.

You are better off spending $500 on a nice shovel, a couple buckets and a gold pan.  
You may be able to succeed daytrading btc, but buying mining equipment at this point is probably not the route you should be taking.

Karma is real man.

If you have a non-throwaway reddit account with karma, you can redeem your karma for BTC through the bitcoinbot.  
Yes, Free BTC.  
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:22:51
Yes, if it is a substantial amount and if the bank/irs finds out about it.  
Lets say I am a programmer, I sell my time and skill for 1btc.  If i take that 1BTC, exchange it for fiat and put it in my bank, then I will have some paper trail showing that I made money and it could be taxed.  
However, not unlike a contractor doing cash work under the table, if I keep my BTC in my pocket(wallet) and spend it on goods and services for myself, there is not much that the bank/irs can see.
Now, like you said before, the feasibility and ease of using BTC in daily life hasn't quite caught up to say a credit card.  But if you compare it to a western union transfer(which BTC just surpassed in volume), it is on it's way.

Hell no, when it goes to the moon, it is because it is widely accepted. Why change it back to fiat at that point when you can buy your gas and groceries with it.  It will be at this point that I only accept BTC in my business.

If you are in the US.  Go to coinbase.com.  They are reputable and you can place an order within minutes.

Yes, it may take a little while for the transaction to show up on MTGOX end.  It will though. Be patient.  Transactions between wallets are much faster than transactions to an exchange.  Don't expect to quickly transfer/trade BTC at the peak volume of a price swing.  The trading systems are being outgrown rapidly as more people become involved.
I see this as an optimistic sign that it will continue to grow.

You are very right about one thing.  Bitcoin challenges the status quo.  It may just as easily be the next napster as it could be a google in terms of value.  Either way, bitcoin will not go out as a fad.  It serves a purpose in the free market and that value will only grow as governments tighten the noose on their citizens freedoms.
I have  a pathetic holdings in btc, but if someone were to offer to pay for my services with btc I would accept them every time.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:42:55
Exactly, tax free cannibalism.  Don't tread on my right to pillage.  Sober me sees your argument as valid though.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:42:05
Firstly, don't cash out.  This will put you on the hook for a ton of tax liability.  Secondly, put a substantial amount into cold storage. To keep on keeping in the direction you've been.
Thirdly, buy all your holiday gifts with btc!  You can make some pretty awesome stocking stuffers with gift cards and other goodies!  Share a little of your good fortune with your close family and friends.
If you want some real karma, donate to a charity cause that you believe in!
