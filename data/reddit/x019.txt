Nothing at all.


Me too. But that's not quite how it works. each mod has absolute power over a mod below them. So looking at the list, I could remove a few mods since they're added after I was, but I can't do anything to a mod above me. Even if all of us wanted to stage some sort of coup against q, we couldn't because he's at the top.

I didn't have more than 1 BTC, so I couldn't withdraw it. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:04:13
ELI5. What is this and why is it bad?
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:34:36
So does this mean that all of my bitcoin with them is gone? :(
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:29:32
I've been a redditor longer than you have, also studied programming (had to do some marketing stuff in college as well). I'm skeptical by default of most things, but there's no need for cynicism. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:35:33
Sure you can. Smart fella like you should be able to see that. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 14:01:47
There's a difference between inactive mods and inactive users. Someone can be an active user but an inactive mod. Only higher mods can remove lower mods.
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:48:30
Why not just be a realist then?

    Hot
                       Such power
Did they mean to get Dogecoin?
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:19:11
Joke's on you! I don't even has access to my Bitcoin because MTGOX is closed!
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:44:48
I'd just like to be able to pull out my .6 bitcoin from them but they don't allow for withdrawals of less than 1.
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:53:59
No sir.

Bought on Mt Gox. Feelsbadman.

No no no. I know that I could add more mods, but I can't remove a mod that's above me. And probably wouldn't work since the user are still active, but them as mods are not. As in the people who are mods still do things on reddit, but they don't do mod actions. The idea would work if they didn't do anything on reddit at all (we did that in @_date: 2017-08-17 15:37:19

I've cloned lots of drives. I use a program I got from a Humble Bundle to do it. You get yourself a couple SATA&gt; USB caddies and put a hard drive in each. Then you click the clone button on the program, choose the destination drive and then the source drive. Then, depending on how big of a clone you're doing, it will take a couple minutes to much longer and then you're good.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:27:37
You can plug it in when you're ready to clone. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:13:35
So how do I get my BTC or cash?
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:25:18
But how do I get it?
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:33:35


I had like 8 bitcoin in MTGOX before it went under. I totally agree. :'(
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:51:10
Right, but they took my bitcoin down with them. If I could have gotten that out of there, I'd be way better off.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:13:25
I didn't know how. It was all in Chinese.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:32:47
I don't remember getting those. But like you said, BTC wasn't worth a ton then and it was work.
@_date: 2018-11-12 01:57:32
So say I had a couple BTC from like 2012. How does one access the forked coins?
@_date: 2015-09-14 20:30:18
What are the chances of me getting any of my money back from this? I've been getting emails from them, but it's all been in Japanese. I got a letter in the mail too.
@_date: 2015-09-14 23:32:18
Looks like I may be SOL. I tried to log in and it wasn't having it.
@_date: 2015-11-14 20:26:20
To play the other side, stock markets will do this if someone does something that is obviously an error.
@_date: 2015-03-30 16:27:53
bitcoin should NOT be used as a savings. You want it to be liquid and readily available in a savings account. Not in an up and down (even if it is showing a steady upward trend) currency.

I'm pretty sure it's set up so that as a memorial for Sean.
@_date: 2013-08-08 18:32:07
I don't get it :(
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:31:43
I've been reading about bitcoins for the past few weeks but have never bought one. I meant to buy one then when it was about $80 and now I'm kicking myself. My plan is just to sit on it and wait for it to go up. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:51:53
I would cry.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:33:35
150 BTC would get me to do a lot of things. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:38:43
I'm sure you could find them with enough money. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:22:10
I've never seen it before now! I must be one of today's 10,000.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:05:49
So would this be a good time to buy?
@_date: 2013-10-19 04:22:46
I'll give it 3 weeks before the government steps in to give you Democracy.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:05:32
I don't get it :/
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:44:23
Considering that's like 5 grand, I would imagine you could get all the skins ever with 20.
@_date: 2013-08-08 18:48:32
Oooh. Okay. I was thinking along those lines, but thought it may have been in reference to a single case.
