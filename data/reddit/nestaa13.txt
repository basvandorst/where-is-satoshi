Truth is, if it crashes, there are hyena’s waiting on the sideline to buy bitcoin on sale. This train has no brakes my fellow hodlers!
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:31:08
It’s not a serious correction. It’s a ‘serious’ correction. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:49:33
Bitcoin doesnt need reasons bro
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:41:08
Today’s ATH, is tomorrows dip. Congratz

18 hours ago it destroyed the 12k wall like it was nothing. And now this. It’s just insane! I mean it’s just bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:11:46
Yeah nah..
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:17:39
Thats weird. Google it, you don't have to pay.

Do you guys choose a random day and time, or? My strategy is buying weekly without emotions. Always hold. Only buy more when a huge correction or crash occurs. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:37:21
Come one bro, the price was a bit steady for a couple of days and lots of people said $4400 was the top and 'big correction/crash' would come etc etc. This proves them all wrong. Im not that kind of people who post every single ath. Let me enjoy this moment because this proves all those correction/crash yellers wrong :)!

Sorry for your loss bro! I lost also 3k from an exchange called btc-e. I needed time to process that but it is all experience and you have to learn from it, and get back stronger. Sh*t happens. Bought the ledger and I use now only hardware wallet or else if that's not possible a desktop wallet. Reload and move further :)!

I gave up when he said: "none of them are going to win." He denies the whole blockchain technology.

It may, it may not. For the long term (if you believe in bitcoin), yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:01:11
Congratulations mate. You’re a good lad. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:03:13
There are many ways:
They could just ban bitcoin, but then everything will continue underground. 
They could shut down exchanges which I think is the weakest point of bitcoin atm. But it still won’t stop bitcoin 100%. 
They could attack miners in certain countrys, but still. There will be other places in the world where the mining will still go on. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:13:35
It suddenly popped as one order and amount, so it was only ONE order. Insane. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:48:49
For those spreading FUD, just stop. Zoom out and you can see it’s the third correction this year. First one was the dip 1850. Second one was 3000. And now we have a dip at 5500. Yes guys, the bottoms are getting higher and higher. 
We survived this attack/civil war/coup. Yes we ‘gave’ a value of around $1000-$1500 to the segwit2x lovers, but hey gues what; bitcoin is still worth +6k.

What does sell mean? Just waiting to buy more. Selling... are you kidding me ?!
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:52:33
Indeed! It's like if the WANT to kill bitcoin. Unbelieveable. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:54:42
You only sell when you are 100% sure where the dip ends. Do you know it?
@_date: 2017-09-17 07:44:39
A limit of one bitcoin per person
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:53:29
If you fall for this, maybe you deserve a life lesson.. i mean come on.. natural selection
@_date: 2017-09-05 06:54:01
Indeed. It happens to a lot of people who bought at the top. The question is, how low will bitcoin go and when will be the top no longer be the top. That my friend, is something that no one knows. We will have to wait for the answer. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:51:51
That what will happen already happened. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 08:05:33
Haha I know, but i still think that people can come with a objective advice about this 
@_date: 2017-09-17 09:58:17
And the other 65%?

Just hold for at least a couple of months. If you don't sell then you won't loose anything. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:23:22
The question is if the price will go below $2000. Im really excited to buy cheap bitcoin but the question remains, what will be the bottom..
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:17:40
His username says enough bro.. thanks for sharing your opinion! Im looking for a good entrance and hope that the price will go down again hehe

It is forbidden to ask this question as a hodler. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:12:23
I’m thinking the same way. If i turn my other crypto’s in BTC i own exactly 1 btc. Sometimes I think about to do this..
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:10:04
Hehe :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:55:00
How about hardware wallets like ledger nano S?
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:13:14
Doesn't matter, will buy more :)

No one knows. Tip: never sell, just buy more and more (the dip).
