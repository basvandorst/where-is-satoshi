Hey man.  I spent some time and money on this and I could never figure out how to buy crypto through Coinbase API with a 3DS card.  I was even talking to Coinbase Devs and they were too busy to help me.  
Either way, on the horizon is possibly moving away from Coinbase.  Obviously international support is on the radar.  
One other thing, you can use our alt coin buyer.  It doesn’t use 3ds cards.
Anyways, I was super bummed we could not figure out the UK thing.  I hate losing tech battles.  I’m not giving up just putting it on the back burner.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:44:12
It worked for you?  How?  
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:51:49
Ha, thanks!
We just pushed iOS yesterday to the App Store, Android is being worked on.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:06:06
I don’t think any other exchanges offer it yet, I wish.  What’s your second question?  
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:00:53
Okay.  Cool.  What do you mean by 'Change the view so titles are more obvious/add a floating key.'
I see what you are saying...what are some of the sites you have open?  Or at least can you give me your top 3 or 5?
So you are saying a hub that gets all the trading sites in one place and applies some logic on the site that tells you if that site says 'Buy' or 'Sell' for that day for a specific coin. Sweet.  Feel free to dm me or hit me up at info with more specifics.
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:46:16
Yeah the trading algorithm needs work: it buys on the first uptrend then sells everything on the next down trend.  Then repeats.  Maybe it shouldn't sell everything but only like %15.

Here's some more info:

Spoiler alert, the Reddit bot loses money.  Besides that small problem, what do you guys think?

Here's the yearly trend:

I have it set up to update everyday, it should be up to August 26th according to Google Trends:
I'll fix this, nice catch!
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:14:11
Ahhh, I see, cool.  I'm gonna make another section that compares the Google strategy with different strategies, I'll make sure the dollar cost averaging strategy is on there.  Sounds like dollar cost averaging is just basically going into Coinbase (or whatever platform) and setting it to buy for you every week, right?
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:29:17
Hi guys, I made this!  Would love your feedback.
This site:
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:29:29
I'm working on making this more up to date.  It's gonna be tricky because Google Trends has no API.
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:45:27
Yeah, good point.  I'm personally a hodler.  I wonder if there's a way to rethink this from that perspective?
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:01:56
Ahhh, I know.  I've heard this from a few people on Reddit. I'm gonna have to do something super jankey to make that work, I'll do it. I'll post back on here when I got it. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:28:05
Don't totally understand, can you explain a bit more for a trading noob?
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:16:15
Have you seen this site:
Might be what you are looking for?

Thanks bro!

Hi guys,
I built Coinflash, an app that rounds up your spare change into crypto.  I just added a feature last week where every month, referrers get paid in Ethereum out of a $100 a month pot.  The most Eth goes to the top referrers.  Curious what you guys think. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:32:30
Check out:
It will notify you when google is trending up for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:39:16
You pay the same fees Coinbase charges for each transaction, you pay $1 a month to Coinflash (me).  Check out the help page for Coinflash:
Also, in this video I run through the security and how it works:
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:57:43
Guys, check Coinflash now.  The API we are using has incorporated a ton more Canadian Banks.  This is Lou, the founder of Coinflash.  Tell me if your bank shows up.  
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:35:34
I made a bot that will email you when google searches goes up for Bitcoin/Ethereum/Litecoin:
You can also back test a strategy where you invest on crypto based on the Google bot strategy, thoughts?
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:03:45
Dude I'm building U.K. Support right now!
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:00:49
Also, ApostateAardwolf, just added UK support, can you give it a go and hit me up if it doesn't work?
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:46:37
Ha I fixed this yesterday so the error reporting wasn't there before!
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:06:25
Oh I thought they got rid of the spare change feature?  
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:48:46
The fees are the same exact fee you would get from buying that amount from Coinbase.  So Coinflash counts up all your change on from the last month.  Adds it up.  Then queries Coinbase to buy that amount of BTC and ETH.  Whatever Coinbase would have charged you if you had used their interface is the exact charge Coinflash charges you.  Make sense?
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:43:12
Yup that's right, but this next month is free, I'm offering it for free for all beta users.  I know it's only a buck but, might throw another month in there too for these early users.
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:26:21
Check out coinflash at  - invests your spare change into Bitcoin.  Slowly but surely, you can get into BTC with your spare change purchases on your credit card.  It's my app, hit me up with any questions if you have any.
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:01:09
That would suck.  But I'm
Bringing them money in fees.
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:01:17
That app doesn't exit anymore afaik.
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:46:05
Okay this is a great idea, thanks!  Yes, infographics.  Very smart.  And example fees.  Okay, cool. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:01:52
Is the button not showing up?  Nooooo, do you have adblocker installed?  Are you in mobile, I hate this bug.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:59:24
Hey try the app now, just added UK support over the weekend.
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:42:57
Hi Guys, I built this thing, hit me up with questions!
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:04:08
You can basically use it for free if you keep using your referral code.  You get 3 free months for every referral you make.  Referrals only count if they sign up completely.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:28:04
Can you DM me your email so I can trouble shoot?  I'm assuming your transactions aren't showing up.
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:00:44
Yah it depends on API but I am planning on rolling out non bank related features like automatic investments, saving up for a special occasion using crypto, scheduled buys of crypto, buy crypto every time you walk 15k steps....stuff like that, just having fun buying crypto, also would love to get more coins!
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:22:34
Kraken doesn't offer oAuth2 connection to their API and Coinbase won't talk to me, too big, but trust me I'd love lower fees.
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:04:11
Crap do you see the google sign in button?
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:02:18
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:37:17
Ok I'm gonna see if someone has solved this online, thanks for the tip.  UBlock on Chrome?  I'm gonna try to reproduce error, thanks dude this is a huge clue for this bug.
@_date: 2017-10-01 03:01:17
Yeah this is a great idea.  I love it.  I'm putting it on the to-do list.
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:45:05
You get the same charge you get if you bought through Coinbase for that amount.  
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:00:10
Just added UK support, can you try it out?  Email me if you have any issues.
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:45:04
So here's a video outlining everything:
But the gist is Coinflash does not handle any wallets.  It just queries Coinbase to make purchases and this crypto gets put into your Coinbase wallets.
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:14:49
It's not chump change, it's the sum of all the change from the week or month so about 10-50 dollars.  But yah the Coinbase fees are kind of a bummer.
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:46:32
It's actually only web based right now:
iOS is 3-4 weeks away.
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:12:02
Can you DM me a screenshot, I jus dm'd you.  Also open up JavaScript console if possible with screenshot
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:18:09
Oh no...I'm gonna fix this bug right now!  Are you using Adblock software?
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:04:28
Email me if you have issues, I'm also on the chat app right now.
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:47:06
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:13:17
I can check with API but I'm pretty sure yes.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:03:24
Hey dude, I don't understand your question completely.  
Also, if you are UK, can you sign up on Coinflash?  I just added UK support and am looking for testers.  
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:02:55
It should.  Hmm send me a screen shot.
