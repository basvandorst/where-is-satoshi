Better to use inflation riddled fiat for buying stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:56:02
Really? Why does everyone care their investments depreciated after a surprise move from a supposedly well established and trusted exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:38:38
You must be 12.

Someone should make a meme to tear down that wall.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:25:08
I'm worried that these guys will orchestrate a giant laundry. Drive up the price by buying lots of coin, short it then dump the coins on the market to drive the price down. Not sure how much they can short before korea and Japan just buy the cheap btc and drive the price back up.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:30:28
Thats going to drive the price even higher! The tulip bubble was caused by changes in regulation where you could cancel a contract by paying a nominal fee. So if the current price was too high you simply paid the fee and got out which is basically trading in futures. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:53:32
Yea back to the actual price floor would be nice before creeping back up.

You just convinced me Satoshi was Hal’s pseudonim. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:43:06
Last bottom was 13k bounced twice, my guess is 15k this time and back to 18k against 20k sell wall this time tomorrow.

The who is going to compute the blockchain if there is no reward in it?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:08:37
They say most of it is in cold storage with some in a hot wall for trading. Reference: 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:47:38
Launching a new coin without notifying their users and allowing for insider trading. That is completelly unprofessional and highly illegal on any other type of exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:01:14
‘Tis but a scratch.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:14:15
Ok I’ll call it bcash then. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:57:32
What an asshole move. They should have announced this so that everyone would be aware. Now insiders dumped their btc. Fuck coinbase, fuck gdax, fuck bcash and fuck Ajit Pai.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:02:47
Thanks bro.

@_date: 2017-12-20 14:04:00
People are going to cash out their bcash? How much bcash is there?  If there is a lot and people do cash that money out and send it to their bank accounts its going to suck up coinbase’s cashflow.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:58:57
HODL seems to be the safest easiest most sure bet strategy in the long term.

He looks kinda like Steve-O.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:12:50
Sounds like functional testing for a trading bot. Once the bugs arr worked out the owner can unleash trading a few orders of magnitude more.

Whale cashing out. Edit - maybe sell at 17.1 and buy thr next dip?
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:38:25
What is with his lack of respect from CNBC? Really? CNBC tells a twitter user to “Deal with it” when being called out for promoting bcash? Who does that!?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:52:53
And decentralization of global currencies.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:57:32
How do you set the trailing stop buy? I know how to set the stop but not trail the average in gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:34:56
Cryptonick to see some of his investment strategies.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:16:24
Its at 9.5k. Someone is selling a few coins  to himself at 9.5k to drive the price up?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:52:34
I once counted a few thousand in cash. Solid half hour there nervously counting and double checking the amount. Afterwards I quickly deposited it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:21:07
Going to gemini. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:49:52
Coinbase could have issued a statement in advance and people here would be saying that there is going to be this new coin that will be added in a specific date on their favorite user friendly exchange called gdax. Now coinbase looks like mtgox part deux in amateur hour.

Any source on the Charlie Lee attack? He’s like the most outspoken soft-spoken dude In bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:45:46
Is there another example where a comodity was introduced into the futures market? How did it react?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:33:35
Yea 17350 is the new base.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:43:05
In hindsight I could have taken out my 401k , penalties and all, and invested in the beginning of the year and become a millionaire. I'd like to see an AMA about someone who did something similar just to try and understand their rationale. Maybe they know something I don't.

It’d be awesome if we could get dogecoin to surpass
Bitcash.

You sound like one of those "get govment hans off muh medicar" types.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:32:34
I saw the buys munch that wall in two bites.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:58:47
Damn bcash is the chinese knockoff of bitcoin and the price reflects it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:39:53
I thought bitcoin was about transparency, about having all transactions out in the open so that they can be examined and therefore trusted. It is not about allowing fraud. If anything, its about accountability. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:44:36
That is a false statement.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:47:55
I saw it too, greens just tore down that wall in seconds. Who is putting up these walls???

Moving to Gemini. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:18:22
They should make anouncements and stick to the publicized dates like a well managed exchange, not surprise the shit out of people and fucking up the market.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:16:13
So basically add a cost layer for risk cover then stabilize price? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:34:33
We may just break 20K this year.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:02:23
There are uses for gold in the industrial sense like gold plating for electrical contacts, etc. However, bitcoin also has a use. Not in the industrial sense but in the historical sense. It is a currency without a source nation, with all of its transactional history out for everyone to see and explore. It has value because it is trustworthy.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:23:25
Technically those guys started facebook which is worth billions. Now they built a bitcoin exchange and put 11million in capital which is now worth billions. They score 2 for 2 when it comes to billion dollar ideas.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:54:07
Look at other (well managed) exchanges like cex.io. Btc is not crashing there. Hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:39:28
If a large percentage of bcash owners convert to usd and try to wire that money its going to kill coinbase. Bcash is basically a split with lower but significant valuation. That money didn’ come from a bank transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:38:00
Isn’t that gay?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:25:03
Well it worked
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:10:07
Claiming that the team of coders from core bitcoin is not good was highly unprofessional. I’m not willing to support that guy or whatever he is pushing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:58:59
Coinbase is investigating itself???
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:52:20
Yeah i just like the hashing contracts and the market analysis, not the bit pyramid scheme that is bitconnect.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:06:16
Check how many transactions tho. A single trade 3k bcash coins drove up that price. There is no more activity and now there is a huge buywall.
@_date: 2015-11-02 18:24:32
Is this like a stock split? Space will the price increase after the split.?
@_date: 2015-11-19 10:38:38
I have a pi lying around in the house. How cost effective is it to generate coins? Last I heard the most cost effective way of hashing was to use a powerful PC with an AMD GPU or use a dedicated solution (which was expensive). Edit-grammar
