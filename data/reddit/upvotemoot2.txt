Click "Max" in the send tab and whatever money it takes out of your actual entire wallet is the fee.
Also, yes, but I still plan to not open Electrum anyway until I decide to make the transfer since I'm nervous.

Oh when I was asking if it would get lost I meant like.. lost in limbo. Not in the original wallet and not in the receiving wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:34:34
Oh ok good. Thank you
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:54:28
Oh yeah I'm sure there's a way. I see it in mBTC. I'm not sure where in the settings but it's there.

Uhh. Idk what utxo is but I can link both the txids

Oh ok good, cause I have 320 coins and I just moved them to a hardware wallet cause my Electrum got hacked and I saw the outgoing transaction that I didn't make. Luckily the hacker used a low fee so I double spent it to a new wallet with a higher fee. 
I cried even though I saved it. Now I almost started crying again since I lost over 1m euros.

thats like... .04mBTC and it still goes through?
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:11:03
I'm not even sure to be honest. I have 15 transactions that added up to my .3btc and I want to move it all to my new hardware wallet and Electrum wallet lets you choose the fee by mbtc/kb. 
When using the default fee it's going to charge me $200, but I can edit the fee in the settings to be much less, and I was wondering how low I could actually go.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:43:30
Well, 1mbtc = 100,000 satoshis
Then, 1kb = 1024 bytes
1024 x 74 = 75,776
75776 satoshis/kilobyte would confirm in 7.5 days, so that means... 
.75mbtc/kb, right?

So I don't have to worry about it getting "lost" or never mined or anything? Do I have to keep my hardware wallet plugged in for the entire duration of the transfer?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:03:44
You're so smart I wish I was you.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:32:59
I don't know what determines a size, all I know in Electrum when I click "Max" to send the max amount it takes away $200 to pay for fees.
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:22:00
Well Electrum uses 3.96mBTC/kb and it estimates within 25 blocks. 
I was thinking about doing .5-1mBTC/kb so it would take 100+ blocks. Do you think it wouldn't get mined?
Also I was wondering since I'm using a hardware wallet would it have to be powered on for the duration? I'm not too experienced with hardware wallets.
