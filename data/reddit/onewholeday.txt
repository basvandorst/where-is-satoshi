I used an old version of electrum wallet I don't have the seed to anymore and purchased them over local bitcoin using an email which has long been deleted so I have no record of the purchase.
It's not only pretty easy it's also very plausible.

Nope, incompetence always wins.

The government is us though, we decide we don't want people to do certain things because it damages society etc
Don't be fooled into pretending the government is not ultimately beholden to the people.

What a fuckwit point of view. ANYONE. ANYONE.
There is no way in hell there isn't a single person who was attracted by those things, because I'm that person. So that's one. Having to pay large fees eliminates entirely the usefulness of small transactions - they just aren't worth it.

Yes you're lucky. Likely not doing very complex transactions and know what you're doing. For lots of people this is not the case.
I am involved with a bitcoin business and full blocks are a pain in the ass to so many business plans and customer service issues.

I'm cool with seats back if you are.

Nothing can ever be known for sure.

A bit unfair to cut down 21.co's success in the article, especially when they fail to mention their most recent development.

They have a profile and task messaging system where you can pay people BTC to reply to your messages or to perform tasks.

Considering bitcoin isn't on the road to be digital cash, merchants would be stupid to adopt it, tx fees are too unpredictably high for consumers to use for the majority of products.

This is the great bitcoin experiment.
It's a network, it's a currency but it's way more. It's the pulse of the planet. As bitcoin continues to encompass the world, the pulse will more and more represent the sentiment of the people as a whole.

ITT people who don't understand the basics of our capital system.
@_date: 2017-01-24 23:39:33
Oh come on don't make actual sense. The fuck outta here.
@_date: 2017-01-19 09:33:59
Sure but in the meantime, merchants can't use it because it's not reliable.
@_date: 2017-04-11 22:02:26
They are a fucking mess (especially given the money they raised) and shouldn't be operating.

I detest blockchain.info but they do have a good fee system.
