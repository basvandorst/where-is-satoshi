Especially with what's happening now, it could be best to wait for it to confirm. A few days ago I had a transaction confirm that took 2 weeks! I had given up on it too but was surprised to see it did eventually confirm.

Amazing to see all these weak hands. My brother sold all his bitcoin (a fair amount!) at 10k and I just laughed! I'm not even invested in bitcoin, I'm in VEN (which to be fair has dropped with btc) but I find it amazing that people are selling out. Despite dropping in price, there has been hundreds of millions invested into bitcoin during this dip in the knowledge that it will go back up.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:49:23
To the people who say it's going back up:
Go look at any chart and you will see that almost every time a coin goes down, it bumps up slightly every now and then on it's way down. Technically then, even on a downslope it's possible to day trade successfully. Though I don't recommend it, that's basically what is happening right now. Bitcoin went down to 9k and people speculated it would go back up, possibly to 10k, before it continued going down below 10k.
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:42:09
So you want to buy bitcoin for millions in cash every day? And your asking us? Your gonna get killed or robbed.

I've had an unconfirmed transaction for a week or so because my wallet set fees too low. However, I read today that you have to keep your wallet open and be online for it to keep resending the transaction. Is that true? Do I need to be online with my wallet open and be online?

We have not reached the bottom of the dip. Nothing has changed to improve demand for bitcoin except for the low price. If anything things have only gotten worse in the last day. I expect it to drop to at least below 13k again. Hodl and wait longer before buying the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:40:49
 Uses the real price of bitcoin without including any bullshit fees to display a higher price, it allows purchase with card, has extremely quick verification. The only downside is the 10% fees (5% base fee plus 5% if you use card). You can use a bank transfer to cut down this fee to just 5% I believe.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:25:21
Just stop making me cringe please. Hodl and go for a walk irl without your phone.

@_date: 2017-12-25 15:08:54
I believe coinbase uses different prices for buying and selling. So if you go now to buy it might say 13.9/btc but if you go to sell it might say 13.4/btc.
This is essentially their way of adding deceptive fees, which to be fair a lot (but not all) of websites do. 
So it may be profitable to do it, it's called arbitrage, but it's likely not.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:46:49

I suspect it will drop below 13k. In fact it already went below 13k today. Anything below 12k is perfect for buying in my opinion. Of course it is possible it won't drop that low... at least for a while...

Bit of a noob myself but I think it's the key phrase you need to restore your wallet. So in effect anyone with those words can set up a wallet and access your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:06:07
It's now under 15k 
Edit: and dropping fast, on the way to 14.5 and below

As you can see from the top of that page that site gets its info from GDAX, which is an exchange. To each their own but I prefer not to get the price from exchanges, but from more impartial websites.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:11:58
I have the same problem with GDAX verification despite being verified on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:50:43
Except, percentage wise, certain alt coins yielded better returns.

If a lot of the investments in cryptocurrency are based on returns in fiat, instead of faith in the idea of cryptocurrency, Ripple has the potential to rocket and take over bitcoins popularity. It's seen a 70% rise or so in the last week following the Big Dipper. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:43:52
Most people here believe in btc and as such, hodling, they do believe it will rise way past its current price. It's always easy to look back at previous prices and think it's too late to invest because it would have been better back then. But if you invest now it might go up and you can still make a profit. Or not.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:54:21
Of course you need to pay fees. $20-$50

Hi guys I have a bitcoin core wallet that I opened years ago. I have access and use but no idea about my seed words or anything like that.

@_date: 2017-12-18 01:27:27
If they haven't declared it illegal then your fine. It's also fairly anonymous depending on how you do it. Keep your bitcoin in a private wallet, not in an exchange, google the instructions if you must.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:38:26
Paybis.com, extremely fast verification and you can buy with card up to 10k usd per day.
I know you don't know me but I'll happily vouch for this website, they have live chat who are extremely helpful and instantly reply, I invested about 20k through paybis

I've been waiting for u/freewallet_support for 39 days. They have all the requested info and continue to stall when I have provided and offered extensive proof. One support member claims progress is being made yet after 39 days I'm told "no new news" Then u/freewallet_support ignores me because no one can explain what's the delay.Ive asked for management. Nothing. I'm not into calling names but this is rediculous.

It might go back down to 16000 at lowest and then climb back up over 17000
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:02:38

Layers depend upon use. Creating a layer doesn't mean it's there on the blockchain. The LN isn't going to be universally adopted, nor is it going to be 'placed on the LN' as if it were a standard universal addition to the block chain. 
Layers work by utilising the (in this case) block chain, but it needs users to choose to use it in order for it to be used.

Ripple is crashing too
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:37:28
You should be able to go to receiving, create new address, copy address. You can make as many as you want for each time you send bitcoin from an exchange to your wallet, or even use the same address every time. 
If you want bitcoin on your wallet you must decide which exchange to use, if your gonna bank transfer to the exchange in order to buy bitcoin or simply use a card (higher fees). Most exchanges will let you withdraw your bitcoin to your wallet where it will be safe. Be careful of exchanges that don't let you do this like that pieche of shit website etoro which is basically a scam.
