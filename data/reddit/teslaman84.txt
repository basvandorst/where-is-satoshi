No idea there really, I'm a Reddit n00b, lol.

Ugh, figures I missed that, lol. Thanks.

I sure hope so. Lol, indeed. I painfully watched as the price went up above $1k and was unable to sell, then I cursed their name as I watched it crash, lol. Really the only reason I am selling the BTC is because I need the money. Otherwise I would hold them, or use them to buy directly with Bitcoin. If only I could pay my bills in BTC, lol.

Yeah I caught that one, I hope yours gets resolved too. Unfortunately, it seems to be a pattern with them. Once they improved their support, they had no problem quickly responding to me. But, both times that I have gotten them to the point of trying to verify my account, they just stop responding. So to me, that seems unrelated to the big merchant integration.

Whatever the reason, taking features and options away, or severely limiting them, is very bad form. At least when software does it, I can just refuse to update it, lol. That's the kind of thing that drives people away. Especially when they keep doing it repeatedly.
Anywho...I just want my account back!

Wow, Thanks! :)

Perhaps that is a bit sensationalist, but I would have to say, yes. They have my BTC and are refusing to let me have it by actively ignoring my problem.
It wasn't a case of getting a new number, so no, I didn't know ahead of time. True, the failure of the number is not Coinbase's fault, but not resolving the issue and having a system that does not confirm ownership, is Coinbase's fault.
Cheers and yeah, hopefully they will resolve it. I know Reddit can't do anything about it, but maybe the exposure will help get Coinbase's butt in gear. Two months is just insane.

Oh they did? Geez, yeah that really sucks! I don't get why they are making things continuously worse and treating people so badly. That is very bad for business.

Well, after 3 months, my issue was finally resolved! That is insane, but I'm just glad to have my BTC back. Here's a very useful tip though: If you permanently can't log into your account anymore, then tell them as much and just create a second account. Forget trying to get support to reset your login info. They will move your coin to the new account and close the old one. That's what I finally did after getting nowhere with support for months. I bet I could have saved a ton of time if I had done that from the beginning.
So, I really enjoyed the stress and the missed opportunity of selling my coin for over $1k. It inspired joy-joy feelings in me! Be well!

I've been unable to log in for over 5 weeks now, but apparently I don't count. :|
