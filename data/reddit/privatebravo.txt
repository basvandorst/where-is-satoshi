Can someone please send me a link to how I can do this? Or guide me through the process please.

I didn't make any recent transactions. It just disappeared from my wallet so no tx ID needed. But this is my BTC address: 1QGYPwNRrBnr7iCvVminWTbx6fKpgQetPx
And this is the link to where you can see the money on my account:

Yes it is the receive address. That I am positive about.

Ahh that sucks cause I needed to send one transaction from only one wallet but need more funds so I was hoping that there was a way I could export the private keys from one wallet into the other?

MultiBit Classic

When I import, do I just need the private key from my MultiBit Wallet or do I need something else?
@_date: 2017-06-24 04:27:49
Yes but the fees are so high right now, wanted to avoid that.

Honestly the best help someone could have gave. I followed the instructions exactly as followed and now I finally see my BTC. To be honest screw MultiBit - such a shit wallet. 
Once again thank you so much.

I reset the wallet/resynced. Still nothing. Does anyone know if it is safe to reinstall the application? It is a MultiBit Wallet on my Mac

I already have an another address in Electrum, no chance I can already import it into an existing address?

Also last question if you know, is there a way to combine two wallets? For example, now on Electrum I have two wallets but want to avoid the transaction fees and the wait for when I send the money so I just want to combine them into one. Possible?
