Yeah this is WU issue not a fist issue.
OP should have googled and found something like TransferWise.com

5% fee is hilarious.

What we mean is that the XE rate offered by WU is lower than the standard or interbank rate, and the rest of the 'cost' is made of fees as you pointed out.
And while no company can offer a pure 1:1 interbank rate unless they are literally a bank.... A lot of companies will however offer a rate very close to the interbank, and some will be far more preferably.

Another good option, but I believe Revolute don't offer the same exchange rates as TW, so depending on the amount of money being sent you may not get a better worse deal.
But you're right, WU is almost as criminal as the banks for their rates.

Aside from the inbred thing, this is true. NZ is not culturally homogeneous.
Therevare vast differences, mostly due to racial heritage, population size, and rate of immigration.

In other non-news homeless are huffing butane to get high.
Come on, any fringe case of stupidity or abuse can get into the media. Ignore it.
NB: it was *a single question survey*, probably posted on a crypto website. Only 1000 respondents

It doesn't matter where you get your bitcoins from as long as you get them off the exchange before the fork and into your own private wallet.
If you don't own the keys you don't own the coins, only access to the coins, and the exchange can decide to not give them to you (ie. Coinbase)
