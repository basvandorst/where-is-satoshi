Well since these scenarios all seem to be "worst case" i feel like i am likely safe with coinbase or mycellium. However i have learned quite a bit after devoting this entire night to preparing myself so ill look into these things. Thank you for the advice and if i figure out these hardware wallets i will surely use them

my definition of "the end": 1 btc= $0.......or 1 BTC = five figures in USD, or so popular that we need a BTC icon key on our keyboards just like $

is mycellium considered a hardware wallet? just got it on my phone after all the panic, set up a pin, and recorded the super secret 12 word key, so i assume my security skills maybe slightly above subpar. It seems u can dl mycellium on your PC.
IMO, seems to be paranoia on both ends. One side  says the online exchanges will steal all my coins, the other side says my offline wallets will be hacked. Im about to put half on coinbase, half on mycellium and hope for the best lol

lol fingers crossed on that one buddy

if it ever hit that, yes, id probably sell. That is an insane profit margin and would make me look like some sort of investment genius to all of my friends. Do you have higher hopes? Most hopeful BTC prediction ive ever heard was that there would be no need to ever sell your coin because in 20 or so years we will all use BTC to buy goods, and fiat would be essentially worthless

no need to get upset guy. U lose a lil bit in the past? I've known about BTC since it was about $5 a coin, and seen it steadily rise over the past years. Did a bit of research and it seems like BTC is either going to astronomically jump, or crash. It's like gambling to me. Im either gonna lose my 2200 investment or make a shitload. I do other shit in my spare time, im not planning my entire life around whether the coin rises or falls. Sorry for triggering you bud.
Since you seem to be such a Bitcoin guru, can you give me any tips, since my pea-brained knowledge of cryptocurrencies has seemed to upset you so much, master?

from my basic research, 1 BTC should be enough to make me quite a large sum of money if the legends are true. I am willing to hold this one coin for 5-10 years if necessary. The only additional thing i would do is potentially buy one ethereum

holy shit

how do i get the 12 word seed key?

in the unfortunate event that you were to get "hacked", some likely methods would be phishing (i think is the correct term), like if you accidentally typed coinbasee.com instead of coinbase.com, you would be brought to a login screen that looks exactly like coinbase's. you put in all ur crucial info, then BAM, hackers save that info, go to real coinbase, put in ur info, take ur coins, then disappear without a trace.
There is also the slim chance that whoever controls your online BTC wallet decides they want to make a few quick million dollars and disappear. Admins of darkwebsites have suddenly shut down their sites and stolen millions of dollars from filthy drug users. That is why i recommend well known, popular exchanges. 
I am not a representative of coinbase btw, that is just the exchange i use and what i use as an example

i cant answer all of your questions but i can attempt to answer a few:
IF you use a major exchange such as coinbase, hacking is unlikely. Coinbase actually offers extra authentication security so large holders are not hacked. I would be wary accessing via phone however.
If your computer explodes, your coins will still be held in whichever online exchange you have them in as long as you remember your username/password/securityquestion/textverification
to my knowledge it is possible to store your coins on an external usb drive if you are nervous about hackers. However, if your computer explodes while said usb drive is inside computer, coins will be destroyed as well.
in regards to selling coin, you can sell them at market rate instantly using the same site you bought them from (i use coinbase), or, you can use a site such as localbitcoins to sell them to a third party at a slightly higher rate. I am unable to teach you how to do this however.
I hope this information was correct and helpful

I use coinbase. I dont have a credit card, so when i make a buy, it takes almost a week before the coins appear in my account. I bought one full coin from coinbase at roughly 2200. During that week the price fluctuated wildly, but when  it came time for my coin to appear in my wallet, I received exactly one coin, which at that time was worth a few hundred more.
use blockchain, or coinbase customer service to check transaction records. I have never once lost coin due to simple "mistake", only times ive lost was due to pure malicious hacking of an entire site
