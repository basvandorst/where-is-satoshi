These people can downvote me all they want. If they've actually got money in the game and are going long, shit's going to hit the fan for them over the next 24-48 hrs as this mini-bubble deflates. We'll see who has the last laugh.
If they can see the ones around Feb. 12, beginning of January, and the one in November of last year (just to name a few) and not connect the dots, nothing can help them.

I'm all about digital currencies, I'd love to see bitcoin take off. But if people sit here in a constant circlejerk about bitcoin without taking any time to seriously address its shortfalls and problems, then we're in for some serious trouble. 
If bitcoin doesn't become a viable option as a digital currency, some big corporation or bank will come along, take bitcoin, and make their own digital currency that solves the problems bitcoin have while probably making it centralized. People have been using centralized financial systems for a long, long time and it probably wouldn't be a hard sell to the general public for another one in digital form. 
If what people want to see in the bitcoin space is a decentralized currency used by the masses, they'd better start seeing massive price spikes as a serious problem instead of a cause for celebration.

Yea well it's still a little hard to send money around as easily as with bitcoin. People are going to begin to demand faster and easier ways to send money around, especially long distances as the financial world becomes increasingly globalized.

Soon as in at least a year.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but we aren't hitting $1000 anytime soon.
Edit: That many downvotes?? Seriously guys, you actually think were on our way to break $1000? Have your fun now, but prepare to be long squeezed. At least your downvotes don't mean I'm losing money.

Doesn't take a genius to figure out people don't want to use something with dramatic price spikes like this. People get so caught up in this hype and buying frenzy they make bitcoin look laughable. 
You think people are going to look at this chart and take bitcoin seriously as a currency? It's really embarrassing for bitcoin, honestly.

Saying something critical about the bitcoin circlejerk is a qualifier for sociopathy? God, bitcoin has become a religion. Just, just go straight past the sociopath bull and call me what I really am: a heretic.

You do have a point there. But try explaining to the average joe using bitcoin is awesome, but security is so paramount you should be suspicious sending to your bitcoins even to one of the most used exchanges with the best security records in the business. 
It's good Bitfinex is covering their customers' deposits to the compromised hot wallet, but they didn't have to do that.
And, of course, bitcoin's protocol is not to blame here for the compromised hot wallet, but how do you make using bitcoin appealing to the average joe when security requires so much attention? Credit cards are so easy to use and people use them with total peace of mind. With bitcoin, you're on your own and security is up to you, which is reflected well when they say, with bitcoin you can be your own bank. That entails all the responsibilities of being a bank, a big part of which is security. 
I suspect services will need to be built up around bitcoin the protocol before it becomes easy enough or be appealing enough for the average joe to use. People don't want to spend all their time being paranoid about how safe their money is. The banks and companies people trust with their money do that job for them. With bitcoin, you're on your own.

Just remember the price was over $1000 a year ago, whether you see that as a good or bad thing, or both.

How thoughtful, I'm sure people would at least like their stolen coins go to a good use.

I'm sure that was all in the minds of the well-funded traders when they decided to buy as they watched the price getting closer to breaking a downtrend resistance line.
I, for one, watched the drama unfold on the order book last night with somebody playing around with huge 300+ btc orders for a few hours before the price jumped.

It's conceivable, but would take a lot of effort to get that amount of data into it.

There's a pretty big difference between clearing the order book with a large order and a panic selloff.

Precisely, that's why I need to get people around here believing it's going to $10,000.

Now we just need to convince people to put their life savings into a 'currency' that swings over 50% every 30 days.
@_date: 2015-04-27 07:54:32
A bot to artificially raise the price of bitcoin is the last thing bitcoin as a currency needs. It needs to become stable enough people can feel comfortable using it to store any amount of wealth.
Who feels comfortable putting any bit of their savings in a currency that could loose 50% of it's value in the next month?
@_date: 2015-04-27 07:56:55
The reason the price fell is because the last upper resistance point at $235-$240 could not break through amidst a strong down trend.
