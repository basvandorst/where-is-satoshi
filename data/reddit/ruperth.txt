For a community of 'Bitcoin advocates,' there is nowhere near enough emphasis on educating Bitcoin n00bs. 
I imagine a lot of people come here with the intention to learn but end up becoming victims to the epeen of keyboard warriors, knowing that Andreas isn't even safe is worrying.

Not if they're set-up correctly, any hardware wallet still comes down to a piece of paper.

I work for  one of the sites listed on this site. We don't hold users funds and actively promote people to secure their bitcoins offline.
It frustrates me because a few bad actors spoil the bunch, I want BuyaBitcoin.com.au to be the best exchange in Australia but it seems that if you don't have MT GOX like size/authority your classified as "scammers". 
We have never been hacked, never scammed anyone out of money and have guided many people on how to securely buy their first bitcoins.
I'm writing this because I want to make it clear that were furthering bitcoin adoption by making it as fast, safe and easy as possible to get into bitcoin. If you think we are not doing that, pm me personally because I want your feedback.
90% of these exchanges may be scams but there are a few good guys in this space that actually believe in bitcoin and are not scamming.

is there a guide you reccomend? I dont reccomend someone tries to setup their own paper wallet printing system unless they have technical knowledge
@_date: 2015-05-29 06:01:33
You are absolutely correct. Armory is a much better example of how to set up your own cold storage. HD wallets and multi-sig offer added security, but functionally they still rely on a piece of paper.
I believe paper wallets provide a similar level of security and are easy to be adopted by bitcoin newbies.
I want to promote people to buy bitcoin and not get hacked. Paper wallets (setup securely) are better than web wallets which the majority of bitcoin owners use to store their coins today.
It's truly alarming how many people hold all their bitcoins online. I have found a lot of Bitcoin owners are not that tech savvy.
A paper wallet setup correct is unhackable and that's the point I'm trying to express.
Thanks for your input

Just for the record I wrote this blog post as a simple guide aimed at the "bitcoin holder" not "bitcoin enthusiast". I'm shocked at how many people have ALL their bitcoins held in online wallets like Btc-e even though these 'third parties' are where the majority of thefts occur from.

Hi there,
I am the person employed at BuyaBitcoin.com.au that dealt with this issue.
I can assure you we are not a scam.
We had erroneously marked your order as paid from the day previously. This assumption lead us to believe we had accidently credited you with $200 btc for free, leading to the follow-up email you are talking about.
After we got in touch with you, it became evident that we did not send you $200 worth of BTC so I offered you a discount on your next order as an apology.
I'm terribly sorry with this mistake and will call you directly to amend your concerns
@_date: 2016-01-08 01:59:24
At least the Bitcoin community can agree on one thing!
@_date: 2015-05-15 03:18:11
There is no crypto-currency. They have gold, and have build a debit card platform to use that gold. 
Its got nothing to do with a crypto-currency or the blockchain, its inspired by bitcoin and they accept bitcoin. I never called bitgold a blockchain based crypto-currency because I know it isnt.

Hi Guys,
We believe in lowering the barrier to entry and creating a tangible experience to promote trust with new users and Bitcoin. By offering a branded point-of-sales experience with a low minimum, we aim to promote the growth of the industry by adopting new users who previously saw Bitcoin as inaccessible or untrustable. [Bitcoin.com.au](
[Here is a map of our locations](
1. Purchase of $50 AUD will leave you with $46.93 worth of BTC. We are the cheapest, fastest and most trusted OTC exchange in Australia. All purchases are conducted through a Bitcoin branded POS device.
2. We are working with the [ADCCA]( to create a regulatory environment which does not create artificial costs for Bitcoin purchases. At this stage, we do not require ID information, but we are working with the industry to create AML/KYC standards which we hope will be endorsed by the Australian Governments intention to foster FinTech innovation.
3. All funds are sent to a nominated wallet of your choice. We do not hold customer funds and have made 3 guides to endorse best practice standards.
3. We aim to lower the barrier to entry and advertise Bitcoin throughout our network. Our dream is that someone can walk into a retail store and buy $1 of Bitcoin to begin experiencing the value behind this technology. At this stage, $50 is the lowest viable amount but we aim to improve this in the future.
We see this as another step towards mainstream adoption of Bitcoin which we are proud to share with you.

You are correct, we are a smaller exchange located in Melbourne, Australia.
Although our prices are not the best, we accept cash deposits, without copies of your ID and process orders in Approx 1-hour with phone support for any bitcoin related questions.
No other exchanges that you have listed provide those features. We are a small, growing exchange backed by a larger investment company, as we grow our fees will reduce.
@_date: 2015-07-23 01:55:44


Absolutely, we aim to be the Fastest, Simplest and Safest Exchange in Australia. Once a customer deposits cash into a bank of their choice, we process the order and send bitcoins out within one hour. 
If it is a customers first purchase we will call them to verify the order is in fact coming from that person. After your first order, your transactions are processed as soon as we receive you cash deposit, which takes approximately 10-minutes. Fast processing times is one of the advantages of only accepting cash deposits. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 01:18:20


Yes luckily we have a great relationship with AUSTRAC. At the moment we have a warning on our front page informing our customers of a recent scam where people are buying puppies online for bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:30:41


Your absolutely right not to trust a third party with the generation of your keys, I don't. 
The purpose of this offer is to educate and raise awareness of this issue towards people who are making their first bitcoin purchases. 
If you want Bitcoin to reach greater adoption, you have to give new customers ways to educate and familiarise themselves with how to use this new technology responsibility. We are trying to do everything within our capacity to achieve this, that's why we are doing all of this at no extra cost to the consumer. 
I believe in Bitcoin, if by this offer I help  just one person learn more about Bitcoin it is all worth it. 
You are complete valid to be sceptical, but you cant argue with getting something for free.
@_date: 2015-07-23 01:09:31


Yes, we have received consultancy from one of the top Virtual Currency lawyers in Australia. At current, there are no formal regulatory requirements towards Virtual Currency's in Australia. 
We do expect this to change and are developing strategies to adapt in the future. We are  members of the [ADCCA]( Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association and are compliant with all AML/KYC requirements. We have also be in operation for over a year, so yes were as legal as can be in this new emerging area.

CEO of Xapo?? From my educated guess, I'd say 75 million visitors per month without banking services now using bitcoin is bigger news than any bitcoin security instrument or 'first world based' exchange. Call me crazy but I think the first world will be the last to realize bitcoins transformative potential.
@_date: 2015-04-30 02:23:10
 I spoke to CEO yesterday, they agree with me :P
@_date: 2015-04-08 12:07:50
Very excited! Hopefully I'll be in the Isle of Man soon too... The dream!!

I don't know if saying bitcoin has a malleable monetary policy is necessarily more honest. But I see what you're saying.
Thanks for the feedback
@_date: 2015-11-05 22:51:04
I'm really struggling to replicate this. Are you referring to our support chat? What browser are you using? Thanks
@_date: 2015-03-12 00:55:53
Bitcoin needs a hardware interface that allows everyday consumers to trust the security behind bitcoin like they trust a credit card. Bitcoin needs a trezor for everyday transactions and smart contracts if it wants mainstream adoption.
21 inc. is on the cusp of developing this product. It will enable non-tech-savvy people to trust bitcoin and adopt based on its added benefits without concerns of losing their funds. This type of product will take bitcoin to the next level of consumer adoption in my oppinion.

Great information! Yes, I use those two sites after being on the Bitcoinwhales club a few times. I didn't know about the Fantastic4 URL though, I think I'll be using that a lot more from now on.

There's an interesting take on the idea of a centrally issued blockchain here:
@_date: 2015-03-11 23:35:53
I'm looking forward to their official announcement, this will take bitcoin to the next level in my opinion.
@_date: 2015-03-13 06:37:51


I agree with you, central authorities are not necessary thanks to p2p decentralized currencies. But decentralization is not the only benefit of a cryptocurrency. eg, the Fedcoin proposal (
I expect to see other centrally backed cryptocurrencies emerge. A blockchain (although not necessary) would be used to make them as you said still "relevant" and accountable to the public. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 04:14:42
Streamlining of financial services, lower fees and international accessibility are all benefits that could only be offered by a database with cryptocurrency as the unit of account.

Ahh yes cheers and updated
