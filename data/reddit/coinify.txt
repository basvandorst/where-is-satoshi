Hello, 
The Bitcoin network is currently experiencing a record high traffic, resulting in higher miners fees and longer confirmation times for transactions. 
Blockchain and Coinify do not collect transaction fees. Transaction fees are paid to the bitcoin miners and are determined by demand in the market for transaction confirmation. We do our best to try and provide you with the lowest possible fee that aims to achieve transaction confirmation in an acceptable timeframe. Fortunately this is not the norm and when it settles down you can expect lower fees.
Please contact our customer support at  if you have further questions. Best, Coinify

Hello, 
When buying bitcoins with bank transfer, we will send you the bitcoin within 24h on business days after we have received your payment. The final exchange rate will be determined once your bank order is processed. Note that on weekends and bank holidays bank transfers are not processed. Therefore your bank says that your transfer will be processed first on the 27th. 
If you have further questions please contact our customer support at 
Best regards,
Coinify Team

In general, for us to process your order, we need you to upload sufficient verification documents. When you buy bitcoins with credit card, your card is first charged but the order can only be completed and bitcoins sent to your wallet after you verify your card and identity. Card registration transactions expire after 96 hours if not completed and an automatic refund is issued and send to your bank account.

Hello GetSame,
Please note that the one week delay is not our standard processing times but rather a consequence due to the extraordinary situation the whole industry is going through (
For card orders, the rate is locked at the moment of making the payment and delays in delivery do not affect the exchange used.
Bank orders are always completed with the current rate at the moment of processing because we need to actually have received the funds in our bank and that might take up to several days (See: 
We hope that this information was useful to you. If you have any other questions, you are welcomed to reach out directly to our customer support team at:  Thank you.
