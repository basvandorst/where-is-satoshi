This is why privacy is crucial in crypto. It is a pre-condition to security.

Well done and thank you for putting crypto in a good light for the general public!

Inflation is purely a monetary policy phenomenon; that is, it is targeted and controlled through various means like setting the interest rate and changing the supply of money in circulation. These controls impact the price level of goods and services. 
Hyperinflation is purely a psychological phenomenon. When hyperinflation starts, monetary policy controls become ineffectual and only peoples' psychology around the population's confidence in the currency determine its purchasing power, which almost always declines at an increasing rate.

Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general, are trivially- and highly divisible. Also, if an item is too common, its use as a currency is not viable. When things are "too rare", they are divided into smaller units (like BTC's current 10^8 decimal precision). When things are too common, they are aggregated into larger units (like the Zimbabwean dollar ZWR 100 Trillion note -&gt; 10^14).

...is a footnote that managers use because they are forced to by regulators. The truth is that investment professionals obsess over past performance, analyzing and modeling it from hundreds of angles hoping to find some insight and edge before they pull the trigger. Historical performance is possibly the most important analysis input. Saying Bitcoin won't rise from here is calling a top with 100% conviction. If that's your case, then your strategy should be clear.

Genuinely interested, can you give an example of a market that does not need buyers to support price? 
Also, the argument of needing fiat to legally satisfy tax obligations has been a longstanding pillar of the anti-crypto side. But in such instances where a government accepts Bitcoin, this argument dissolves. Sure, the state may then convert, but the citizen's legal obligation will have been satisfied without touching the state currency.

You could say the expected rate of return is negative, but the expected value of a (non-borrowed) dollar invested into Bitcoin is definitely not negative - you can loose everything (return = -100%) , but you won't end up owing. Bitcoin is not intrinsically debt money and this alone has immense value.

The energy for POW for the creation of bitcoin is not nothing. Besides, the point here is that, while central banks basically have a mandate to create money and manage the money supply, the same cannot necessarily be said for retail banks and their ability to create money through lending under a fractional reserve system.
