Donald Trum is president, bitcoin is over 9000, cubs won the world series.  These are crazy days.

Over 9000.
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:34:07
I bought my last batch of bitcoin at 14500.  Since I bought a lot earlier, I'm still above water but I'm so mad I didn't wait.

That is one big green candle.

I did in fact lose money on my bitcoin investment.  I sold my entire hodling stack.  However, I don't regret it.  I still believe in bitcoin long term and am planning to buy back in as the price gets lower.

What is segwit?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:38:23
The spike to 7800 was only a temporary distortion caused by the end of segwit2x so it doesn't count in my book.  The price was more stable in the low 7000s for a long period.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:19:27
Guys, this is not a cunning attack or even an attack.  A drop of 500 is nothing when bitcoin is literally over ten times its price from last year.

Wait what?  A miner continued to mine BTC even at a loss of profit?  I thought that wasn't supposed to happen.

Although I'm overjoyed that bitcoin is going down to cheaper prices so I can buy more, I do wish it would stop going down so quickly.  I'd be in a better position to buy in January so if we could slow down our descent just a tad, maybe bounce back to the lower 4ks before going into the 2k price range, that would be perfect.
Other than that, I'm very pleased with the price action as of late.

Based of the March 2014 to March 2015 delta, the price in March 2019 should be $4000.

Read the book *Digital Gold*.  It's a detailed history on the formation and history of bitcoin (basically everything 2015 and previous.).  It's written by a New York Times reporter so it's from a reliable source.  It's also amazingly well written, it basically reads like a novel.
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:11:49
This is amazing news for bitcoin!  If another 8-10% plan on buying bitcoin in the future, just think about how many people in the *world* there are who plan on buying bitcoin.
Remember, bitcoin is a global commodity....

I was going to just post a moon meme shitpost but in all seriousness, this chart from r/bitcoinmarkets is really good as a prediction guide.

That's literally decades away.  Global warming isn't going to significantly change the temperature of the planet till 2040 at the earliest.

It's hard to see if you just read r/bitcoin.  If you go to r/BitcoinMarkets or r/btc and read some of the pro S2X arguments, you start to see that even if the legacy chain will be worth more, things are going to get super ugly on it (transfer times measured in hours instead of minutes while the new chain has transfer times of minutes, potential complications transferring money from one chain to another, just general ignorance and propaganda about what's happening creating uncertainty.).  And this will all be magnified by the previous fork, which lulled people into complacency because nothing happened.
Any of these things could spook new investors, leading to chain reaction selling and a panic.

Son, that's 75K in that wallet.  Find a way to fix it!
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:05:37


As a casual observer, I wouldn't say many businesses have denounced S2X.  Coinbase, for example, has taken a neutral stance.

Year's just starting.
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:17:39
Start with this post:  
People on this sub are saying that miners will go with the value of the coin.  The BTC argument is that if enough miners go with 2xcoin, that will change the value of legacy bitcoin such that they won't have to switch back.
My position is that there's no way to determine which set of arguments is right until we see what the hundreds/thousands of miners chose to mine in November and how much users value transaction speed and fees vs established brand.  This is an empirical question that can only be determined by data, not a priori arguments.  So I'm waiting until November to buy.

Just remember this about the increasing bitcoin price: The pride commeth before the fall.

I was going to buy 2 bitcoin when the price was 250 dollars.  I would have had over 10,000 dollars today had I done that.

There's not a huge difference between 85% and 95% when in theory all you need is a majority.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:11:08
The worst part is that I could have put 500 dollars in easily but I didn't because I saw the price of bitcoin had been flat for a while and it just didn't seem worth the bother to make an account.  I'm still kicking myself about it.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:49:18
I'm waiting for the November fork to see if the price dips before I buy.
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:31:45
No one knows how much bitcoin will rise but remember, you have to pay capital gains taxes on it.  This can be anything from 0 - 15% depending on your tax bracket.  Since how much capital gains you have to pay is based on your income, you can avoid the tax by splitting your withdrawals in such a way that it doesn't raise your income above the correct tax bracket.  For more on that, search taxes using the sidebar.
But the fact that you have to pay taxes should be factored into your calculations.
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:22:01


I'm going to buy in November after the fork and I'm OK with this senario even if I miss out on a few thousand dollars.  I think the price will drop in November but if it just goes higher, all that means is that Bitcoin is more stable that I thought it was and I should still buy.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:09:25
I am a beginner so I have no idea.  But if you want my uninformed opinion, I would recommend waiting until November to buy, then jumping on the winning chain.  By winning I mean the chain that has **both** the most hash power and the highest price.  This will clear up a lot of uncertainty or at least allow you to buy at a discount.

How can nodes "define and police consensus" if they can be set up so easily, as seen in this link?
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:30:50


Here's the thing though.  A lot of people are buying bitcoin and will get free bitcoin during the fork.  If a large enough number of people move there 2xcoins over to bitcoin, won't that spike the price of bitcoin during the fork instead of dropping it?
But that's just a theory.
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:39:25
Ha, very true!  This is the right one.

Eh, this post on r/btc convinced me it's not going to be as simple: 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:27:19
There's literally a countdown website: 
There's also bitcoin gold which is a smaller fork that will occur in October, but it doesn't have much mining power behind it so it's generally ignored.  Segwit2x, which is in November, has, on paper (and the key phrase is on paper) the majority of mining power behind it.  Which fork the mining power will follow, well that depends on how the forks are priced, and no one knows how they will be priced.
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:15:04
There's a countdown website for the fork:  
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:16:59
It will probably happen during the fork.  Lot of volatility is likely then.

Hey, I read about you in the book *Digital Gold*!  Just stopping by to say hello.


You may have regrets but you made history.  Without someone operating that first pioneering exchange, this entire new asset class and all of its future potential might never have gotten off the ground.  So few people who have ever existed have ever been in your place.  As heavy the burden of your regrets might be, I hope this thought gives you some comfort.
I think this quote by Theodore Roosevelt provides a great perspective on failure.  Perhaps you would appreciate it:

It halves in new supply every year.
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:20:25
But I would think that the fact that there are more searches than there was before indicates that there is now a larger userbase.  The long term growth in userbase is what is more important than spikes in attention.
IMHO, the giant spikes don't matter.  What matters (if you're a bitcoin investor) is that even if bitcoin falls 90% from its all time high to a new bear market, it's still 10x what it was during the last bear market.

When bitcoin was at 3k, I considered putting some money into it but held off because I was worried about bitcoin cash and the fork war drama (I know, I was a noob back then).
My mom, on the other hand was just laughing at me and was like “put a couple thousand into it”.
In the end I did at 10k.  Really wish I had listened to my Mom, I’d still be in profit right now.
