Yes cover your eyes and ears and pray for the best. If you can't see it it doesn't exist am I right?

Forks happen when differences cannot be resolved with words.
Open source has been filled with divides and many projects has forked i.e. libreoffice/openoffice, ffmpeg/avconv, mysql/mariadb, many many different Linux distributions.
Welcome to the real world.
Let it split and may the best coin win.

What's wrong with just letting Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Core fork into BTU and BTC?
Let the users pick the one they want. It'd be like ETH and ETC.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:56:31
Ethereum is the new store of value now.
@_date: 2017-01-24 23:48:00
Like bitcoin?

If everyone did this there would be no liquidity. Traders/market makers leave open orders on the book so that there would actually be an order book. It is naive to suggest that everyone, would deposit/withdraw continuously.

They aren't really a Bitcoin exchange, Bitmex only deals with derivatives such as their swap contract and futures. They do have trading fees and it works in a maker taker model. It's not an exchange to buy Bitcoin, but a place for traders to speculate on the price.

Bitcoin is a Griffen good because:
1. the good in question must be an inferior good,
2. there must be a lack of close substitute goods, and
3. the goods must constitute a substantial percentage of the buyer's income, but not such a substantial percentage of the buyer's income that none of the associated normal goods are consumed.
Right ....

Maybe if you owned a larger stake in litecoin than your reddit username your opinion might be worth something.
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:34:58
I'm just dispelling the notion that your opinions mattered even when you had your $20 worth of "investment" in the coin.
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:38:02
Why should you have the same say as someone that has invested more money than you? If you really cared maybe you'd put your money where your mouth is.
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:17:46
if you have invested as much as the people on the panel why weren't you invited? Do you understand why your opinions are worthless compared to the people that own many times the stake in litecoin than you do?
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:55:07
If you believed in the ideals of litecoin so much why aren't you putting your money where your mouth is? Everyone on that panel has more net worth invested in litecoin than you'd ever own.

There are two ways of owning a stake. 1. A lot of coins. 2. A lot of hash power. Nothing stopping them introducing a new coin daemon and using their hash power to killing the original coin. Nothing stopping them from crashing the price or running spam attacks to attack the chain when they hold that amount of coins.
Just like when I buy the majority stake in company I can effectively take it over. Think of the devs as the CEOs and CTOs and are appointed by the stakeholders. Their work creates value for the stakeholders and they are often stakeholders themselves.
You are of course welcome to make/fork your own coin though. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:05:46
I am just dispelling the notion that concensus between large stakeholders is "centralisation".
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:02:22
It sounds like you're a minority stakeholder and you rightfully don't control the direction the coin.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:54:23
Now it is pretty clear.

Did you conveniently ignore the confirmation from Tencent (and Sina) Finance?
Also regarding your quote:
Regulators decided to close all virtual currency exchanges in China. This relates to Okcoin, Huobi, BTCC etc.
If you want to argue the semantics of 涉及, which can be either "relates to" or "extends to". That's fine. That wording can be ambiguous. 
The next news item however clarifies.
Tencent Finance received information from sources close to the regulatory (PBoC) and local financing authorities which said that the regulatory has decided to shut down all registered Bitcoin exchanges in China.
Reads pretty clear to me.

Pretty sure JP Morgan [bailed out]( the government.
