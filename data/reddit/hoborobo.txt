Will this ATM have a Bitcoin -&gt; Cash option, or will it just be Cash -&gt; Bitcoin?
Either way: awesome!

I'm excited to hear this.
We currently link to 'explainbitcoinlikeimfive.com' on sfx.io, but I don't really feel like it's the best explanation in the world to someone who just wants to use Bitcoin casually.
I'd love to see a section that just explains what a wallet is and how to send / receive with a wallet. 
Something along the lines of: "A bitcoin wallet is like the wallet in your pocket, except it's on your phone / computer! To receive digital money, all you have to is grab an address from the 'receive' tab and copy/paste it to your sender".
I'm a big believer that the biggest challenge bitcoin faces is becoming easier to understand / use and that this challenge will inevitably be overcome with time.
I'm glad people like you are out there to help educate the masses!

Really interesting ideas; thanks for taking the time to jot them down. 
We're actively working on better indexing / search / discovery and are very interested in integrating bitcoin at a core level of the site. 
We love feedback / suggestions -- please feel free to send along any thoughts / ideas / etc via twitter or email. We're a small team at the moment (one developer / one designer) and are pushing updates on a near-daily basis.
Thanks again -- Clay

I don't think anyone's saying it's exactly the same.
The comparison is that the majority of the population doesn't yet know / care about a technology that could change the world ( kind of like the internet in the 80s ).

I think 30 years ago is a provides a more apt comparison.

What a great way to start the new year: waking up, checking and seeing an article mentioning sfx.io on the front page!
Thanks for the mentions and support, Clay

Major red flag: use of the word 'kindly'.

This appears to be a prototype for developers to build upon. Eventually, the architecture will be shrunk and included as a chip in IoT devices.
At least, that's my understanding.
