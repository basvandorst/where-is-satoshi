RemindMe! 7 Days
I need to give you $10. This instructor doesn't understand the reality of the changing world. They'll lose, and your son will win, period.

It's a good way to get a head start =)

Transfer Adsense revenue to Google Wallet without needing the requisite $100 ad accrual!

*Whole* Bitcoins.

Funny how a truly free market works.

If I'm not mistaken, copyright incorporates the right to copy and *distribute* the content. This side-by-side image contained the entire image, and was distributed in a manner not approved by WU. 
Granted, I think it's dumb, because if I shared a link or image of the exact WU ad (without the Bitcoin contrast), then I could technically be in violation of copyright, but because I'd be promoting their product, they wouldn't give a shit.
This seems to only be an issue because a competitor was adjacent.

And I *still* have no idea how the stuff works. I'm trying, though.

Are they not giving them their money? Because that would be larceny, which *is* illegal.
@_date: 2014-12-11 08:25:03


And sent. Hope your son enjoys using Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:21:39
Wish I had been able to pay with Bitcoin. No worries. I still helped reddit be awesome.

Oh, you mean a contract of adhesion? That agreement that carries no true legal weight. That agreement?

IANAL as well, but that can depend on how the original is presented. If you had a video with your voice criticizing WU and lauding BTC, without your face, but you used these images side-by-side, you *could* be protected, as it is for information/education and criticism. 
Like a game reviewer or someone like Totalbiscuit (who doesn't do reviews) using full audio/video content of a videogame, but being allowed to provide review or critique the IP. There is a limit, of course, which is why Fair Use or Creative Commons is a tricky minefield.

Mark's a cool guy. I like Mark.
Jeff, though? Fuck Jeff.

Only if you bought it outright. If you're still under the original contract, then the phone company selling you the hardware is the proper owner.

I'm good on The Guardian and NASA. Generally speaking, it all depends on the news. I like Science Alert (their sensationalism IS starting to grow, though, as they like to source Business Insider, a very sensationalized source) PBS, and even the Wall Street Journal at times. I tend to avoid the article at first and look through the comment chains to see what the overall attitude is about the writing and content. I'll THEN read the article if everything looks good from a "societal" standpoint.
I know that a certain level of sensationalism for the title is likely, this is almost a given, because that kind of marketing tactic works. It's when the article itself is laden with horseshit editorializing, or just a lack of evidence to back up the claims. Places like Natural News feel more like propaganda than actual information. Hell, even sites that are *accurate* can sometimes feel overwhelmingly biased and sensationalized, [like this Vox article]( and it's all so very frustrating.
Oftentimes, I find myself reading an article that is well written and has a good overall thesis, but they haven't provided anything to back up their proclamation. For instance, [this article from 1999]( posted by the LA Times (about the "racism" in Star Wars: A Phantom Menace) is well written, but it's all pretty much just speculation and begging the question, with no facts about actual racism in the movie (one can interpret any movie to be racist if they try hard enough). 
Mostly, I'll say this: if a URL has a word that is equal or similar to "truth", "natural", "facts", or has some kind of "activism oriented" URL, I'm going to avoid it. I've been burned too many times from those sources, and felt like it was a waste of my time trying to trudge through their biased position. It sucks, too, because it's good to get both sides of the story, to get a better - more informed - opinion of the content being discussed.

I'd rather go to a website that actually has a reputation for accuracy and a lack of sensationalist garbage. Link me to those places. Don't make me trudge through shit to find a shovel.

This myth has been perpetuated ad nauseum, just like that fucking "evolution of man" nonsense, as well as the "flavor spots of the tongue" photo. 
Keep on doing the good fight!

No. Any other assumptions you'd like to make about me, or would you rather have an actual discussion?
