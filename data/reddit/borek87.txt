Sure... put out some more steam... I had 15 years once... like 2 decades ago... Girlfriend left ya' pal? Don't blame her.... She had a GOOD reason......

Wow... ok Thank you for the DEFINITIVE answer...  God bless you! (I mean if you belive in God.. personally as an atheist I would not count on it.... )
And to be all serious... So the wnswer is: If the cost is high enough people will STOP mining so the transactins will STOP so the bitcon trade will STOP so in will DIE and be WORTHLESS???

First of all THANK YOU... deeply for such a response. You may not believe it but I read through it all... most of it (95%) was just... duh I know it... I mean.. I'm a European...  For one I know what money is and that is BS and two I know why bitcoin (blockchain) is so damn compelling - and I approve it! But.... the reserve HAS the gold.... and the people HAVE the money.... and they vcan ALWAYS trade it... bitcoin... when the last one is drwan... when the sustainablility of the chain dies... it dies too right? So the Bitcoin... dies........ ? Right??? Again... I'm not doing any drama,.... I have 00000 coins.... I just want to KNOW...

As far as ASIC processors shrink with Moore's law... what if they don't (which they don't)? And energy cost is still growing at sustainable rate year after year?

 Just to be sure... if he is saying "fees" he means.... the cost of sustaingin the chain? Or mining? Which are basicaly the same? Or some arbitraty fee taken by some 3rd party comapny? Again.... I mean I know my fare share but from what he siad it's like "yes the bitcoin will die and be worthelss by 2140"...

By the way... does that nubers cout in the increasing number of cost per WATT per year? Cuz' if not that is going to happen A LOT sooner....

I ran Fedora multiple times. Previosly my favourite was Debian but since I ran many Virtual Boxes and Fedora WS comes with NO SHIT (like 99% of Linux distros with stupid games and shit you don't use) but with Docker I really like it... I'm using both with Windows though... Need Photoshop and Illustrator for designing so... anyway.,.. Fedora IS sweet...  Oh... if you meant ferdora a a woman.. I am married with a hottie 10 times hotter than I deserve and have a 7 year old kid with her that is adorable as fuck :) Good day sir... I know I will with my family....
PS. Oh... almost missed your question sorry.... As a married man regardless what you have been told about marriage I have sex average every other day... And I'm always guaranteed to have it with the best chick in the Town... :)

Yes but what does "supporting" mean... I mean you can only TRANSFER it if there is a chain right? So peaople have to mine right? So... if the cost is so high they can not... you can not transfer it right? If you can not.... well.... if you could not transfer/trade gold it would be worth 0$/10000000000 TONS!!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:03:41
Input and output... so.... the $ for mining for the sell valuer right?

If you saw one of the biggest ASIC miners in china supporting your bitcoin chain you would shit your ass if only a thought went through you mind that it could get shut donw. It probably get's like 50% of the transactions crunched.... It's bigger than several air landing fields...
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:23:11
I don't get it... If you don't want to answer my genuine question why the fuck do you bother to write at all? I mean... I do this for science/knowledge....  are you just so bored or stupid or both to answer questions that 1. you do not have answer to, 2. are such an ass in doing so? I mean... go for a walk, search for cat memes if you like (I mean I hate them, but then my IQ is far over that but you seems like a person who wouldn't mind them) I mean... do something useful...
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:25:09
Thank you I'm sure gonna read it all but could you give me a gist?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:07:49
Will it? I mean... the dificulty goes up.... A LOT.... the mining return goes down A LOT.... the cost of power goes up A LOT... really? Efficient?
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:59:31
Fees? What fees? Are fees liek some 3rd party shit or just fees like per kWh for mining fees? Cuz if so... did anyone count that in 4 years (and so on) we will pay +25% on the gas/coal/power?

So.... at this stace is someone has to hold them... someone HAS to loose.... so it's jsut a matter of... "hope it's not me..."...
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:41:29
W8 what? So "fees" are another "fee" on the part that you already paid hundereds of $$$  on crunching the transaction???? Is it's a fee... on a fee.... ona... you know what... at that point I am glad that I have a free debit card after 3 transactions a month at my bank... I thought they were steeling from me... An may I ask... who is getting this money that gets "missing"? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:28:34
Yes.... the unlock and relock between 2 entities IS a transaction... 
PERSON 1 - X
PERSON 2 + X
Anyway... regardless what you call it.... you said it... it.s a blockchain... you make a RECORD... (let's call it taht) waht happens when no one wants to hold records? Transactuions dies? Bitcion is... what... nothing?
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:56:06
Ok but... Jeeez... Ok let's make it simple - hipothetical... Kim Joh Un throwed a nuke with a "sleepy-sleepy" gas... We all went to sleep for 100 years... now it's 2140 the miners... dunno how but for the sake of argiment let's say they kept digging.... so now what? No one wants to mine cuz like a 1kWh costs like 100$ and transations can not be made so 1  bitcoin is woth 0$ right?
