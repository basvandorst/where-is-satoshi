Amazon Glacier does it for 1cent/GB, your retrieval is just delayed a few hours. I use Arq to back up my files, it connects to S3 or Glacier and is encrypted.

I don't want to reread it right now, but I thought they started with his name, found a guy whose background fit, and then went from there - so they probably searched him online, etc, and found posts about trains.

I don't understand how this works. The blog post is kind of like "just click this button and send us Bitcoin and your order is placed" - but I don't get what goes on here. If I go to the "My Orders" part of Amazon, everything will show up there and I can track it, etc.?
Also the whole business model makes me nervous.. "well we use some algorithms but they're not exact so we make some money" is weird - what algorithms are you using to get discounts on Amazon, I don't get that at all? If you said "Listen, we get a 5% affiliate fee on most stuff from Amazon, and we pass 4% of that along to you" I'd go sure, that's cool, great.

Never assume people are doing the right thing when it comes to backups/security. You'll be disappointed 90% of the time.

I've written, and read, a couple of blog posts about the identity of Satoshi, and while this theory may not be correct, or conclusive, it's the best one I've read. So many of them are horrible and just grasping at straws/seeing things.
I'd like to see the pure data on this one, and I wouldn't bet huge money on whether it's right, but it's at least not as spurious as a lot.
All the people saying they don't care who Satoshi is and never want to know: I admire the pride you take in having no curiosity, but I don't understand you at all. It's one of the last real mysteries left on the internet, and it's interesting as hell. Teach me your zen-like powers of apathy, I want to apply them to my love of cookies and cake.

I think it has confused a lot of us that the porn industry hasn't jumped all over Bitcoin, you'd think they'd be some of the earliest adopters, but what I've heard a few times is that porn companies thrive on recurring (and hard to cancel) subscriptions, and they're not interested in 1-time customers.
