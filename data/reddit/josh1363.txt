that's not how collect calls work lol. you have to agree to accept the call AKA accept to pay for the transaction

the coins that i mine will still increase over time. and with a lifetime contract it seems impossible for me to not get a better outcome longterm. I know the contract expires if it's no longer profitable, but i don't see that happening anytime soon

it also doesn't take price fluctuation of litecoin into account. It's a good estimation for your return in USD. I get what your saying about the decreasing payouts, but it's not always decreasing, it goes up and down sometimes day to day, other times week to week.

i used the bitcoin mining contract not litecoin. i just chose to get paid in litecoin. if you want to get one now i recommend monaro over ethereum. but they're only two year contract, not lifetime. still profitable though

it's 0.03

well i've earned $170 back from my $315 investment in a bit under 3 months. so i should be profiting in about 2 months from now. a 5 month ROI ain't bad :)

well it does give them access to immediate funds rather then waiting. by your logic no one would get bank loans because you have to payback more then you borrow
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:25:32
yeah, so genesis owns a massive mining farm, and you can buy a portion of the power and get payouts daily. right now i'm getting paid 0.03 Litecoin each day. that's from a $315 investment, which i bought in mid june

genesis mining. my discount code is GoRxXj :)

I'm 3 months into cloud mining. cost me $315. I'm making roughly $2.10 a day
@_date: 2017-09-09 00:09:15
With the Antminer L3+ i should get 51 days ROI
@_date: 2017-09-10 06:32:46
at the moment i am getting 0.03 litecoin per day, and this is three months after starting mining. also your acting like it expires in one year. it's a lifetime contract
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:53:09
Ok, thanks for the help. would this strategy apply more for short term trading? because i plan on buying 1 bitcoin and holding on to it for ages ;)
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:28:38
wait i'm ignorant as f, what's next week?
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:27:30
what's the reasoning for buying little amounts?
@_date: 2017-06-24 23:10:32
first, second, third and last
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:17:33
nah man you read the contract wrong. the fees are taken from the PROFIT, if the contract becomes unprofitable due to mining difficulty they will cancel the contract and refund you for the difference between how much you made and how much you paid. not really a scam at all. and you're able to mine coins (stratis and litecoin for example) that could potentially be worth much more in the future, meaning that a so called $1 profit a day, would turn into $20 that you mined in the past.

I've had $375 worth of ether mining power and so farad out .06 ether which is about $25 (and on some of those days i was mining half bitcoin half ether so probably about $30 worth of coins). also difficulty isn't trending down, there were three days in a row where i got 0.0051 then 0.0055 then 0.0053
@_date: 2017-06-24 04:10:04
no, because mining is a one time payment. it's just a matter of time before you break even. then after that it's all profit
