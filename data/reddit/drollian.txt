You could assume that when you purchase 13,411 miners you will pay less than 3499$ a piece.

I want to see how something works for myself before I consider putting money into it. Also I'm a comp sci student and I'm interested in crypto, mining and supporting the network.


It's basically giving money to someone for shilling your coin. The better someone does it the better the tip is. It's a snowball system.
I'm not saying bitcoin should be more like dogecoin, I'm saying dogecoin is doing some things bitcoin should take a look at because they are obv working.
@_date: 2014-02-04 13:41:25
Well I thought there might be a few companys doing it different. 
This kind of thinking will lead inevitably to a mining monopole (or cartel).
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:37:49
Double spend bitcoins in a bitcoin casino and when they lose they double spend it, getting the money back.
Look, when you bet 1000 bitcoins that are worth 75$ you make 75k $ and you may lose all your customers - thats a bad thing because in the business they are doing 75k is not much. That situation was when BTCGuild had more than 51%.
Well, now if you bet 1000 bitcoins you make a Million dollars (when you win f.e. a black/red roulette bet), do this a few times and you easily win 10 million. You can do this and cash out faster than anyone noticing.
So even if they make 500k/year they could make 20x times that in an hour and run away with the money.
Do you trust some random guys you don't know to not do this?
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:35:56
How is this noticed? Would the blockchain fork or what would happen?
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:01:50
Can you tell me where do you got that information? Because I thought it would take a little time until someone notices.
@_date: 2014-01-04 22:25:38
I would say the main reason is you need luck to find a block and when youre on a small pool you can have days where you arent finding any block and then you have days where you find 2 blocks at once, with more miners on a pool the range between finding a block and not finding a block gets lower because you find more blocks in general (like 5 a day or something like that) and the payout is more steady.
If it goes on like that (less and less blocks are found) people are switching to bigger and bigger pools to have a more steady payout but while doing so they are destroying the security of the btc network
@_date: 2014-01-04 23:19:11
The more bitcoin becomes worth the higher is the risk of someone wanting to make profits out of fucking up shit.
Its a different motivation if you can make 75$ or 100.000$ by cheating the network
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:43:05

Thats a good idea. I fear of doing that because my family is completly computer illiterate.
I think they will never be able to get those btc from that paper wallet...

I'm thinking the same but you can't deny that it does look bad right now. 
I mean it could be that everybody is just riding the Bad News wave and spreading fud to get cheap coins but this becomes more unlikely with every minute that gox is offline.

I made the gox account when btc was worth 75$ and it tooks 2 weeks indeed.
The fee was higher because the price suddenly spiked and the fee wasn't adjusted for a few weeks. It was like 30 or 50 cent back then.
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:15:47
well the difference is this time you can 10x more money by cheating the network
@_date: 2014-01-05 00:15:11
How does the bitcoin value matter? Cheat the system - payout before anyone notice - run away with the money - dont care about btc value anymore

Currently discussed here

13,411,788 gh/s current network hash rate
1000 gH/s = $3499 (CoinTerra TerraMiner II)
(13,411,788 / 1000) * 3499$ = 46.927.846,21 $
~50 million to gain &gt;51% of the network hashrate
The website "coinometrics" is adding the possible loss you make when not mining and selling the coins you can make with that setup.
It is not assuming someone does just want to destroy the integrity of the network (like a Bank or another competition might want to do), the cost of that is ~50m.
Quote from the Website: We assume all mining participants are rational actors and strictly pursue profit maximization. We ignore all other motivations, including political, emotional, and reputational. All other heuristics and biases are ignored.

Yeah I understand now how fees work and you're right about the bloated blockchain - I hope there will be a better solution to this problem than just highering the fees....
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:51:33


I understand that. Now pls recognize my argument that it could be any currency, not just $, and if a goverment would have bananas as a currency you would have to trade it for bananas first before buying the lambo. I just don't see where this matters at all in the discussion. Bitcoin wants to take the power away from the goverment, of curse it's not a legal currency that's one of its features. Whats the point of your argument? It doesn't need to be a legal currency.
\&gt;  they buy bitcoins with dollars, hold those bitcoins(meaning less bitcoins are circulating in the economy, which can be bad for a currency) until future price levels increase.
It's not like [fiat money]( it's more like [hard money]( On one side you have a possible infinite supply of fiat money around the whole world vs a finite amount of 21 Million bitcoins.  Monetary value with a fixed suppy is likely to always go up but with fiat the additional value is stolen by banks.
You literally don't want free money (monetary value) because some bankers wrote up a bullshit story to convince you that it's good for you to give them your money.
It's ok to wait 3 years before you spend your money. Whats bad about that? Why do we need to stimulate the economy NOW under the condition that we all lose a shitload of buying power?
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:04:43
Its just wrong, look at bitcoin, it doubles every few years and still people are spending them instead of ONLY holding them, how does that fit into your theory?
You are just talking about well studies assumptions but we can see my argument in action in bitcoin.
If your argument would be true people wouldn't spend ANY bitcoin.
You can't eat money, you can't fly with it somewhere, you can literally only hold or spend it.
Nobody wants to hodl until death and never buy anything thats not how things work
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:58:56

It depends on how you define "working so far"

Politician: I have an Idea, let's inflate the monetary suppy and devaluate the savings of people for the sake of stable prices.
You: well, now with the 500$ I have I can buy a refrigerator or I can wait a bit and buy it for 250$. 
Politician: Yes but with inflation we steal the 250$ of additional value from you so you can always buy the refrigerator for 500$.
You: Wow nice thanks for that, you have such a high IQ
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:11:20
Not necessary but let's pretend it was like this. Why does this change anything? It could be euros too or if you find someone who takes bananas you could take bananas to buy the lambo.
If someone would take a stinking pile of garbage you would also just buy the stinking garbage pile and then give it away as fast as possible. The fact that nobody wants the garbage doesn't make the garbage any better as a medium of exchange.

Wrong. There are literally people driving around with lambos with "bitcoin" written on the licence plate. You can call them idiots but they sold their btc. What do you say about that? It's direct evidence that I'm right.

Because they want to buy in cheaper

The whole cannabis seed market is based on it.
In general - everytime you don't want the sender of a packet to know who you are and you don't want to send cash in a letter then bitcoin is for you.
You don't came across it as a payment option because don't buy the right stuff. Always ask yourself: why should someone spend "good money" (btc) instead of his bad money (fiat)? There must be a valid reason.
In some businesses they need to use it every day.
You just have no clue. Like a normie in a room full of nerds.
@_date: 2019-08-02 23:51:38


Of course but if the Value rises 10x and people spend only 20% of it, which isn't much, then they would have spent more than double of what they could have spent using fiat money.
I think you are the one who needs to go back to scool here buddy.
@_date: 2019-08-02 23:42:39


Bitcoin wants nothing, it's a neutral piece of software.


It doesn't, the opposite will happen, people will have more value to spend. The spending of each earned coin just shifts a few years but in long run this doesn't matter. 
Look: If you have 100 trillion transactions a year and you do every transaction every year 3 later you will still have 100 trillion transactions. You dont get this do you?
You maybe think "LOL YOU JUST DONT UNDERSTAND" but I think it's completly retarded to think that everybody will live on the street and no one would buy a house ever and everybody will just eat stuff from the garbage bin just because the value of their currency rises so they can die rich. Thinking like this has nothing to do with reality and you have to be completly deluded if you think this will happen.

No, I want falling prices.


I really apprecheate this conversation. I had a lot like them.
Imagine this scenario: You have bitcoins for 1000$, you are holding them for 3 Years. Let's say you now have 10.000$. Since you now have 10x the amount of money you are more likely to spend some. 
But bitcoin rises in value you don't want to sell all of them. So you just spend 2.000$ worth of btc. You've now stimulated the economy more than 100% of what you could have done with fiat. The stimulus argument works only if you look at prices for a couple of weeks or months.
It's unrealistic to think people wont spend their money. They have to spend it for rent food etc.
Your (maybe) next argument will be: "What if everybody stops buying btc" it's just the same as saying "what if everyone stops using yen" it's unrealistic.
But what are we actually doing here? We are just making assumptions about how people would behave in specific cases - I think nobody of us is completly right. We just have an educated guess, it's not more than our opinion. 
I don't want to be on the side that guesses that if money loses value is the best for all of us, sry. It just doesn't make sense to give all the value that is generated each year +~2% to bankers instead of the people. I don't know how you even can remotly think its a good thing. It fucks us right in the butt bro.
