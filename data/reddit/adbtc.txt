After watching how a lot of adspaces just sit unused for days and weeks, we decided to think about a functionality that could change that.
Something that would allow publishers to win while waiting someone to pick their adspace and advertise on it. So we thought, why not be able to advertise on all unused adspaces? That could actually be a very powerful advertising campaign, as it will use our whole advertising network.
**How do adflows work?**
Let's say you have a 468x60 banner and want to advertise your site for maximum 0.0002 BTC per unique click. Except these two, you pick your total budget for the campaign and immediately see how many adspaces that fit your criteria are free at that moment.
Then you can proceed to the payment, after which your campaign starts immediately. It can be very powerful as your banner will be shown on many adspaces at the same time.
Whenever someone clicks on your banner, the price for the click is deducted from your budget and added to the adspace revenue.
**What if there are more adflows running?**
All running adflow campaigns have equal share of the adspace. So if there are 3 adflows that fit in a specific adspace, each of them will be shown 1/3 of the time on average.
**When do the publishers get their revenue?**
The revenue is payed out automatically on every 0.01 BTC.
With the implementation of the adflows, we hope to provide even more efficiency for both advertisers and publishers.
**You can try the adflow campaigns by creating one from here -
