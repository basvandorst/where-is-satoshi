the value of other currencies is stable. bitcoin value changes so much that it is more of a gamble/risky investment rather than a currency. the value of my dollars has never dropped $200 overnight so well leave it at that ;)
and as i said in another comment: "i can buy anything with real money. there is nothing exclusively available to buy with bitcoins, except illegal drugs (very bad)."

he forgot a lot of things. i have not seen propaganda this insanely over the top since hitler.
first off, 7 billion potential bitcoin users? HAH yeah right maybe this privileged hipster who made this "infographic" has a smartphone, internet access, and thousands of dollars to gamble away on what is essentially a "meme-currency", but did he ever think that the 7 billion population also includes; children (who shouldn't be gambling), people who don't have internet access, and people without smartphones. but no, this genius thinks 7 billion people should all use bitcoin!
this is Mormonism of the highest degree

actually to correct you, bitcoin is the currency for criminals. used by drug dealers and hackers on dodgy websites, its the most unsafe currency out there. you'll never catch me with those meme coins.
@_date: 2014-03-11 10:38:19
wow a scammer game company teaming up with a dodgy meme coin this is dumb news
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:19:51
bit coin is a pyramid scheme and your at the bottom

mfw when bit coins are useless

LOL ! this meme coin business is nothing more than a phase. do you seriously believe that bit coin will be used by people who arent drug dealers, criminals, etc? no respectable person uses bit coins. i feel sorry for people who have invested so heavily into this digital currency scam, especially people who have used their or their family's savings. youll never catch me with those meme coins, ill stick to actual money ;)
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:49:02
yep, but i get down votes because people are too brain washed to handle the truth. they've invested REAL money into these meme coins and cant accept that they've basically spent money for a little number on their screen with no real value. its really sad and i feel sorry for the people and their families who have bought into this scam.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:23:36
it looks like a guide to dishonesty and criminal behaviour and i want no part of that. the bitcoin users are the real criminals here

yes and it was removed from this subreddit.com because bitcoin is just a meme currencyChicken Run is a comedy escape drama with a touch of passion set on a sinister Yorks chicken farm in 1950s England.

that's trouble. there needs to be a link from bitcoin back to who bought it. we all know that people arent buying bitcoin to pay for food or groceries, the only people who buy bitcoin are buying drugs with it. we need a link back to the person who bought the bitcoins, so we can deal with them accordingly.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:00:29
the public doesnt need to know about bitcoin. no normal person has any interest in internet "meme coins". are you a drug dealer or a criminal? then bitcoins might be for you, but no one wants to use a digital currency where the price is constantly changing. bit coin is the most embarrassing thing to ever happen on the internet, and its a fad i hope dies out very soon. people are losing their own and their families money over a little number on a screen which in the end is worth nothing. theres never been a problem with real money, theres no reason to get into this dodgy meme coin business
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:35:05
because people are realising that this whole meme coin business is the stupidest idea ever. real money always has and always will be the best currency to use LOL
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:12:35
i dont get it is this a meme or something ?
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:07:06
i warned you guys that bit coin would crash and no one believed me 
i guess this proves that meme coins are unreliable ;)
@_date: 2013-12-23 12:39:14
dont buy bitcoins! even though its a popular meme on reddit now its very bad and you will lose money trust me
@_date: 2013-12-29 17:50:30
That's because it takes twice as much work as perseverance.
@_date: 2013-12-29 15:18:51
you wait in 1 year ill be back and show u how much the value has lost and i invested all my money in compost so ill be rich
@_date: 2013-12-29 14:36:04
no because bitcoin is just a stupid meme currency which will be dead by end of 2014 no 1 will use it
