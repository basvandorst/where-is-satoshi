Don't you mean using his money to bully Martin Eberhard, the real founder of Tesla and who was creating the cars, into leaving the company then trying to claim himself as the founder? Yes, clearly a decent human.

Of course. I was just using it as an analogy to compare someone saying they're going to Mars vs actually having the means to do it.
Now, can we please get off of these tangential arguments and focus on what I've been trying to say all along:
**Elon Musk stole Tesla Motors from Martin Eberhard and claimed to be the founder**.
Let me repeat that:
 Musk stole Tesla Motors from Martin Eberhard and claimed to be the founder
Now if anyone can provide evidence to refute this claim, please do so. I'm tired of answering all these straw mans.

Sources? Of course I have sources:
Yes. Eberhard literally sued Musk and Tesla for Musk's claims to being the founder. If you took the time to read that, it is clear that there is a lot of shady stuff going on.
Also, some more reads if you're looking for the truth:

Wow. This right here ladies and gentlemen is the argument refuting that **Elon Musk stole Tesla Motors from Martin Eberhard and claimed to be the founder**. I can only assume you're trolling with that comment.
Don't you find it hypocritical that you required me to post sources of my stance (which I did), but you don't have any sources to back up your claim?

Besides the fact that you're ignoring the argument of Musk stealing the title of founder (classic goalpost shifting), it was Musk who was on the sidelines. After all, Eberhard was the CEO for four years before being booted out. You should read the other link I posted: 




If you keep reading, it's clear that it was actually Musk that was jealous of Eberhard's success. If it really was Eberhard on the sidelines, Musk wouldn't have needed to forcefully boot Eberhard out of the company. Also, did you read the part where Musk ignored the agreement to give Eberhard the second Roadster, then gave him the third Roadster only after it crashed? Gee, Musk sure is a nice person.
Okay, fine. I'll attack the Mars strawman that you gave me. First of all, how am I going to attack an argument where the argument is "planning to put humans on Mars"? Yes, I'm sure he's planning on putting people on Mars, but saying that vs doing that are not the same thing. Did you hear about Mars One. They planned on going to Mars. Didn't happen. Even if they had a rocket to go to Mars, there are just so many things left unsolved that make the Mars mission so difficult. How do we shield the astronauts from radiation? How do we prevent bone loss from extended space travel to Mars? And many other questions!
But wait, he actually wants to colonize Mars! Believe me, I'm all for colonizing other planets but we're just not there yet and claiming to be able to do this without having first solved the main problems is not promising. I know the argument of colonizing is so that in case there is a world-wide apocalypse, we still have humans left. However, with a colony that will need regular supplies to survive, if that were to happen the people on Mars are going to soon die off in a world that makes Antarctica look like a paradise. If you want my opinion on this, the whole colonization things is a hyperbole used to get people to invest in SpaceX. They're sure going to need funding after missing the target of the last $500 million funding round, not getting the contract for the Lucy mission, and being left out of the air force's next-generation rocket program.
