c-lightning can be run with a pruned node. 
edit: do note that it's not really officially supported and there's still some problems with it, such as fetching UTXOs that reside in blocks past the pruned point.

You could do it in one transaction: buy one $700 Gyft gift card and then use that to buy the rest of the gift cards.

No problem -- lightning is so attractive it was hard _not_ to list it as an option :D

Check your logs, they should give a clearer view of what's happening. I've successfully closed many channels (on both testnet and mainnet)


No. I'm not an expert on the subject, but it sounds to me like if it's stuck on that status something may have gone wrong getting a valid signature for the closing transaction, your funds may have went into a timelocked transaction -- the logs should clarify this (it should be tracking the transaction) -- if you leave your node running it's likely that it will take the appropriate action and send the funds to an output you can immediately spend (and it should show up under the `listfunds` command) once the timelock is up.


Don't worry about that too much. Stop by the  channel on freenode IRC or create an issue on github and someone with more expertise will see and help you.

We're running c-lightning on the backend, utilizing lightning charge to create invoices and some custom scripts that work with it to notify us of payment.

Hey, this is pretty awesome! We had a very similar idea a couple of years ago and actually wrote some software and started up a website around it.
I love when people have similar ideas independently ;)
Not really trying to self promote or anything but I think it's unavoidable if you want to actually see it: 
The ones up there are a bit different, but I made some circular ones like you have for private use as well.

That's what crossed my mind as well.

In Satoshi We Trust LLC (myself and are proud to present Walletgenie. Walletgenie is a CLI RPC frontend to digital currency daemons written in Python and runs cross-platform. This means you need to be running your own Bitcoin and (optional) Counterparty node for this to benefit you. We currently support Bitcoin-Core and Counterparty-Server, but have designed the program to be modular so that more coin daemons can be added. Feel free to contribute a plugin for your favorite coin.
Walletgenie has ShapeShift integrated, so you can shift Bitcoin and supported Counterparty assets directly from the wallet. Our goal is to support most if not all of the ShapeShift supported assets.
It also has Lets Talk Bitcoin! username lookup support for verified Bitcoin/Counterparty address. We also plan to support netki.com and openname.com name lookup as well.
Current Features:
* Communicates with RPC daemon(s) on local machine or via network.
* Plugin design for multi-coin support. Currently supports Bitcoin-Core and Counterparty-Server.
* ShapeShift integration. Shift Bitcoin and supported Counterparty assets right from your wallets.
* Lets Talk Bitcoin! username lookup support for verified Bitcoin/Counterparty address.
lots of plans to make this better, we will be adding to it gradually -- we are also open to pull requests!

You're correct on both fronts. I whole-heartedly agree about supporting BIP32, I will put that on the todo.
You're right it doesn't do anything that bitcoind CLI can't (and I suppose it really never will) -- we wrote it to make using bitcoind on the CLI a little easier -- you don't have to remember the names of the commands or the parameters because walletgenie provides a narrative interface (what address do you want to send to, how much, etc.). 
Remembering what the commands are when you're running a lot of different coins can be a chore. I personally ran into this issue a lot when using bitcoin and especially counterparty on a VPS (so CLI is the only option) -- I had a bunch of little scripts running around with the different commands listed out to do what I wanted and I would just modify the scripts when I wanted to do something. Walletgenie makes that much easier!

You have things backward. First there was no data allowed for OP_RETURN. Then it was raised to 40 bytes. After discussions it was raised to 80 bytes.
Counterparty was never "obsoleted" by any OP_RETURN limitations. You can encode counterparty transactions utilizing other schemes as well, so OP_RETURN is not even necessary.

I don't think they are ugly. Actually, I think some of the combinations look pretty good.
I respect the fact that you and others may have that opinion though. We would like to eventually integrate more variations for background templates (even specific templates for certain coins).
@_date: 2014-10-03 01:30:37
Regarding your first concern, I would head over to [ and download their code to make yourself up some encrypted wallets. We maintain a list of generators / decrypters [in our FAQ](


Absolutely! At the moment this is a manual process however. In order to get copies you just have to choose multiple wallets and use the same data for each(through the multi-order or bulk-order forms)


At the moment we do not allow removing of the 'In Satoshi We Trust'  part. In the future we plan to incorporate more background templates and at that point we may allow it. Using the bulk order functionality allows you to have different wallets for all of the different entries.
If you want to order 10 wallets or less, I would recommend you to use the Multiple Wallet order function (it has a simpler UI at the moment, I have plans to rework the CSV section somewhat).


Could you expand on what you mean / why you want to do this? [BIP38wallets.com]( is entirely HTTPS. When you upload an image / csv file to our website, the transmission *is* encrypted.
@_date: 2014-10-30 18:04:15
We actually do *not* generate the paper wallet for you. You are paying us to print your information on durable synthetic paper (which is waterproof, greaseproof and tearproof) in a customizable fashion. We allow you to upload custom art and generally customize the wallet to your liking (with new art and features being added regularly). All of the wallets that we print are done with an [HP Indigo 5600 Press]( onto [Nekoosa SynapsOM]( synthetic paper.
@_date: 2014-12-14 23:15:32
Hell, we at [BIP38wallets]( post a wallet (with BIP38 encrypted private key) with [1 BTC]( in it [for all to see!](
@_date: 2014-10-31 02:32:09
Yes, this is definitely possible (actually, [here's a nice thread talking about it]( 
You can create as many paper wallets as you need and combine all of the public keys to generate a multisig address. You can then print the individual key pairs (with BIP38 encrypted private keys) onto X amount of individual paper wallets, and each one will be required to send funds from the created multisig address.
@_date: 2014-10-30 18:23:36
No problem, thanks for your interest!
@_date: 2014-10-04 19:35:35
I'm happy to announce that we have added a feature to allow customers to choose if they want the 'In Satoshi We Trust' slogan to appear on the wallets or not. I can appreciate your issue with having it on there.
We have also re-worked our CSV order form a bit to make it more simple to work with.
Thanks very much for your feedback!

I operate [BIP38wallets.com]( with my business partner and we are both very excited about Counterparty and the possibilities it opens up. 
We have created our own asset ([BIPWALLET]( which can be bought with a variety of crypto-currencies and then redeemed directly for our paper wallets. They can also be traded, sold, gifted, etcetera. (We've put up a page [here]( that explains a bit about counterparty and our asset if you want to read about it)
I think that this is an awesome ability that has only recently become a possibility and I wanted to put it out there. I'm very much looking forward to seeing how it works out in the long run.
In case anyone wants to get a couple, I've created a special *buy 3 BIPWALLET get 1 free* with the promo code **BTCREDDIT** for you guys. The promotion is good through November 5 at 3:59 am MST
**edit** (10/31 5:15): Our counterpartyd servers are both experiencing a [known bug]( with the new v45 code and it has been taking our site offline throughout the day [and blockscan too]( The bug causes continuous blockchain reorganization loops on random blocks. We are working diligently to keep the server online, but we expect it to be up and down until counterparty fixes the issue. It is marked as a priority bug, so I assume it is being addressed as quickly as possible. Thanks for your patience and understanding.
If you experience any trouble with a transaction, please contact us at contact for assistance.
@_date: 2014-10-31 01:31:50
Could you expand on that a bit? I would most definitely consider doing such a thing, but I'm not sure exactly what you mean. You could print two different wallets each with one of 3 keys (but I don't think that's what you meant). Did you mean more of an each wallet contains a portion of a private key?
@_date: 2015-05-06 16:33:02


That's a very fallacious way of defining success given the subject at hand. I'd define success as: does it work or not? And the answer is yes, much better than a VPN -- if for only the reasons petertodd outlined above.

Would you mind expanding on why you believe that would be a better option? 
I run rpcssl on some of my machines and have never had an issue. Easiness of that vs. ssh tunnel is subjective (It's literally just adding a couple of options in your bitcoin config).
Also, I'd just like to take the opportunity to point out here that the Bitcoin wiki page on enabling the rpcssl option currently points to a page that reads "JSON-RPC over SSL is strongly discouraged" with no explanation whatsoever: [ It was edited this way on [April 23 by Phantomcircuit]( undoing the page gavinandresen had built up (which I thought was well done). I brought this up in  a while back but nothing came of it. The [talk page]( has a similar inquiry.

            return True
        except:
            return False
    
    for t in BASE58_ALPHABET:
        k = key
        ks = '{}{}{}'.format(k[ : -2], t, k[-1])
        for tt in BASE58_ALPHABET:
            ks = '{}{}'.format(ks[ : -1], tt)
            if is_key_valid(ks):
                print 'VALID KEY: {}'.format(ks)

Well, the Bitcoin logo is the only one that is naturally tilted. I actually didn't alter any of the logos and kept them in their natural orientation for making the posters up. But I can see what you mean about it being the only one haha, kind of sticks out!
@_date: 2015-03-29 21:10:40
It varies depending on how much you order (the site calculates it for you, and you do get discounts if you order more), but for a single poster the shipping would be about $10.07 to Australia.

I was actually just trying myself to independently verify it and likewise it is failing (even the base64 option comes back with a "bad first byte"). I did sign from counterwallet though, so I will try to import and sign from the QT wallet.

We've just started offering our custom cryptocurrency and math based posters on [ Each poster is composed of text as returned by the getblock API call that can be customized to start from a block of your choosing -- with the idea being you can commemorate that big moment in Bitcoin history with the text describing the block in which it happened -- forming a nice looking, unique poster that also holds useful information!
