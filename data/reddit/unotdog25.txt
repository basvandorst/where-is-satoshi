Sorry this is the point i was making in relation to him thinking they would charge a large premium. Even if they didn't use a psp like biopsy that charge a flat 1% fee, the small charge or premium they would pay would offset risks of a chargeback. So I totally agree with you.

To save space in transactions Bitcoin was designed so that any amount entering a transaction not spent as an output to the destination/destinations or as a change output would be considered the fee. 
If you're manually creating a transaction and you forget to create a change output, the remaining amount is considered the fee.

This is the chronic lack of liquidity that Bitcoin suffers from, it's the same in the opposite direction. It's also why market cap is a terrible metric so easily manipulated when so many people refuse to put their coins on exchanges.

It's a great question to ask, and it shows you're actually understanding something. 
Believe it or not there is actually a limited number of Bitcoin addresses. There's just so many that provided you use enough entropy (randomness) that the chances of you generating the same wallet as someone else is basically zero. Not zero obviously, but you could set a super computer going and in a 1000 years you would still have never found the same address as someone else. Maths is amazing. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 22:37:19
To save space in a transaction any amount without a destination address to go to is considered an implied transaction fee. The same is true when claiming a block. Fees = total inputs - total outputs.

Taking away the pools ability to choose the transactions means the pool can't perform a 51% attack? Or have I got this wrong?

You're welcome. I was in sales, retail though. Worked my way upto store manager after a few years until I quit in 2012 to trade Bitcoin. Peer to peer though, not on exchange. 
Pick something with good achievable commissions so you can really live and breathe that shut and squeeze every penny of commission like a fucking animal. You find the right job and you embrace that shit the commission can be awesome. Otherwise go for something with promotion opportunities and go in from day one with management roles as the aim. Buy into all their bullshit company ethos, procedures, all that crap. Once you get promoted to a position with manager in the title, even if its just assistant manager, the whole world opens up. Suddenly you're reliable for assistant manager roles all over the place. Dont just take the first offer either, shop around. Conpaines are dying for high quality reliable people i swear. Once you get one offer your balls will swell and you'll be able to walk into any interview knowing that you're valuable. And network with customers, the amount of opportunities I was offered by customers because I was so engaged was unbelievable. It was a customer who came in the shop who told me about Bitcoin too in early 2012, I swear to god that's the truth. 
Your £5k investment was realistically going to drop to about £3000 before the market recovers for another bull run, even if you weren't using leverage and you just held. Plenty of time to buy in before the next bull run. £5k is 5 months at minimum wage, 4 months if you get slightly more than minimum wage, and 3 months if you slay your commissions. Maybe even look at trading p2p on localbitcoins, there's good money in trading there if you know what to do. 
Good luck anyway. Feel free to update me in a years time when you're killing it again.

You can't put a value on learning a lesson like this. Don't swing trade unless you know what you're doing, and don't margin trade unless you know exactly what you're doing AND you're a degenerate. £5k in the grand scheme of things is not a big deal. It's 5 months of minimum wage. As for losing your job, there are tons of jobs in the UK at the moment, you just have to look. Moments like these either make a man or break a man. Don't let it be the latter. Do what needs to be done and make that money. Inside 2 years you could easily be spending £5k on a holiday without even thinking about it, OR, you could be a bum again and it would feel like you wrote this post just yesterday. Go out and do it. Losing £5k can be an awesome story to tell in the future, don't let it demotivate you.

I would maybe contact LB support and ask their advice. 
If he had a fraudulent transaction into his bank, you just need to make him understand that it wasn’t you, but at the same time make him understand being asked questions like this after a sale makes you uncomfortable because it sounds like something a fraudster would do. Especially since he has your ID. Wish him the best of luck dealing with the bank and assure him you will remain available for comment/contact, but divulging more information puts you at risk. Also make the point that if someone defrauded him they are unlikely to be answering questions, or even replying to his messages.  
Even if your bank gets hacked, (which it won’t, since they aren’t going to hand over control of your bank account just because he has a copy of your birth certificate), your money is protected. Don’t sweat it, fraud is rampant on LB, so it’s very plausible someone has screwed him.

The part you describe as “having your keys available” IS backing up your wallet. A wallet is a group of keys. Usually it’s backed up by a 12-24 word seed so that it can be written on paper easily by a human.

I don't think you've thought this through. Sure, they could have explained what the fee was for clearer, but what option do they have unless they close the company? You cant be paying $0.50 tx fees for free to sell those coins on when a huge portion of your business is probably sub $50 invoices. Bitpay don't have a business model unless they pass this cost to the customer, end of story. At 1% profit margins (the last I checked), they make 10 cents on a 10 dollar invoice, they cant pay a 50 cent fee to sen that coin onto the person who is buying it at the other end. Bitpay ceasing business would be very bad publicity for the whole community.

@_date: 2018-03-10 21:46:46
This is the dumbest thing I've heard Peter Todd say. There's a few reasons you can't really blame them. Firstly though, they do bullshit around by trying to suggest that they just want to consolidate outputs or something, when in reality what they are saying is: we're charging you the fee we will have to pay to send this Bitcoin on to the person who ultimately buys it.
You have to see they had no choice in adding extra fees though, since Bitpay wants to (and has to be able to in order to compete with Visa) still give people the option to buy small items. There are going to be issues while fee's are even $0.50. Bitpay's supposed profit is the 1%., that means they would only make a profit when the amount was over $50. Back when we had $20 fees that would have meant the item would have to be more than $2000 before they made a profit. You obviously understand the only option was to pass the fee along to the customer, or else they would have had to close down (This would have been very bearish news and helped no-one). They can't operate at a loss. They Should have just been clear about it instead of pussy footing around. They just need to come out and say they have no business model if they have to pay a fee to send the transaction on. Which is not their fault. It's just another reason we're always going to need something like LN.
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:10:29
Are you a degenerate risk taker? Fuck it, try it. If you have all Btc then you clearly are prepared to lose money. The problem is you need to be patient to enter a position. Don’t just decide “I’m going to do some margin trading today. Put a couple of bitcoin in bitmex and be patient. Wait for obvious moments of the market being oversold or over bought, and don’t get greedy. You hit 2% profit, you cash out, or reduce the size of your position by 50% so you can afford for the price to go against your original entry point and still cash out the same number of bitcoin. Don’t go crazy on 50-100x. 10x is plenty. I suggest a mental exercise. Whatever you have in bitmex, removes it from your portfolio. See how you feel with that new smaller portfolio. Assume you’ve already lost it. Suicidal? No? Then start gambling with 25% of your bitmex balance at a time then work upto 50%. Try to never use the full balance incase you need to add to a position.

The answers you're getting are of a slightly mocking nature because it doesn't make sense per se. 
Any one miner might only mine a block per day or per week or month. Even a huge mining pool would only control say 20% of the overall hashpower. So they would only mine about 1.2 blocks per hour on average. This would mean trying to get a confirmation within 15minutes using them would be unlikely. Basically you'd need to negotiate with the whole bitcoin network for an advantage you can already purchase with a bitcoin fee. It's not going to happen.

Mycelium. You can import individual public keys or import a master public key to see the whole wallet, including the ability to generate new public addresses from that wallet. You can import as many master public keys as you like too.

I don’t know, I’m not an expert, but as far as I understand, Bitpay charge a 1% fee to merchants for converting their Btc to fiat. Which is fair enough, so you wouldn’t expect them to be so hostile to it. Are they even hostile to it?

Since this is your first trade and you therefore have no reputation on whatever platform you found your trade partner, I wouldn’t be overly concerned if he wants you to hand over the cash before he sends the coins. I maybe have misjudged the dynamic, but I would never send coins to someone before I received the cash. Even in a bank they could just shout for help and claim you were extorting him for money, didn’t bring vehicle registration documents etc. 
If it’s a platform like LocalBitcoins that you met him on, you can send bitcoin to each other instantly and free, meaning no need to wait for confirmations. Just give your LB deposit address and ask him to send from his LB account. Saves awkward smalltalk while you wait for a confirmation.

The case can be made that they are using too high transaction fees, but I don’t think you understand how bitcoin works if you think this is an unnecessary business expense and that UTXO sweeps are unnecessary. When they say UTXO sweep, what they in reality mean is “getting the bitcoin to the person who buys them”. This is absolutely an unavoidable business expense, there’s no question about that. When it represented a small fraction of their 1% margin it was no problem, but with even 50 cent fees they literally have no business unless they pass this cost onto the customer. (Yes, they could use much lower fees to do this though). 
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:30:12

They also offer unlimited crypto deposits and withdraws, which is incredibly important because it means I don’t have to leave my crypto on exchange for fear of going over my limits. This also proves they have no solvency issues too. I wouldn’t even use another exchange.

LN wallets will be the next stage. Possibly a value added service from platforms already holding coins for customers like exchanges.

I think I’m confusing deliberately leaving blocks empty (not a 51% attack), and double spends, with a 51% attack. Would there not be possible some devolution of power to indiviadual miners that took away the ability to rearrange past transactions? Ie an individual miner would be able to detect that the pool it was in, was attempting to reverse the chain?

I saw that bit. I think it was just the way you described it as a lookup fee.
Regretfully, as much as I love a good witch hunt, there's a few reasons you can't really blame them. Firstly though, they do bullshit around by trying to suggest that they just want to consolidate outputs or something, when in reality what they are saying is: we're charging you the fee we will have to pay to send this Bitcoin on to the person who ultimately buys it. 
You have to see they had no choice in adding extra fees though, since Bitpay wants to (and has to be able to in order to compete with Visa) still give people the option to buy small items. There are going to be issues while fee's are even $0.50. Bitpay's supposed profit is the 1%., that means they would only make a profit when the amount was over $50. Back when we had $20 fees that would have meant the item would have to be more than $2000 before they made a profit. You obviously understand the only option was to pass the fee along to the customer, or else they would have had to close down (This would have been very bearish news and helped no-one). They can't operate at a loss. They Should have just been clear about it instead of pussy footing around. They just need to come out and say they have no business model if they have to pay a fee to send the transaction on. Which is not their fault. It's just another reason we're always going to need something like LN.

Oh god. It would be funny if it wasn’t so tragic. I hope you’re not one of these auts that constantly bitches on about it on your socials media account. There will come a day when it haunts you. Like the emo kids at school, you’re going to look back and wonder what on Earth were you thinking.

So how much are they using sat/byte when they comsolidate UTXOs?
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:45:12
Definitely. Completely centralised wallets and payment services will more than likely be the guise in which the majority ever interact with Bitcoin.

Fair play to the guy. He looks pretty good now. He also voluntarily came out and offered to return the billions in coins he was legally obliged to keep. If he holds to his word then I think he has earned some redemption. We have no idea how things went down, shit just gets out of hand sometimes when you end up in positions of such importance by accident.

Slow down cowboy. Counter intuitive only because the drop in the housing market and the stock market effectively wiped out about 7 trillion dollars. Without the bailout we would have seen significantly more deflation. This is hardly a controversial opinion. So while we didn't see net inflation, the bailout had an inflationary effect, which is what I said. Please again a little further if you disagree.

I just withdrew all crypto to cold storage. I'll be writing a letter to HMRC in the morning telling them I refuse to fund terrorism and all taxes will be kept safely until this terrorist government is overthrown. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:19:04
I'm not going to argue semantics. Especially when you call it "monetarist theory". What I said wasn't factually incorrect. Injecting money into an economy suffering deflation causes inflation. Inflation is the state of the money supply being inflated. Which is what happened, it caused inflation.

Haha you fucking pleb. Yea, prices are meant to rise so much it destroys purchasing power by over 96% in a 100 years. You total bellend. You clearly had a great education. All you talk is bullshit.

Bittrex has one of the highest cold wallet balances of bitcoin apparently. Second behind Bitfinex I think. I can’t find the source, but cold wallets of exchanges are releatively well know I believe.

Firstly this is blackmail. I don't think either of you have any idea how bad of a crime this is. Seriously bad. 
Second, in the UK having a bank close your account just means you're unable to open an account with then again. Possibly any of their banking partners. Itbwont appear on your credit report as far as I'm aware.
Please clarify, did he have an advert up offering to buy your coins, or did you have an advert up offering to sell coins? What country are you in? 
Also FYI if you asked for a mod already, he has already lost his LB account. When mods see his messages he will get an instant ban. It's important that you let him know before he gets banned that if he decides to carry out his threat you will be going to the police. He is threatening to cause you monetary loss. Also tell him that if anyone pulls this trick in the next 2 year's you're going to assume it's him and pursue the threats alone with the police.

Because dropping the price to $3-4k to accumulate makes their future gains way bigger. Don't believe this BS anyway. They've been buying OTC for years. The only reason this is public info is because they're trying to make you think a certain way (that the price will go up). So almost certainly the opposite will happen.

Deposited £50 yesterday to test everything out an the trading went smoothly even if the walls are a bit quiet. The website layout is nice and simple too. I wish you all the best. 
Also, when did bitcoin get recognised as a currency by the UK government? As far as I'm concerned I don't think it's happened, unless I missed the memo.
