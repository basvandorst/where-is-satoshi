...that's because you aren't using 'snapcard'.
Take time to read posts before you respond to them, please.

What even?

"Hi there, we're new in town, and we'd like to have a nice meal tonight. Would you perhaps know of a good restaurant around here somewhere?"
"This website has excellent recommendations, go there and read about a few, pick one that you're interested in!  That info is better than my advice."

They're ruining this subreddit.  Along with a bunch of other people.
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:10:56
Ademo, no.
BTC are popular because they're strong - stronger than gold or silver.  Bitcoin doesn't rely on physical goods.  It relies on math and equations, not silly things like the number of protons in an atom.
You're posting to deaf ears, nobody here gives a fuck.  This sub is shit now.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:52:49
First off:
Nobody here is going to give you a real answer.  This sub is shit now.  
To get an answer to your question:
Go to  and **read.**  Read about the markets.  And then decide for yourself.
Also:  **READ THE FAQ.**
Please don't post:  General newcomer questions, like "which client should I use?", "how do I buy Bitcoin?" - again, What to do if you see...A post from the "don't" list above - direct the posted to a proper subreddit if applicable (for questions and newbie posts), vote and report accordingly otherwise

It's not cheaper, it's be more expensive.
Guns are cheap.  They're mass produced.  A 3D printed gun would be a one-off item.  
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:45:44
Do your own research, this sub is full of trolls and morons.
There is nobody here who is going to give you an actual answer, and who also knows what they're talking about.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:22:03
We aren't going to do your homework for you, you aren't going to get any real answers here.
**Nobody knows what's going to happen for sure.**  Read up on it and formulate your own opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:48:54
lol, uh, no
This is temporary.  Nobody should feel silly.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:41:38
Just fucking google it.  'snapcard' is not food stamps. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:46:21
Paid out in bitcoin?  Talk about scamcoin...bitcoin is already over.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:26:29
...you bought bitcoins when the price is very, very high.  It's nearly at $1000 again.  Yesterday I saw it at 800 or so.
This is not going to be a retirement plan for you, especially because you only put $200 in.  You do not understand what Bitcoin is.

brrrghghghghgh okay it's just that there are a *ton* of these threads now.  It seems like it comes up multiple times per *hour* sometimes.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:17:10
No, it isn't.  It's in the FAQ.

"A 3D printer" does not mean "A 3D printer, that can print a working gun"
A standard 3D printer does not have that capability.  And it won't, for a looooong time.
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:17:55
Ha, I'm a troll?
I'm giving a serious answer.  This sub is crap now.  There is better info elsewhere.  The info is **already out there.**  If OP wants to know what exchange they should use, *they need to decide for themselves*.  It's a personal choice.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:40:39
I do, I've been studying it for years.
The equipment to make an actual 3D printed gun is RIDICULOUSLY expensive.  It won't get much cheaper over the next 20 years at least.
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:15:24


Read even more than that.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:54:16
Maybe nobody wants to buy right now?
I mean, I wouldn't.
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:25:33
So start a business, and accept BTC :)
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:58:28
I could say the same to OP.
**THIS IS COVERED IN THE FAQ.  IF OP READ THE FUCKING FAQ, THEY WOULD NOT HAVE POSTED THIS.**
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:28:28
Correct.  It's Monday morning.  Be patient.  Bank transfers are only just starting to go through.
Bitcoin works on larger timescales than 45 minutes.

wake up
wake up
wake up
