Oh baloney everyone has a number they would sell for.  Moot point anyway bc if China wanted to they could build a massive mining farm gain more than 51% and hijack the entire network at a financial loss and basically destroy btc. But again China dgaf about btc. 
So even if people wouldn't sell China could basically make it all worthless.

You want to take a loan out to speculate on the most volatile market in the history of markets at what could very well be the peak of the market for the near term?  Just get a big rock and drop it on your kneecaps now and save yourself the headache.

China owns many trillions of future us tax payer money (US Sovereign Debt) China dgaf about btc.  If China wanted to buy all of the btc in the world right now it could and would. If China wanted to build a mining farm so vast it controlled the entire network it could in a heartbeat.

It's very possible for it to lose 75% of its value in a month or none at all.  3x -3.5x Margin trading is now allowed on many exchanges. When we get another correction it could be quite steep. Guess we'll see ��

China will only make all or nothing purchases with users. But the amount will vary. Point is China ���� has fuck you money. China dgaf about btc manipulating the market to make profit.  
But people on the financial sector and reporters they might manipulate the market for personal gain.

$3,500 - we're near ATH but getting lots of bad press.  I anticipate more money being moved out of ALTs because of China locking up crypto exchanges. Any more bad news from china we continue to tumble. Plus there will be more uncertainty with the next fork coming up. Could go either way but since we're so close to the ATH I think we'll see more downward pressure than up. We need exhuberance to push more money into the market and I think there's a lot of confusion right now which can lead to fear which can lead to price dips. I imagine I'll get down-voted but. Just my 2cents. That said I think there are a lot of people waiting to dive in based on the press in general...so we may bounce pretty hard off 3k or 3500 and ride up to a new ATH. 
Furthermore - you can see how the market reacts to bad news coming out of China. At least in the short term I think it's more likely we'll get more bad news than sudden good news.
