The point is that during a majority hash rate attack the miners can't be trusted. No miner vote or "registration" changes that. So the other interest groups in the Bitcoin network have to decentrally organize by using all available communication methods like social media, chat rooms, conferences etc. and change the software they are running.
Every user has to decide for themself if the current miners are violating the protocol rules, if the current miners are violating the "spirit" of Bitcoin or if the user is only seeing an astroturfed social media campaign. Ideally the economic majority comes to an intersubjective agreement of what Bitcoin is. The old miners would then be replaced by new miners.
To be clear, proof-of-work change is called the nuclear option for good reason. It would be rather destructive because honest miner would be caught in the crossfire. But the threat has to be there to maximize the chances that majority hash rate attacks are uneconomical.

Agreed, centralized mining pools are a potential risk. However Bitcoin is the ultimate free market.
Right now when most people think about mining they think how much they could profit. But when the US government built the Fort Knox vault inside a military base it didn't think about profit at all. It only thought about the cost to secure its gold reserves.
There was already a shift from assuming on-chain Bitcoin transactions would be essentially free forever to recognizing that the Bitcoin blockchain alone can't scale in a decentralized and secure way to contain a high fraction of the monetary transactions of the world economy.
So another shift in thinking might be necessary. Users can help mining decentralization by using [p2pool.in]( to mine at a loss in the short term. In the long run it might just be what secures their wealth better. Unfortunately due to economics of scale the halfway efficient mining start up costs are rather high for now. Hopefully these come down in the future as Bitcoin grows in popularity.
At the end of the day somebody has to pay for the security of a currency. It's either mostly the savers who pay through inflation or the spenders who pay transaction fees but it could also be the miners if enough people are willing to mine at a loss. If centralized mining pools have outsized power then it was the users who granted them that power.

The 9/11 attacks were extremely inexpensive for how much wealth destruction they caused in financial markets. Yet the US and world economy and stock markets recovered relatively quickly. Right now it's already way more expensive to do a majority hash rate attack on the Bitcoin network than it is to bomb a few skyscrapers, stock markets and bank headquarters.

That would be considered an attack. The response from the community would be a proof-of-work algorithm change.

Bitcoin is a new 100%-reserve digital gold standard which has never before existed in human history. Previous gold standards were always fractional reserves and broken promises. So Bitcoin does have the potential to improve the world economy.

The Bitcoin blockchain is the longest *valid* chain. Who decides what's valid? The Bitcoin community. Full nodes can play nasty as well and not accept and not relay blocks that are not build on the controversial block. So there probably would be a stop censoring deadline to the 75% of miners, similar to BIP 148, as long as the community cares about censorship resistance. It's like a Mexican standoff. Everybody plays nice and nobody gets hurt.
The last option for the community is always a proof-of-work change. The more people in the Bitcoin community agree on a hard fork the less of a problem it is. It's only not Bitcoin if an economic minority hard forks off.
During a majority hash rate attack the miners are already devaluing everyone's investment so they might as well get fired and be replaced by new miners. Most economically relevant full nodes replacing miners gives up short term security for Bitcoin. Miners trying to replace full nodes they don't like leads to less economic relevance of their new chain.

Don't forget that the renminbi is valued at $27T and the euro at another $13T. All fiat currencies would come under pressure at the same time. Also at those valuations it would make more sense to think of Bitcoin's purchasing power in terms of goods like trillion liters of milk or as a part of gross world product rather than fiat.

The difficulty changes automatically for all compatible nodes, no matter what version they run. You can't get a lower mining difficulty by running older software.

A growing economy that uses a currency with a fixed money supply will see a long-term decline in the prices of goods and services. However growth is only achievable if capital is deployed efficiently. People just sitting on their money and waiting for other people to grow the economy do not help. So people have to realize that the only way to increase the purchasing power of their money is to take the risk of lending even at no interest rate or negative interest rate. This creates a classical prisoner's dilemma. If all other people take the risk to lend at 0% interest I can just not lend and the economy grows anyway. The risk with that is if too many people think like that there won't be any economic growth, the purchasing power of the money might even go down.
Keynesianism is all about psychological tricks to hide these facts from the hoi polloi with nominal positive interest rates while real, inflation adjusted interest rates are often zero or negative. In fact inflation adjusted interest rates are negative right now even in the USA. In addition, central banks create gigantic conflicts of interests.
So what needs to be done? People need a better economic education. Risk is necessary for economic growth and it only matters how risk is nominally depicted if people don't know what they're doing.

The response would be a proof-of-work change which causes a financial loss for the attacker. This can be repeated until the attacker is completely broke.

When commercial bank X makes a new loan it creates money out of thin air first. At the end of the business day they do have to balance the books. But what realistically happened to the loan? It probably was already sent to bank Y or eventually will be. Bank Y also needs to balance the books. So the natural transaction is that bank Y loans bank X the money back so both books are balanced. The main constraint on money creation commercial banks have is their subjective speculation on profitability.
Since you asked about qualification, the Bank of England should be qualified enough.

1) People spend money because they have needs and wants. It doesn't matter how much you like your bitcoins, if it's the only thing you have and you're hungry then spending some on food will quickly become a no-brainer. You can't take it to the grave. Stealing goods in general has its own obvious drawbacks. If you would rather save your bitcoins than buy an expensive car then the offer wasn't good enough for you. There's nothing wrong with that. The offer might become good enough once the price of the car comes down.
2) If Bitcoin becomes the world's reserve currency daily volatility as well as yearly purchasing power increases would come way down. Purchasing power would only increase with World GDP growth and lost bitcoins. That's a few percent a year, not dozens like in your example. During global recessions purchasing power could even go down. Interest rates would also adjust to the new form of money and the state of the economy just like they do now. Money is used to organize the world's human capital/labor power. Think of money as human capital/labor power in symbol form.
3) Economic crises end when asset prices have fallen so much that it becomes too tempting for investors to buy goods/stocks/bonds/real estate/commodities and hire workers again. Which leads to rising prices and falling unemployment. The role of governments in that is mostly psychological. Whether a central bank changes interest rates, does QE, lets its currency go into hyperinflation or "intentionally" causes a recession does not change the amount of human capital in its economy. The human capital needs to reorganize on its own anyway.  
There was a lot more going in the 1970s than just the oil crisis. The Vietnam War, late stage hippies, implementation of the Civil Rights Act, Nixon shock, Watergate etc. On the macro level there was a rotation of capital from bonds and stocks into commodities especially crude oil and gold. While nominal prices for stocks and bonds increased, adjusted for inflation prices fell through the 1970s. Their purchasing power went down. Since stocks and bonds are major forms of collateral used for lending and investors cut down on investing as they were concerned about the future of the economy unemployment was high. What eventually changed? The same as always. Inflation adjusted prices fell so much that the risk for investors became acceptable again even with all the madness going on in the world. Stock and bond prices adjusted for inflation rose and unemployment fell in the 1980s economic cycle.
I recommend watching:  
How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio  
Note how he says government intervention helps with a "beautiful deleveraging". Cutting spending, defaulting on debt and investors taking risks again is also enough to deleverage and get out of a depression without government intervention.

Most of the biggest economies in the world used to have a gold standard yet the population was still able to take out loans in the form of banknotes issued by commercial banks. These notes were not as widely accepted as gold coins but they did put upward pressure on prices during economic expansions.
No matter if an economy used fiat money or a fixed money supply both have historically experienced business cycles. Bitcoiners are not Keynesians and generally follow different schools of economic thought. Not only was this issue discussed from the beginning, it's one of the main reasons Bitcoin exists.

Sergio's follow-up blog post has the ExtraNonce data which wasn't debunked. 
Bitmex repeated the analysis in 2018. 
They came to the conclusion that there was a dominant miner in 2009 who mined around 700,000 bitcoin. That dominant miner got the reward that Satoshi used in the first transaction to Hal. I have nothing but respect for Satoshi but he slipped up there.

Everything but solipsism exist on a spectrum of probability. Absolute certainty outside of solipsism is impossible. I find estimates in percentages more useful than words like "likely". There is no need for the "no", it seems to me we are in agreement.
