Governments consider it a property/commodity.
Now reading this language in the law it is a currency now?
What the fuck?
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:55:18
It doesn't. At all.
How is using my paycheck to contribute to retirement funds and my mortgage putting all my eggs into one basket? Seems like I am securing my future + building equity. That sounds like diversity to me.
Not to mention investing in crypto on the side as another vehicle for securing my financial standing in the future.
I'm really not understanding. But I would love to if you could elaborate. Perhaps we can learn from each other.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:32:27
Okay. Thanks for the clarification.
So while my BTC still appreciates in value, and well beyond what I lost, I can still write off a loss.

I had a different experience from you. 
My team mostly works from home. Myself included. Once in a while we all agree to meet/work out of the office for the day. 
Last time we met, they all came to me to talk about BTC. They had a feeling I would know about it. I had a much different interaction than you did. All of my coworkers were were curious and had a positive outlook on crypto. I told them how to get started and all that. They all went home that day and opened up Coinbase/Gemini accounts to check it out.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:00:48
Bitcoin is global. It will be much harder to shut down. But yah, US government (and other governments) can definitely try and do what they can, but ultimately crypto will live on regardless.
Hell, if they go after BTC, then we'll just welcome in Monero as our lord and savior (or some other super privacy coin).
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:34:23
What bothers me about all these banking people talking about crypto and how they say, "it's a good idea" or "we'll provide it if people want it.."
Why not just let those crypto currencies do what they're already doing? Why do they want us to use THEIR crypto?
Oh yah, because they want to control the public. Fuck that.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:54:27
I've also been calling for a dip, too. That's why I sold a nice portion ATH.
Still hasn't happened, but I'm not willing to back off from my prediction and rebuy. 
I was thinking it would go down to 6-8k range, but maybe that is too optimistic. Perhaps I should rebuy at 8k.
Great write-up.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:48:09
Yah, you lost some value.
But you still made out like a bandit.
Think about it: You bought in at $24. Even if you lost a bunch of BTC at current value, you still made so much money. Be proud.

I think so. I'm not putting in any more money until it dips. It might not happen today, or tomorrow, or even this week, but I suspect we'll see a correction soon.
With that said, I been calling for a correction for over a week now and it kind of happened and didn't happen. WE had some price spikes, but they weren't corrections, IMO. 
So I might be speaking out of my ass. Who knows, right? That's part of the fun.

Blocking access to bitcoin isn't going to do anything. People will still accumulate it.
The only thing governments can do is simply ban use of bitcoin. But even then, that isn't going to be effective as long as other governments/countries out there support it. 
The beauty of Bitcoin is the fact that it is global and decentralized. It's hard to control something that connects people beyond the limitations/borders of independent governments. 
Nevermind Bitcoin. Think on a larger scale: Adoption of cryptocurrency is more or less inevitable. It's becoming more and more mainstream by the day. If Bitcoin fails, something else will rise. I think people are getting really tired of their goverments fucking shit up. Crypto is a good hedge against the fuckery of inflation/fiat/etc.

I haven't had one issue with Coinbase. It is incredibly user friendly and was a great stepping-stone into the cryptoworld.
I still have a Coinbase account, but I've moved onto doing my trading on GDAX and other exchanges now.

2018 can either get really muddy, or can be a giant leap forward.
It really depends on what governments decide to do. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:38:30
Why would I put every last dollar I own into crypto?
That's just dumb. Regardless of how you feel about crypto, putting all your eggs in one basket is literally the dumbest thing you can do. 
I still have my 401k, I still have my IRA. I contributed to those prior to discovering crypto, and will continue to contribute to those as I continue to invest in crypto.

You need to be able to have cash available on GDAX to trade.
How you get that cash is up to you. You can wire money or link a bank-account. But the easiest is to transfer from coinbase -&gt; GDAX.

By buying directly from Coinbase, you WILL pay more money than on an exchange.
They make money by charging you more for the coin. That's how they stay afloat.
As far as the difference between buying from Coinbase versus an ATM, I wouldn't know. I never checked one out. But from what I understand, their fees are even higher. I saw a video last night that said some of them take 20% (!!!!!?) of the sale. That's insane! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:01:17
If BTC falls, something else will rise.
You can't shut down the crypto train. Crypto adoption is inevitable. I think that's the major take-away from all this.
You can ban one, but a replacement will immediately take it's place. This is a natural part of the evolution of the internet. We're a globalized community-- now we need a globalized, easy to use, secure and anonymous method of transaction in our virtual space.
If its not BTC, it is something else. I don't think governments have the power to stop "it."  Whatever that "it" might be.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:21:02
I watched this video: 
Full disclosure: At the end of it, the guy recommends B-cash. Which I don't necessarily agree with; but with that said, the entire video is a pretty good description of what the Lightning Network actually is. He may be biased, I dunno. But regardless, it is worth taking a look.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:54:14
Oh, I don't disagree with you at all.
I don't think BTC is the end-all-be-all of crypto. In fact, I think I think it's actually pretty shitty considering the huge amount of resources it takes to process transactions. It's not good for the environemnt.
But the general idea is that crypto is here to stay. It might not be BTC, but it will be something else. BTC might pop, but you, as a smart investor, should be aware of these risks. And if you do get in the game, be ready to leave the game appropriately.
At the end of the day, you're your own risk manager.

Industries slowly crumble.
Look at television/cable. That shit is dying to Netflix. QUICKLY, too. I remember watching Netflix commercials back in like... 1999 or something? Maybe very early 2000s. Look at it now. It's destroying the cable television industry.
Same thing can be done with banks and finance.

I don't know about Satoshi because there isn't much to know. Some people think it was one person. Others think it was a group. I dunno. I didn't study the history.
Either way, why does the fact that s/he/they in hiding matter? Can't it be because the possibly of them owning a metric fuckton of coin makes them very real and susceptible targets to theft or worse?
What do you think would happen if this mysterious Satoshi be found? How would they affect the government? In what way? The product is already out there. Nothing you can do to stop it.
And yes, you're absolutely right that a successful bitcoin has the power to disrupt government. And that's not a bad thing, either. Change isn't bad. Especially with how long the current fat cats have been running society. Time for some new blood, no?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:07:22
What if you lose money? For example, I tried to short BTC and actually ended up losing a very small portion. Can I use that as a deduction on my taxes, despite BTC still appreciating over the value that I initially sold/bought-back for?
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:00:04
I understand what you're saying.
I think you'd have to have a lot of governments hop on that train and ban crypto in order for that to be successful. Unless I'm misinterpreting things, countries in Asia such as Japan and Korea are really embracing the idea of crypto/bitcoin. Didn't Korea just announce their biggest mall is accepting bitcoin in all their stores?
I think that's huge.
Even if one (big) government makes things illegal, there are others that might not feel that way. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:46:29

Okay, I think I understand more now.
I think dumping all your money into something will always be an inherently stupid idea. Even if you wholeheartedly believe that Google will rule the world din 30 years, you probably shouldn't put your entire savings into Google stock. 
It all comes down to Risk Management. Even if you truly believe in something, you should always CYA (cover your ass) "just in case." You never know. For example with BTC/crypto, governments can still try and shut it down. While I don't think they will ultimately be successful if they do, but that's still a legitimate fear.
Why would I want to have all my money tied up into something that big daddy government might one day fuck in the ass? It's all about Risk Management. No matter how much I believe in it, I still need to be be safe. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:31:53
I think its better for bitcoin to be less and less associated with criminal activity.
That makes it (and crypto in general) easier for the public to actually adopt it as a currency. Old folk don't want to know that crypto is associated with "bad" stuff. Regardless of whether or not that's how BTC actually become a useful means of transaction in the silk road and all that fun stuff.

Jamie Dimon lost my respect when he insulted the crypto community. Something like, "they're stupid and dangerous," right?
Just because of that shit alone, I hope more and more people remove their money from banks and into crypto. 
It's one thing to have an opinion and fight for it (because let's be honest, he's only spreading FUD because less money in his bank = less profits), but it is another to insult people.
Unfortunately, I have been banking with CHASE all my life. I think I'm going to have to a different bank/credit union for my bank accounts. You don't just fucking insult a customer like that.

If I'm not mistaken, some exchanges are region-only. As in, you can't get an account unless you're ID-ed and accepted for that region.
FOr example, I wasn't able to get an account on one of the exchanges (already forgot the name, lol) because my state didn't allow it.

You only care because you're not prepared to lose. If you're investing with money you're not willing to part with, then you're doing it wrong. 
You invest in something and hold because you believe in it. You sell once you don't believe anymore, or once you earned enough or just want to cash some out.
That's the theory behind people's "HODL" mentality. We have the belief that the price will rebound and climb again. Which is also why people choose to buy during these dips. Because again, they belief this is an opportunity to profit.
You don't lose money when you've already mentality prepared yourself for that loss. Every cent I put into my diverse crypto portfolio is a cent I've already parted with. If I don't get it back-- that's OK.

It's possible, but the price differences might actually be pretty negligible when you consider transaction fees. You have to calculate how purchase price + possible purchase fees + transfer fees. It might just not be worth it after that.

I guess it's a wait-and-see game at this point, eh? I'm optimistic in crypto adoption as a whole. There are more "government" friendly cryptos out there like Ripple that might be more acceptable if Bitcoin isn't.  Or maybe cryptos that are hyper anonymous like Monero will have to be used to undermine governments.
Who knows? It's a very exciting time either way. Good or bad, I think we're seeing the evolution of the internet (and as a result, society on a global scale) right in front of our eyes.

Not everything is rainbows and sunshine with the Lightning Network. On the surface it looks like a pretty neat upgrade, but when you look into it, it seems like a semi-bitcoin bank. I dunno if I like that.

Your friend probably sells high and buys low. 
This works great if you're good at it. You can also fuck up and lose money on it. You have to be OK with losing if you do lose. Otherwise I wouldn't suggest it.
But yes, theoretically when done right, you can make "make more with less."

If you know something is about to occur ahead of the general public, you're able to take advantage/manipulate the situation/market.
For example, with BCH, did you notice how the price was rising quite quickly a week before it was on GDAX? That could have been a planned pump followed by the dump once it reached GDAX and inflated itself a bit more. And now its still correcting. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:49:22
That assumes that something will eventually take over Bitcion in superiority?
I don't disagree. Bitcoin is expensive and slow. Wouldn't be surprised if we end up using something else as the major cryptocurrency instead.

Inflation my dude. Their currency is depreciating in value. 
That's what happens when you keep printing money. 
That's what BTC so valuable. There are only so few coins available. This prevents inflation. 
This post has a lot to do with BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:48:41
I completely disagree.
Internet changed how we think about networking, commerce, and spread of information. It connected us and developed a global community.
What comes next is building transactions/trade between all these inter-connected communities.
Even if Bitcoin dies, crypto will live on. This is just further advancement of the digital age.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:54:15
If governments kill it, then yah. Or if some other crypto takes over.
I imagine the 2nd reason is more likely than the first. In fact, I think that will happen regardless.

I would wait for a possible correction.
I'm not buying anymore unless the price has a significant drop before Monday. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:11:21
I dunno if we're reaching that "tipping point" yet.
People definitely heard of crypto, but only a small fraction of those people are getting involved. Most people either A) think it's a bubble that will burst any moment, or B) don't think it will replace fiat, or C) just don't want to get involved at the moment and are waiting to see what will develop in the coming months/years.
As far as stupid money goes...  I dunno what to tell you. I HOPE people don't invest their money like idiots. I really, really hope they don't. You should only ever invest what you're willing to LOSE.
But then there are people on these subreddits that been posting they are taking out credit to buy crypto, or borrowing against their mortgage? Taking out loans? Uhh... yah, I think that's kind of... bad.

I think all this FUD from typical news/financial sources opens up a huge opportunity for alternative news sources to take advantage of this cryptomania.
VICE should start their own financial news sector where they can focus on the growth of crypto economy. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:47:53
If you're going to do it, I would really consider doing your research first on whether or not you think now, in particular, is the best to to invest that large stack of cash.
Only reason why I mention this is because some people think we're about to hit a major correction, others don't think so. You wouldn't want to put your money in now only to find out you could have bought a lot more with it had you waited a bit.
Just food for thought.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:58:33
Is there a reason why I keep seeing bitcoin addresses posted? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:03:41
This is exactly it.
This is just part of the "global evolution," so to speak. The internet connected us. Now we're putting in place methods of trade/transaction/etc. within this new inter-connected community.

It didn't have an affect, but that doesn't mean it won't have an affect later.
I wouldn't completely ignore this event. Let's see how this news affects Bitfinex moving forward-- which may ultimately affect Bitcoin.

Right there with you, bud.
Expecting a correction. I got my buy orders in layers between 8.5 -&gt; 6k. I might not even keep the 8.5k up. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:54:35
I think you're being unfair by saying trading has nothing to do with predictions.
There's a reason some people are better at it than others. There's also a reason why it is a huge industry where people pay others do that for them.
Good investing is informed decision making with risk management. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:31:59
I think this is a great idea. I hope it works. 
Good on you for trying to invest, . I wish I did that when I was younger!

I was discussing this with a buddy of mine a while ago.
There is/are definitely some crypto-Rockefeller(s?) out there. Give him or her a few more years and they'll come out of the woodwork once Bitcoin hits mainstream.
We're going to see new-"old money" soon. If that makes any sense.

Going to third this.
I have absolutely 0 issues using my CHASE bank account to buy crypto off Coinbase.
I also wanted to through out there that in addition to my bank, I also buy with my BoA credit card and never had an issue, either. Not sure if BoA treats their CCs differently than their banking when it comes to crypto.

I haven't sold my crypto to USD yet, but I have made crypto to crypto transactions.

Don't we all though? That's why I want it to dip.
I just want more!!! I'm a glutton.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:52:31
Look at GDAX right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:26:10
That's the thing. When trying to diversify your crypto portfolio with multiple cryptos, you have to trade in BTC on the exchanges. So now I have to convert the crypto values at to USD at that given day vs how it is valued another day? It's really confusing.
For example, I saw bitcoinGold was ridiculously low sometime ago (at around 180), so I traded some BTC for bitcoinGold knowing bitcoinGold is going to climb in a few days.
So then I sold that bitcoinGold for nearly double what I bought it for back to BTC... And instead of transferring that back to my wallet, I bought Ripple when it took a dip.
So now I sold btc -&gt; bitcoingold -&gt; btc -&gt; Ripple. But how do I gauge how much tax I'm paying.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:19:32
Called it yesterday. I said it will fall to somewhere 6-8k. I just sold a nice chunk when it was flying in the 10+, going to rebuy at the dip =D. 
That's the fun, boiz!!!
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:17:36
Naw, dude. I'm still learning the game, too. I only really do this because I have the time. I work from home for my job, so tracking the markets and trading on the fly is accessible for me.
But by no means am I really, really great at it. It is easy to make trades when you're trading "low" (which is different for everyone) amounts of money. You're not as attached to it.  It's a whole other animal when you're moving large amounts.
I'm sweating bullets right now because in my loins I feel that we're going to hit a correction, so I should theoretically sell my stuff. But man, what if it doesn't!? Then I really fucked up.  So I'm like going back and forth on this. My rules say I should sell, so I think I probably will.
But it won't be easy... 
EDIT. I found this video a few weeks ago and it helped me understand day trading in crypto much better. Check it out: 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:06:56
I think we're both saying the same thing but we just choosing to get stuck on a particular word.
Either way, you're absolutely right. Each trader needs to have a set of rules and follow them. Which is really, really hard because removing emotion out of the equation isn't so simple when you're dealing with money. 
Personally, I have my "rules" written out in neatly on a piece of paper that sits right in front of my keyboard. Try to limit that emotion to capitalize on gains. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:47:47
I got my buy orders in already. I'm expecting this as well.
Might not be tonight or tomorrow, but I think it will happen. And that's fine. We'll just buy a lot more :).
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:36:48
I think Bitcoin is due for a correction very, very soon.
I'm about to pull the trigger and sell some. I don't think this is a good time to buy. I believe a dip is going to occur sooner than later.
...Or maybe I just really wanna buy at a dip and deluding myself into believing it will happen.
EDIT: What I'm saying is, if I was in your shoes, I would wait. Your money has a good chance of going farther if you're patient. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:35:41

@_date: 2017-11-19 15:17:51
Well it would just mean your bitcoin is valued higher.
But then you have to make a decision, do you then hold it and let it climb in value? Sell some when it is high value, and buy more when it is low value? Do you maybe buy alt-coins with it? Or sell some and take home some money? 
Do you need money? What if Bitcoin completely crashes and you lose everything? Are you prepared?
So many questions!
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:38:36

He's not living under a rock. He's not ignorant, either.
He's just using the following *bold* strategy: "If I deny hard enough and close my ears/eyes to it, maybe it'll go away. He's hoping he has that affect on the public as well."
Too bad that's not the case. Hehehhee. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:00:56
Yah, but someone could easily "predict" it goes down and it does go down. Now their "prediction" is correct.
I'm not sure why that word stands out to you so much. Predictions always come with a degree of assumed failure. The weatherman isn't often right, but s/he makes "predictions" every day and gets paid pretty well to do it, too.

Giving you an upvote, OP.
We're due for a dip. I keep thinking it will be between 6-8k. Still not ready to move away from that notion despite prices hanging out above 10k.

Have you ever been to Vegas (or any other casino city) and done same gambling?
What kind of attitude do you bring? Or "would" you bring?
You have to come into the game prepared to lose. Same with crypto/investing. If you put in only what you're willing to lose, then you should never have emotional swings-- that includes on being pissed about"potential" profit losses.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:10:41

If it was an inside job, don't understand why they would scare people into thinking identities were compromised. Unless the idea is to really induce panic-- but I dunno.
When you say, "If they cracked 2FA then all of us would have much bigger problems that extend to any account where we use it," are you suggesting that cracking 2FA means cracking all 2FA associated to the device? JUst making sure. This would be super scary shit.
@_date: 2019-05-08 00:57:31
Let's not forget the fact that they mentioned user identities were compromised? That shit isn't kosher. And the fact that 2FA keys were affected, too? DOes that have any impact on the rest of your 2FA keys if you use one device for all your keys?
