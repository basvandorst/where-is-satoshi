Circle did the same to me a while back. Just today Coinbase closed my account (did it once before, but reopened it after giving them more identity docs). Circle just told me to look at their User Agreement and I couldn't find anything I did wrong. I don't know what I did wrong with Coinbase either.

I guess I learn something new everyday. Didn't know the stocks through my stock broker is held by a 3rd party. My physical stock certificates that I have in my safe at home are for public companies. I'll probably request more physical stock certificates for the companies I have shares in that I don't plan to sell anytime soon. Don't know what jurisdiction or what that means.

My stock broker could if they wanted to break the law and take them. My stock broker holds the stock certificates for me. I do have some physical stock certificates in my safe that I had requested by my stock broker, but the rest they hold.

You didn't try buying a car with fiat, you tried it with debit card. You could of just taken the cash he gave you and went and paid with that cash. Seems simple to me, even more simple then bitCoin. Instead you tried to do it with the banks, which of course is going to cause problems.
