PayPal does not let me use them in my little ma and pa vape shop.  I inquired why and they said because it's a shop that sells nicotine. They control who can use their platform.

It feels like all these big companies are jockeying around to position themselves for mass adoption. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 22:10:07
Both.  Ask EVERY place you purchase something if they accept cryptocurrencies.   Frequent places that accept them.  Replenish what you spend by buying more cryptocurrencies with the cash you would have spent.  Help Ma and Pa shops to accept them.  The whales are not running the show here...   WE are in control of mainstream adoption.

I just got my bitpay commercial account up and I will need btc and bch stickers.

Ok, it could go that way... or decentralized exchanges become mainstream and million of javascript programmers using Lisk (shameless plug) start building dapps at a pace that puts Facebook and all their talented programmer to shame rendering coinbase another Netscape, Myspace, or Instagram.

People who find a programmatic way of doing this will stabilize bitcoin even more.

Well, I do own a small "Ma-Pa" shop (not a grocery shop).  So let me change the scenario...  Your brother needs money to open a  grocery shop in a  neighborhood needs/wants fresh food (fruits, vegetables, meats).  You loan him some money because he is going to give you 10% of the profits.  You speculate that the business is going to be profitable and you will get your ROI soon.  
If the price isn't fair, people will not buy it.  I believe in capitalism.  
I get what you are saying, however, making money through speculation on a product/service that helps humanity is AWESOME!  Making money through speculation on a product/service that takes advantage of people are people that are parasites on society.  But it's not bad to make money on purely "speculation".
I hope to make some "speculative" money on cryptocurrency because it solves (or at least is claiming to) some serious world problems.  I am a HODLer...

Can you put this in a chart so I can believe it?
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:18:09
Sorry, my bad.  I just bought more yesterday. Happens everytime. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:44:34
You speculate that your neighborhood needs/wants fresh food (fruits, vegetables, meats), therefore you open a small grocery shop.

It is a great technology.  I am a technologist of 20 years and have been through a lot in those 20 years.  Let's not get ahead of ourselves with how great IT CAN BE.  There is a lot of work to go through to realize what this can do.  We need consensus.  I think the people have an opportunity to be a part of that consensus in a way we haven't had in a while and that is exciting.  People in the United States see this as an investment.   This is just a byproduct of what it can become.

I dont know if I fully agree with your opinion.  Assuming this is true, you need to understand that as you get older, your investments should get less risky and this is all still very speculative. The industry has people like Craig Wright saying things like there is a flaw in Segwit and it will be exposed soon. Whether you believe him or not, he has been there from the beginning and knows a lot more then you or I.  What does peek the interest of old people (like myself) is adoption and regulation. This you cannot argue.  We are still in the infancy stage of "The promise of Bitcoin".  As adoption happens, you will pull in those older generations and their money.  I encourage all the sideline investors and young people to get involved.  Go onto github and see how you can help test.  Find stories of countries where they have been economically pillaged and show how bitcoin has helped.  Talk to your representative. And continue to HODL...

1. Incorrect, they did a test of transferring bitcoin over a hamm radio. This is very insecure, but the point being it the internet is not required. 
2. Electricity can be free (solar, wind, etc).
3. We are working on this.  It took FOREVER to download songs via my dial up network in the 90s.
4. You pay what the market sets, not what Visa sets. 
The issue of the internet going down or electricity being turned off is a non issue. For those fortunate enough to take this for granted, if this was to happen, we would have bigger issues to deal with other then the inconvenience of transferring bitcoin.
Also, many say they dont pay to use their Visa.  This is incorrect. The merchants pay and transfer the fees to customers. 
I think a big mind shift of the way we do business is going to be that the sender pays the transfer fees, not the receiver. This will make the actual value of the procurement more transparent.

They are starting to understand

I hope the hype is over!  Maybe discussions about adoption will start to rule these boards.

LL Cool J already addressed this...  Don't call it a comeback!

It costs more to use bitcoin then it does to use Visa?
