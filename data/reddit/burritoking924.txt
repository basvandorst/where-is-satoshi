It was about $550. It seemed like someone wanted to pay $950 for it legitimately, so I delivered bitcoins to the persons wallet after they paid.

I will try to remember. I definitely remember the money I am out, this thread should be mentally attached to the money.
This PayPal scam happend after I got hit on Venmo for 3 bitcoins, 900 each. Scammer sent $2700 to my new Venmo account. I thought the balance in my Venmo account was finalized. I found someone on Local bitcoins and bought 3 bitcoins for about $1700 total. I sent the bitcoins. The next day Venmo said that the charges are reversed and the the money was taken from my Venmo. The Venmo scammer, tells someone that I am available for scamming. So this second scammer contacts me and wants to do business with PayPal. I say yes, get the $950 payment to cover my loss, and block the Venmo and PayPal scammer from my phone. I was texting both of these people.

I sent over a bitcoin, and got a $950 chargeback. Scammer wanted to pay me 900 for a btc. I said $1,000. We agreed on $950. I hope this can help me and others who have been scammed get the chargeback reversed. The scammer did a chargeback through PayPal, which decided in my favor and gave the $950 to me. Then they did a chargeback through the credit card company.

The CC company contacted PayPal. PayPal gave my account a negative balance, and PayPal paid the company out of their own bank. I was in debt to PayPal the $950 balance. Of course I paid it off to PayPal, I don't want interest to build or legal action to be taken. 
Now PayPal is supposed to be fighting for my case to get the money back with the CC company. This could take a couple more months to be resolved.

I have written two books; one is 77,000 words and the other is ~34,000. This interests me. I do not know all of the logistics of bitcoin. I do not understand the technology as well as others. I would like to have someone (you!?!?!?) help me with the technical parts. Like the security of a paper wallet - I don't know if a public and private key are hosted on the wallet. I will also want to recieve guidance on the lessons to teach. I will do the creative part and the writing. I love writing. I would post a link to my two books, but I do not want to plug. Please message me if you want to help with the technical parts, give me ideas. I am ready.

The scammer sent the money as a gift. When you send money to another person via PayPal, you can send it as a gift where no fees are taken. Or it can be sent to pay for services, which PayPal takes a small fee from.
