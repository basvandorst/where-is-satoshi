As a person who was helped immensely by LSD and shrooms for my depression, dependency, anxiety, and almost my past, I fully support MAPS.
@_date: 2014-01-22 07:56:46
lol that's insane.
@_date: 2014-08-16 22:04:40
LSD worked for my dependency on weed and adderall, so that's one anecdotal evidence :p

tl;dr We don't really care about the bitcoin community as a whole (fuck self-regulation!!), if you're complaining, come up with better services than ours (bro, if it's even possible), we'll be talking to Bitcoin foundation and other members to make sure that we stay powerful and gradually, they'll say that it's okay for a pool to be above 51%. (by then, majority of the users wouldn't care whether something is decentralized or not, so we're good!)
Fuck you Ghash.

You are doing good service for the community, good sir! Let's take Ghash down!!
@_date: 2014-06-16 18:56:39
They don't have to apologize for being popular. They have to apologize for threatening the Bitcoin network, especially with the history that they have of doing double spending.
@_date: 2014-06-15 21:56:57
dat $15 deal.
@_date: 2014-06-15 21:25:01
Thanks Ghash. Thanks.

I'm pretty sure that when drones are improved and mainstream, each household could have their own drones, that could voluntarily be used to hop others' packages. Maybe an open source drone connected to the bitcoin blockchain, or have its own coin.. "proof of delivery" so that drone operators can get income. I just think that decentralization is inevitable.
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:05:00
Where can I see this? Thanks
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:28:43
hmmmmmmmm... *grin*

Because I'm not talking about scammers.
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:15:43
...holy shit. Bravo guys, bravo.
@_date: 2014-06-16 18:41:30


This gradual, "oh centralization is a-okay!" mantra will become repeated over and over the next few months across all Bitcoin forums until the majority thinks that it's fine, and then Bitcoin Foundation itself may even say it because we've seen just how useless they are. Fuck that. Something needs to be done on a protocol level, or the community as a whole needs to keep resisting this.
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:31:30
Honestly, looking at some of the bitcoiners on here as of late, I'd rather have the happy go lucky people.
This community has turned into shit compared to months ago.
@_date: 2014-06-12 01:47:02
have fun; it was TOTALLY worth the BTC with the girls and their high-res photoshoots. no joke.

Why is there a z-index of 3 on .globe? Can't even click the link.

sexart.com on that list has videos.. i don't think the selection is as great as regular metart though.

@_date: 2013-04-27 01:59:04
Ahhh thank you for the informative reply. Very interesting..!
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:23:35
Same here. I withdrew 50 minutes ago and it's still not showing up in my blockchain. I'm not at home so I can't see whether the transaction went through with my wallet.
Edit: it went through!
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:44:44
Congrats is all I can say.
Encrypt and lock away,
to keep the hackers at bay.
@_date: 2013-11-11 08:30:49
You should probably lay off on the drugs yo.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:26:52
Delicious irony.
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:56:30
Same here. Not showing up on blockchain.
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:15:53
Same here.. Would like info on these exchanges as well as any other alternatives!
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:16:32
They can't delete your tweets...that's not how Twitter works. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:03:43
What's interesting about that? I never thought that being right or left would make a difference when it's mostly about top vs bottom
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:28:05
Ah I do check my credit regularly.
Awesome, thanks for the help! I feel a lot more confident going into this! :)
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:24:18
Just did last night on some Metart goodness ;D I want to sell off the coins I was "forced" to buy with Bitfloor closing though.
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:15:01
Does bitfloor use Google Apps for Business?
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:08:30
I just bought some bitcoins at market price as well, and sent it over to my wallet (still pending).
I hope it all works out for you! &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:51:47
This, OP. Use bitfloor.. it works fine.
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:03:25
Actually, I just saw that they took off the Cash deposit option using LocalTill. Could something really be up?
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:20:48
I think sendgrid is only used to automate the emails which include the transaction details. Somebody needs to get the headers of a support email or something.
I'm not sure why bitfloor would send this email to select groups/people.
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:07:43
Right, but what does being left/right have to do with Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-06-05 23:32:54
people like this taint the image of libertarians.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:47:12
Sorry but you can only blame yourself.
We all know that Bitcoin is still in its infancy. You took the risk and now you're going to have to deal with it (whether you hold or sell, that's your choice)
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:46:27
Bitcoin isn't supposed to be exciting. You're missing the entire idea behind this.
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:11:30
Can't wait till the weak hands drop their coins so we can pick em up.
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:46:11
Maybe it's temporary as the other 2 methods take 2-4 days to complete.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:04:09
Oh definitely. I was just worried about them disappearing and doing something with my Driver's License information (it's probably nothing compared to SSN though)
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:29:55
Is it showing up on blockchain? I'm not in front of my personal laptop to look at my wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:54:35
I can second the blockchain problem.
edit: my coins have arrived after an hour and a half!
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:17:36
Why? There's no question as to what Bitcoin is doing and is possible of doing; it all falls under the umbrella of libertarianism if you're familiar with the concept. It is what it is.
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:42:38
I don't have ACH withdrawal set up with Bitfloor yet.. and it says to cancel open orders.. I'm wondering if my funds are going to be stuck in it.
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:49:34
Well, more like 2ch lol.
@_date: 2013-04-15 20:59:22
oh, okay.
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:26:32
Yay, DRM coins.
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:47:12
Same here :/
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:10:10
Do what you want to do, nobody knows what's going to happen exactly. Just remember that you're responsible for your own outcome and not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:58:13
Mine went out too, but it's not showing up on blockchain. I can't check my wallet right now.
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:16:40
I've originally been using it since the ING Orange days as a savings account and it's been quite useful. Why not just keep it?
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:44:43
Do you see anything on your wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:51:48
Starting to sound like market manipulation. OP should edit and erase this.
Edit: LocalTill is now disabled on bitfloor.com.. weird.
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:05:47
Yeap, it went through. Took about an hour and half.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:44:15
Same here. I'm not at home to see the transaction (people have been talking about seeing it on their wallets)
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:39:16
I'm not that knowledgeable when it comes to email, but OP's email looks legit. Can anybody chime in?
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:00:14
I withdrew 40 minutes ago and still nothing on blockchain.
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:12:03
Christ.. there's absolutely no decent exchange to sell my coins either. GAH.
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:41:59


Who said this?
Also, if a person is threatening to DDoS and his/her identity is identified through the recorded IP address or email headers, that person deserves to be identified.

Nobody knows. Make the decision for yourself.
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:22:26
I think you fail to realize that this is a libertarian dream coming to fruition. I mean, look at the political links to the right of the subreddit.
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:27:32
Whaaaa? o_o
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:17:15
How about now?
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:55:54
why are you here? sounds like you've got some irrational hatred towards aspies and libertarians lawl.
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:20:39
Yeah that might've been it. My coins arrived after an hour and a half so I'm certain that you'll get yours too!
