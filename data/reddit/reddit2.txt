What would the price be if 1% all of world's transactions were now BTC?
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:36:51
Sorry, as of May 6th, there is no way this is the best investment opportunity in the history of mankind. It may have been 2 years ago. However, my Mom and the general public now knows about it. Sorry.
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:56:32
Don't see how you can predict the future like this.
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:43:09
Welcome to @_date: 2014-07-02 02:48:06
What about these coins? 
@_date: 2014-06-18 22:49:23
Yup. Did you give me it?!
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:06:34
I don't have a wallet yet. Should I create one?
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:04:45
But, she even called someone else!
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:04:56
Let us know what happens please.
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:00:03
Did you give a presentation or just talk openly? Please provide more information. You haven't said too much.
@_date: 2014-04-29 12:27:13
You are pretty dang naive to think that every $1 invested in Bitcoin will yield $2200 in future dollars.
Crazy. This place sounds more and more like a MLM scheme.
@_date: 2014-06-12 16:40:55
Yup, if hotels didn't take a credit card on file then the price of a hotel would be much much higher to cover the chance of vandalism, theft, etc.
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:14:01
Nailed it. Thanks for providing another perspective. This community doesn't like these usually so we never get to see them.
@_date: 2014-05-04 14:37:45
Wow thanks for sharing. That's the biggest bunch of garbage ever. His feeds on Twitter and Facebook are fricken horrible! I went back to 6 months ago and the difference is night and day.
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:23:38
Cool thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:01:17
Don't these companies make other risky investments? Don't see why this is so risky they can't even talk about it.
@_date: 2014-06-16 14:00:29
Lol there are plenty of women here who aren't like that
@_date: 2014-04-29 12:11:48
Reviews are likely hidden because the person who wrote the review has a small number of total reviews, or a small number of friends.
@_date: 2014-04-29 12:23:46
A dev can alter Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-24 01:21:13
lol, made up? right....
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:36:05
Who buys 2k BTC? Why?
@_date: 2014-05-07 16:28:23
This is absolute bull shit people.
@_date: 2014-05-01 13:51:51
so many paranoid people here
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:11:30
Yes, but someone who accepts your BTC must sooner or later convert to fiat; thus, incurring the fee. Gotta pay taxes, rent, utilities somehow. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:02:56
Don't forget, you are in @_date: 2014-06-04 13:03:20
Lol what the heck is this comment being upvoted for?
@_date: 2014-06-18 22:23:52
Hahaha, someone gilded me for this comment
@_date: 2014-06-02 20:09:53
Why did you reply and say does it really matter?
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:22:22
I thought Bitcoin's purpose was to prevent exactly stuff like this from happening? I am very confused.
@_date: 2014-04-29 12:08:13
Lol. Wow. You are clueless
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:12:45
Even if 100% of landlords accepted it as payment, they sooner or later must convert to fiat to pay their bank notes and taxes.
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:38:48
It's basic economics. Why would they want to stop earning a profit now?
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:34:18
Who buys 2k BTC at once? They must be thinking BTC price is going much higher than 600.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:17:11
lol your parents must have been pissed!
edit: why the downvotes? This kid spelled hypocrites as follows: Hippocrates. LMAO
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:27:18
Do you have difficulty capitalizing the first word of your sentences?
@_date: 2014-04-29 13:57:47
All of the people or half?
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:59:11
I can send $1000 to my friend through Google Wallet. No fees on either end. No conversion on either end. Nothing.
@_date: 2014-06-19 12:36:24
Can't tell if sarcasm or for real. Lol
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:38:10
Please explain
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:58:38
This makes absolutely zero sense man. You missed the boat.
@_date: 2014-06-12 16:51:17
They will still require a credit card, lol.
@_date: 2014-04-29 12:25:48
Can't we lobby for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-07-02 02:48:41
What about these coins? 
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:24:29
What does that mean?
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:36:34
Yeah oops
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:13:58
I agree. Could you please explain your basic premise for why you think this will happen?
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:51:45
Bank fees for someone transferring nearly a million dollars are pretty immaterial. Also, the bank fee includes many protections that Bitcoin isn't able to afford us.
I like this forum, but please stop acting like Bitcoin is the end all and be all.
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:48:30
Thanks. Very interesting stuff.
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:47:03
For the post, why the heck would someone in the right mind put 401k funds into Bitcoin? 401k funds usually put in stable, long term investments.
For the subreddit, well good luck getting a post to the top of this subreddit complaining about this community.
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:38:05
Why do you call it 3.2511569? Just say 3.25 geez. The difference is immaterial.
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:37:38
Why did someone get rid of these?
@_date: 2014-05-19 18:10:34
Very surprised you have made this comment without it being hidden by down votes. Thanks for sharing. Very interesting.
@_date: 2014-10-09 14:29:13
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:27:42
Dumb spammer.
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:32:21
You are dense aren't you? He is acting rationally. Read an economics book.
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:37:15
Why yours?
@_date: 2014-04-29 12:12:21
This is all wrong. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:15:36
Why do you need to do this?
@_date: 2014-06-04 14:06:44


The heck?
@_date: 2014-06-24 01:08:26
It actually costs $35?
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:34:57
This kid spelled hypocrites as follows: Hippocrates. LMAO
@_date: 2014-05-04 22:49:37
What does that mean the known crypto girl?
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:34:46
How do you know this?
@_date: 2014-04-29 13:57:08
Haha ohh
@_date: 2014-05-04 22:58:37
Why didn't Bitcoin do it? Because their community sucks.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:33:48
Wow lol. BTC community is absolutely clueless
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:24:10
Could you please ELI5?
@_date: 2014-06-18 14:08:28
Lol, well you are posting on so you weren't the brightest bulb when I asked you. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:08:14
Pay your taxes. It isn't that difficult.
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:36:45
Sorry, as of May 6th, there is no way this is the best investment opportunity in the history of mankind. It may have been 2 years ago. However, my Mom and the general public now knows about it. Sorry.
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:04:24
And this is why I will continue to use my bank. No need to wonder if someone like you is scanning my accounts to "steal" and possibly return later.
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:11:58
5 to 30? So, that's like .001% accepting it in your area all the way up to .006%? Amazing.
@_date: 2014-06-01 15:50:25
To the moon w/ beers!
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:49:22
You sound like a douche bag.
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:17:09
I thought Bitcoin's purpose was to prevent exactly stuff like this from happening? I am very confused.
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:24:53
Automated response lol
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:15:53
How many BTC do you own and at what price?
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:23:02
lmao, some yes. not all.
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:18:57
What does this mean?
@_date: 2014-06-27 03:08:54
Why the hell would you have to pay 20%!?
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:15:48
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:17:51
I think NSA will backdoor the GHash. Game over! 
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:21:14
Small? Amazon?
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:56:08
How will it win every time? Won't foreign exchanges fees decrease to compete?
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:13:18
Finally someone who has a brain in this subreddit. Surprised you aren't downvoted lol
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:26:43
How does it do this?
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:15:34
Dude no one cares lol
@_date: 2014-06-11 19:46:01
Don't you think the NSA has already done this?
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:07:48
This forum used to not be full of morons.
@_date: 2014-06-04 14:05:29
Yes, grand idea. Let's create a list someone can exploit by hacking these companies employees' computers and stealing their BTC. Genius guys!
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:37:27
Basis for this?
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:39:08
So, why isn't the price plummeting lol
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:36:22
Neat, thank you.
@_date: 2014-06-04 15:08:25
I didn't say that. Actually, no proof online usually leads people to believe it is bull shit. This is online and anonymous after all.
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:38:22
What does this mean
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:28:00
is full of idiots. Did you expect anything less of a response from this group?
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:36:08
That's awesome. When did you originally buy into BTC?
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:15:49
This subreddit is such crap now.
@_date: 2014-04-16 14:18:46
Look at all of your comments in this thread. Everything has been downvoted. Good luck being an idiot everywhere you go.
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:57:43
@_date: 2014-04-08 16:42:23
Haha, so terrible that your community downvoted you, and upvoted me
@_date: 2014-07-02 02:49:13
What about these coins? 
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:02:31
Agreed. BTC is a rather bizarre phenomenon. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:39:12
I'm confused. Why are they doing this? Burn 1.2m BTC for what?
@_date: 2014-06-04 12:59:11
That makes zero sense.
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:36:52
Thanks, that is very interesting stuff.
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:40:04
? 
Are you saying of course they want to make money? 
@_date: 2014-07-02 02:48:22
What about these coins? 
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:37:34
Good luck it won't hit 9k
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:47:39
That was horrible. Fuck that lol.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:06:40
But can you explain what's going on in layman's terms?
@_date: 2014-05-19 14:05:30
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:09:05
This is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. All of these coins sound like pyramid/mlm schemes. Even Amazon won't touch.
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:34:17
The hell? You think Kane could affect the market like that?
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:25:12
Could you ELI5?
@_date: 2014-06-24 01:08:52
Well, then who is "actually" paying the $35 per transaction fee??
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:00:36
Why would they be interested on a personal level, when this was a presentation given at work? Don't understand.
@_date: 2014-06-24 02:10:49
Wow, so what exactly does this do to the overall economy? What does it mean for the long run?
@_date: 2014-07-02 02:49:24
What about these coins? 
@_date: 2014-06-07 13:52:57
You are a complete moron
@_date: 2014-06-25 14:16:32
Why do they do this? Sales focused?
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:12:51
Oh yes, B&amp;H can hardly survive without all of the "potential BTC customers"! Geez, you guys are clueless
@_date: 2014-04-08 13:46:47
Read the rest of the comments in this thread. You have no idea what you are talking about.
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:25:12
Wow, and your point?
@_date: 2014-04-29 12:23:02
Developers can just alter Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:51:32
Is collecting this even worth it? I don't get it.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:18:02
Finally a rational person in this damn subreddit.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:10:09
Why not just answer us here?
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:36:26
Lol what happened?
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:45:14
why is that? same here
@_date: 2015-01-19 12:50:09
Well that's the craziest thing I have ever read on the internet.
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:49:14
@_date: 2015-01-19 12:51:06
These folks don't seem to understand that. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 13:15:43
How do you know this?
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:46:27
There's still a risk there
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:23:51
You still do this? 
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:18:26
And if he didn't go to trial what would he be looking at?
@_date: 2015-02-17 13:07:08
Lol I'm pretty sure 80% of this forum is either uneducated or under 18. Good luck getting through to this bunch!
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:44:28
So main stream adoption is out
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:40:32
Am I actually in the right subreddit? Never seen someone actually talk about the negatives. Thank you for this.
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:25:03
Yup 100% correct
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:30:09
Bitcoin will achieve mainstream status... HOW?
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:17:22
What is the point of this
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:26:37
Tell that to a judge. Lmao
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:05:59
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:41:20
Google wallet, square, snap chat even offers free cash transfers...
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:27:59
Wow. These users have no clue
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:16:49
Free human? What the hell do you need to do w/ this crap that you can't do with what we have now? So confused.
@_date: 2015-02-11 21:06:44
Can you guys imagine if the USD had it's own subreddit and this bologna was posted daily regarding phishing emails? This is getting ridiculous. How can Bitcoin survive mainstream status without a third party holding our funds and providing insurance in case of a loss from something like this. It just makes no sense to me.
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:19:50
Doesn't this assume he bought in at $10 or less per BTC? 
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:19:34
This is why it will never be mainstream lmao
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:00:55
Lol this sound so much like Zeek Rewards/Pyramid scheme of the month etc
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:43:17
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:16:36
So you didn't file taxes lmao
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:43:47
@_date: 2015-02-06 00:21:30
I'm a normal regular guy. I'm a business manager for an engineering company. I don't really have any laws I need to break. I pay my taxes. Please enlighten me. I seriously have no clue what I'd need any of this for.
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:30:30
how will this ever become mainstream again?
@_date: 2015-02-04 03:53:44
You paid this guy back. Who's footing this bill?
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:05:08
You are quite naive if you think they care enough to complain to their superiors about a small account like yours. Lol
@_date: 2015-02-04 02:09:41
If it was marked as private then why did changetip show up?
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:17:56
BTC prices to decrease then
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:04:43
A planned "bank run" on an exchange? Genius
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:21:14
Girls will flock to me now! 
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:59:36
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:22:48
What was this?
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:35:34
Who foots the bill? 
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:40:23
Are you trolling us?
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:18:41
That sounds horrible. I can't imagine dragging my spouse through this ordeal. Get a real w2 income and get her that house she deserves!
@_date: 2015-02-17 13:07:50
Yes, yes they are.
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:45:24
Well it doesn't come from thin air. Customers clearly pay for this. Welcome to bitcoin exchanges acting like banks. Why do we use bitcoin again?
@_date: 2015-02-11 21:06:40
Can you guys imagine if the USD had it's own subreddit and this bologna was posted daily regarding phishing emails? This is getting ridiculous. How can Bitcoin survive mainstream status without a third party holding our funds and providing insurance in case of a loss from something like this. It just makes no sense to me.
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:27:58
Why bother? 
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:59:59
No because banks can handle being silent on this issue. Bitcoin needs to tell us how fucked we all are from a hack
@_date: 2015-02-26 03:30:43
Shhh... To the MOON!!
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:42:10
Why did you just tip nine cents
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:15:58
How is this any different that someone who doesn't use BTC...
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:37:51
This is completely overstated. It simply isn't that difficult to travel to different countries with funds...
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:24:25
Was his lawyer known for handling high profile cases like this? Seems like an idiot to me.
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:17:20
1BTC = $1k hasn't been true in over a year. What do you mean by this?
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:35:37
Well, that's fine and all but don't put all your eggs in one basket man. You just never know.
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:44:26
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:26:17
Are all exchanges like this now?
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:15:29
That sounds horrible. I would never do this to my spouse.
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:37:04
Factor of 2.5, or now close to 5...
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:16:19
Kind of strange..
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:47:28
We should all use one of the few larger exchanges.  Let them monopolize the market
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:03:06
Wtf lol
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:31:34
The point is if this is how they run the business they are just a bank with bitcoin lol
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:19:13
This has to be a troll.
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:02:27
Yes $300m loss spread over all banks is nothing at all. Barely even dents them
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:17:36
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:22:53
Why would they do this?
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:07:42
FBI agents saw his computer screen? Lol wtf?
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:00:56
You don't understand macroeconomics.  The $300m loss spread over all banks is a drop in a stadium sized bucket.
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:15:02
So you didn't file I'm assuming. Kind of odd to avoid one of the most important questions in an AMA...
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:01:49
She's right
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:22:07
Great explanation. Too bad his Mom doesn't have a clue and will likely bankrupt themselves defending this moron.
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:12:36
Most of these people have no access to internet...
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:33:06
