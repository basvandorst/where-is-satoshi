I installed the wallet on my OS ssd, i had no idea i had to download all that data. I have a larger harddrive on this same laptop though. But how do i tranfer the blockchain data to this disk?
Edit: Also, what do you mean i can still access my bitcoin? It doesnt show up in my wallet even after 2 hours now. I assumed it was because i had not downloaded the blockchain history.

So i downloaded Electrum on the other drive. Where do i drop the wallet.dat file to get my money on the new wallet?

Say i download a new wallet on the other harddrive, and completely download the bloackchain. All i need to do then is transfer the text.dat file to the new wallet from the old one, even though the old wallet doesnt seem to recognize that there are any bitcoins within it?

Interesting. Just what i needed. Ill let you know if it works. And again, thanks a lot for the help. I know its not easy dealing with all of these people like me trying to get into bitcoin but are somewhat clueless to bitcoin.

You tell me man... cause im stupid i guess?

I dont have a USB drive large enough. The blockinfo is easly over 10gb. Good to know my coins are safe though. Cant i just copy the files from C:/Programfiles/Bitcoin and Roaming/Appdata/Bitcoin over to my bigger harddrive? Or would that be unwise?

Im new to bitcoin. Just transfered some to the wallet on my compute. Currently 6 blocks deep. How long until it shows up in my desktop wallet?
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:26:34
OK man. Gonna try that then. Thank you!

Is it safe to backup wallet.dat, reinstall the same wallet program on the new drive then? Or maybe use that shortcut you mentioned. I am using bitcore. How do i get the blockchain data to my large harddrive?
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:24:29
Thanks for the tip. I will probably end up doing the same thing once i have bitcore up and running. I am currently downloading the entire blockchain history so my wallet will see the money i sent to it. was nice enough to help me change the blockchain directory since i installed the wallet on my OS designated SSD instead of my larger harddrive. 
Yesterday when i started i was hooked up to my phone with mobile data teethering, so it didnt take long for me to have depeleted my entire months worth of mobile data. So yeah, live and learn i guess.

But how do i get the wallet to recognize that the files are over on another harddrive. there is no option to set datalocations for blockchain data within the client.

But my wallet is empty, i still havent gotten the money i tranfered to it. See my edit. Thanks a lot for answering me btw. I really appriciate it. It would be a bummer if my 0.134 bitcoins were lost.
