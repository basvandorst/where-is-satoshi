2fa is USELESS if an attacker nabs your active session cookie and the site isn't set to require entering password and or 2fa again to perform certain actions. A prime example you got blockchain.info open logged in and for convenience you only require authentication to log in but requires NOTHING to spend your coins. The only thing an attacker has to do is steal the session cookie and import it into his browser and the service will use the session cookie to continue the session in progress (Web servers don't usually log ip addresses at this point because the session is already created) thus giving the attacker full access to your account to the point they need to reauthenticate. This is why you hit the logout button instead of just closing the browser as every Web site handles session cookie termination differently and who's to be sure if your cookie has or hasn't been compromised. The defense in the case of bitcoin is to require authentication and or 2fa to spend bitcoins

Aside from the design flaws and the lack of choices there is the statement that the company cares about making mead affordable to the average customer. YET your site's cheapest mead is $35 when I could buy a bottle of mead here for $17 Since when is doubling the price making things affordable? I have this suspicion that those two bitcoin orders were the majority of your sales or you managed to get a bunch of suckerz

And if you have your 2fa saved so you don't have to re - enter your 2fa info for so and so days then all they would have to do is steal the right cookie and the 2fa is bypassed. Don't ever click a box saying something like click here to not enter your Google authenticator code for 30 days.

with all the forum posts he allegedly made shortly I would believe he was a victim of a theft and woudln't be capable of noticing for so long. You don't go asking incredibly basic questions regarding bitcoins and then 20 minutes later create mt gox. Another funny note when mt.gox first started out apparently they were leaking a users username and password in clear text in the URL making your account vulnerable to anyone sniffing out web traffic and even just url's that are being visited on the fly(very easy to accomplish)

Lack of a pin needed to spend the coins was the big reason I use mycelium over this. I DEMAND a thief to NOT ONLY break my phone password but my wallets pin too not just break into my phone and get everything

um isn't coinbase based in the US? and isn't bitstamp in slovenia? correct me if i'm wrong but two  bitcoin exchanges is more then just the one the post implies being the only one in existance even though there are others!
@_date: 2014-12-09 03:50:41
I ditched coinbase after circle. I deleted my coinbase account after they randomly removed my 2fa (wtf coinbase?) btw circle gives instant coins
@_date: 2014-02-17 06:46:09
we do have the famous hackattack and mt.gox to consider. It could be easily plausible to fall a bit farther but im all for the great bitcoin recovery anytime now :)

Its going to be more secure then doing the same on windows at any rate.

Could a mining farm of this size be enough to create a 51% attack or is there really that much hashpower that this is nothing? Mind you I haven't really checked bitcoins current overall hashrate
@_date: 2014-11-24 02:11:35
People will be scared when our mining power goes over 9000!

The title is misleading it made it sounds as if ebay made a patent on how bitcoin exchanges work when its really to do with how thier new wallet is working and the only reason bitcoins was mentioned was because of it being able to be accepted into its wallet which is NOT what the title implies downvoted for that reason

just because an email has legit looking url's doesn't mean the links goto where they say

ban the usd! make bitcoin primary currency!!!!

my only concern regarding such a plan would be the potential of getting that deposit reversed with a chargeback of some sorts. If they make deposits in this fashion permanent id be all for it unless a compelling argument against it can be made.
@_date: 2014-07-25 00:05:21
Turns out saying stupid stuff can have consequences 
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:05:41
and if your session cookie gets stolen no need to enter a password/2fa unless they require either or to withdraw (haven't used bitstamp myself) ive also heard of loopholes in api systems alot of bitcoin services use to steal bitcoins from places. Also this is why you store bitcoins on a personal wallet not on online wallet especially with a large amount of btc.

please let this be a troll post and not some ignorant retard that doesn't seem to get what mt. gox has done lol. I couldn't help but to burst out laughing while doing a double facepalm just seeing a statement of pure ignorance. How many times must people get screwed over before they learn :P
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:01:10
anyone investing with mt gox dispite all the red flags that were being displayed deserve to be treated as dicks. Come on do research with companies/services you are using. There were plenty of red flags. One does not ask basic bitcoin questions and then create mt gox 20 mins afters come on ffs

what sort of magical pony land is this senator in claiming bitcoin enables criminal activitys? Raw cash is used to buy and sell drugs and other illegal activity. Why not ban paper/metal cash

They were slow to give me my coins. And have tried to charge my card twice. I shamefully didn't quite research this company nearly enough as I should have. As just a bit more digging revealed so many reports of worse happenings with them. And a $50 fee for a $250 purchase?

Saying they were no more negligent then Target and Home Depot is a Massive Overstatement. Target had a wildly inferior network without the proper security and didn't give a fuck that everyone had access to everything nor that a company working on equipment that should have been on a separate network rather on the same. 

While the peeps at Home Depot outright knew what was happening and warned the CEO but was told to ignore it. 

At which point had bitstamp followed suit with the same level of negligence the hackers would have gotten everything.

I WILL NOT be EVER setting foot in a target or a home depot they don't deserve to remain open

And to build in BobAlison's questions.

1. Is the safe fire resistant? (when disaster strikes)
2. If the safe is combination safe can you hear the mechanism (my lack of knowledge of safes is probably obvious at this point but I've always seen the old using a stethoscope to listen to the mechanism of the combination lock trick is real or not)
3. Can you make copies in different secure locations and keep an eye on them regularly (paranoia grows at this point)





What kind of printer did you use to print the wallets?
How was the printer connected to the computer?
Which software did you use to generate the private keys?
Where is the safe?


And finally, how many times did you practice making a paper wallet, funding it with a small amount, and successfully spending from it?

If I were insurance companies id find a way to not pay out due to the extreme cases of negligence. I find it hard to belive that Target's setup was PCI compliant and even so would merely render PCI being pointless tbh. Though it would be interesting to see how currencies can get insured. But ya sucks to see companies that at the very least try to do something right get burned while the greedy assholes who just dont give a shit gets paid off. I still say such acts magnify the need of bitcoin to suceed People will have to take security seriously when it means loosing thier goods as opposed to customers.

If your a bitcoin believer I'd say invest as much as your willing to potentially loose (be it in mining gear or coins itself) if going to mine would you be fine to not make any profit and just do it to benefit the network as long as your not going broke? If so definitely invest in bitcoin I wouldn't expect a SHARP decrease of value any time soon

can you guys consider porting mycelium to Ubuntu Phone or Even Windows Phone? Getting a little tired of Google's shitty attitude on Android Developers as of late

I'd have to agree kinda sounds like a biased troll when you're saying that something is bad and can't explain why
