I like them, too. It's because of them that I got to finally meet my long distance girlfriend. And we both met a fellow who worked on the Apollo program.

Oh, that's awful kind of you. I didn't get a message from the bot, but I registered anyway, so we'll see.
Thanks very much, at any rate!

...Hang on, 10 D-coins is a cent now? Christ... I can't believe I'm actually contemplating getting in on this now...

Wait... So everyone who's exchanged BTC for goods and services has been ... lying?
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:01:52
I can't, but I'm buying fractions of a bitcoin little by little. Currently have 30% of one. Progress!

I did that to see if I could cover the cost of a $25 Papa John's Gyft card. It worked, so me and my roommates got essentially free pizza. I didn't dare keep going, though.

Judging by the thumbnail, I was expecting Don Draper to sell me bitcoins. Good article, though. I've certainly been spreading awareness, personally.

That is *such* a neat idea. I wish my workplace did that...

People like knowing they're part of something big and world-changing. And to a certain extent, BTC is definitely changing the world. But in the way that OP is saying? I dunno about that. At any rate, it's an interesting time to be in.

Can I have one? What if I offer a hug in return?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:11:06
This is incredibly accurate.

What bubble? The blasted thing's in decline already. Bubble popped when it hit $900.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:19:00
It actually did collapse. But just down to $800.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:06:44
The biggest. And my hugs are pretty flippin' great. I should know. I give them to myself all the time.
