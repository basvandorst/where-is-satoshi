Well considering I bought 0.5 BTC at $2550:1 BTC. Getting a great deal at the time, about 5 hours ago, there's no fucking way I can sell now..

The thing you investors are overlooking is that BTC is mainly used to buy drugs. People fucking love drugs, ALOT! They're not going to stop buying drugs on the darknet, which means there's always going to be a demand for a cryptocurrency which has a limited supply. Which means that over the long run BTC should increase in value (unless a large percentage of the world start using it as an actual currency, or investment vehicle, in which case we move into a whole different ball park). This recent fluctuation caused by investors is nothing compared to the market for drugs. If ALL the major DN sites like alphabay go down, then you're going to see a decline as pictured, but not for the reasons stated in this graph.

New to R/Bitcoin. Been using bitcoin since SilkRoad. At one point I had 100's of this stuff and spent it all on an 8th of diesel and some cocaine. Not tried it as an investment until now.

Congratulations on surving 23 years. Out of curiosity, any one know if at the current $68bn market cap we have gone past half the ATH market cap? It's pretty interesting, I'd be surprised if all that ~$60bn made it back into fiat. I'd expect a good few $bn just disappeared into nothing.

Do you have a rebuttal as to why my argument is incorrect, as I'd be interested to hear it?

Yeah I bought £1050 worth at the top (0.5BTC). As long as the missus doesn't kill me I'll be holding down to £0.00, or up to £2100. Which ever comes first...

Well, I mean that's great and all. But What if like me you were buying like 3 BTC for ~$200 and then spending the whole amount on DNM. Rinse and repeat to well over 1000 BTC through my fingertips lifetime... Some lessons hit harder than others.

Yeah, it's all relative. Cryptos aren't going to keep you dry in the rain. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose, ever.

It does seem that coinbase has gone down after a dump and right before a price spike twice in recent memory. You could be onto something, whether it's that they can't handle server demand or if it's intentional, it seems that their availability has a fair impact on market value.

People took notice of you becoming interested in the market. Came to the conclusion BTC is doomed, sold.
