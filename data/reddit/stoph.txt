He did publicly state that he immediately cashed out with a value of over $1000. It's sort of like if you accidentally mailed someone a diamond ring instead of a plastic one. There is obvious real world value to the object that was transferred.

It's a domain name system based on bitcoin software.

People can do this for USD/any other currency as well, so I'm not sure what you're getting at. For the record, I hardly think government regulation is a solution here.

I think your idea for a new network is flawed if you can just give away coins to people who meet certain criteria. One of the great features of bitcoin is that a single organization can't just give coins away for free.

Or people could just keep their bitcoins in a safe place. Storing your bitcoins on Mt Gox is a bad idea because you're putting all your trust in a 3rd party that hasn't earned your trust. Storing your wallet on your own PC is a bad idea if you run Windows.
If MasterCard allowed you to store your bitcoins with them, many people would use it because financial companies are generally good with keeping your money safe. If you want to make purchases, MasterCard could "release" funds to your local wallet, with verification like a cell phone text, e-mail, etc. If their algorithms decide the behavior is unusual, your account could be flagged and a service representative could give you a phone call to check up on the activity before releasing funds.

The thing is, it seems like there's no shortage of consumers ready to trust any random, new exchange.

Anyone can start their own payment service with Bitcoin, there's nothing tying people to Mt. Gox or any other provider besides the fact that some are more widely used than others.
If someone came out with an exchange/payment service that was superior, people would switch to it.
In addition, nothing is wrong with sending coins directly when you want to do a simple cash handoff.

You have 1.23b4 coins. I like it.

I couldn't care less what a bitcoin is worth as long as it finds a stable range.
The utility in bitcoin is paying for things without having to go through the big credit card monopoly.

Exactly. He could have encrypted the data and stored it on S3 for pennies on the dollar.

That's true, but you can trade it on any exchange that decides to offer the service.

If he knows the identity of the recipient, it would be fun to see how it played out in small-claims court.
