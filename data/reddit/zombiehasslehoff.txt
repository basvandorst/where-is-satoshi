Long time Sundance Volunteer here, Can't Wait! Keep us updated if you get accepted. 
There was a guy on the AR15 Forums selling December/January to make a movie, was that you?

I think the best thing to do would be to donate to the bitcoin foundation and the Devs so the next bug can be fixed promptly. Keep in mind that development will trickle down to doge.

- mp3, video, or anything that would use DRM.
You get a coin when you buy a song or whatever. Now you can prove that you own it no matter what device you use. When you get a new computer or phone, sign a message with that address to prove you own it. You are also free to sell it to the next guy when you're done with it.

Assuming you mean 50 paper wallets to give away. I recommend making the wallets at bitaddress.org and then with electrum you can import a transaction in comma separated value format in either .csv or text. This way you can send the btc to all the addresses in one transaction and pay only one tx fee.

I don't have any fancy contacts, I keep my responsibility there as little as possible so I can see as many films as possible. I will ask around and see if there is anything I can do. 
But seeing that your film is already funded and looks like the filming is mostly done, you should have no problem getting in. It also looks like a perfect fit for Sundance. Just be ready to submit what you have finished or unfinished by the deadline. Most of the smaller films are still editing and even filming a few weeks before it starts and some are still editing during the festival.

I think it will be very significant as well. The more I think about it, everything could be done in the client, the end user may never need to know they are using bitcoin/colored coins.
It could also lead to decentralized distribution and let artists be less reliant on record labels and services like itunes that only pay a fraction of a cent per song.
But on the other hand creating a second hand market would also leave the door open to digital theft.

 - Groupbuys, Kickstarters, and fundraising. 
Each share/product purchased gets a coin. If you get tired of waiting for the preorder or need cash, sell it. the new owner can sign a message to prove they own it and tell the issuer to change the shipping address if they need to.

Have a professional look over the terms and conditions you agreed to when you opened the account. If nothing states you have to cover fraudulent deposits, close your account. 
If they put it on your credit report you have the right to get proof that you owe them the money. If they cant provide proof in 30 days you can have it taken off your credit reports.
Also, get everything in writing, don't deal with them over the phone. Tell them it's inconvenient to talk over the phone and that you want to work over US Mail.

They need to make an example of someone for “deterrence”. It's the same thing that they planned for Aaron Swartz.

Long time festival volunteer checking in. Sounds awesome, I'd love to help. I'm already scheduled to work most of the festival but I would like to help out where I can. PM me if you want some extra help or just want advice on Park City during the festival.
