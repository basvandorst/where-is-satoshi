Bottom Line Up Front: Cash settlement is just for the futures contracts, there is no practical reason traders won’t go to the market directly to influence or protect their contracts concurrently.
While the futures will be cash settled without a hard settlement link to the BTC as a commodity, the systemic risk (risk you’d find in other markets) is that large players or institutions will influence the price of BTC via participation in the exchanges using large buys/sells to influence the spot price on the BTC futures, which they can trade with more leverage to generate outsized returns.
I don’t think they’ll be long-term successful because there are too many other large institutions &amp; whales who can rock the boat (check out game theory or “prisoner’s dilemma”). Having said that, I fully expect several to try and succeed in the short run. But bottom line is, just because it is cash settled does not preclude participants from going into BTC directly to influence price. In fact, they kind of need to go into BTC to hedge against a runaway movement on the opposite side of their position since the futures plan on daily limit up and limit down movements.
Great Question, btw... it has absorbed much of my free time looking into it and trying to figure it out, lol. Best of luck
