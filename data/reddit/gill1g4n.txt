Welcome to 2018. In this generation of what we call internet, there's a site called YouTube. So if there's one thing you can take away in his garage is that KNAWWWLEDGE is key to ~~exploit people~~ success.

In terms of practical application, Bitcoin has already provided the inception that it has the potential to change centralized corrupted systems to be decentralized for ordinary people. It's got flaws but it has survived up till this point and as long as development continues for it, it doesn't need to be applicable for anything else because it became the catalyst for other coins and platforms to also step up and change the financial world. In 10 years from now, conducting micro transactions will be so different, I don't think Bitcoin will be part of the picture but it will always be known as the grandfather of cryptocurrencies while the father will be some platform in this new paradigm shift which other platforms will derive on. Bitcoin however will still be considered a store of value just like Gold. We don't transact with gold bars to buy a coffee but we respect this metal just as we will respect Bitcoin that made it possible to empower communities, knowledge and freedom in a decentralized system.
