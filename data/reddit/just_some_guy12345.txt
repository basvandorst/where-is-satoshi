4. CREDITED AT 1.06 AM EST
5. ORIGINAL COINS NOT RELEASED TO EXCHANGE UNTIL 2018-02-20 12:16:23 EST TIME
So basically I was paid with someone else's money (since my coins were still stuck @ noon). 
This is a problem if changelly is not liquid and is not doing FIFO exchanging.
They run into the issue of waiting for funds to pay people, but don't seem to respect the spot price when doing so.
I'm not sure if they're doing funny business w/the timestamp being obfuscated between UCT, EST, AM/PM or if it was all a coincidence...but if it quacks like a duck...
If I saved you money and want to help me get whole again:BTC

My main beef here is the "taking gains" definition when I haven't cashed out and most coins I own aren't even useable in 99.99% of merchants.
Taxable events should be tied to Fiat or purchase of goods/services not when having fun with fungability.
