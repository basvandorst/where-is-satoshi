I'm the Assistant Executive Director of Bitcoin ... AMA.

I remember realizing this when I was 12 years old and thought it was hella shady.

We need to start money bombing these leakers.
They do a MASSIVE service for society... and they're often neglected.  The lawyer bills ALONE justify it... but if you take such a risk, you should be able to at least enjoy the rest of your life without having to worry about a bullet in your head.

holy shit. To me that sounds worse than anything above.

pro-tip... The federal government STILL hates you if you smoke marijuana.  If you buy pot with a CC you're going to go into an NSA database and are going to be flagged.  This could have a negative impact on your life .... 
PAY WITH CASH... if you have to, walk around the corner and go to the ATM.
It's not worth it...

There's plenty of tax evasion right now in cash... And other commodities I might add.  All illegal drug sales are in cash and none of it is paid to uncle sam.

yeah.. I'm gonna buy things on Overstock ...

It's not an investment. It's speculation 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:50:49
maybe someone needs to end up in prison.
Also, if I were these gentlemen, I'd be worried for my life.  People get killed for shit like this for a LOT less.

Or you can just sell arms illegally to the Iranians and then funnel that money to the Contras (terrorists) ... all using the US dollar.
Cash is king baby!

The last time I went to a bank it was Chase bank to deposit cash for my GF.
It was a pain in the ass to get to... they closed at 4pm (at least this branch did) and I had to hurry to get there. 
It was about a 20 minute walk and I didn't have a car because I was out of town.
... so I get there... and low and behold they stopped taking "anonymous" cash deposits 2 days beforehand.
So fuck Chase!

Also, if any of you invent a time machine.  Please go back in time before I post this comment.

the CC *they* are using?  I would pay with bitcoin, and they would send the product.

Read Emmanuelle Kant.  There is a lengthy discussion on this.
What if you controlled a train.  The train will two either of two directions.  You can't stop the train because of its momentum.
On one track is your daughter.  On the other is a complete stranger.
Both are bound to the track.
I assume you would save your daughter?  Most people would make this decision.
Now what if there are TEN people on the other track.  All of which would die.
It become more complicated doesn't it?
Your question was a softball.. My point being that ethics are very complicated.  It isn't as simple as you would suggest.
@_date: 2012-10-25 18:25:29
Not if they find it in a mass bust.
IF they bust someone they will record the serial numbers and then when your report it stole you will eventually get it back (if they find it).
In this situation they would look up your name, see that you didn't pay taxes on it, and I guess auction it off .... 
@_date: 2012-10-25 14:48:25
Wouldn't surprise you? This is EXACTLY what will happen.
They will marijuanify it like they *attempted* to do with crypto.
The marijuanification of crypto is still pending.  The only reason they haven't yet is that most people don't use crypto so wire tapping still works.
If Google presses the issue with SPDY then ALL Internet communication will be encrypted and the US will FREAK.
If it's only a minority of people using bitcoin then it won't be a problem.
Further, I can still see plenty of ways governments can make money. 
They can tax large transactions for example.  Cars, houses, etc.  You won't be able to get tags for you car, real estate insurance, etc without proof that you paid tax.
Further, the government can just demand that you prove proof of tax payment if you want to file a stole property report.
So if you have your precious laptop stolen but didn't pay taxes they can tell you to fuck off.
... and why shouldn't they.  You're not paying for police protection...

Take some of the money and use it for some good.  Ethical problem solved.
Seriously.  There are no PERFECT solutions to some of these problems.
Everything you do will have SOME negative ethical repercussions.  
Find something good to do with the money.  Help orphans.  Save the environment.   This will help offset any negative ethical externalities.

The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
@_date: 2013-06-27 22:11:17
Well, the $50 you owe them (or are loaning them) could be motivation for getting bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-06-27 22:09:46
I realized that that in retrospect that this kind of sounds obvious... But the network effect that banks have can really be crushed with bitcoin.
Now I don't need a bank for a corporate wire transfer... I don't need one to send money to friends and family.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:32:29
I think OP was trying to point out that this is short term instability.
When the US was founded we couldn't even get a line of credit from other nations.  It was a BITCH for us to get credit and have our currency taken seriously.  
That eventually faded.. bitcoin is PARTLY fiat because at the end of the day you DO have to believe that the platform is secure from cryptographic attacks and is generally sound.
I think one of the biggest obstacles is that we are only NOW just coming to terms with keeping sensitive data online.
LOTS of people get their gmail accounts phished, forget to make backups, etc.
Imagine if you had your WHOLE savings in bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-07-25 05:02:22
anti-trust/anti-competitive behavior!
@_date: 2013-10-16 05:12:12
yeah... good job dude.  I LITERALLY thought it was your title and got confused for a moment.
Predicting the future is confusing.

Further, the USD is used for PLENTY of illegal transactions... If anything. Bitcoin is JUST catching up to USD because BEFORE this you couldn't send cash through the Internet.  
How many BILLIONS of dollars in USD change hands per year due to illegal drugs, arms, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:04:29
It's fascinating to see how this plays out.
There is a good deal of existing infrastructure based on existing currencies.  I imagine when Bitcoin starts to threaten them and take away their business that they are going to lobby hard to shut it down.
However, these countries should BENEFIT from an alternative to the Euro and USD so I doubt they will push to outlaw it... 
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:54:35
1.  Perhaps bitcoin will get big enough for people to have dedicated hardware wallets.  
2.  That will be solved soon enough.  It's called network effects.
3.  That will be fixed too.
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:43:50
The instability of bitcoin is the biggest issue and I think a valid criticism.  This will eventually settle down though... it's only a matter of time.
@_date: 2013-07-29 15:02:01
This is why the alcohol license laws are still on the books.  It's more about bribery and legal pressure than about safety.
@_date: 2013-06-27 22:10:39
Except instant online wire transfers.
Wells fargo has been helpful to my niece and I because if she's in trouble and needs lunch money or something I can send her money instantly.
Now I can have her ditch WF and use bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-07-09 21:47:56
arbitrage I imagine... not many people know how to use bitcoin or have access to computers and/or easy to use wallets (like on their phone).
@_date: 2013-05-13 05:22:43
My shop has an ATM in the hall. 
Most people DO NOT want this to show up on their bank as they prefer to remain anonymous - myself included.
But bitcoin DOES solve this problem... it's just not as massive as we think.
@_date: 2013-08-28 18:26:53
Never underestimate the power of governments to fuck things up for a hundred years or so.
Sure... freedom is inevitable.  But they're going to fucking drag it out forever.
Slavery, the war on drugs, the minority vote, etc.
@_date: 2013-02-19 05:02:25
BTW. I'm sure this isn't just illegal download sites.
I'm sure Google is trying to cut off spammers and malware.  
Many of these are organized crime.  Don't underestimate HOW important it is to cut them off.  
This is actually a downside of bitcoin but it could be implemented in bitcoin if you wanted to have a block list...  but it would be up to the clients to implement it.

Theft is one anyone can understand.  If your laptop is stolen, the inability for the criminals to access the data is an important feature.
