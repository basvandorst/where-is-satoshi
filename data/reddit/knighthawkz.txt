Lenovo is crazy.. Owned by the Chinese Government and they arent pressed for the profits. They have a long term strategy and therefore their prices are some of the best you can find at the moment. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:36:57
A LOT of people lost money because of this.
@_date: 2014-05-11 03:19:13
Can't lose if you don't play. Sound strategy that.
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:46:33
Yup why did they change?
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:18:08
Ah you weren't the only one to miss the short but prosperous spree of bitcoin millionaire!
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:15:33
Why not both?

So their size would make them more susceptible to large moves no? If you compare BTC to a similar market cap, you may find it more difficult to find a market that moves like it, something the earlier user was likely tryong to say
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:05:42
Hahahaha man, hodl! Let me know when your buying next so I know a dip is coming ✌️
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:24:02
Correct me if wrong, but they are pretty much penny stocks, with trading volume far less then BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:35:15
Hahaha great video!

Bad economic policies killed it. Socialism was doing just fine when they balanced with 100$ oil.. the issue is Venezuela didn't make an alternative plans when the price plummeted. they were one of the wealthiest nations while being socialist.

Yeah very true. But history is written by the victors.. not just the good guys. I hope we are tight and can win out in this. But we will get attacked by people with heavy weapons. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:49:49
A lot of hotheads with this correction. People seeing their profits being eaten will lash out and be stressed

So... Why does everyone use banks if we all don't trust banks?
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:44:19
Fair point. But isint all of the western world built on debt too? I mean we are literally printing money for the last 10 years to cover the fuck up that was 2008... As a collective capitalism has covered itself. Everyone agreed it was ok to print money. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:32:15
Yikes, someone sold the dip...
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:48:11
Very scammy. Used it years ago getting fresh in the game. Was a noob. They lock positions, very much a broker that screws the user to make money.

Those countries have massively divested away from oil... They have global portfolios of property and shares all the while creating themselves as hubs for tech company talent. They have done well playing the game. External market forces will always be far too much for one socialist country to overcome. That's why China have adopted a hybrid model. A purely socialist state that depends on capitalist countries for resources is doomed to fail. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:16:20
It's hardly due to socialism... They depended on oil as their main source of foreign currency.

It's a dropplet in the ocean that is the bitcoin markets.

Thanks man! Nice chunk of money between the 650 crash and then the spike to 850. :)

Fellow aib user here.. For the last 4 year I've had no fees because of student account! I dread the future!
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:09:59
Let me just look into my crystal ball
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:54:08
"Rebuys at 1k" And today was the day that that was possible!
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:44:31
Who do you bank with? And is it a full account? ie not student or graduate which i am atm.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:56:28
The market for banks is small in Ireland and they all have similar fees. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:05:15
Is there any site that is built for that?
Edit: ?
Edit2: Im using one that deals in contracts but real bitcoin would be better.
