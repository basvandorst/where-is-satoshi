Thanks, that I didn't know that. Interesting.

1btc is 23k in my local currency. A lot of people can't afford that, but are still able to invest a few thousand. They get percentage returns so it doesn't matter the starting amount. As long as it's &gt; 100 then fees don't really matter. 
The fees are still less then booker fees if investing in the stock market.
Also, *if bitcoin doubles*, what? if you hold for a year or two it goes ten fold. $100=$1000, not bad.

[Localbitcoins]( The website acts as a 3rd party, while you trade directly with people using bank transfers. They hold bitcoin securely in escrow while you make the payment so it's quite safe. Depending on the seller they may require id, but each seller makes their own rules. Prices can be a bit higher then other exchanges.

Banks don't even process online transfers between banks on the weekends. It sits in the queue and waits until 10am Monday morning. But all their internet banking is an automated system, so why delay it?
Even scheduled automatic payments between accounts on the same bank are delayed until the working week. Found this out trying to make an automatic rent payment on Sunday.

There is not dark side, as the sun is able to light all sides of the moon, when it is a new moon, the sun is lighting the part we can't see. However we only see one side the moon (southern hemisphere included, we just see it ~~upside down~~ right way up.) because it is tidally locked to the earth.

Also as a long time user of a full node behind a firewall, I've finally bothered to port forward as of yesterday. Using /Satoshi:0.15.1/ However I prune to a 5GB tip, so can't provide network services.

[this]( has also come out in the nzHerald, however they have the worst reputation of any NZ media and I think it was only published online, so hopefully the damage is mitigated.

What wallet are you using? If you can export private keys, then do this on all addresses that may have contained bitcoins at the time of the fork. Then to be safe, I would sent you bitcoins to a new address but this not strictly necessary. Now take your exported private keys and import them into a bcash wallet, you should see that your balance contains an equivalent amount of bcash to bitcoin at the time of the fork.
Now send to exchange and turn into bitcoins.
I did this with Bitcoin core as my primary wallet then using Bcash electrum to import. Works great, note that bcash has rely protection so separating them is quite easy.
Now in future hard forks, use the get unspent outputs command as the fork happens so you don't have to go hunting through all your addresses to find your forked balance. Did this with Bitcoin Gold, remember to get that one as well.

Radio and light are the same thing - electromagnetic radiation. Radio is a much longer wavelength, on the order of meters, where as visible light is ~400-700nanometers. There wavelength / frequency have no effect on the speed they travel - c, 3x10^8 m/s

Wow, I didn't realise we had an New Zealand exchange and have been using localbitcoins after coinbase was like we don't sell there

Bitcoin Core (or another full client) for maximum security and decentralisation.
Whatever you decide on, make sure you verify the download by checking the signed checksum and search the wallet name followed by 'scam' to check it's not a fake wallet.
Or go hardware wallet if it's large amounts.

In New Zealand, I have an interest free student loan so investing any extra makes sense, pay back more with the interest earned. However, where are these people getting the extra. I'm only allowed to take out a maximum amount per week and that all goes into rent and food.
And if you have a loan that you pay interest on, forget it. Just try to minimise the loan amount.

Just run a full node on the pi, justifying the power. Then it the fanciest full node I've every seen.

For buying things, it's up to the shop which unit they display but some already use mbits as well.

I doubt this will happen, there is a greater motivator to get badly made insecure devices out quickly be first to the market. Once this happens on a large scale, the entire internet infrastructure with have to be hardened against ddos attacks (DNSSEC is a good start.), there will be outages and public out cry. Then I can see something like energy ratings but for security coming along.
