Fees are based on the number of transactions. Fees have been high for a while and now trading volume just went crazy with the south Korean news. Fees are usually lowest late night Sunday. This is why there is so much interest in the lightning network since it will make fees negligible.

I'm no expert, but it looks like the entire block your transaction is in hasn't been confirmed yet. You just kinda have to wait. *shrug*

So the private key has to be of a certain length and limited characters, then get the public key and then sha256, then ripemd160 and that's you're address if I understand correctly.
You'll need to do more research.

I won't be mad about selling.... my BCash for Bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:47:59
Hopefully even lower. Just means I can buy more.

To add to this and to echo what Andreas has said, support a crypto that shares your values and that you believe in. The number of cryptos will just keep growing, but all of us as a community get to decide which is most useful and valuable.

Maybe Forbes was right even though it got the direction wrong, lol!

That would be the coolest thing ever if the explosion had the btc symbol shoot out!

Obviously his aim wasn't to do harm, but he also appears to be willing to risk physical harm for financial gains. So he's a sociopath not a psychopath. Which doesn't make it much better.

Switch banks and remove all your money. It's the only language banks understand.

I would like to point out that Forbes predicted 10k by Christmas as a bubble, not a correction.

That's what I would tell people publicly too if I were them... 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:34:32
Fair enough. I was thinking more along the lines of "Hey if you continue this policy, I will have to switch to a different bank/credit union." anyway. I wouldn't personally have any kind of loyalty to a bank, but I understand where you are coming from.

I see little violation of libertarian ideals by condemning this guy's actions. Honesty and upholding a contract between freely associating individuals is vital. At very least he violated this contract by shipping something that carriers do not want to handle. I think as a libertarian you could argue whether the government should have applied legal penalty against him with no one actually having been hurt, but that doesn't make it any less of a shitty thing to have done.

The way I understand it, coupled with segwit, it is an IOU that either party can resolve on demand. In fact I don't know if an IOU is the best analogy since with an IOU, the person can just disappear or decide to not pay. LN is more like a signed and notarized contractual agreement with the house put up as collateral.

This will be one of those things that people look back on and just laugh at. Like articles how no one would want a personal computer or that the internet is just a fad.

I am basing my opinion on my gut so it's not worth much, but I think you have it backwards. Bitcoin is on the rise because the US markets are at a high right now. If (when) there is another 2008, bitcoin will crash with the rest of the economy.
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:01:50
It's a risky play, but good luck!

My first sentence literally said it was a gut feeling. However, I am comparing the markets to bitcoin for the past 6 months. Pull up graphs of the DJIA, NYSE, etc and compare it to bitcoin. Bitcoin is following the market, not the other way around.
The markets have been reacting favorably to Trumps presidency as business acts more bullish to the idea of tax cuts, cutting of regulations, etc. More investment means more jobs, which means more disposable income, which pushes markets up and opens the opportunity for more individual investments and therefore more money pushed into bitcoin.
I don't believe the fundamentals have changed much however which means there will be a large correction causing many non-enthusiast bitcoin holders to exit for something safer. Bitcoin's correction will be two fold too since a downturn in the economy means less purchasing in general which lowers its value.
I don't think Greece's affect on bitcoin is very comparable to a US recession/depression would have, but I'm not even disagreeing completely. Uncertainty can definitely push bitcoin up higher, but I'm arguing that it is only true up until a point.
Again, just my opinion!
