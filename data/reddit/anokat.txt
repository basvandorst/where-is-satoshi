Bitcoin is a trojan horse for a lot of things. Obviously also for learning privacy, to not get hacked/harassed/begged/extorted/robbed by everyone who knows you are now a millionaire. Besides learning about IT in general (avoid malware, encrypt, have backups etc), economy, politics, heck, a lot of the stuff the world works from.
Welcome to our favorite collection of rabbitholes! The one with privacy is important, as you can't un-do failed privacy later on. So yes, go for it, now!

Nice startingpoints, thanks!


Do you have 100% privacy in your digital life? :-)
I'd only like to add: 
first of all, define who and what you want to protect against. You need different approaches to try to be safe against automated malware and spam, personalized attacks from criminals or state-level actors.
second, use different aliases! Several e-mail-adresses, several reddit-accounts, several nicknames depending on context. Which is surprisingly tough to do, as eventually those will overlap (in real world, at least).
OpSec is fun! It's like mental martial arts. See, how far you could get defending against (online) state-level attackers. You'll learn a lot about IT, and will probably end with good backups, a working disaster recovery plan, better privacy than 99%, and a James-Bond/Hacker-feeling too :-)
know of a place where OpSec/InfoSec is discussed in a coherent and enjoyable way? Have facebook? :-P

Play the long game, wait until bitcoin took over the world, rub it into the nose of your professor, and throw him a few satoshis :-)

Definitely not. It's taxable, as "~~gelt werter~~  geld werter vorteil", aka "money-value gains".
