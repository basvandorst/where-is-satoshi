If you buy a lottery ticket, you have a chance at making 1,000,000 times your investment, or you could lose $1. With those odds it doesn't make sense not to buy lottery tickets.

Excellent summary, thanks. I think there's a lot more to this story, and it might take months for all the details to come to light. I feel sorry for those who lost money, but I'm fascinated by the story. It's like watching a documentary in real time.

Everyone knows Satoshi is Nick Szabo. We just pretend not to because we prefer Satoshi to be some anonymous Guy Fawkes mask wearing supergenius leading a revolution from his impenetrable bunker. 
There is mythology surrounding Satoshi, and most would like his identity to never be confirmed, especially if her prefers to stay hidden. I personally think that the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto brings an element of interest and intrigue to bitcoin.
But the fact is almost all reputable evidence points to Szabo.
