In the U.K. (we're special friends don't you know) you would not be able to spend a $10 note anywhere but a currency kiosk e.t.c.  
The notion you could do it anywhere else in Europe is also totally incorrect, as would saying the same for the Yen here or in Europe, or the Euro in the U.S.A. or back in China.

@_date: 2018-01-27 16:45:11
Missing my point. 
If this becomes the norm, think of every different company you transact with and having a wallet and associated different tokens for them.  
Wake up, use banking apps to pay whatever, do online shopping, pay with amazon coin, pop to supermarket, use Aldi coin, want a sausage roll, Greggs coin. Used Parking coin to park car, need to fill car up on way home use Texaco coin. 
No one is going to do this when it's not easier than cash, even with the problems FIAT brings cos most people don't give a fuck. 
Edit:  Also, which of these will get hacked first?  Because we all know none of these will actually run on a blockchain, it will be spreadsheets just like Ripple does.  Good luck with that. Be a wolf. Not the sheep.

Your shit might be tight right now, but FIAT is the true mirage.
People calling Bitcoin a bubble while dismissing trillions upon trillions of FIAT debt, debt which can’t and won’t ever be paid back. 
Quantitative easing ‘saved’ us from the 2009 crash, zero level interest rates and enough money printed to start the economy twice over in some countries. Have the banks changed since then??? 
Bitcoin may fail on a technical level, FIAT is 100% headed for zeroville. There is no other path for it to take.

Basically, the gubberment that so many people seem to love, steal your money through taxation, to keep their special friends in power and control at the cost of the whole of humanity.
Until their monopoly is broken, this will continue to be the way.
Some people are happy to live on their knees, others have had enough of it.
You can't beat the gubb with violence, that's also another monopoly it controls.  We can however restrict their power, and with Bitcoin this can be achieved, without violence.
When you see the gubbermint going after people who are rocking their nice little boat, it should wake you up as to where their real loyalties and passions lie.
For many a moon that has not been with the people, and we need to start the end of this utter bullshit.

Unless I'm wrong there aren't even any blueprints for the next gen, let alone the funding/pre-order BS that goes with new machinery.
Only thing that will make the hashrate significantly increase will be when BTC starts to rise in price and some of the 'smaller' miners decide to turn their rigs back on.

I own an IPhone 5. At the time it ticked all the boxes of my required needs.
If Apple continue to disallow wallets with send/receive capability, one of my largest needs from a phone will be gone.
Not everyone with an Apple product is a sheep.
I truly believe however that as Btc adoption continues to grow the above factor will ring true for many a user.  
Apple have already seen the backlash from this community - many will say 'so 50 odd people decided to switch from the 2nd wealthiest company in existence today - they don't care!'
Today 50 people, tomorrow 500 etc etc etc.

I'd just like to wish all Bitcoiners a good weekend.
This sub can be very grr-y at times, and yes, if you want something else go to another sub.  I just wanted to share a little thought.
For the weekend - don't spend every second looking at the charts or arguing with the trolls, go out and do something different.  
Spend time with friends, get that DIY you've needed doing for months done, it will make you feel much better.  
Once you've sorted all the neccessarys come back and play with Bitcoin, she'll be alright if you take a break for a couple of days.  
When I first properly 'got' Btc last year it completely took over my life.  I wasn't sleeping properly, eating anything and everything became about transactions/hashrate/exchange volumes. This was not healthy!
Thankfully this year I've taken it upon myself to get my shit in order.  Got myself a decent job, working out, paying debts off and getting life heading in the right direction.  My only regret is leaving it so long to do this (now the ripe old age of 31!)
I say this because although I will forever be Perma-Bull for Btc, there is still that 0.1% it could fail.  
Don't make Btc your life, make living your icecream, let Btc be the cherry.
Much love

After a stable month or so of exchange price, the bottom was found (been called at $430, seems agreeable). 
In the last 2 weeks you've had announcements such as the Bitpay valuation and subsequent investment, the Buffet of Asia boosting Bitcoin, Budweiser announcing their partnership with Coinbase and finally the Ebay CEO tweeting 'Bitcoin is the future, and they are actively looking to integrate it'.
If that isn't enough reason to think adoption is going to increase, and therefore so will the future price (if not the price today) through supply and demand, then I don't know what will?

Completely disagree. If the protocol was utter turd it would have been found out by now. And for something so both 'useless' and 'worthless' it seems many a person is trying to steal it. 
I have an oak tree in my garden, therefore I have many an acorn. They will grow into trees one day, but how useful is that to you or anyone else, and how many people are trying to get in my garden to take those acorns? The answer is none, because those acorns are both limitless in number, readily available, and only useful for one thing.
The blockchain is not. It cannot be replicated, can't be forged. It's ethics can be copied, but, and I think this is the key point for all crypto's, the power of it's network won't ever be beaten.
I see Btc as the virus of Crypto, the more it touches the more it spreads.

Supernintendo Lawsky has already asked for people to submit their exchange plans to him, this leads to a regulated exchange.  Then Wall Street money flows in.
Besides this, the technology and infrastructure being built around the protocol is gaining traction.  The currency is trick number 1, and the lowliest to be pulled from the hat.  It needed this however for the VC's and developers to take their time and money to invest in it.
The protocol solves a problem in computing which we aren't going to now un-solve.  It has been stated in many other subreddits how Btc does better than existing technologies before it, and this is the reason it will continue to grow.
What an earth are you going to do with your life IF Btc hit's $10,000???

Why the Bitcoin?
'Like you can't conceive of a world without the Internet today, five years from now you won't be able to conceive of a world without the Bitcoin. Right now, people are apprehensive of it, but they don't want to condemn it or write it off. The Bitcoin intrigued me because it could trigger a big change in the way business is done. It would make money transfer through Visa, MasterCard, Western Union and banks redundant since all you would need is the click of a key. Virgin Atlantic and Zynga are pioneers in accepting Bitcoin payments'

After April 15th, China no longer gets to play 'it's banned/it's not banned'.
For the week after this those Chinese who are desperate still to sell (for the life of me I no longer understand those who are buying for speculation terms without 1 iota of comprehension on where the protocol is going, and then sell a week later at a loss but hey ho), which I'm guessing will lead to the final drop in price. 
Around the end of this month, the crazy Chinese will be out, those that had to sell to cover their taxes will be done, and I can't really see much other 'bad news' that is going to drop prices by 10% a day or more (barring a catastrophe such as the internetz being turned off): Here you have the bottom. 
From there on the only way is up, however, without people working to make it happen (making the killer apps, supporting the ecosystem) it won't do it by magic.
Instead of just buying and Hodling, a lot better advice would be use your knowledge to spread the usefulness of this technology.    
Sitting in the exchanges watching the price does NOTHING for bitcoin.

Pretty much, yes. Because it would come and go. No other virtual currency has got as large as bitcoin in either the network behind it securing it or its market cap.
Tell me what you think the beater of Btc will be, what 'features' it has and it is more than likely there are already 2 or 3 alts with exactly that.  
All you need to do now is get everyone to use it, mine it, and you've beaten Bitcoin.
1. Make alt coin
2. Beat Btc
3. ????
4. Profit

This is the  troll failure.  
You measure Bitcoin's success on BTC/$, and when doing this, you seem only to be able to do this by comparing today's price to its A.T.H .  
Daily transactions, nodes on network, number of companies taking it: irrelevant to you.  
Things in the pipeline, looking at the bigger picture, thinking outside the box - troll cannot compute.
You score 11/10 for Fail.

TL;DR:  
We divide our data into two periods: May-September 2013 and October 2013-February 2014. In the first period, Bitcoin's price was relatively stable, while in the second period it was very volatile.
We find that in the first period, Bitcoin's popularity (as measured by exchange rates) increased agains't the USD and other cryptocurrencies.  But in the second period, the price of other cryptocurrencies increased even more against the USD than Bitcoin did.  In our interpretation of these results, it seems that on the one hand Bitcoin, via it's initial popularity, "opened up" the market for cryptocurrencies in general.  At the same time, it enjoys a first-mover advantage in an environment with network effects.  In the long term, it is not clear whether this advantage will be sufficient to keep the dominant position.  Recently, Litecoin, the second strongest digital currency, has increased in popularity not only in trading but also in acceptance.  Businessweek.com reported on 24 April that Litecoin is increasingly more often accepted by merchants as a lower cost alternative to Bitcoin.
The analysis of exchanges for cryptocurrencies indicated few or no arbitrage opportunities, and any existing arbitrage opportunities decline from the first to the second period.  Given the different nature of the network effects - involving negative same-side effects - and no arbitrage opportunities, many exchanges coexist in the long run, and possibly compete on various fees.

No pyramid, you could have miners selling to those who prefer to use Btc for transactions. 
They then use to pay suppliers, so on and so forth.

Whatsapp sold for $19Bil
Beats sold for $3Bil
Bitcoin current market cap $4.8Bil
With Whatsapp you can send free messages, Beats sells overpriced headphones (I own the studios).
Bitcoin allows anyone, anywhere to be banked, to send/receive value with an internet connection (in some cases just a mobile phone number).
If you think Bitcoin is slightly more useful than Whatsapp, now is a good time to buy.

A protocol cannot be stopped, it is clear that other countries are not banning it (anyone know last time a country taxed an illicit something?).  Whilst they continue to do this Bitcoin grows elsewhere.  
By banning it they are just giving everyone else a head start on the innovation game, and pushing developers and those involved in the space elsewhere.  This is a good thing when you consider how far ahead of everyone else they are regarding electronics e.t.c.

@_date: 2014-10-25 12:47:33
I look forward to the time when Bitcoin matures, this will be reflected in it's price.
Then this question will no longer be asked.
If you believe Btc is going to be the universal currency, gold 2.0, basis of future smart contracts: the price today is irrelevant, and ROI will come in time.
Yes, as the Btc price is at the bottom/near to it the numbers make a loss.
Come back in 2 years time and ask if anyone who mined during 2014 made ROI.

 For that many coins, you need a hardware wallet- look up Trezor or Nano wallet. 
If this is true, you're now the owner of a lot of coin/money. 
Imagine going on Facebook and telling your friends you'd won the lottery - people will be expecting a share of your riches. Many will see that you've 'got lucky'. My advice, learn what you have and how to secure it before you even start thinking about moving/selling/storing them.

Fake recovery.
Everyone saying "buy the dip" is giving you malicious advice and looking for you to lose more money.
This happened the previous 3 times and looks exactly like what happened in 2013.
Dump will resume and this time it will go below the previous low. 
This will close sub $800 (being REALLY optimistic here) in January.
We won't retest $900, let alone $1k, anytime soon. Perhaps not for years.

History shows us:
@_date: 2014-04-30 16:21:04
The word 'Why'.
My reasons:
• This is usually followed with a momentously stupid question answered not only a million times previous in this subreddit but also by the sidebar. &gt; 
• The word 'why' denotes a wanton lack of self education. For the time it took them to ask here, they could have typed the same into Googlez and read the answer. It's very much a 'give me a TL;DR' because I can't be arsed to learn it myself.
• As much as I love this subreddit and are grateful to the knowledge posted here, you need to remember that it is only another human posting, and humans are fallible creatures. Not everything posted here is gospel, and I encourage people to do their own research if so interested enough in the subject.
Yes, I realise there is no harm in asking questions, generally it means people are interested: this a good thing.

As does anyone hating on anything they don't truly understand, or have opinions on matters and when asked 'why do you think like that' can't actually give you a decent answer, these people are not critical thinkers, their advice is not worth taking, they deserve nothing and thankfully that is what they will end up with.

Much more than digital cash
The rise and fall of the crypto-currency is good news for authors at least
Jan 10th 
BITCOIN may well be the world’s worst-performing currency. In 2014 it lost more than half of its value against the dollar, beating even Ukraine’s hryvnia and the Russian rouble. But measured by the number of new books it has inspired, bitcoin is top of the pile. Nearly 200 titles about the crypto-currency came out last year, according to Amazon. Another dozen will hit the shelves in the coming months.
Be warned, though, some are pretty bad. Brian Kelly, an investment manager and talking head on CNBC, takes several stabs in “The Bitcoin Big Bang” at explaining how the crypto-currency works, only to confuse the reader with his odd metaphors: “Let’s call the first bitcoin a socialite named Genesis.” Dominic Frisby is a comedian and a financial writer who in an earlier book outed himself as an anarcho-capitalist. In “Bitcoin: The Future of Money?” he suggests that bitcoin will change the world as we know it because governments will be unable to raise money for long wars if the currency is widely adopted. “It is a force for peace,” Mr Frisby insists.
For any book on bitcoin to be worth reading, though, it has to delve further: into the crypto-currency’s ideological and technical roots, for instance, or what it adds to the narrative of money, or even what its economic and political impact may be. The currency’s dollar price may be three-quarters down on its peak, but the underlying technology also provides plenty of intellectual fodder—and is unlikely to go away. So there is plenty to write about if you are serious.
Paul Vigna and Michael Casey, two journalists at the Wall Street Journal, are certainly serious. In their new book, “The Age of Cryptocurrency”, they don’t waste time projecting millenarian political beliefs or searching for bitcoin’s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, though they argue that the crypto-currency’s quasi-religious “creation myth” has been an important factor in creating a community around the project. Before he went offline in 2011 without leaving much of a trail, Mr Nakamoto had cleverly combined ideas developed by others with his main invention: the “blockchain”, a public ledger of all bitcoin transactions. The blockchain lives on the system’s global network and is maintained and protected by “miners”, operators of specialised computers who are rewarded with bitcoin for their efforts.
Rather than begin their book with a breathless account of how bitcoin could change everything, Messrs Vigna and Casey start with a brief account of the centuries-old debate about the nature of money. The “metallist” school sees money as a commodity, a thing with its own inherent value—which governments should leave alone as much as possible. By contrast, “chartalists” view money as a complex system of credit relationships, which allows value to flow within a society. For these people currency is just the token around which the monetary system is arranged. And governments have a role to play in managing this system and thus the economy.
This philosophical division is also present in the debate about bitcoin. Libertarians treat it as a scarce commodity that needs to be “mined” (to create bitcoin and maintain the blockchain, miners solve mathematical puzzles, meaning that bitcoin is willed into existence by burning energy—see article). But for a growing number of geeks and venture capitalists bitcoin is less a currency than a technology that can be used to transfer money and other assets cheaply and securely.
Messrs Vigna and Casey predict that bitcoin’s main calling will indeed be as a disruptive payment system. Before the crypto-currency, societies had to rely on banks and other centralised institutions to keep track of payments and guarantee the financial system. This position as gatekeeper has allowed these institutions to capture much economic rent. The blockchain technology cuts away the middlemen by taking over the role of ledger-keeping. “At its core, crypto-currency is not about the ups and downs of the digital currency market,” the authors write, but “about freeing people from the tyranny of centralised trust.”
The book is at its liveliest when it discusses the potential impact of bitcoin. The currency may not be a must-use in rich countries with well-developed payment services, but it could help the poor world’s 2.5 billion unbanked to connect to the formal financial system (the book opens with the story of an Afghan woman who gets paid in bitcoin for the articles she writes for an American website). What is more, because no one controls the blockchain it has already become the foundation (“platform” in the parlance) for a growing number of start-ups. And the technology may also undermine other centralised institutions in the “trust business”, such as stockmarkets, or give the sharing economy a boost (some have speculated that in future taxis may be not only self-driving, but self-owned—meaning they are effectively owned by the blockchain).
Wisely Messrs Vigna and Casey do not predict that this will happen overnight, or that the technology is a panacea. Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies will continue to grow, they write, not alongside the offline world, but attached to it, with institutions and businesses adopting it to suit their needs. Bitcoin may well trigger a revolution, but it will be a slow one.

Here in the U.K. inflation is measured by the C.P.I. (Consumer Price Index).  A basket of goods and services is measured each year and from that inflation is measured.
Here's where it works for the stupid and ignorant and not those with at least one eye open.
Instead of reflecting the actual inflation figures, they've just made the measure of the goods smaller. For example, 10 years ago, a 100g chocolate bar was taken as one of the prices. Today the chocolate bar is still there, but the price reflects how much a 70g bar is. That is only 70% as much chocolate, yet this is not shown.
Ergo, the official government figures for inflation, and I'm sure many other things, is an out and out lie.  If you're stupid, believe their figures. If you're not, look at them for yourself.

In the U.K. the Google row has kicked up a stink (our Chancellor managed to get the equivalent of 3% corp. tax out of them for the last 6 years, he thought that was a victory, all the while the man in the street pays 20%).
People are slowly waking up to the fact that tax is theft, it is disproportionate and it's a regressive system.
Facebook paid a grand total of £4327 corp tax in 2014, I paid roughly the same on a couple of miners (VAT).

Williams is a member of the Standard &amp; Poor’s Academic Council, a senior advisor at the Brattle Group and is on the board of Appleton Partners, a Boston-based private wealth management firm.[citation needed]
In 2013 Williams predicted that Bitcoin would trade for less than 10 dollars by mid-2014,[22] and provided testimony before the New York State Department of Financial Services hearing on virtual currencies. In fact, bitcoin remained well above 200 dollars throughout 2014.[23] He raised concerns about bitcoin including it being a high-risk virtual commodity, having artificially inflated price, extreme hoarding, hyped demand, high potential for market manipulation, and need for strong regulation.[24][25] On April 2, 2014, Williams provided congressional testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Small Business discussing the 10 major risks associated with bitcoin.[26] The bitcoin community remains critical of his concerns.[27][28] Williams also continues to assert that the virtual currency is in a hyper bubble and will eventually suffer a price collapse

People have been waiting for a dip to $350 or below to buy. After a week of flirting with it the trend seems to have been up, if only slightly.
All those people waiting on the sidelines now have to make a decision - 'do I think it's going to drop to below $350 to buy (might not happen) or pull the trigger now'.
I think we'll see this repeated in the next few weeks if we stay above the $380 range.

 7. With whom are you partnering?
BitGo for Bitcoin wallets and identity services. Fastly for edge caching of ads and our site content. Sonobi for intent-cast ad-matching.
8. How do you use Bitcoin (BTC)?
We’re still developing the system, now entirely in the open source on github.com, but at this point we know we will use BTC only for permissionless payment delivery to user and publisher wallets that we will create using BitGo’s APIs. We hope to keep funds in BTC only in monthly payment buffers, to reduce effects of volatility. We intend to let expert users “bring their own BTC” to self-fund their wallets and auto-micropay for as much of their browsing as they like.

In the case of Bitcoin as I'm sure you know, no, payments are not reversible. 
Nor can they be requested (pulled) by anyone else.
The problem with FIAT banking is it's all pull transactions.  Once the bank has your details they are free to do as they please, be that take OD fee's, late fee's, close/freeze accounts.

When you see Zerohedge post comments full of beanie baby and tulip discussion....
You know we are at the ground level. The ship has been built, the rockets are being tested. Other than a catastrophic failure at the programming level Bitcoin is going nowhere. Everyday, someone, somewhere learns what this crazy game changing shit is and decides, 'yeah, that's got legs, I'll put my X aside into it'.
Newsflash: we are getting close to the point where the people believing will outnumber coins available. When we get to that point, crazy numbers can be obtained. 
Dollar cost average, and instead of worrying about the money you think you've missed out on, look forward and how much your money isn't now losing out to inflation and quantitative easing. Even when Bitcoin price falls, unless you're a day trader your overall wealth is only going one way.

Home Depot Inc. filed an antitrust lawsuit against Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. reigniting claims from a decade ago that merchants pay too much for debit- and credit-card transactions and adding new contentions about the effectiveness of chip-based cards to reduce fraud.
The lawsuit comes several years after Home Depot and hundreds of other retailers opted out of a settlement, then valued at $7.25 billion, in a price-fixing case that addressed many of the same issues.
This time, the do-it-yourself retailer also contends that Visa and MasterCard colluded to prevent the adoption of new chip-based cards that require consumers to enter a personal identification number, or PIN, to authorize a transaction.
“Visa and MasterCard know perfectly well that a signature alone, without the additional step of requiring a PIN, provides virtually no protection against many types of payment card fraud,” Home Depot said in the lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the northern district of Georgia.
The new chip cards being rolled out in the U.S. are embedded with a computer chip. This creates a unique code for each transaction, reducing the chance that criminals can create counterfeit cards.
Chip cards have long been used around the world, where they often require a PIN instead of a signature.
U.S. bank executives have said that they don’t want to burden Americans with a PIN when they are using their credit cards at the checkout line.
The banks collect higher merchant fees for signature-based credit-card transactions than PIN-based ones.
“While chip-and-PIN authentication is proven to be more secure, it is less profitable for Visa, MasterCard, and their member banks and it provides a greater threat to their market dominance,” the lawsuit claimed.
The legal action also contends that Visa and MasterCard, which set the so-called interchange fees collected by banks, are engaged in price-fixing that prevent competition for merchant acceptance. “We had hoped to resolve our claims outside of litigation but those efforts proved to be unsuccessful,” Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes said.
Visa said it is aware of the lawsuit. It is seeking to transfer the case to a federal court in Brooklyn that is handling other “opt-out” cases filed by merchants including Target Corp. and 7-Eleven Inc. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. also opted out of the 2012 merchant settlement, but later settled separately.
MasterCard said the lawsuit wasn’t a surprise given Home Depot opted out of the 2012 settlement. It also said it leaves the decision on how to verify cardholder identity, via PIN or signature, to the merchant and card-issuing financial institution.
“Regardless of how the cardholder’s identity is confirmed, the chip makes data much more secure, rendering it almost useless to create fraudulent cards or transactions,” MasterCard said.
The Home Depot lawsuit comes a month after Wal-Mart sued Visa for the right to choose how customers authorize debit-card purchases. The retailer wants customers to use a PIN, but Visa requires that shoppers can have the choice between a PIN and a signature.

The only hope there is for the 'masses' is that they wake the fuck up and stop being told what to think. 
Once this happens (unfortunately for some it never will) they will begin to question what their options are.
It is then that BTC needs to be ready for them, not the other way round. I think the user end of Bitcoin still needs a bit of a brush up before you can expect people's nans and grandads to be holding/using BTC safely.

Here is my opinion.  I'm neither a savant or Warren Buffett.
The Euro experiment has failed.  Youth unemployment in Greece is over 50%.  Italy's banks have just received another bail out - NOTHING SINCE 2009 HAS CHANGED.  Deutsch Bank and their derivative balance sheet is ridiculous enough to make Gods cry.  There is absolutely no sane person that could look at that and think there isn't a problem about to explode.  
French elections come early in the year, 'populist' parties are on the rise. 
Merkel has ruined not only German through her immigration policies but the rest of Europe through its monetary policies. Talk of 10 years lost growth in Italy and Greece, why are they going to just sit there for those 10 and say 'this is fine'????   
We (the U.K.) have thankfully left the sinking ship, once we trigger article 50 and start getting some favourable trade deals the smart countries will start to ask themselves what the great dream and the one currency is doing for them. 
I would (and relatively am in trading terms) betting my left testicle on the Euro as a currency not being around in 10 years time. 
As for the ETF, if, and that's still a big if ((however Trumps cabinet seem both favourable to Bitcoin and are technologically savvy(most important thing here)) then institutional investors and old ladies who can't even internet can invest, risk free into Bitcoin. 
It will be the biggest moment in Bitcoins (short) history if it is approved, and because we are dealing with an asset that can't be printed at whim or constructed on demand, the higher the demand the higher the price.
More importantly if this were to happen the Morpheus quote comes applicable, and we will soon stop worrying about how many dollars a bitcoin is worth but how many bits our weekly shopping will cost.

Remember as a kid watching a bmx video, where someone like Mirra (R.I.P.) would be pulling bar spins and tailwhips, and you sat open mouthed impressed thinking 'tomorrow, I'm going to jump on my bike and learn how to be that good'.
So tomorrow comes, it's a beautiful day, you take the bike out.  
By the end of the day you're covered in cuts and bruises, you've managed to pull off nothing what you watched on the video and decide that actually, this will take a lot, lot, lot more time, effort, patience and dedication before you even begin to reap rewards than you had first expected.
It's no different looking at the charts thinking that by this time next year you'll be pulling off no handed bar spins.

I actually find it strangely amusing if he returns with a 15min home shot vid: camera opens staring at a wooden chair,Calaber sits down butt naked with a 12 inch carving knife and looks at his nuts.
Beginning with a blood curdling scream, he hacks into his nutsack, blood spouting/pouring everywhere. More screams, the type you never forget, the type you’ll hear in your nightmares.
‘This is for you boys’ he spits out, dribble falling from his mouth, a deranged look in his eye he stands up with one of his balls in his left hand.
Almost passing out from the pain, he picks the camera up and after a brief moment we hear the clicking of a gas stove lighting.
‘$10,000 Bitcoin - fuuucckkkkkkk myyyyyy liffffeeee’.
SPLASH, something hits the boiling hot oil in the pan, Calaber begins to sob like a little girl that’s just been told Santa isn’t real.  Camera shot moves to a pan with a barely recognisable human testicle in it sizzling away.
‘For you - a hand picks up the barely grilled bollock, camera pans to a crying Calaber, he opens his mouth wide and in goes the freshly carved delicacy. POP - he swallows it and passes out.

Working for one of the largest fund management companies in the last 2 years I asked the CEO (infront of about 100 new starters) what he thought of Bitcoin and the blockchain and how it could change future developments.
He laughed at me.
(The head of I.T. actually piped up mumbling something about a fund to do with Bitcoin but this during the bit license consultations so nothing was happening until that had been resolved).
I quit 3 months later.

From their site: 
Asset depository problem: Assets such as financial securities must be able to be dematerialized on a blockchain network so that all stakeholders of an asset type will have direct access to that asset, allowing them to initiate trades and acquire information on an asset without going through layers of intermediaries.
Solution: An ID management system which allows for only the parties with the correct keys have access to the asset.
Benefits: The blockchain removes the need for intermediaries and unnecessary cost overhead.

How many more 'hacks' (read everyone's credit card details being stolen) before people realise this is starting to be a problem.
With Bitcoin payments the money is sent but no details are required, is this not a better system than holding the banking details of hundreds possibly thousands of customers when these big companies clearly cannot keep their data safe.
I made a point over a year ago about the big banks being hacked beyond repair and their hand being forced to a new system.

That’s why we’re working with the financial services industry to create implementations of blockchain where participants in a network are officially trusted or, better word, “permissioned.” Their identities are known and managed, and, therefore, their activities are auditable. Think of it this way: we’re changing some of the genes in blockchain’s DNA to adapt it to the needs of the financial services industry.
Hmm, not sure if....

B) If you believe everything your Gov tells you you're definitely not going to be part of the solution. 
Edit: soz just see this was in relation to the Dollar, so in this case the US is the world.  I'm not 100% sure how you measure it over there but in the U.K. we have the C.P.I. (consumer price index).  A  basket of goods has been measured year on year to see how much more expensive they've got.  So inflation hasn't changed much??? - No it hasn't, because, for example, what was measured to be a 100 gram chocolate bar 10 years ago, is now only a 70 gram bar.  30% haircut on your goods, but 'inflation' is still the same.

A long read but a worthwhile one.
For all that, it looks like a reasonable assumption that the blockchain will change much more than just the global payments business. It will transform non-financial markets as well, becoming a registry for validation of ownership and change of ownership of assets such as land, property, commodities and – current flavour of the month, in one of the most interesting test cases – diamonds. The endgame is for the blockchain – or perhaps more likely for an interlocking series of private, semi-private and public blockchains – to do all that and become the infrastructure for exchanging payments in fiat as well as cryptocurrency for exchange of those assets.'

I mean, even if you have a job, it's just as easy to move up the ladder as it is to get on it right?  Like, just send off a C.V. and boom, more pay, better job, better hours every time right?   
Yeah, it's not a thing, anywhere, anymore.

Where it goes today or tomorrow isn't the question.
The real question is when will Btc be priced in Satoshis. It won't be priced in dollars anymore: why would you do the utmost dis-service to a finite, digital, unforgeable asset and price it in something that is only good for paying taxes in(and it is only that due to it's proof of violence algorithm) and in an end of days scenario fuel for a fire.
How many of those paper dollars exist?? How many will be printed in the next 5/10 years???
Yes I may seem like I have lost the plot but when you look at it, pricing Btc, or anything for that matter in Dollars/Pounds/Euro's is actually a joke. 
They aren't finite, they are pieces of paper, printed at will when neccessary to stimulate a beyond repair system.
If a Picasso masterpiece is worth $100,000,000 today, what does it mean??? Priced in dollars, absolutely nothing.
Tell me it's 5000 Btc, and without a seconds further thought I know that is 1/4200th of the total supply that will ever exist.  
Linking back to the post the other day, knowing exactly that gives that picture a definitive value.
TL;DR : Priced in FIAT = Worthless
 Priced in Btc = Definitive Value.

Tea leaves can be good, has to be earl grey leaves tho for true future reading (also makes the best brew, but not if you intend to dunk any biccies in there).
Unicorn dust also. Throw 3 toadstool caps full onto a shrieking fafflebooch plant, the leaves will either wilt (time to get beary), or erect upwards towards the moon, indicating the next trajectory. 
Don't forget the sacred bones of a ginger tom cat. The bones can only be made sacred by taking them within an hours death of the moggy, after the 'Cat Coat' dance has been done, whereupon the cat has been cut open after death and worn like a furry Mac, chanting 'Meow meow meow, tell me Satoshi' until no blood remains in the carcass. 
Lastly and best, enter a position without any clue whatsoever, then make at least 20 alt accounts so you can go into to proclaim that 'the man', 'the manipulator^T^M', or bull or bear tards currently run the show. Only ever say this once your position is in the red; it is only ever manipulated when you're losing money, which will be 98% of the time.
