Congrats to all the speculators who are getting filthy rich.
My condolences to all the uninformed investors who will buy in at peaks and end up losing everything when this crashes.

Oh. Vigilantism. That’s what we need, for sure.

Replaced with rd -r IIRC, but I haven't used that one in a while.

Exactly what's keeping bitcoin afloat. Stop doing it, and watch the "currency" crash once and for all.
Been holding this land in central Florida for 50 years now. Keep buying more, because each time the value dips, I'm just sure that it will eventually stabilize at a ridiculously high price and I'll be the proud owner of literally trillions of dollars of property.

Enjoy your $0. That is all.

You can divide silver, gold, copper, and platinum into microscopically tiny amounts and ship it worldwide. Electronics manufacturers do it every day.

Even worse, it's no more than a social experiment by "Satoshi Nakamoto" to fill his/their own pockets with actual valuables based on nearly universal hatred for establishment banking.
"Nakamoto" (individual, or, more likely, collective) is a bigger, more successful troll then Trump could ever hope to be.

Just let them go ahead. All the idiots with a few thousand dollars of disposable income will lose it all to the sly rich speculators who bilk them out of all their money and leave them holding 0.0000003 worthless bitcoin in the end. I'm tired of arguing with them.

Except this lottery isn't sponsored by any state, and the people at the root of it will reap all the rewards instead of the people in control of the state/establishment.
Unless those are the same people (probable), then expect the state to strike back and demand their share to distribute into their own pockets.

Thanks for the explanation. Honestly I find the underlying technology more interesting than the coins themselves. As a small business owner, seems wise to understand it before i actually need to.

I mostly agree, but I have to wonder when Satoshi will cash in because I believe time is getting short if that's that goal.

Why? They're just a single way to pay with the currency of your choice. They can even be a layer over cryptos eventually. Just tap your phone to pay the merchant with whatever money you have and they accept, without having to sort through and determine compatibility on your own.

Brace for downvotes!

Based on this information, why is Bitcoin a viable currency for everyday merchants to accept in exchange for tangible goods? The odds of unknowingly accepting counterfeit paper currency given minimal diligence are very low, near zero (1/10000 or 0.01% estimate in circulation, but simple methods can weed out most of those). Can that same level of confidence be found in btc/crypto with the same level of user involvement (e.g. as simple as a swipe with a marker and a quick glance against a light)?

What happens if merchant A only accepts cash and bitcoin, but merchant B only accepts Visa and Litecoin? If I have some amount of funds in all those currencies, I’d rather have one way to use them all. I guess I’m representative of the demographic that values convenience to some extent. 
I think as long as I’m shopping at a chain-type store there will always be a middle man anyway. Walmart won’t be ditching their merchant processor partners anytime soon.

Maybe he just dropped his wallet in the toilet.
