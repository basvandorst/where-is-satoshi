I guess the answer comes from  A sheet with multiple wallets, that I will number and use one by one, always emptying them out comepletey.
Still strange realising that for a little while the whole sum will be hot-wired, untill the not-needed part is moved to next paper wallet...

I verified offline using bitaddress.org that the wallet is good. Thanks for the tip.
The strongcoin transaction.zip however isn't working out.
* When hitting Parse, it also shows the right public key,
* but Balance stays "Unknown" (Could be because the machine is offline, though I'd expect balance info to be in the Blockexplorer-dump).
* I fill Address, Tx amount, and Fee (The latter two with a dot not a comma I suppose)
But after clicking Generate, Transaction remains empty.

Thanks. So that indeed seems to be the most common way to go indeed, with papaerwallets. But how do I know today how much I need from my cold-storage 2 years from now? Chances are I don't need 100% of it.
What would be the common strategy then, if I would need -say- 50% of the funds? Empty it out and put the other half in a different paper wallet? I would then have to do the whole Ubuntu - offline - wallet creation - print - laminate - bring to a friend - thing again... :-S

VERY helpful. Thank you!

 Thanks. I'm beginning to grasp how it works. Say I want 50% out of my wallet, I generate a transaction with 50% to the address that I want it to go to, 49% return back to the wallet, 1% (f.e.) fee.
 was quite clear about it, yet I didn't get it cause I simply imagined it to be as simple as a fiat-wallet: I take 50% out and leave 50% to remain.
I roughly grasp the approach for generating offline transactions. But I'll not go that way. Too complicated, too time consuming and too much risc for mistakes on my -unexperienced- behalf.

Because I thought a paper wallet is as off-line as it can get. (therefor safest) I created it completely offline, laminated it and will put a copy at a friends place.
But one day I may not want to empty it out all in one go. I tought that be a fair requirement. But turns out to be more difficult than I thought.
But do I understand correctly that when I create a transaction offline, then save it to a USB stick and inject it into the Bitcoin network on another computer, My privkey stays 'cold'??


Er, I'm not farmiliar with it. Just for my understanding, those are softwarewallets that you download and install on your desktop right? How will I know that no key logger or other malware is following my actions as I enter the password security info? I feel more comfortable with something completely off-line.
Another motivation to go paper, is the fact that I've had Multibit installations on USB-sticks, but those are now over a year old and I fear one day, when I want to 'withdraw', the software is so outdated I might run into trouble. (I tried to export privkeys from those, but it quickly got way too complicated for somebody like me, who is much less tech experienced than most of you).

As I type, 30 offline generated, paper wallets (bitaddress &gt; Bulk wallet), printed using USB-cable, are being laminated. 1 copy goes to friend. When I need part of funds, I will empty out corresponding wallet completely, putting the remainder of funds into next paper wallet.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but...
* Looking at the terms and conditions of coins.ph, I condlude that the exchange-rate-risk of holding Bitcoin is on the user side. T&amp;C read: "Holding bitcoin is high risk. The price or value of bitcoin can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero".
* With Abra (I read here...) you put 10.- USD in and after a month it will still be 10.- USD. Did I understand that right?
That does make for a more attractive option. Isn't it?
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:25:37
No answer to my proposition.
I will wait for Abra to go live in my country and see for myself.

Thank you for the confirmation. That's exacly what I'monna do!

When I read this thread, do I conclude correctly that I can safely sweep my pre-August BTC-paper-wallet with my updated-Android-Mycelium-app, to get the BTC out and the BCH will remain in the paper wallet?
@_date: 2016-09-16 11:42:51
Does any one have an update or further info on this?
I'd be happy to use it if someone can share insight into what parts are open and which are closed. And how this has been audited.

Limit is now .75
@_date: 2016-05-26 15:50:44
Yes: 0.5BTC. I Paid € 389,-. Took 1 day.
@_date: 2016-05-27 16:20:33
Sorry: 389 was the rate. I paid 194.5

No need to speak to other party. Trust the application. In case of a fiat-BTC Tx, the accountnumber is given to you once the BTC have been put in escrow by the seller. Find out more from the video on

...and for us it is very important to realise that many people are like that.

I tested the whole process of loading a bit of BTC in the wallet for bail, accepting a BTC sales offer, Tx Euros with SEPA, waiting, seeing confirmation, and sending BTC out of the application to my mobile phone. Worked like a charm. Very impressed. All that P2P on TOR.
