Awesome idea
@_date: 2019-07-02 22:07:38
what, if I pay 0.0005 BTC I can mix BTC all my life for free?
@_date: 2019-07-29 16:20:07
The point is not in it's value, but in it's features.
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:47:49
or binance jersey, free deposits and withdrawals in gbp and euro
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:49:20
Buy when you want to wait and sell when you say fuck
@_date: 2019-07-28 08:18:25
I think it could reach $357,000
@_date: 2019-11-08 10:23:37
Smart contracts are not so smart and decentralized, because they require trust from third parties
@_date: 2019-11-21 22:27:24
@_date: 2019-11-03 06:00:15
It didn't have before
@_date: 2019-11-18 21:02:30
Well, never trust the Russians. Nor the Americans. Nor exchanges. So, trust no one and run your own node.
@_date: 2019-11-02 23:06:39
Good experience with Celsius, a little worse with BlockFi due to their high withdrawal fee. DM me for a invite code.
@_date: 2019-11-08 09:59:33
Revolut is a wonderful app, too bad you cannot deposit or withdraw Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-11-04 23:03:29
So you bought 10 btc?
@_date: 2019-11-17 08:35:43
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:25:27
Coinfloor and Binance.je have faster payments
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:07:32
At least they returned the gold, Russia never returned it to Romania in WWI
@_date: 2019-11-17 09:48:06
I don't think countries like Russia or China give a fuck about any Rothschild
@_date: 2019-11-09 21:36:26
If a pretty girl from China talks to me over a month she deserves the $30 I have in my bank account
@_date: 2019-11-15 16:07:06
Now they should ban selling Bitcoin for low prices and all good
@_date: 2019-11-15 15:57:46
We should ask Trump to create more debt to make everyone a millionaire
@_date: 2019-11-08 11:54:57
But why, is she laundering money?
@_date: 2019-11-01 12:27:57
So these are the Chinese heavier bags
@_date: 2019-08-08 05:40:48
You can use it in watch only mode
@_date: 2019-08-09 21:28:09
At first I was also against small blocks, but after some research I changed my mind, just in time to sell my BCH
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:19:02
Only 1 million people can own 20 bitcoin or more
@_date: 2019-08-07 20:21:59
Electrum does this
@_date: 2019-08-26 20:55:55
Good to know comrade, KGB is on their way to you

First crypto bank that offers interest will have me as a costumer
@_date: 2019-08-26 09:57:01
100k - December 2021,
1 million - 2027
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:15:30
but Iphone 8 and X are missing
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:08:51
Facepalm. How many people that invest in Bitcoin used this chart?
@_date: 2019-08-17 16:55:15
What about BlockFi and Celsius?
@_date: 2019-08-26 20:52:54
Which one is cheaper?
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:36:32
Being in the million club would certainly make me sleep better at night
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:05:30
Fuck You too, whales!
@_date: 2019-08-31 08:03:21
But Roger Ver said Blockstream wants to destroy Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:13:26
Very well thought chart, better than banana-radiation chart
@_date: 2019-08-25 22:10:46
I'm Satoshi's brother, so I have at least 100k

Why does the top right one look like the chinese version of Vitalik Buterin?
@_date: 2019-08-25 14:32:43


No, mempool is so empty now that any transaction sent in the last couple hours should have been confirmed by now
@_date: 2019-10-25 21:16:38
I need more screwdrivers
@_date: 2019-10-23 10:21:24
I could buy your apartment for 4 BTC...
@_date: 2019-08-29 21:30:51
2014 is not so long ago, probably empty
@_date: 2019-08-05 10:35:33
It should be 80% according to Pareto principle
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:27:57
FUD, who in their right mind would sell Bitcoin for Chinese banknotes?
@_date: 2019-10-24 10:43:44


Sure buddy
@_date: 2019-10-30 07:04:33
China and Russia probably already own some bitcoin purchased by mining
@_date: 2019-08-18 14:21:35
You're not supposed to withdraw, just deposit
@_date: 2019-10-25 09:54:44
I opened my computer but can't find my coins inside
@_date: 2019-10-28 17:24:39
Is this the partnership with Starbucks and Microsoft? If yes, this can lead to unlimited bitcoin scalability at the cost of centralization. But it might push the price up as the coffee buyers don't need decentralized payments.
@_date: 2019-10-25 21:45:34
Donate fiat to me, and I will move the price for you :D
@_date: 2019-08-26 20:57:56
You need the desktop version
@_date: 2019-10-04 22:47:13
Tell no one about it, sell a little on Coinbase, hold the rest and enjoy your life
@_date: 2019-10-14 13:49:51
We already knew that
@_date: 2019-08-30 14:05:23
Not yet Bizo, wait for me to get in the rocket

Any crypto except Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-29 09:42:35
@_date: 2019-10-29 07:32:15
Well-versed, but didn't know that you can make more money mining monero than bitcoin with a cpu
@_date: 2019-10-08 08:58:44
*7 months
@_date: 2019-10-28 17:41:50
I hope China will use this StableScamCoin to pump Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-16 08:35:28
I like it
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:20:13
If it had a market cap of 270 billion it doesn't mean there were spent 270 billions on it.  You can have 1 billion tokens, sell one for $1000, and that crypto will have a market cap of 1 trillion with only $1000 money in
@_date: 2019-10-27 12:22:57
Yes, western people keep their saved money in the bank, not cash at home. You get protection against thieves and a small interest. USD and GBP existed for hundreds of years.
@_date: 2019-12-15 23:20:55
Just open a 50x short on Bitmex and then dump the coins all at once
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:37:22
a couple days
@_date: 2019-12-19 06:54:35
You can pay any amount with a debit card
@_date: 2019-12-19 08:40:06


This is true


same with bitcoin, you don't own money, you own some numbers that have only the value other people are willing to pay for it
@_date: 2019-12-07 10:17:04
You can already get interest from staking ETH with BlockFi and Celsius, and also Cardano starts staking this month but there was no FOMO
@_date: 2019-12-19 08:20:26
I am not willing to give my card details to any shady website, but I bought $1 items from Aliexpress using my debit card
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:09:55
Because they pay me more bitcoins. Like 6% per year.
@_date: 2019-12-17 00:40:28
So sell now and re-buy at 6200?
@_date: 2019-12-21 13:59:42
This was the month they said: "Diversify in altcoins"
@_date: 2019-12-19 08:31:30
I am not afraid, I can turn off my debit card from an app from my phone
@_date: 2019-12-06 06:33:33
How do you know there are 45 btc?
@_date: 2019-09-14 14:32:26
The world is bigger then USA, all the rest of the central banks are state owned
@_date: 2019-09-23 07:33:55
We are yet to see forklifts loading bitcoin in the bakkt warehouse
@_date: 2019-09-10 22:39:34
You were asking for it. Anyone who could find your email password could steal your BTC. Use 2FA next time.
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:31:30
How do you know if it is because of selling Bitcoin if you don't know which transaction was reversed?
@_date: 2019-09-11 11:51:09
Thanks for reminding me
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:25:55
I heard about bitcoin in the news the day it was launched, but never thought about downloading or buying it
@_date: 2019-09-13 16:00:31
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:59:59
I did sell some btc with my Lloyds bank account, but I won't do it anymore
@_date: 2019-09-15 08:16:09
100% scam
@_date: 2019-09-23 07:21:54


That's very deep
@_date: 2019-09-12 17:08:43
What? So if I trade between BTC and LTC 10 times I have to pay a tax 3 times of my net worth?
@_date: 2019-09-24 14:27:40
Because satoshi's coins are not safe
@_date: 2019-09-13 14:40:35
Bitcoin is the best store of value ever created, money 2.0
@_date: 2019-09-12 12:38:24
Get a fiat loan and buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:54:38
1, you can double spend a transaction before it is confirmed, and 2, chainanalisis companies can link the addresses to an exchange, and then the police to request details regrading that account. 
For example someone deposited money to an exchange (probably) both from the hacker addresses and this address: 1BDN1Qqze8ci5XQ1WxrVr3hVP7CViz8fyH, which we can assume is the same person. And this address also received and sent btc directly from Bitstamp, using the address 3PKYmtwmF3FSSZMTZ4ArzYyHCNQr4JbT2M which is probably a verified account on Bitstamp.

I'm not a financial expert but I think futures can reduce volatility
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:58:03
No, before 2011 public keys were known
@_date: 2019-09-13 18:14:35
It's not a mystery, it was me moving my stash around, why are you everyone stalking me?
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:13:10
And one year later he published Ethereum whitepaper
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:10:35
So you're a future whale
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:15:34
What about that quantum computer simulator?
@_date: 2019-09-14 14:36:05
If USA bans Bitcoin, Russia and China will be happy to use it in place of USD. So the first country to ban Bitcoin is shooting itself in the foot.
@_date: 2019-09-17 15:58:04
Everyday at the time you wrote this post Bitmex does a shitload of transactions which take a few hours to clear, after that even a $0.01 fee can be confirmed

@_date: 2019-09-17 13:30:58
this looks like a 10 yo hacker, he sent your bitcoin to some kind of exchange, and then used the same address to deposit bitcoin from an address connected to bitstamp
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:35:01
This sounds like a nightmare, I would have a nervous breakdown if they took some of my money and closed my account and I didn't know why
@_date: 2019-09-23 22:34:04
So where is Microsoft and Starbucks?
@_date: 2019-09-20 19:05:21
You forgot high descentralisation
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:40:00
yeah, but he could lose the other btc if you were faster than him, and also he can be identified if a proper research is done
@_date: 2019-09-10 22:42:11
When you use the internet in Russia imagine that FSB and CIA can see in real time what you are doing, no device connected to the internet should be considered safe.
@_date: 2019-09-01 19:49:22
New ICO idea, armycoin
@_date: 2019-09-10 22:36:47
Use Google 2FA for any exchange account. Period.
@_date: 2019-05-31 15:54:27
I'm sad for those people
@_date: 2019-05-31 11:16:36
Blockchain anchoring is the only trustless way to prove that something existed at a previous date
@_date: 2019-05-19 11:43:06
To the moon!

If RBF is enabled for this transaction, you can increase the fee
