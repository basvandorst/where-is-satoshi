Ouch that sucks how much did he lose?
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:19:38
Because I assumed this would never ever happen to me. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:24:43
I fully agree with you hence I admit to me being an idiot. I live in South Africa our police don't even know what the internet is :D
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:45:54
No problem man... hope that people learn more about security there are some already good tips in this thread
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:25:49
Nope I didn't ever mention this to my newly made friends.
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:23:01
iirc I think it's a VM hosted by 
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:26:10
I agree but that doesn't discount the fact that storing your secret info on your PC which is accessible via the internet is also a mistake. If anything it thought me to be extra cautious rather be safe than sorry.

I understand what a paper wallet is but I'm a little confused when you say you sign your transactions offline computer and then transfer signed transaction to an online computer where you broadcast it. Please can you ELI5 how to do this?
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:44:18
You can't say this dude. We want Crypto to succeed, we can't say that most people should be robbed because they are naive. We should help and assist other people to not get robbed in order to make Crypto more popular and usable by the masses who do not know about encryption, security best practices etc.
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:50:31
How do you do this, would you suggest creating some sort of powershell script that creates a new VM real quick?
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:58:56
100% this. Because I was arrogant and ignorant, I always thought: "This would never happen to me, only noobs get hacked!". How ironic?
I basically stored bits and pieces of the key to unlock the door to everything 
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:47:09
My VM was not an offline VM it was hosted int the cloud. Username and password was the same as my Evernote with an extra character at at the end of my password.
Seriously... what is with this 1 post every 10 minutes thing? Is it normal? I need to reply ASAP otherwise people are going to think I'm rude!
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:44:06
Man I have no clue what you talking about here.
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:29:27
What is a good standard of entropy to have on a password?
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:51:36
I'm not a dick. Well I can be sometimes... anyhow you are right, I shouldn't have asked for donations. I have removed my link. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:26:21
I don't think it was targeted. My gut feel says that there is a script that runs through compromised Evernote and Dropbox accounts looking for text that might look like a seed. Hacker probably than realised that all the clues are there to get into my VM and probably just checked there to see if he could find the other half. 
 kind of Moron stores their seed electronically.. &lt;---- The worst kind... :/ 
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:53:25
Thanks man, Yup already ordered my hardware wallet. Impatiently waiting delivery.
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:48:06
Yes that is a massive mistake. I will update my post later today, thanks for that. What is your strategy to remember logins of all different sites?
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:39:00
No idea but I googled and see that Evernote was compromised in 2013 but my password was changed since then. I must've used the same password on another account somewhere. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:22:58
I have since, formatted my PC, stored all wallets on paper and have reset my passwords wherever I can remember.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:27:09
Foolishness and carelessness... same thing in the crypto world. They have Mercy on nobody. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:50:27
This is the kind of feedback I'm looking for! Awesome.
1) I fully agree. The fact that they had the credentials were already a massive fail. I used a VM for exactly that, to create an "Isolated" environment, assuming it's safe.
2) Wow I didn't think of this, I don't know the maths behind it but this makes sense to me as if they have 5 out of 10 words it drastically reduces the amount of combinations they have to try to get the other 5
3) I fully understand this, it's just a shot in the dark. I'm not expecting anything out of this. Mainly want to create awareness of how I, an IT/Tech Savvy guy can also make these amateur mistakes. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:20:23
I've already done of all that =)
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:20:00
How do you sign a transaction offline?
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:49:52
I love this comment. I'm thinking about it right now. However, I do not think this will haunt me forever. At the end of the day it's just money. Happiness and Peace of mind is way more important.
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:45:02
I just formatted but I'm so paranoid now. I'm thinking of buying a new PC just for crypto. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:32:57
Ah I'm pretty sure it's a VPS hosted by a German provider. Well that's where my Evernote was accessed from.
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:08:55
Thanks for sharing that example. You have no idea how much less shittier I feel after seeing that.
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:41:35
I honestly think that it was carelessness from my side as I did use the same password for my Evernote on other sites. I have identified sites that contain critical information about me and have updated and created unique passwords for each unique site. I have done an antivirus scan / malware bytes / spy bots everything and nothing was found. I even formatted windows after that to be sure. 
I did not get an evernote email with a strange link, I'm usually very vigilant to phishing attacks.
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:31:48
it's the second or third time I used the address. I made it using Electrum. I agree that this compromise happened a long time ago and attacker was watching the address. It may not even be the "German Guy" / "German IP"
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:37:07
I agree windows is more exploitable but to be fair he had the credentials. He would have the same access on a BSD box
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:13:04
Yup, I can't hold anybody accountable because of the anonymity that bitcoin provides, I have indeed been pwned according to that website.
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:28:07
I know man... I'm most embarrassed. It won't happen there I assure you that!
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:36:35
No my password was insanely complex. Yes it seems like an amateur mistake once again. I now only write down my seeds on a piece of paper and will spawn up a new VM everytime I need to access money. The other option is to also not store all your btc in one wallet but in multiple wallets.
