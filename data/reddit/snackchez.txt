Hella old FUD. Check out r/iota for their post on all the FUD campaigns.
Note: I don't hold any IOTA, i just follow a few cryptos out of interest

You were not forced to get tier 3 verification to get your money back. It said you could forego verification and just get it back instead of having to use their services.

Ah, thanks for the clear up. Sorry about your messy situation.

You can buy any denomination in any amount of bitcoin, i.e. you don't have to buy 1 BTC.

Doesn't Litecoin already have Lighting and has had segwit implemented for a long while now, no?

Dip your toe in the bitcoin water, you don't have to go full retard ;)

Not everyone wants to own digital currencies. For example, there are surely people you could think of that have trading accounts, don't want to bother with the purchasing of crypto / digital currencies, but are intrigued by them and, like ETFs, would want some diversification / exposure to that particular market. Similar to say, do I want to open up my own real estate business to own rental properties or own some shares in an REIT?
Does that not make sense? It's not price manipulation, at least I don't think it is... Maybe you can enlighten me? I'm still learning about all of this.

I don't think I'm nearly as technically knowledgeable as most people on or but what you're suggesting sounds a lot like Litecoin, or am I missing something?

Way faster processing times (near instant) from lightning network. Less fees due to Segwit  (which gives more room in a block by removing an aspect of it).
Nobody has been able to answer me yet, but Litecoin already has Segwit and is currently implementing Lightning... so why isn't LTC taking off?
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:08:33
But you're doing the equivalent thing: you're basically fear mongering without any actual evidence. Speculation works both ways.
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:11:06
What if I told you that there exists a cryptocurrency that has Segwit activated with Lightning already being implemented...

I also think that miners not being able to use ASIC on LTC might be a big throw off due to Scrypt (???). I've read somewhere (and I might be totally wrong) that a lot of value from Bitcoin was derived from the people selling ASIC rigs which started a manufacturing race.
Is this correct? I think I'm missing pieces here.

Why would you want to fuck an ETF? That would be a great option for those who want cryptocurrency exposure but not actually own any BTC or other cryptos.
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:48:15
That's only for leveraged ETFs though (an example of this is JNUG). 
Are you saying someone buys into an ETF with leveraged money? Then I would say, how is that any different than someone trading, for example, on Bitfinex? You can trade on margin there, completely leverage your position whilst trading crypto currencies.
I guess I don't understand how an ETF works then. If say I bought into the ETF with fiat money, how would the fiat price fluctuate vs digital assets? I guess what I'm suggesting is an ETF for more than just bitcoin. I also don't see how "leveraging" here would affect the digital currencies's prices.
But about your last point: I think for people who participate on here, it's "easy" to think that we can just "open an account" and purchase futures contract (to be honest, I don't really understand what that means). But realistically, there are people that don't want to have more than one trading account with their banks. Allowing "common folk" (i.e. those that haven't explored the beginning ideas of toying with digital currencies) to invest with fiat without forcing them to own multiple digital currencies, could bring broader exposure to cryptos. Different crypto ETFs could purchase different proportions and own different kinds of these assets. I see it as an ownership pool that creates a crypto portfolio according to that pool's rules.

I don't quite understand your story: what evidence do you have that clearly shows that your ID verification is being denied due to your bitcoin trading? Are you sure that someone hasn't stolen your identity is committing fraud without your knowledge? Maybe something from your past (I believe with equifax, it can go as far as 7 years) was red flagged.

Dude, your account closure is the problem here... Not your dealings in bitcoin. Good job rallying up the conspiracy theorist nutters on here.
This community is so quick to jump on a bandwagon it's fucking hilarious.
Your credit reports won't necessarily show you've been a victim of identity theft. Sometimes, you have to report it in yourself before it's actually identified.
