I believe its only an issue if those same parties to the futures contracts are deliberately manipulating the bitcoin market in a grander scheme

It might not be a traditional stock but it is still trade-able in a martket place (exchange). 
Insider trading is as simple as a person or group having access to information that is not publicly known, and using that information to profit. The timing of information is critical. 
I'm keeping this objective so i wont get into any conspiracy theores with regard to coinbase and bcash - you can draw those conclusions or not yourself.
Lastly, it doesn't matter if blockchain is unregulated or designed to be decentralised, it is still traded publicly. If this shady stuff keeps happening, it **will** be heavily regulated and there will be people prosecuted just like the stock market.

That’s why you don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose. Over the long run, buying at the ATH means nothing.
I bought the other month at 4800 AUD then it dropped overnight to around 3000 AUD but over the next few weeks it sorted itself out.
Be patient and it will work out. If not, that’s a reflection of the associated risk. 
It’s not a loss unless you sell.

What do people do with their hardware wallets? 
Do they carry them around? Store them in mattress inside a underground bunker? On a key ring?
I ask because I’m wondering about the logistics of transacting when using a hardware wallet. 
I personally hold a small amount so when my ledger arrives I’ll probably just transfer what I had to it and leave it somewhere safe but if I’m at work and don’t have it with me and I want to make a transaction, I can’t?
