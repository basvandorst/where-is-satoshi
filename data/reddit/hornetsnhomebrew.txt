For work I’m stuck with the same guy for a few days at a time. We talk about wife, kids, house, cars. . . eventually we get to hobbies. We have the time and I’ll admit to being pedantic. I know where this conversation is going when it starts with fraud, tulip, etc.

Or ask what intrinsic value various national currencies have. What is the discounted future value of a depreciating asset (assuming some level of inflation)?

My conversations often go like this, and I’ve found it to be reasonably successful. 
“Bitcoin is a scam/fraud/fad/tulip because it has nothing backing it or no intrinsic value.”
Me: “Fair point. What kind of backing are you talking about?”
Most folks at this point see the obvious point about the USD and other national currencies being similar and say something like:
“Well the dollar is backed by the US Government.”
Me: “Yep. So there is a set of rules that we believe in that’s set by the Treasury and the Fed. I don’t know them all but they have to do with what US bills look like, denominations in circulation, inflation targets, reserve ratios, etc.  We the users of USD have faith in those rules and the arbiters of those rules and that faith is what gives the greenback value and usability across society. Cryptocurrency is similar because it is based on an analogous agreement on a set of rules. There are defined legal transactions, cryptography secures identity and a public ledger called a blockchain allows us to agree on who owns what . . . “
As they try to point out the flaws and differences they spend 10-20 minutes learning about crypto currencies.  The best outcome is that they understand the topic, though skepticism takes a long time to melt.

What I’ve discovered is that most people know that national currencies are based on faith and the network effect every bit as much as crypto or any other currency. They just haven’t thought about that fact much. Once they roll that around in their heads for a bit they’ve taken the first step toward comparing currencies and evaluating the one they use.

Reasonable point, but that’s a different definition of intrinsic value than the one used by the poster to whom I was replying.

It seems to me that this pattern occurs in many complex systems that experience a sudden disruptive increase in innovation. Ecological systems experience explosions of diversity followed by extinctions as the most fit dominate.  “The business cycle” can be an example of this, as can political organization. 
So which blockchain protocols will prove successful is the question, not whether the blockchain construct—which enables distributed consensus without trust—will prove useful. At this point it appears likely that the blockchain construct is useful.

Right, but aren't those unspent able transactions?  If you buy a house it would be useful to associate the title with the transaction. Do I have this wrong?  Can a document be associated with a spendable transaction?
@_date: 2014-08-07 01:42:52
So I realize that I spendable bitcoin transactions can be used to prove the existence of anything hashable.  How likely is it that the bitcoin protocol will incorporate a hash field that would allow a transaction to be tied to a specific document or file?  My understanding is that the unspendable approach used by the referenced company is a workaround.

I paid 1.14 BTC to learn not to store currency on exchanges. Fortunately that cost me a smidge of USD. Bargain lesson.

Currently breathing. And hoping, but quietly.

My reaction to this is that I agree with Ellysex, but her argument is a bit inconsistent. If we are a decentralized userbase that makes our own decisions, then social campaigns aren’t attacks, they are cases being made to the users, who then make decisions. 
If this technology enables a new kind of financial democracy, then making a case—whatever my opinion of that case’s merits—to the userbase isn’t an attack, it’s proposal. I hope we deserve a good token because we will get the token we deserve.

Totally agree that if we want a technically solid, distributed trustless currency, we have to earn it by making a case for the technology that works (or we believe will work).  The reason I wrote this, though, is that calling somebody with whom we disagree—even those that are lying for their own gain at the expense of others—attackers means that somebody gets to decide what arguments are valid and what are attacks. That decision requires trust . . . 
Successful endeavors—businesses, governments, non-profits—require Public relations professionals to advocate their position. Perhaps it is time for those of us who believe in bitcoin to do the same.

Arguable whether an ultra-light treatment for “the masses” is good or bad. The implication—likely just for comedic value—that a hardware wallet is the wrong idea is completely backward. 
Here’s a risky software wallet with a catchy name: Toast. 
Here’s a weird thumb drive that might get laundered. 
EXCEPT THAT THIMB DRIVE IS THE RIGHT ANSWER. 
If you’re going to be feather-light on tech to keep most folks tuned in, at least avoid leading people to the wrong choice.

True. Not bashing iOS wallets; I like them. 
But the most secure answer to holding large value in crypto is a HW wallet. If you get 2 minutes to talk, at least avoid disparaging the best answer.
