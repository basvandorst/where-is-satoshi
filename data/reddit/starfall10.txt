You're hodling for the revolution. Don't be a sellout. Ask yourself what is the intrinsic value of the idea of decentralization? Be with us in the revolution or sell.

We are a long way out from seeing Vegeta meme again. ��
@_date: 2019-11-25 06:30:14
We are still freefalling. Wheee!
@_date: 2019-11-10 08:24:10
Upvote for Vegeta meme!
@_date: 2019-11-26 06:37:09
This came out of your ass, you say? If I didn't know, I would think it came from any of the expert predictions out there.
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:03:40
Gamblers gonna gamble. Someone gotta lose so another may gain, right?
@_date: 2019-11-22 10:08:23
It's time to panic! Sell all of it!
@_date: 2019-11-09 08:14:13
Get ready for Vegeta meme again?
@_date: 2019-11-29 10:09:42
So instead of saying Lambo, we should all say Cybertruck now?

People always comment when there's action either upside or downside. Pushing sideway put all of us to sleep. ��

Boomer bucks, lol.
@_date: 2019-11-23 04:09:28
Good shit. Buy that dip!

In tough times like this, we should all turn to the Yoda meme for wisdom. "BTC, I trust. Hodl, I must."
@_date: 2019-11-27 08:51:13
Had me in the first half. Not gonna lie.
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:40:30
This thread is very active today. We often have alot of enthusiasm in the chat when BTC is running. Keep your head up if you're still holding bags from 2 years ago. Things will turn up soon.
@_date: 2019-08-15 02:50:28
We are free falling! Weehh!!!

Why not wait until it goes to 0? Then buy all of it for free.
@_date: 2019-10-28 01:25:21
How much do you have?
@_date: 2019-10-26 07:03:48
Lol. Tell it true, brother.

The sideway is strong today. It looks bearish to me for some reason. Last chance to buy above 8,000. ��
@_date: 2019-10-30 03:14:59
And the kids.
@_date: 2019-10-23 07:24:35
Another sideway day. Buckle up for that 100 to 200 dollars breakout.
@_date: 2019-10-26 09:22:54
Here comes the drop. Buckle up.
@_date: 2019-10-28 02:58:23
Good job. We say no to boating accidents today.
@_date: 2019-12-18 19:55:05
You, sir, have made me chuckled.

Good job. I have less than one bitcoin. But half of my crypto holdings is in altcoins.
@_date: 2019-12-21 05:26:34
It's like a straight line going sideways.
@_date: 2019-12-17 23:12:02
We are going down. Whee!
@_date: 2019-09-27 05:48:36
I lost about the same this past few days. The altcoins are seriously being dumped.
@_date: 2019-09-05 10:58:19
This BTC dominance is squeezing the altcoins dry.

Ethereum was the one that got me into cryptos. I have as much in value of Eth as I do BTC. Been holding for 3 years now.
@_date: 2019-09-08 03:56:56
How long do you think BTC can hold at this 70% dominance? Another week? 1 month? 3 months?
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:05:58
I have some LTC too. Sold most of it awhile back.
