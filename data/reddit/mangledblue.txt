This is like the MasterMind game back in the 80's - you can wiki.......below
BUT HERE..... - this puzzle here....
You don't get any clues... as to if... you are close... or not
It's locking picking without any clicks.
You either HIT IT!!! or you don't....................

When you guys post NEW client/wallets can you list the version number on the site and on the release software label??  
For those of us that did not spend 24/7 watching any one coin, it would be nice to check in and "look" at the site to know if we're up-to-date or not.  
Many thanx - please consider :-)
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:06:19
it is
run it thru a converter :-P

Tisk - Tisk - BTC takes another hit on Privacy
Your DarkCoin awaits you.......
Join the DarkSide.....
P.S. - Dark Wallet does not count :-D
@_date: 2014-08-01 19:19:27
I'm sure some people will beat me up over this but....
.....not trying to be a troll..
DarkCoin is going to solve some of BTC's "issues".
If you don't believe me than check it out your self.
Never hurts to share some good info :-)

This maybe true but all they have to do is start busting people from all walks of life and little by little people will say, "That's not gonna be me.... I'm not going to fucking jail.... etc etc" and reporting will occur.
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:57:27
Something to that effect - from what I could tell
The whole thing is a bloody mess - no pun intented
@_date: 2014-08-02 19:31:12
The Darkcoin Wallet will be released within the next 2-3 weeks if that's what your asking.
@_date: 2014-08-02 03:02:39
this true
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:05:03
Actually - if they get access to your Wallet and/or associate you to any address and start running Address's thru something like this:  then they'll see everything. People seem to forget that the BlockChian is a PUBLIC ledger. There's no place for people to hide in Crypto. As soon as ANY address is connected to anything identifiable, they got you.
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:47:16
Man - that SUX.
Not sure if this will help you or the Police in any way but....  
It's seems to be working ok, still trying it out my self.
Looks like it has a HUGE potential....

I posted this on here once but.... Actually - if they (IRS) get access to your Wallet and/or associate you to any address and start running Address's thru something like this:  then they'll see everything. People seem to forget that the BlockChian is a PUBLIC ledger. There's no place for people to hide in Crypto. As soon as ANY address is connected to anything identifiable, they got you.

WHY wait when DarkCoin is available today?
You sound like more dead promises.........
KEEP WAITING FOLKS !!! ZEROCOIN...... is a Zero Coin
(rim-shot - I'll be here all week....)
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:14:58
you'll see BTC in the wallet
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:09:51
nobody can be sure of anything but....
I do know that there are enough words in that "puzzle" that people might stumble upon "other-peoples-wallets" and then "steal" the  BTC inside - which is criminal of course
*edit for clarity 
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:49:21
you don't have the right one
@_date: 2015-09-26 13:26:12
I guess you wouldn't really understand since you are blinded by the BTC being all shiny and what-not. Did it ever dawn on you that the ones telling you DASH is snake-oil, are actually people that are buying into DASH. Also, keep in mind that, by the time your hear about the pump, you are the pump.
@_date: 2015-09-27 04:18:47
Please TELL me how my Raspberry Pi2b - running in my Living Room - as a DASH MasterNode - mixing and all that good stuff, makes this a centralized system??
I'm really really confused by your train of thought.....
please help me....

By far the BEST interview I've heard yet from ED
@_date: 2015-02-07 15:27:16
I will continue to tell anyone interested in bitcoin to avoid bitcoin - Use Darkcoin...
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:09:13
You don't put your DRK in the VPS - They remain on your local machine :-P  No theft possible :-D
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:59:22
I can't wait to try it - lol
At work right now - EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:35:37
Your not losing your $2k investment - there is no reason to get it back - you still have it :-D
