Another question...how do decentralized companies even make money?
@_date: 2015-07-27 23:27:34
Interesting article and being from San Diego, I do like Airbitz. The challenge is making mainstream users actually care about decentralization. At least in the US. Why would the average mainstream user actually care if their wallet is decentralized? What's the real benefit if you are not a libertarian?

Do we really run the risk of banks doing what they did in Greece here in the US?

This is David Hay. I am not a bitcoin fanatic. I strongly believe in all legit cryptocurrencies and see them as an excellent alternative to our current system. I'm not a democrat or republican, I like to judge each issue on its merits. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:15:57
I don't want to represent all of crypto. I'd like to be one voice offering an alternative to some of the mis information Jamie has spread. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:13:58
I was trying to talk in a broader since about cryptocurrencies but I focused on bitcoin because that's what most people are familiar with.

Hey guys this is David. I would love for Andreas M. Antonopoulos to join me in the debate. He's understanding of crypto is incredible. If Jamie keeps making wild claims about bitcoin I think it's fair I counter them. The offer is real, I will use my own money. I doubt he would accept it but I want to show that I'm serious

Can you elaborate? I'm not being rude, I'd like to educate myself and I don't fully understand your point.

doing anything in Venezuela requires using the black market. The nice thing about the black market is it is a capitalists dream. If there's a possiblity to make money people jump on it. Right now I can exchange 1us dollar for around 6000 Bolivia's. Some clever people figured out they can sell 1us dollar of bitcoins for 4500 and keep the 1500 as profit. They use this money to buy goods and import than through towns that border with Columbia

Without humanitarian aid supplies need to be smuggled in. Money to buy food is quickly spent and the cycle repeats. My family is lucky to have enough money for the basics. What we really need is change. The international community is already trying but without getting into politics it's not that simple.  
Visit your local Venezuelan restaurant, be extra friendly to any Venezuelans you might know and wait for government to allow humanitarian aid then help any way you can. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:54:03
I am not telling anyone how to invest their money. Bitcoin could crash tomorrow and we would loose everything. In my post I explained how difficult it is to get hard currency (US dollars) and this was to solve that problem. 
While I understand your point about the risks of Bitcoin can I just explain that inflation this year is 1800%. if Bitcoin drops to $400 tomorrow and you sold it six months from now it would still be worth more that the bolivars stored in your closet.  
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:40:17
Like I said proof isn't a problem as long as nothing is uniquely idenfiable. I can ask my Dad to take a photo of a big pile of bolivers next to a piece of paper with the name of this sub Reddit on it or I can show you a blurred out version of one of the coinbase wallets we use.

Not really everyone is getting poorer.
If you had construction materials no one would buy them and maybe you would be less poor than someone without them but your life is still getting worse each day.
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:40:32
I live in the the US. My family lives in Venezuela. When i say we I was referring to my family it is because my SO was the one who taught my dad about bitcoins and convinced him to buy them in September 2014. Without it i'm not sure what life would be like for us right now. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:04:33
Thank you. Keep spreading the word and maybe visit your local Venezuelan restaurant (we make the worlds best arepas)
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:19:30
No offense taken. I'm glad we had Bitcoin lifeline.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:56:18
I am trying to explain the situation without giving any details that reveal our identity so I am sorry if that sounds vague. 
Like I explained my Dad ran an air conditioning business, he knows other business owners and there is a constant need to import things using US dollars and also convert any bolivars into anything else that isn't rapidly loosing money. 
It's not like people walk around saying "I want to learn about Bitcoin". It's more like people are saying "we are fucked and getting poorer everyday, what are we going to do?"
My Dad has been friends with our mechanic for a long time. He would rather take US dollars but now that he knows about Bitcoin he would rather hold it than take bolivars.

It's not really a happy story. My family lost almost everything and I am greatful we can afford food. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:44:12
We aren't hiding wealth. There's almost nothing left. We have enough money for food which makes us luckier than most Venezuelans.
Our government is corrupt and to proud to accept humanitarian aid. People are dying of hunger, there is no medicine, schools are shut and there have been protests in the street for the past 50 days straight. I don't need donations or help but in a time where hope is almost lost there is something everyone can do to help.
Educate yourself on what's happening and wait until the embargos on humanitarian aid ends because once the world understands the scope of the problems here we are going to need all the help we can get. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:28:03
The discount on the Bitcoins really depends on who ever you're dealing with. As Bitcoin becomes more common in Venezuela more people will start buying and selling them making the market more competitive and the spread much smaller 
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:19:59
Because it's a free market people and very few
people are tech savvy people do what ever they want with the bitcoins. So for this example let's imagine there is mechanic in Caracas. He has fixed cars all day and now has $2,000,000 bolívares. He is shitting bricks because he knows the purchasing power of that money with evaporate if he doesn't spent it immediately. He is desperate to buy my Bitcoins and I need the Boliviers because it's the only accepted currency at the store and I want to buy food or pay my electric bill.
Now the mechanic can hold currency that isn't deprecating and maybe next month he needs to buy a part for a car that isn't available in Venezuela so he imports it using Bitcoin or converts Bitcoin to usd then buys it
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:40:50
Even in difficult times like these my family is greatful for everything we have. We are doing better than most Venezuelans so I don't think my father would accept your generous offer. 
To be honest what would really improve our situation right now would be a job offer for my father who has experience running and air conditioning business in Costa Rica, Panama or any Spanish speaking country with a good economy.
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:50:39
No i described a desperate economy with a corrupt government in which people are trying to do anything to survive. Imagine your American $100 bill will only be worth $6 next year.

I'm not sure you read my posts but your comment is incorrect. 
My parents bought Bitcoin in September 2014. My SO was the one that introduced them to it because of the dangers and added expenses they had incurred trying to get US dollars. 
I don't send my parents money they invested that money in 2014 and it has paid good returns which they are using to survive. If/when it runs out I will help them how ever
I can.  
I never suggested anyone convert their life savings to Bitcoin. I am telling my story. If my parents had the opportunity to buy US dollars we probably would have never gotten involved with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:44:37
Sorry English is my second language and my SO has been helping write these posts.
Ask me any question that only a Venezuelan would know 
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:22:46
To be 100% honest I'm not sure exactly how they convert it. I use the blockchain app and they give me cash.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:23:26
No 1800% inflation and Bitcoin prices continuing to skyrocket is effecting my use of Bitcoin. I thought Bitcoin was free to use?
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:16:36
If the price of Bitcoin stayed the same it would still be 18x better than holding onto bolivers this year.

I wasn't trying to start a political argument. I was trying to explain the realities of my life right now. 
Our president is trying to illegally re-write our constitution which if successful will change our country into a dictatorship. It's doesn't matter where you stand politically everyone can agree that's wrong. 
My comments about the black market are ultilitarian. Getting food in stores is difficult, getting food on the black market isn't. I'm very polically center so I don't want to argue about this point. 
There is no feel good slogan. My family is seriously fucked and my neighbors are fucked even worse. We have no moral high ground we aren't better than anyone we are just trying to survive.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:19:14
If we had a democracy and the government would follow the constitution we would have a new election and things would change.
But right now the president is busy trying to write and new constitution that will obviously make it impossible for him to loose power. 
We can talk about voting but I don't see how that is relevant if bad actors are busy turning your country into a dictatorship.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:01:10
I don't know. I wouldn't decribe my family as tech savvy. My significant other was the one tought us about Bitcoin and it's the only one we've used.

No we are all very educated (part of the free universities provided during the good times of socialism.) but we have no power. The government  has taken the country's resources to enrich themselves and now they have control over every part of our lives. We crave a democracy but we have no way to achieve it. There are protest every day in the streets for the past 50 days. Protestors throw rocks, government troops shoot back. Over 40 protestors are dead and things are getting worse every day 
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:39:25
You talk about this like you're buying a pizza. When the reality is my family knew things were getting worse in 2014 and were trying to preserve their life savings. 
If people get killed for a cell phone you think it's a good idea to broadcast on WhatsApp hey I have a large amount of money tied to a bank account with my name and address who wants to trade (are you trying to tell me this isn't a logistical problem?)
They did successfully open a bank account in Panama and converted some bolívares into USD. Some of it was done electronically through family and friends on Facebook and whatapp groups and some of it was physically taken out of the country by plane when my father went to Panama to open the account. The flight, accommodation, account keeping fees made this a very costly option. Now compare that to the cost of opening a bitcoin wallet? 
If they had purchased bitcoins in 2013 instead of 2014 their investment for a short period of time might be worse if you compare it to holding US dollars but if you compare it to holding Bolívares it still works out to be a much better investement in every senerio
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:40:28
You know so little about me but you are so fast to lable me a socialist despite the fact that my father ran a business and I am currently living in the United States. All you know is my family lives in Venezuela, you don't know how they voted or who they supported but you are already giving us advice on how to choose a new country to live in. How would you like it if I start posting stupid shit that Donald trump says then make a comment like well your country voted for him so you must agree with him. 
We aren't stupid or uneducated we know what's going on. It's been the crippling economic problems that have caused us to becombe stuck here. Go to the bank today you have enough money to buy 100 packets of corn. Go back one week later and now I can only buy 50 for the same amount. How do you want us to save for a new future when we can barley afford to stay alive?
