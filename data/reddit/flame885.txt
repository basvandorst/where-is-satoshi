Just spotted this whilst browsing around - what happened was we had several transactions go through without details. Unfortunately word got out about this and caused a lot more claims for the cards than there were transactions. It was an absolute nightmare and we ended up out of pocket by a fair amount - live and learn I guess.

Try using the bitcoin tip bot?

Very close to nothing. The GPUs in those machines are likely very underpowered for mining these days - heck even a high end GPU doesn't mine nearly as well as they used to. That said, give it a go and see what happens - but don't be too sad if nothing comes of it.

Occasionally there might be a discount, but the card is more to give you little extras when you buy drinks and every so often they might send you a promotion. It's basically a loyalty card.

Not related to this, though it does sound interesting. All of our cards come from the UK.

I think an insane amount of trades just went through!

Not too sure, Starbuck's site doesn't say either way.

It was only 3 BTC, but those 3 bitcoins would be *really* helpful right now.

If your client is out of sync with the blockchain, then you won't have downloaded the part of the blockchain with your transaction in. Once you've downloaded that block the funds should appear.
As a side note, it could be an internet connection issue you have so it might be worth importing your wallet into an cloud based wallet such as [blockchain.info](

Every time there's an all time high, I spend a few moments of pure hatred towards myself for accidentally wiping my wallet a year ago.

I believe so, logging into my Starbucks account on the US website shows my balance in dollars. I don't see why it shouldn't. If there are any problems, I will more than happily sort something out for you.

Of course, but a loss is a loss nonetheless.

Thanks, might have to give that a try, it was a fair while ago, and I still have the hard disk somewhere :)

Sadly not, I just thought "screw it".
