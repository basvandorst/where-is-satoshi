This is what happens when a currency doesn't inflate. You hoard it. And when you hoard it, it will never be used as a form of currency which it was meant to. I sold at 15k and you folks are riding nothing other than the death coster. Only one lying cunt will say he's here for the tech. Where coin loses 10-20% from second to hours. Good luck.

US have very high taxes which is absurd. ALL that road maintenance and could be done for cheaper. Also we would save a lot if we ffs stop interfereing in other countries. We certainly have lot of problems internally already.
