OP makes a good point and you use the opportunity to make fun of American football? P.S. theres pro american football in Canada and Germany as well. You should be supportive of american football and basketball because if they didnt exist and all of our best athletes grew up playing soccer, the world cup would be so one sided it wouldn't even be fun to watch.

Try Abra. You're going to be paying a hefty fee to buy with a credit card anywhere but if you need to Abra should work. I've never waited more than an hour to be able to transfer bitcoin out.

Yeah sorry guy the "gold has other uses" argument is bullshit. Nearly all of its value is purely speculative and guess what... the manipulation of the supply is the only thing propping up the value. If the supply of gold were as transparent as the supply of bitcoin, it would be worth a LOT less.

Can you explain to me the psychology of someone who lurks and posts on the subreddit of something that they hate? What kind of person has literally nothing better to do than seek out a community they disagree with online and create new reddit accounts to post angry misplaced rants? I honestly just feel sorry for you and hope you can get the help you need in life to do something constructive. Seek therapy.

Replace every instance of the word bitcoin with gold in your first paragraph above and see if that makes you feel as stupid as you sound. Bitcoin and crypto will have many uses, but its store of value and measurable, finite supply, and ease of transfer make it superior to gold which very few people question the value of.

I would love to get some lifestyle tips from someone who can live off of 250 a week in the bay area. Not joking, how are you not living on the streets with that kind of income in one of the most overpriced places to live in the world?

I have been doing roughly every week for several months, but both times we tested the $5800 area I would pull together whatever else I could to buy in at that price. I think DCA is the way to go for sure, but saving a little to time the market has made me feel a little better about passively buying in each week.

Bitcoin atm with someone else's ID if it requires you to be 18. Bad fees though. Or download a wallet and sell stuff on craigslist for crypto. Kinda sketchy, but probably your best bet.

Not that I have a dog in this fight, but wouldn't this technically be bitcoin cash with the green logo and all? Not to mention store of value vs built for spending? Just sayin. 
p.s. my second favorite game of all time next to FF2 for SNES just due to nostalgia.
