Don't trade, just wait until "die or live" if you have BTC in MtGox now. They will not earn any more money/BTC from you =&gt; will die or just go back to cheat again.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:10:22
BUY BUY BUY BTC at other exchanges before MtGox relives.

No, I don't

I don't know why you mentioned BTCD v0.9.0-beta; I am running BTCD v1.0.0.0-g32a928e and staking around 0.6 BTCD daily without any problem.

BS news from Bloomberg. Bloom... is incompetent by this source of information.

Hi man, I'm learning English while mining Bitcoin and checking reddit/bitcoin daily. Vietnamese Customs charge Ant S1 by this way: BTC number * exchange rate * 80% =&gt; they don't know Bitcoin!?

Relax! Hashrate is going down too: 293,848,584 GH/s.
Turn off all miners next 24 hours for our green planet please!

Neither $20 nor $1600.

why while 97% premined

If you don't believe it, just dump, stay away, and may regret later...

No, just pin bitcoin.org is the right site to begin with Bitcoin!
Don't advertise for bcash.

I'm buying BTC until most of you guys admit 'The bear market is over'!

I expect them to copy some more lines for replay protection &amp; don't disguise their SeX2X nodes.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:39:24
It's mostly copy-paste source.

10k is too conservative bro.

If you find some BTC, don't forget to claim Byteball, Bitcore, BitcoinCash, BitGold, B2X...
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:41:38
Imo, you should not dump them now and don't buy this shit dip,just wait until they pump BCH around 0.14 or 0.2 BTC per BCH and dump dump dump. BCH will not die in a day but in a long term with tactics and no supports.

If you have a local bank account, it's easy to buy BTC at that site, a little expensive though.

I successfully sent BTCs with 1 sat/B and it took 6 days!
