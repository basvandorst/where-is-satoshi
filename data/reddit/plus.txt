Few observations wrt search:
Your search algorithm is bogus.  When I search for "Dawn of War", I get things like "Westward® IV: All Aboard", presumably because the word "war" is in "Westward".  When searching for "Deus ex", I get "Agricultural Simulator 2011: Extended Edition", and a billion other results that have "ex" somewhere in their name.
Adding games from search is broken.  When I try to add "Deus Ex: Human Revolution" after searching for "Deus" (not "Deus Ex", because it creates so many incorrect results), I get "No input file specified." I suspect this is because adding games from the search page bungles the URL.  The URL for DX:HR from the search results is as follows:
But the link to add DX:HR by just navigating the list of games until I find it is this:
Which works, so I end up having to modify the add game URL every time I want to add something from search.
One last thing, you don't seem to have different versions of the same game.  For DX:HR, there is the standard edition and the "Augmented edition", which costs $10 more.  However, I see no way to buying the augmented edition.  For comparison, SteamCoin.net allows you to buy the augmented edition (but they have a much worse BTC:USD exchange rate, so I'm using your site).

You can always self sign.  It gives you the encryption, if not the verification.  Users trying to visit the site using ssl with a self-signed cert will get ~~an error~~ a warning, but if you make it optional for people who know what they're doing it probably won't drive off any traffic, and in fact may increase traffic for those who may be unwilling to purchase anything through your site without encryption.
