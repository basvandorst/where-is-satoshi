there is no ban. Only bank regulations for exchanges. Most of them have contingency plans in place already so they should not be effected.

why was the original article wrong?

You can't compare no fee exchanges with other exchanges. It's like comparing apples to oranges.

this is news from last week.
Nothing new
@_date: 2014-04-28 05:05:02
This is just a translation of friday's news. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 03:06:52
PBOC doesn't have to make a public announcement. This has been stated numerous times already.

The fact that volume has been declining at a frightening pace, should be setting off alarm bells everywhere. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 15:49:08
old news. They announced this on the 30th. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:42:49
This is the second notice fxbtc already received a notice earlier this week.

Foolish to buy now with so much uncertainty out of China.

Notices don't mean that the banks have taken action yet.

Duh? did you not read the news that came out on the 25th?
All financial entities are required to make public statements by May 10th saying that they are not allowing virtual currency related transactions to be made by individuals or organizations at their institutions. 
Unfortunately this statement doesn't seem to have any "teeth" because many of those banks are still listed as deposit options for certain exchanges.

I think they created the voucher system to get around the first pay processor ban back in December.

It seems the central bank is hitting cash transactions, recharge codes, and auditing bank accounts of everyone involved in bitcoin. Supposedly they have been investigating for a long time, but the April 15th rally forced them to take harsher actions. 
@_date: 2014-05-28 01:05:35


There's no way in hell exchanges will ever open up their books for a full audit. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 22:17:01
They already have a voucher system set up.

Wall St money wouldn't go into bitcoin directly, it would go into crypto infrastructure. That's where the real money is. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:08:54
They don't have to make an official announcement. They can inform the banking institutions subject to the new policy and have them take action. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:01:03
But banks did close accounts for exchanges.

It isn't a ponzi scheme, but there was definitely some serious astroturfing during the big jump to ~$1000

you should overlay the lifetime price chart over the google trends chart. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:28:21
it has been declining all year.
But this recent decline is due to Chinese uncertainty. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:19:58
