Wow you got more than what you paid for? I need to use circle. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:16:43
Thank you! What I needed

Did you show her ? 
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:07:45
Shhh, don't question it. Just embrace it. 
Actually one theory is there is a holiday in china called Single's Day, where a spike in online shopping occurrs. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 06:27:49
Yes do it. I'll still be buying and spending. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 15:34:36
Okay m'lady 
@_date: 2014-11-10 02:40:51
Or you know, you could just gamble that shit.
@_date: 2014-10-10 15:43:44
Good. Now you can get over this and hop on the next opportunity. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 15:34:51
Sometimes it works. Other times you make choices that haunt you forever. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 15:22:34
You fucking idiot. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:24:48
Your username is stupid.

Chinese new year

Yes, I know that part. But people in here always say it's bad to hold into them in an online wallet. I never really understood paper wallets. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 08:53:38
Ive read in the code for bitcoin, none of the //comments**/ we're written in Japanese and all of them were English.
@_date: 2014-05-05 23:56:43
Wowzers 
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:18:13
Until POS

The real groundbreaking  tech behind both of them is decentralization.  The fact that ethereum is Turing complete and not just stack based like btc means it can apply to anything, not just money. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:41:07
Been here since 2013. Have moved all my btc to eth. I'm a software developer, etheruem is better. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 03:02:11
Agree to disagree my friend. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:52:21
It dropped $200 in a half hour. It's too early to call it stable. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:12:37
It's okay, to feel bad for me. Ether made me a 100,000-aire over night!
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:14:21
I really dont think thatll happen. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 08:42:33
So what? I'll bet him that he steps out of bed with his left foot tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-11-06 19:28:00
It will go higher, no worries. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 03:00:23
Do you watch any sports?
@_date: 2015-11-07 23:21:39
Make an account on cloudbet.com or nitrogen.com and put it on an underdog football team to double it  
@_date: 2015-11-06 19:19:16
Are you new here? 
These kind of highs and lows happen all the time with the huge spikes happening biannually. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 19:27:02
Me too. With all the recent articles about bitcoin and big money behind the new technologies, I don't see it going down from here.
I was lucky. I followed bitcoin before the $1200 ceiling and o wanted to buy but there were too many obstacles back then. It was until the recent $240-$280 is when I started hoarding. 
(Bought some nice shoes when the price skyrocketed to $480 a day ago)

Circle is not okay for security. Paper wallet is the best way for security. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 21:24:45
How do you enable 2fa?
@_date: 2015-11-06 19:55:36
Speculation is not information.
@_date: 2015-11-06 08:32:46
99% of the time it's because China or Russia. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 07:04:06
It takes 3 days. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 22:47:50
You didn't make anything until you sell it. Stop treating bitcoin like a share. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 04:22:55
Pretty much
