coinbase is not a wallet.
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:45:30
We've said this from day one. Sure but from coinbase but never store btc there 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:21:30
What's the cheapest way to get coins off coinbase? I thought I read something yesterday where you could send them somewhere first before your own wallet and the transaction fees would be less
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:53:28
My advice, sign up with gdax.
Then click the deposit BTC button there. Deposit it from your coinbase account (free transfer) . Then withdrawal the BTC from gdax into your trezor. They pay the fee for you
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:19:27
Is this like Reddit silver? ��
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:49:27
I'll buy more
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:07:26
Look that's basically the entire software industry bro
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:49:39
Fucking perfect
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:43:56
What's a good exchange that uses segwit? I'm tired of coinbases fees
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:14:16
Yup this is the ticket! Move the coins to gdax and then from there send them to your own wallet. 0 fees and it was quick too, like only a couple min wait!
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:09:17
I wish I could charge people 100k for start up fees
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:26:07
I sold at 850. I was like there's no way this thing goes to and stays at 1000
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:06:15
You're retarded, but the type of retard we like here and at lol

@_date: 2017-11-13 03:07:32
How do you do this
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:03:29
Can you run your own full node and route transactions through it so you don't have to pay transaction fees? Or do blocks simply fill up now so you must include a transaction fee if you ever want it included in a block?
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:39:04
And paid 5 dollars in transfer fees
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:39:54
Done. The lower the fees the better
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:52:21
It didn't start as a "Bitcoin thing"
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:16:33
Hypothetically, bit coin classic full node
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:54:02
All these forks are gonna kill Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:06:21
