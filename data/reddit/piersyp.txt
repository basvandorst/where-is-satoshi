I don't think you are correct in your statement that 


Adding more validating nodes makes no difference to the cost of performing a 51% attack because they do not increase the hash-power of the network, so in that respect they are not securing the network.
What I was really questioning is how a network with less(70) miners can be as secure as one with more(100) miners (if we assume each miner contributes the same amount of hashing power)

I think the argument still stands as it is built on the premise that 


So the starting point for the argument seems to be that the hashing power in bitcoin is low, so not much hashing power will be required to do a 51% attack. In that situation you don't need some huge conspiracy  between loads of retired miners, you can just use a cloud mining service, in the same way the ETH classic hackers took $1.1 million ETC in January this year.

You say that the network can be just as safe with 70 miners as with 100, isn't it the total hashing power that secures the network?

By my calculations, when the next halving occurs (roughly 3rd May 2020) assuming bitcoin price remains the same, the  antminer s15 will not be profitable any more it will be running at a loss of 311 dollars as opposed to a profit of 495 [current profit]( [projected loss]( In order to be about as profitable, the miners will need access to a new miner one with 80 th/s and a power draw of 2600 watts to be about as profitable as they were before ([new miner profit]( A miner with those specs is very unlikely to come out by then, so I think we could see a lot of miners drop out of mining then. I guess since the reward will have halved, the network would need to halve the hash-rate for miners to receive the same reward, I don't think that will happen but I think we could see about 25% of the hash-rate disappear.
