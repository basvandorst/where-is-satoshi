Eh,the long standing decline of the currency hasn't turned around in quite awhile.

Apologies if this is a dumb question, but I have a small amount of bitcoin on coinbase and recently I noticed I had the exact same amount of "bitcoin cash" now as well.  I read the little blurb about there being a split, but what I want to know is, if I sell my bitcoin, do I also lose my bitcoin cash, or are they two distinct things?

Is this a good time to switch one for the other?

Bought mine back in 2011, but anyone who goes against the narrative must be a newb, right?

It's going down, down, down. Maybe it will spike back up to 20K again, but maybe it won't.  What indicators (other than anecdotal subreddit hype) are there that bitcoin will actually turn around again, and isn't just heading towards irrelevance?

Are we still of the belief that Bitcoin is a good investment? Serious question. Seems to have been losing value for over a year.

Anyone else feel like he had a clear agenda during the election?  He is not longer just trying to reveal the truth, whatever it may be.  He is pushing an agenda.

Trump thinks this will strike the reich balance.

Yes, and who are he members of this illusion NWO? Do they meet in black robes and skull masks underneath the Washington Monument at midnight?

Arbitration is not a good replacement for trials. Arbitrators are often busy and have little time to consider the facts thoroughly. Also, like all people, they can be biased. A jury of your peers is imperfect and yet the fairest way to determine liability yet devised by human beings. I would welcome a perfect system of laws, but so long as language is imperfect and facts differ even subtly from case to case, devising that perfect system will be impossible.

Law is an imperfect science. Unlike math, law can be interpreted and persuasively argued depending on who you represent. Until Watson learns the art of persuasion and interpretation, you will still need lawyers.

What is the current turn around time on purchasing one?Which model did you go for?

[Here](  Apparently Garanti Bank has lost 13% of its share price.

Thanks for laying out my options.  I asked the above poster this also, but do you know of any guides to setting up businesses to accept less common virtual currencies generally?  For instance, I believe the site is supposed to accept virtual currency from an online computer game as well.  Any guides to setting that kind of thing up?  Thanks.
@_date: 2013-06-03 20:10:04
Fair enough.  Just citing the source of the alleged claim, as I had seen it in another thread.  
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:37:36
Yeah, thank you.  Just looking to see if it is possible to get one anywhere at this point.  The answer seems to be "no" and given the waiting for BFL, it doesn't seem worth sinking $1300 in a product that may not ship out for another 6 months, if ever.
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:12:36
So to get started, basically, I would need to buy a BFL ASIC machine (or a place in line to get one), a raspberry pi, and then download and install the MinePeon build?  Or would you download that build and then install it via USB or something else?  
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:17:53
Thank you for getting back to me so quickly. I just discovered BFL today and am trying to figure out if its worth the investment. What kind of computer are you going to run it through? I don't even have much of a desktop to use it with. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:02:25
Did you ever get started in bitcoin mining using a BFL Asic and a raspberry pi?  Has it been worth the investment so far? 
@_date: 2013-05-23 15:54:38
Free is always the best.  Do you know of any sites that allow you to set up your website to receive payment from less common virtual currencies?  For instance, this site is supposed to also accept virtual currency from an online video game.  Any idea how one would go about setting that up?

A lot of people are saying you should just buy BTC if you want to see a return, but the price seems highly inflated right now.  It may continue rising but it's also possible it will burst, right? 
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:15:32
How long until I can get myself a BFL or Avalon ASIC?
