\&gt;&gt; About 1&amp; of all blocks since segwit  activated are not including any witness and are thus candidates for  covert AsicBoost.  Most of the recent non-empty blocks are from  BitcoinRussia, so we should probably investigate whether they are using  AsicBoost.
So, how your investigation is going on?
