He’s a lord of Douchebaggery. You and I have far more in common over a beer than any of his hateful and unfounded rhetoric.

Seriously? Good for them. This guy is a hate mongerering Lord of Douchebaggery. Fuck this guy. 
This is a perfect example of a private business choosing whom they do business with. The hyper lord of hatred and nonsense got the short end of the stick. 
Good for PayPal. And ps. Fuck this guy.

Just bought. Buy that dip and hodl.

I buy and hodl. And hodl. And hodl. But I only own a few hundred bucks worth.

Dude. Just buy. They’re cheap AF. Seriously. Buy. I don’t know what I’m talking about. Buy I just bought as much as I could afford an hour ago.
I’ll buy more when it’s up...and when it’s down. 
I like what bitcoin stands for. But it’s lower now than it’s been in months. 
Get in.

Good to know. Looks like I’ll bag that idea then!

Remember the Folding at home thing that the PlayStation could do? Anything like that maybe?

Saw this and loaded up my Coinbase acct with about $50usd of BTC after years of being devoid of all crypto. 
Feels good to be back.

Good to know. I had read that to mine one needed a way more noisy / powerful machine or well...200 of them. :)
So cloudmining is a no go then?
