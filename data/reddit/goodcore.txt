if they are poor they are not likely to buy stuff from the appstore anyway ..    
or give it away to someone who was just going to walk into an Apple store and buy an iphone, then Apple will lose a sure sale

I would have said, take a video of jailbreaking your iphone, installing Bitcoin apps on it from some other repo, then giving your iphone away to a person in need, a homeless person, a poor kid, something like that - I mean come on, people sold their kidney or something to be able to buy an iphone - why did it have to be destruction?

The problem is that tangible items will be traded. Shipments will get intercepted by customs because the probability is high that prohibited items will be traded. The result is frequent disputes between buyers and sellers. How are third parties going to maintain good trust ratings in that case, disputes will be inevitable and no matter if the unbiased third party decides in favor of the seller or the buyer, the remaining party might give him a bad rating.

Happened to me!

It's not a good thing. I was willingly paying a monthly fee and believed the bank would hold on to my money. Now I have to spend a lot of time and money to make overseas calls, get documents notarized, just because I did not have a transaction on my account for 3 years. They just closed it and the online banking as well, sent the funds (over 10k) to 'unclaimed moneys'. 3 years! This is not forgotten money from 30 years ago, it's just ridiculous.

A virtual machine is only as secure as the host it runs on. 
If your host operating system is compromised then somebody could also log your keys, view your screen when you work in the guest OS.

I cant make encrypted backup copies of my gold and I cant legally make backup copies of my fiat bank notes. I love Bitcoin.

Whatever you do, please think of your family and if something happens to you, think about how they could recover your BTC. 
If you only store encrypted USB keys and you are the only one who knows the passphrase, then your family, your children if you have any, might never get them. 
When you have family, unencrypted paper wallets make sense, stored in a safe at home for example and stored in a way that makes them understand that there is some kind of value attached to it. 
If you only store the encrypted keys, then at least leave your family the passphrase on a piece of paper with some instructions. 
You could include a sealed letter in your will that nobody is allowed to open, and your lawyer should be instructed to give this sealed letter to your family member in case you don't want to risk your family to know that you own a fortune while you are still alive. 
In the secret letter you should have the passphrase and location to the USB / SD cards and instructions. 
Think of it like a modern treasure map.

That is such good news! I might no longer need to mess around with localbitcoins.com where most Australians are mistrusting people who are not in Australia and wish to pay by bank transfer from their Australian account assuming it's fraud. I experienced such hostility on localbitcoins.com.

Runs well, also testing on OS X. Very few bugs. Bought some stuff, paid via bitcoin testnet, worked instantly, very fast. Set up a store, had a sale already. Trying to test the dispute resolution process but still waiting for the escrow mod to look into the test dispute. :)

A sale from a stranger, on Testnet. Right now OpenBazaar is running on Bitcoin testnet.

Install the Mycelium mobile app - Find the local trader option in the app - Find a person who sells Bitcoin for Cash in your area with the help of the app - Meet up with them and buy Bitcoin with cash.

Never liked localbitcoins, I prefer Mycelium wallet on Android, it has the "local trader" "buy/sell" feature where you can set a location and enter your buy or sell offers including description, you can chat with the other party within the app to arrange the meeting. (iOS version doesn't have that feature)
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:00:23
Use Mycelium Buy/Sell (Android only)

Honestly, I'd be happy to be given the chance to buy crypto and get your funds out of there. 
Lots of centralised exchanges or other companies like merchant account providers just keep peoples money, no chance to access it at all without going through lawyers, sometimes not even then the funds can be recovered. 
They probably advise you to buy crypto because of pressure from their banking partners to KYC / AML the hell out of you due to the size of the holdings / transactions.

The hotels.com vouchers are a pain to use. hotels.com have a feature to combine multiple vouchers into one (which is badly needed considering that travel is relatively expensive). However that feature never works! 
Also in order to use the USD hotels.com vouchers you must make sure to have your currency set to USD as well as having US selected as the region and sometimes I had to use a US VPN as well for the option to even use a voucher for payment to show up. 
Without the feature to combine the vouchers, they are of no use for me, and it never works and there is no support, they say you can call some US number to get support but I won't go through that trouble to find a voip provider to call them and and spell out 20 numbers to them to combine. 
If anybody needs hotels.com USD vouchers, I might be selling them for crypto at a discount cause I can't use them, message me.
@_date: 2019-09-19 05:00:42
Yes, they work fine. Everything so far worked well and if there is a problem with a voucher being out of stock bitrefill has great support by email. 
The only thing that's really hard to use are the hotels.com vouchers.

I tried it out recently and it had something like a 0.5 BTC limit, you could not place any trade offers / requests above that, I have not checked back if this limit is removed now.  For a small amount like this, it was not worth the hassle and time to do a fiat / crypto trade. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:43:10
I would assume it's a fallout of alphabay and hansa markets being shut down by the feds. 
bitmixer.io shut down shortly after, now btc-e .. they are following the money and people involved are probably packing up trying to disappear, more or less successfully ...
@_date: 2018-12-05 07:40:32
Agreed, I hope the local trader feature won't get removed!

My itBit account was also accessed, but I had a very strong password that I never used anywhere else plus 2FA .. via Authy app on android. 
On my account limit orders were also cancelled and a market order executed to buy BTC with all fiat funds and then a large BTC withdrawal was attempted. I saw the email logged in cancelled the withdrawal changed my password and notified itBit .. then my account was blocked as well. There is more I observed recently that makes me sure they knew about those problems at least several days before. When I have a proper keyboard I will elaborate on that.
@_date: 2016-07-11 07:42:23
I really doubt that the problem is on our end, I also follow very good security practices. You also did not get a login notification e-mail when your account was accessed, right? 
@_date: 2016-07-11 07:14:07
Same for me, I also suspect that, I use VPNs to access the site, never use open WiFi networks, store my passwords in an encrypted application, have long and randomly generated passwords that I never reuse on other sites / services, I had 2FA active ....
 Here are my observations that make me think itBit knew about the problem happening to other account holders before July 9th 2016: 
All my past BTC withdrawals were done to unique BTC addresses. 
Yet on July 8 a withdrawal was not executed as usual, instead I received an e-mail with the subject "Your Recent Withdrawal Request with itBit" asking me to provide a phone number so that they can call me to confirm my withdrawal. I did not see this e-mail right away so I did not react to it, a few hours later I received an e-mail: "Confirm your itBit withdrawal" where I was asked to reply with the amount and first 5 letters of the BTC address which I did, and the transfer was then executed. I was also asked to provide some BTC address to be whitelisted. These additional confirmations were already unusual, but I did not receive any warning that some security problem might be occurring, that would have been really nice ... 
On Saturday, 09 Jul 2016 20:19 UTC  the attacker attempted the withdrawal from my account (see my other post).  
There was however no login notification e-mail around that time.

So finally I found other people with the same problem. I had tried via twitter without success after the incident happend. 
I assume all of you that are affected and have their accounts blocked right now have funds on the exchange that they would rather get out.    
Any success so far to get your BTC out? 
@_date: 2016-05-25 16:50:56
Yes, the limit was also a reason for me not to trade using Bitsquare, otherwise I would have put in a trade.

It will survive, people will find ways. 
If BTC are even harder to get, shouldn't the value increase even more? 
There is always the option to do cash trades. 
Then the banks will have to ban cash withdrawals?

I don’t want no eggnog, lactose ain’t for me
I don’t need new pants.  Then again…TBD…
Don’t want any gifts this Christmas it’s true
all I want for Christmas is…
I don’t want a Surface tablet, that one’s pretty clear
I don’t want that new book by Martin Bashir
There’s only one this I want, yes it’s true
all I want for Christmas is U…..
…nilateral printing of billions of dollars
a month to be stopped cuz it’s causing my dollar to
rampantly inflate, I tell you it’s killing us
all of this open-ended fiscal stimulus
Risk underpricing and rampant inflation
resulting in capital misallocation
all I want this holiday season
is an end to quantitative easing
Now Santa I know you get this a lot
those children’s letters concernedly fraught
But I’ll tell you what I want and save you some pains
I’ll take the candy–you can keep the Keynes
Presents under the tree, the Fed starting to taper
Because only one of them should be covered in short-term paper
Don’t want nothing else for Christmas it’s true
all I want for Christmas is U….
…uniformity in the mandate of the Fed
or reform the whole thing or start over instead
because I ain’t a pro but I really don’t think that
it’s “Buy CDO’s with some dough from an Inkjet”
The year home run records were obliterated
that was the last time we saw Bonds so inflated
all I want this holiday season
all I want this holiday season
all I want this holiday season
is an end to quantitative easing.﻿

I actually have a laminating machine but did not try to laminate a paper wallet. What design did you use? Can you show some pictures of the finished product? How are they supposed to be opened? Cut open on 3 sides or something?
