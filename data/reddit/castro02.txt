How does that work?  It's a 25th word that I would have to remember to add when recovering the wallet?  
It definitely seems more secure, but I don't want to be in a position where me or my family is screwed if I forget, or if something happens to me.

How so?  I'm finding myself in a very similar position as OP.  I was comfortable losing what I initially invested, but now that I've seen it grow by 4000% it would be pretty tough to stomach losing it all.  Does that mean it's time for me to cash out?
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:38:18
I think that was pretty recent
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:56:23
....and where did you copy it from?
@_date: 2014-12-05 20:24:18
Ya, I believed OP, and thought all the people calling him out were just being dicks, but this conversation is very strange...  Honestly, I'm not sure what OP can do at this point to prove himself, he should probably just let it go.

how confident are you that the person you meant to send it to isn't lying?  It's a bit fishy that the post was deleted, and the person receiving it waited 2 days to tell you that they never received it.

Could you please explain that a bit more?  How could a keylogger compromise my account if I have 2fa turned on?  I was under the impression that the codes are one time use only.  
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:06:47
Seems like a simple fix, they just need a disclaimer stating its for tobacco use only.  Its not their fault if people use it in a different way.

Interesting that Dorian Nakamoto was surrounded by reporters for most of the day, and then this shows up once he's in private...
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:20:16
But he could be stealing all the internet points!  I demand his first born for DNA testing!  
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:42:43
His first verification photo had a picture of the license with his name visible.  
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:33:50
So at the risk of being downvoted, I had to mention this....
It seems a bit odd that Arthur is able to write so well in English (with the exception of the strange sayings) yet Dorian's emails and posts are full of grammatical errors.  I know that Dorian is older, but how would two brothers that both grew up in the US have such a different understanding of the English language?
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:40:57
Well all of the posts and emails we've found of Dorian's look to be pretty poorly written, I'm a little surprised how much better his brother seems to write, even if it is a bit strange

How much would 2fa on an exchange protect me from malware?  I never let it remember my computer, so it always requires the code.  Am I relatively safe from losing my coins due to visiting some sketchy websites?
@_date: 2014-02-21 16:10:01
Care to give a rough figure of how much you've transfered to coinbase?  I've been using my chase account with them for the past couple months too,  but only a couple thousand in 5 transactions.  Are you able to open a new chase account?

With all of the lawsuits from people who lost btc, I doubt they're gonna pay anything back until its all settled.
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:58:49
A couple things: 
2% of the popular vote and nearly 3 million votes is not "slight", and the idea that her lead only came from CA and NY is retarded, and ignores the tens of millions of other people who voted for her.  That's like saying Trump only won the EC because of Texas, it's technically true because without Texas he wouldnt have won, but ignores the rest of the EC votes he got in other states.
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:38:46
The states are in no way equally represented in the electoral college, that's why they all get a different number of EC votes...  You may want to to rethink that argument.
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:53:01
It's based on population, but it's not equal that way either.  A vote in Wyoming is worth 4x the electoral votes that a vote in New York is worth, that doesn't seem very equal to me...
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:39:57
Is that so?  I didn't realize there were any studies or reports done on the issue.  Do you have any source to back up your claims (excluding Trumps tweets) or are you just talking out of your ass?
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:32:50
So please, share this critical thinking with me that led you to your conclusion that Clinton's lead in the popular vote is "solely attributed to California's immigration enforcement and social spending ideology."  Because it sounds like you're talking out of your ass.  
@_date: 2016-12-21 01:19:35
That article says NOTHING about immigration or voting fraud, and doesn't back up a single word you said.  Did you include the wrong link?
Edit: It doesn't even include the words: immigration, social, or spending.  Are you high?
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:57:26
What does that even mean?
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:58:44
It's useless because it neglects the 50+ million other people that voted for Clinton.  
And no, you don't need to mention your bullshit complaints about voters fraud, give it a rest.
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:52:57
That's an incredibly useless statistic.  Ya, If we take out a huge chunk of Clinton voters, Trump would have won the popular vote.  No fucking shit...  
But let's play your game, if we remove one state with a population of 40 million people who voted for Clinton, what would the numbers look like if we removed the equivalent number of voters from trumps states with the biggest margins?
