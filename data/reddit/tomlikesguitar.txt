I've used the same advice as I do for gambling with investing in crypto.
1. Go in with as much money as you are okay with losing.
2. Pick an amount of money that you would be happy with winning.
3. Play until you either lose everything OR hit the high number and cash out.
4. Pocket the original amount of money you invested.
5. Figure out if you want to go back in or if you're happy with what you've gotten so far.
Anyone trying to make a living off of this is as dumb to me as someone who is trying to make a living in a casino. You could know every line of the Bitcoin source code and it wouldn't make you any more capable of predicting the future of a FOMO gamble like this.
Sure SOME people might be exceptions to the rule, but that's just life. SOME people will win the lottery, SOME people will become famous musicians, SOME people will make millions of dollars a year from YouTube videos...
Always assume you are not one of those people.

Yep. This is a high risk investment. Anyone with more than 5% of their investment portfolio in high risks has a lot to learn about finance.

Two words you should never say about large investments.

This whole sub is so cringy.

And at the end of it you realize you just threw away real world money for something stupid.

Every time I think of making an app, my first thought is how I should make a bunch of fake reddit accounts first to help publicize it. I mean, companies do this shit all the time.
Never EVER believe anyone plugging anything ever on reddit.
Lesson learned people.

No. I implied that "just hodl" is bad investment advice.
If you want real investing advice outside of a meme, then talk to your financial advisor or at the very least form your opinions from financial discussion forums instead of reddit.
Anyone who says the word "hodl" non-sarcastically is a fucking idiot.

Enjoy your investment buddy. I wish you luck.

Very true. Volatile investments should be less than 10% of your portfolio. I just get the feeling there's a lot of people here who don't know that.
And people who bought in at 1000 should get their money the fuck out of Bitcoin and into a real currency lol.

How can you say that you have 95% of your portfolio in a single investment and not realize how dumb that is?
You are straight up fucking your future.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:52:33
That's insane logic. Even a safe investment can be gone **TOMORROW**. Fucking blue chip stocks have a small chance of failure.
Are you people really learning how to invest from fucking reddit memes or are you just fucking with me right now?
Keeping 95% of your total portfolio in one volatile investment is about as dumb as just bringing all that money to a fucking blackjack table.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:04:20
No. No I actually didn't say that at all...
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:19:57
Everyone here you mean?
Yeah, my point exactly.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:30:57
It's amazing to me that kids will be bankrupt in a few years because they prefer meme investment advice over *actual* investment advice lol.
