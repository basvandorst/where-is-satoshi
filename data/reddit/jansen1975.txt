It is great to hear you are interested in supporting our friends at the SENS Research Foundation, such a generous thing to do at an ideal time of year too. Thank you so much for helping them out. I honestly could not think of a greater gift to give someone than their health, because health is the greatest wealth of all I believe, and it seems you agree :)
I am Steve Hill from the US charity LEAF ( and we support the work of SENS and other researchers of aging through news, advocacy, outreach, education, and crowdfunding for research. The SRF is a brilliant cause to support and Happy Holidays to you! 
And it was nice of to mention us alongside SENS.

Hi there, I have contacted Dr. de Grey to see if he can come and speak to you here. There have certainly been some tangible results in recent years including publications in peer-reviewed journals, but I think Dr. de Grey should go into that rather than I.
There is also a summary + interview of SENS progress from when we caught up with Aubrey earlier this year made by the US non-profit LEAF which I work for.

Wanting to cure age-related diseases is far from pointless or selfish. If you think wanting to end cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, heart disease, COPD and other hideous diseases is selfish you need to think again. 
What is selfish is suggesting curing diseases is pointless and your mistaken belief that the longer someone lives the less right they have to remain alive is sick. 
Imagine the medical world if doctors felt as you do. There would be no surgeries, no attempts to cure diseases or healthcare. Fortunately, the majority of the world happens to think curing diseases is a good thing. 
Go visit your local geriatrics ward sometime and you look at those people and you see how much humility you feel looking at them and knowing science could probably stop this. GTFO you should be ashamed of yourself.

I second this, one bitcoin would have a huge impact on the early stage research being conducted by the SENS Research Foundation. It would go a long way to help keep the lab supplied with reagents, pipettes and all kinds of bits and pieces needed to conduct medical research. I cannot think of a better cause than ending age-related diseases for good.

As a science writer from LEAF, I support the SENS Research Foundation nomination for the important research work they are doing.
