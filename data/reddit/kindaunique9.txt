With “a lot of savings” I mean a big chunk of savings. As I don’t consider myself to have “lots and lots of savings” I put a big percentage of the savings I have into bitcoin. Which indeed could be less than your 20%.
@_date: 2019-11-05 09:11:12
What makes you think that?
If the price would ever do that, I would just buy more - and so would others I can imagine - which would drive the price up again. 
And at some point, with the hundreds I bought at 1.60 I would recover any loss when btc increases in value again.

And ride it to the moon
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:47:08
Between 20/25k

That is awesome!
@_date: 2019-11-22 18:29:09
Nice discount
@_date: 2019-11-05 09:13:04
Sure thing, thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2019-11-06 16:01:57
Damn sorry just saw that. I don‘t use any exchange... got a wallet and bought via atm/friends. 
I think I will get a trezor or something like that and will put into cold storage. I don‘t really trust exchanges enough to diversify there (I heard to many bad things and not enough good things about them). 
I like to keep it simple. I will use cold storage for hodling and one wallet for purchases - that will be it.

I don’t think of myself as a genius, no. What makes you think that I did that? 
That’s what I plan on doing. Just hold it.
@_date: 2019-11-11 01:22:39
Hahaha what a fucking legend ����
@_date: 2019-11-04 13:30:47
Awesome, 3600 sounds like a good starting point  to me ����
@_date: 2019-11-04 11:20:26
With a lot of savings I mean a large chunk of all your savings. Let’s say above 75%
@_date: 2019-11-24 02:19:41
Ooh really did he do that?
@_date: 2019-11-04 13:47:38
In that case I misinterpreted your question and adjusted the circumstances I have to the country I live in. 
In your case, I am.
@_date: 2019-11-09 08:22:57
Where did you get them? Had a similar thing happening to me when I bought from an atm (and scanned the public - instead of the private key)
@_date: 2019-11-22 00:05:35
Something like that happened to a friend of mine. The fucking bank FROZE ALL OF HIS ACCOUNTS and he had to go to the bank and sign some fucking form. The next day he was leaving to Thailand and he was lucky as fuck they froze it before he got there otherwise he could not have accessed any money what so ever.
@_date: 2019-11-05 09:07:00
Haha okay I’ll see :P
@_date: 2019-11-23 15:03:16
Yes ����
@_date: 2019-11-30 10:36:28
How much did you go for?
@_date: 2019-11-10 00:55:14
Same here ����
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:48:36
Between 20 and 25k 
Not too much of a burden. Could pay back a big amount of it with money I get owed by a friend.
Other than that it would be about 250 bucks a month (over 10 years).
@_date: 2019-11-05 09:01:05
Nope. Why do you mean I couldn’t sell without taking a loss? I could sell now and make some profit. Have a pleasant day ��
@_date: 2019-11-05 09:06:10
Yes sir
@_date: 2019-11-04 02:46:55
Almost in the same position. I‘m 23 years old, done with school, working part time and starting a business on the side. 
(Almost) all my money is in btc. I have a safety net of 2k and a little bit to get christmas presents but other than that - I put all my money into bitcoin.
Ooh and... nobody knows that I put my savings into btc a month ago. Think my parents also would think I‘m a retard
@_date: 2019-11-05 09:12:23
Above 80% of my savings.
@_date: 2019-11-21 22:33:23
Looking forward to the switch... where there‘s gonna be a higher high every week
@_date: 2019-11-06 09:51:58
I was at a pretty similar point a couple of weeks ago. I will put in more money (now I have slightly under 10k in btc) first a lump sum of about 5k and dca every month after that - as much as I can. I ensure however that I have a safety net - always - and will hodl my btc for at least until the halving 2020. 
After that if some good gains are there I take out some of my btc and I will make sure that I hodl at least 1 - 1.5 btc for the next 6-10 years.
By the way, the questions I asked myself were: 
What would I regret more...
If I would not go in and the price would go up by a lot and I don‘t have any btc what so ever?
I now put in my chunk of money and I get slapped in the face for the next couple of weeks because the price drops drastically.
My conclusion:
I put in a chunk of my savings NOW, if the price shoots up, happy me.
If the price goes down, I‘ll simply buy some more.
@_date: 2019-11-11 08:21:23
Just bought some more btc
@_date: 2019-11-23 15:03:00
Sure thing man
@_date: 2019-11-04 12:18:31
Lol fuck no I’m not rich. I get money - I don’t spend too much of it - something is left over in my bank account and it sits there - that kind of savings. 
How do you mean “we have a lot of loans” who’s “we”?
@_date: 2019-11-23 14:47:22
And congratulations ����
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:32:18
Just to confirm, the next halvening is happening around may 2020 right?
@_date: 2019-10-09 14:09:54
What do you suggest?:)
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:12:42
I would sell half also
@_date: 2019-10-09 14:12:04
Thank you
@_date: 2019-10-11 17:08:37
Hey there! My in rabbit piss covered mushroom head could walk to an atm right now and cash out 5k. 
From btc to the converted currency I use.
Sounds great doesn’t it?
Probably, my head - if it really was covered in piss - would still smell better than that attitude of yours.
@_date: 2019-10-16 20:57:03
That the bitcoin price rises so high that - with the coins I then have - can do what ever I want.
@_date: 2019-10-16 10:39:21
ATM *if you don’t care too much about the fees. In Switzerland they are about 5%
@_date: 2019-10-09 13:58:01
Nice thank you for your answer :)!
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:45:20
Just drop some more and I‘ll buy some more
@_date: 2019-12-30 13:41:15
She told me she did it before but on other Atms (with other people who helped her) and has no clue how this one works.
Now the background picture on her phone was her daughter - it appeard to be the same woman in the whatsapp profile picture she had the address from - so I assumed it was for her daughter... 
That being said I am not 100% sure and I should have asked. To be honest a scam was not the first thing that came to my mind. 
It for sure will next time.
@_date: 2019-12-02 22:01:08
I agree
@_date: 2019-12-02 21:30:58
Looks like a scam already
@_date: 2019-12-11 07:54:11
That is freaking amazing. Love it. Are you currently selling art of yours?
@_date: 2019-12-17 10:31:53
Something awesome happened Today
