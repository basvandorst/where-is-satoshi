People were skeptical of stability at $10, $100 and $1000 not even a year ago. The price has to level off at some point but there isn't much reason to believe that $1000 is the end all. Very few people even know about bitcoin and if the user base doubles or triples this year then why is $10,000 unreasonable? It would "only" be a 10x increase in value, which sounds ridiculous now but again it is fairly small change compared to this past year.

Do you provide money allocation and usage stats anywhere? I don't see them on your webpage but I'd be interested in looking at the numbers.
  1,000BTC would go a long ways for an operation as small as yours but it is also such a large sum that it raises some eyebrows. Many charities don't use even a small fraction of their money for charitable purposes and instead redirect it to high salaries for their full time staff.  You have five full time staff members and I've never heard anything bad about your operation. 
However, it'd be great if you could provide a simple infographic to chart out your expenses in order to help alleviate fears that this sum might not actually go to help the homeless. Maybe even make a public pledge that all 1,000BTC from the run will go to food and shelter and none of it will be used to pay workers?  Now I've followed r/BTC long enough to think that you are probably one of the least corruptible people in charity work but being a little more transparent could help get some people on board with larger donations.

From what I gather, ripple could have been a game changer but the creators got a little too egotistic and a little too greedy. They didn't open source from the get go because they thought they were smart enough to do it on their own. They had tons of problems and open sourced to get some help. By the time they got most of their stuff straightened out,  ten or so ripple employees owned &gt;95% of the coins. The ripple company got rich people to invest in them on the hope that ripple would be worth a great deal more in the future. The holdings are consolidated which gives way too much power to way too few individuals. It looks like a coin developed for the 1% and because that is exactly what it is. It is an attempt by rich people to circumvent the grass roots nature of crypto coins and buy their way into the top spot as they can with most industries. The ideas behind ripple aren't horrible but the this incarnation is  almost certainly not good for this movement.

The ads are great but with all do respect you're missing the point unless you plan on making the promo permanent. If you list the cost to use credit card and the cost to use bitcoin on the checkout screen then people would see that they'd save money by using the later. 
For example: 






This way you pass the savings on to the customers which may entice more customers to use bitcoin. You could also do it the other way and charge a bitcoin fee to help mitigate risky price swings, provided you don't exchange it for fiat right away. 
The second option would deter me from shopping at your store but I know it is a rational decision to make if you plan to keep the bitcoin on hand.

You need to consider the fact that large and small holders alike are all very early investors in this technology.  The coin blew up so fast that the margin between large and small investors could have been just a matter of days or weeks. As for long term miners, they wouldn't have used that much electricity mining thousands unless they believed in the coin on some level. 
There is an expression that goes along the lines of "buying a bitcoin is like buying a share of email or the internet."  Many users, even those who own  just a small fraction of bitcoin, want it to go mainstream. Many of them have invested some fiat in it and some mined. The money valuation aspect is nice but BTC is more than just an investment vehicle to the investors. Now the people you are interested in are those who either had the money to recently buy thousands or those who mined a ton or just got in early. Apart from the twins, people with really deep pockets really only just started getting interested didn't they? Most of your type bought in long after most of us saw huge gains and you're perplexed at how all those random nerds and geeks got rich on what looked like a horrible penny stock.  The fact of the matter is that most of these whales did not come from old money, so you might not like what you hear from them. 
On that point, why is established wealth like you curious about the investment ideas of the nouveau riche?   Sure, we took huge risks and got huge rewards from an investment standpoint but we aren't savants. We just put some money towards an idea we support. Small and large holders alike  want their investment to grow more than the 10, 100 or 1000 times they've already seen in the past couple years but there is more to BTC than that. Most of the  holders think that BTC will easily reach new record highs, not because of people like you but because of people like them.
 To poor people BTC represents a level of financial freedom that we can't have with fiat and the banking system. It is the technology and the idea of BTC that captured most adopters' imaginations. It wasn't until very recently that getting rich quickly entered anyone's mind. The rapid growth in price was a surprise but it was also confirmation that the ideas worked, that BTC could become a global digital currency and  act as both a store of wealth and a payment system. The most important notion is that BTC gives people absolute control over their money, they are their own bank.  
You sir want to make a buck off BTC, which is fine as most of us want that as well, but you are looking in the wrong place to see justification for investing.  The critical mass  you speak of will come from average and poor people, the same people that these whales were just a few months ago.  These whales aren't market gurus, they got in early because they believed in the tech. So yes they might be more knowledgeable than most people but they're not that important overall because they're only slightly newer adopters than the guy who bought his first coin this weekend.  There is another saying that goes around here which purports that in the future most people will never even own or see a whole bitcoin, that the divisibility feature will start kicking in and 1BTC will be so valuable that we regularly will deal in umBTC. You really should be seeking out people who are buying 0.01 BTC here and there, people who know they probably won't get rich but are investing because they see the value of the system. These people want to be a part of  the BTC economy when it comes to fruition and they will be the ones who bring about the critical mass, so go ask them why they are interested. 
Sorry I've been up for what's seems like days. International travel, jet lag, night shift, nye and this rant. Good luck with getting rich off BTC, we all see institutional cash as an inevitability so I can't fault you too much. I think you will save yourself some confusion  and make it easier to convince your superiors if you learn why it is worth investing in beyond the price.

There are only fees if they want to use a payment processor. Just as stores can deal with cash on their own they too can deal with bitcoin on their own and avoid any and all middle men.  For example overstock was going to take six months to develop their own proprietary system but then they saw coinbase as a reliable middleman and knew they could start accepting BTC earlier if they teamed up. I think overstock still has plans to make an in house system which would reduce their fees to zero once it is enabled, only costing them money on an exchange fee if they wanted to obtain fiat.

It's a comprehensive system unfortunately. People who have iPhones tend to have iPads or iPods as well. All of that shit syncs and if they have macs then it gets even worse because things become really really convenient for the user. After a year or two the simple hassle of having to re-download apps could stop folks from wanting to jump to another OS.  It's called the walled garden for a reason, once people get in they tend to like it even if they're limited in what they can do. 
The user base is the point though, it'd be very good for BTC if iPhone and iPad owners could use it easily. I know there was a coinbase app at one point but I think it got pulled after a month or two.  I mean just the merchant capabilities alone would be great as many small shops now have iPad registers. If those shops only needed to download a BTC merchant app then we'd easily break into new markets.

Coinbase is never closed, they're a website. If they get shut down then your money will be safe because you won't be keeping it on their servers for more than a few hours. You will buy coins on coinbase and then almost immediately transfer them to a personal wallet. 
Look at the sidebar of this sub reddit to learn how to set up and secure a wallet. Make multiple back ups of this wallet.  Read about cold storage. Paper wallets might be a little too advanced for you but eventually you might want to consider making a bunch of them in 1-2BTC amounts. You'll want to put most of your coins in an offline savings/cold storage wallet. Make backups and more back ups and make them encrypted and password protected, put them on flash drives and hard drives and ad cards and whatever.  Take some of your savings back ups and put them in a safe deposit box or a home safe. Give a few encrypted ones flash drives to a trusted cousin or parent for safe keeping. You are becoming your own bank so you have to do everything you can to protect your money. As long as your wallet is secure then your money is safe. Try not to keep all of your money in one wallet. 
Look up the app armory, they are very user friendly and can vastly simplify this for you.  When you're testing it all out, send just fractions of a coin at a time until you are confident in the system. One important note about paper wallets is that the entire balance is used no matter how much you spend. You don't get change. If you have 1.5 BTC in a paper wallet and send 1 BTC to someone else then the remaining 0.5BTC is spent supporting the miners.  So don't use those unless you educate yourself on it. They are very secure and very convenient but also a little challenging to learn how to create and use properly. 
If you need BTC faster than coinbase then look up local BTC. Use escrow and well rated sellers. You could easily pick up most of your coins there but you'll probably pay a slight premium for it.

People are giving away whole BTC to their loved ones or buying restaurants tablets just because they want to buy more pizza there. They usually wouldn't give that much away just willy nilly but they are doing it now. The reason is because they invested low and they have extra to spend. If an investment pays off well enough then you certainly can cash out some of it to buy nice things, that's the  point. Some people turned $1000 into $10000 even if they cash out that $1000 initial investment to buy gifts, they have $9000 in profit...well about half that now. The point is that many people have still made a lot of money and cashing out isn't a sign they are desperate.  Most can cash out tens of BTC right this moment and stills realize several times profit from just a few months ago.

Game emulators and such get put up and pulled all the time but those who buy them are always able to use the,.

You're only partially right. Most people who invested in bitcoin did so when it was fairly cheap. So they turned $50 into about $1000. They might not spend all $1000 on beer but I wouldn't put it past them to go out and buy a few drinks now and then.  If BTC went to $100,000 the same argument would hold as most of the coin would be in storage and unspent simply because most purchases only require small fractions of it.

It is easy money because every department involved gets to keep a cut.

My approach is to offer to sell it at a discount. People may value it more if it isn't entirely a gift. For example if the price is $1000 then I'll sell one for $800 or $900 to a good friend. For my closest friends maybe, $750 for their first coin.  If they can't buy a full one then I'll offer a similar percent discount on half of a coin. Those who are genuinely interested will take up the offer because it is somewhat free money but not quite enough to bother cashing out right away. Those who aren't, will just laugh and say something about funny money or Ponzi schemes or whatever and I won't bring up the topic of BTC to them again. It is funny though that those who have rejected my offers will often bring up BTC on their own. They're fascinated by it but try to dismiss its worth as much as possible. They kind of remind me of those super homophobic republican senators who everyone suspects are closeted self hating gays. They are obsessed with tarnishing something they irrationally dislike and fear and yet you can see they really really kind of want to be involved.

This really surprises me about the economist, as they generally get knowledgeable experts to write their articles.  Some of the more savvy members here should write a professional article just to set things straight and see if the economist will run it. If even just one gets published it could be a huge win for the community. I'm hoping this is just a case of some finance expert being asked to write an article and not understanding that digital currency isn't just a currency. I tried to explain it to a befuddled coworker the  other day, that in some ways these coins have more in common with email, torrents and Facebook than they do to gold, dollars or stocks. 
 This is a technology and a currency so it doesn't behave like most experts would expect because they're not experts in this field. It's like the chair of my physics department once said, "we can all have PhDs in physics and still not truly comprehend what our peers are working on."  It has to do with focus and specialization. Economists and businessmen haven't been trained to study this sort of beast, no one has, so their words should be taken with a grain of salt. In all honestly, I read fear in many of these articles, the sort of fear my gramma got when it was time to upgrade her computer. A fear of change and an almost irrational hesitation to accept that the world has moved on and might leave one behind if action isn't taken  to catch up.

This link will have more than you'll want to know and it will explain it better than I can. I had a WOT but I figured it was best just to let you get all of the information. 
The short of it is that it has faster confirmation times and more security because of it. This indirectly stems from a use of scrypt and sha-256d hash implementation instead of just relying on the later as BTC does. The main reason is that this configuration allows the network to update changes  and increase mining difficulty very quickly. Also that algorithm  was designed to make use of ASICs very difficult (~10x less productive than BTC). The memory intensive position of LTC also means that it is more difficult and expensive to create ASICs in the first place. I think the idea is that no one will be able to get a strangle hold on mining if they just buy a bunch of ASICs as they could on BTC.  At any time someone could go out and buy a good graphics card and join the mining pools whereas in BTC there is a sort of ASIC arms race.
The last thing people often say is that it is silver to bitcoins gold. I think it is silly but then again with faster confirmation times it makes some sense. If I owned a shop I would be much happier knowing my customer's money was accounted for sooner rather than later. Also the total amount of LTC is going to be 4x that of BTC so it should have a lower price and more liquidity. Proponents of this gold-silver idea say that BTC will be what you have your savings in and LTC is what you'll use.  Since both can be spent in fractions, I don't know if this holds much weight.

You'd receive confirmation of funds in your account within minutes of sale. No one could issue a charge back. It's like semi-instant international cash.

By the time you get your money out of gox, you'll miss out on the rebuy in prices. But then again gox might always be higher than the rest of the exchanges  and you could buy from coinbase which does an averaged price and just sell once more. You could probably net a good 10-20% every couple weeks or month depending on how long gox takes to give you your money. The real problem is your bank account, if you're in America then they might freeze you for questionable transfers and then you're SOL.  Also you have to make sure you're saving enough to cover your income tax because you have to pay that or the IRS will go after you.

Register with coinbase. Verify your account. I think they have a buy limit of 20-50BTC a day. Email their customer support and say you are planning a large purchase on your account. Call your bank and say that you will be making a few large purchases totaling around $70,000 over the next few days. Then go ahead and let it rip.  Most of us think the price will be well above $1000 come next year so just buy in where and when you can and don't worry about the day to day fluctuations.

Actually not a bad idea. I have friends and family in Europe and Asia. I'm sure none of them would mind holding onto an encrypted flash drive for me. Just hope they wouldn't reformat it to store photos or something. Maybe I should look into a safe deposit box.

I think so. The currency has only been around for a few years and it stands to stick around for many more if the community has anything to say about it.  I mean if it lasts 50+ years then getting in on the first decade isn't horrible? Not as great as year one but still not bad. You could also go for litecoin which has been around even less time. At ~$4.00 LTC still has a fairly low point of entry. I mention LTC and not the other alt coins because it is the most well known and adopted. LTC and BTC are two of the most well know alt currencies overall, for example they are the only two that you can use to donate to pirate bay.  Though a lot of people in this sub reddit bash LTC it is gaining traction and and it deserves some consideration.  I personally own both and have nothing to complain about besides not putting more into when I had the chance.

Take some out for everyday use, put most of it in cold storage, make a few copies of the wallet, put at least one storage device in a safe deposit box and a few others in trusted locations. Don't go cash out coins unless you need money for a house or whatever. Think of this as your retirement fund, you'll have a great retirement if you don't blow it all right now. Take ten out and put the rest away in savings where it is protected from that burning hole in your pocket.

I've thought about doing the same. I offered several friends a discount back when it was $100 and none of them wanted any. I've even offered to give a few away and they thought it was a get rich quick scam or just too technologically challenging.  I don't even have much (like you), I just didn't want them to miss out. I don't mention it now and if they ask I just say I'm not quitting my day job anytime soon.

They use it to enforce daily withdrawal limits.  I think the scan clears after a day.

That said, don't spend more than you are willing to lose. If BTC crashes to 0 tomorrow, you don't want to be severely worse off than when you bought in. One tip I think bears repeating is to cash out just enough to cover all or part of your initial investment. I did it and though I regret missing out on some gains, I can safely say I didn't lose any money on BTC and from here on out I am a lot less anxious about this investment.

My advice is to cash out some of your initial investment to lessen the sting if it crashes hard. If you put in $500 @ $100/BTC then take out $250 or even $500 and call everything else gravy.

False equivalency. Ripple is not open source and nearly 99% of the coins are owned by 15 employees of the company that made it. It's as much a crypto coin as ISK from the game EVE, maybe even less so because people actually use ISK and practically no one uses ripple.  The ripple team basically just came out and said, "we have all these credits for sale, who wants to buy them?". They prey on the gullible and those who don't understand the benefit of crypto currencies beyond the price speculation. Without open code and a distributed mining network the coin is worthless as a crypto currency because it won't provide pseudo anonymity, it isn't uncrackable and as far as we know the ripple team retains shadow control over every coin.

How high is your transaction fee set in qt? It could be you have a fee set larger than your balance and the network just ate it. Or it could be you deposited too little to coinbase and they don't recognize it or something. Read their FAQ and see if they have a minimum requirement. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:29:58

Is qt fully synced? If it's a recent transaction and you're not synced then it might not show up until you are, not sure. If there is a status bar on the bottom of the screen then you could have a longer wait ahead of you.

Or you can re-use it as a sort of super up vote to tip others.  
You should still set up a wallet for personal use because even this late in the game you're still an early adopter and the more people who use the BTC economy the more robust it becomes.

You could get 43 BTC worth of dollars sent to you in gift cards and then pay off the loans that way but this too would probably raise some red flags on your loan account. However, if you were just buying groceries or computers then the authorities might not catch on. Basically if it goes to a bank then you'd better report it on your taxes.

This is great exposure for BTC as the Starcraft community hasn't been all that kind to  the currency, thus far. Since two top players have now considered it an acceptable prize, we may see BTC become more popular in tournaments and also among SC players.

I think the point is that it's unlikely she'd have $15,000 in savings working a job that barely pays that amount in a year. She might have qualified for a loan though, a $15,000 loan isn't too difficult to obtain with a co-signer and if she said it was to go back to school then maybe  a family member or two went along with it.

They're the same as those "garbage" talks given to professional athletes and doctors who find themselves wealthy after years of living in the lower or middle classes. These talks are given so people don't go money crazy and lose all that they have worked for. One good example of people who should receive these talks are jackpot lottery winners, a large percentage of whom end up bankrupt after a few years. Many crypto currency aficionados are now  wealthy because they were smart with their money when they didn't have much. Let's hope they stay smart and that talks such as these help them keep a level head in these exciting times.  On a similar note, don't go telling people how much money you have in BTC. Most people don't see it as money yet so they won't think of it as highly private information. By insisting it is private you can not only protect your investment but also help legitimize the currency.

They didn't really cock block crypto, they just ensured it couldn't become a mandatory currency. They basically didn't want it to replace the yuan so stated explicitly that it was to be considered a commodity, similar to gold. Businesses aren't allowed to say they only accept BTC, from what I gathered, but they are still allowed to accept it.

$1000 could be the next psychological wall. Then again China seems to be driving the price right now and they're at 6700 yuan so maybe the next wall is actually at 10.000 yuan which would be $1600.

I agree. If the OP can sell me the same item as amazon for a less cost then they'll get my money.  If amazon is cheaper and also has two day shipping then they'll win almost every time hands down. If a smaller store has a lower price but longer shipping then I'm usually okay waiting an extra week for my stuff. But don't charge  more and then add $10 for 3-5day shipping or else it is right back to amazon for  me.

They'll probably just do an exchange from what he would get in dollars. Say for example that this pay check he makes $1000 after taxes, so they send him 0.876 BTC. Then next pay period comes around and the exchange rate is now $1500/BTC, so he only gets 0.66667 BTC. Then it drops to $750/BTC and that pay period he gets 1.33 BTC. 
That said they might have a legal requirement to have money for salaries on hand for every full time position per year.  In this case they could outright buy 26 BTC and give him 1BTC per pay period regardless of price. 
Either way I think he comes out better in the long run, but the latter example would probably be ideal.

It could be the difference between buying 1 and 1.5BTC. That would be the difference between $100,000 and $150,000.  Not that I'd complain about either.....$100,000 could be a long ways off.

It's probably not a bad time. Many people are selling to help fund a present filled Christmas, I know I did.
