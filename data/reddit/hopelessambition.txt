why is showing his face so important?
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:35:54
why don't you write an exchange then?

The whole point is to send a message to Apple by smashing an iphone 5. and he did that.

@_date: 2013-11-19 02:16:53
What's kraken like? I was originally going to sign up for that but went with Bitstamp.

Is using BitcoinQT more secure than Electrum?
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:54:04
I know about difficulty I read that page before but I didn't think it explained it very well. Do you think that it will ever get as high as 0 again? and what are blocks? I read the blocks page as well but I still dont get it, are they the same as bitcoins?

Icleandish women are really good looking
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:03:14
Downvotes? People were complaining about coinbase running out of bitcoins so why can't I complain about this?
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:31:55
They all require verification now, unless you go with 
here's a couple popular exchanges in Europe.
* kraken.com
* mtgox.com
* bitcoin-24.com
* blockchain.info
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:29:24
what exchange do you use?
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:52:41
How did you get 4500? Mining or did you buy them cheap a year ago
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:20:20
when will it become profitable again?
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:57:41
what about Iceland?
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:59:27
I meant websites, what about coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:12:30
Is that the one you use? I cant see any of their products, how much do they cost?
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:46:14
They also done this with Bitstamp, someone made a phishing website called Bit**i**stamp
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:11:02
Wait....you don't get the coins right away on an exchange?
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:56:13

@_date: 2013-11-17 21:43:12
do they sell the Block Erupter Blade?
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:22:37
How much did you pay for those bitcoins at the time? Like $0.01?

Why is the bank in Slovenia?
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:43:47
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:07:08
I looked but theyre all at least 25% above market value.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:46:19
I signed up but they're just a wallet, how do I buy bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:18:32
Have you tried sending it to another wallet? (Electrum for example) Try it with just 0.001 BTC first to see if it sends.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:19:38
what do I click on to make a deposit?
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:32:13

[shes ugly to you?](
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:05:53
what miner do you use? I'm using GUI right now.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:06:23
Download electrum or multibit you dont need to sync
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:07:48
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:28:42

@_date: 2013-11-18 18:07:28
£500? you cant be serious
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:32:46
Why are Americans so obsessed with China? Yea, China is going to be the next superpower, deal with it and stop crying.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:00:58
Ok, thanks for the help guys. I'm happy it isn't just me.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:33:36
The only problem with your argument is buying bitcoins ISN'T easy, I've been trying to buy some for a week and waiting for my account to verify for 3 days. I've signed up to a dozen websites over the past week, and guess what? I still don't have any bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:20:52
It says Slovenian in the intro, this is their website description


@_date: 2013-11-20 16:36:10
what wallet should I use?
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:09:26
Only the US amazon sells ASICs, and how is it not profitable? I put the numbers into a bitcoin calculator and it said I would make $40 a day. I bet you're running an ASIC right now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:07:55
can you buy coins from Europe with coinbase?


are there better sites?
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:48:22
Would you say that's an advantage or disadvantage about coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:38:05
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:42:49
how do I store coins locally?
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:48:44
The cheapest price on there is 50% more than exchanges
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:02:36
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:46:32
do you need to be 18 to use that site?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:28:39
Thanks, I really want to get in sooner rather than later! The price just keeps going up.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:35:46
whats that mean?
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:19:41
what else is there to pay with? And let's say I bought 2 bitcoins for $650 when would they be in my account, and would I still pay 650 even if the price changes by the time it gets in my account?
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:02:04
How did you verify your account then?
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:24:16
That only has cryptocurrency, how do I buy bitcoins with fiat money?
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:44:57
What causes it to change?
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:06:02
Europe, currently waiting for Bitstamp to verify my account, I bet I still won't be able to buy right away even then. Bitcoin really could become a global currency if it was easier to exchange.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:53:57
my thoughts exactly lol, still waiting for my damn account to verify! It's a pain in the ass!
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:48:53
What do you use to buy your Bit and Litecoins on btc-e? I was wary because the site doesn't seem as secure as some of the other exchanges.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:56:30
thanks for the explanation, I'm just trying to learn here.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:52:25
Satoshi is a Japanese name but he could be British, he used 'British' spellings because British English spelling is the standard used internationally. America is the one who changed the spelling.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:55:30
someone help!!
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:02:09
That seems like a lot of work to me, I'll probably only ever have a max of 5 BTC in my account, I'm guessing you have a lot more than that. How is it people have like 500 BTC anyway? Is it just from buying early?
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:30:30
same here
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:18:12
It's estimated that the mysterious founder owns 1 million Bitcoins, 1/12 of all currently in circulation.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:19:51
Exchange with what? bitcoins?
