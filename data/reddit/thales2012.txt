And when, exactly, will that be?

And then, with the fortune I make off of bitcoin, I'll plunge into tulip futures and rule the world!

Welll, welcome to the internet!

There is no counter-party as long as there is no exchange; as long as you keep your bitcoins all by yourself. As soon as you transfer your bitcoins to another party, usually in exchange for *something* (assuming your transfer is not a gift), there is a risk that they will fail to deliver on their end of the bargain, for whatever reason. Take Instawallet, for example. Or Mt. Gox, Bitomat, Bitcoinica, etc.
But if bitcoin is a new currency, just about the only reason to have it in the first place is to use it for exchange.

OK, I'll put it a little differently. It won't be deflationary unless it is widely used as money, and it won't be widely used as money as long as its price is volatile. Meanwhile, bitcoin is merely a volatile, thinly traded, "virtual commodity", regardless of its price on the bitcoin exchange *du jour*.
Before you get to "everyone buying in", you will have "more people buying in". This fuels the speculative bubble. "When everyone buys in" is when there are no more "bigger fools", the bubble bursts, and "settling down" becomes widely recognized as an impossible outcome.

I take the meaning of counter-party risk very much as you have stated it; "The risk that the other party in an agreement will default." And that risk is inherent in any transaction, multi-party or not, and bitcoin is certainly not free of that risk, which is why I made my initial comment.


Unless you are making a gift, why would you transfer bitcoin to anyone? Because you expect something in return, because someone has made an explicit or implicit promise to give it to you (in other words, a contract), which implies that there is a risk of default. Please note that I am not referring to some illegitimate diversion here, like somebody stealing the mail.


I was not aware that such protocols were an essential part of bitcoin, but that's not particularly germaine. Escrows are a common part of business no matter what the exchange medium.
Edit; BTW, why would you need an escrow anyway if there were no counter-party risk?
It's not that my view of bitcoin is all that negative, but I have seen bubbles before. I would counter that the value of bitcoin has run up in a speculative bubble based on "irrational exuberance" acting in very thin market.  Many of the outspoken proponents of bitcoin stand to profit from its increase in value and are consequently biased in favor of bitcoin, to the point of being unrealistic or outright deceptive.

Not necessarily. Fraud implies malicious intent. Counter-party risk implies a failure to perform.

Not related to Op, LOL. How about this? Some guy called Satoshi Noritake invents bitcoin and "mines" many thousands, perhaps millions of them, (at very low cost) while loudly touting his invention. When awareness and desire for bitcoin take off, he suddenly disappears. A couple of years later, when the bitcoin is traded at more than $10, he starts slowly selling them off. When the price increases even more, he sells more, taking care not to damage the speculative run-up. Sounds better than working for a living! It also sounds like a "pump and dump" scheme made from scratch.

I think "pump and dump" scheme is more accurate, and there's a lot of pumping going on here.

You can't be serious.

Of course, Instawallet couldn't be shorting bitcoin using their clients accounts, could they? 
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:41:58


Not necessarily. Your statement implicitly assumes that demand will increase. Supply is only one part of the pricing mechanism, the other part being demand. There are lots of things that are scarce but not valuable. 
Since there is no "industrial value" in bitcoin, only exchange value (you can't *do* anything with it other than keep it or exchange it), it needs to be widely used in exchange for demand for it to persist.  But volatility, frequent rapid or large changes in its market price, destroy its value as an exchange medium. 
A sudden and large price change, in either direction, will cause either a buyer or seller to regret a recent transaction, which results in a vicious circle. Its price is volatile because it is not widely used as money, and it is not widely used because it is volatile. 
The volatility of bitcoin makes it an interesting toy for speculators, at least until something better comes along and bitcoin is abandoned.

Well, Instawallet purportedly has an enforceable obligation to return the value it was given, determined largely, of course, by the terms of the contract between Instawallet and its client. So it's likely that they can't just take their deposits and fail to return them to their depositors with impunity. But if, due to internet and e-market difficulties, there is some delay, say 90 days, in returning a deposit of bitcoins, and in the  meantime the bitcoins have declined in value from $140 to maybe $40? Well, you deposited your 1000 bitcoins and you got back your 1000 bitcoins, so any legal claim of damages is immediately debatable. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:17:12
If the Instawallet depositor placed funds there without any legal recourse, then there is a name for him. A fool and his money are soon parted.
The same principle may well apply to bitcoin in general. The vaunted anonymity of bitcoin transactions works strongly against enforceability of contracts.
