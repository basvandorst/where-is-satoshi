I don’t see it getting higher than 80k or so.
@_date: 2018-09-15 23:25:22
I remember this. Ugh :/

Bakkt might be bad bitcoin. Caitlin Long writes several good pieces about it.

After 1 confirmation how can things change?
@_date: 2018-09-17 23:01:39
Why wouldn't 1 confirmation suffice?
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:44:52
@_date: 2018-09-29 20:37:06
Doesn’t mean shit. We aren’t getting out of this down market for a while
@_date: 2018-09-23 13:43:13
Last year he said it was going to hit 40k this year, I bought some bitcoin at 16, 17, 18, 19. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:07:32
20% too much?
@_date: 2018-05-23 02:34:58
I’m afraid of this. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 15:52:08
Thanks. Super informative. :)
I thank you good sir ....

"Why does this matter? Bitcoin has algorithmically-enforced scarcity, and that’s a big part of what gives it value. If Wall Street begins to create claims to bitcoin out of thin air, unbacked by actual bitcoin, then Wall Street will succeed in offsetting that scarcity to some degree."
How does leverage-based financialization work?

S&amp;P500 doing great. Compound interest :).
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:25:28
Fuck coinbase
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:16:34
Factor in a 80-90% drop from ATH. What are you thinking we will hit this time around? I’m thinking 30-80k
@_date: 2019-02-19 00:28:08
Why rally in May?
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:09:54
But how had the world been preparing for the demise of the dollar?
@_date: 2019-06-03 13:45:21
How so?
@_date: 2019-06-03 03:30:00
USD might not fail. It is the global currency peg at the moment. I see Bitcoin being Gold 2.0. Global internet money etc. Not the world reserve currency.
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:02:36
Will hit 5-8k on next crash
@_date: 2019-06-03 13:39:13
And it will keep growing. Eventually it might get in a hyper inflated state but the world is dependent on the dollar. I wouldn’t hold my breath and expect a global fiat meltdown anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-06-21 21:10:40
Should have bought 200000k worth. :/
@_date: 2019-06-18 02:40:31
Because we want 150k bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:33:51
Whats with all the effects?
@_date: 2018-11-07 22:37:53
Hal is a gansta. RIP

Fun book :)
@_date: 2018-07-02 21:57:06
Good book. :)
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:23:32
Have them check out Mayer Multiple as well.
@_date: 2018-07-19 23:18:48
I see. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-07-19 22:58:54
Didnt he set hit men on folks ...
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:57:53
No house payment. Less stress. I feel ya
@_date: 2019-05-05 01:58:08
Yeah, my bad
@_date: 2019-05-05 01:58:24
Yup. Your right. Very early
@_date: 2019-05-03 21:18:23
I’d like to own 21 bitcoin :/
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:45:12
you got my upvote ... dumb bots ;)
@_date: 2019-05-04 14:07:39
21btc is 21 million club
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:17:04
He told me it was going to 40k during the bull run. Fell for it.
