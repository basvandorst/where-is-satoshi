What's the limit?

Cheaper than a taxi? Not in Paris (and taxis are already very expensive) =/

Thanks for the answer.
Transactions are too big to be typed, yes - but what is exactly the information needed *by* an offline wallet to create the transaction? Is there something else than the number of Bitcoins needed and the vendor's address? Else, it doesn't seem unfeasible to type it by hand…
In the scenario I imagine, the offline wallet would be an e-book reader - which cannot receive informations via something else than its keyboard, but which can print QR codes on its screen - so if the vendor has a QR code reader, it is easy to transmit some information from the offline wallet to the vendor's machine, but the opposite is hard.

No it doesn't. They've just been arrested and are suspected of different charges. It doesn't mean anything before there is a real trial and judgment.

Same here. I find all the people desperately searching for Satoshi's true identity really disrespectful. How can they support a cryptocurrencty with great privacy properties, and at the same time, try so hard to break someone's anonymity? That's pretty fucked up, in my opinion.

Can an offline phone be used as a wallet? I think that it is not possible currently, but what about the following protocol: the vendor, instead of just displaying his address and the price, also publishes the latest information about the blockchain and everything which is public and could be needed for the buyer to sign the message corresponding to the transaction. Then, instead of directly sending the transaction over Internet, the buyer gives the information of it to the vendor, who then publishes and lets the blockchain verify it.
If it is possible, what would be the amount of information needed to be transmitted from the vendor to the buyer? Could it be small enough to be transmitted "by hand", like using a keyboard? If so, it would mean that e-book reader devices (Kindle-like, but even without Internet) could be used as portable wallets. Why doesn't it exist already? :-)

If the thieves managed to open the safe and understand what was inside, I'd like to see their faces when realizing on blockchain.info that all the Bitcoins were transferred to another address.

Okay, great. An other question: I'm, of course, never connected through the "bitcoin" user. Is it possible to run check_connections.sh and blockchain_progress.sh from another user?
@_date: 2014-08-07 11:22:13
Well, I wanted to run a full node on my server since quite a long time, but the lack of an easy installation process made me procrastinate. Now it's done, thanks to you :-)
Now, what would be great would be an update.sh script, which would look for the latest version of the official client and update it if necessary, and restart the client anyway (in case the config changed) =)
Also, is there a way of checking whether everything is running smoothly, once the blockchain is downloaded?
Edit: by the way, what should I expect in terms of RAM/CPU/bandwidth consumption?

Fascinating post, thanks for sharing.

Both are in french.

Great, thanks!

Hey, can we imagine for half a second that *maybe* having prejudice against Bitcoin does not automatically make someone idiot, but just influenced by the bad press in the media (like pretty much everyone on topics that we don't know much about)?
If your first reflex with someone that does not agree with you (probably because he simply doesn't know as much as you) is to call him an idiot, you're not going to convince many people…
@_date: 2014-10-03 11:47:17
Hi! I'm interested by the results of this as well.
@_date: 2014-06-24 08:56:01
Do you have a detailed source explaining those mechanisms? I genuinely thought that in the case of a 51% attack, there would be pretty much nothing but panic.

I like the quasi-subliminal Silk Road screenshot for "1 Ounce of TRUE OG Kush AAA Top Shelf REAL DEAL" at 0:17.
It's subtle.

Hi! A few questions:
- Does it work outside the US?
- Is it possible to use it to call outside of the US?
- Are you sure that this kind of compagny is legal in the US?
@_date: 2013-11-13 13:01:15
It makes me happy to see that someone gave you gold for this joke.
@_date: 2013-06-25 11:44:44
Hey, that looks exactly like what I needed for a small project I had in mind recently. Thanks for the link!

I see, but this requires that you enter the public address of the seller in your device, so you need a QR code reader or something similar. I forgot to mention: as I was wondering « is my Kobo able to be used as a real-life Bitcoin wallet? », I also assumed that your device has just some computational power and a screen, no fancy things like a way of reading QR codes. And I guess that you really do not want to enter the public address of the seller by hand.
Would you have some additionnal information about this inability to reference the change transactions? I do not really understand what you are talking about…

Damn, I thought and hoped it was in Auckland. Well, I guess I'll visit it when I'll travel in South Island in august.

Hmm. Maybe you should consider removing these aspects to your allegory. First because it kind of ruins the « allegory » aspect, which must be, to a certain extent, credible. I'm ready to believe to a metal which has your magical properties for the sake of the argument, but if you start by saying « oh, you can store information online without having to trust a third-party », that's just weird if you've never heard of it.
And secondly because if you pick a random person walking in a street, he/she will not know what « zero-trust authentification » means, nor will he/she know why not having to trust a third party is important. So, I think it would be more efficient to start with the magical properties, ask the question « Do you think some people would mine this precious metal ? Do you think it would acquire some value ? », and afterwards, if the person you're talking to is interested, explain the other amazing opportunities that Bitcoin allow.

Student currently involved in the last year of Master's studies in theoretical computer science &amp; mathematics here - I'm not a tenured professor but I think I pretty much satisfy your condition of « mastering real analysis, topology, abstract algebra, etc. » - although « mastering » is a dumb word when it comes to such large topics.
Anyway. We were talking about mathematical results related to gambling here, nothing more. Aka « stuff that you can learn in one semester of basic probability theory, and maybe some statistics to understand the law of large numbers ». An engineer has as many reasons to master it than a mathematician, and saying that an engineer can't *truly* understand those topics is just stupidly snooty.
