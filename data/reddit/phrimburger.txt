Thank you for resbonding.  
Government is violence, you can't change that no matter how many btc you have.  Freedom is taken it isn't given.  Governments don't exist only people exist.

While I have no moral qualms with defacing USD, writing bitcoin.org on federal reserve makes me think of the moscow ruless; specifically the rule about not harrassing the oposition.  Also, it could be that if someone first learned about bitcoin in that way they might associate it with vandalism or something negative.  However if I ran across one of your bills, it would make my week(:

I must be spoiled from buying larger quantities direct but I don t consider 1% over market cheap. I prefer 1‰ under market and I'm going to keep trying to get it lower as long as I'm buying coin.  I paid 8%+ a year ago.

Crackdownimg hard on centralized exchanges would be one of the first stepsa, I imagine. However, if the bitcoin community is determined enough, that is a not nearly enough to stop bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-11-17 05:39:15
I think the interconnectedness and interdependence of the bitcoin ecosystem is too complex to fit into a few sentences or possibly to even fully understand at all. Seems like trying to trying to explain all the symbiotic relationships in a rainforest or something to me. 
@_date: 2012-12-01 09:53:22
That's exactly how I did things, the few times I used bitfloor (post hack, pre suck). some people are so carefree with their coins, it amazes me, I guess they are used to things like FDIC and charge backs.
Ive been having good luck with direct exchangers, I love cash&gt;btc at or below market rate(: I guess I'm just assuming a different risk this way, but it hasn't gone horribly wrong yet.
I wish I lived in a bigger city, the closest I have seen someone selling coins f2f is Assn hour away and they want several usd above market rate...i should start selling coins f2f lol 
@_date: 2012-12-29 12:24:54
imo centralized exchanges, mt.gox being the most notable, play a dangerously large role in the btc ecosystem.
@_date: 2012-12-01 03:19:59
Thx for the info. 
Im not a big fan of exchanges tho, too much red tape, high fees, and who knows when it'll get hacked and your coins get stolen.

Ebay owns paypal (I think), they are going to need one hell of a good reason to support bitcoin. 
@_date: 2012-12-05 12:45:38
Given the cut that banks want for their computers to process creditcard transactions, I wouldnt imagine it would be too reasonable :(
I'd be interested to know the AML requirements too. my guess would be they are tedious at least.
I could be wrong about the specific reason they got shutdown; seems like it would be awful foolish of bitme to follow the same treacherous path...
If you are worried about situations like those, I think you'd be better off not relying on centralized exchanges and instead start developing a rep on bitcoin otc and/or relationships with f2f exchangers. If (or when) the government eldecides to crack down hard on bitcoin, centralized exchanges are the obvious starting point.

you use moneygram at walmart. i did it once, they lady thought i was being scammed but it worked, kind of a hassle though. just dont try 711, i atttempted it at 3 different 711s before i went to walmart, none of them had any idea what they were doing.

Monopoly over the money supply is one of the government's greatest powers, bitcoin is a difficult to regulate alternative to fiat and therefore threatening to the statist quo.  I doubt powers that be will stand aside and let bitcoin continue to grow unhindered forever.  I am interested to see if bitcoins (more importantly bitcoin users) are  ready to withstand that onslaught ...
@_date: 2012-12-04 23:15:54
They were basically  using the account in a way that the bank would have charged them more for, and the back caught on eventually. At least I think that's what happened. 
Not Bitfloors choice I'm sure

I agree in this case it is clearly an act of aggression. I  wasn't being clear - I was trying to defend the term prohibition, then I realized I wasn't sure of the exact  definition (if one even exists) well enough to play devil's advocate.  I said nothing that needed sayin
@_date: 2012-11-17 05:30:08
I prefer the regular/traditional/standard/whatever BTC symbol myself, someone who doesn't know how to use a computer would probably understand it to represent a currency; I don't think that would be the case with this symbol or logo.  Its good to have alternatives though - let a thousand bitcoin logos bloom.
@_date: 2012-12-01 10:23:54
I agree, but that doesn't mean all prohibition is illegitimate. I could get behind prohibition of aggression, as long as it wasn't "enforced" by organized criminal gangs,  which is the current setup.
Does prohibition imply aggression? If so,  I retract my support.

In my experience , the deposit location has a lot to do with how much explaining you have to do.  I've tried depositing at 711, no one knew what to do - i gave up after 2nd try.  Walmost deposit worked after i assured the lady i wasn't being scammed. i told her i was buying crypto currency and she didn't seem concerned about me getting scammed  or interested to hear anymore about my silly internet money.   After that I've always used a bank and I've never been asked what i was up to.
If you are well dressed and well spoken  ( friendly, confident and polite  don't hurt either) a bank teller will be more than happy processing your deposits while making idle chitchat.  They do that all day long and won't give you or your transaction a second thought unless you give them a reason to. Or you get very unlucky and get an unprofessional teller.
@_date: 2012-10-22 05:20:27
Bitinstant is convienient but pricey imo. I plan deposit cash and receive coin (with a -.5%fee) from tangiblecryptography tomorrow.
@_date: 2012-12-29 08:56:09
I agree excessive scams, could contribute to bitcoin value in a negative way. However I think its important to consider that an increase of bitcoin scams might be a result of an increase of bitcoin value.
The more bitcoins are worth, the more incentive there is to steal/scam them.
@_date: 2012-10-03 01:08:37
Politicians deserve prison sentences, not bitcoins.  Bitcoin aware/savvy  politicians scare me way more than  typical scumbag politicians. Just because someone will take free bitcoins doesn't  make them friendly to bitcoins.  Look at how politicians treat their own currency - imagine what they'd do to coins when or if they ever get a chance.  Use bitcoins to break out of your chains, not tip the slave masters.  
@_date: 2012-11-16 01:59:47
Bitcoin works well for conducting shady transactions and paying prostitutes; I imagine individual politicians could/do find it useful. 
CIA makes use of tax shelters, I bet they could think of creative ways to use BTC. 
@_date: 2012-11-22 15:43:48
I agree, maybe someone should start an ACLU type organization for cryptocurrency (:
My point about more people(specifically drug users)  coming to bitcoin for drug related reasons, is based off drug users I know. I am certain they (the drug users I know at least)  would conduct business in btc, if bitcoins were easier to get a hold of and use anonymously.

gold was confiscated during the great depression, because it supposedly was harming the economy. i can easily picture the same reasoning applied to bitcoins during the current great recession, bitcoins will just be harder to confiscate. nand since when has the US gov't care about breaking its own laws? the US has gotten the rest of.the countries in the world to go along with all kinds of crazy shit that usn't in of their interests.
don't get me wrong, i don't think bitcoin is doomed or anything, i think its naive to think it will topply the powers that be with no negative consequences.

the value of btc is not pegged to the dollar. people often confuse value with price - the price of 1 bitcoin in usd is ~$27. the value of 1 bitcoin is whatever the person who holds that coin feels it is worth i.e. not necessarily the current market price in usd or even a monetary value at all. if(when) the value of the dollar is destroyed through inflation, the price of bitcoins in usd will rise correspondingly.  bitcoin does not require universal adoption to be sucessful, nor does the current price depend on universal adoption by tomorrow to be maintained.
bitcoins don't "vanish" anyone who understands how to properly store their coins won't have any problems with coins disappearing. bitcoin allows you to essentially be your own bank, anyone who doesn't take atvantage of this aspect of btc and lets someone else store their coins is taking an (optional) risk that they may not get their coins back because they are relying on another person not the bitcoin network to return them.  people/companies that exchange bitcoins will never be as secure as bitcoins; bitcoins are secured by math but exxhanged by humans. when you trade with other people there will always be some risk, this is not a problem that is limited to bitcoins.
you seem to have an irrational hated of bitcoin, do you work for the government or a bank or some other parasitic insitution that bitcoin poses an extistential threat to? if so then maybe your hatred isnt irrational but your arguments against it still are.
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:23:13
npr is just as full of shit as fox news or any other major "news" outlet - their bs is just smoother sounding, which makes emotionally based arguments harder to pick up on and more sophisticated doublethink than fox news type "news"
cryptocurrency is a potentially extential threat to the state, NPR is partially funded by the state, therefore i doubt anyone that works forNPR would be doing their career much good by singing btc praises(like it deserves). i also doubt government radio goons would even be capable of understanding at a fundamental level the multitude of ways bitcoin is liberating/could liberate people from monetary tyranny. NPR/fox/other statist news outlets always seems to unquestioningly take monetary tyranny(or they would probably call it regulation) as necessary and if they happen to be thinking extra hard that day only  debate the degree of tyranny.
i loved npr in my minarchist days, now i find it on average as interesting as conservative talk radio - usually better than scilence:-P
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:08:14
that is a comforting thought. if the many worlds theory is correct, there are potentially an infinite number of captain rons in parallel universes doing the same thing - maybe in a paticularlly awesome universe captain ron only accepts bitcoin for his services and keeps his coins in a paper wallet he hides under his eyepatch.

if btc hits $100 i would only sell what i needed to, hopefully not much. either btc is booming or dollar is crashing or both - either way why would you want usd?
@_date: 2013-04-08 10:25:23
you can't really loose that one lol. reminds me of a $100 bet i made with a coworker a few years back that the world wouldn't end on 12/21/2012...which i still plan to track the guy down and get my winnings(and immediately buy ~.6 btc with it lol).
edit: i guess you could lose if the price somehow fell to $0/btc and then recovered or more likely if the dollar fails and no one is stupid enough to trade btc for worthless dollars (but that might be the opposite of $0/btc ) i hope for the latter(:
@_date: 2013-01-17 05:43:59
that would also work. the number of different ways you can do this is limited only by your imagination.
@_date: 2013-01-12 09:26:33
i don't think people being able to buy drugs online is a bad thing. the war on drugs has claimed tens of thousands of lives, that is "serious casualties".
people use cash to pay for all of those things anyway so its not like bitcoin created those "crimes".
 no one pays for wars with bitcoins however.
@_date: 2013-04-08 10:49:32
you must have a pretty loose definition of 'consistently'.  in my almost 2 years following bitcoin the only thing i found to be consistent was my(and many others) inability to accurately predict the short/near term 'price'. also bitcoin's general awesomeness has consistently increased, but that is probably just because i understand bitcoin and thus bitcoin's potential better now.
@_date: 2013-01-15 15:52:18

thats all the government can do; point guns at things that threaten it. unless something else topples the state first, governments will come down as hard as they can once they understand the magnitude the threat of widespread cryptocurrency poses to them. 
but yeah i agree, outlawing bitcoin would be like trying to get rid of a bacterial infection by hitting the infected area with a bloody flyswatter
@_date: 2013-01-13 00:24:14
you didn't answer my question. bitcoin is so dangerous to the government(not sure why you put it quotes, i am refering primarily to the US government since it is the biggest and most widely engaged in bullying anyone that challenges it into submission) because it threatens their monopoly on the money supply. that monopoly is one of, if not the most powerful tool for theft that the government has at its disposal. the government can't inflate bitcoins willynilly like it does with usd, which is one of the reasons bitcoin is valuable. even if the gov't had a bunch of bitcoins they wouldnt have a monopoly on them, and if they did, bitcoin would lose much of its value. the only reason bitcoin hasnt been cracked down on yet is because of its decentralized nature. look at what happened to previous e-currancies.
of course the US gov't could collapse before bitcoin poses a mortal threat to it, which is hopefully what will happen. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:44:08
bitcoin would continue to 'work' but i imagine there  would be a large price drop. any money that stops working because the government declares it illegal, isn't good money anyway. bitcoin already works well for 'illegal' transactions, imo that is a testament to bitcoin. any currency you cannot use to buy drugs (or any other good/service the government deems illegal) is not a currency i would be comfortable storing much money in - not because i want to use it for such things but because such transactions must be possible for any currency that hopes  to survive in the long run.

Shutting down exchanges, arresting people that are caught with bitcoins, fining financial instutions that do business with people that get caught with bitcoins. Picture the war on drugs but on bitcoins. 
do you really think the government will just sit back and watch bitcoin become a major competitor to the dollar? They will do everything they possibly can to stop it.
That's not to say they will be successful. If the bitcoin community is determined, I don't think they will be able to stop us.
