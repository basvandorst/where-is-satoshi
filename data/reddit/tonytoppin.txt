Is it on way back machine?

All arguments are ignoring the additional fix for transaction malleability which was also part of this fix and was entirely necessary. Also it fixes asicboost.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:51:19
Thats a different thing entirely. Thats bitcoin becoming a recognized currency.

Bitstamp has in their terms 3 days. But this is not the point, they have acknowledged they have the funds as they have done for many others in a similar position. They are just not crediting them and apologizing. Why not just nail it down, either credit them or return them. Ive used them for a long time, and this is most unusual.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:06:57
ok, you know best. Switch to a coin you like. Theres loads to choose from
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:35:35
They already exist and are in major usage. I have friends using them for a while now
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:11:17
Its on top of their deposit page. 
"... your SEPA deposit will be credited in 1 - 3 business days..."
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:40:04
No response from support for many. tens of thousands of dollars in limbo
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:16:45
No Im just sick of talking about it. end of.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:50:08
Incorrect, Ive been a customer fully verified for months with regular deposits in amounts of 20k plus. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:32:46
He charges thousands for talks all over the world. i dont think hes starving
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:54:11
True but I didnt have it before bitcoin either so its hard to part with.
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:09:40
How is it a P2SH transaction electrum, address starts with a 3? Didnt know they did these in electrum

I received similar last year, a threat to my family of anthrax sent to them bought from the darkweb. It went in tangent with a DDOS on a site I own. I wasnt that busy as it was a Sunday so I just didn't reply, the DDOS went on until late that day. They issued a second similar threat and then moved on. Nothing happened. 
So I would go with dont engage. These threats would take a lot to accomplish and a very bad person to do so for 1k. It plays on an emotional hook like chain mail. Chances are high its nothing.
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:54:35
Didnt realize. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:15:15
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:58:21
Agreed wholeheartedly. Very well put. I shall do the same. Thanks bitcoin, this shit is mental.
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:31:43
I like Favians one here
I was thinking of implementing a local currency with this. Small blockchains that could be timestamped for integrity with the bitcoin blockchain really give power to people to set up some kinds of distributed ownership/voting rights etc. Colu had a good system but I went on to their lately and they have 'pivoted' I guess as its some kind of payment thing now.
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:32:02
So the wallet app you used to have is gone? And the online site for making your own coloured coins is also?
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:10:54
Hey colu , where's the open source implementation of your coloured coins wallet. Last I looked your homepage is some new payment app thing with no mention of bitcoin or coloured coins
@_date: 2017-02-08 18:07:50
Were you there when Roger Ver abused his access to blockchain.info data to peruse someone he had sent coins to in error?
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:59:43
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:56:52
Cool, thanks
@_date: 2017-01-30 17:16:06
I agree, this is contrived. And as for your assumptions, many do believe there is a plan on to trap us 'in the system'. Jim Rickards lately believes this is exactly what the plan is. Inidia's demonetization was a test run.

Lighthouse by Mike Hearn, didnt take off though look it up. Was a bitcoin fund-raiser app, it gets funded or your money back.
@_date: 2017-01-22 09:27:57
Hey Charlie, how are you doing since they released you. Considering what you said above, you think Rogers way forward is a good one?
I have a lot of respect for you man, I built a business like yours (outside the US) and Im still going. You go rolled by bad laws. Im currently getting rolled by the war on cash but it gave me a good gig for a few years and I probably helped a lot of people into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-23 18:25:49
I want to know this also
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:48:41
thanks, will check it out
@_date: 2017-01-30 18:30:08
Exactly. Try it out on the undeserved first, they have less opportunity to revolt.

List of Attendees?
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:23:03
A guy in college told me about bitcoin about 6 years ago...didn't really understand it at first. 
6 years later I now go out with that same guy and we run a bitcoin related business that he started.
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:46:43
I have two trezors, still wouldn't have protected my exchange accounts. I dont just hold.
@_date: 2019-01-03 08:38:36
It is. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 12:42:36
Also, the version number is not a whole number another clue as per beta naming convention I. E. 0.17.1 is the current release. It hasn't crossed 1.0.
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:03:12
They're too young around here, I get it man. Bravo
@_date: 2019-01-03 12:40:22
I know what it means, it's still in beta:
Ongoing development - Bitcoin software is still in beta with many incomplete features in active development. New tools, features, and services are being developed to make Bitcoin more secure and accessible to the masses. Some of these are still not ready for everyone. Most Bitcoin businesses are new and still offer no insurance. In general, Bitcoin is still in the process of maturing.

Cool, nice work man. Can you give a breakdown for a non tech? 
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:04:09
Been hitting that button like a crack rat here for 4 hours. No dice
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:29:54
Yep that's the one I'm having
