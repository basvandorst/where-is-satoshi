Seemed to me like the point of that video was to buy bitcoin while it is cheap. They skewed the numbers a bit to favor the point as much as possible, just like everyone else fighting to get viewers/readers. It's a positive for the currency and that's all that can be said about it as they are treating it just like any other story.
