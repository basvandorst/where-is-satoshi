Although you make backed and defendable points, I'm not sure this is the kind of thread you'd want to make them on.
Once again, I'm not arguing that you're wrong, but I believe all u/barking_bonerz needs right now is support

@_date: 2017-03-18 14:43:44
I don't get it. Selling high and buying low seems ok to me. I must be missing your point
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:37:18
Okay, I guess I shouldn't keep refreshing my btc widget... I haven't even put any money in it. What do you recommend for buying BTC?
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:21:58
Wow nice mate, hodl on! I kinda regret not having bought before but I guess I'll regret later if I don't buy now! 
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:35:31
Wow I feel you. Thanks for the answer. I shall hodl.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:20:35
I have to admit you're right, it's quite discouraging. But it's exciting at the same time. I'm going to buy within 3 days.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:36:04
thanks! I just opened this before seeing your comment
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:34:24
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:40:10
I didn't realize this was a thing. Thank you
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:30:29
You're hella right, good thing I didn't buy. But now it's kinda going back up above $1000. It still could drop lower right?
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:34:15
Thank you for your answer. I didn't say anything about those drops, just asked whether they were common. I sure am excited about putting some of the money I don't need (thanks for the advice, I already read that several times and it's cool to see people caring about other people), and am currently looking to buy some. What do you recommend ? Coinbase ?
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:38:34
Wow really ? I thought exploiting drops was part of the "game" (iknowitsnotagameitsrealmoney)
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:46:36
Ahah ok, that's actually what I started to read at first but for some reason I read a second time. I guess in the perspective of hodling, buying a bit high at the moment makes sense then.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:58:24

I'm not that experienced but I've been here since roughly $1000 and people were friendly and taught me about things so I try to give back. Of course there always are people bashing and criticizing (not constructively) but if you just ignore them everything's great !

@_date: 2017-11-03 15:02:12
Bitcoin isn't USD. Or EUR. Or whatever fiat money you're referring to. 
Its fluctuation is not in control of anyone, and it's regulated by the law of supply and demand itself. You don't just put $100 worth of Bitcoin in your mattress and exchange it for $100 ten years later. You could do that with your average fiat money, but not with Bitcoin.
The fact that Bitcoin's fluctuation itself is so important turns "saving" into "gambling". That was my point.
Don't get me wrong though, I'm all about that HODL. It just isn't the same thing, and XBT is meant to be used.

BTW thank you guys for your reactions! It's always interesting to discuss Bitcoin IMHO
I'd like to point out that I'm not shitting on cryptocurrencies in any way, I found this article and I thought you would find it interesting too!
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:44:42
Other topics would come up naturally, but since nothing is mentioned in my post, it's pretty safe to assume that I'm talking about what the subreddit is about; and not a parallel topic

I think the comparison with a 60 floor office tower isn't exactly fitting because we're talking about the daily needs of 8 households **per transaction**, which is huge! 
But I understand where you're coming from, and the numbers can't really be boiled down to a simple and objectively true comparison anyway.
ps: btw I'm not trying to convince you that it's a problem, but it's always good to know more about the things that we use!
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:39:24
This was on a thread about Bitcoin possibly dropping soon (cause it just keeps rising and this guy said that it was inevitable). I picked this comment in particular because it was a response to a valid claim but all of this guy's comments just screamed But I understand that my title can be kinda off without context
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:58:38
I know it's mining XMR but I think you guys would be interested anyway.

As for the "saving is gambling" thing, when it comes to Bitcoin that's pretty much the same thing

I think you shouldn't resell even if you're at a "loss". So far, Bitcoin has proved itself to always be profitable, given enough time.

Anyhow, he will post the pics of the hamster power plant. And the bear hamster-wheel. A few people will thank him for it. 99% of you will begin anew with the insults, accusations, and finally the posts about how he just photo-shopped the whole thing.
You guys are lucky he still posts it. Very few here deserve what he provides for free.

I haven't checked but I'm pretty sure there is, though a good smart watch would be overkill in my case (and a bad one would be... bad)
@_date: 2017-07-02 14:05:42
your definitely missing his point
@_date: 2017-07-03 07:18:54
So far the Pebble seems to be the only watch that corresponds to what I'm looking for.
It's a shame the company doesn't exist anymore and they don't produce anything. I could find it on Amazon but no real warranty etc. 
All the other cheap smart watches just copy the layout of the Apple Watch and it looks like they just can't meet the expectations they advertise.

I get your point, though I don't think my request is excessive
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:35:59
nah I just thought "eh that'd be cool if I could check the price of btc on my watch" so i made a post to ask if it existed but wasn't widespread enough for me to find it with a simple google search

Wow calm down there. I know this isn't the right mindset when it comes to Bitcoin.
I was just making a funny, yet partially true statement.
If you're here to explain why we should spend Bitcoin, do it without the "idiot" and "Morons" please
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:13:28
give me half of it or I'll tell your boss!
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:02:20
Thanks for your comment! Indeed I have written down my seed and I also have the wallet.dat but now it looks like I f*cked up when I bought the Bitcoins.
I mean, the 0.1BTC (yeah, that much) used to show up until today in Armory, but either the address has changed or it somehow disappeared, idk. 
I guess I lost 0.1BTC then ahah. Anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:27:39
I know that's not the way I should think of it, but I would never be able to buy a pizza with Bitcoin.
I know I would look back on it several years later and contemplate my $200 pineapple topping
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:14:44
I agree. It seems to always bring up questions about legality or reliability. And it's justified: as a matter of fact, this was my first approach to Bitcoin. 
But reading a bit about it, I realized how silly it was.
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:49:23
Oh ok! Thanks and have a good day!
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:32:57
[just saying](
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:44:28
You have a point. However, no need to change their entire payroll system. I can just agree with them as I've heard of services before that do this for you (basically it simulates a bank account that redirects everything to your bitcoin address). But the question wasn't really there in the first place
@_date: 2017-06-27 06:32:13
I don't stick to this viewpoint because I want to, it's just that I can't help but see the potential of Bitcoin every time I think about it. So much so that I couldn't spend it if I had a good amount of it (I probably won't pay for anything with the sharp 0.1000 that I currently have access to. I'll just buy more and hodl).
But, once again, you guys are right and it's just my stupid HODL mentality that took over
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:36:34
I'm not sure if what I have is a proper master seed though...
It's a 2 lines 18 word long (18 total, not per line) passphrase constitued of 4 letters long "words". Not actually words but random letters. Would look like "ghut sdor sdoz qpml..." etc.
Other than that, yeah I sent a message to the guys from which I bought the 0.1btc to ask them what was the target address of this transaction. Hopefully it'll help me comprehend the situation a little more.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:35:12
Hi, I've made a wallet using the Armory software. Is it safe and will it be affected by the UASF?
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:26:26
My worthless opinion is that if you're ready to spend 5k into something you don't really know, buy bitcoin not mining hardware
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:17:16
Guess you're right, unless the contract is something like "pay me a given wage in bitcoin, but according to an EUR value". That way they don't spend more money as BTC goes up and down but at the same time I can end up having only a few bitcoins whereas I could have gotten way more if I had done it myself (buying when low, not at the end of each month)
-which, I guess, answers my question
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:44:45
thanks! is it worth it with a high end gaming graphics card? I know it's not optimized but will I lose more money than I'll make?
I'm willing to help Bitcoin if I can but not at too much of a loss
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:21:35
Okay so I'm not sure I understand all of this.
From what I get, the chain split may cause bitcoins to disappear? And how do I "replace the bundled bitcoins with the Core+BIP148 version"? Sorry for being a noob

why do I only find marijuana related results on google? are you trolling me?
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:35:34
Hey! That's it!
Thank you so much.
What I did first was follow the instructions in the link you sent me (in Armory: Backup Wallet -&gt; Export Key List).
There I found out there were 2 addresses for some reason (maybe that's the way it is, anyway), and I checked them both on blockchain.info. And one of them had, indeed, 0.1btc on it!
So I took the corresponding private keys and restored the wallet in Electrum. At first it froze but then I removed the spaces and it worked. Now it shows up in Electrum and I now have access to the .1btc. Fantastic!
One question remains though. Originally I updated Armory because I wanted to avoid losing anything on August 1st (maybe it sounds silly to someone who actually knows how it works, but idk). Now I'm wondering, will anything happen to my coins? I plan on buying more in July.
Thanks again! I would never have guessed how to recover that ahah.

I'm using armory on my pc as a full node to check my paper wallet every so often. Will anything happen to my BTC "wealth" ?
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:18:53
Yup I'll do that it seems to be the most appropriate option. I can buy as much BTC as I want, whenever I want and it's not determined by a contract.
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:16:24
I own 0.1 BTC
am I not a schmuck anymore?
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:01:48
Yes armory is a full wallet and it still syncs when launched
The balance problem has been solved though!
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:18:21
Maybe something bad happened because of the passphrase? It asked me to create one just now but I already had one so...
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:50:28
I already assumed my position was bad. No bailout. It's actually the first line of my first comment.
And I agree that your reasoning is correct. Once again, first sentence of my comment.
I'm not trying to school you about anything. I'm just asking if you can be at least a little bit polite when it comes to teaching stuff to other people.
Sorry about the hundred other people who made the same comment.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:42:06
Thank you for your answer. Great little website btw, you may want to add a list of other softwares for people like me, maybe? I'm sure such a list can be found on the internet if not on this subreddit. (maybe that's just a waste of time)
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:15:17
I'll do that now.
I checked the address on blockchain.info though, and it displayed 0.0BTC and no transaction ever.
It seems weird to me that I would've bought Bitcoins for the wrong address initially, but still saw it for months on Armory. The BTC were spendable and confirmed too.
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:16:26
I did both, and still nothing shows up in the wallet! Now I'm afraid it may be lost. I have no clue where it went though...
