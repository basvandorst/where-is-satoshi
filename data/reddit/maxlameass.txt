Ok. Well maybe not out of business. I understand they establish and maintain credit ratings and what not. However, if I went into my local coffee shop, and bought a coffee on my card, and it charges them 3% to use that card; or I used a Bitcoin account, and it charged them .01% to use that; don't you think people would be more apt to use and accept bitcoin, and would deal a huge blow to credit card companies?

Every time it drops a couple hundred I invest a little bit more.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:27:06
What are some other good ones to use?
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:07:40
Yep. That's me. Didn't know what else to use. Still dont really. Worried about getting scammed. Knew coinbase was most popular so I said fuck it. Made first purchase Dec 31. Said it will be Jan 10 when I get it. Still don't know if it'll even drop then.
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:05:34
You do you
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:52:34
Cold and calculated. I can dig it.

"can you explain to me what EXACTLY is the benefit of using Bitcoin"
I've been thinking about that a lot and here are a couple cool things I've come up with.
-transferring money all around the world for very little transfer rate. Most people know about this one.
- if crypto stabilizes and becomes widely accepted I think it would basically put credit card companies out of business, as businesses wouldn't have to pay what they pay to accept credit cards.
-i could put my Fiat currency into crypto for travel and not have to pay international exchange fees (some credit cards do this but not many, and you usually have to pay a yearly fee).
Those are just a couple cool ones I've thought of.
Edit- when I say credit card I mean debit card.

Go on.....

Ethereum is the only thing keeping me afloat. Got in at $745. Bought my first bit of Bitcoin at 14 and then tried to catch the knife. Last purchase was around 12 ��‍♂️
Edit: ain't selling shit though.
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:08:02
No sir. In the immortal words of the band "Clutch"; "whenever it feels right"!
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:08:13
Think I'm just gonna hold, man.kind of a little investment in the future type thing.
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:26:28
Well yeah. No shit. Do you buy for the past?
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:07:27
No no no. You're right man. Sorry. I often just use debit card and credit card interchangeably.  I'll edit that in my comments.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:18:59
They call it the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe that shit
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:27:41
I bought around there ( not enough to destroy me). Then tried to catch the knife, as they say. Now, might as well just go down with the ship and call it a learning experience and just see what happens in the future. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:09:09
You might want to get something with a lambo design.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:43:15
Do elaborate.....
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:28:06
That's my thought
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:42:24
Scott trade. Invested in a company and a mine
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:21:22
Looking into that too. How do I trade Bitcoin for that (I'm new). Any thoughts on dragonchain?
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:39:15
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:43:56
That's crossed my mind as well. Still have a bit of things to toss around and learn. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:17:41
If the whole world became dependent upon it though, I think that'd drive the price up. Hell I think I bought at $.03 per share. So, even if it went up to a couple dollars per share I'd be in good shape.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:16:20
No point in moving $250. I'll just sit on it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:22:58
Well, what the hell are you investing in?
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:44:01
Eh. Just don't claim any of it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:01:00
Bit if it's eventually used to start making batteries, TV's, computers, etc you'll eventually have to mine it., Like salt from the sea.... At least that was my thought behind it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:32:33
They're still working with it. I invested for the long hall (like Bitcoin) hopefully it'll be the material of the future. So many cool applications for it. It just hasn't gotten to a cheap enough production level to be viable yet. Of course, they may always find a better material by that time. Fuck if I know.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:18:53
Wish I had of know what I was doing in 2014 when I was checking out Bitcoin. I didn't know how to get into it. Instead I bought into graphene..... Which hasn't done shit, really.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:07:40
Should have nutted up at 1am this morning though ��
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:28:00
Copy that. I wanted to buy with USD a couple of days ago, but apparently I can't do that and have to wait til the 10th for my btc to clear.
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:07:04
Nah. You're good. Just hunker down and ride the wave, brah. We are all just a spec in the spectrum. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 01:51:15
Thanks for the answer! I'm just a hodler. Don't pretend to use crypto for trading purposes. However, after all the damn research I've done, maybe i should dable a bit.
@_date: 2018-05-04 01:42:25
How do you short bitcoin,?
@_date: 2018-05-04 03:58:41
Which part? 
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:53:57
Except Doge. I've made $8 with Doge and have lost 500 with btc and ethereum. Hodli g like a fuck duck over here.
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:32:49
Totally gonna dump to around 3-5 again. But if you hodl on to it I'm sure it get back above 10 again..... Next year.
Edit: just my stupid opinion.
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:36:46
Fixed it for ya

Weather man tells me similar things about the weather.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:17:34
Well, I never pulled anything out to take a gain. 
Also, I don't have even a $1000 in it. So whatever.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:12:09
Could go either way. As of 2/18  the buyer got it for a steal.
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:19:37
Couldnt you just transform it back to Fiat as soon as you you received payment? Of course you could always let it ride too.
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:13:17
I was wondering about that. Thanks. But I was was probably down $25 on Dec 31.
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:08:02
Offering reward in Fiat currency?! Pfft get the fuck outta here. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:07:20
"gentlemen, there is a solution here that you after not seeing" ��
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:06:00
Especially if the person bought them for 300 per coin, or some shit like that.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:15:20
I didn't get in early enough. Think I bought in after Christmas when it was going way up.  So now I'm hodled up til it gets back to that and still putting in. May take a couple years to see it back at 14k. Really wish I had bought in when I originally wanted to (2014). Just didn't know enough about it or how to get into it.
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:53:50
Ok. I laughed. Up doot to you.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:16:57
Don't think they give a shit that I've lost money.
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:14:40
Damn. Thank you guys for all the awesome answers! Some of which are still over my head, but others getting me that much closer to rapping my mind around Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:37:37
Well then, that makes me wonder if there will be a cap on miners for as low as possible fees.
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:51:08
I'll pull earnings if it makes it to 20k. But I'll always keep in some hodl
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:07:10
As someone who started in at 14, and has the hodl faith; take your upvote, you bastard.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:22:23
Me too. But at the same time, I also really believe in all the tech that is going on. I won't get rich off of it. And I'm not really looking to. If it happens, cool. If not, that's cool too.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:57:37
Funny because it has been asked a million times? 
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:10:05
Yeah. I'm new myself. Started to dig into this stuff in December. I read the papers and all, but the answer seemed a bit vague. Was wanting to get some other ideas on the topic. Got some great answers too. However, even those seem a bit washy.
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:11:02
So miner is a potential job of the future��.... Or at least a side job? I mean, you won't be mining anymore so you won't need liquid cooled super processors, just a simple set up to do basic computing?
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:50:39
That's what I figured. I wonder if it'll be worth it. I suppose if it goes worldwide it may be, but if there are too many miners it won't be?
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:17:32
Thanks. Great answer
@_date: 2018-03-19 02:18:15
I'm glad I'm not the only one that still laughs and quotes this.
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:54:54
And that is the way I feel balogna should be spelled.
