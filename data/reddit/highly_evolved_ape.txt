Ugh. He's saying if tx fees weren't high as they are and took hours the fork would never have happened in the first place. Read the whitepaper, blocksize was never meant to be capped at 1MB.

Why are people who like bitcoin shills?

Just because you call a horse a zebra doesn't mean it's a zebra, buddy. Bitcoin cash has all of the features outlined in the whitepaper. Core does not.

Not your bank account, but your salary (and tax contribution) is public information in finland.

would have never been created if would not ban dissenting opinions. Same for really. bans conservative opinions and therefore it becomes a DNC echo chamber. People have no one to blame except mods.

Do you believe the core devs are incapable of making it fast and cheap? Lol. They know exactly what they are doing. You have your head far up your own ass.

In your comment.

Bitcoin cash. We both know that bitcoin stands for fast, cheap micropayments. And core doesn't offer that.

Everyone who owns bitcoin also owned bitcoin cash "this whole time". How is that surprising? That's literally what a hard fork means.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:33:21
A forked coin is not an attack. Everyone is free to fork bitcoin.

ETH is doing a lot more transactions than BTC. Yet not expensive.

Just because you call a sluggish, expensive blockchain a bitcoin, doesn't mean it's bitcoin. It's not what was described in the whitepaper. Transactions are not instant. Fees are not near free. It's not bitcoin and you know it. Bitcoin cash is the original bitcoin and core is a sham.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:13:50
Ethereum is doing more transactions than BTC and yet has much lower fees. It is intentional.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:46:34
Yes it is. And it's called bitcoin cash.

Roger Ver couldn't single handedly take down bitcoin if tx fees and confirmation were reasonable. Just look at the front page of this subreddit, it's full of complaints confirming what he says: bitcoin is completely useless as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:59:41
Lol. Every cryptocurrency is "manipulated" by companies, including bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:53:22
Ugh. Satoshi intended for bitcoin to be forkable when things go south.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:08:35
And the head mod of this subreddit owns this subreddit, bitcointalk, and bitcoin.org, all at the same time.
