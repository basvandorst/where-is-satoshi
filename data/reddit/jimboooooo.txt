Well it appears thousands of bit-coiners have lost alot of money due to their trust issues while a very very few have profited handsomely. Also you would think after this point, bitcoins ability to be even close to foolproof would become apparent. It just seems like a scam, in which most of the initial backers cashed out at the 1000 mark, dumping their coins. leaving every one else to make up excuses as to why its still legitimate as their wealth decrease every day on their computer screens.

Just like real world money, why not put it under your mattress, would it now be safer then leaving it with companies that has no concrete understanding of financial or get hacked at a predictable rate?

Ya but it  seems like it is all speculation, susceptible to pump and dumps and such. And it makes it more seem like a scam when the practical use is very limited and significant amount of it used to speculate with the sole purpose to create real money for its users.

I forgot Bitcoin does not like non-conforming opinions

So online you are at risk of hackers and exchanges going offline with all your money, and offline you are at risk for everything you stated above. Then why bitcoin, why not use Paypal or just online banking?

Again, you can't Photoshop real money.... so why is this currency superior, or even practical?

That's probability why i am so confused, the community acts like Bitcoin is the  second coming of Jesus Christ.

In your opinion, how many bit-coins are used online to speculate compared   to people who just have hard copies and store their wealth on them. It seems like alot of people on the reddit bitcoin subreddit are speculating, which does not bode well for the future of the currency.   
@_date: 2015-01-07 03:29:56
And Lets you be victims of hackers and speculators 
@_date: 2015-01-07 06:26:17
You also just make up facts 
@_date: 2015-01-07 03:11:08
So why not just use real money, if you are not just using the bitcoin to speculate and make a quick buck(coin)?
