Oh agreed, it is a giant waste of tax payer dollars. Makes for a good read though.
Vicariously I...

Well, as you used the term 'divested' in reference to BTC, I think it is treated more as a commodity than as a currency. I think that is the point you are making as well. People hope to buy in and for the value to increase and then to dump it to make a profit. Pump and dump, it may as well be a penny stock.
Every single time I hear people talk about BTC it is like they are talking about the stock market and not currency. Proof is in the pudding.

You're probably right, but the fact that the FBI has a image hosted on that server now says they control it. 
It is fun to troll people because they think they are using a secure technology without actually knowing what the fuck they are doing eh?
And it certainly is not out of the question, the FBI did it before to a TOR site.

Speaking of which, I bet the FBI let the site run since June with some fun XSS that allowed them to identify users.

Pump and dump.

Well the first rule of the stock market is nothing is a sure bet ;)
Second rule is the past is not a reliable guide for the future trend.
Third rule is hindsight is 20/20.
Good luck to ya, but I will keep my monies in mid-cap plus sized companies for the time being.
Edit: Forgot, buy low sell high!

So with that noted, I am willing to bet money the FBI also set up some fun XSI to identify the TOR users.
EDIT: I would not be worried for the buyers, but the major sellers should be sweating if they have not already been arrested.

Back in July I believe? The real question you should be asking, if you used that website, is if there had been a sting operation in which the FBI allowed the servers to run with some nasty XSS that identified users.
Whoops!
