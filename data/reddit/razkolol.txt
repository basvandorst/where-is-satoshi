This is called unprofessionalism, Gdax/Coibase should get a real CEO not one that is shitting on the financial asset that generates the most revenue for his company. If he's feeling that strongly that BTC is getting "dethroned" he should remove it from his exchange, let's see if he has the balls to do that.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:42:06
Ah the classic "bitcoin core forked from the main blockchain, bcash is the new bitcoin, the old blockchain is dead" propaganda from bcash sock puppets. This is old stuff, it's like they're not even trying anymore.. at one point Ver wanted to implement Lightning on Bcash w/o segwit, remember that? They were trying back then xD
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:50:00
The lambo has cool bitcoin owners in it.
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:32:55
Because your average Joe will not do research by himself, not having the brain power to do so, so he will look at the grades and choose accordingly, this is a good thing for the space tbh if the ratings are accurate, it will protect noob investors from buying bad shitcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:15:27
Be smart, by hodling all the time there's opportunity cost, when it hits new aths take some profits out (10-20%) so you have liquidity for times like this in order to buy the dips ;)
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:54:43
It's getting ridiculous, the fucking CEO of Coinbase is tweeting that "bitcoin has scaling problems" and retweets "btc is getting dethroned" and other shit when they are incapable of adding segwit and sending the BTC for free like Bitstamp does, Bitstamp has always covered transaction costs, why can't Coinbase add segwit and cover the costs aswell? Maybe because of greed or incompetence?
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:11:55
Amazing how they calmed down for a few weeks but now that lightning is starting to go live they're starting an all out attack xD
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:28:18
If you're irrational and would do it that doesn't mean that everyone else is, some people have better things to do than renting servers to host Ver's nodes on it xD Since you're the only "person" (i'm trying hard not to use an insult instead of person here) that would rent servers to host nodes that's called centralization.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:16:43
Attacking the bitcoin name is the only card they have left if lightning goes live, it's literally their only little play that's left, pathetic really.
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:54:10
Money? You mean fiat? USD? Nah man that shit is crashing for years now, why would you sell your bitcoin for that shit..
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:21:59
I'm just here for the lambo.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:48:16
I care big time, if it dips to 7-8k I wanna be there buying.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:35:58
Even if he said this directly to their face they are not entitled to steal his money, they could decline his business and refund him the full amount.
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:44:46
Yea  but now they're shitting on LN again so who knows.
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:31:33
Inflation is the thing eating away your purchasing power, you're just making my point. Explain to me why an infinite supply of money backed by thin air is better than a finite supply of money.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:44:43
I like Bitcoin.de &amp; Bitstamp but i'm from EU, for US Gemini is probably your best bet.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:07:28
Im sending money to exchanges like crazy, 11k btc what a deal.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:20:06
Holy shit imagine all the bitcoin we could buy for 40$, it would be 2012 all over again.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:23:41
same thing happened to me bro, i feel ya
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:59:55
Now that's a point we can all agree on.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:24:44
You must be an expert in that investment strategy that I've been hearing a lot about lately, the "Buy high sale low" investment technique, a lot of people practice it, combined with panic selling and posting "bitcoin is headed to 0!!! SELL!!" on reddit right after.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:47:02
I want to be there watching, last big dip i bought the whole way through the dip (until 5.5k), you don't want to have all your money on a single buy order in case it goes lower.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:38:13
The skill involved is HODL. Can you hodl? Do you have what it takes?
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:36:12
You're right, silly to even compare the 2, one of them has a finite supply while the other one can be printed all day 24/7, historically one of those holds value better then the other.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:00:53
He's not attacking your character, just your lack of intelligence that spit out the "rent a server" argument xD Did you have a training session with Ver before he let you loose on reddit?
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:08:19
I'm amazed that over at the users are agreeing with this move. I mean how brainwashed can you be to agree to something like this... moves like this make BCH lose a shit ton of credibility in the space as a coin that can stand on its own... If i was invested in BCH i would like for it to do its own thing and grow, not this shit...
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:30:58
Why are we still discussing Bcash? They gave us free coins &gt; more btc; price dips &gt; cheaper btc; some funny interviews with Ver flipping people off, it was fun and all but now they got nothing more to offer beside ripping off bitcoin, time to move on to new forks :D
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:36:38
But Ver said that cash coin thinggy will also receive LN in an interview, when is that planned for? Or is fixing the random block size a priority?
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:27:39
*when not if, and it has already started
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:19:36
You expect a big part of BCH's userbase to rent a server and to host a node on it?
1. Centralization, it will be only on the cheapest available servers (if by some miracle people will actually do this);
2. No one is going to do it, because what the fuck xD
3. Why not rent a quantum computer while we're at it, and make Petabytes blocks, fuck it.
If you don't realize that this is absurd you have bigger problems than crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:20:43
Desperate times call for desperate measures. Btc is down, he needs some extra money.
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:32:21
Bitstamp has segwit since september and they batch their transactions and pay for the fees. Why is anyone still using coinbase? I'm sure there are plenty of other exchanges out there that can take care of fees and batch their transactions, if one of them can throw a user friendly interface over it it's game over for coinbase if they don't get their act together.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:02:16
Here in my parent's basement, just bought this new Lamborghini with them crypto gains, but you know what I like even more than toy lambos? KNOWLEDGE.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:14:13
Fuck no. Bitcoin is bitcoin, anything else that forks from it can call themselves whatever they want, the original name should never change because of an alt-coin lol
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:03:34
The lambo has cool tech in it. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:06:25
Lambos are expensive to run, instead of buying fuel for your lambo you can have a ford pinto and invest in crypto, win-win.
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:32:02
Or he could unload them on multiple exchanges, plenty of buyers, we've been waiting for a 8k $ dip for a while here..

Lel, you got all of that from "hahahaha", impressive.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:38:01
I feel you bro, I lost some btc during that whole scheme, bitcoin was breaking all resistance levels, wanted to sell &amp; rebuy lower but got screwed xD I learned my lesson at least.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:32:06
Ripple already killed BCH in market cap, BCH is starting to look like a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:53:55
Ver is prob laughing now, his fakecoin is 3.7k he made hundred of millions out of thin air. Btw congratz on using those "critical thinking skills" by telling random people on the internet how much money you made, smart ;)

I think your nostrils might be a little off because of all the Bcash bullshit that you've been inhaling xD
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:50:50
Altcoins don't have cult leaders spreading bullshit about Bitcoin, they have real devs who work their asses off. Also they don't use the Bitcoin name to scam newbies who are just getting into the space, so yea BCH deserves the hate.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:41:15
It costs me 0$ to move 40$ around my house, transaction speed is also pretty good, depends how fast I move around. Fiat money is clearly superior to your BCH since it costs me 0$ and I can also wipe my bottom with it, can you wipe your bottom with BCH? I don't think you can.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:11:02
He stole bitcoin's code, he stole the bitcoin brand, and he's telling everyone that it's the "real bitcoin", yep everything checks out, phishing site.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:36:27
When there are people rushing out you know it's the right time to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:34:35
I was born in an eastern-european country, when I was young my parents/ family used to hold money in german marks or USD, before the euro took off. Did they use this currency to buy things? Do you think local shops accepted transactions in those currencies? No, or they did only for big ones, like buying a car or a house. Do you start to see how bitcoin is taking this role away from USD and German marks at the time?
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:58:28
Taking over? You guys are being brainwashed hard by Ver, Ether has a market cap higher than BCH yet i don't see people who are investing in Ethereum coming here with comments like "ETH/BTC is up, you suckers are going down, ETH KING!!" maybe because they're not part of a cult.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:29:32
"Nah bro the fees are insane, I transferred yesterday 100$ of btc and I paid 5000$ in fees, bcash is the real bitcoin bro, look it traded at 10k on gdax for a second yesterday"   &lt;&lt; edit: you guys get what irony is right?

@_date: 2017-12-12 13:31:50
I get the block size argument and fees, but BCH is basically an older version of Bitcoin with bigger block size, if you want this why not use Litecoin? And lightning network should solve those issues with Bitcoin, you're investing in the future monetary system when buying Bitcoin. Who's going to accept your BCH atm? People just started to hear about Bitcoin, good luck trying to explain to local business "dude this is a bitcoin fork with lower transaction costs, it's the real bitcoin, trust me". 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:20:34
He's not dumb, his fakecoin is trading at 3k, he made a ton of money from this shitstorm. He's misinformed like his devs and his followers, yes, but dumb, I don't think so.

Internet was also a bubble in the market, how much are Apple and Amazon trading today for?

You think the dude who scammed you 2 years ago will see this and send you your bitcoin back? Do you also believe in Santa?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:01:08
Omg Verto, is that you? Such a scammer, you owe me 20btc from 2012, how many more did you scam with your vape stuff? Unbelievable.. i'll be expecting those btc by the end of the day. 17rD4xgfEZPWrxancq7muZT5QGZwYCdScz

Bitcoin is actually doing pretty well compared to ETH BCH LTC etc. (who dropped a lot more) Look at all the other coins, or sell me your stuff at 10k :D I'll be there waiting with my buy order.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:25:50
Sup bro, are you still up to take for that 10k offer? I had to buy at 11-12k since my buy orders didn't trigger at 10 :(
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:55:56
Sell all of it and buy back at 20k. Sell low &gt; buy high investing strategy ;) (if you're actually high during the 20k purchase you get extra investhor points)
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:51:48
It's really Verto, I talked with him privately he agreed to send me my bitcoin back, but he wants to do it through a Nigerian prince with 1btc deposit to establish trust.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:28:16
Don't sell yet pls, wait for it to dip to 10k, i got my buy orders in there waiting to be filled.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:37:34
Bitcoin is designed to go up in value due to limited supply. The store of value case alone would put its value already pretty high (to that of gold), if lightening is a success and we see 2nd layer &gt; 3rd layer with transaction fees close to 0 its value is going to skyrocket. This article is based on the analysis of a banker, the very industry that's threatened by crypto mass-adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:22:36
Those posts are starting to get old... be more creative guys. Me for example if bitcoin reaches 50 000$ by the end of the year I will get a tattoo of a bitcoin on my penis, "wanna see my bitcoin?" will have a whole new meaning.

10 years investment are you insane? I want my lambo tomorrow, delivered by a model, and a yacht too, and 5 mansions. btw I've invested 5$ 20mins ago, and i'm at the lambo dealership arguing with the sells guy, he won't give me a huracan for 0.000392 btc wtf, this bitcoin thing is clearly a scam, I have no lambo...
@_date: 2019-03-28 00:09:30
Why would you spend money on stuff you don't need? In order to destroy resources? If people start being smart with their money and only give it to companies that make stuff that lasts, or that is useful it will encourage industries to worry less about "how can we milk those retards for more cash" and to think about "how can we make products that last a long time, are useful and are not destroying our planet in the process?" If btc is growing in price people will think "well, I don't really need the iphone15 since I already have the iphone13 and it's basically the same shit, I should probably invest the cash into a good store of value like real estate or btc".

Exchanges / apps/ mobile banks, all are already here to help out the dummies &amp; secure their assets. You can go into the revolut app and buy bitcoin, plenty of other apps giving users crypto credit cards, etc. It's progressing, just because you don't hear about it on tv doesn't mean that there's no progress, not to mention exchanges already implementing lightning.

So we should censor jokes now? Jokes are offensive when they have a solid base in reality, unfortunately most women have no clue or interest in tech and act like the ones we see in memes, if they weren't then OP would not be so unhappy about it because the joke would not make sense. How people react to humor tells more about the person than it does about the quality of the humor/joke. Try to make a joke about guys in general and see how many guys get offended, probably none; do the reverse and you'll get lynched. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:37:58
You're saying that women aren't buying bitcoin because the community isn't welcoming and inclusive to females? Shouldn't financial gain be enough incentive?
