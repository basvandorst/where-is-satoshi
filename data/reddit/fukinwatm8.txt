Hope posts like this diminish after the start of bitcoin futures
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:10:57
No, futures don’t trade on actual derivative i.e., btc. It is cash settlement.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:10:35
Yeah, sell /s

Have an exit plan at least now

Although this doesn’t answer your question, Forget Coinbase exists
Always go for exchanges like Gemini or Gdax (coinbase’s xchg) for their nominal fees

Come again, what happens when all bitcoins are mined? I missed it

Can you afford to lose 30K?
Is it hodl or for trading?

Re: buying BTC with CC
Transaction fee for bank would be 8% which is too much.
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:04:48
Do you have a backup plan just in case? 
Don’t get me wrong, but taking a $30K loan (instead of buying a small chunk from each paycheck) sounds dangerous to me.
Have you got inspired from the guy who sold his house and bought bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:49:26
Same here
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:49:56
Coinbase charges more. My choice is Gemini.
For wallets, paper or hardware.

As a hot storage, it is useful. The lesser web/desktop dependent, the better, IMO.

Gemini and a trezor
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:46:14
That’s it
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:22:36
Even if you have $30K right now, never invest it in a single commodity. Spread it out. 
Dude, filing bankruptcy? For real? Buy 1 BTC for now and later buy small portion with every paycheck.

Don’t try to time the market. No one knows answer to your question.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:29:55
I waited for it to come down to $5000 when it was at $5500 and after looking at today’s run, finally bought at $5960. 
Hence the mantra “don’t try to time the market”
