Can you help me understanding it, or give me some articles? I am not that profound in the swiss banking system and the consequences it would have on a larger scale economic view?

Also it seems it got more active over the last week. Atleast more People are online. And this sub gained around 6500 subscribers over the last 7 days according to my numbers. I would love to see how OP gets his numbers, or how he gets the number of actual new people subscribing, excluding returning people.

I think I get the gist of it, thank you.

I always thougt that short/longs are always symmetrical. So for every short position there should be a long? But in your example this does not have to be the case, right? Do I switch something up there or is your example the buyer of the coin the long position?
Thinking about it, you need someone to bet against it so the person who takes the bet automatically takes a 'passive' long? So there could be a timeline where mr. Gates wants to short but there are not enough people to bet against it?

I can only imagine how all those ups and downs feel like if you have a huge stack. I know early boys might be rich but it also hurts to be not as rich as you once were, or could have been.

Especially really small ones like, .1or smaller?
In germany there is a famous tvshow where people sell heirlooms and if its some sort of trinket with small diamonds they mostly get ignored by the expert. The gold amount is always dominant.

Don't waste your energy here. He seems a bit lunatic to me. Your points are reasonable while his are ideological. I heard your side so many times and no matter what pitpay is a step towards adoption.

What makes you say this? Twitter seems to be one of the least moderated social media platforms to me.

Pretty sure this post, as it currently is, is against reddit TOS.

I am not really into mining, but why would the price dip if jihan would withdraw hashing power? Is it because you can sell one btc at a lower price and still make profit? So the selling pressure is rising?

Seems to be that those people are a majority here..

I do believe California is the place to be for start ups, but i can't really think of one right off the top of my head?
Probably because im not located in the US.

Also why has it to be a ETF in this case and not a ETC? Everything in the top 10 mcap follows BTC anyways?
