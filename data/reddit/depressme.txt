I think the scary thing is simply trusting any 3rd party with your btc, but from the companies I have checked out, I do like coinkite.

 "How do I even buy bitcoins?" type comments have been coming out of the woodwork this past week.

Based on the downvotes, we obviously have some alex jones pole smokers hangin round here.

The only mistake would be selling them back now at a loss. Stay in the game instead! 
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:28:51
What do you think about coinkite? Would you be comfortable storing coins there?
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:43:28
Be cautious going into tin foil hat mode.

Nope, 'twas the tits.

3 years to reach 21m coins? Obviously you don't understand Bitcoin. The mining difficulty curve will adjust to ensure that no matter the total hash power of the network, the coins will not be entirely mined until around the year 2140. A far cry from 3 years. Take some time to grasp the concept you are adamantly arguing against before letting your mind spin it's own wheels about nonsense.
The truth is many of your arguments are just nonsense that has been regurgitated around here, such as the 'tulip' story. Give me a break..... Tulips never had a chance to revolutionize an industry or change the world in any profound way.

This newfangled device is just too much for me to comprehend.  
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:44:56
It's pretty tough to explain to older generations IMO. I tried explaining it to my dad and he wrote it off as a "get rich quick" scam. My parents couldn't understand "what it was for". A lot of people really have trouble grasping the idea of what a currency is, and old people often tend to have many internal biases about how the world works.

Satoshi is always "just chillin"
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:36:02
Why do you think that a currency will take away the problems of the capitalist system? The aim of bitcoin isn't to take down or alter capitalism. 1%ers are a total result of capitalism and not a currency. BTC wasn't created to "make it more fair", and it doesn't really affect the distribution of wealth much at all.
BTC has a lot of speculators right now trying to get rich. But it's really just a currency, designed to be unregulated, not pegged to another currency, more anonymous, convenient, etc. It also allows people to separate themselves from banks and other financial institutions. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:05:21
I'm 30 and I haven't successfully explained bitcoin to a single person older than 45. They just don't get it.

You seem to be frustrated by your own lack of understanding of economics. What do you think dictates price?

@_date: 2013-11-19 00:22:26
Consider yourself a rare exception, and I appreciate that you're out there. Spread the word to your peers, they just don't get it. The most typical response I get is that Bitcoin is "some kind of get-rich-quick scam." Then when I tell them it's a currency they just look at me blankly.
