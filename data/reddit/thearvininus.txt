What subreddit do you think you're in?

Good estimate but it relies on the assumption that off chain accounts each have bitcoin stored in unique addresses.  If you could get the number of accounts at circle, coinbase, counterparty and bit pay has then it would be a better upper limit.

How is this even a little bit related to Bitcoin.  Is just upvoting things that are against people who disagree with If Gavin got a parking fine? That also okay?
@_date: 2017-02-11 03:14:45
Bitcoin is a network effect.  Networks effects work because the utility of the network increases as participants join.  It's not a network of there is never any interaction between participants.
 How could you possibly think buying a virtual token that just sits there with no other use will survive.  I might just as well buy one of the other tokens.  No difference.
Bitcoin is the most valuable because it's the most widely used.

This was really good.  I don't know why people hate Ver.  He's clearly on the front lines of bitcoin in practice, and is seeing the issues users are having.  People saying he's an altcoin pumper are playing color politics.
Johnny was great.  Very sharp and articulate.  
I think there is something interesting highlighted by this discussion.  Bitcoin will do really well if we can get past the short term (~2 years).  If we do then we will have people like Johnny and Ver working in the same direction.

That's pretty disingenuous.  2MB was the mega compromise to get some movement on the issue before we started getting backlog issues.
@_date: 2016-03-23 02:21:40
I'm glad that you pointed out your lack of bias.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:01:34
Care to edit your response here?
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:01:59
I post on r/btc
@_date: 2016-03-23 06:36:14
What about head first mining?
@_date: 2017-02-27 07:42:20
I don't understand how someone like Vayz can claim to be part of the bitcoin space, and yet had to research XThin and Compact blocks for this debate.
I would have preferred someone who knew what they where talking about.
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:22:13
I feel that I need to point this out because noone else is,  the bug was discovered after it was fixed.  It's quite hard to listen to your train of thought regarding "nonchalant developers" when this is your evidence in this case. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 07:32:54
But on a  1 to 10 scale tho...
@_date: 2017-01-14 05:41:11
Could you give some of the history on counterparty and it's exile? It sounds interesting.
@_date: 2017-01-24 01:22:03
Regarding your edit.  Could you explain how increasing the blocksize necessitates a forever increasing supply of bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-01-14 05:44:34
Oh, people are right.  You are a troll...
@_date: 2017-01-14 05:38:19
I think he has said before that the IDEA is out of the box and that once it's out, it cannot be put back in.  
There is nothing in the free market of currencies that says Bitcoin "is too important to fail or die".
@_date: 2016-06-13 12:36:21
So in the same sentence you say people idiots for thinking a different name is a scam and that people shouldn't use division because of their fragile state of mind.
@_date: 2017-01-29 15:49:48
You're clearly looking at the wrong graph man.  I count this as the third spike up to 35%.
Look at the 10k history.  Not the 2k history like it seems you have done.
@_date: 2017-01-29 15:41:36
To be honest.  I'm glad there are people posting basic statistics like this.  I asked someone on to stop doing this kind of thing when they posted a fluctuation of segwit that was as low as 16 percent.
@_date: 2017-01-24 01:09:19
He is infact not suggesting it.  Perhaps if this tweeter had been nice enough to include more context instead of being a shit stirrer...
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:56:59
I think that is quite reasonable though.  
I think you can like a specific language (python for example) but still see the benefit of others (like dirty JavaScript for example)
@_date: 2017-01-19 15:55:26
So what you're saying is... WE NEED A GLORIOUS LEADER!  
Dare I say it?  ELON MUSK!
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:03:31
I don't understand how the link is to a twitter post of a link.
@_date: 2017-01-13 11:03:51
This list is more thorough it seems to me, but is missing future intentions of implementing segwit.
Some googling (in-exhaustive) says that antpool is not upgrading without a hard fork?  
I wish someone would curate a list of press releases like this to augment some of our stats. :/
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:05:34
This is what a consumer facing company says man.  This doesn't dismiss BTC at all.
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:49:06
It depends on who is in the web of trust.
@_date: 2017-01-18 23:59:14
That's why I'm excited about teechan.
@_date: 2017-01-13 16:08:53
It would be nice if the miners where to let us know that they are waiting for libraries to catch up before signalling.  Thus saving us from having to guess their intentions.
@_date: 2017-01-13 11:16:40
I was 100% sure it was parody.
@_date: 2017-01-14 05:34:19
You need to be careful of tribal mentality man.  You see it in the other side but you cannot see it in yourself.  The guy you are replying to is pointing out what really matters and you're just doubling down in tribalism. SAD!
@_date: 2016-12-15 23:32:29
So, now that we know thats how you feel. How do you know that BU is able to get money from people (without people donating voluntarily)? 
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:32:15
I think you should atleast explicitly state why kicking the can down the road could be bad.
Negatives of big blocks: if we kick the can down the road then there is less incentive to scale properly. (Nicessity is the mother of invention)
Negatives of small blocks: the point OP is making.  People will have a bad first experience of using bitcoin.  (Don't let perfect be the enemy of good)
@_date: 2017-01-19 15:56:48
I think you're oversimplifying this situation we are in mate. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 01:11:38
Everyone just wants to win the argument :/
@_date: 2016-11-21 00:44:27
He has said he supports segwit for transaction malleability from the very beginning.
He has supported an increase in block size from the beginning.
@_date: 2016-11-25 01:01:37
I guess posting ethereum news is allowed if it's negative.
"Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies."
@_date: 2016-12-15 00:37:25
It's interesting how you heard that part completely differently to me.
Ver is asked a question about which parties are blocking segwit.
Ver gives multiple possible reasons: one of which is that the people who have been sitting on the fence about segwit look at the suppression of open discussion and think: "hmm, if segwit is so good, why can't their arguments stand on their own?".  He also hopes that everyone will agree that suppression of dissent not good for healthy open discussion.
The counter argument to this was that Ver has his own channels to get these message out.  
This completely misses the point.  And you completely miss the point.
@_date: 2016-11-20 07:25:53
+1 for segwit
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:41:29
That's actually a very good idea.  I like it.
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:00:40
How about this.  Having a geographically distributed network is possible even if average speeds for the region is lower than "required".  
Their criticism of the metric mentioned is valid because it's a poor metric.  He should atleast have included the standard deviations or maybe quantiles.
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:04:56
I live in Australia and moving suburbs means an order of magnitude difference in internet (measured) speed.  Your post is bad because you chose a misleading statistical measure.  
Even having 10% of a country being able to support a certain speed means millions of possible nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:57:04
How do you incentivise nodes?
@_date: 2017-05-14 02:51:44
You wouldn't want to be accused of hating Bitcoin now would you?
@_date: 2015-02-16 12:31:47
I'm just gonna go ahead and say this was a bunch of rambling.
If what you said was true you would expect things to cost the same in all countries.
