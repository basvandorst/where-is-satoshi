But op was talking about Andreas and the woman..  well...I guess he was talking shit then.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:33:41
How do you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:47:10
Who? Andreas?

The number of blocks won't be affected, it's the block reward to the miner that will be cut in half.

That is strange, even in Germany the word dissertation is only used for a PhD and the word thesis is used for bachelor and master degrees.

While Luke rambles on and on about 300kb blocks being too big? 2x is not coming with core EVER, they have shown that over the last years. It's really sad actually.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:36:04
Blocks are still at roughly 1mb. Segwit does not have any impact yet. I am losing trust in your statements.

I agree with the hockey stick theory, but the thing is that 2x can facilitate twice the amount of transactions. So if the spammers hover just under the steep part of the stick, fees will be the same as today because people are obviously willing to pay them. They are paying them right now as the spammers so the same. So the price per transaction is the same with 2x, but the amount the spammer has to pay doubles, which makes Bitcoin more resilient. I agree that it's not a long term solution, but LN is still years away and we need to make Bitcoin usable right now, because currently it isn't.

Because there is not a lot of reason to believe he is dead... Or is there?
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:42:20
2x will make that much more expensive, which is good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:07:08
It is because most wallets don't support segwit yet. Have you sent a segwit tension yet? Have you received one?
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:12:37
You are changing the subject now, so I guess you accept the reasoning about 2x being good for Bitcoin. Great!
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:31:13
Fuck him for wanting to use Bitcoin as money, right?

These articles on btc taxation in Germany are so wrong. They state that if you buy something for BTC in Germany it's not a taxable event. But in reality it is because you are realizing potential gains. 
Source: live in Germany, pay taxes on BTC stuff with advice from accountant who specializes in crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-02 02:55:29
That's right. If you buy or sell crypto you don't have to pay VAT on these purchases. You still have to pay VAT if you buy goods with crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-08 09:37:42
You think he will keep them?
@_date: 2018-03-02 03:48:05
Are you serious?
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:52:27
Your arguments ended all the way up there, so don't take your shirt off...
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:37:34
I'm wondering if it's a coincidence that I think about stupid shit while reading your excuses. Get it? I am implying that you are saying stupid shit, while using the same sentence structure you are using. But you say that you are just wondering without implying anything (which is bullshit). 
But since that is your argument, one could say that I am just wondering too about the shit and you... Just a coincidence...
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:32:53
Well it's your job, so if you didn't do it, you have a problem now.
@_date: 2018-03-02 05:33:06
Just zoom out on the graph and you will see why that is a stupid idea. Not much has changed since the last year except some more batching by exchanges and only 30% segwit. Fees will be back.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:44:04
As if he would ever leave freedom land
@_date: 2018-07-01 07:43:01
That's just not true.
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:43:58
So you said nothing? How convenient.
