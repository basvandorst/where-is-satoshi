@_date: 2018-01-29 22:42:17
Think of it from a different angle like, 1 BTC = 1 million, 100.ooo shits, 10.000 cents , 1.000 name,  100 name, 10 name, 1name
It’s like the reverse, but from 1 to 0.1 to 0.001 to 0.0001 to 0.k10 to 0.k100 to 0.million to 0. ... just put more 0 behind the . (comma) Not in front of it. No?

Hahha that’s funny. These brainwashed ppl using our abbreviation of BTC talking about our (their) coin. Go over there and drop the same question :) 
„Why you now talking about bitcoin when you made it a BTrash ( Bitcoin Cash) forum? Instant hate guaranteed Hahha. I‘d love trolling them. If you don’t, do it i will. Don’t give a shit about up or downvotes (not even sure what they are good for other than feelings). :)  just let me know

Understandable business practice. Once LN is in the few problem should be solved however the price fluctuation problem stays. Who constantly wants to adjust BTC prices for thousands of games?

I found it funny clever but also dark, conflicted �� 
Edit: spelling 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:53:55
The opposite of inflation, deflation. Plus there is only 21 mio BTC ever. So the more ppl want it the higher the price will be. It’s a fixed supply.

@_date: 2017-12-05 00:20:29
Yes but only if you buy back at a lower price than you sold for. You want more bitcoin so you have to buy „low“ and sell higher than you bought for.
Then you want to buy back at lower price you sold for. Anyway, if you have to ask that question my advise to you is to hodl.

Dude, calculate your ROI (return of investments) google how to calculate it if you don’t know already. The mining  ascii machines you are talking about cost big money, same as graphic cards, yes HIGH END CARDSSSSS (plural). 
And getting “free” electricity from your mom’s is not free. In that case it probably won’t be worthwhile. 
Give more details to get better help here.

Not even fully dipping yet. Hodl
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:27:15
I want it to happen too, only challenge I see is the shift to the whole fintech system. How would Bill Gates shift his fortune to BTC? There is not enough BTC for him at the current price... and he is only 0.whatever % of the richest. So yes I get your point the price of BTC needs to be way higher so rich fucks can stay rich. But then there is Hodl ✌��too... 
We only can wait and see what happens, nothing else  to it. Ahh man i wish I could foresee the future, not for personal gains (I’d NOT have the means to jump on board now) just for fun and out of curiosity.

Okay, just saying that it could change. Will it? We will have to see. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:43:15
It might drops significantly lower that the usual 10-15% dips before going slowly back up again. Maybe 50-60%? In that case keep your wallet ready. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:35:47
True but that does not mean that fiat is backed by anything or is a value producing asset. It’s a believe system and if a shift happens well so be it. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:14:40
Hey, you can import your private keys into Coinomi (app on Android). Tell me if you need more help.

Okay, let’s solve that together Reddit! 
Level 1: at the buttom of purple cube (only one move)
Level 2: you have to walk the one dot across until there is one purple dot left.
Move the row with 3 dots out of the rest of the yellow circle dots. Put them together outside and move back in. 
Level 3: move a purple and light Blue Cube. 2
Level 4: move diagonal only two lines needed to move, don’t jump around over the game board too much 
Level 5: move the purple cubes one up. Move the yellow one cube right, move purple cubes back.
Level 6: on it...
Will edit along the way.
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:35:47
You can do that but keep in mind that your FIAT is in that exchange then too. So you might need to buy some altcoin (as the BTC there is sells for more) , transfer it back to the original exchange where you buy cheap BTC, shift cash or altcoin for bitcoin again or fiat and then bitcoin again. Do your math before to see if the fees would eat your profit. Or just HODL, up to you.

I thought about the same but then told myself ... Nope, don’t play with money that is not yours. You will either fuck somebody over or end up like in a movie being chased by a dept collector. In Bitcoins case there is a lot FUD. Rather buy small amounts every fixed day once a week (law of average) and then they are yours. You don’t invest something you don’t have or can afford to lose. Looks like you are looking for security nobody can offer you here. Anyway in the end it’s all on you. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:29:04
So wie es mein Vorgänger sagt. Ist nur eine Handelsbörse. Bei Fragen sag einfach Bescheid. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:31:46
You always lose if you buy high and sell low like with any other thing. And you don’t invest something you can’t afford to lose. It was just not smart decisions but blaming the asset for it is like blaming a game for you being bad at it. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:40:09
Name of the app?

I’d suggest a wallet where you can set your own fees (electrum?). They will maybe take a bit longer but will do the job, it’s a gift after all :). Last time I transferred some (not concerned with speed for now ) and had them in a day! Hope this helps. Have a nice holiday!

Bitcoin grew in price so did the other. Meaning you roughly would have gotten the same. Just saying. You might would have made a few more Satoshi with it but not something significant. Obviously it depends on how much you hodl. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:55:47

More accurately the Fiat price of Crypto at the moment. Or even the market with too many ICOs. It’s like the internet Wild Wild West. But it’s great to see that the technology finally finds its way into the world.

If you consider the Fork in August/September that gave you BTC Cash and you sold the Bitcoin Cash again for BTC then the BTC you have now even got cheaper in price or your initial original investment. :)

Money in a bank is not even yours to begin with. Don’t be sad or angry search for alternative solutions. Necessity is the mother of invention and there is a lot of services out there already that don’t require fiat.
