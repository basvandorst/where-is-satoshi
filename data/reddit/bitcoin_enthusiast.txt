Agreed, except the Australian economists who are pro-freedom and very smart.
@_date: 2016-09-14 19:48:08
What is BitPesa going to do with all those bit-coins, and where do they get the local currency to pay to the donatary?
@_date: 2016-09-02 01:03:34
And then block the "allowed" ads
@_date: 2016-09-09 16:06:39
So for every SMS sent via your service you log the IP of the sender in case it turns out the SMS was used for something illegal?
@_date: 2016-09-02 19:50:26
I'm going to write in Ron Pual
@_date: 2016-09-14 19:57:32
Is this some kind of Bible game?
@_date: 2016-09-17 22:26:31
Sounds like BitPesa is heavily subsidizing you then, eating the costs themselves. Good for you, put it to good use.
@_date: 2016-09-11 12:11:41


You sound like a statist!
@_date: 2016-09-19 02:15:08
Go to a university and ask a few (try the ones not wearing fedoras). I dare you.
@_date: 2016-09-11 14:32:38
Like how can you even be anti-freedom? I don't get it. It's not  the American way.
@_date: 2016-09-10 20:25:00
That can't be right, Hitler was Austrian and he was a statist.
@_date: 2016-09-18 16:19:28
Yes, most computer science researchers around the world for example.
@_date: 2016-09-11 12:15:08
But what about men with guns?
@_date: 2016-09-11 06:57:22
Except for the fact that for some reason they sell for much less! Very mysterious.
@_date: 2016-09-14 20:08:03
Seems like you somehow forgot the number one failure, MtGox.
@_date: 2016-09-02 19:39:02
You should try @_date: 2016-09-12 15:31:06
So where should you look?
@_date: 2016-09-15 09:25:19
Not sure if this is a good name then, to the average consumer it sounds like some kind of Christian Harry Potter thing.
@_date: 2016-09-15 22:34:26
I think they use coins.
@_date: 2016-09-16 19:08:57
I guess you don't actually have an explanation on how bit-coin would help you to avoid fees and costs then? Can't say I'm surprised.
@_date: 2016-09-19 14:13:55
I learned about Ether-Coins and scales fell from my eyes!


Oh wow, this exactly what I mean. What's that, an expert opinion? Imma disregard it and call it FUD because I'm a very smart redditor and I've even read The White Paper
@_date: 2016-09-11 14:46:24
Oh wow
@_date: 2016-09-12 15:15:43


Using debit cards I think
@_date: 2016-09-17 09:55:51
What might be an example of a legal use case for this software?
@_date: 2016-09-14 10:16:41
You would get more because there would be no USD conversion fees.
@_date: 2016-09-17 10:07:29
What would be the point? You can already buy legal stuff anonymously enough over the internet using just normal money and your browser. Anybody with half a brain sees immediately that this system is only useful to people trading in illegal things.
@_date: 2016-09-10 20:55:39
You should post your bit-coin address and ask for tips, everybody loves tipping
@_date: 2016-09-14 10:45:04
Cars have licence plates you know.
@_date: 2016-09-02 15:16:58
Maybe the government threatened to lock them in a cage
@_date: 2016-09-11 20:55:27
Agreed. I think Satoshi is the greatest Australian economist of all time!
@_date: 2016-09-11 12:10:02


Whenever someone uses one of those words I just assume they're a statist and quickly put fingers in my ears. This way they can't brainwash me like they have brainwashed the masses.
@_date: 2016-09-19 10:45:51
When computer scientists point out that bitcoin does not scale and suffers from serious systemic vulnerabilities, put fingers in your ears and try to ignore them.
@_date: 2016-09-09 16:24:38
I see you also can tie every bitcoin payment your customers make to their IP and the SMS number they receive. Very prudent!
@_date: 2016-09-18 16:07:42
Actualmoney goes in, SFYL comes out.
@_date: 2016-09-14 19:59:49
Can you quantify that statement? How much are the USD/BTC/local currency conversion costs, and how much are the costs of the cheapest non-bitcoin alternative?
@_date: 2016-09-15 09:45:26
Why would I use a credit card to buy something from a vending machine when debit cards exist?
@_date: 2016-09-17 09:54:19
I don't understand why the press always fixates on drugs. There's also weapons, cp and scams.
@_date: 2016-09-14 10:34:25


Deciding the conclusions of your thesis before even starting it is a great way to avoid being hoodwinked by criminal statist professors and their fake economics. You need to stay strong and not let "data", "facts" or "research" get in the way!
@_date: 2016-09-09 15:34:24
But I don't want to be fined $185 million
@_date: 2016-09-15 09:21:51
Hmm yes a company that only exists to facilitate the buying and selling of bit-coins somehow isn't a bit-coin project.
@_date: 2016-09-15 09:49:06
That's why the app store purchases can be aggregated on top of your monthly phone bill.
@_date: 2016-09-15 09:19:01
He cashed out already.
@_date: 2016-09-18 15:55:17
Don't waste your time on worthless mediation services. Report them to the police for fraud.
@_date: 2016-09-14 15:30:15
So how do you convert bit-coins to the locally accepted money?
@_date: 2016-09-10 10:14:52
My uncle who works for Nintendo told me they'll release the Lightning Network next year.
@_date: 2016-09-10 09:58:06
Are you referring to...... *statists*???
@_date: 2016-09-10 10:27:30
The Australian economists who are the only real economists because they're not statists don't believe in empirical methods or data.
@_date: 2016-09-19 14:01:52
All the mining is performed by three operators in China.
@_date: 2016-09-11 17:57:24
Oh I think I get it, once that happens the men with guns will be working for *us*. Say no more ;)
@_date: 2016-09-10 20:46:53
IOUs are just as good as money
