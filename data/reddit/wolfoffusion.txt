On what volume? It was de-listed from all exchanges, so price means nothing today.
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:36:10


Oh yes, there is quite a bit of manipulation for sure...
However, what I would suggest is that you not "get out" completely, but maybe take a break from the daily volatility of Bitcoin. Trust me, if you were around in 2014, it also would have driven you crazy because there was even *more* manipulation due to less liquidity, plus the added stress of hacks like Mt. Gox and bad sentiment seemingly destroying Bitcoin on a daily basis... to the point where BTC looked like it *could* go to zero. And I mean actually going to *zero*... Not just hanging onto 6k, like it is today. A lot people who did well 2017 actually walked away in 2014 and forgot about their Bitcoin... until the price spiked. 
So yeah, come back in a couple of years... and I think you will be shocked at the level of growth by then. Not only will Bitcoin still be around (imo), but I think the level of advancements in the crypto-currency space will pleasantly surprise you. 
People are actually working hard to improve the technology, while we are mostly concentrating on the price.

@_date: 2018-08-09 20:25:02
TBH, I'm not so worried about how many people have "heard" of the Bitcoin name, typically in passing... I'm more concerned about how many people know how to acquire and store it (safely), which is still a relatively small number of people today. In the U.S, only 5% of people surveyed have ever gone through the process of purchasing Bitcoin.
If Bitcoin approaches anything even remotely close to 100k in the near future, there will be a surge in *acquisition* like we've never seen before, which is what I'm waiting to see.

Credibility and integrity are important to me, especially when someone is presenting his/herself (and opinion) as being part of a larger group that they are clearly not a part of.
For example, if someone started their argument with, "As an east Asian, I don't find this offensive because etc. etc...." knowing full well that they are Hispanic, why would I even entertain such a misrepresentation of the truth? The answer is, I wouldn't.

To be honest, many of the early adopters are still in it... It may not seem like it, because we are hyper-focused on today's price compared to 7 months ago, but a lot of people around today were around during the crash of 2014.
To say that the early days of blockchain are over, when the majority of the "non-techie" world have absolutely no clue what a blockchain is or how to obtain crypto, is very short-sighted imo.

Generally speaking, **ETFs** are considered an asset, while **ETNs** are considered a debt.
Price of an **ETF** = Value of underlying investments + trading costs to create/redeem shares.
Price of an **ETN** = Value of underlying index + default risk + supply of shares.
**ETNs** are relatively unknown to many retail investors, as they make up a small portion of the overall ETF/ETN market.
ETFs = 90% to 91% marketshare
ETN = 9% to 10% marketshare
Consider all of that... and then consider the fact that this "ETN" is Swedish-back, not U.S. backed (which makes a difference to the many investors who are still awaiting an SEC approved ETF) and along with that, must be traded on a foreign stock exchange, with the likelihood of a premium being attached to the price... and I can tell you with much confidence that Wall Street will not adopt this product.
Sorry, but this is not the ETF solution you are looking for.
@_date: 2018-08-15 09:14:52
Agreed. EOY 2018 is pushing it, and I could see another delay easily coming our way.

Aliens may have taken over Google and corrupted the conversion tool data that day as well... but the more likely scenario is that he or she quickly photoshopped to change a digit because they were really close, which has been done pretty often on this sub for "meme value" / internet points.

True, there is a danger point in USD value... but this assumes that miners will simply walk out and not be replaced by more efficient mining as the difficulty also drops. There is a lot of incentive to keep on mining BTC today (even as the price decreases) due to the historical price movement.
I wouldn't underestimate how far the mining population is willing to go to stay profitable and continue to see BTC thrive in the future. They've been through huge price drops before.

Well, that's a bit of a tricky question.
IMO, at that price, it is likely that something went wrong (i.e., the security of the network was breached), and in that case, I'd be very concerned. I personally do not see the price going that low without a significant event occurring... so when you say something is clearly wrong, it's an actual possibility that something *is* indeed wrong in that scenario.
However, if the network remained secure and bad actors had not infiltrated the core code in any real capacity, then I'd definitely continue to support the project without worry, long term.

Price "spiked" to 14k a few months ago, just based on the sentiment that it was the beginning of a bull market (and that BAKKT was good for Bitcoin). It is quite clear that the price of BTC  can still move drastically based on sentiment alone, even without the crazy levels of FOMO we saw back in 2017.
In other words, if people think the halving event will push the price over the ATH, then there is a good possibility that it will, considering all the attention that will be on BTC around that time.
@_date: 2019-03-05 06:41:16
Buying $1k at $1.00 would be quite a difference as well... but that's assuming you'd still be a "buyer" at that price range, which isn't a complete given. Many people don't buy until the price has tripled or quadrupled from the previous ATH, which we witnessed first hand in 2017.

People think anything that pumps the price is good for Bitcoin... but this is only a moon-boy way of thinking.

Significant to the market? Yes. Significant to my wallet? No.
Higher price usually indicates higher demand for a dis-inflationary currency... so yes, I'd assume more people would be holding &amp; feeling the effect / shock of a % drop at a higher valuation.
I guess this also leads into the idea that such a % drop becomes harder to manufacture as the marketcap grows and it requires more &amp; more people to be in agreement in order to swing the price... Not just a few fat wallets, like today.
@_date: 2019-08-17 20:13:05

@_date: 2019-08-14 18:18:33
Yeah... I mean, whether it drops from $1.00 to $0.60 or $100,000 to $60,000... the actual losses are exactly the same for every holder.
@_date: 2019-08-16 16:51:57
That's fair... 7k might be pushing it. 
I'd say 8k would still be a healthy amount of "fear," but we obviously wouldn't want to hang around that range for too long. Historically, we've seen retracements back to the 200 day during a bull market, but never closing below it. Percentage-wise, I don't know the numbers off the top of my head, but I also think we moved up a bit faster than we *should* have tbh... but I guess that's crypto.
@_date: 2019-08-16 17:08:59
Ah... and with BAKKT now confirmed, we can pretty much forget about returning to 8k - 9k imo

Because you are short-sighted. 
As the marketcap continues to grow, those 2k a day drops have less of an effect on long &amp; short term holders. Nobody expected a $1,000, let alone a $100,000,000,000 MC years ago, so a Multi Trillion dollar marketcap is certainly within the realm of possibility (once again, if you are not short-sighted). 
Think beyond today's numbers and then your mind will open up a bit here.
@_date: 2019-08-16 16:41:50


Not really. You are applying traditional finance rules to an immature, speculative asset. A retracement to the 8k range would be just fine, considering the speed at which the price spiked (which itself was unnatural, to some degree). A pull-back to the 200 day is reasonable in a multi-year crypto bull market.
@_date: 2019-08-16 16:18:36
To be honest, I would love some 7k to 8k BTC... It would be a healthy correction for the market, but there is way too much support at those price levels at the moment.

Retail FOMO is nothing compared to Institutional FOMO...

Shortly later, we started hearing reports that institutions like Fidelity, Nasdaq, Greyscale, etc. were accumulating all of these people's coins at the bottom, while they were being sold for cheap.  SMH. ��

People who have had their funds "held hostage" on an exchange for weeks (or even months) during the last bull run, definitely care...

Not necessarily. 
There are also psychological ceilings (called "big evens") where you'll often find the tops of a hype cycle. There is a reason BTC basically topped out at around 20K rather than some random number like 13,250. Same with the previous / old cycle where BTC topped out at 1k before crashing. A lot of people jumped out of BTC at 10k, thinking it was all over as well... but it quickly became apparent that it wasn't done yet.

Sorry, but to conclude that a 15% difference in BTC is "safe" on one end, while extremely risky at the other, is nothing more than buffoonery logic. A smart "fund manager" (not sure why this is even being mentioned in this area... but okay) would never make such an arbitrary call or say "go all in" at x-price -- because that's definitely the bottom or your one-shot entry point. This is silly advice / bad strategy, imo.
After an 80% decline, it would make way more sense to suggest that someone ease into the market by investing in increments and setting realistic, tangible goals towards their buy in price... Not perpetually waiting for a set price and proclaiming it to be a safe bet when (or better yet, if) it even gets there. Many people did this with BTC when it fell 80+% to $200 -- They were waiting for the "big even" entry point of $100. Guess what? They're *still* waiting.
That is the Nostradamus investment strategy of timing the market; which fails very often.

We are not talking about a "swing" in price... We are talking about a price that existed vs a price that didn't today, and whether the difference in value is drastic enough to warrant the negative perception.
There is no way you can argue that a 15% difference is the difference between risk and safety, since you'd have no way of knowing if that price will ever be reached, let alone if it's a safe entry point.
That is called trying to time the market.

Well, for starters... a treasure trove of Personal Data on more than 2 Billion people, including a consistently up-to-date national identification database, complete with photos, political interests, shopping habits, travel destinations, music &amp; film interest, and any other conceivable form of personal interests a person may have...
...and to top it off, all of this information is volunteered by its users for free, so there is little investigative or survey costs. Sorry to say, but that stuff is invaluable information to anyone involved in business or marketing, or any government entities that may be interested.

Hey brother, no sense in crying over spilt milk... You had to do what you had to do. 
Sometimes life throws you a curve ball, but you are still a relatively early adopter of crypto and there will be plenty of price dips from here on out. When BTC is 100k, you won't even be worrying about that old car.
And yes, I firmly believe it will hit the 100k mark at some point in the future.

Many people claim that Warren Buffett only brings up Bitcoin because the media keeps asking him about it... but I think it's a lot deeper than that. It's becoming very clear that these overpaid bank-shills are fearful of a potential power shift happening if they allow regular people to control their own money; something they have gotten used to controlling (and *mismanaging*) on our behalf for centuries.

Anybody who understands what a "store of value" is, more than likely understands that it doesn't have to be stable in order to be considered as such (e.g., the price of gold, historically, has been very volatile... and at one point took over 35 years to start increasing in dollar value in the last century). The reality is that BTC only has to hold its value in the long run -- which is why I stress the value being higher than all previous years and drops, prior to the latest run-up.
I'm sorry if you thought 10 to 11 months was "long term"... but you wouldn't be the first to make that mistake. Maybe you should have arrived sooner?

Impatience is the main reason why people who invested in BTC years ago are still struggling to turn a profit today, even after 10,000% gains since then... A lot of panic selling, bad trades and seemingly clever attempts to increase their stacks overnight, leading to major losses in the long run. 
Patient investors simply held, DCA-ed, and took profits after reaching specific goals -- a method that can take years, not weeks, to see massive gains... but has been lucrative for many in here.

Not that easy... It took *a lot* of manipulation, price suppression tactics, and bank-sponsored FUD.

There may be very little cost (in theory), but there is a huge amount of risk... See Mt Gox.

Maybe, or maybe the other person is exchanging Bitcoin for something that won't be worth anything in 2 years.
(i.e., Venezuelan Bolivars)

But you have to acknowledge, that institutions don't typically put their money on something that they believe will fail or has already reached it's max potential. 
There's no evidence to suggest that it will never bounce back, but there is plenty of evidence to suggest that more growth in the future for BTC is likely.

Uhh, U.S. History says otherwise...
Everything is capable of failing in its infancy stage and stocks were just as vulnerable **pre-regulation**.
What do you think sparked the creation of the antiquated securities laws that we are asked to abide by in the US today? Yes, the collapse of the Stock Market. lol 
All markets need time to mature, including crypto, so people who dismissed it 2 yrs, then 5 yrs, and now 10 yrs into its existence... are foolish, imo.

You can use that in a new phone to restore access. Treat that code with care.

I suspect they matter to millions of people around the world, which is why a single one costs over $3k right now... and if my math is correct, is approx. 3 times what it costs at the beginning of last year.

Don't need "mass adoption" in the way that most people are trying to push the concept; We just need incremental or increasing adoption... BTC's awareness + presence in the world has increased exponentially every year since its inception, yet only a small percent of the population actually own any of it.
Stupid people losing a lot of money on the way up is very natural, imo.

Which goes back to my original statement... Only an idiot would completely dismiss an exponentially growing market after just 10 years of existence. Within that 10 years, the crypto-concurrency market has done exceptionally well... whether *you* want to acknowledge it or not.
Institutions (Nasdaq, NYSE, Fidelity, and regulators like the SEC) have all already acknowledged it.
