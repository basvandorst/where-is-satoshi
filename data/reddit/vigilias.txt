I completely agree, but I would suggest Gresham's law is going to pull all the good money out of Bitfinex and if anything all that will be left is 36% of the newly minted equity tokens which as I understand is their solution.
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:32:18
Yeah, I'm all for arbitration deciding this rather than Bitfinex itself.
@_date: 2016-08-22 14:58:52
I wonder if I could stream a feed of me gambling and accept coinbase bitcoin donations?
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:26:22
I disagree. 36% of someone's 10,000 btc and 36% of someone's 1 btc is a huge difference.
I'm not even sure you're allowed to cover depositor's loses with other depositor's capital.

@_date: 2016-08-06 17:45:46
Taxing depositors savings. I've heard of this before.
@_date: 2016-08-10 04:12:30
Well, zapwallettxes worked initially, but it looks like my wallet is maybe trying to resend the tx, locking up my outputs again.
Any other suggestions other than time?
@_date: 2016-08-10 02:33:22
Is it normal that it rescans the wallet, do you know?

You're suggesting we take the car wreck with us up the highway.
@_date: 2016-08-07 16:05:44
I agree, but that would be the only thing left floating Bitfinex. They're "bad money" now and all the good money is going to fly out the door asafp.

A couple days ago they were trying to tell me that r/bitcoin was trying to manipulate me into buying litecoin. That was pretty much my last straw.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:44:25
Is this real? It seems insane to me that they would risk losing your business for something so trivial, but then again, I guess being your own bank technically is competition, so I'm not sure what to think. If my bank tried this, I've be outty5000 so fast it wouldn't even be funny.

@_date: 2017-12-01 16:26:54


That's not how they do it, they do it by contracting the money supply, not liquidating their assets. They did this in the first place because currency is printable and worthless and assets are not. They have no interest in the currency back as a reserve *they are the reserve.* they want our tangible items. Once they start calling in their loans, and contracting the money supply that's when the depression starts. Unless you have some actual money.

I don't shut up about bitcoin. What's awesome is the more you talk about it, the better you can explain how it works. I don't have everything down, but I understand the blockchain, how nodes work, the benefits of p2p transactions, being your own bank etc etc. I get a little bit confused at some operational stand points, but all in all I know enough to explain it, and when you get stumped on a question (or me anyways) it just motivates one to find the answer and come better prepared for next time.
Last week at the gym I wore my bitcoin tshirt, someone asked about it and soon enough I had a crowd of people all listening and asking questions.
I like bitcoin as a hedge against fiat devaluation, as a store of value that is instantly exchangeable anywhere in the world.

Soooooo as a noob who has a few coins on his computer using the bitcoin core wallet (I think, it's like 50+ Gigajigs) what does this mean for me? Do I have to do anything?
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:56:57
Most crypto enthusiasts and gold bugs want to think that doesn't mean anything, but having a currency backed by a government is actually quite valuable.
@_date: 2018-05-14 23:10:28
I don't know what they used to send the coins, but it definitely wasn't blockchain.
@_date: 2018-05-23 01:20:01
Can you elaborate on what you mean by influencing how crypto is categorized? Let's say they were selling something else, like physical gold, would influencing how gold is categorized allow you to naked sell it? I don't think you could sell "paper" bitcoin and claim you were selling bitcoin without it constituting fraud, but I'm no lawyer. Also, I don't care about being right, I care about the information.
@_date: 2018-05-23 00:23:53
It appears to me that you think banking and fractional reserve banking are the same thing.
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:30:00
I don't think fractional reserve banking has any place in finance. You should not lend out that which you do not own, period.
@_date: 2018-05-07 22:27:53
Bitcoin and blockchain are the same thing. There are copies of bitcoin/blockchain but they are not blockchain.
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:22:36
Banking license or not, Coinbase cannot sell bitcoin they do not have, and they can't use this license to fabricate more bitcoin like they do fiat.

@_date: 2016-06-29 03:19:59
I couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2016-06-15 14:53:07
So, here I am 12 hours later, with 0 confirmations. Is this because I didn't pay a high enough fee, or could there be another problem? 
I'm sending it to a electrum wallet and when I search the transaction ID on Blockchain I get this message : Transaction rejected by our node. Reason: Non-canonical signature: High S Value.
When I check the wallet addy in Blockchain it shows the coins there, just unconfirmed, and I can confirm also that the wallet shows unconfirmed coins.
Is it just a waiting game at this point?

@_date: 2017-08-18 03:08:06
Powerful enough? They could simply make it illegal. We still have to pay our taxes, which will always give their fiat value, so to be honest I don't really see it.
In an abundant society, we would not need to exchange utility because there would be an abundance of utility, therefore none to exchange.

He just doesn't understand the blockchain. That's okay, it's complicated, and when you don't understand it you don't understand it's utility. I think of bitcoin like money+.

It's okay to hold alts, but you need to hold and pay homage to the king : bitcoin. For a couple simple reasons.
1.) It's the original blockchain. So if you like and believe in blockchain technology first and foremost before trying to get rich on exponential gainz by picking the next alt-boss, supporting bitcoin is a no-brainer.
2.) Since bitcoin was the first and has been the industry leader I would suggest if for some unfathomable reason bitcoin went to zero, all others would either precede it, or shortly follow. 
So hold and use alts, but make sure you throw some of daddy bitcoin in there too because it's going to be  for the foreseeable future.

Still he's saying they fractionally reserve the base money and create extra currency on top of that. Like for instance in Canada they alter your promissory note into a negotiable instrument and then lend you the proceeds of the fraudulent conversion. It's mainly done through the mortgage market.

@_date: 2019-01-09 02:04:43
It's even worse.
They work on what's called fractional reserve banking.
So here's what they do. They get your $1000 and because they have that $1000 they're able to lend out 33 to 1. So they lend out $33,000 based on your $1k deposit.
This works because only approx 3% of the bank's monetary base is exposed at any one time. Obviously you'll see liquidity crunches, as well as the opposite where they lend out 100 to 1. There was no limit before the GFC, but after that in one of the bills (which has probably been repealed by now, I don't recall) they decided to play it safe with 3%.
It's actually insane when you think about it, which is how I found out about bitcoin in the first place. I started studying about currencies and money, understanding central banking, money creation and supplies how it integrates with interest rates etc. Just as a hobby for some reason I love learning about money. Once I was well educated I came across bitcoin and thought "If people only knew what I know these would be worth a million dollars over night." And well, here I am.

No, what you're talking about IS the difference between money and currency. Money stores our value, while currency destroys it. It isn't meant to be like this, currency is meant to represent money (be backed by it) but instead it represents debt.
The best part about bitcoin is it's decentralized money. The powers that be can't just double the money supply (like they did in 2008, which I might add, didn't cause 100% inflation because of market rigging etc, which to me, is the opposite of "stability") because they need money for wars. That's the thing about wealth : It can't be created. Currency can, and when people believe that money and currency are the same thing they'll trade their livelihood for it. 
This is what bitcoin was born from. It represents everything important that we've lost : Control of our money supply. There's lots of reading out there, but the fact that you're here itself leads me to believe you're familiar with the Rothschild's &amp; friend's banking dynasty. Bitcoin is the answer to that. People realizing they control their own money by inclusion rather than exclusion.
On the flip side of that coin, if you could biologically tie an organism to the blockchain and it was the most dominate form of money, it would be the absolute perfect taxation system, which kinda gives me a sickly feeling. I dunno. I think for the time being it's the best money we got.

I can't say anything about Bitpay specifically because I don't know anything about them, but if Bitcoin is going to have institutional investments take part, there's going to have to be AML and KYC or funding will never get the green light.

@_date: 2019-09-20 04:36:43
It's going to be gold, crypto and government issued fiat. There will always be government issued fiat while there is a government and they're able to give it value by accepting it exclusively for the settlement of taxes.
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:04:33

It's like this in Canada too.
@_date: 2016-10-28 20:43:22
This is not entirely true. I've had a tx stuck in the mempool for 2+ months and instead of clearing it ended up going through. It ended up tying up a bunch of unspent inputs that were part of the tx. It was super annoying and an aspect of bitcoin that nobody had any information on.

rather than cancelling the trade altogether. It's these shoddy algorithms that I ain't got time for.
@_date: 2015-10-31 01:50:24
So is the txfee also a deflationary aspect of bitcoin? If the minimum amount you can move is ~2700 satoshis, then a satoshi really isn't a divisible unit of bitcoin since it has no practical use?
@_date: 2015-11-14 03:36:14
As if. Canada has zero fractional reserve requirements. Get a bank charter, create infinite money. We're still suckling on the queen's teet. Some of the worst banking laws in the world, touted as the most secure. In Canada's own economic action plan it suggests bail-ins instead of bail-outs in the event of one of the big five going down.

@_date: 2015-10-31 18:17:46
I had a negative issue with them too. They double sold my dogecoins and I was on the hook for the negative dogecoins before I was able to unlock my account. I stopped using them after that.

Um, that is ABSOLUTELY the role of Government. We need to restore the issuance of currency(not money, currency is not money and money is not issued) BACK to Government and recognize it as it's more sacred and conspicuous responsibility. Right now, private interests control the issuance of currency.
@_date: 2016-05-05 19:50:26

A blockchain cannot be corrupted? What do you think a 51% attack does exactly?
@_date: 2015-10-31 02:01:17
If I can send you 1 satoshi for no fee, then there are far more divisible units of bitcoin than if the minimum is 2701. 2699 satoshis by themselves in a wallet are essentially useless.
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:53:06
I'm not into the drama, no. Side a says blah blah side b says blah blah. Nobody is innocent, and nobody knows where either bitcoin or bitcoin cash are headed. I don't see any harm in sprinkling a little bch into the portfolio even if I prefer btc. There's no such thing as a free lunch, I get that I'm missing out on the opportunity to own more btc, but I'm an eggs and baskets type of guy.
@_date: 2015-10-20 02:35:59
And if you think bitcoin can't be privatized just like government, just wait until we have 100mb blocks and no one with the hardware to store the full blockchain.

This is an extremely good question, and likely not worth risking to find out. It was this reason I never moved forward on the Coinbase account I activated.
