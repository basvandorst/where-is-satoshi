Print your QR code from Bittrex or wherever, put it in a keepass database and store it on the cloud. How hard can it be. Even if someone gets "a hold" of this code somehow(which they wont) they will still need your password to steal something.

I am doing this with alts but as for btc it's not possible unless I would buy a car or a house or maybe gold

Nice argument. Please explain "Ryan Gosling knowledge" term

ok. sorry.
It's possible and due to long transaction queues and high fees it stupid to buy for example a coffe for $5 when the fee is $20 and waiting time is 10 hours. For online purchases above certain amounts it's absolutely a good option.

I think Bitcoin is very comparable to Gold. It is expensive to mine, buy and sell. It is a store of value. Since bitcoin is somewhat tethered to alts I believe it is immortal, but at the same time we should allow ourselves to hate on it when it does not perform accordingly to *modern digital standards*.
To oversimplify - I always saw Bitcoin as a next-gen torrent database.. I have a gigabit/second connection that I pay less than $100/month for. I can download the blockchain in minutes(no, I cant! It's completely theoretical!) Still I am waiting MINUTES+ for blockchain confirmations!?!?!? And what kind of shit-protocol allows it to update itself 3 times per second? We need lightning.network connectivity now, or we will look like idiots when this is looked back upon in history. I do not want to compare Bitcoin to BGP or some other "designed-to-be-slow-ass" shit internet protocol that just "waits" for _nothing_. There is no acceptable explanation for something with this market cap/value to be this low quality.
I fucking hate Roger Ver after his ludicrous display, but this is how it happens... If we do not beat him technically... Even if we don't win - we are pushing money in to that fucker's mouth...
Edit: Sorry for pushing all kinds of buttons but this is how it went down in the battle of AC/DC, Betamax, QWERTY/DVORAK, Left/Right traffic.. all kinds of BS. I'm tempeted to mention some kind of war in the middle 20th-century but then I'm afraid I'm out of line... remove the last one - it's just to make you understand what we are doing to ourselves....

Let me blow your minds people.
I am Swedish and I have had some interest in Bitcoin for a while. Having a problem understanding why people really want to use it for everyday or even practical use has taught me some useful insight.
It seems that America is the free country and home of some unprecedented economic liberalism compared to Europe (you even call us Socialist countries like Sweden/Norway etc commies). Let's put this aside and look at banking systems in Sweden and Norway (I am Swedish but I have lived in Norway for almost 3 years now). BTW the relationship between Sweden and Norway can be seen a littlbe bit like the one between US and Canada where Sweden is a bit less socialist and Norway is a bit more socialist and also a smaller country (not the same ratio as US/Canada though - Norway is 'bout half the size of Sweden)
OK, Let's get right to it:
What does it cost me to have a bank account with a credit card? \~$2/mo
What does it cost me to pay with my credit card? Nothing.
What does it cost to withdraw cash from an ATM? Nothing.
How much does it cost to make a bank transfer to pay my bills? Nothing. Also this is also something I can digitally delegate a permission for my ISP or Electrical company to just deduct whatever they want every month and mail me a copy of the invoice. Should there be a problem, it is very easy to investigate the matter and get money back or have it deducted from next months bill. This feature is called "autogiro" and is supported by almost every major company that provides public service.
What does it cost me to make a transfer from my bank account to my friends account? Nothing, and there is no waiting time/delay more than maybe 1-3 minutes unless it's in the night or on a weekend.
What does it cost me to send money from my Swedish bank account to my Norwegian bank account or the other way? Nothing and it takes less than one hour during business hours.
This got me thinking that Americans might be free in their own way, and there are some seemingly strange differences that you don't always know about, but our government does not let our banks abuse us because companies aren't allowed to do whatever they want. This might be a socialist thing but at least I am happy to be able to provide one positive effect from it.

Always happy to hear when people buy Towns, Lamborghinis, SLI-riggs or w/e with cryptoprofits, but this is just amazing! :) There is no price on love! Goodspeed

This video is the first one to make me feel that I'm not going to be in this to make money, but to hold a big piece of history

If we are to use crypto instead of fiat money we need something else than BTC. Of course it will come but is there something even close to it now?
I am investing in litecoin because of its transfer speed, the low fees and new technologies like atomic swap but it still ISNT GOOD ENOUGH SINCE IT ah sorry for
Caps..takes a couple of minutes to complete a transfer which I think wouldn’t be practical in scenarios like buying coffee

Was also about to ask this. Coolest wp ever
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:53:21
According to previous comments here that’s not nessecarily true, but yeah I get your grudge..
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:40:19
OK, thanks for good answer :)
Even though this would go against Einstein’s principle that it’s not a good idea to short BTC

I don’t know very much about this... I guess the withdrawal limits are for people who touch cash money, so does this mean these ppl trade/swap with USDT, or do they just interchange with other cryptos like ETH/LTC?

200BTC either going to Swizerland or spending reddit-time thinking about how to cram both seeds into the same device instead of getting 2 ledgers? Made me lol.
Edit: Also note that Ledger blue is overkill for 200 coins :)

Someone in 2018 is trying to buy his first Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:18:43
Maybe stupid question but... How long time would you need to liquidate 200BTC in the real world? 
Even if you use 2-3 Exchanges at the same time it sounds like a drag logging into 3 exchanges every monday morning trying to maximize your shitty 9000€/week cap (at least that's my limit)

According to coinbase, they hold 98% of their assets cold offline, and up to $250k fiat as well as _all_ crypto-currency is insured
