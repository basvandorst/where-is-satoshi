Are there any charities that directly benefit cancer patients at the VA? My grandfather was on the liver transplant list for about a year and while I was willing and ready to donate my liver for him, the VA wouldn't cover the expense because they don't do living donor transplants. I got a call from my mother yesterday that the cancer has now spread outward from his liver and he only has 6 months left. Wish it would have played out differently but life does its thing.

Annnddd this is why insurance backed digital asset custody, is going to be the only thing that can bring crypto to the masses. Not banks necessarily, but entities that can actually manage cryptocurrencies without losing them or access to them.

So Bitcoin can't really be used to tokenize physical assets?

They also said that those 4,912 Bitcoins translated to 20 million dollars...

Guess I am also retarded. 20 years into life and finally somebody tells me. Oh man I'm sorry, I didn't catch onto your incredible superiority, please forgive me as this is an anonymous social platform and allow me to bow down and worship the very ground that your million dollar shoes happen to walk on.

Almost enlisted, but I am a philosophy major really invested in the morality and ethics of warfare. Hopefully I can make an impact on junior Marines and maybe one day the Marine Corps as a whole.

You probably drive a turbodiesel with a 10 inch lift kit and a 8 inch exhaust tip? If that doesn't say worlds largest penis and most efficient pussy slayer known to mankind, I really don't know what does.

@_date: 2018-03-28 18:22:29
Do you actually believe that?
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:25:17
Okay, thankyou! I couldn't tell if you were exaggerating a bit or very serious.
