Shapeshift unique model represents a minimization of risk for the transacting parties. this attack ironically proves the strength of the model. pls keep up the good work.
remember karma theory applies to the digital world too....

thanks for the effort. 
the only thing missing in the chart is speed  score (e.g. found privatoria great except for the speed the cost of speed was 50%-80% depending on servers. Australia was 50% and Germany was around 80% of the normal broadband speed.)

interesting ... but 
for a non-tech guy what does the 21.co based oppurtunity mean ? if at all ,at this stage of development .
i cant code ( anything beyond dumb walkthroughs/tutorials).

hi i am also from india . Just withdraw your coins to your wallet dont keep it with the exchange  ( i recommend breadwallet if your using iOS )
i have used zebpay with no problems yet. However i think localbitcoins.com is a good option.  Tried unocoin didnt like the support and general feel. 
have been experimenting with p2p ecxhange bitsquare . give it a spin its not custodial in nature . but be sure of the wallet / security etc . Bitsquare assumes  you know your shit
