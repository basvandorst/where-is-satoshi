So you could analyze the past trends for patterns which shows us nothing about the future.

I mean we may have a small sample but from what I've seen I agree with you.

Abra works for this but it is far from the best as fees are high. You can pay with American Express for 'instant' (or nearly) purchases but there is a daily limit of $200 and a monthly limit of $1000. You'll pay $208 for the $200 and I believe the price is marked up slightly.

That's a joke, at least for the last 50 years or more 
@_date: 2018-08-29 01:09:33
An entirely new concept, to be sure.

Wow that is going to take no time at all once the bulls come back. May I ask are you native to kazahkstan or did you move there as part of your plan?
@_date: 2018-08-29 05:17:43
Best of luck to you! Looks like a great set up.
@_date: 2018-05-30 05:39:31
That's a lotta jism

My point was that infrastructure and education are not priorities for spending taxpayer dollars in the United States, and have not been for some time, and listing the ways in which some government agencies have improved those areas really doesn't invalidate that.

Why not just buy Monero with the BTC? Genuinely asking, if someone has a reason.

I doubt the difference is enough to explain the difference in mining capabilities between the US and China. Also, just because there are more regulations in the US does not mean they are followed - instead fines may just be paid. 
@_date: 2019-03-11 04:58:12
It's okay, people that lack critical thinking were bound to be consumed by the media anyways.
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:21:54
Yes because the environment is such a priority to US corporations.

I'm just saying that the mechanic was there for 20+ years and probably deserved a bit more than what he got. No, the owner is not responsible for his death. The mechanic could have seeked medical attention sooner, but didn't want to be stuck with a huge bill. 
The owner was a good guy, but I don't understand the mentality that would lead to him hosting work parties at his mansion while long time employees had bare bones health coverage. 
No he wasn't wrong for it, but I have an issue with the general concept.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:34:09
Half retard checking in - I hope you're right.

I can't imagine that they sell constantly, so I don't think the large scale mining farms are going to care at all. Any commercial miner has already made a substantial investment, and their return was already going to be long term. I don't think a dip is enough to make those type of mining operations (which I imagine make up a majority of the hash rate) close shop.
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:23:43
Only at current prices. I think even modest operations are going to be fine operating at a loss if their outlook is long term. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:31:01
I think there is a bit of nuance to the situation, and obviously generalizing it as "profit is evil" is going too far (at least for this conversation). 
One example I have is a former company I worked for. It had a single location with 10-15 employees and the owner took home half a million a year. Working conditions were fine, but everyone was underpaid for the work they performed (by my perception) and most egregiously so in terms of benefits. 
Health insurance was only offered once it was mandated by law, and even then it was a plan with high premium/high deductible. 
Yes, the owner took all the risk to start the company. Yes, he risked his own capital and likely spent many years underwater until he started turning a profit. However, at this point in time his company was well established and his risk was virtually nil. 
Every employee was integral in making his shop run, and yet he paid the bare minimum and only offered a pittance of benefits once he was required by law. 
So, I think it's fair to say that the owner of the company is entitled to more reward for their risk, but I think my example is grossly disproportionate and not uncommon.
While I was working there one of the mechanics (20+ yeard at the company) had a tumor develop on his foot, but because he couldn't afford the deductible he kept putting off going to the doctor. Eventually he had no choice and they ended up amputating his foot. He died a few months later.
I'm not saying he would have lived with better insurance, but I can't fathom being the owner and letting those events unfold.

Enter: Memes.
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:56:00
Yeah, I understand that too. The mechanic did have skills and could have utilized them in other ways over that time. I agree that he had many opportunities to correct his situation before he was in it.

I think if it really does become adopted as a mainstream currency, then even that number could be low. The general trend seems to be increasing adoption for BTC, but I suppose that could be reversed by a number of things.
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:52:45
I think in the short term (one year or less) it is hard to predict, but in the long term (5+ years) it is a fairly safe bet to think the price will be much higher than now.
@_date: 2019-02-27 10:12:12
Wow, quite the rabbit hole with [this post](
Every time I think that he couldn't possibly be any more of a shit stain I find myself proven wrong.
@_date: 2019-02-27 02:42:28
Are you surprised? is better quality. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:18:00
Your point above (referring to the other poster's name) added nothing of merit, and in this comment you only complain without offering your argument. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 01:28:02
How exactly would anyone have seen these types of posts for cell phones at that time? Is his post not word of mouth but through the medium of the new age?
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:42:47
While proof for specific instances may be lacking I think there is enough evidence of widespread corruption worldwide that most conspiracy theories are at least plausible, so with that in mind it makes the reversal at least a little more reasonable. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:15:33
At no point did I say I was referring to you. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:39:56
You're in the Bitcoin subreddit - are you surprised his name has Bitcoin in it? 
What I see in these types of threads more than people shilling is people trying to FUD the good news, so I keep my eye out for those who seem to employ as much baseless negativity as they can to sway opinions.
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:03:56
I agree, and I don't support any comments which say such things, but I think it is important to highlight that there is something he could have done differently in this situation that is (now) almost entirely out of his hands. 
So, the people who are victim blaming and trying to bring him down are not helping, but I don't think it's helpful either to fail to acknowledge that he broke one of the cardinal rules of investing, especially in this market. 
Cex.io is at fault, but I think we should all acknowledge he did make an error so that other people might learn from it. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 23:12:56
It took me way too long to realize what I was seeing and consequently hate you. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:19:32
This is very generous of you considering the crypto market is selling at a discount. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:58:32
No, it still applies to this situation. If he had not invested his family's entire wealth (as he put it) then the exchange stealing his funds (which is horrible and should never happen) would not affect him or his family so much. The idea is that the cryptocurrency market in its entirety is volatile and unforgiving and that you should prepare for the worst by not going all in with your finances. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:27:57
If he is providing and profiting from a service then is it not in his best interest to help sustain the ecosystem in which that service thrives? 
Short-sighted greed takes the place of self-interest in most of these crypto debacles.

The fuck is this 
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:49:55
That's the most retarded example I have ever heard. It had nothing to do with their RACE you fucking dimwit - it had to do with those people losing everything and being displaced. You don't think a desperate situation makes people act uncharacteristically? As far as your jail "statistics" maybe consider the fact that black people in America are disproportionately targeted and charged with crimes before you extrapolate your "data" and come off as a racist ass hat. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:43:09
Downvote then, but why waste your words telling everyone else it doesn't belong? It's not 100% relevant but it's one of the better posts since the new year...
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:44:33
Yeah because this sentiment isn't as overdone or cliche as the price predictions, right? Nice meme, I guess? 
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:42:24
Whether or not these types of predictions are inherently true I think they help propagate the rallies that they "predict," at least as far as new money coming to crypto. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:19:38
Oops, I guess I was just trusting what the poster above said. I would be okay with paying huge taxes if it actually went to the benefit of myself and society. As it stands the greatest personal benefit from my taxes is probably free condoms from Planned Parenthood, that damned controversial place. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 00:48:59
I agree with some of what you said but what stands out to me is you're thankful that you went into debt to get an education that is freely available in other countries. 
You don't find it wrong that you needed grants and loans and not just your taxes, like elsewhere? Just because other places have it worse does not mean we should let our standard fall, and it is abundantly clear that the way taxes are collected and distributed favors few. 
I think this is one of the root causes of the violence that is now plaguing our country - gross inequality. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:18:15
I think the difference is Americans pay roughly the same but see NONE (or very nearly) of that as a direct benefit to themselves. Its all used to kill people overseas. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:44:18
Have as many as possible by this time next year.
