E th processed 65% more transactions than Bitcoin yesterday, and basically the 10 days before that too.
And running an e th fullnode with default settings consumes significantly less bandwidth than running a Bitcoin fullnode with default settings.

What does any of that have to do with the high transaction fees, unpredictable confirmation times,  and lower transaction volumes on "growed up" Bitcoin?

Right.  Again, what do the shitcoins that have low use have to do the example coin which has &gt;60% more **actual use** than Bitcoin?

The average transaction fee for an entire day was $7.09 three days ago.  His post wasn't far off.

I'm not sure where you imagined that info from but a full ETH node only consumes 184.81 gb, not much different from Bitcoin.
You can check this on nodestats.org, which is run by BitMex research.
And no blocks are lost on ETH.  A full node without warpsync downloads and verifies every block.

Um, no.  That's full sync with the full block data from every block.
What you are talking about is an archive node, which [does not mean the same thing as a full node or archival node on BTC.](  Archival nodes on Ethereum store a copy of the state index at every previous height, far far more data than is needed for any sort of normal operation, and useless for validation.
It would be like having a Bitcoin node that kept a full copy of the UTXO state at every single blockheight.  Just like on Bitcoin, you can rebuild the UTXO state at any height from using the blockdata - Which a full Ethereum node at 184.81gb already has downloaded.


It must be nice to be smug and wrong at the same time.  You can see the raw stats for fully sync'd geth and parity nodes here: 
Those were sync'd with --syncmode "full" and have pruning disabled.  Pruning is disabled by default, actually, the only way to turn it on is syncing with --no-ancient-blocks enabled on the command line.
Try again?
