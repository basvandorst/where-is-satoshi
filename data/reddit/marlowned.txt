Unless you have a choice. Things like my Hotmail that I don't use for anything important, my Ubisoft account that I only use for forums, my twitter account that aggregates hockey news... Let **me** decide what needs maximum safeguards and what doesn't. I'm not saying security isn't important; I'm saying let the user decide when it is.

To be fair, even as an Apple supporter I do think this is an important issue for the Internet as a whole. I complain when I only get 3 attempts because I always modify passwords slightly (symbols, capitals). I also get pissed when I have to get a goddam confirmation code texted to me because I used my iPad and not my computer. 
I see how these safeguards are extremely valuable to celebrities whose lives are affected by this, and who are constantly being exploited. 
Someone like me, however, wouldn't be affected even if an embarrassing pic of mine was taken. 
So do we go maximum security to protect Jennifer Lawrence? Or risk privacy to make it convenient for putzes like me who have nothing valuable to take?
TL;DR give us tiered security at the user's discretion

lol thanks. My long comment was in the negatives before, but since I came from the front page I'm guessing this isn't the right sub to admit sometimes security isn't a priority.

I do understand. I meant mostly in the context of iCloud and things like the Hotmail address that I use only for Craigslist that has more security hoops than anything else I belong to on the net. I realize MasterCard can't give people the option of lower security and then pay people after all the resulting fraud.
