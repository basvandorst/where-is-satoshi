Not that bad I want gas gift cards now. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 21:00:34
I went to my local BK with a gyft gift card and they accepted it fine, I went through the drive through and he typed in the code with NO issues.

Actually if you buy a bulk amount of USB Block erupters you have a chance of a ROI after half a year.
Investing even 160$ into a 3.3GH block erupter machine can deem it profitable
@_date: 2013-10-20 18:05:06
It looks legit, I just don't have any coins to test it out yet :L
@_date: 2013-10-30 23:51:46
You just said it was a challenge but I guess I can't since I'm not a dev.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:29:49
Thanks for making the bitcoin community a little worse!

@_date: 2013-11-13 02:06:37
I predict the price will change.
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:22:19
I'm a dealer of gift cards also and I had this same thing happen to me.
 I'm underage so I don't have bills to pay, but I've already provided an ID
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:23:17
I think it's just someone unloading
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:37:00
Yes, I can partner if you want to start one
I have funds  but no coding support

I don't recall saying I sold them for cash. I stack silver, and was hoping to convert my investment somewhere else. When the shipping doesn't go good, I can only get half of what I paid for?
I paid in bitcoin, I want to get paid back in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-30 22:37:40
We're going to be showing everything the bitcoin goes towards to.
That means weekly/monthly blog posts showing what it all went to.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:57:34
Up for me, stop being so negative.
@_date: 2013-10-19 04:38:28
Wow, do many things even support 4k ?
I can see those being really cheap though in the future.
Anyways, nice buy I always love me some Amazon :p
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:47:07
I sell amazon codes, best bet it to get someone from amazon live chat confirming there is a balance before you sell it

I've started this, and need help in this being a successful subreddit. I have a basic idea down, and think it can work.
If anyone would like to help, feel free to message me.
@_date: 2013-08-26 17:23:27
Well, here are the basics of what I hope to start up.
- Going to be an automated, instant, and anonymous escrow service.
- Literally will be 100% anonymous, and no account is needed to use the system.
- There will be a 1% fee(still not official) 
- Can't say how it will work, but both parties can have trusted reliable escrow, without the need for anything other than my website.
@_date: 2013-10-08 16:21:35
Any way I could have a bit to test out the system with?
Or find bugs for bounties?
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:52:10
Be careful when telling anyone about what you have.
Because if you tell people your mini fortune, people will start being your "friends"
Happened to me with 100 coins

Malwarebytes is good, I just don't feel the need for it.
I don't download anything, and I know what I'm doing online lol.
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:02:19
Can you withdrawl?
I have 4.7 BTC on there just sitting(I know it's not safe but I cbf moving $1,000 yeah I know)
@_date: 2013-10-30 23:39:42
I know, I don't want to pay 2 grand for a good website coded though.
Could I manage making a site like that for around $100 bucks(paying coders)
@_date: 2013-08-26 14:50:15
Going to check out both.
@_date: 2013-08-26 14:49:54
Isn't a scam, but Kickstarter wouldn't work as this is a bitcoin website I'm planning.
@_date: 2013-08-26 03:20:07
Okay, I'll post it there.
Well I was looking around with creating an asset, and it says I need 5 BTC in order to make an asset.
Any way to get around that?
@_date: 2013-08-26 03:14:37
I'm going to look into BTCT.CO.
Are you aware of me being able to use any of the money, from there to fund this website?
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:42:45
Come to silverbugs we have cookies. (and silver) 
@_date: 2013-10-19 15:35:33
They would obviously want collateral, unless they absolutely trusted the user.
Say someone wants 0.1 BTC, they could provide roughly 7 dollars worth of collateral.

Anyone know why the silkroad logo is like semi-transparent in the background?
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:13:30
Good luck to me I guess..

1. When going to subscribe to the RSS I get this. Seems like it doesn't belong.
2. When I make an account, and after putting in the email I press tab(To go to the password easier) and It does not switch to the password.
Usually when I sign up to a website I press TAB instead of manually clicking on the field to fill out what is needed.
3. It says the password should be 7 characters long, but I just did it with like 6 fine. It should either be reworded or actually require 7 characters.
4. When putting your company info, for the website you can legit put anything. I suggest to make it atleast form with the .com/need an extension to post something, if you understand.
5. When going to the top right corner where your username is, and clicked on your username it takes me here:  
It should actually take me to my profile....
[SUGGESTION] 6. Make it possible to change your profile picture. I don't see an option anywhere, and I'd think it would be appropriate to change your profile picture to a logo or something..
[SUGGESTION] 7. When registering(Don't recall seeing this) you should add an option to put your time zone(Doesn't auto configure it. I'm from EDT and it says Last Login: August 26, 2013 12:33 am)
[SUGGESTION] 8. Make the theme color(Orange for now) be changeable to different colors. Brings the UI up a bit.
[SUGGESTION] 9. When logged in, this option is still available. "Login | Sign Up" It is one of the box's on the page. It should not be there as we are already logged in.
[SUGGESTION] 10. The email from Coinality should not be "wordpress IMO. It should be like "admin@ or contact@ or help@
11. When posting a job offer it says 
But I can upload any kind of file.
12. [SUGGESTION]  Should be in the top bar, as it has everything needed to be in the top bar.
13. [SUGGESTION] There should be a captcha when sending messages to other users, someone could just create a spambot, and annoy the hell out of that user.
14. When you register your account, having your user + pass emailed to you is SUPER insecure, and should be removed(Atleast password)
15. [SUGGESTION] Maybe have some email verification when making an account, as spambots can just lag the website.
16. [SUGGESTION] Remove the [Coinality] and [copy] tags when you are emailing. All popular email websites already say who it's from.
17. [Suggestion] In order to monetize website, you should be able to buy premium "Wanted" advertisements, that automatically go to the top when you search for a job.
Thats all I found for now, edits will be made if I find anything else.
If you need someone like me to run UI or security for the website message me.
I'm really good at improving the UI via suggestions etc.
. :)!
@_date: 2013-08-27 08:05:18
Right now I am, but I'm working on how the system will be flawless. Come drop into the irc I hang out in bitcoin-mmo 
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:40:24
It doesn't have a marketplace feel.
Maybe pay someone to make you a easier to use website, like Craigslist or something.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:24:01
You could have ignored this, and spent 20 seconds of your precious life somewhere else.
@_date: 2013-08-26 19:37:33
Was thinking the same thing.
It could break even in 23 days, and even at like 100m a month
@_date: 2013-09-30 23:43:45
Well since we aren't a prior charity we are starting out from scratch.
I can say we are from NE Ohio.
@_date: 2013-10-20 18:06:41
I'm not sure how others vendors get their cards. But I usually just do online stuff to get the cards. While I can't go into specifics, I obtain my cards 100% legal.
but I assume other vendors who also give out 10% discounted cards are just trying to cash in for bitcoin quicker.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:02:25
From tracing the history of where the coins went they are sitting with other Amagi transactions on a single address. 
I don't think someone would buy like that just to have them stay in one address.
@_date: 2013-08-26 11:55:14
I don't see any other start up companies on btcto. All have already been established. But I'm going to post my idea there and at least get some advice before I ask for help
@_date: 2013-11-16 01:17:11
Go paper wallet, and store what you can on the offline wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:20:55
Don't sell.
@_date: 2013-10-06 19:41:33
Looks interesting.
Good luck. :)!
@_date: 2013-08-26 03:40:06
From my initial reading it looks like most people on there are looking for an established business. My project is just starting 
@_date: 2013-10-25 00:26:58
Actually most anti-virus's just spam your system with "buy now" shit.
And from the year I've owned my new computer I have never had any safety issues, but again I've never clicked on a 0day
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:47:06
Hold it, and act like nothing happened, wait 5 years and profit.
@_date: 2013-10-30 23:35:13
It has been up a little, but I've gotten no orders(unusual)
Coingig isn't that great just because it makes you create a "shop"
I might start a new marketplace to counter both
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:52:55
Yes, I doubt anyone will do that.
I've sold like 10 cards and no one had done it.
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:25:28
+ALL verify
@_date: 2013-10-01 00:14:21
Well since we are only accepting bitcoin as a donation we won't need to file for either of that.(Atleast I think so)
Bitcoin isn't recognized as an official currency in Ohio, so I don't think it will be needed.
I'll consider making a voiceover more indepth
@_date: 2013-10-08 17:31:44
I could possibly test it for a couple credits :P
@_date: 2013-12-28 03:51:03
I know but if all the pools are going after the next block shouldn't it be a little faster.
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:03:11

50 isn't jack to what the average heavy investor has.
@_date: 2013-11-07 03:32:41
Your choice personally I think they are undervalued and will rise a bit more
@_date: 2013-10-03 01:37:44
Wow, all this shit in one day really is strange.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:10:32
Took more effort to generate that link than to just explain.
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:09:19
I just like saying m-bits but whatever floats your boat.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:27:40
I'd rather just get the bitcoin since the price is rising. Considering I paid 4 BTC and only can get a ~50% refund is insane.
@_date: 2013-09-24 20:53:44
I can buy some 
@_date: 2013-08-19 22:34:51
Think you can credit me :p
Site looks good and flush
