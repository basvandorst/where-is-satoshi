Yes I hope a lot of Presidential candidates in many countries will jump on the crypto train. I even think its a good indicator to judge if they are good politician leaders because no matter what kind of politics they stand for - the embracing of crypto crowd means that a politician is modern, open minded and smart.

Interesting and some good points. 
"Wealth distribution is "just" a political and social fairness question." 
Here I can't agree because I think that a currency will die one day if it isn't as perfect as possible for its time. 
A wealth distribution doesn't has to be 100% but it has to try to tend. Otherwise it will collapse like currencies often do. How long is the average lifespan of a currency? Something like around 50 years?
And hey, there is a superior purpose for money than facilitate exchanges, its creating wealth for society (not individual) to enable development. Maybe thats not written down in your schoolbook of economics but in your genes.

*Im not in coding at all.*
Whats the hardest part of coding?
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:49:22
wow, this much
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:57:36
It seems me too much to call it a fat finger. There are just a hand full of people who have got such a huge amount of money. And I can't imagine that one of this would risk all his money in doing this.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:38:56
I wonder how some coin-teams do it when they have a founder and a lead dev. Obviously the founder isn't the lead dev in that case.

Under 10 000 its a good purchase. Wait for next November.

What about kids without parents?
Isnt humanity the parents of all following kids?

Money comes from Korea because the Koreans are clever. By the way: there is no dump - just pump.

There would be tremendous wealth.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:49:46
Why is a centralized authority is needed? It just has to be defined in code. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:57:00
There are a lot of kids without parents.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:02:17
Interesting theory. Its possible. But I think the rising price is because of crypto funds entering the market.

What ist the most important code-language used for coins?

Can I see somewhere how much new users creating new accounts at coinbase? Would be interesting.

What is the difference between software engineer and programmer?
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:00:43
I agree. The early pioneers deserve just the best. But as may know from history: a system has got a lifetime and one day its dying. Now we have the chance to think what could be next.
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:39:21
Yes, thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:54:36
Your stake would be your private property.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:12:32
Yes thats why Im surprised there can't be much people who would be willing or even be able to do that. What about a small group of huge exchanges? They hold all the private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:00:39
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:22:30
Yes and Vertcoin
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:21:32
could that mean we need more focus on decentralization?
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:28:09
Ah ok, thats interesting.
I always wonder how huge coding projects work. Because there is probably no-one who could code or read or understand everything.
But someone has to manage.
Do you think a project like creating a coin could be managed by someone without coding-knowledge?

They have to pay him. Its just a business for both. Thats not that hard. Very rich and powerful guys give much money to poor guys. The poor can't steal anything because his family would be killed. Thats the business.
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:02:01
Great cap!!!!
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:35:32
It will do that? Sounds great. How do you know that?
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:08:33
No, banks always use situations like that and go short to drop price more and buy back later cheap.
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:48:21
What was the goal of that race? What was the requirement to win?
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:22:49
If Alza got a green mascot they should consider to accept Vertcoin payment urgently.
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:52:49
Who cares about fluctuating? Everything in the whole world is constantly fluctuating.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:05:49
Especially vertcoin is improving a lot.

Does someone know how many coins are ready for Lightning Network now?

If I would like to travel the world and just pay with crypto, how can I know if and where to pay with cryptocurrency?
I mean, imagine you are in a big city of a foreign country, how to figure out where you can pay with BTC?

If you're funding - you're controlling.

Tether is weakening USD. Its like inflation. Controlled by others than the US-guys. Thats why USA hates it.
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:10:25
Ok but this competition was a bit weird as there are individual challenges for ever form of payment. 
Much more amazing is the option and ability really to pay just with bitcoin in many cities, I think. Im stunned. (Sorry if that sounds a bit rude, its bc my english is not very good enough.)
And: Agree videos like hers deserve more attention and Im sure they will get once people know about it.
@_date: 2018-03-05 07:10:22
ITNS needs to be on more exchanges.
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:40:43
Lieferando even accepts BCH now. I hope they will accept Vertcoin, too.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:14:26
Question is if that was possible at a random place or at a BTC hot spot? 3 years ago? That was early. Cant imagine that there have been many places where that could be done.

Looking forward to Vertbase (gateway to change fiat into crypto directly)
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:14:00
Looking forward to that. I remember when the first coins used SegWit last year and suddenly SW became standard everywhere. 
Lightning enabled coins could strike up a prospering partnership soon.

Bitpay is expensive.

What I did see is that she is paying by smartphone and QR-code/QR-codereader.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:33:05
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:01:20
Do they accept Vertcoin and other crypto, too?
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:57:16
No, banks go short now trying to buy back cheaper.
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:54:05

I think its important to spend coins. People forget that coins wouldnt rise if noone would spend.

Ok but how did this girl figure out where to pay?
(I dont want to watch all the videos now)
Is there an overview for the whole world - some sort of steadily updated database?

Yes, thats it.

Rest of MTGox coins wont be sold because the former customers can be paid off with fiat restlessly now.

Alright, then it would be good to have an alternative.

We should buy 1 share of these banks and then go to their annual general meeting to protest.
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:22:14
No matter, a bank with that behaviour has to be destroyed.
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:26:07
F*ck this shit bank.
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:15:29
Who lives next to the place where the banks annual meeting is done should buy just 1 share and protest at the meeting.
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:48:51
Thats great.
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:16:56
No, blame the bank and put pressure on it. The bank itself has to blame the congressman and feds.

Bitpay is horrible now. You even can not see the adress itself just a qr code.
