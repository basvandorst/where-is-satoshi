@_date: 2018-03-12 15:33:55
In my opinion, Btc is going down hard. The 15% climb we saw the past 24h was all the fuel needed for bears to continue. We haven't been out of the bear market from 17 December......
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:10:42
are you sure about 6k bottom ?
i not...
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:19:02

btc is in downtrend ,
look at 1d chart...
i am fan of btc,
but downtread is here and is strong...
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:30:01
 If you look on the chart you'll see that exactly one year ago price was "just" $1000, even at 5k price will still be up 400% since then, but has bitcoin's utility gone up 400% since then? I don't know anyone rushing to go buy bitcoin for its utility, we've got Visa or Paypal for that, so there is mostly speculative buyers in this market, "hodlers". And for that, speculation, bitcoin remains a fine tool.

btc is in downtrend,strong downtred from 17 dec, i am btc fan,but now i have all my btc sell, 100% sure ,double bottom..... at least double bottom...
1- We are in a bear market for while now, meaning no new money coming in to sustain the price or increase it. A lot of people will stay out of this until things improves. Bitcoin drops as hard as it goes up, don't bet against the trend
2- We need to retest the 6k to make sure its a true bottom
3- No one knows what the hell is going with Mt. Gox bitcoins
4- Sentiment toward bitcoin price is mixed between bitcoiners
5- There are still issues with the stock especially with USA tariffs and the effect on that is glob
