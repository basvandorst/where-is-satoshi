Hey I don't agree with you but I don't think you should have been talked to the way that you were. I hope everyone continue to be vigilant and curious about all changes to the protocol and focus on furthering Bitcoin.

Good point.

Do you have the original link to the Bitcoin money map?
@_date: 2017-10-06 06:57:04

Hi! Looking at your comments it seems you're quite level-headed but are taken the wrong way by our fellow r/bitcoin'ers sometimes, here is an actual answer from Pierre for the first part of your question, I hope you don't become discouraged to post real questions!

More like less panic market action when split

Hopefully more exchanges will follow suit... Hopefully we can do this on decentralized exchanges in the future :-)
