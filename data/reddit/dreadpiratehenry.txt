Barriers to entry, yes. Unsolvable, definitely not. Bitcoin is now in what you could think of as its "Windows 3.0" phase, where it's quite a long way ahead of the curve and is too difficult to use for anyone but real enthusiasts. Going mainstream requires public confidence and ease of use, neither of which are hallmarks of BTC's ecosystem at the moment.
But once those are solved, the real revolution begins.

That part is obvious, but it will apply to a relatively small number of people. Not enough to turn an entire economic system upsidedown.


I would more interested in your assertion that it would somehow "fix capitalism". The percentage of people driven by idealism has *always* been dwarfed by the percentage driven by selfishness and short-term greed.

Cell phones existed (in some form) for almost 20 years before they were used by the majority of people.

How long did you think adoption of a radically different kind of currency would take? Especially one with all kinds of historical justification for caution and skepticism. For a change like that to happen in less than 10-15 years is HUGE. Be patient. It's a matter of when, not if.

From a retailer's perspective, Bitcoin users are an infinitesimally small customer base. Here's the math every C-level manager wants to see:
"It's going to cost *x* to implement and support this, and I'm going to make an additional *y* profit."
If *x* &gt; *y*, there's no business case for doing it. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:05:22
Think of it from the perspective of the mass user: They just want it to work, easily and predictably, *without* having to concern themselves with *how* it works. Nobody gives a shit *how* it works. Nobody gives a shit about the underlying tech.
It has to get to the point where any user can create and fund an account with zero understanding of how it works and as few hurdles (e.g., cumbersome account verification) as possible, and do it instantly. Multi-*hour* delays are unacceptable, let along multi-*day* delays. The market just won't tolerate processes that are that immature.

How? Please explain your reasoning here. I don't see it.


Nope. Fixing capitalism will take a lot more than a new type of currency. The things that are wrong with capitalism are the things that are wrong with *people*, and those things aren't going to change.

If she's in most of the US, it's illegal for her to take *payment* for sex. The currency doesn't matter. It doesn't matter whether someone gives her US$500, 1.2 BTC, or 50 chickens. Exchanging anything of value for sex is illegal.

Tying BTC to any fiat currency is specifically what it's meant to avoid. And why would you choose USD, instead of Thai baht or Argentine pesos or Japanese yen?

Not to defend unwarranted asshattery, but you haven't seen anything yet.

The fact that it has an exchange value against the USD does not mean that it is tied to it, anymore than the USD is "tied to" the JPY. However, as long as it is a highly volatile currency, it will make sense to express it's value in some relatively stable (and familiar) fiat currency at the time of a transaction, just like any other currency exchange.

Account numbers might be required on assets that have account numbers, but they certainly aren't on assets like furniture, jewelry or cash. The fact that BTC may be among the assets is simply a non-issue. An asset is an asset.

@_date: 2013-04-11 18:44:52
I see Bitcoin's current state as being analogous to the internet in the 80's, when only a few people had access. Right now, BTC is hard as fuck to buy, so only the most interested and determined people are participating. If/when it becomes ubiquitous -- meaning easy to buy and spend BTC -- it will be a whole other world. With built-in scarcity and an ultimate cap, I could easily imagine BTC going for US$10k once it's easier to use.
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:34:41

@_date: 2013-12-04 06:54:12
Not too likely, at least not in a *few* years.
Here's why: Computing power takes phenomenal time and effort to scale. Even at the pace of Moore's law (Google it), it would take 900 years to make computing power a *billion* times faster than it is today, whereas making ciphertext many *billions of billions of billions (etc.)* of times more difficult to crack takes only minutes.

Most Americans don't yet understand what exactly it is, if they've heard of it at all.
Those who have heard of it have probably heard the horror stories, the booms and busts, the Mt Gox nightmares, The Silk Road nightmares, and just aren't attracted to it. For probably the overwhelming majority, it doesn't solve any problem they have or fill any need they perceive, or if it does, it's not yet worth the *significant* hassle and risk.

Is that even a serious question? Of course it will. First of all, the SR is not the center of the Bitcoin universe, despite what breathless pseudo-journalists would have everyone believe. Second, this kind of volatility is to be expected of a currency that's in its infancy, and whether it succeeds or fails will be determined by many factors that have nothing to do with the Silk Road. A 15-20% drop can hardly be called a "collapse".
The Silk Road will be replaced quickly by numerous clones, the first of which will almost certainly reappear before the end of the year, and having learned lessons from the amateurish SR blunders, they'll be even harder to do anything about.
