If you sold at 19k you could buy back the same amount for the half... still 50k profit for the house. But to be honest - a house is my goal, too. I dont want to get filthy rich. If I can afford a house, I would sell.

You can fit nearly every curve to fit into this by scaling. But the point "today" was on the 30th december I guess.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:10:38
I see, thank you! Looking forward if the 7 day prediction will be correct.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:59:41
and with "buy orders" you mean "sell orders"? :D
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:19:24
9k I believe. The support is tested far too often and will break. 8k are much more realistic I guess.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:58:49
Crashes like this happened before and will happen in the future, too. Only question is where the floor is. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:03:54
You mean it is in 90 % accurate and fails only in 10 %? What charts are you using? I see a great difference between the different tools there. The BTC 24h chart predicts 24k by tonight, which is absolutely not happening. The 7 days charts predicts 8,3k for tonight. 
edit. Predictions are crazy at the moment. 24k for tonight, 1400 for the 18th... 
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:13:20
Stairway to moon :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:59:28
+1. Done.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:56:42
Maybe the 8k was not so wrong after all.
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:18:58


For serious offers you need serious interest. Maybe you wanted to write "12.24$ per mBTC"?
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:13:26
It went down nearly 50 % from it´s ATH some weeks ago. I call that a dip :)
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:10:09
That´s probably correct. The google logarithm is much more complex than it was 5 years ago. A lot of factors come in place and the classic "keywords" are no longer the decisive one. If you link alot of sites together, and a lot of users click on these links, googles conclusion is that these are similar and shows them together.
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:33:04
Lol, they misspelled "guessing" and typed "Research". Maybe that guessing was correct when silk road flourished. But nowadays bitcoin is not secure enough to buy illegal stuff, there are other cryptos for that.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:55:23
Worst case is dipping to 4k and then bear market until late 2018... But I expect a bounce back between 7 and 8k!
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:39:15
Even then he forgot a 0 at the end? Maybe he means mBTC
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:46:57
Let me take a guess: The number of new registration is very low at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:03:31
What you wanted to say is "they even spent money on AdWords"... SEO is just the optimization of content for search engines. Google is user sensitive, it shows the content you "want" to see, or what the logarithms thinks you want to see. That does have nothing to do with paying cash to be there.
My first hits are different than yours. Also, bitcoin cash is inside of them,too. It is a huge sub and does have the name Bitcoin, too. So it is completely normal.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:16:12
Sadly, if it bounces 1 or 2 times and then full up it´s fine. But if it bounces more often and comes back every time, faith will diminish and we will see us at 8k. It broke through already and does have some difficulties getting up at the moment. I am afraid we will test the 10k again. In February, from 9 to 10k.
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:04:08
I found a "paper wallet" with scratch-off keys... sounds legit!
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:44:18
I tried Neurobot, too, but it failed terrible the one time I relied on it. I hope this time the prediction is correct and we will see a bounce back after hitting 8,7k
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:58:17
Nobody knows, but at the moment it looks good. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:09:23
It´s already over 10k again. But it wont stay there for long.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:57:51
I expect nothing. Everytime I expect something I goes horrible wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:19:23
As far as I heard/ read there were only 5000 BTC in these contracts. Also, every contract does have 2 sides, so one is interested in going down, one in going up. I am sure the market is manipulated in both directions, but I dont know how big the Futures does play a role.
January, bans, FUD does play a bigger role in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:57:47
I dont think we get this low. Between 7 - 8k I would feel comfortable buying more
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:57:23
HODL it until BTC is 1 million. Then you can withdraw it.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:28:39
Thats exactly the problem. I am very confident that this is a scam. If you load too much btc into these wallets, they are gone. I mean: Selling an empty paper wallet? Why on earth should I buy this.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:40:06
pilotavery is correct. You already have some kind of malware/ adware. Neurobot is clean.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:07:43
Yes. No. Yes. No! I said I am loosing interest in the South Korea ban. That´s meant to be bullish on my side, because only if people freak out the are selling, right?

A correction can be in both ways. After a dip there´s often a light correction up... let´s see what happens next.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:42:56
Fees are ridiculous for too many inputs at the moment. It does help when you transfer everything to an exchange and then back... If you transfer a small amount you sometimes pay the same amount, so you can transfer everything. When you transfer back, you will only have 1 input and it will keep the fees low for your wallet. Of course you have to pay the fee from the exchange back to your wallet - but if you use the GDAX workaround you get that for free (move coins from coinbase to GDAX (without fee) and withdraw it from there to your private wallet (without network fee). Dont know if this still works, but it did for me 2 weeks ago :)
I dont know if this works when you transfer from one private address to a new one... could work, too? I dont know - for that my knowledge is too low.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:38:54
I think it will drop below 8k tomorrow and then should bounce back. Floor maybe between 7.6 - 7.8k. After that 15k next week. Just my guessing - dont trust me.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:36:24
Buy back at 4k
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:15:28
It will bounce! Maybe not today, but somewhen in the future
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:10:58
I do, and she helps me to keep confidence to hodl. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:02:00
Europe is awake for approx. 6 hours now (depends on where you are)... That was no settle, that was a dead cat bounce. We are still going down.

Right - I wanted to ask how much sat per byte he paid. With the transaction ID i could have a look. 
Theres low fees - it takes a while, but comes through sometimes. And theres too low fees - taking ages. Sorry for the bad expression.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:54:57
You could buy low on Bitfines (at 14.600 USD), send to GDAX, sell for 14.500 €, buy ether, send back to bitfinex. Repeat. I am too afraid to do, though.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:04:10
OMG! It didnt double in price since 48h! GET ALL OUT!
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:48:53
Let me guess: You panic sold and now wish the price would drop, that´s the reason for the FUD? :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:02:35
AFAIK Either it will go through or the tx will drop out of mempool in some weeks. You will get it back, dont worry.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:18:44
One does not simply call a tiny correction a dip. One week ago we had 10k. We are at 14k...! come on.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:33:11
GDAX deposit is working in few hours. Post some information (transaction id). Maybe too low fees?
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:18:15
That´s a good and smart move. Congratz!

@_date: 2017-12-24 21:09:29
More Like 9k.... But yes, correction is not finished. Not enought push atm
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:06:46
They also predict 60k in 2018... 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:53:35
One week ago we were at 10k... that´s just a normal correction.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:55:17


Just checked it. Looks like it got confirmed now :) it was a very low fee. For that the tx was very fast. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:10:43
The price and fees exploded. Segwit is also available. Everybody talks about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:59:57

@_date: 2017-12-01 08:36:46
well, that´s what the game is - speculations :) We are still in an downward trend. The rise from 8,8 to 9,8k could only be a correction from the strong dip before. That´s only my opinion - feel free to think whatever you want of course! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:02:57
it´s down for me since 1h

@_date: 2017-12-07 18:52:09
But to be honest - people are buying solar arrays and put them on their roof to make money, too. They buy gold to make money... they deposit money on index funds to make money. Not with that speed, but just because people want to make money it is not a real factor something will crash. That fast growth will bring a big correction for sure. But that correction could be lower than the ATH next week. Noone knows.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:29:41

This is different. The huge fees make btc unusable at the moment. I sold 70 % of my btc on the exchange and hodling 30 % on the ledger, only because I pay more fees to transfer it in time to an exchange... forced hodling. Could be 11k the bottom... 9k. 4k... 0? I dont want to risk it. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:15:13
It is surely only stuck somehow. Support is maybe a little bit slow at the moment. I bought 1 week ago and it worked very fast. Dont worry... maybe just a little forced HODL :)
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:20:53
Your 100 USD note is worth 1 cent. Fiat is a bubble!
edit: It´s true.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:51:33
it could go up to 100.000 or 1.000.000... it could stay at 11k. It could go down to 0. Your decision.

How did you pay? Did the money arrive there? What does your account details say about it?

Remember, the ATH from yesterday is the dip tomorrow!
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:47:31
As far as I know thats a myth. It can expire, but it is very unlikeley, because there´s always some nodes sending the tx again and again as long as it is not confirmed. But you could send the tx again with higher fees. The lower one will then be rejected because of double spend. You can do that in your own wallet, but not from any exchange of course.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:58:45
yes. 9k are definitely possible during the holidays. Even down to 5k is a possibility. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:38:53
Mine took 18h and went through fine. dont worry
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:36:22
Okay, I didnt know that. I just heard from the 30 % from my financial advisor. So it could be everything between 0 - 45 %, depends on your income
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:10:46
No, only if you sell in the first year. No taxes for buying or selling apart of that. luckily
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:59:53
Sometimes the next dip will not go below the current price... just saying. In my opinion: Buy now and HODL for some years. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:53:42
Bought a 300 bucks graphics card that would be worth $2000 now. I dont regret it - I like to use btc
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:54:31
It will dip. But maybe the next dip will be higher than the current ath.

made my day. Thanks :D
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:58:04

@_date: 2017-12-22 18:51:14
I requested larger withdraws. It took 2 weeks, but without any real reason it got lifted up to 50k few days ago. So - i dont think so.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:36:32
I dont think it will go that low. 11k was the bottom advertised everywhere. If it drops that low it could rebounce.... or even now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:19:06
Yes. The explanation is Bitcoin. No - seriously, the best explanation is FOMO and Futures trading next Monday.
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:18:46
Even the same image used. That´s a Scam for sure. Sorry.
Another one, also saying it´s "gold"
But I dont believe it is really gold... it´s a gold color. Thats all. But I wonder how he spent 0.02 bucks on that single one... maybe he ordered 100?
Edit: A "Scam" was a little harsh... it´s not a scam if you pay 15 CAD for it, just overpriced... but if he really paid 0,02 btc on it he got scamed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:05:03
Yep. The dip today was the capitulation when alot of weak hands sold. The cycle starts anew 
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:54:02
In Germany you only pax taxes if you cash out before 1 year  pasts since you bought it. If you hodl longer than 1 year it´s completely tax-free.
If you cash out in the 1st year you pay 30 % on the profit.
Edit: As someone statet it depends on your income. The tax if you cash out in the 1st year is something between 0 up to 45 %
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:55:08
Something between "not at all" up to "all the way down". My guess is not that much, because there are too much buyers waiting for a dip to buy in. But that´s just a guess. Make your own.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:58:10
You traded your btc to bcash, not ver. Blame is on you. But im sorry for your loss, though
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:06:23
then you have to pay 2 btc for that, sorry. We now have a solution for "how to spend 2 btc" in 2 minutes
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:11:58
Bitcoin is dead. This time for sure. We never had such a huge dip since... a week!
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:27:20
More like an downtrend to 9k

You could post on their FB wall... that usually helps faster

Futures are working in both directions - short and long. At the moment it is much easier to earn some money with a long position cause bitcoin is always rising
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:56:38
I am really happy that there is a small correction at the moment. Then more it´s pumping, then more its dumping. I hope we will have a 15k price for some days to create a bottom before Monday.

@_date: 2017-12-17 09:05:28
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:55:53
It doenst matter how much it is. If you invest 1000 dollar you buy for 1000 dollar. It doesnt matter if you get 1 btc or 0.05 btc. It´s all about percentages. If it rises 50 % you get 50 % on whatever you invested
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:39:20
You dipped your toe too strong! That´s because it´s going down now. Next time, do it more gently. And for now - hold on :)

Bitcoin had a large bullride, need some recovery... BCH is too risky for me. Maybe BTC will lose some value over the weekend, but it will catch up later. I read alot of guys saying they are gonna dump BCH when it hits a new ATH. I won´t count on that - but thats only my opinion. I hold
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:22:25
A lot of hashing power moved to BCH, therefor blocktime went up and SegWit relates on the next difficulty adjustment.

I too had some problems with 2FA. Just create a new wallet with any bitcoin wallet (electrum for example), import your private keys and disable the 2FA (theres a checkbox when importing asking if you want to keep 2FA or if you want to disable it). 
Also, a Hardware Wallet just holds your private keys. The BTC are still inside the Blockchain. You can´t "extract" or move funds out of the Blockchain. The Blockchain is Bitcoin.

there´s alot of FUD, and BCH does have improvements BTC can´t deliver at the moment. I guess there´s a little bit fear inside the FUD. 
Redditor for 3 month only says I´ve been here for 3 month now I guess.
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:06:32
The difficulty of BCH should rise 300 % in 16hr. SegWit activates in about 30 hours (depends on the hashrate). BTCs difficulty will fall about 7 %. BTC will be more profitable after that. I think yes, they will switch back. But even if they dont - blocktime will be at around 10 minutes, thats the target of the difficulty-adjustment. It´s not necessary that all miners switch back.
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:48:05
I still have to learn then :)
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:55:45
I will hold until I really need the money. No need to get out now and regret it later. I thought about Bitcoins when they were about 1$... and did nothing because I was afraid losing 100 bucks... it was alot of money to me, but nowadays its not much anymore. So I will hold until it´s really alot or I need the money
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:07:58
I personally think there will be a correction down soon. But you never know. No one knows. We do have a very strong support at 2700... So even if it falls. It will rise after that. Maybe it will rise over 4000 soon... could be, too.
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:05:16
You own twice as much as I do then. You really should regret that! Shame on you... :P
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:50:18
It doesnt matter if you wrote down the private keys or not. You can extract them from your wallet. So, if you have login to your wallet
1) Login
2) Extract private keys from the wallet
3) download electrum and install it
4) start electrum, say you want to restore a wallet
5) insert private keys you got from the blockchain.info wallet
6) disable the 2FA
7) your good to go
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:22:24
My whole portfolio is down 30 %. But thats the market - up and down. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:38:27
So far it is quite risky and hard to trade the forked Bitcoin. I guess thats why most people still sit on it. As soon as it is adopted to the big markets price could drop. Or it will rise further. Who knows! I thought the price will go down like Ether Classic after the fork... really. I didnt expect that.
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:50:09
From 7,4 down to 4,5 exahashes
I am not feeling comfortable with that.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:15:05
I really think BTC will make it to SegWit before it crashes, but to shout out "FUD" when someone posts reasonable diagrams is dangerous. 
You can read everywhere at the moment that transactions are stuck for more than 10h. Even with proper fees. On the diagram you can see why - mempool is flooding, hashingpower is decreasing. 
This will, most probably, change when BCH difficulty will increase. But its not only FUD, it´s a real threat.
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:30:21
Yes, as far as I know even the BCH community knows the Hashrate is temporary. But they are hoping BTC is dead until the next difficulty increase. So long it does not looks like this will happen.
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:28:12
Wouldn´t that litter the blockchain very badly? Even with 8mb blocks you would need 12.800 blocks for your 100GB?
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:44:05
and it went down :D Hopefully it crashes hard, so I can buy more :) Dont panic - will go up soon

@_date: 2017-08-30 07:40:57
Okay, I see.
You can extract the private keys from the blockchain.info wallet. Note: I did not read the article. But the headline sounds like it should work.
After you do have the private keys, you can import them in electrum or another wallet and disable 2FA
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:42:02
I too sold my BCH for 250$ because all the FUD... :/ The next difficulty increase for BCH will happen in the next 2 days... SegWit will lock in, too. The miners that switched to BCH will switch back to BTC then.
Best thing would be to not look at the BTC until SegWit :) If you can´t sleep set a stop Sell for your BTC at 3700... because it will go down to 3200 if it hits that value (I read so... i´m no expert, don´t trust me!). So you will save some bucks and can rebuy at 3200 then. 
edit: You can see the ca. hashrate here... 
it went down for BTC from 95 to 70%... Blocktime went up to 16 minutes. Not good, but not devastating.
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:59:22
And you are sure you have some btc in your wallet? Have a look bottom left. The "Balance" should be higher than the amount you want to send of course.
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:29:43
I really dont know, but I think time beeing here and reputation of BTC is just too solid. My best guess that BTC will recover after SegWit activates and difficulty of BCH rose.
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:49:00
Lucky you. It is decreasing before you buy in? For me it is increasing before I buy and decreasing after i bought :D
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:32:58
I see. Thanks, that helped alot. You enlightend me today :)
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:31:47
I am using the Ledger Nano Hardware wallet and it was the fee the app proposed as standard. I don´t know if I was just lucky or it will be the normal Segwit fee for transactions in the future. I am seeing a lot of people with stuck transactions at the moment.
@_date: 2017-08-28 06:59:40
nope, that one is about the fees :) But actual they are going down at the moment, too. If you watch a chart and down zoom in, of course, not
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:43:01
I couldnt have done it better!... wait, i´m a designer. I could have done it better.
@_date: 2017-08-11 05:15:10
I am curious! So, if the mempool fills, all the fees stacking together and are given to the miner that mines the block? If so - I don´t think the risk of a death spiral is very likely. Even if some miners are switching... in that moment the difficulty of BCH will rise, it will get less profitable, and the mempool of BTC (and therefore the reward...) will fill up. Did I get that right?
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:09:18
For a rise from 20 to 77$ you must have bought in April when the price was 1/3... no way you could have made that in 2 days.
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:44:43
Yes, it´s me. I sold some of my coins. Sorry

You mistake SegWit with Lightning Network. SegWit will activate tomorrow ( When SegWit is activated, Lightning COULD be activated. But there´s no ETA for that. Could be month to go

Depens where you´re from... But yes should be the answer most times.

that´s a really slow bank transfer. In germany it takes 0.2 to 1 day if you do it online. My recent btc transaction took longer. Took a low fee, though
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:06:28
I just would not switch from btc to bch - too risky. Even IF BTC will die, what i really doubt, it would take a long time
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:28:23
BCH Fanbase is saying BTC will die soon, because the "Chain Death Spiral". BTC Fanbase is telling BCH will die because "Chain Death Spiral" when difficulty of BCH will increase. Both sides tell you their coin is doing fine.
The war between both sides drops the price of both coins. BTC is older and much more solid, so it bounces of the 4000 resistance like theres no way down. BCH does not have such a solid base... if the 600 breaks it will go down further.
My guess. BTC will stay on the 4000 resistance until SegWit activates and BCH difficulty increases. After that it will go up strong.
@_date: 2017-08-30 07:25:00
Maybe he should just put a small amount into it. 2 BTCs... could be enough for retirement in 10 years. It´s very risky to put everything inside a crypto

well... I wish I know. Next big resistance is at 3200 :/
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:56:04
Its BCH, not BCC. I think your BCH are lost. Also, you cannot send BCH with electrum. It will always send your BTC. So, these send to a BCC address are also lost
@_date: 2017-08-30 07:14:19
Never heard of any case yet. But just move your BTC to a new wallet before using your private key to get the BCH. Easy as that.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:56:50
could also be just a dead cat bounce... you never know

@_date: 2017-08-13 17:42:26
Welcome in board!
If it falls, do yourself a favor. Don´t look at the price and come back in 1 month. As i bought in July there was also a small correction down some hundred bucks and it made me crazy. But then it rose again :) As it always do
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:44:28
Just hold - you are as lucky as everyone holding btc. Its going up
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:05:11
I can´t see any support at 3800, thats the reason why it felt straight through. Next support is between 3200 and 3400. And if it is falling too fast and if it will break through before SegWit it could fall down to 2800. But i don´t think it will. Maybe 3300...
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:20:49
Its a little bit confusing at beginning, thats absolutely normal. My advice - start small. Invest only a little bit. Maybe start with 100mBTC (0.1 BTC) if you can afford loosing it. Send your 100 mBTC to your wallet (I recommend using electrum (electrum.org)). Hold it for 2 weeks and see how it goes. If you can afford more, buy more when it dips. Dont get in when its exploding (like this week). In 90% it will dip after a huge growth and will recover after the dip, so its best buying then
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:56:20

Sorry, that´s not correct. It´s all about %, not about $. If BTC rise 10 % you get 10 % of your investment. If an altcoin rise 10 %, you get 10 %. 
And btc gives you the best % and also the most secure in the long term. When you invest 196 $ what do you expect? To be rich in 2 month? You wont find anything anywhere anytime.
Btc rose approx. 2300 % in 2017. If it continues that trend you will have 4500 $ from your 196 at the end of 2018. Show me anything similar please.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:38:36

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:24:41
There was a flash crash down to 10000 dollar... "down". Remember when we hit 9k. I mean... give it some time. Some big trader must have started market orders, otherwise there is no way someone is selling for 10k when you can get 10700.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:57:16
No need for a sorry, I just wanted you to be clear about that. There are many users dont know that fact :) As long as you are curious and asking questions you will be fine. Welcome to the crypto-world!
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:59:07
The growth of bitcoin is most likely an S curve... like most great inventions. That means we are entering the early majority phase now. Price could shoot up on this level for quite some time until slowing down its movement and finally settles on a stable price. Could be anywhere... 100.000, 1.000.000.... 
Have a look:
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:00:43
You really should SELL as fast as you can! It will crash
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:20:13
I am not sure if we reach 10k at the moment. Everyone is expecting a correction of something between 10 - 20 %. Maybe a lot of people cashing out right now. 
To answer your question: Yes, I did sell 50 % at 9750... Not sure if it was a good move, but I do expect a dip, too.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:14:02
Yes, you are right. I know that and I am thinking the same. But still, I feel sorry for him. You can think about someone doing really stupid things and still feel sorry for him. It´s not called empathy when you only feel sorry for someone making the same mistakes as you. And I do have plenty of empathy left - dont worry :D
Conclusion: Yes, he made a stupid and risky move. And now he´s paying for it. Feeling sorry that he learned it the hard way.

Because, if both chains survice, you will have coins on both chains. And besides Bitcoin Gold there´s much more hope for the 2x coin to survice than there was for bch and bitcoin gold - therefore higher futures price for the x2 and higher demand to have some coins there, too. My guess

No, Bittrex is neither fraud nor money laundering. They are quite a while on the market. Sometime, though, systems produce errors.

Sure, I did not tell that I dont think it was a really stupid move. But I still can feel sorry for him, too. It was a stubborn investment. But you know, most people would say that about btc, too.

No, it´s not stable. Only invest your 1000 bucks if you are willing to loose it. On the other hand, your 1000 $ could be 10.000 $ by the end of next year. But it could crash to 10 $, too.

@_date: 2017-11-08 13:59:22
If it was that account there must be an order history. Have a look at that. 
Get in contact with coinbase as soon as possible. The money from your bank will need a while to arrive at coinbase, there´s time to cancel the order - or change the wallet address the bitcoin is going to. It should be your wallet then :) 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:11:13
When you can sell 1btc for 100k it is worth 100k. Or do you sometimes think "well, that 100 dollar bill... for me it is only 1 cent worth - because it is only paper. And paper is cheap"?
If 1oz gold is worth 1300 dollar people are paying 1300 dollar for it. Not 130. And you can break down bitcoin to very small units. You can sell 0.01 of your btc and do have 0.99 left. You can do that until you are at zero. As you can do with gold... 1kg, 1oz, 1g... easy as that.
People are buying btc because the price is rising. And as a trader you surely know how a market works. As long as there are profits to be made there will be buyers. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:50:35

I was very doubtful it goes below 12k... and 11k. And 10k... If we go for a full bubble burst we could see 5k and then stable ground at 7500

Some say it goes down to 7k, some say 6k, some say 5k and some say even lower... Nobody knows. Can be everything. Even 0. But also 20k in march. The funny part of this shit is, everyone was laughing at the guys spreading FUD before we hit 15k that it could dip under 10k again... I was laughing, too. Now I am not laughing anymore :( 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:13:49
If you overlay the "classic" bubble burst chart with bitcoin chart you see that the mean level is somewhere between 7300 - 7500. The despair somewhere around 5000... Of course we all know these charts does not work with bitcoin. But it is used alot as a reference. This reference is only 800$ down from the current price to the mean level.
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:17:41
Dip the dip!
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:33:30
Unfortunately thats not correct. There are no bitcoin released every x minutes. It has to be solved. If 50 % of miners are turning off it will take about 20 minutes for a block. If that happens the difficulty adjustment would take several weeks - too long to sustain the other miners if price drops further.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:00:16

1: Only invest what you can afford to lose
2: If you invested more than that, check your portfolio more often
3: you can now cut the losses and sell with a loss or you wait, price will maybe dip further, but it will rebound sometimes this year. If you can wait.
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:54:45
It will fall even more now... I will wait some days and buy at 2800

There are a lot of people bought in at every price... I bought in at a much lower price, but I will sell before I make losses. So, if the price reaches my entry point +10 % I am out, too. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:30:28
thats correct, but the difficulty needs loooong time to adjust. No miner is going to pay for mining several weeks. If the price drops below the production cost bitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:54:29
I have to contradict. When they create a picture with a rising bitcoin chart and Kim, and telling crises like the north korea crisis are creating gains for bitcoin they connote exactly this. 
Some people are using btc as an alternative currency during crises. But honestly - how much btc does the Venezuelans  bought with their cheap money... They are damn poor - dont think they changed anything. Also - no electricity, no internet = no bitcoins. Bitcoin is not to be used during wars. They are completely misleading the true nature of Cryptos in my eyes.
The video does not denounce Bitcoin at all - it is a positive video about bitcoin. But they are saying "it will be stable because there are crises everywhere"... thats bullshit. What a great vision... only if there are crises it will be worth? And if there is no crises... then fiat? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:07:09
Now i got it, thanks and sorry!
Only reason could be that you didnt send your BTC to a new wallet and entered the private key somewhere where it could be exploited?
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:06:35

Even when this graph is correct, we will go down to 5k (despair) and then find a new stable ground (mean) at 7500. Isnt that far from now, right.

Most will sell. Think about it, if you would not have any exhange. I wouldnt trade with unknown people over the internet. Too much scam
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:39:08
We had 80 % drops and long bear markets over years before there was BCH. I really dont think that adding BCH to coinbase does have anything to do with it. The rapid hype and now all the FUD is the problem.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:09:41
AFAIK it only shows your traded volume, as others said so already. From that traded volume you have to subtract all buys, they dont calculate that in (and thats very stupid in my opinion, because it should be very easy for an exchange to calculate the profits and not the trades).
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:51:02


Are you trolling? ... BTC is not BCH. Two different coins. Like ETH and BTC... you cannot send BTC to BCH and vise versa. If you done so you need the private keys for the wallet you send to
