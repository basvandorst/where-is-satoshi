AML regulations are actually fairly lax, at least in the US. The legally mandated restrictions are:
* Send a report detailing the source and destination of any transaction over 10.00 USD
* Send a report for any transaction from accounts with known criminal links, as defined by the government
* Due diligence. This is where it gets tricky. Most institutions take this to mean that they must know the real name of their account holders, and know more or less where the incoming money is from.
The top two are fairly innocuous. 
It's the last one that people struggle with. Why should I have to provide ID to verify who I am to buy BTC with USD, or withdraw USD? Simply put, because the bank account you're transferring money out of/into wants it for their due diligence
As we're all painfully aware, MtGox, as big as it was, didn't fall under any of the regulations for financial institutions. This includes AML laws.

Good luck preventing government-backed inflation for a currency that is extremely dependent on electric power.

How is everyone having to link their name to their money in any way like forcing a specific race of people to wear distinguishing patches? I am genuiely curious as to how those two are similar to you.

The recieving bank may very well just deny all transactions from the exhange.
The exchanges own bank could also refuse service, as its ID requirements for incoming money aren't met, making it potentially liable.
I'm not really arguing the morality of AML laws, I'm more saying that it isn't exchanges that are the problem. If MtGox didn't fall under AML laws, I doubt any exhange does.

Title 3 of USA PATRIOT is probably the most relevant to the concerns over modern ID requirements.
( yes I'm citing wikipedia because most people don't want to/like to read legalese )
The law is intentionally vague, as it states that a report must also be filed when the bank has suspicion that you're trying to skirt the regulations. Entire sectors have sprung up around helping banks avoid penalties for, in the eyes of the law, not catching suspicious behaviour.

I don't exactly have the resources to set up a wind turbine, to say nothing of the fact that not all places have wind. 
To power one AntMiner S1( 180 GH/s advertised ), you would need a 4mx2m solar panel. Current estimates at the sum of all miners hashrates are 45,049,522.57 GH/s.
To meet that power demand, assuming the miner actually gets 180GH/s, you would need roughly 501100605 square kilometres of solar panels. That's right around the surface area of the earth. Solar power isn't a viable alternative either.
