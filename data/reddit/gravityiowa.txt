Etoro holds your coins for you, you don't have the private key, nor can you withdraw to your own wallet.

No. You don't need smart contracts for that, an escrow service will do. 
The advantage of smart contracts over traditional contracts is that they can be executed without a third party, such as a notary public, when the conditions of the contract are met. 
A simple example would be the sale of an .eth domain. Because the transaction is recorded in the Ethereum blockchain, no third party is needed to register the transfer of ownership. By contrast, if you buy a .com domain you have to register the change of ownership with ICANN.

Nothing is instant with Bitcoin, but transactions are quicker and cheaper if you use a segwit address. If you want to sell quickly, you'll need to keep your coins on an exchange, but of course that's much less secure.

Yes, your private keys are stored on your Ledger. However, there is a way to display your private keys using the BIP tool on the Ledger website:  (IMPORTANT: you should only use this tool on an offline computer). So, theoretically you could use your private key instead of the seed words.
Your PIN (it can be up to 8 digits) protects the Ledger device. Anyone with access to the Ledger and the PIN has access to your coins. A compromised PIN by itself does not expose you to any risk, you can always change it on the device.
Bruteforcing your PIN is essentially impossible, because the device is wiped after 3 attempts. 
If you forget your PIN, you can always recover from seed. 
The risk with using a hardware wallet mainly derives from the need to store your seed securely, i.e. protecting it from theft and destruction. Some ways of mitigating this risk is memorizing the seed phrase, storing it in a medium that is not easily destroyed (e.g. CryptoSteel), putting it in a bank vault or hiding it well. 
There are a number of wallets that support BIP-39 seed phrases, a list can be found at

AFAIK the number if words can differ, so 24 words can be a perfectly legitimate seed. A quick and dirty way to do it would be to go to  and save the page for offline access (this method is suggested on the website itself), then enter the seed with Ethernet unplugged and/or wifi off. A more secure way to do it is to boot a Linux live CD, and install the Bither wallet, one if the few software wallets which accept a 24 word seed. Then you should be able to export the private key for the address.

I am trying to read it, but the author makes sweeping, unsubstantiated claims like "Bitcoin has been chosen to replace gold standard and you can do nothing about it" or "History is driven by technical progress and technical progress is accelerating", and it's full of grammar and spelling mistakes ("Stock market will keep crashing but things really becomes different" [sic]). He claims that "Nobody understands it [Bitcoin]", and that Bitcoin is "like a ponzi scheme", which is further proof of his limited mental power and ignorance. Trust me, he's an idiot.

You can include the driver in the Linux distribution and burn it to a CD. That way your live OS never touches the internet. I haven't done it myself but Ubuntu customization kit (uck) looks like a good tool for that. You can just apt-get the packages you need, and remove the ones you don't want.

If you want redundancy, you can import the seed of one Ledger to another one. However, you might as well write down your seed / engrave it in a steel plate several times and stash them in different places to achieve the same result.

Nonsense. The main difference between cash and Bitcoin is decentralization.

"Digital Gold" is a great book, but won't tell you much about Segwit, BCH, fees or scaling, since these are debates much more recent than the time period covered by the book.

AnycoinDirect isn't cheap, but they do video identification, and once you've done that, you can buy BTC and a few alts with SEPA transfer or SOFORT. There's other payment options, but those are the two I've used in the past, and they're reliable and (relatively) fast. In case of hiccups, their customer service is quick to respond and helpful.

You got the main difference right: Bitcoin Core downloads the entire BTC blockchain, which is more than 100GB. 
I used Electrum before I moved to Ledger, and never experienced any problems with it. You keep your own keys, and after the Bitcoin Cash fork I was able to claim my BCH through Electron. I wouldn't expect any problems with the upcoming forks either.

The case of Venezuela is quite well documented, e.g. in the book "Digital Gold" by Nathaniel Popper. A currency doesn't collapse overnight, it usually dies a slow death over an extended period of time, so this gives you a window of opportunity to exchange your inflationary currency for Bitcoin. But of course you can miss this opportunity, and be left with tons of worthless units of currency.

You seem to be confused about the difference between an address, a wallet and an exchange. 
A bitcoin address (such as 1GUkazUBpXWdSJ9HbgTapAH7uybpi3Cs6K) can hold any number of BTC.
A wallet (e.g. Electrum) can hold a number of addresses, the total number of BTC at these addresses is the amount you hold in that wallet. It's best not to bother with multiple wallets, just send all your BTC to one wallet address. 
An exchange (such as Coinbase) is where you go to buy and sell BTC. If you want to withdraw your BTC from the exchange, you will have to provide an address in your wallet to receive them. 
Wallets and exchanges are similar insofar as they can both send and receive BTC. So there is no such thing as "mutually inaccessible locations". Just decide in which wallet you want to keep your BTC, and send everything there. 
Wallets and exchanges are different insofar as wallets are just a 'container' to keep your BTC, whereas exchanges are like 'banks' where you exchange one kind of money (USD) for another kind (BTC). 
tl;dr Decide on a wallet, send all BTC to that wallet. If you want to buy more, go to an exchange, and send it to your wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:48:56
Anycoindirect is another possibility, you can use sepa or sofort payments to buy BTC, Ethereum and a bunch of other cryptos. Fast verification via videochat, and good customer service. I use Bitcoin.de as well, but it feels a bit clunky, and transactions to wallet can take a long time, even with BCH.

I have to apologize, it's actually Argentina that Popper is talking about in his book. But it can probably provide some insight, considering the adoption happened much earlier there. If I remember correctly, Argentina had a lot of face to face trading, so those with access to the required technology and know-how served as "exchanges". Since you can hold Bitcoin in paper wallets, you would not need to have access to technology to hold Bitcoin.

I am sorry to say this, but if you find it so confusing you should probably stay out of Bitcoin / crypto. I'm not a coinbase user myself but most people seem to find it pretty straightforward to use. Every wallet has a 'receive' address, and every exchange has a 'withdraw' and a 'deposit' option. That's really all you need to know. The rest is copy and paste.

It looks like this is basically a rebranded version of the Keywallet Touch. 
Personally, I wouldn't trust it. Button or no, the thing about Ledger and Trezor is that their code is on github, and you can audit it yourself. 
If this isn't enough of a red flag for you, consider what happens when you lose the device. Great, you've written down your seed words, but who knows if this company will even be around in a few years time. If it doesn't use BIP-39 or another standard protocol, I wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot-pole.

I haven't really been following the topic much lately, but if the SEC allows a Bitcoin ETF, I think it's going to be one that tracks futures, rather than Bitcoin price directly, because the CBOE and the CME are regulated, while crypto exchanges are not.

Thanks, interesting. While I don't have enough expertise in cryptography to verify the viability of the transition method described, I find this bit particularly interesting: 


Considering that some miners might find it advantageous to use quantum computers, and considering how difficult it is to reach consensus about relatively simple things like block size, Segwit, Lightning etc., this has the potential to create severe disruption in the Bitcoin community, and could have drastic consequences for Bitcoin itself.

Depends on the jurisdiction. Within individual countries, they can shut down exchanges, outlaw possession and/or trade. It happened to gold ( so it could happen to Bitcoin. Internationally, I think it's pretty much impossible to kill, since it would require a large number of jurisdictions to cooperate. Very unlikely to happen. Gold's still here as well.

Short ETFs are financial instruments developed to hedge risks for holders of regular index funds. Typically, they are inverse ETFs, which go up when the index goes down (and vice versa), and some of them are leveraged by a factor of 2 or 3. 
Inverse ETFs use futures or other derivatives to achieve this goal, so buying a short ETF is not very different from buying futures, but an ETF is a consumer product, and as such it's much easier to handle than futures themselves.

It's probably worth pointing out that there are protocols that have built-in quantum resistance, such as Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL). 
QRL uses the Extended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS). An XMSS using SHA-256 is predicted to provide protection against brute-force attacks until the year 2164.
