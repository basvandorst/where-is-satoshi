From my understanding, may be changes for 2018, is that you need to keep track of every transaction you do now.. Even if moving from one coin to another. Anything that gives you a "Profit" you have to track and keep record..
Here is a nice video that explains it...

Well what are you mining first of all? Many people use Celerons CPU in their Rigs cause it is cheap as the GFX cards are doing the mining, not the CPU. As long as you have sufficient power to the cards, everything should be ok.
If you are doing BTC mining..Why? You will gain nothing with that power.. You are better off mining Ethereum with the 1070's or some other Alt Coin..

RamTheKing - In 6 months? You sure you didn't hear on mining a different coin and then convert to Bitcoin? For example on Nicehash, you can mine..lets say Monero..Then as you mine, Nicehash will auto exchange it for you into Bitcoin... Now in that situation I can see doing $6 in a day or 2. Mining Pool Hub will do the same thing but on there you can tell what coin you want.
WhatToMine shows on avg about $4 per day with two 1070's..not counting any fees and electric..
You prob best to do Ethereum as this coin so far has the best loss ratio over the other coins..

If you purchase, you should of purchase on what you didn't mind losing.. Like going to the casino.. Don't take in more than what you can afford to lose..
