And back down to 16.9.  That was a fun little spike.

If that's a serious question, then I'll answer. 
For every transaction, there is 1 buyer and 1 seller. Or, possibly, one person is just moving money around between two wallets they own. But excluding that, it would mean one person sold, and another person bought. 
When you buy gas (or gold, or silver, or a hamburger) there is 1 buyer and 1 seller.

coinbase is simply acting as a payment processor, the same way you might swipe a visa or mastercard (which you may have noticed is not cash) and those companies will give the business your money in a form they can use.

The problem isn't that you're using the term market cap. The problem is that you seem to think the market cap matters, when what matters is how much overstock is making in profits. 


I'm not sure if you're suggesting its nothing to be excited about because 1/8000th of the currency is not enough, or if the $8-billion "market cap" is too small to notice.  If you mean the former, though, then by that logic, if a company made $1 billion dollars profit in a currency that has a $8 trillion m1 money supply, that's nothing to be excited about. Clearly it is. That's still $1 billion in the pocket of the company. 
Imagine your business is operating in a small country like Latvia. If you happened to do business equal to 1/8000th of the entire country's money supply, that's pretty amazing, and absolutely nothing to sneer at. 
Another user mentioned that this is an increase in sales of 1% over their previous business. An increase of 1% for a large mature business is actually very very good.  
And what's more important isn't that they increased it 1% in the first month, but that the rate of spending is going up. They reached the $1m mark faster than they expected. If bitcoin continues to grow in acceptance, and overstock is known as the company with good products that accepts btc, that number could jump to 2%, or 3%. 
Their stock is up 10% today. Increases in sales have a huge effect for a company. If a company's first 70% of sales is just covering their costs (headquarters, warehouse, etc), then an increase of 1% actually increases their profit around 3%.  If, as said before, btc becomes 3% of their sales, that could increase their profits by 10%. 
These are not small numbers.

He wasn't asking about the disparity between smart people who lose bitcoins and smart people who don't lose them.

But he wasn't making a point. He was asking a question.

I feel if Mark had simply hired someone to set up a proper front-running of their clients (as horrible as that sounds), they could have easily skimmed enough off every trade to eventually make everything back.  This could have simply been hidden for a long time behind "bad fills" or other small market-making language, and it could have led to the company coffers filling up again. 
I have no idea why he didn't do something like that much earlier.

If bitcoins (and their 'brokers' like mtgox) want btc to be a legitimate pseudo-currency, then it needs to be able to handle real trade volumes. In equity markets, almost all traders are small blocks, blocks of 100, etc. If mtgox can't figure out how to handle that type of volume, then they have a problem. Putting limits on how often people can sell btc is not a real solution.

consider scaling in or out when prices seem ridiculous. For example, if you had even sold 1/10th of your coin at $1000 you'd have your original investment back and safe and the rest would all be play money
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:23:35


There is no expense to the market. The market will fall if there are more sellers than buyers. It does not matter at all if the sellers are selling in units of 1btc or 10 btc. 
The only problem is mtgox can't seem to handle real trading and they're pretending to be a trading platform.

it is obviously excellent news. If the government came in and said "btc? whats that? We're not going to help with this investigation" then that's bad news. If the government comes in and says "yes, your property was stolen, and we will investigate it and bring them to justice" then that's good news.

You could double your money in a day by using call / put options on common equities

The government will not be able to 'prevent' anything. They'll only be able to punish after the fact. Anyone can still put a wallet on a USB and leave the country with all their money and never come back to China, purchase citizenship in some european country, or whatever.

He didn't try to pick the top, or the bottom. He sold at $900 (not near the top) and bought back at $650 (not near the bottom). He seemed content to have made $250/btc, and does not seem to be stressing about whether he picked a top or a bottom.

Those are problems 'now'. Many products / services / innovations do not emerge from incubation perfected in every way. This is why people would often not buy new technology, huge flatscreen tvs, dvd players, or video game consoles as soon as they came out. There would be bugs, and the service will get better / cheaper / more efficient in the future.   But early adopters often do get a first-mover's advantage in developing the infrastructure surrounding the technology.

Dumbest thing i ever read. Obviously you can still list prices in usd, and next to it, have a screen listing current exchange rate.

... then he loses money... same as if you have automatic buys on a stock and it continues falling.
