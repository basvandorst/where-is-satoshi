The only rich person who has significant amount of fiat is Floyd Mayweather. The other rich people keep all their wealth in assets mostly stocks or real estate.

So is bitcoin.

I mean I can lose crypto in countless ways that do not affect my bank account. Holding all my money in a bank account I just have to worry about government and bank itself. Holding all my money in crypto means I have to worry about volatility, hackers, fraud exchanges. The list goes on. Things that happen in crypto are impossible in regular finance world. Such as a whole exchange telling you they cannot give you your money because founder is dead and he only one who has access to the keys, exchange taking money from your account because some other trader executed a stupidly bad trade. Moreover, if someone steals my crypto that money is gone forever with banks I have recourse.

Yeah, I love my 401k.

Few Americans have pensions.  401k is a replacement for it. It's a tax advantage investment account.

Yes, that requires a full market collapse, worse what's going with bitcoin right now. Is it impossible? No. But we will all be in deep shit if it happens.

The only time you can lose your 401k legally is when you owe unpaid taxes and penalties to IRS. Yes, you get a penalty for early withdrawal, but you can still do it.

Do you trade your bitcoin yourself or through a large exchange such as coinbase? If you do it yourself you better do all proper verifications otherwise feds might look at you for money laundering charges, if you do it through an exchange you're at mercy of 3d parties like myself.
