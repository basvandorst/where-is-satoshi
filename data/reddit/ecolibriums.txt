Which regulations are they not repealing that they should be repealing? (I mean besides all of them...)

I do not live in rural America, although sometimes I do miss that peace and quiet. Don't need no city to enjoy my internet! For now:/

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a fork off of bitcoin that took place in August. The protocol is similar to the current iteration of bitcoin in every way (now that Segwit 2x has been put in the cooler), but has a larger block size, which means 8x more transactions can fit into a unit block. The most important ramification to BCH users is that transaction fees are significantly lower. I'm in no way a pusher of BCH, but the larger block size has had a nonlinear impact on transaction fees, i.e., transaction costs are ~$5 for moving BTC in comparison to BCH tx costs of pennies. In their current state and given market dynamics, BTC's primary utility seems to be as a store of value, whereas BCH's primary utility is as a medium of exchange.

Coinbase handles transactions on their own private ledger like all exchanges. This means they don't actually transact the Bitcoin on the blockchain for every sale. That would be extremely slow and expensive. This makes it possible for people to make all sorts of quick trades. It's an arbitrager's wet dream!

Can we meme this post? 
And putting this tip in my next webinar series on trading crypto tactics. (Only $500 for 3 two minute videos.) *Thanks*

I'm a big crypto advo, but as an aside, it's amazing how this reinforces the argument that technology doesn't solve the worlds ills the way we want it to. When someone has 4G and can watch his favorite soap or futball team, but can't afford to put food on his table unless he bikes for days is kind of nuts. Still waiting for that helicar...

Getting on the bitwagon. It's hard researching this tech to be fair, when it takes 2 to 3 years to wrap your head around computer sci throwing in a dash of rudimentary cryptography.

This is amazing! Guess I'm waiting for the lux model with leather seats and 6-disc CD changer.

There are many potential futures where bitcoin isn't relevant. Tech at the client level has such little friction, that any protocol that solves bitcoin's pain points can rocket past it. And if the "core" guys don't move faster (a lot faster), there is lots of cause to worry. The price won't plummet immediately because of another kind of friction, investor psychology and stubbornness, which the btc devs are really starting to take advantage of. Who knows how much longer they can get away with it.
