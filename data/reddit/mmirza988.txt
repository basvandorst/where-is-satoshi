You see the thing with bitcoin is that it needs mainstream adoption so that it can be considered as a possible replacement of cash in the future. What I mean is public figures and corporations have to steadily start adopting it.

He doesn't know anything about the technology powering bitcoin but when I asked him when it would be possible to buy a cup of coffee from starbucks using bitcoin he said never for the simple fact that the governments won't allow it to go mainstream and banks power corporations and they wont let these corporations offer BTC as a means of payment. If you think about it, only small, hippie downtown coffee shops offer BTC as a means of payment.
