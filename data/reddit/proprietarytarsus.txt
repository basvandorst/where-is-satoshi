I don't think they are Segwit - which is really a bit crap considering they're supposed to support BTC.  Should start with a 3 I think.  My Trezor fully supports Segwit, and if you buy a new one it is automatic.

I honestly don't think you can analyse Cryptos in the traditional ways - it is so new that it is completely unpredictable.  If in doubt, hold.  I've done nothing with my 5.2 BTC over the years - and made a reasonable amount of  money.

You can have a 25th word in your recovery seed - known only to you.  So you can disclose all of your passwords and recovery seed - but without the passphrase it will just open an empty account.  You could put a few cents in the empty one if you wish - you would , I assume, have given full disclosure.  See the TREZOR website for further details about preventing a forced disclosure of an account.  Cool little device.

I've been a bit rattled by the surge of Shitcash, but there are definitiely scaling issues with BTC. However, Shitcash is just a hard fork, and if you own BTC you own all of them. 
So the question is: is Shitcash the best version ever -
unlikely.  If you sell your proper BTC you will lose out on all future hardforks.  As well as the slightly longer term likelihood of BTC introducing LN and other solutions.  After a great deal of thought, I actually bought  more BTC during Shitcash's silly rise - on this basis. Disclaimer: I'm invested in BTC to the tune of tens of thousands - but I bought years ago.  I just hold them.  (p.s. since August you would have lost out on Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond - not worth much, but no different in principle to Shitcash.  Don't forget Bitcoin GOD!  There is even a 'Bitcoin Cash Plus' in the offing - prob wank, but as a BTC holder you receive the benefit of all these hard forks..) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:52:07
It is definitely going to either go down the pan, hold, slowly increase, slowly decline or go to the moon!  Of that I am certain.  I'll just keep hold of my 5.2 BTC as I have for 5 years.  (And cash in on free coins from future crappy hard-forks like BCash.)
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:43:23
It will almost certainly show up - at least the 'unconfirmed' transaction is showing in your wallet.  It will be fine.

It is the original crypto.  Don't forget BCash, aka Shitcoin, is simply a fork of it.  What does a Shitcoin owner do when a better fork arrives?  This is what I do - I get 1:1 from the fork, whilst waiting for BTC to sort out issues caused BY IT'S SUCCESS!  Did you know there is a Bitcoin Cash Plus fork coming - ho ho - you won't get that from your fake alt shitcoin..

If the correction is due to a hard-fork (Shitcoin Wank), it doesn't matter, as we get all these hard-forks for free.  Why would Wankcoin Shit be better than those in future?  Think about it.  It is like saying Walmart Cola is the same as Coca Cola.  Heh..

Just keep your BTC.  Hard-forks are delivered from it, with free coins, like Shitcoin Cash.  There will be better hard-forks, and you get the coins for free.  And BTC will upscale eventually.  It has a massive market dominance, and is untainted by individual greed.  Just hold on.  That's what I have done for years.  I lost 30k the last few days - but I'm still 70k up on the year!

No.  Because, for example, Shitcoin Cash is just a hard-fork, and there will be many more.  But they all hard-fork from the only truly decentralised and original cryptocurrency.  I think that BTC is facing some real challenges, partly due to its success!  But when scaling is sorted buyers will flock back into the fold.  Even given its huge difficulties, it is still holding above 13k - there is some trust and resilience there.  Also, BTC holders get all these shitcoin hard-forks for free.  I wouldn't say the future looks rosy, but we need to think on a longer timescale that 5 days.  All the best and kind regards and a Merry Xmas.

Luckily it only moves in a 2D Cartesian plane - sideways, or up and down.  Actually, that is 1D assuming the sideways movement is always in the direction of time.  So up or down, with a bit of jiggling.  I don't care, I'm keeping mine.  BCash is just another hard-fork, there will be others - some better, but they are all based on BTC, and you get the coins free.  Don't be a wimp!

Do you mean Shitcoin Wank?  Well of course it is.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:48:12
I agree,  BTC is the gold standard, but for BCash to claim that it is superior because it is fast is absurd - there are other cryptocoins that can claim the same or higher speeds.  My principal objection to BCash is the sheer dishonesty of the co-opting of the brand - I have no problem with Litecoin, because it doesn't claim the same.  I do think Ver and his cronies are a busted flush now, but they don't care, they've made their killing.  I hope the noobs who believe in Shitcoin Cash will hodl and watch it decline relatively.

Everyone forgets the FORKS from this dominant cryptocurrency!  Sh*teCoin C*sh was just a hard-fork.  There are many more to come, and it is likely they are better - assuming the future holds more than the present.  Are all BTC holders going to cash out everytime free coins are available from people trying to distort the democracy of the market?  Keep you PROPER coins - and remember that if you sell out to Sh*teCoin C*sh, you will get no further hard forks for free.  It is just not logical people.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:58:00
IMO, BCash / Sh*iteCoin Cash will settle at perhaps 0.1 to 0.15 BTC.  Until the next hard-fork comes along which is better, and adopt Shi*teCoin Cash's position.  Meanwhile, BTC will serenely keep climbing in value.  Trust me - I'm an astrophysicist!  :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:13:24
Bitcoin Cash was given free to all BTC owners in a 1:1 ratio, because it is a 'hard-fork'.  There have been several, but you must hold BTC. 
 Coinbase has yet to release all these free BCH coins to their users - the Shitcoin price will collapse when it does.  This is why Conbase sold it before it released it.

Keep the BTC.  Shitcoin Cash is just a hard fork from it.  There are, and will be many others, some better.  You'll likely only get free forks holding the original and best.  I'll keep my Coca Cola rather than cash out for Tesco cola.

It's good that some devs are essentially taking the piss out of Shitcoin Cash like this.  Bitcoin God will be a hard-fork that is just as valid!  There's also BUM - Bitcoin Uranium, but that is prob just a wind up.

You can't have profits without risks.  I feel quite confident in BTC and am perfectly happy to hold.

Because Shitcoin Cash is just another hard-fork, that we all get for free, including Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, the upcoming Bitcoin God!  And many others.  Difference is that, unlike other reasonably honest hard-forks, Shitcoin Cash stole the logo, and Dodgy Vershit even pretends it is BTC.  There are many buyers who actually think it is BTC - well it is not.

What I mean is that all BTC holders on, I think, 1 Aug 2017 received free an identical number of wankcash cash - but Coinbase hasn't released it to them.  I wonder why...

Well. No matter what the qualities of your crypto, that is demonstrably false - isn't it?  Because there are now several Bitcoin forks from Bitcoin. So either they are all Bitcoin, or one is Bitcoin.  Ergo, it is not one of the forks.   Indiscriminately logical wanker like Ver. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:48:14
If only king BTC were a company - it would have paid shills and sock-puppets.  Unfortunately it's only got free independent people like myself, who fundamentally despise dishonesty.  For example, the dishonesty behind the stealing of brands perpetrated by convicted criminals like Ver and his Shitcoin Cash.

Some advice.  Send a tiny amount.  Back up the wallet with its passphrase.  Delete the wallet.  Check you can recover it.    Do it again, check you can recover it again.  Then just send the whole lot.  I always make a not of the first 2 and last 2 symbols of addresses to check everything.

Extremely unlikely to be a scam; but it is a little confusing.  Certainly not as much as a scam as Bcash, so if you're invested in that - if you're already soaking wet, you might as well jump back in the river.

Within a, still relatively small, world like the cryptocurrencies - in its nascent stages, credibility is everything.  What has happened in the past week or so has been a huge loss of credibility for a set of people: Roger Ver, Coinbase and its leadership and CNBC.  It is unlikely they will ever recover from this.

I like the look of this man.  The fact that he sold agricultural explosives illegally and received a 10 month prison sentence in the USA doesn't bother me.  I am perfectly happy to transfer my significant holdings in a trusted democratised Crypto, i.e. BTC, to his crypto - which is called Shitcoin Cash is fine with me.  After all, this convicted criminal claims that Bcash IS BTC - which is legally and demonstrably untrue.  But never mind.  I believe him.  I just wish I could give him and Conbase more money.  P.S.  He has gone rather quiet recently - where is he?
