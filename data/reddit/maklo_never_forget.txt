Just stop bring poor please. It annoys me.
@_date: 2014-03-23 13:28:00
What does that mean?:p
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:22:19
Well from what i've read at  ''he'' can 
''Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.''
But I dont have a clue on how to pull that off and why are people so worried if noone seems to be able to explain on how to pull that off?
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:06:18
We'll there are more than enough user provided content and informative websites that both report different stories and opinions so I don't know what you're exactly trying to point out with that comment.
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:48:12
I really am not downvoting anyone.. I rarely downvote..
Thank you for the assumption though.

Heroin in mdma pills in the netherlands? 
So they are cutting up pills with stuff thats more expensive than the product they are trying to sell it as?
@_date: 2014-03-22 22:44:07
Trust me, the bitcoins are from a top quality dutch press &lt;3

Thank you for this.
Attacker has a lot of computing power
An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows him to:
Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
How is that possible though, why are they able to do that?
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:03:12
Hmm okay, so why are websites reporting that if they reach 51 they can possibly dupe with bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:20:34
How exactly would that be possible?
@_date: 2014-03-24 07:45:50
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:59:40
Thank you so much for this! ;) Really explains a lot.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:47:33
So this thread or subreddit basically consists of people contradicting eachother?
@_date: 2014-03-23 09:17:42
I don't think you understand how cheap MDMA is in the Netherlands, for 1kilo you pay about 6000euro, 50kilos can be bought for as cheap as 3500/kilo.
It is pretty hard to find pma pills in the Netherlands to be honest.
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:31:50
The problem was solved... Not by speeding up the process, though, the company cleared the transaction without confirmations, like I mentioned before.
@_date: 2017-02-03 21:06:07
@_date: 2017-02-01 14:34:01
I was able to pay my car in time since the company make an exception and released the funds to me without confirmations on the block chain.

Not that I like PayPal that much but one of the reason they do it is to counter money laundering 
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:07:32
Just PM me your private keys and I will add it!

Can someone Tl;Dr this or is there a thread somewhere that explains everything that has happened?
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:40:51
Thanks! This explains it pretty good! Damn interesting as well haha.
@_date: 2017-01-30 08:09:50
Hey sorry! I called the payment provider and asked them what I should do, he told me normally they don't make the bank transfer before 3 confirmations but he would make an exception this time, so all was good!:) thanks!
@_date: 2017-01-24 08:01:36
What kind of magic is that exactly and how does that work? Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:12:59




Those are the parts that I dont understand haha
@_date: 2017-01-24 08:03:02
Blockchain, it was the recommended fee I assume, I never change any of the information and never had any problems like this. I talked to the people cashing out my money and they just confirmed to cash out the money without the confirmations, so a big yay for them!
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:58:24
Yes that's definitely another take from it as well! I think what may be considered misleading here is the use of the word "banknotes" in the title.
@_date: 2019-08-11 15:01:39
To me this picture suggests that people would rather throw money away/do not care to pick it up because the money is worthless. This is *almost* true except for the fact that the notes you see are not *money* anymore since it got replaced by a new currency.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:38:32
haha nice
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:35:56
There are filters for that.
