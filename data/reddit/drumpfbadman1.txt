There are a number of OTC platforms that will directly match up large orders with buyers/sellers.
If you search "best Bitcoin OTC" you can find some articles discussing pros/cons of each.

That's what large scale batteries are for.

Wow you really have a lot invested in shilling for Twitter and defending them any time someone doesn't outright praise and fellate them like you are.
Totally not the actions of a super obvious shill PR bot though.

Hi Twitter PR, thanks for that completely meaningless and empty propaganda statement.
It's *exceedingly weird* when people like you pop out of the woodwork to unconditionally defend the actions of corporations. No normal person does that. Only paid whores do.

Or they'll hedge using futures or some other method. 
I don't think we've seen any significant pullback on hash rate even since the last bull run, so people are either not turning off miners or are replacing them with more efficient miners.

I'm not arguing with an obviously paid Twatter shill, you mong. Plus, I never even made an argument, because you don't have a point, just Twitter's propaganda spewing from your gaping mouth like diarrhea.

There are two camps of people who make Bitcoin predictions, IMO. Those who are in it as a speculation vehicle and see it as a neat idea but little more, and on the other hand you have futurists who are looking at the whole, long term big picture. 
The second camp are where the huge and outrageous predictions are coming from, but they'll also have more reasonable near term predictions in general because they aren't viewing Bitcoin as just a sort of distributed stock, and instead understand at least some of the technology and the innovation that technology represents.

Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh shill, cry more.

Yes. The only thing you can lose is a Reddit account. This place is like boomer AOL Internet these days so not a huge loss.

Insane that your shilling and revolting gaslighting is getting upvoted at all.

It's pretty out of date as an idea now though considering the state of South Africa and India. I guess this was still when they were actively propping up those countries with tons of taxpayer dollars.

How quickly people forget Twittergate (i.e., how Twitter *banned* the guy who exposed and reported to the FBI/Twitter over 10k pedo image accounts on their platform, on which they took no action).
