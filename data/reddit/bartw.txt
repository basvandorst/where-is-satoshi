Wow. Do you have any reference for these 'even worse' problems?

World moves on, innovations, better work performance, etc. etc. It should be easier to live day-by-day for everyone? If US is so strong then why so many people live there on benefits or are homeless / live in tents?
Future generations will have to pay for today's prosperity. Its debt. Or we are already starting paying it off.

I don't judge his reasons or intentions.
But he put this in post title: "LocalBitcoins -- How to Avoid their Scams". It is not their scam.

On another hand - I totally understand and DO NOT sympathise.
OP was lured by a scammer to make transaction off site. Most likely scammer proposed better price (to "avoid lbc fees" or something). Now the guy is accusing LocalBitcoins of wrong doing when he was violating rules due to his greed.

What value do you want from Reddit post? Free satoshis?
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:38:37
But you were provided with payment details by LBC. It is clear, big letters, black and white messege
@_date: 2019-01-26 00:08:22
1 satoshi worth 100 dollars. Dont thin in dollars! hahahahah Reeeee when did you switch of your brain?

Can anyone predict who will get the reward? No. Random, but it doesn't mean each have equal chance.
@_date: 2019-01-09 23:22:59
Not true, when the scammer was able to message you, at this point you were provided with payment details by LBC. There is no external communication necessary.
I mean, I feel for you, but one needs to be 1000x more careful in crypto industry than anywhere else.

Could you elaborate - how, in your opinion, banks are making the price go down?
