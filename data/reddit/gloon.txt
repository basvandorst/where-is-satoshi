I'll wait after the fork when people move their btc to alts and things stabilise a bit. But first I have to save some fiat.

I don't think so. Save that tip for your trip.

I'm rooting for you!

I'll pass on the compliment from a stranger to her. Thanks man!

This is my mom. The most wonderful and caring mother someone could have. She turned 60. She had hard times in her life and always put others before herself. A year ago I replaced most of my savings for 0.5 BTC and sold it this week to fullfill my mother's biggest wish. Trip to New York. She was the happiest person in the world. Tears were everywhere. We travel in spring. If someone had told me a year ago I'd be able to take my mother to NY freshly after my graduation I would've laughed. Thank you BTC. I'm saving money again and buying!
