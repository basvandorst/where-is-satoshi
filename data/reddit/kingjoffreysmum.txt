I’ve used Breadwallet for a while now; no issues at all.

I work with a guy who originates from Zimbabwe, and he said that everyone back home was buying Bitcoin because their dollar now means nothing. He said his 72 year old mother was asking for instructions on how to set up a wallet.

I’m not a vet, I’ve researched it the past year and then bought in October. I didn’t buy loads, only what I can afford to lose. I’m viewing it as a fun little hobby rather than anything else. It passes the time, and on bad days at work, it gives me something to daydream about. That’s actually worth quite a lot to me.

No. Because she’s still in Zimbabwe, and Bitcoin means something as a currency. The Zimbabwe dollar does not.

I use breadwallet. Seems pretty decent.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:10:57
Nah. I bought in at £4.4k, with only what I could afford to lose. I’ve certainly wasted more on far worse!

When a million hodlers buy it again. There are so, so many of us waiting for a dip to buy into. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:12:10
...when there will be thousands of people ready and waiting to buy more/ buy in. I know, I’m one of them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:14:09
No. You still have the same amount of bitcoin; that never changes unless you sell some of it. It might be worth less than you paid for it though. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:43:01
Exactly. I bought a similar amount at a similar price myself. If it crashes? I’ll buy the crash (and I bet thousands of others will too) and oh look, the price goes back up. I didn’t pump life savings into it; just a little bit to play around with.

I’ve got 11.5% of 1 BTC. I can’t imagine the price will ever be that high. My husband is teasing me about my tiny little holding and telling me it’s all a waste of time :-/
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:53:45
Exactly. Waiting is riskier. Of course, there will always be the scenarios where people successfully ‘buy the dips’ but that really is a gamble.

I think so too. I think alt coins are definitely worth a punt right now if you can afford to lose the money (although that goes without saying; seeing people commenting and saying they’ve put everything they have into Bitcoin is scary IMO).
BTC just dropping from £5.5k - £5.1k in less than an hour, and ETH and LTC had the briefest upturn in that time. Could be coincidental of course.

Thank you for taking the time to get back to me.
This is what I was reading, and the way I interpreted it was that Bread don’t want to pick a side, and will go with whichever node you’re on at the time, and if there are more Segwit2x nodes; then you’re getting transferred to that. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:25:49
Thank you for that. I’m reading as much as I can online about all this, but some things are still confusing to a newb... hence why I’ve not bought that much! 
I’d like to keep it in the wallet though because I hold the key; I’ve heard horror stories about keeping holdings on the exchanges. 
So am I correct in thinking that on the day of the fork; I’ll be credited with an equal amount of Segwit2x if I just leave it in the wallet and do nothing?
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:49:31
I bought at £4400 and people were starting threads cracking jokes about people who were ‘only just getting in now’.  Now it’s more than double that and those same people are trotting out the same lines. 
If you think it’s worth it, and you can stand to lose that 2.5k if it turned to nothing tomorrow; then do it. Never invest what you can’t afford to lose. You could also look at splitting it across Eth, BTC and LTC to spread your risk and have a wider portfolio. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:56:19
This is true. Maybe this saved you; maybe you would have spent it all on drugs and overdosed or something. It’s imaginary money because for you; it never existed.

I also use Bread for iOS, it seems fast and convenient. Make sure you’re ready with a pen and paper to write down the paper key though!
