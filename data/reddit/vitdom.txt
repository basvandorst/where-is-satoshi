I sure wonder why organizations and security research companies hand out public ECC-curves and say "Here you are, this is a good and secure curve!"
They are perfectly correct that those curves are good and secure but if everyone uses them, then everyones' security would suffer from a broken curve. Why would anyone encourage the public to start using ONE or only A FEW curves?
They're even naming the curves, even NIST has named their curves after their own agency's name. Because it's a stamp of approval and sign of safety.

Bitcoin is fundamentally flawed and insecure, because it relies on Elliptic Curve Cryptography, which is also fundamentally flawed and insecure.
It relies on the Discrete Logarithm Problem which is secure but this security is broken with the implementation of DLP in ECC.
The security flaw lies in the use of the SAME CURVE over a finite field(Galois fields).
People always ask, "Is this curve secure?"
The answer is: Only if it is random, and unused by others.

Sorry, you can't fix this. If I were you I'd sell my bitcoins before someone decides to crash it.

In other words, crack the curve and you've cracked everything that's encrypted with it.
Cracking the curve involves unfolding and expanding the finite field in an 3rd dimension, mapping every solution to the curve in a space. Effectively eliminating the DLP in the Elliptic Curve Logarithm Problem in finding k in Q=kP given Q &amp; P. This requires a NSA supercomputer but is very much possible.
