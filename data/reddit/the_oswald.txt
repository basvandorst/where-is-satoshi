Hey there! Thanks for your work on bringing information to the masses! I'd also like to throw my hat in the ring for assistance. I have a body of music, instrumental and otherwise you're welcome to use. 
If you're interested, I'll PM you the information!

First off, thanks for Honey. I haven't saved a penny with it but I've saved lots of time.
Secondly, incorporating Bitcoins seamlessly into common processes is exactly what the market needs.

Awesome. I've been looking at ways to take bitcoin for digital downloads for a couple weeks now. I hope this happens soon.

I heard this too, but I assume it was a joke.

Things like this will (hopefully) add more and more value to BTC. Thank you!
