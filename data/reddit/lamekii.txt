Even if I fucked up, Its still my money and a response on whether its frozen, awaiting processing or whatever is all I want. A non response with no deposit or refund is not fair.

I wish I had tested first before making the deposit but I trusted them because they are a big exchange. A mistake on my end. I have deposited money with Coinbase and I have never had issues with them.

I had not thought about contacting my bank. I will call them and see if I can get my issue resolved that way. I actually want to use the money for my house so I need it back or at least know where it is. 
That money had been sitting in my account for over 9 Months so even a government investigation will show that those are my personal saving built over time of saving not just money from thin air. And no I do not have a weird last name. I pay taxes, have a regular 9-5 job etc. No way would I qualify to be flagged and even if I was it would be a no brainer that I am clean.

I passed their enhanced verification and if they are investigating or whatever It would be great to be told. The money was wire transferred from my bank. 
I have not received any responses from them and that is what is worrying because they have MY money and I do not know what is happening. I have tried to contact them and initially an agent named Jordan responded but since then, its been silence.

They do if its a wire transfer from your bank.
