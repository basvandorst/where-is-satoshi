I don’t think the point is to pretend to be something we’re not - our plans are very clear about what we expect to be during 2016/2017. That said, your comment about hostility is noted and not unexpected.

Thanks, I’ve really enjoyed this conversation and hope we can continue it over a beer some time. Reddit is not ideal for anything nuanced.

I have an invite, most likely, but currently unconfirmed. I’ll be in Milan next week. I suspect that the second question would be best for a second beer.

The intention was to use the quick survey as a reality check against what we thought to do with the Foundation. The responses have been very helpful to help us prioritize our programs and avoid areas where we wouldn’t be playing a useful function. I’ll share more information on our specific plans in the next week or two. 
Until then, I’d appreciate it if you would keep an open mind - you and I are both trying to do what we can to make Bitcoin successful and as much as what the Foundation did or didn’t do in the past is not your fault, it isn’t mine either.

Thanks for your comments so far, but I doubt we’re going to agree with each other on this.

I appreciate that, thanks. I expect that we’ll repair relationships with the community here over time, if we get on with doing useful work. The name change is something that the board considered and decided against at this time. The board was reconstituted and a new ED (me) was brought in to make a clean start.

That’s fair - judge whether or not I’m a bullshitter a year from now based on what is achieved for the benefit of BTC between now and then.

Thanks, you're welcome
