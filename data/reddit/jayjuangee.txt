The first half your post makes sense, but the second half does not.
I think that the a major point of the OP is that any of us can choose a relatively conservative percentage of our investment value into bitcoin (between 1% and 10% is relatively conservative), and sure 1% or 2% is further on the conservative end of the spectrum, but 1) it could add up to a lot of money for a person who has been investing all of his/her life and my have accumulated a decent sized investment portfolio and 2) it might seem like a large investment if you don't have a lot of faith in bitcoin (personally I believe that these kinds of investment principles are mostly sound when it comes to bitcoin, and the vast majority of other cryptos are gambles that require more gambling strategies rather than longer term investment strategies) .
Whether you are young or old, you can still consider this whole bitcoin investment matter in terms of percentages, and what percentage is comfortable for you and your own situation finances, including views about bitcoin, risk profile and timeline.
Actually, a differentiation point about younger people is that based on time, they are likely to be able to afford to engage in a bit more risk, but that factor does not mean that they should jump whole hog into it, so perhaps instead of being 10% invested as the max, they might go as high as 30% - and they may even devolve a bit into other riskier investments, such as other cryptos, but I would not recommend more than 10% of the total crypto into alts... at least 90% should be in bitcoin (and that is risky enough).
