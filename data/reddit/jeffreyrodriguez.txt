Not at first, you'd have to find an efficient path through the network.
Having a mesh doesn't preclude backbone links either.
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:55:04
Problem for who?
@_date: 2014-05-02 19:03:37
FWIW OpenMarket is a major SMS gateway.
@_date: 2014-09-30 23:20:05
I've been mulling plans for something like that.
@_date: 2014-04-30 04:35:42
No, there's just nothing wrong with financial privacy. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:15:53


Works pretty well for the USD.
@_date: 2015-01-10 17:07:45
I too wonder about AWS and NSLs. 
@_date: 2012-11-08 02:30:19
I don't know about Gabon, but many small countries don't run their own registry. It would probably be up to the registrar(s) to get this sorted out, failing that, probably the registry.
@_date: 2012-05-11 01:19:00
My thoughts exactly. 
@_date: 2012-10-16 22:03:50
It should probably be subject to an otherwise undue level of scrutiny, but it's not *necessarily* tainted.

Fools and their money.

A [Fisch]( makes coins pretty easy to verify. One Fisch can last a lifetime.
@_date: 2012-12-04 21:10:15
Does this guy have a YouTube page?
@_date: 2012-11-07 23:31:12
Possibly, seeing as the registrars could pretty easily fix that.
@_date: 2012-09-28 02:48:45
Sure, but those rates have got to be astronomical at first. A bitcoin bank would have to do a lot of work to protect their assets.
@_date: 2015-09-11 07:43:52
To be fair, this is typical voter behaviour. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:44:14
That's because it's a social trend. People are basically the same now as they were thousands of years ago.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:17:49
How long ago was the last crash? 
@_date: 2013-11-11 05:11:59
It's the same distance, and you're no closer ;)
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:13:13
I'm talking about the price, not gox.

Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt
Get you some learning, because whoever you've been reading is a liar or a fool.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:45:03
"Cheap" for me is after it falls under $20. I'm certainly not holding up that bubble.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:47:29
Anytime you think you can't lose, you're in danger of losing.
I think Bitcoin probably has a bright future, but that future may be a ways off. Especially if it starts to seriously threaten the nation state paradigm.
@_date: 2013-05-23 05:23:12
Right? And what a fucking asshole that prosecutor was to question it in the first place. 
@_date: 2013-01-05 17:29:11
Psst... you're being manipulated... and you're defending for your manipulator.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:13:39
Bitcoins are well within the AnCap wheelhouse if you want to swing by and chat us up.
Some will shoot you down, but we're a pretty good bunch round that sub.
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:26:37
Follow the money: who stands to benefit?
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:07:13
Pet peeve.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:46:07
What makes you say that?
@_date: 2013-10-05 00:19:56
There sure are a lot of parallels.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:50:35
Why not? It was lower before the mania. It'll go even lower now.
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:06:53
@_date: 2013-01-18 23:37:03
A "cash" industry probably. Good for them.
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:10:49
Come visit sometime, I think you'd dig it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:29:14
If they just started, they just got burned. Hard. Most are not likely to come back immediately.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:14:47
I don't think you've missed out on your opportunity to fleece the stupid. It's still going.
@_date: 2013-02-16 17:28:55
Most US Americans do.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:37:49
... as cash.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:49:41
A running of the fools.
@_date: 2013-05-29 13:52:16
I love me some implications.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:10:40
The USD, for all it's problems, is a lot bigger than Bitcoin at the moment. If the USD doubled in price over the course of a month, I'd be wary of jumping into that mess too. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:54:29
3pence, format them like this (slash R slash sub) and it'll autolink.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:37:26
Don't you love their math?
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:53:32
Around they treat "Anarchism" as a trademarked term, like nobody else could ever call themselves an anarchist and *possibly* mean something different from non-propertarian left-anarchy.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:52:17
Right on.
@_date: 2013-01-05 18:31:48
Rush is using people like you.
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:28:08
New accounts don't necessarily translate into a higher price.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:07:01
Not a bad idea ;)

No exploit was necessary, you gave the malware everything it needed. Whether you're aware of it or not.
@_date: 2013-10-05 00:19:03
I think we should assume TPM has backdoors.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:21:16
Mainstream? Like my dad, mom, and retired neighbors?
That may happen one day, but BTC will have had many popped bubbles by then and many other investments would have been much better.

Expect counter-intelligence propaganda.

I'm not proposing a fixed money supply, and I don't think Hazlitt was either.
Additionally, money doesn't just sit there forever, it will circulate or be replaced.

Amazing to see mania happening live.

You're probably going to kick yourself if you buy at $200, too.
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:37:02


Ad hominem doesn't tend to get very far in that sub. I'm sure people *have* attacked you (there's riffraff in any sub), but I'd be surprised if it were upvoted very much. If you engage with them, that's on you :)
Anyway, I suppose my point is that many of us are Bitcoin fans even if our ideas of property don't jive.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:58:32
Don't be *too* greedy :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:33:21
While those things may be in the cards for BTC (or its progeny) I really don't think it's there yet. I do not believe that this is adoption driven pricing; rather it *screams* mania.
I could be missing the boat here, as I don't presently own any BTC, but I'm not going to lose my ass on a tremendously risky bet, either.
@_date: 2013-12-28 08:59:26
 They're just full of shit. Bitcoin scares the daylights out of them.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:57:02
Roughly this:
1. Know and understand the fundamentals.
2. If everyone is selling, buy.
3. If everyone is buying, sell.
4. Everyone will tell you you're wrong.
5. People are predictable.
6. The future is not.
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:45:14
Money is just another investment. If you have savings, it's invested in *something*.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:06:07


Err, sorta. It wouldn't have been a big deal but for [the government fucking up]( as per usual.

I rolled all that up into one rule.

You are in for one hell of a wake up call.

Both. Some Austrian economics and the details of the investment.
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:43:14
Take your pick: miss the most unlikely gravy train *ever* or lose it all?
I'll buy some coins when it stops going bonkers. Then I'll sell them when it does again.
