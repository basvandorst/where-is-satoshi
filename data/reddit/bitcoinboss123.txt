Yup, a password should have been provided with the encrypted private key.

Open bitaddress.org, go to wallet details tab, decrypt the key with your password and then try again to import on your wallet.

If it was done through reddit secret Santa try your username?
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:53:13
Yeah, maybe stick it into some sort of photo editing software on an offline pc and clean up what you can and try scanning it again?

It's not worth the effort mate, cpu/gpu mining is long dead.

No, all wallet balances are saved on the blockchain.

Going straight to 10k baby ����

Yes, it's generally accepted that you're too late to start mining bitcoin.

Dec 2014 Here.

Search for 'vanity address' will tell you everything you need to know.

I first bought in Dec 2014, felt comfortable telling my mates to buy in about a year later when bitcoins were ~£200. None of them did, one just bought one a few weeks/months ago for around £2k.

If you're doing it as a hobby, just use the one. If you're looking to make money, I wouldn't bother.

Thanks for the replies, will import the keys into another wallet then send to the trezor.
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:49:04
Don't mine Bitcoin with it.
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:27:25
You stored your password in plain text in notepad and you're wondering if multibit stole your BTC? Think harder.
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:35:36
Why would bitcoins being lost and not available be holding back the price?! It's the other way round mate.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:41:59
You just sent the bitcoins to an address belonging to GDAX, the address that originally sent the first transaction to your trezor. That's if I understand it correctly, haven't actually checked on the block chain.

Your address is : 329ik6YtrRykhz6DuqkMxt2HoKpJM2dczp
Your brother sent the bitcoins to : 329jk6YtrRykhz6DuqkMxt2HoKpJM2dczp
Notice the 329i and 329j, he sent it to another address.

There's a finite supply of 21,000,000

Nope.
