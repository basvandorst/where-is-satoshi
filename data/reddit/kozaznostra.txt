Can confirm, but I thought it only applies to businesses, not individuals.
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:15:27
God dammit Laszlo. Forever bitcoin meme!

Promote BITSTAMP - Segwit since September, ZERO fees on bitcoin withdrawals, longest track record of all European exchanges and worldwide!
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:53:41
Good call. Probably is a good moment to go incognito for a while. You don't want to get the lead pipe.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:03:58
That's cool, but setting it all up on a used android phone is still cheaper :(
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:48:31
Which makes it the best exchange for buy and hold people. You can do dollar price averaging weekly, without running the risk of exchange getting hacked.
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:51:27
In the long run, probably close to nothing as well. Entry barriers are too low. The competition will beat the fees to the ground... Which is a good thing for adoption :)

WHO DESIGNED THIS COIN! IT'S WITH MILLIONS.
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:48:43
Let's hope there is no bug that would allow a third party to post the old state without your knowledge.
@_date: 2018-01-18 07:51:02
Nah, there are tons of people bragging on social media. Obvious easy targets.
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:05:27
Most users are not aware which wallets support segwit anyway. Bitcoin core default wallet does not use segwit yet. 
We are in r/bitcoin bubble, remember, the community reaches far beyond that.

I hope he fucking sold it all for bcash
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:40:11
Kraken is actually regulated. That's probably why they have to put extra scrutiny on large sums deposited.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:08:14
Low fees due to weekend. Exchanges taking advantage of low fees to consolidate incoming user deposits.
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:05:39
Yeah, noone can manipulate the market. Unless someone moves coins from a 500k+ BTC address to an exchange (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:43:29
Sounds like another shitcoin. I'm not buying that.
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:09:56
I can't wait for a legitimate competition to fuck them out of existence.
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:06:58
She will HFT you out of existence, noob. Sell low, mom wants to buy!!

Blockaccino Labs^TM
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:10:13
Yeah, I think its bullshit rumor. They're not suicidal.

The car implies he is fully invested ;)

Make enough Wall Street jocks believe in Monte Carlo and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:02:58
So deep
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:02:33
Or Kim Jong Un is shopping for bitcoin in the nearest country. Also China banned their exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:09:49
That's a very pivotal point
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:19:39
Because it goes up and down all the time, not just before the new years... Duh...
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:05:29
The 2000 USD per bitcoin in 2017, prediction made by Kim Dotcom, sounded insane. We ended up reaching 20k.
Now with predictions at 50k, I'm guessing 500k is not our of reach. Especially with Wall Street money finally flowing in and two ETFs under way.
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:07:15
That's a bunch of FUD. Official statement is to warn, but stay back and watch the development. They plan to include a definition of crypto-currency in the legislation soon, which is good for the recognition. No special tax treatment or anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:40:47
Stop browsing the other sub - nobody is really complaining. You've locked yourself in the big blockers bubble through your social media. Nobody sane thinks Lightning Network is dangerous or unnecessary. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:21:17
Exactly, stop trying to find my wallets
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:11:30
Well, good. Redistribution of wealth from stupid to smart. That's what free market is all about.

Damn Belarus, that's a pretty sweet deal to try out living under the dictatorship.
You think 180 days is enough to get them arrested?
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:20:18
Whoosh! Lightning network is so over the head for the mainstream...
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:54:06
Exchange for crypto, swallow the pain of insane free and withdraw to a legitimate exchange.
Stay away from CEX.io.
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:42:38
Bitcoin goes up, bitcoin goes down. You can't explain that.
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:59:58
Yeah well. With the mainstream media attention, it's becoming increasingly dangerous to blab about owning bitcoin.
Not to mention people are fucking jelly and you might end up with a broken window.
Better stfu about ever owning any, at least for the time being...
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:56:19
Get a used laptop and set up a cold storage with Linux and electrum wallet. Google how to do this.
That used to be my solution before my bitcoin was worth enough to justify buying Trezor.

Joe Rogan already does this in audio version of his podcasts (which is how most people apparently consume his content). He reads an add for Square, stating you don't have to buy entire bitcoin, but you can buy $10 worth of bitcoin. He was advertising Square for a long time and they rolled out bitcoin trading recently, which is awesome.
