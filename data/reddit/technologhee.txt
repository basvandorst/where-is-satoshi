Can you point me towards the bcash dev teams? Developing for bcash doesn’t make sense to me. Who is doing it? Why? I don’t get it

Actually you could follow quite closely the affect it had on the market. It was a driving force of the last two weeks. Follow  and watch the market move. It was pretty eye opening

Thanks for the response. Your “google search” leads me to ads and more questions. I guess the only “development” for bcash is centralized or fraudulent. Thanks for clarifying!

Posting on reddit looking for direction is research. Google provides algorithmic results, humans could lead me directly to the results I’m looking for. Unfortunately, I found a typical bcash response. Attacks and ignorance just like their leader Roger Ver. 
If you know of development teams, direct me to a portal to their communications or progress. In the meantime I’ll keep referring to the fact that bitcoin core code is continuing to be copied to bcash. Thanks.

No it’s not. Listen to the podcast.

Bitcoin is fine. It's an asset unlike any other, numbers unlike any other is to be expected. People will learn the basics over time, no need to adjust to make sense clueless people. Besides, eventually we'll stop comparing to the dollar anyway.

Andreas isn't a Bitcoin shill.....He uses the term bitcoin to simplify cryptocurrency for the uneducated, but he isn't always talking about bitcoin specifically. 
He certainly wouldn't shill bcash, but he is not anti bcash either. 
All that said, I think he absolutely should be the go to speaker for crypto. Dude is awesome.

Terrible advice. He asked about bitcoin.

says the guy who didn't even click the article, much less read it, lol
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:54:09
Guess nobody is going to click the article to see what the actual headline says rather than the headline OP edited......

That’s not similar.

Cool, got any links to your videos of this quality?

It was a marketplace. It was filled by demands that existed, he didn’t advertise or fill the market with products. If it was filled pedo material that would have a been a societal problem. It wasn’t.

People who offer free content that is supported by patreon are not receiving handouts. They are earning income based on their content. It’s literally the opposite of a handout.

This podcast made me realize the importance of a lot of the aspects of this bill.

Luckily the economics of currency valuation aren’t left up to opinion. And yours’ is wrong

He didn’t run a drug operation. He ran a website. Even if he did, that’s not a serious crime.

Neat! All that sure sounds hard though. You described teams of people working for months to make this possible. Easy is certainly not an accurate description of the process. Hope your projects turn out well!
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:59:50
You should go make that happen. Build the bitcoin you want. It's not a product.
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:35:01
Maybe you should form your opinions after you gather the information
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:43:47
Every episode is an hour long but your found everything already. Ok.

Yikes! Populism is not an ideology. You sound nuts

He had roger on a while ago. It’s tough to navigate the stuff

You really have no idea what makes bitcoin special if you believe that
