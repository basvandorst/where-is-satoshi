If i may know. What country are you living in? and how much is the student loan?? back in my place there is no such thing as student load, just scholarships if you are lucky/smart enough. Dunno if it's good thing or bad thing.
Sorry if question is too personal

thanks for the info, quite a manageable number for a loan. private loan is scary as shit and we need to stay away as best as we can in my opinion

Something fishy about BTG and this sub reddit. bot-mod kicked my post inquiring about BTG, but B2X is all over the sub reddit. They say something sort of "dont talk about altcoin here", but this is an upcoming fork of BTC dammit! Why did BTC spiked at 22? Because fork happen at 23! Ez money ez life, insider info FTW /salt

Hi, i want to ask. is this apps only work for US-based credit cards? Thank you

This might be against some popular opinion. I see this as "high roll" way to respond the upcoming fork.
move your BTC to "trusted" exchange who "will/might support" 2x.
* Trusted as in they won't cheat you of your BTC (ppl accuse coin base "might" cheat them their BTC, leaving them only with 2x)
* Support as in listing 2X coins for trade.
My own experience. I did move a huge portion of my btc to a private wallet and that was a mistake in hindsight. Most sane/good/reputable exchange will do a lockdown on trading to help prevent their valued clients burning their own money during the unstable period. 
this made BCH scarce in some exchanges which drive prices up. And ultimately BCH crash then stabilized as soon as trading lockdown lifted. 
so if you think
* you are a good trader
* you are in for a sick ride (in both good and bad way)
* you prepare to take on risk for bucks (big/small is subjective)
then move your btc to your preferred exchange

does counterwallet support the 2nd btc? as far as i know counterwallet did give me the 12 pass phrase
