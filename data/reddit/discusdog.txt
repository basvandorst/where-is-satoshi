What's wrong with Paxful?

# EDIT: 
# TL;DR: LBC sucks, go to Paxful!
@_date: 2018-08-29 12:28:52
Yup. There are other options there too.

This isn't new for bitcoin companies so it's not that of a big deal but I guess anything helps. I hope they fix their support with their growing market

Actually, they have those in the site I'm trading at. It's called paxful.com and they take amazon, itunes and other gift cards. All legal because it's a trade between actual people.

 Sim, Paxful tem sido o melhor em negociar bitcoin

Customer service is terrible! Do not trust lbc with your bitcoin. It has been a month I still haven't got my account back support is unresponsive, they just send you automated messages and don't even read your responses.

Don't generalize us all, man! After their children's day feeding, I started supporting paxful. I really appreciate being part of the crypto-community helping us over here.

They're security measures include an escrow service and 2FA for your account. They also have what you call "verified sellers" who verified their info to the site. If not, everyone is part of the "reputation" system where you're given good feedback for good trades. Just choose the one with the best reputation and I'm sure you'll be in good hands. 
In the unlikely event that things go wrong, just raise a "dispute" and customer support (which are real people) will intervene and get you your money back.

I'm an employee and we are being paid in Bitcoin. It's great because we have more control over our money and the salary seems to be more stable/fixed. No troubles and delays so far too. Often times the virtual wallet is more convenient. 
If ever I need to exchange my Bitcoins to actual money, I found it more convenient to use p2p trading sites. I earn more for what I give and get better deals. In short, I get extra moolah from it. To further illustrate, I use this site called Paxful because it has so many options (around 300\+ I think). So, I usually trade my BTC to cash, debit/credit card, or gift cards for my favorite brands, gaming sites, and subscriptions. There are a lot of buyers so it's such a great score. I basically earn passive income.
