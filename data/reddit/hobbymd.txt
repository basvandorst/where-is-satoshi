it's already divided!!!!  lets not be oblivious about it . You got Chinese miner with more than 51% hashing power and fake volume exchanges to pump &amp; dump . without their consensus the rest of bitcoin community can't do shit. 
Their counter argument in raising block size is their shitty internet connection 
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:03:46
Most of the Chinese mega-farms are cheap !!!! they dont want to pay more for a proper fiber optic  connection because that would hurt their profit margins. all in all they're greedy plus majority of the mega-farm are located in remote locations where proper internet connection would cost a lot for them 
@_date: 2015-06-05 18:55:51
seriously who gives a fcuk about these shady Chinese exchanges where all sorta shenanigan happens on regular basis ( no trading fee, fake volume etc etc !!! ) . What they need is government crack down on them instead.  
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:03:04
it seems you like to do everything at the very last minute just before the sh!t hits the fan :)
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:24:31
so bitcoin is now the same as QQ coin since it's wholly owned by the Chinese miner. So much for decentralization 
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:26:45
lets hope so, for now bitcoin is being run by the Chinese miner and exchanges. This is as centralized as it can get :(
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:21:56
so basically they're holding the rest of the miners around the globe hostage, this is not good for the blockchain .  Almost look like the blockchain is being run by the Chinese.  
I wonder what's the hashing power of KNC , Bitfury and other small miners are combined together. maybe we might have a fighting chance
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:34:08
why is that? if they have the majority of hashpower and fake volume exchanges what's to stop them from blocking every move from ever happening if they don't like it?
@_date: 2014-04-14 20:53:24
damn!!!! you've been around since it was 7 $ and yet you bitching about it? 
lol you must have missed boat load of opportunities to make money, no wonder you sound so bitter 
@_date: 2014-04-14 21:26:09
well there were so many red flags with that exchange that you should have got out well before it went belly up, can't blame someone's incompetence/ignorance on why your coins were stolen. 
just like real life wallet filled with money, can be stolen if you are not careful with it. 
As for identity being stolen, it occurs with big banks/retailers and governments agency so what's your point then? I guess you just like the free booze you get at vegas which is done purposefully to loose your money faster at the casinos while you enjoying the buzz from free booze, only the next day you see the real effect 
@_date: 2014-01-03 16:36:47
then do you know of any better alternative(s)?
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:03:10
after all we are talking about a COMMUNIST country, what else do you expect? land of innovation is a far far cry from that!!!

@_date: 2015-07-13 15:55:59
I know, it's sad to see so many sheeple believing in a flawed system and they don't know any better or willing to educated themselves. And that's exactly what most politicians  will bet on hence sheeple deserve what they get

 "Do you realize that it's the Greek government that spent more than it had for decades and it's now asking the rest of EU for more and more money?  "
Typical average sucker/Joe response here.
          Less than 10% of actual bail out money trickled down to the Greek public , 90% of it went to bail out the private bondholders ( aka big German &amp; French banks) to decrease their exposure to Greek's junk/risky bonds so when Greece eventually defaults they have less exposure.   
@_date: 2015-07-13 14:09:59
lol another gullible response :)   
Goldman Sack  cooked the Greece book for them to join the EU and then big banks went on to loan money ( buying bonds) knowing that it's risky ( kinda like sub-prime mortgage crisis ) but hey at the end the banks got the bailout and collected the interest on those bonds while there were holding them before passing it on to the tax payers  
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:00:56
you don't get it do you?!?!  let me make it a less complicated for you maybe you understand.
 If you have a low credit score but the banks look the other way and give you a loan anyway knowing that at some point you will default, then whose's fault is that? banks or yours?   also who do you think should be on the hook because you defaulted!!! banks that gave the loan knowing the risk from the get go or the taxpayers?
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:16:53
No wrong!!! This whole shitshow started the moment Greece joined EU and passed EU's requirement for joining the union by cocking their finance book with the help from Goldman Sack. From then on Greece was on a path of perpetual debt . It's simple economics, for a country that runs deficit there are 2 options to cover that deficit. Option 1 is sane and most logical response by any sovereign nation and that is devaluing your national currency( it helps by increasing  the imported goods costs and as a result less people can't afford it or buy less of it hence results in net reduced imports from outside hence reduction on trade deficit) .
option 2 is insane &amp; illogical and that's what Greece is doing now. Since Greece can't just go on and print Euros on its own to cover its deficit instead it has to relay on  borrowed money from EU to pay back the old loans it used to cover its deficit. IT's like a ponzi/pyramid scheme.

simply, what an idiot !!!!
In general some politicians seem to don't understand complex matters,  it's above their IQ level. I guess that's why they have staff to simplify the matters for them to understand.

I'm confused, my gut telling me this is the case where something is too good to be true. Not believing it!!!
