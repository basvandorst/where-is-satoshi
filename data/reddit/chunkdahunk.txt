Markets go up and they go down, don't stress on "catching the dip" just buy a little every month and stay in the loop.  You aren't wallstreet so don't try to play that game.  Just hodl and relax!

Idk how coinbase works but when it happened for BCC my coins were on electrum but I had .1 on bittrex. After the fork I checked and there was a new wallet created with .1 BCC in there I didn't have to do anything.
With my electrum wallet I had to do a bunch of steps (fairly easy) to aquire it. I can tell you how it curious but I'm sure a simple Google search will give you the answers. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:13:14
People wanted a dip so here it is, gotta reload the spring to shoot past 8k somehow!
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:06:18
Giant buy walls placed at 7k doubt we will go that low.  Momentum and MACD show upward trends at 11:06 PM.  Might have missed the ol dipper roo

Buy high and sell low
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:14:17
BTC hash rate is the minority chain at this point because BCH is more profitable to mine.  BTC doesn't have enough mining power to get transactions through so that's why fees are so high.  Monday BCH will get a difficulty adjustment making BTC more profitable to mine again.
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:05:02
Mining rig would not be profitable for bitcoin, maybe for other coins, but definitely not bitcoin.  You are better off buying the coin outright.  I"m sure many people will agree with me.  
Best of luck!
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:10:08
Zoom in or zoom out I forget which. Kinda a crappy answer but it works
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:25:15
It's going to keep sliding until the difficulty adjustment takes place. Right now bch is more profitable to mine
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:23:23

There will be a dip but you don't know if the dip will be higher than the price now.
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:07:13
People taking profits? Simple really, and a correction was needed, now we can crush 8k before fork!

@_date: 2017-10-13 03:20:16
Basically you deposit money from your coinbase account to your Gdax account.  Coinbase is considered a middle man for bitcoin if you want to think of it that way.  You pay them "x" for bitcoin plus "y" a fee for them to do the leg work in finding a coin, finding a seller ect.  Gdax links you up to (in theory) people who are trying to trade online.  Leaving it on the exchange is comperable to saying "i'm going to keep all my valuables in a safety deposit box" instead of your own personal safe.  Sure safety deposit boxes are secure but every now and again they get robbed, stolen, misplaced ect.  Having your own personal wallet (personal safe) puts you in sole control and posession of your bitcoin (private key rather).  Hope this helps, dm me for additional questions :)

Make account on Coinbase
Link bank account with Coinbase
Deposit $1000
Transfer money from Coinbase to Gdax market exchange
Enjoy a market place with no fees.
After purchase move into personal software wallet such as electrum.
Save $$ to buy a hardware wallet and for Gods sake don't leave it on the exchange.
Best of luck and welcome to the club! PM for details

Lol keep dreaming.  I'm no expert but breaking through psychological levels is important, and the fact that it surged over 15% today indicates there will be some correction, of how much I'm unsure.  I'm expecting a retracement to upper 4,000 possibly 4750 as a low point.  That was the last real support level before surge.

You could use Gdax which is coinbases market platform. That way you can buy directly from the merchant rather than through a middleman like coinbase. It's super easy to move funds and coins from coinbase to gdax. Worth looking into imo
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:11:46
coinbase: deposit funds into coinbase
Gdax: move fiat from coinbase to Gdax and trade with no fees.

@_date: 2017-07-27 16:39:01
start with $1800
buy 1 @ 1800 then sell at 2800 = + 1000 profit
now you have $2800
spend $2800 to buy 1.166666 @ 2400.  you have now gained .16666 BTC
sell 1.16666 @ 2600 = 3033
You started with $1800 now you have 3033. Profit = 1233
If you bout at 1800 an HODL the price is now 2600 you would have 800 profit.
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:56:40
Here's a question....are there any fee's associated with moving bitcoin's or (private keys) from gdax/gemini/kraken to a trezor?  I know moving to electrum there are some.  Thanks all!

You are fine, don't lose your password/seed. If you own $XX,XXX in bitcoin maybe look into a hardware wallet like trezor or nano more secure.

Usually prices drop on weekends best plan is to read other posts before posting :p
Best way to ensure maximum gain is to dollar cost average simple technique you buy a little bit everyday.  
As for hodl some glorious dude went on a rant and misspelled "hold" hodl and it's stuck.
Someone's bound to link it below
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:11:53
lets crack 3,000 first and stay there before saying $5,000 or higher.  We all want lambos but baby steps people 
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:16:43
Yes I understand you.  For your first question you are gaining 433 but no you don't have additional Bitcoin because you sold all of it.
How about this:
Start with $1800 
Buy 1 BTC @ 1800 then sell at 2800 = profit 1000
Now you have $2800 
Buy 1.166666 @ 2400 
Now you have 1.11666 BTC
Sell 1 Bitcoin at $2600.
You now have $2600 and .16666 BTC
You gained (2600-1800)= 800 profit with a BTC holding off .1666
Now let's say it dips to 2300.  
Buy 1.13 @ 2300 then it rises to 2500.
Sell 1 BTC at 2500.
You made $200 from that trade (2500-2300) and kept .13 btc
So now you have $800 from 1st trade plus $200 from second trade so $1000 profit with $2500 in fiat to buy again.
You saved .1666 BTC from 1st trade and .13 from second trade for total of roughly .3 BTC.
So yes you can save as much or as little BTC as possible and still make $$$ profit

I agree.  When bitcoin prices drop so do the rest of the cryptocurrency market.  Safest thing to do imo is either sell (if noob) or hodl on cold storage.  But its your money use it when you need it!
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:08:56
How much $$ I'll buy
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:57:50

@_date: 2017-06-13 01:34:31
You can use a paper wallet on many sites.  Just have it generate a Bitcoin address then physically write down the seed password phrase and password associated with the wallet.  Say your address is ( or whatever then your seed is like Adam carrot Hansel Fred coat clover dog.....write both down.  Then when you want to access your coins type in the address it'll prompt you for your seed and boom there ya go

whatever the price you bought it at is the price you are charged.  IF the price goes up like you suggest, you just gained $300 worth.

ELI5: Bitcoin is having trouble handling all the transactions.  So many transactions per day (hell per minute) the network can't keep up.  Transactions get delayed and people don't like that.  SO they increase their fees to make sure their transaction goes through.  Higher fees defeat usability of Bitcoin for future use (coffee/bar tabs) so people want to increase network capabilities.  There is multiple ways of doing that but no one has agreed on one....yet.  picture this. Imagine you are at a grocery store and there is one line for checkout.  Each person that checks out is a transaction.  But there is a long line.  Eventually everyone will check out but what if some people got shit to do and want to check out and move along.  So they pay the cashier a fee to jump to the front of the line.  Now here's the issue.  Either you can A open up another cash register (increase block size to 2mb) and now people will have two places to check out.  Seems good right? But eventually two cashier's won't be enough.  OR you could just get rid of the cashier and do an online payment like Amazon go.  Just pay online and skip the line all together.  Both options work as a solution but one is a band aid and doesn't solve the true problem while the other one may take longer and be more difficult to implement but will provide a lasting solution. 
But then again I could be totally wrong. Just my two fiat cents

as long as you have your bitcoins bought before Aug 1st you will be fine.  Just buying them after will be something you want to really investigate.  Depending on which chain prevails (or if any do) then you could be risking buying into the wrong chain and losing your coins.

@_date: 2017-06-12 21:48:21
Electrum for medium storage is free 
Trezoe or nano for high storage $100 
Paper wallet is literally numbers on piece of paper very safe not connected to internet and no technology 
Buy on exchange move to wallet generate seed (random words that act as a password) 
Good luck and welcome to the future
