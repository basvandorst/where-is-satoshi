How do 3 year old documents have info on a recent leak?? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:19:18
Sorry, plausible deniability of what? 
Also, does that mean that the stolen btc was sent from those individual accounts to one main hacker account? 
And if the wallet associated with my account had its btc stolen, while yours didn't, that doesn't mean I'm out btc any more than you right? Because it's all Bitfinex controlled and losses are split equally to everyone? 
Also does Bitfinex have to repay everyone or is it a loss to everyone? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 06:41:28
Let's say he does everything with a microtransaction, no cache, the bitcoin network couldn't handle that right? Wouldn't that mean that he can use megaupload to "kill" bitcoin? Sort of a neverending ddos attack?

I'm just asking if that's possible

@_date: 2016-08-03 03:38:01
What does the government care though? 
@_date: 2016-08-20 13:22:04
Oh wow, i didn't realize Greenwald was on the run so to speak too! I mean if I was the Government, he would be my  target, who cares about Snowden, Snowden's role is over, it's Greenwald who is going to keep releasing documents.
I can't imagine that even if Greenwald is in Brazil, that the US wouldn't send a team to get him??
How can they possibly arrest his partner? Did they let him go yet? That's  a lawsuit no?
Pretty brave of all these people involved to give up their lives dedicated to these docs.
Go Greenwald!
I'm probably on a list now. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:56:18
How does each customer still have a wallet if they deposit to bitfinex, isn't it all combined into one big bitfinex wallet? Or is it in individual wallets except controlled by bitfinex? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:30:07
Just curious how you know it wasn't in an offline wallet? Offline wallets can still be stolen from, no?
Are offline wallets necessarily safe? Or it is, except for inside jobs?
Also, it's just a matter of time until a Poloniex hack isn't it
@_date: 2016-08-20 17:32:42

How does the US government not seize Greenwald's (ie. snowden's) documents? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:59:15
If that is the case, then this is a longggg term thing then right? Because yes each bitcoin is going to be that much rarer, but at the moment it dropped 20% and it's going to take years foe bitcoin to go up 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:02:54
Curious, why can't they cash out? I mean what's stopping them from meeting someone on Local bitcoins and cashing out $1k each time? And he could just send bitcoins to new wallets before doing so, who would know that those wallets belong to the hacker rather than someone else?
I'm not saying cashing out a million at a time, but in small amounts

Do you choose the fees? Could you have chosen an under $5 fee? Or would that have taken weeks to transfer? At $34 and $14, how long did it take to transfer, and does the fee depend on how much you're sending or is it the same whether large or small?

Anyone know the cheapest way to buy bitcoin in toronto?
Is this flexepin cheaper than Atms and other methods? 
Atms charge around 6% fee.
And people are selling on localbitcoins at $578 on a $550 spot price, so this equates to a 5% fee, is that correct?
@_date: 2016-03-19 21:26:15
Right, I just wanted to clarify, that if I just have those 12 words, I can throw away my phone or computer and next year all I need is that to restore my account, no password or .json file or address or anything else right?
Or do those 12 words act as a password for an account, and I still the account address or key or something to go with the 12 words?
@_date: 2016-03-19 20:25:17
When u say seed, what form is that? A file? A 12 word? A key and password? 
@_date: 2016-03-11 23:13:13
Right but what i mean is, this coin is basically a qr code n that's it
@_date: 2016-03-12 01:43:12

New to bitcoin, does having the qr code is all you need to access the value of this coin (which as i understand it is basically a wallet with 0.0001 bitcoins in it)? No password or key or anything is req?

Look obviously there is more to it, and they are not refusing to provide an explanation, in many cases they are not allowed to provide an explanation. The representative you talk to is just a frontline employee who probably does not even have access to such information, and even if they did, many times they are not allowed to disclose such info.
Obviously it sucks to have funds frozen, whether there's suspicious activity or not, but do you really think a multimillion dollar company goes around stealing $10k?

But..... They don't.. Not relative to other options to buy bitcoin. If their fees are so high, what are you using that's cheaper (and why are you asking this question if you have a cheaper option)
Your assumption that "people seem to hate coinbase" is based off of maybe 100 people with complaints about coinbase. While hundreds of thousands of other people have no problem with coinbase
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:21:41
This is FAKE.. Signature is wrong
@_date: 2016-06-16 04:05:46

@_date: 2016-06-05 05:00:14

Why would they steal 10k tho, this is obviously a multimillion dollar company, so unless they have packed up the operation and running away,  they wouldn't steal random 10k?
@_date: 2016-06-08 21:56:09

@_date: 2016-06-23 22:18:59
Doesn't make any sense, I'd rather cash out at $1k and buy a btc back at $500, in the end we both have 1btc but i also had an extra $500 to spend
@_date: 2016-06-03 03:33:08
Right, but even if you did steal a few people's $10k, pretty soon nobody will use your service cause it's a scam and you would lose wayyy more than a bunch of 10k's... It's either a scam and they've run away, or it's not a scam and need to freeze the account for security or whatever legit reason. Nobody runs a business where it's half legit, half scam

This is a huge overreaction by op, nothing more.. And now he posts on Reddit to rally the troops and try to force Bitgold into providing a faster response in this matter than it normally takes. Be patient and it will be resolved, don't go all crazy on forums yelling scam and theft to hopefully get it resolved quicker, he doesn't get preferential treatment / faster resolution just because he goes crazy and calls BitGold a scam/theft

@_date: 2016-12-04 03:48:23
So is it better to pay it off now when it's cheap (might go back up amd you owe $5k again), or do you wait and next month you only owe the equivalent of $500? Or is it basically a gamble?
Also, is the black market super accessible or difficult to access? 
@_date: 2016-06-09 03:21:00

Ok point taken, but isn't maximizing value always a concern? Even if you're just a trustee.. And why did they choose this point to sell instead of 6 months ago or a year ago?
Another thing is, that would mean they aren't actually trying to "crash the market" right? Because as a trustee, he has nothing to gain (or lose) by doing so, if they are neutral and just trying to pay back.
Also, just logistically speaking, how do you entrust 200k bitcoins to a trustee? I mean having the private key to that account (or accounts) means that he can steal it for himself no? Or do they have some sort of system where the private key isn't accessible to an individual (or even a few individuals collectively) 
@_date: 2018-03-13 05:45:31
Is that true tho? Is the value always constant, just exchanging hands? 
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:32:15
Yeah but it's misleading. If you buy at $4k and next year it's worth $1k, then you should have spent your btc to get $4k of groceries now than $1k groceries next year.
This image assumes it keeps going up AND you bought it at a low price. But it can just as easily go down and you bought it at a high price (relatively)

How are you so sure though? Honestly it could go either way

@_date: 2018-03-07 19:12:34
So really he only had to sell off a tiny fraction to cover the losses right? Since it was $450 then and $16 or $19k at the height 
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:00:19
So basically you're saying everyone is a loser
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:59:05
Well really it can go either way, he could be sarcastic or genuine praise. There is no way to tell either way.
If you read the responses they are mostly about the "typo". Whether it is a typo or not, nobody knows 
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:59:41
What does selling the bottom at $6k even mean? Why would they sell when it's already at its lowest point, and it didn't even dip a lot below 6k... Why doesn't he let it recover, then sell for a higher price? Selling at $6k to crash the market doesn't make sense since they're holding much more bitcoin that will be worth even less after crashing the market?

If ID is still required, how did OP (who is 15) buy $300 on circle? 
Ya i don't buy the $0 fee.. The fee must be incorporated into the rate at circle.. So at coinbase the fee for debit is 3.75%? Any minimum fee? 
I guess the question is, if i have $100, which will give me more bitcoin, Circle or Coinbase (after all fees/exchange rate/etc.. is said and done) 
@_date: 2017-07-01 10:11:44
How do you deal with sudden bitcoin price drops? Like if it's $1000 next week. I understand that obviously your bitcoin numbers stay the same, but i mean you have to pay USD to buy the miners, food, gasoline, etc...
