Hello there,
Those transactions you're referring to (70 inputs, 1 output, low fees) are not spam, but utxo consolidating transactions.
There are at least a couple of reasons for doing so:
1. Reducing the utxo set size.
2. Making future payments, where we pay regular fees, smaller since we can take advantage of bigger inputs
I hope this can help
Take care

Hi there,
In order to prove your identity, we requested your SSN before we authorize any withdraw of the funds from that account.
The account has not been closed and you can access the account once the compliance procedure has been completed.
From the previous conversations we have had, please get back to if you need any further explanation.
