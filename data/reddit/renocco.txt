I stopped caring about it as an investment, and just kept the over in $500 btc that I put in. I'm just gonna keep it in until either btc actually starts dying and transfer to some other crypto, or ride it to the moon and start using crypto credit cards when they come out in 5-10years

I suggested that is something he does that is semi frugal. I'm pretty sure that has nothing to do with it though.

I think Joe Rogan just has more money than he knows what to do with. And he definitely likes hunting, but he says he always saves the meat and eats that instead of buying groceries. So that helps him stay somewhat frugal. But he's not some flashy celebrity.

Take your throwaway account and stop talking shit on the internet. You got some money in bitcoins, that doesn't make you some know it all. Trust me. Lmao

Wait I'm going to school to get a CCNA, are you saying when I get a job theres a possibility I'll just get more computer stuffs!?!?!

Joe Rogan is pretty open minded. He also claims to be an idiot. Most close minded people assume that they're right, and everyone who disagrees with them is just completely wrong. That's not Joe Rogan at all.

I'm sorry to have to remind you of the fact you're still on Reddit. You can't expect r/Bitcoin to be the hub for serious discussion. Just be happy that while there are a lot of immature people in this subreddit, we're still spreading Bitcoin and supporting it.

Hey, just becareful not to buy or sell while tripping. Stay safe my fellow psychonaut/bitcoiner
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:46:54
You're being a pretty big asshole on here. You're hating on a guy for being himself. For someone who seems to be into psychedelics I think your sure in need of an ego check of your own. Joe Rogan doesn't claim to be some figure worth trying to aspire to, he's just another guy living life. Joe Rogan has a fighters mentality, and he isn't for everyone. But he's not just a blatant asshole.

Yeah, I love these graphs that have no real meaning. And all these people treating Bitcoin like it didn't exist before it hit 19k.
@_date: 2018-06-30 17:39:14
Haha, the best part is the idea that investors keep their coins on coinbase. Lmao
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:24:53
I'm saying brand recognition in this case is very beneficial to Bitcoin. The average person thinks the term crypto and Bitcoin have the same meaning. Think of the Monopoly Google has on search engines, while Google could fuck up and run itself into the ground. It's still everyone's first choice, and the obvious choice to anyone new to the internet. This is the advantage Bitcoin has.
@_date: 2018-06-30 18:38:04
What you're say makes sense, but I think you're missing a critical pov. You seem to think people will blame Bitcoin for their own losses, instead of blaming themselves for being impulsive or for taking bad advice and investing into something they don't understand. When realistically Nana was niave and didn't do her research, and is now probably not on good terms with Uncle Doug. And yeah, she's probably not going to invest into crypto again. But consider the ratio of people who invested and got burned compared to people who never invested. We're still in very early adoption phase of crypto, and just starting to make people realize it's past the point of being just a proof of concept. The idea is if, and when wide spread mass adoption of crypto happens the real run starts. Compare crypto to beginnings of the internet. It takes time, there's a lot of doubters, there's a lot of foul play, but captialism and creativity over take it and turn it into something more than popular consensus believed was possible. This is the idea behind why crypto is going to be big. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 17:34:19
How is Bitcoin going to die in darkness? You seem to be looking at this way too narrowly. Think of all the milestones Bitcoin has hit since it started the bull run to 19k. It hit 5k, 10k, and 15k all of which were said to be impossible goals. Think about the brand recognition it has now to people outside crypto. It's still the largest crypto, and that doesn't mean it's the best at everything. But it has by far the most robust network, and has dealt with solving more scalability issues than any other crypto. And if you think it's going to fail just because the price became over inflated and is still in correction than you're gonna miss out when it starts going back up again. And if youve come to that conclusion from the idea that there's only room for one successful crypto then you're very mistaken.

I got an idea, maybe hire me as a full-time (or part-time)
advisor" and I'll keep giving the best insights my 21 year old brain can provide. For me the world still seems limitless and full of possibilities. That's the perspective i think I may have that you're struggling to find again. 
I can list some of my accomplishments if you'd like. That is if you're buying into what I'm selling. I've actually lived a pretty interesting life up to this point. 
Edit: I hope you can feel my sarcasm through this text, however I wouldn't turn down an offer. Lmfao.

I'm just 21 and make 9$/hr working part-time in college. Not really qualified to answer your question but I'll do my best. Are you building up a savings account that allows you to lose all fincial income and live comfortably for at least 6 months? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:40:04
Then you seem to be in a position where money isn't an issue, and probably won't be I'd imagine. I'd say you should stop investing your time and energy into trying to just get richer, and try to live a life that let's you experience the world while not blowing through your money. Maybe make a bucket list and start crossing somethings off of it?

This is the best one man party there's ever been! To bad the cops gonna have to come bust this bitch up. We'll be moving this rager over to r/bitcoincash, but I have feeling you mods already visit us.

You set a goal, and you made it to that goal. You're debt free, and that opens the door to so many things. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 06:06:35
This is pretty standard procedure for a fork. Trading slows down, and causes the prices to dip. People sell Bitcoin to buy into bitcoincash so they can get the hard fork coins to sell after the split. Give it a week or two and Bitcoin should be back to the same price it was. Nothing to worry about.

So hostile. But what's your point? If someone wants to go after someone they're going to find a way. Its one of the main rules of security. A good hacker is going to find your weakness and exploit it. OP is using a throwaway account. You gonna trace his IP through Reddit? You gonna cross search google with is username? I doubt it. Use Wireshark all you want...
No one's telling OP to keep flaunting his crypto. But everyone saying he's gonna get mugged from making a Reddit post are extrapolating a bit far. 
And to think OP is gonna open up an email titled "!!!Horny Women in your Area Want You!!!", "You owe X amount to the IRS, reply or you'll be sued and sent to jail", etc. Is a bit far too. Maybe he gets honeydicked, but that's about as far as I'd imagine for someone who is capable of buying crypto ATM. People using crypto aren't ignorant to internet scams, or social engineering. 
And I think you don't know me at all, actually. Lmao
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:05:15
You're fine dude. This guy doesn't understand how hacking a wallet works. Set up 2FA, make a complex password 13+ with letters and numbers and you'll be pretty much untouchable. 
You bought off of an exchange that required your ID, the state already knows you have that Bitcoin. Nothing you can do about that except do a coin join. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:33:41
You're overly paranoid. A lot of people have over 40k in assets and don't get mugged. You're overly conflating the value of BTC as a desirable asset to people that don't have any.
My point is people are going to kill and steal. It could be for 10$ worth of heroine, or it be for an exorbitant amount of money. But no one walking around day to day knows who this guy is and how much BTC he has. The state does regardless of this Reddit post. Also, you do understand that block chain is a public ledger right? Anyone can see the amount in a wallet, so if you trade with anyone they can instantly know how much you have. You're scope of understanding the whole picture needs to be broadened. 
No one is saying don't look out for people. But this is unnecessary, and could just make OP extremely paranoid or other people to the point that they don't adopt crypto.

Can confirm. Security people are overly paranoid about potential exploits. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 03:12:11
Yes, and no. Theres a few different types of crypto users, and that's important to understand when looking at all of this. But too keep it simple I'll dumb it down to two groups. Those who are in crypto, and those who have bought crypto and never done anything past having coins in a wallet. The latter group mainly being buyers who bought into crypto because of hype without understanding tech in general, much less crypto. This is the people who get scammed, and fall for ponzis. 
The only real way to hack someone's wallet is to spoof a SIM card and break 2FA that way. Otherwise you're looking at physical property in most cases. Which if OP has 40k I hope he has a hardware wallet, and some paper ones for back up. But my point is I highly doubt he's gonna be targeted because of this post alone. Especially when there's plenty of crypto players and whales.
