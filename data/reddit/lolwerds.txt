so much blockchain

IMO , service providers , like they are classified in those nifty infographics ( all the way down to miners ) + BTC holding voters need a mechanism for this.
not sure why we need anything more then eloquent speakers, and maybe some people with actual Lobbying connections / contracts to voice what is "consensus" desire. 
seems like this is the progression BTC needs , to really be , what it wants to be. an open base / currency / commodity / unit / system ... that can also have its "direct representation" from Users, which is something the current systems of governance have moved leaps and bounds away from.
people should have short / near term jobs to do, and voted budgets to do it. anything less is simply like most "associations", lot of PR and Back Pats.
good luck to those trying to sort this need out, we def need it.

odd that so many people were giving her props in the video itself. the entire panel was bad. poor structure, obviously little prep work or agenda. Little Rascals, right, b/c some MC is our Darla.

this is great stuff. I used to live on TigerDirect in the 90s, building my sweet 2x Voodoo Rigs etc.
+1 for getting BTC in there.

the same , 100's of Ks worth , no issue in or out.

how much do you think you will spend daily? 
to make the ad? 
to run 10s , 15s , 30s spots ? 
what networks do you think it should be on
do you think it should be as present as say Bid Site ads? 
@_date: 2014-07-25 17:47:43
how many of your 30000 users are active daily? 
@_date: 2014-06-15 20:16:19
interesting , as a large miner , it's interesting how much control very limited scope thinkers are exerting. unfortunately those who attempt to mimic the PE world of M&amp;A type growth in BTC will be the direct cause of its loss of value.

was one of them settling in another CUR , p2p on site arbitrage YARGH!
@_date: 2014-03-24 14:01:10
why's that ? day on day , my 100+ THs works fine.
@_date: 2014-06-07 16:05:45
everything that couldn't be done before, can be done now. big centralized institutions are over exposed to fraud and risk, and cannot compete with P2P transactions in that regard :)
now go share your tentacle porn :) 
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:14:33
everyone wants to make something from something less.
@_date: 2016-03-20 17:43:49
what was the fee , whats the TX ID , let's have a real discussion ? what wallet did you send from ? how many confirms did your balance have prior to sending ? 
@_date: 2014-06-27 02:33:00
add more layers to your CC process. as a specialist, I can point you in the right direction.
reminds me of the old Paypal days, people gotta act for themselves. 
and BTC != REMOVAL OF CC, one is credit, the other is cash. if you are American, 90% chance you want to extend yourself. :) 
@_date: 2016-03-20 18:22:36
a whole 6 penny fee .. omg .. 
@_date: 2016-03-20 18:27:13
so some online exchange / wallet. I'm sorry I'm not familiar with it as I'm not in MX. I do send BTC all the time, don't see these kind of problems after 1000s of transactions.
what does their support say ? 
@_date: 2016-11-28 15:12:59
nah , throwback to SF not always being a tech area , the old families, the true nor cal :) 
@_date: 2016-12-13 15:03:47
some hypervocal chinese pool with a US node ... wow , how original. 
don't you have some drama to stir up? or progress to slow down?

first .. congrats. brand rep stops them stealing it today. exit scams can hit any size operator, especially those operating in countries that make piercing the corporate veil nigh impossible.
not saying that is what Blockchain.info is doing , or setup to do , I love them TBH , but you asked , so here is a truthful answer.
bitcoin will go through many of the same issues that cash did , online wallets are like the banks of old , so it's logical, we'll see heists. opsec , devsec , 0day sec at most of these companies is laughable at best.
trust only what you can control. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 14:01:46
your WTF is misplaced. BTC's largest problem , lack of user base / user case. Stripe, large user base. Get the users, get the value.
@_date: 2016-12-13 23:38:08
what services support that ? been away from years but wanted to do 8 months back and hate the utility bill game :) 
@_date: 2016-12-07 19:36:05
or , wikipedia gets current ?

welcome back

while I don't agree with the direct math used to derive fees, there is something to be said about , finite resource, with lessening reward , yielding "X" unlimited growth in fees as it picks up usage.
key really to any of the currencies is to increase the user base, and use case exponentially, for anyone expecting these kind of totals.
@_date: 2016-10-20 17:56:34
we need so many more outreach programs like this
@_date: 2016-05-13 14:54:48
depends on if it's Sativa? anyway , ETH benefits from BTC as a currency to fund it , or gateway to other funding currencies. BTC benefits from increased usage and halo exposure. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 22:59:03
why ? will it bring merchant continuity ? 
@_date: 2016-05-13 13:31:01
why ETH ? if you're a BTC fan , they are complimentary.
