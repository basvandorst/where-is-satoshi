It's not uncommon for Hungarian to be compared to Japanese.  Magyar is in a family of languages with Finnish that belie the people's migration from Asia.  Ancient Hungarians were Asian in appearance.

You're certainly correct that the market is a reflection of public sentiment and mindset.  What should become visible soon is the growth in 2017 never stopped.  It just hasn't effected the price.  Once the large sells stop we'll see the same growth pattern as last year.  I doubt everyone will just give up and move on.  There's too much excitement and this tech has broken out of only being understood by small circles of computer enthusiasts.

@_date: 2018-03-08 20:28:55
I said he didn't only sell low.  He sold many times and the last time was the lowest.  It wasn't the bottom, but that's not very relevant because his sell probably created the bottom.  He sold the day before the bottom.  That said, if 80% of his sales were for a much larger dollar amount, how can you conclude that his intentions were to crash the entire market?  The source does link to the transaction, but that link doesn't say what the sell price was.  You are stating he sold at 6K, while it was closer to 10K.  
I don't mind being called wrong, that's fine.  Your assumption that I don't do any research is incorrect.
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:59:14

The tx there says feb 5th, the day before the bottom.  The time says 6:23, at which the price was nearly 8K &amp; the bottom was 6K.  So while this is almost a semantic argument, he didn't sell at the bottom.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:19:33

These things you say are untrue.  I have posted countless counter arguments.  You state that I am attacking you personally, while I have tried to remain pragmatic.  You, however, inject vitriol into all your statements (for example, "with their pocket money they got from their mommies".  Here, I'll put some of my counter arguments in one place for you:
This makes no sense. You can't keep buying and selling while something goes up in price. You can only sell once. Once you've done that you'll be buying at a higher price than you sold and therefore not profiting.
The bitcoin doesn't know if you are selling at a profit or a loss. A sell has an effect, a buy has an effect, the conditions of each has no bearing.
Nope. Each sell and buy negated each other as far as the effect on the market goes. What I said is you can't sell and buy as the price of something goes up and make more money. You've lost money in comparison to someone who didn't sell.
Now, you say you've avoided price drops. That's not a strategy. You buy when it drops and sell when it's high, not sell and buy while it's going up.
While I've been polite to you, you've decided to identify yourself as an economics professor (even though you use k instead of K for one thousand) and have instructed me to go read a book and argue with you later. Simply because of your horrible attitude I am not interested in continuing this pointless discussion.
Let's say everyone sold at once and nobody wanted to buy. The price would go to 0 without a single trade. Let's say everyone wanted to buy but all the exchanges were down and nobody could buy a bitcoin. The price would go up without a single trade. It's like new generation console releases at Christmas time. The limited supply drives the price up. The fundamental principal of economics is the supply, demand, and price relationship. You say you're an economics professor but seem to not understand supply and demand. You're premise of selling makes the price go up is misinformed. A bunch of people buying when there are fewer selling is what makes the price go up. It's a pressure system where the flow is dictated by supply and demand.
You see here how the value of your time goes up due to the limited supply? That's kinda like how markets work.

I did not run out of arguments.  You do not understand supply and demand.  You don't make much sense and have a bad attitude.  I looked at your post history and noticed that you have a history of thinking you are very smart and insulting people who you either disagree with or people who you think you are smarter than.  Looking at your post history put things into context for me.  You've told at least three people that they have no understanding of how markets work &amp; all three of those people simply explained the basic principals of supply and demand.  It's frustrating at first to have someone say "I'm a really smart person, go read a book, you have no clue about anything" but to then look at their post history and see every comment is down-voted is a bit of a relief.

1. in that same post you used bullet points and complicated formatting, so blaming your phone doesn't seem appropriate
2. You said go read a book, I'm trying to teach economics.  I understand now that I misinterpreted your vitriol for honesty.  I'll concede this point to you.
3. You're losing 1K in between 8 and 9K.  I provided the math to you before in anther thread.  It was something like 60% return vs a 30% return using your previous example.
4.  I don't know what you're replying to here.  The basis of all our arguments against you have to do with supply having an effect on cost, which you completely deny.
5.  Here you go again calling people dumb and you smart.  It would be better if you simply provided knowledge and let the facts stand on their own.  Making claims isn't persuasive without basis. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:22:44
Think about what you've proposed here.  In your scenario you have the 8K sold at 9K with 1K profit, you add 1K, buy at 10K and then another 1K profit, add 1K, buy at 12K and then another 1K profit at 13K.  So essentially you've added 2K to your investment and made 3K profit, so 10K invested = 3K profit at 13K total.  If you didn't buy and sell your 8K would have made 5K profit at 13K.  That's a 62.5% return vs a 30% return.  So you're saying that the big whales in the market prefer a 30% return over a 62.5% return on investment? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:06:38

Bitcoin is finite, so the energy expense is finite and tied to tech innovations.  The net energy used will be only negligibly different due to trends.

3. You simply do not sell and buy over and over again during a bull run, it's just silly to do that.  You're not buying low.  In your example you are buying at one thousand above your previous sell price.  Your formula will leave you holding the bag when it hits an ATH.
5. Hoarding supply changes a market.  That's the whole reason there are farming subsidies.  They are creating corn hodlers (lol) rather than flood the market with corn supply.   Lets say there are five bitcoin (a,b,c,d,e) and six people in the market.  Here are two scenarios, pick the one that will cause the price to go up the most:   SCENARIO 1: a has a sell call at $1, b at $2, c at $3, d at $4, e at $5; SCENARIO 2: a is hodl, b is hodl, c is hodl, d is hodl, e at $5.

I've got a tin foil hat theory that is making more and more sense the more I think about it.  The big run for BTC started when Donald Trump took office.  He's under investigation for collusion with Russia.  Vladimir Putin is possibly the richest man in the world with billions in hidden funds.  If Putin is paying off Trump, couldn't he be doing it in bitcoin?  We saw a crash just a little while after Putin announced candidacy for president.  Couldn't they be selling their coins after the major transactions have concluded?
