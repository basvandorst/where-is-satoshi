I still don't understand bit coins or how to use them and I want to sell my one bit coin for actual money. How do I do this? It is an actual coin, says 2011, vires in numbers on one side, the reverse has a code and hologram with casascius on the bottom, please help. I am a bit coin dummy and not really interested in these, I just want (need) actual money at the moment.

Ok please stop arguing. I'll admit I'm stupid when it comes to this stuff, but I was told by the person who gave me this not to just give out the code, and not to peel the holographic sticker off. I checked that website and it shows me the balance is 1. What do I do now? I'm sorry to have bothered you people with this.

It's not the same as your example really... But... Using that example, if that person went to a seemingly tech-savvy person asking what a website was, and got a response containing lots of unexplained computer jargon, then both parties have accomplished nothing - The educator has taught nothing and the would-be student has learned nothing. All the answers I get are in terms someone ALREADY FAMILIAR with bitcoin would understand. I admit, I'm clearly a bit coin novice (or idiot, at this point), but I was looking for information... In clear, concise, easy-to-understand terms.
And I don't even know what that circle spin thing is, but yes, I would love to sell, but all I have read said Ebay and Paypal are full of scam artists. Is there some trustworthy website that readily exchanges bit coins for REAL USD? I would think there has to be, since people are buying bit coins for dollars. The reverse must be true... Right?

Ok I'll try. Thanks for your help.
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:55:31
Ok cool, mine says December. Is it ok to show the number on the back, since it's just the first part of the code like they did, or would you say no?
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:15:06
Wow, they would probably think that of me... I haven't used Ebay in several years because I got ripped off once, and so I closed my account... :( This is rather scary. I'm definitely not going to meet anyone though! Ebay is saying I have to accept an electronic payment method, but I'd rather just get a money order like you said...  I'm so worried this isn't going to work because I have no idea what I'm doing. Thanks for all your help though!

Thank you. I'm an idiot when it comes to this stuff, but the balance has now been verified as one bit coin. It has 2011 on it. How do I best avoid getting scammed? Do I just mail the person the actual coin? I don't even use Ebay... :/ I'm not trying to be difficult. I am at your mercy for help because I don't use these things.
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:38:05
I'm in the us, sorry. Thanks for the advice. I have very limited knowledge of these and how they work, so any help is appreciated.
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:50:55
Lol I don't use Ebay, but I am going to try in the morning... What stuffs should I look for when it comes to scams? Wish me luck!

If this is the case and Bitcoin users want other people to start spending, why is it so hard to use? Sorry, but I am not bitcoin savvy and any time I ask about them, I am met with frustratingly terse answers (if any at all). Nobody has yet made it clear to me how to even participate, which is why I'm trying to sell the one stupid bit coin I have, for real money that I can actually use. I no longer want to participate.... This is like being told at a casino that I can't cash out after I'm finished playing.
It's not an inclusive community. I don't want to purchase drugs or guns or paraphernalia or porn. So why do I need this?
(here come the  downvotes lol because I know they're coming... Anytime I ask a question)

Oh yeah, do I have to have a ”wallet” (whatever that is)? I am so so sorry, I have very limited knowledge about this (lol which is why I want to get rid if it). The person who gave me this mentioned it, but again, I have no clue what the hell it means.
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:42:36
Lol mine has a spelling error on the back, so I guess that's a good thing? How much is it really worth? (USD)

On your answer to number six, why would someone desire bitcoins if they have no desire to purchase illegal items?
I have a bitcoin and no clue really how or where to spend it. I'm stuck with this forever because it's difficult to use.

I don't have anyone; that's why I am asking here. Sorry to have bothered you.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:26:18
Thank you! I'm still not sure what to do with this, so I'm asking around. Ebay requires you to use some method of electronic payment, and I don't want to get scammed...

Thanks. All of this bit coin stuff is new to me. I was referencing the above comment that said, ”It's also backed by drugs, the black market, and gambling.” If I decide to get into this, what's the best way to earn them? I heard about mining and kind of know what it is, but I can't use my computer for that. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:48:17
I am just discovering that it is a first printing? (company's name misspelled on the back). What is that worth?
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:28:29
And yes, that it the kind of coin I have.
