ah, I think I get it. But this will only apply if fiat is still around and bitcoin operates as this "alternative" currency. Otherwise it would be impossible to spend increasingly smaller portions of my holdings. Correct? 
This will never be the case if there is no forex of bitcoin/(insert any currency)

I made this assumption because of some of your, rather strong worded, comments. :)
How do you see the future of bitcoin?

How would you deal with banks that don't allow any fiat coming from selling bitcoin?
*Please don't respond with "never sell, it's stupid"*

Thanks again, I'm seeing your point the same way, I believe.
Out of curiosity, how would you see bitcoin used as a currency in the future?

Nice, was echt een fijne aflevering!

I have yet to find one in my country. :(
All so far have declined and I checked with 5 of them.
A 6th is asking HQ.

Since I got into crypto I feel like a neanderthal and visionair at the same time.

Kraken is fine. They have a German account for europe
@_date: 2019-08-23 07:19:33
What makes you say that?
@_date: 2019-08-23 11:02:44
@_date: 2019-08-21 14:52:42
yeah, true. This last bit was overthinking. 
Thanks dude. You've cleared some stuff up for me.

That's beside my point. It's great that companies are adopting bitcoin as a mean of payment.
The question is more. Why should I book my flight on Expedia and pay with bitcoin today, which should increase in value over time for it being deflationary and having a fixed supply, when I can pay with fiat today which is losing value over time.
@_date: 2019-08-21 13:52:42
Thanks for the reply.
This I understand. It would be awesome to be able to buy real estate with bitcoin in my country. But I see this as a transfer of something valuable to another valuable thing. (that normally also increase in value). So from this point of view or as a store of value I can follow. But what about mundane stuff as buying groceries or eating out, going on holiday, etc. 
Or am I overthinking this?
EDIT: what I mean is. Why go out for diner today and spent X amount of bitcoin, when this amount would be worth more tomorrow? When I spend dollars or euros today, it's quite obvious that I better spend them today. Because tomorrow they will be worth less.

I have seen this statement many times but I have a hard time grasping it or seeing it in the correct light.
When people say that bitcoin is deflationary and that it promotes saving. Then what is the purpose of spending it?
If bitcoin has the potential of being hard currency, having a limited/fixed supply and should increase in value over time. Why would you ever spend it? 
I am all for a total adoption and seeing bitcoin used as a currency, that would be awesome. 
But this is where I have a hard time grasping the concept. If I don't have an incentive to spend bitcoin, because it's value will increase in the future. Then how can it become a currency and spending mechanism? Quid when all bitcoins are mined? 
I'm new to crypto and I'm educating myself. I'm starting to see the potential and future, but this is a genuine question I have.
@_date: 2019-08-21 14:09:48
Ok, I'll bite. I see your comments get downvoted all the time and I see you have given up on bitcoin and crypto in general. 
Why has bitcoin failed if, as you said yourself, it can still be used as a store of value? 
Why the negativism?
@_date: 2019-08-23 12:11:04
Once you exceed certain amount of € or certain amount of transfers, they do ask. It triggers anti laundering bells and you get questions.
If you mention bitcoin or ignore it, you're fucked.
@_date: 2019-08-21 14:46:38
I appreciate your detailed replies!
Lastly, if I may: 
When our current system makes the price of any given purchase increase over time it stimulates "spending", right? 
So even if we change our mindset, there's no fiat around and you'll need an increasingly smaller amount of sats to purchase the exact same item over time. How does this solve my initial question? 
Wouldn't people rather hold their coins because this 5 sat coffee will only cost 4 tomorrow?
