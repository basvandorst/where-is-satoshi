Are you sure you have not succumbed to the Disney definition of a friend?  
I don't have to hang out with people who are exactly like me. I have no need to make them into copies of myself. That's not how you learn, it's how you end up with echo chambers of  whackjobs that won't listen to anyone who isn't already just like them.  
A doctor would never be able to have a conversation with anyone who isn't a doctor because no one is prepared to debate them. So everyone has to just agree, until another doctor shows up. People from one political party could never associate with the other party without changing their entire belief system. In such a scenario you will never be educated enough to be friends with anyone who isn't already so close to what you are that you have nothing to gain by associating with them.

Not to start shaking my dick at you or anything but that sounds like a high maintenance friend. The people I know are all far too varied and specific for me to be taking every one of their opinions to heart at the same time. Oh you mixed up house with dub-step? Idiot. You used carrots for the roast? You fucking ruined it. You've only watched Watchmen? Philistine.  
You're not wrong, far from it. It's just if you threw out a friend every time they didn't listen you would have no friends.

There's a difference between knowing the advantage of fact based evidence and expecting every association you have to put in personal time to devote themselves to *your* facts. One is helpful, the other is insufferable, and unless you have a very small mono culture group of friends it's unrealistic. 
How much do you know about nutrition? Native American relations? The TPP? The 2016 election? Proper tattoo aftercare? The make and model of your vehicle? Your genealogical history? Everyone's got things they think are important.  
Edit: I will add in this case it's someone who started asking about it, got halfway in and then acted the fool, so in this case it's different.

No, I'm saying when you have multiple people in your life from varying backgrounds and you're not in an echo chamber you constantly run into situations were people are presenting you with contradicting facts at the same time, and the friend that's making you fact check shit only he cares about to maintain your friendship is an easy friend to lose. If you actually cared about 'truth' you wouldn't need to unfriend someone because that does nothing to cure anything.

Even the people who are hodling use it as money. If you invest your currency, does it stop being currency?
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:23:57
Technically you're purchasing assets with currency. The currency is still in circulation.

Sure, if no one is using it. Literally no one. What are you going to do when speculators start selling their bitcoins at a loss? 
If everyone stops buying cars, highways stop getting paved and the entire transportation network dies. That's only going to happen if cars suddenly stop working or something better comes along. Cars almost didn't actually take off either. People hated them because they scared the horses. If the automobile didn't receive a rush of popularity and get adopted by people we'd still be on horseback. What those people thought meant nothing to the practical application; what mattered was getting people behind the steering wheel so cars outnumber horses.

Well congrats. You made me cringe so hard I now need corrective lenses.

Just so you know: when you get a little older people you know will start to have kids, which will make them have to spend time with those kids. It's just one of those things that comes with growing up. Well, not you. I doubt anyone's going to be leaving you alone with one, so you won't really have to worry about that.

That's not even close to healthy skepticism. Your country has either just had massive election fraud from Russian hacking exposing fake news, or its media is pushing a false narrative of election fraud aimed at Russia which is also fake news. And you're sitting here going 'Well I heard on the news..."  
Go out and talk to a random stranger about bit-coin and see what they've heard. Not the smartest looking guy at the coffee shop, your average news watching voter. This isn't a conspiracy, it's group acceptance of false narratives. That's not alt-right it's moderate.
@_date: 2016-12-11 01:38:25
You're associating Neo-Nazi beliefs with the phrase 'fake news'. You guys are getting straight up Orwellian and it's getting really discomforting. I'm not worried about Iran, I'm worried about you guys. Get off the fake news before you think nuking Russia is a good idea.

Baggy pants are common at stop and frisk searches. Are you saying that pointing out that popular mainstream American news is objectively misleading the majority of it's viewers with selective coverage is enough to accuse someone of being alt-right?  
Because I'm a Canadian who voted for the NDP last year with a mixed race brother who's supporting the Dakota protests telling you right now that right there is the fake news people are getting shoveled right now. You're completely full of misinformation. Fuck Trump just so you know this is believable. You just elected a guy that should have been investigated for child diddling 10 years ago. It's bullshit the whole way down.

What? No you didn't.  


You didn't answer this elephant in the room you're tiptoeing around, let alone with a quote. I don't have to say much; the ESAP was instituted with the help of the World Bank and was a major factor in Zimbabwe's economic problems but you didn't mention it.
Quite frankly, I don't care much about what your average person finds racist. You've summed up an entire economy collapsing as taking things from white people and giving them to black people while accusing OP of oversimplifying in what's basically an art project.
Ok you've got your next comment to convince me you weren't doing what you were accusing OP of doing. It's really nice outside and I'm not doing quote wars today.
@_date: 2016-07-30 14:54:16


Yes, so it would be foolish to only mention agricultural confiscation when there were many other factors at play. It would also be foolish to state it in a way to leave people with the impression that it was the taking of land that did it when it was replacing people who knew how to farm with people that didn't, which dropped agricultural production.   


No it had to do with the ESAP and the World Bank.


Good thing no one's done that. Or did you read 'Americas problems are the same as Zimbabwe's' somewhere that I missed?  
I mean, I don't know if it was your intention but your response makes Zimbabwe's fall look like the consequence of touching white peoples stuff without permission, which isn't just kinda racist it's also really inaccurate.

In all fairness you asked nicely for sources in the middle of a shitshow of a thread. Everyone right above and below your comment is name calling and throwing monkey faeces. It's like asking the neighbours for a cup of sugar when they're getting all domestic on each other.
