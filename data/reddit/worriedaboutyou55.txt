If i could pay 100 bucks everytime it drops i would i gotta be carefull like 5%  of my money is me spending 250 total im already at 100 dollars in so another 150 then i have to wait to earn more before i go above 5%
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:38:18

I just invested 50 bucks in bitcoin time to hodl
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:01:30
Safe guess is around 100,000

See how far it dips then hold and buy what you think you can afford

I dont consider it catching its just gambling that it will eventually spike again so if it drops futher than ten thousand might as well put the other couple percent of my income its safe to invest ive only invested 100 apparently 5% of the money i own is 250 so ill but another 150 into crypto if it goes down hard
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:45:10
Hope it goes up if it doesn't well ill just put another 100 bucks into the next low but its going to have to go low enough and stay around that for 2 weeks for me to justify another purchase

Trumps getting rid of restrictions for wall street last time the market crashed it was the highest it was ever at the time stock market does not indicate health of overall economy. Most of these new jobs are low wage ones

Im at a about to buy status waiting for the next rise should have sold what little i put around in around the 8k mark months ago but i was busy with life and im a holder and it was only about 100 bucks so ill just keep it there for a hopeful december moon. Also doesnt help i have to do some bullshit  with the banks(live in canada) to even consider doing that so i put it off because i knew it would be pain in the ass
