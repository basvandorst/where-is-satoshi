Wouldn't it be better to just buy bitcoin with whatever part of your pay that you have available?
That said, as an employer, don't tell someone you'll pay them 1 bitcoin every week for example. A contract would mean you might pay your employee 600 USD one week and a few weeks later 3000 USD worth.

I highly doubt someone seriously tips hundreds of dollars to accounts other than his own. Even for april fools that's extreme.

I might have.

Barely anyone knows who's running for these elections. Voting is pointless since people are less involved in the city council elections. A week prior to the elections you see boards of smiling faces everywhere with names you've never heard of. Not going to vote.

Sir, here ☐ and here ☐. Please stay within the borders this time.

There is no so the jurisdiction of financial matters is in my hands until that role is filled. You're free to apply for the function as Bitcoin-CFO.
EDIT: Actually there is one. He's been notified of this matter. 
Thank you.

This might have been done on purpose?

No, I'm just fulfilling the duties of a COO.
@_date: 2014-03-12 21:30:15
Yes, that's much appreciated.

Sir, I'll put a sell order of all our crayons. Since the last time you signed a document using crayons our competence has been scrutinized.

To my knowledge has not made such a remark. I do estimate that we can handle at least 3 moons worth. Our forecast has 6 moons in sight by the end of the quarter and we're confident that we'll deliver more than we promise.

This report is false. China has harmed the Bitcoin economy to a certain degree, but Bitcoin is strong enough to overcome China's departure. This departure was not due to a ban on our part but by the Chinese government. These bans still leave the door to Bitcoin open in case things pick up. Nobody wants to miss the Bitcoin train before it departs.

If I were to create something like Bitcoin, I'd claim to be a highly educated japanese person with the most generic name even if I work in a team and am not even Japanese.
