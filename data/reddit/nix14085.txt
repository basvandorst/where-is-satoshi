If your girlfriend is going to leave you because she's better than you at something then that's not a girl you want to hold on to anyway. 
Only doing things with her you're better at then she is and not letting her do things she likes because you aren't good at them is a good way to annoy her to the point she'll just stop talking to you.

Easy solution, don't say kilobits.  Do you say kilodollars or kiloeuro?

but I'm wiling to bet there is gold in a lot of the electronics you use everyday
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:39:55
How would you do this anyway? Who would hold the gold? and since when are stocks tangible? 
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:49:35
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.  Perhaps hold what you have and start putting savings into another asset to diversify.    
@_date: 2014-05-15 22:54:09
okay, that *is* pretty awesome

This is great!
Paypal could easily incorporate bitcoin into their existing structure, and provide all of the same services they already offer.  A lot of people on here talk about how great it is that bitcoin is trustless and doesn't have chargebacks, etc. but not everyone wants that.  A lot of average consumers are happy to pay a few fees if someone is taking the responsibilities to protect their money. This way they have someone to blame, and if necessary, take legal action against if something goes wrong.  Not saying this is the best option, but the best thing about bitcoin versus traditional payment system is it will give you options. Those who want control of their own money can have it, and those who want someone to do it for them, will have companies like Paypal.  Hopefully this will get a lot more people involved in bitcoin if they (at least think) they can trust the company that they are dealing with
Please don't read this thinking I am saying Paypal is a good payment processor, i'm not.  However they wouldn't be so successful if a lot of people didn't trust them.  The average consumer will be much more willing to trust a company that has been around for a while and is incorporating the currency, than one who is just starting and could just as easily disappear with everything

If we went with bits, we wouldn't need to worry about any of this. No one says kilodollars or gigaeuro, you just say a thousand dollars or a billion euro.  If you wanted to go to centibits, just call them cents.  You know, like normal money.  
@_date: 2014-05-23 20:34:06
But for a taxi fare (at current price) you could use the Bitcoin denomination and say .04 Bitcoin.  Bits makes it future proof and easier for micro transactions so you don't have to count a bunch of decimals.  Plus we normally make it easier to read large numbers by adding commas (1,000,000) but not to small ones (.000001) 
@_date: 2014-05-08 04:17:57
Great idea! the more people we can give BTC to the more we will spark interest for it
Edit: thanks for the tip!

This seem like the common format for reddit posts, a lot of good intelligent arguments, followed by an insult at the end that everyone focuses on and negates the whole argument.

But how many millions (billions?) of electronic devices also use "very little"? It adds up.  
Yes it could be replaced by other metals, with lower conductivity, or that corrode, or that are more scarce and thus more expensive. And all these metals have physical value as well

It seems like most of us agree on the concept, we just disagree on the term.  I think the main problem now is there are too many denominations to keep straight.  Most money in the world works on 2 denominations ("dollars" and "cents") so to introduce a currency with 5 or 6 is unnecessarily confusing.  If you want bitcoin to succeed it needs wider adoption by the general public and taking the mindset of "well I know how it works, just figure it out" is not a good way to recruit new users 
@_date: 2014-05-16 22:40:28
How do you *know* its still falling? How do you know it won't bounce up tomorrow on some headline?  That's why you buy in incrementally on the way down.  Even seasoned traders rarely, if ever, are able to buy in their entire position at the absolute bottom.

The difference is gold has an intrinsic physical value outside of the price (think jewelry, electrical conductivity, etc.).  Whereas the technology behind bitcoin has value, but it doesn't necessarily need bitcoin itself to have that value.  It is better than USD because there is a limited supply (like natural resources) but it still doesn't have the valuable physical attributes that precious metals have.  The only value bitcoin has is the value we give it.

He can't help it, he's learned the world works in a specific way an Bitcoin doesn't fit into his mold. The reason he is an academic rather than an industry leader is that he can't think outside the box.

someone should make a bitcoin version of taskrabbit.com
@_date: 2014-05-02 00:16:40
Yes, I agree.  I don't think Bitcoin needs to be backed by anything, it has value on its own.  What I am saying is that you can't compare bitcoin (or any digital property for that matter) to physical commodities because they have a physical value that will support it.  It is highly unlikely that a precious metal will fall to 0 short of worldwide catastrophe, however it is possible (though unlikely any time soon) for bitcoin to fall to 0.  Someone could come out with a newer better technology, for example, making it obsolete. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 21:48:12
Yes, it's true that the only value on things is what we place on them.  what I'm saying is Gold has additional value outside of currency for its physical traits, whereas bitcoin only has value as a currency.  The blockchain technology has limitless uses and thus would have a lot of value, but it isn't dependent on bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:38:49
The best thing about bitcoin is you have options you didn't have before.  If you want to keep total control over your keys, you can, and if you want to give up some of that control in exchange for convenience and insurance, you can do that also.  Just because its not the way you choose to manage your funds doesn't mean it isn't right for someone else.  
@_date: 2014-05-16 21:49:23
Clearly you should wait until its at least doubled in value before you even think about buying. Who would want to buy into an asset at low prices?
