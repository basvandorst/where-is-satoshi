Looking at some of these posts, I'd say the majority of the sub reddit are children without jobs.

I personally like Peter and watch his videos pretty often.  His view on Bitcoin is the only one I disagree with.  He has been discrediting Bitcoin for years and continues to be proven wrong.  At some point you have to admit to defeat and get with the program.

It's simply not possible to state one method will perform better than the other on average for the future.  All you can say is one performed better than the other in the past during a specific time frame.  Lump sum truly only performs better if you hit the timing just right which rarely happens.  
If you lump summed at the beginning of 2017, you performed much better for the year over DCA.  If you lump summed the beginning of 2018, you got killed compared to DCA all of 2018.  If you lump summed this year, you're beating DCA as of right now.  Hind sight is always 20/20 and it is easier to say what you should of done after it has happened.
Early this year was a great time to lump sum but how many did?  The majority were calling for sub $3k Bitcoin remember?  No one thought Bitcoin was going to rise as fast as it did.

Rarely goes up 10% in one day either.

Neither lump sum or dollar cost average investing have an actual profit advantage over the other.  Either one can play out better than the other depending on what the market does after the investment is made.  Since it is impossible to tell the future, they are both equally effective.  
If you have $10k to invest as a lump sum today and the market goes south for the next year, DCA would have been the better approach.  If the market goes up for the next year, lump sum was the best approach.  Now you can use odds in your favor when choosing lump sum.  If the market recently dropped 80%, lump sum would potentially have better odds of being the right move.  If the market recently went up 80%, DCA would be a safer play.
Where DCA does tend to have an advantage over lump sum is mentally.  While buying the asset when it is down 80% is likely the best approach statistically, most people do not make the purchase out of fear.  When it is up 80% they make the purchase out of greed setting themselves up for failure.  DCA takes the decision making away from the investor and can become more effective over time.  It only takes one bad move with lump sum to financially wreck you for a long period of time.

Again, unless you can read the future, it is impossible to know which method will perform better going forward.  We can look at the past and assume what might happen in the future but it is just that, an assumption.  
Then you also get into people's confidence and ability to hold.  If someone puts in $20k today and it drops 50% next month, they are much more likely to have second thoughts and take their losses (I.e. 2017).  You can't compare cryptocurrency to traditional financial markets.  This is a very volatile space with extreme risk.  While it is pretty safe to say the equities markets will still be here in 10 years, the same can not be said about Bitcoin.  
It is all up to the individual and what their own tolerances are.  With the unkown's in this space, I would argue most people would be more successful taking the modest approach.  Setting up an automatic weekly or monthly buy is much less stressful to the majority than going all in on day one.

I have $100k I want to put into Bitcoin, which is going to make me more or lose me less money?  $100k *all in* (understand that?) on day 1 or $10k a month for 10 months? 


That's not playing the market.  That is accepting your losses and moving your money to something else that will make you money.  Not every investment is a winner.  Do you not understand opportunity cost?  Hodling through every crash works until it doesn't.  We are talking the majority here.  The majority of Bitcoin investors are normal everyday people.  They don't have nerves of steel.  Thus, we get a crash.  


Context!  Like above, if I want to put a $100k into Bitcoin and I put it "all in" on day one, I am effectively all in.  All in does not mean I have to use every last penny of my net worth, no one does that.  It simply means you are all in with what you are willing to invest.


Seriously?  Risk is irrelevant?  


We are not talking a penny stock.  Your article you quoted earlier spoke of a traditional, semi conservative 60/40 stock/bond investment.  Far cry from a penny stock or Bitcoin.


In the past during a specific time frame.  You keep forgetting that part.  More so earlier in Bitcoin's life than in the past few years.  The past does not tell the future.  You can keep assuming the outcome will continue to be the same all you want.  It is just an assumption.

And you may be appreciating your losses if it goes the other way.  You can argue that lump sum will always be the better approach all you want.  Fact is, it *can* be the worst move you make.  Stop forgetting when the average person decides to buy.  Neither approach is guaranteed to be better than the other going forward, overall or on average.  That is fact.

I'm sorry, "Impossible to know which will perform better on average in the future".  Same difference.
If Bitcoin went in a downward spiral and you felt it was never going to recover you could simply stop buying.  If you are "all in" you have already maximized your losses.  There is no comparison between speculating in Bitcoin and investing in equities.  This is by far the riskiest space to put your money.  I am not stating one method is better than the other.  No one knows.  Pick your poison.

It looks like it is supposed to be that way?  Both B's are the same way.

A powerloss does not force close any channels.  The channels just become inactive until both nodes are back online and in sync.
@_date: 2019-12-01 18:47:32
Ultimately, there is no problem with a node going offline due to power failure.  As long as you let the node fully sync the channel states before closing channels or sending funds, nothing will happen.

Complete rip off.  Around here those charge upwards of 20% fee.

I would come out and tell Craig Wright he has 24 hours to move his coins to a new address or otherwise I will do it for him.

Yeah, this is my third transfer with them and usually it shows up there by the end of the business day if I send it early enough.

There will always be inequality amongst people regardless of what the means of exchange is.  People are inherently unequal.

If the cost to run them requires a 20% fee, it's probably best to not run them.  How many people's first experience to Bitcoin is one of these machines only to discover they have to give up 20% to purchase some?  Many probably chuckle, write it off as a scam like they heard and don't look back.  It's just a bad image imo.
