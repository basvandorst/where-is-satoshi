Oh wow had no clue it was until July/August. I will for sure not be buying one of these then.

From there twitter, "Maintenance Over however we are now under a DDoS attack."

Judging from the picture someone found it and stole your BTC? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:45:56
All depends on what your mining with. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:38:25
Crazy how fast it just rises in one night lately. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:27:14
It's down for me is it for you? 
Edit: Never mind just loaded. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:08:52
I'm going to say up because I have faith in BTC! 
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:21:43
Just people manipulating the price so they can buy low and wait till its high to sell Hugh again. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:44:32
I read that you can buy with paypal but less people sell because its risky through paypal and credit card. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:29:20
If that's the case I'm sorry even though it was a small amount! 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:01:10
Sorry to hear that happened! :( we've all been scammed and been there and it sucks. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:07:31
I had a feeling it would end by this happening. sabiWabi will always be known to ruin it. Thanks for doing what you do. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:25:37
Lots of addresses. I'm not completely sure but I think your wallet was hacked? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:06:53
I was just thinking about this and it sounds like a good idea to me as well.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:11:29
Yea I think it's going to make its way back up to 200s now slowly but surely. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:40:41
Yea I was reading the same sort of stuff which is the reason I did not buy one yet. Thanks for the info. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:41:30
Well if its below 70C I don't think any harm at all is being caused. Maybe its something else. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:40:27
I would say now for sure they just raised a ton in a few minutes! 
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:16:39
Maybe it is being stressed and needs a break? I have no clue I'm just guessing.
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:37:32
Yea I figured, I already reported him.
@_date: 2013-07-17 01:38:45
College students. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:42:21
I wish he would do a AMA he seems like a cool guy but he turned it down. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:17:39
Well I'm not 100% sure but I think it will go back up gradually. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:44:51
I think there actually being DDOSed now so it will drop more. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:08:42
It dropped from lag I believe and I'm not buying in yet. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:22:02
Price seems to be taking a huge toll wow. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:36:54
Alright but if they did ship within two months there would be profit made correct? I probably will not invest in these.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:15:00
Exactly what I think is going to happen.  Somehow the price will rise back up.
