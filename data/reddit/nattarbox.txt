Which I think is why many people preferred combining Segwit with a blocksize increase, which would have provided immediate scaling and fee relief to 100% of bitcoin users, buying time for Segwit adoption to happen afterwards and further scale the network.

The card issuer determines wether it’s a purchase or a cash advance, not Coinbase.

@_date: 2018-01-26 16:31:50
Coinbase is already a second layer solution, fully centralized. As fees go up, more people will choose to only transact with other Coinbase customers and merchants, to avoid pricey and unreliable on-chain spends. They aren't going to use Lightning, they're going to compete with it.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:23:00
If you don’t want competing forks, maybe work a little more on collaborating with different groups and ideas working on bitcoin instead of driving them out? ��
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:10:26
Also important to understand that the situation resulting in high fees was a roadmap choice by the core devs, and that blaming it on Coinbase is just about the stupidest thing ever.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:53:07
Decentralized network = they can do whatever they want.
Seems like an obvious business decision that setting huge fees that guarantee inclusion in the next block is better than dealing with the customer support load from a bunch of cyrpto noobs wondering why their transaction is pending for 20+ minutes.
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:13:58
Not sure but they usually have a much higher APR than regular purchases. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:38:04
FYI if we are petitioning a private company to adopt segwit, because they control such a massive chunk of BTC transactions, centralization already happened. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:44:29
We could bump up the blocksize which scales the whole network independent of private companies for a start. :)
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:51:47
Fees are ~$20 right now. If you wallet has less than the required fee, you can't spend. Or you can try, and it'll get stuck somewhere.

@_date: 2017-12-15 17:57:51
Why would fees drop? Maxed out Segwit blocks still wouldn't be enough to process the number of transactions, leading to a backlog, leading to fees. We'd be in the exact same spot.
Meanwhile the majority of Coinbase's users are operating offchain already and could care less either way.

To cash it out, go to Settings and change your currency to USD. This sells the bitcoin for cash, which you can withdraw to a debit card or bank account. 
You can also send it to a different wallet. Circle will cover the enormous fee to do that for you, won’t cost you anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:50:13
You might be dumb. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:32:06
Name one reason why Coinbase would prioritize Segwit over literally anything else they could be building.
The only benefit Segwit would offer to Coinbase users is potentially lowering the fee on transferring bitcoin out to a private wallet. Do you think that is a priority for a company that frequently cites numbers about assets under management? And do you think the wave of speculative investors that pushed them up to the  app in the app store care about that?
Guess why they won't adopt the Lightning network either.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:23:59
Go into Settings in Circle and change your currency to “USD”. This will sell your bitcoin balance for cash, and then you can withdraw it to a bank or debit card. 
Note that you can’t change your currency back to BTC on Circle after you do this, it’s a one way street. 
The Coinbase price when you sell is lower than their quoted price and probably about the same as what you’ll get in Circle. You might want to double check that first. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:55:17
Why is everyone hopped up on Coinbase implementing Segwit? It won't meaningfully impact fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:29:58
Coinbase will charge a small percent to sell and withdraw it to a bank, yeah. Circle is free for that as well.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:43:13
damn good joe
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:39:13
It’s been four months since segwit was launched and is at 10%. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:14:45
You're missing the point. Coinbase customers can buy, hold, and sell from within Coinbase's walled garden without ever touching the blockchain. They can spend offchain, instantly and for free, on websites where they see the Coinbase logo (Shopify is using this instead of Bitpay now).
Fees, Segwit, and Lightning Network don't matter to these people, and as the primary entry point for bitcoin, they now greatly outnumber those of us who stash coins on a Trezor under the mattress.
Coinbase knows this, and they prioritize their product roadmap appropriately.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:19:38
It’s pretty easy as a bitcoin company employee to tell the difference between a small group of angry Reddit users making politically motivated product demands, and requests from actual users. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:50:47
Coinbase is already the biggest and best implementation of a side chain. Probably the vast majority of the users they're adding now never touch the blockchain at all.
Not sure why they'd bother spending resources on adding Lightning now that bitcoin is only used as a speculative investment.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:56:11
You people are so clueless. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:14:50
Because that would double your exposure to fees that are currently almost $40 and growing.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:07:36
I'd prefer to think of it as intentional than just incompetence.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:23:38
I don't know. But it isn't unusual for new technologies to take time to be adopted. It looks like a long road to get to full Segwit adoption required to make Lightning feasible.

Yes, BTC at Circle is insured.
A lot of folks at Reddit got burned when Mt. Gox collapsed, hence the meme of encouraging others to not store their bitcoin at places like Circle and Coinbase. This can be bad advice for two reasons:
1. Circle and Coinbase are completely different companies than Mt. Gox, designed from the ground up to be reliable and insured.
2. Storing bitcoin on your own personal computer in a safe way is actually pretty technical and difficult. Any sort of hardware failure could lose your coins forever, and lots of malware now targets local bitcoin deposits.

If you want to connect a debit card, it should be entered in the card section for adding an account, which is instant.
What you did with the verification process was to connect the bank account associated with your debit card. It takes a few days to verify because of ACH, but the upside is you'll be able to deposit and withdraw without any fees.

They defined withdrawal as selling your BTC and having the money transferred to a fiat account.

This is literally the exact scenario they want to catch with this info.
@_date: 2016-11-16 21:27:47
There is a discount for cash on many things (gas), and small businesses will also offer discounts for paying with cash, although card networks can cancel their service if they catch them doing it. You'll also find small businesses that only take cash, this is generally to get around the cost of card processing and avoid the hell of chargebacks.
But more often, people who pay with cash are getting extra screwed because they're paying the marked up price that includes the card transaction.

This dismissive crap needs to stop. Paypal is a walled garden, as are all the card networks, ACH, SWIFT, etc. You have to beg them to let you use their network, and they can kick you off at any time.

$20 is a pretty big hit for someone investing, say, a couple hundred bucks from each paycheck. And that would be on top of whatever fees the exchange charges.

I tried this out during a winter vacation and aside from the novelty of paying with bitcoin, I got to experience one of the major consumer benefits it offers over the existing payment system:
Expedia itself sucks. I've had prior experience with them and knew this going in, but I was still excited to book travel with bitcoin. When I was checking in at the hotel, the front desk informed me that Expedia had reserved two rooms instead of the one I requested. Classic Expedia. 
I can only assume that if I had used a pull payment method (credit card), I would have been charged for both rooms and had to deal with talking to up to three entities (hotel, Expedia, credit card company). Since it was bitcoin, I had sent them the agreed upon amount at booking and that was the end of it.

From his perspective, that is exactly what Circle's USD offering will enable. He can add $1 to his account, and six months later have exactly $1 in his balance. He can send that $1 to someone, and that action will deduct exactly $1 from his balance.
The friend at Coinbase who receives that $1 worth of bitcoin might find that it is worth a little more or less, but such is the nature of currency exchange. ;)

Looking at the lack of progress over the past 5 years, and the total atrophy of Bitcoin-as-payment activity in the same timeframe, that seems like a profoundly stupid prediction.

I replied to you on my own Reddit.
@_date: 2015-02-18 13:16:22
Thank you. Very few people in the Bitcoin community understand how hard these companies work to fight off fraud and provide a good service to the honest users.

Good luck with that

A primetime 30s commercial [could be up to $300k every time it airs]( in addition to the cost of production. You can't click through on a TV ad, so the results would be negligible and impossible to measure.
Not to mention the broadcast/print magazine demographics are entirely wrong for bitcoin. Not time for this stuff yet.

I've recently started printing my own newspaper.

The problem isn't "blockchains don't scale".
The problem is "bitcoin can't implement any of the possible ways to make them scale".
Now we'll see if ETH and others can.

Right here: 
You should be able to increase it to $3000 without issue.

Living the futurist dream! Congrats. Who cares if it works financially, the adventure is in the journey.

You’re an intentional retard.

Considering the three year stalemate has choked off all meaningful development and VC activity, not to mention merchant support, probably never. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:23:06
this might be a shock, but regular people don't know how to make buy/sell orders on an exchange, and don't want to wait a week to sign up and have their utility bills reviewed
@_date: 2016-07-07 17:34:38
Probably specifically for an Asian subsidy company.
@_date: 2016-07-29 18:04:08
Use a debit card instead of credit on Circle, zero fees.
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:29:51
Exchanges are not the same thing. You ask a beginner to upload a utility bill and wait a week for their account, guess what they're going to do.

bitcoin is valuable because i can sell it for more USD than i bought it for
@_date: 2016-07-06 20:20:31
Such bull. I can trust someone to secure and insure my bitcoin while still taking advantage of other benefits. Not all of us are trying to gamble and buy drugs.

Sweet paying capital gains on my groceries is definitely an improvement.
