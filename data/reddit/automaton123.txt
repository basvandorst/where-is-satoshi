You made my brains hurt. So by your logic, we shouldn't do anything about climate change until it's too late , when the effects are apparent, am I right.

The thing about having it on bitcoin,  is that it is global. Anybody can have it regardless of country . In countries with archaic laws and no hope of getting such a forward thinking law in the near future , blockchain can disrupt that and directly pay to every human in the world.
Yes, indentifying unique individuals is a challenge but I believe it can be solved. There are already people working on it. We can use technologies such as Civic  is already doing ! Or, off the top of my head , implement limits such has having 1 tx a month for the past year so only active , old  addresses get to receive it.

Hah, try something new. Seen this from a mile away.

If you read through my entire text again and still couldn't understand the scope of what I'm talking about when it's been simplified to the fullest,  I'm not sure who's the stupid one here..

Read this. How would you expect to solve such a problem should we encounter it in the future ? We should start talking about it now, regardless of skill level.

I do not know, which is why I am asking for the opinion of the community, especially of developers. A BIP or other highly focused project like Lightning network could be implemented without forking ,  with the right expertise. At worst case , a fork for supporters vs non supporters of UBI but that's neither likely nor desirable.

Thank you for your sensible and intelligent answer ! It is rare indeed. I've actually thought of many ways about it. Since basic income is essentially a wealth transfer from the top to the bottom to avoid creating inflation and bridge the wealth gap, it may be needed that the biggest holding addresses of bitcoin might have to pay for it.
One such way to decide on this is having the entire network vote for it like how we did for Segwit,  1x, 2x,  etc.
Projects such as Horizon State and district0x are also working on community based governance to make decentralised decisions such as this.

Sure, if you're only in it for the money e.g. Hodl until the price is high enough and then sell. 
Most of us here want Bitcoin to succeed and will hold out till the end when every last coin is mined, and Bitcoin is widely adopted. And at that point, we won't have to sell anymore and yet retain the buying power of today at the same time.
It's the philosophy behind bitcoin which will take years, decades,  into 2030 on to 2050 even, to be fully realised. Of which I think will probably go over much of the newbies' heads.

So that seems decent as $0.10 would be 10 satoshis.
Apparently a million USD per BTC would be the sweet spot. That means if it increases more to 10 million usd/BTC for example then it would be 1 Satoshi for 10 cents. Seems like the maximum limit before it starts to get messy for purchases under $1. Am i right?

What kind of barbaric and idiotic species we must be if we funnel our hard-earned resources to the Have's and neglect the Have-nots? Sounds so much like the starting plot of a horror movie, it must be a joke hahahaha....hahaha....haha...ha... :`(
Edit: I should add a /s as judging from the downvotes people don't get sarcasm.
