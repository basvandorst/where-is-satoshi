Fuck this noise. I'm happy to pay my share of taxes if it means I get to live in a safe society where people can get a good education, healthcare and infrastructure is well maintained and developed.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:05:11
I guess you could go and live completely off grid, be completely self-sufficient and not interact with society in any way?
Or accept the fact that you live in a society and that we all need to contribute to keep it functioning.

I've got a zipped, passworded text file that contains all the details on how to get at my crytpo funds saved on my Google Drive. The password is a 30+ character phrase that only one relative (who I trust *and* is much richer than me) knows.
Using [Google's Inactive Account Manager]( - if anything ever happens to me, after 3 months of inactivity that relative will get access to my Google Drive and the special instructional file.

I'm relatively well off, but also realise that I live in a society and it benefits *me* if infrastructure is maintained, schools are free to attend and well funded, garbage is collected, healthcare is universal and that there's a social safety net to support those who fall upon hard times.  
  
Of course there's government corruption and wasteful spending and that pisses me off, but that's a price I'm willing to pay to live in a happier, safer society. At least that's how it works here in Australia.

It depends what you’re into, but I absolutely love 99% Invisible, Twenty Thousand Hertz, The Daily, The Dollop, Pod Save America, Reply All, How I Built This, Download This Show, Planet Money, Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History, Sum of All Parts, Cosmic Vertigo, Slate’s Working and Flash Forward. 
For audiobooks I’ve been listening to Sapiens and am almost done with Homo Deus. Both books cover a short history of humanity and why we are the way we are and where we’re possibly heading.

He's been mining and holding and managing his stuff since the very early days. Didn't get stung by MtGox. Complete true believer and evangelist. Pretty much convinced that the world financial system is going to collapse sometime soon.
He hasn't cashed out at all, still working his day job in IT Support and keeping a low profile. Seems to have done all the right things and I'm pretty sure he's a BTC multi-millionaire but he keeps quiet about how much he has. He did mention to me that he got into ETH when it around $2!

Same here in Sydney. Prices on property anywhere within 10KM(6 miles) of downtown have not gone down in over 30 years. More people keep moving in, prices are highly unlikely to go down.

I followed this rule. My wife and I have a small apartment which we've paid off, no plans to move or have kids and no debt at all. We have a couple of other small investments, but BTC is quite special.
If we lost what we've put into BTC we'd more than a bit bummed, but we'd be in absolutely no financial danger whatsoever.
People seeing the massive gains and thinking they'll get into crypto and "get rich quick" are in for a shock. It's been very exciting watching the numbers go up so much this year, but I'm in it for the long haul. Hoping it'll be a life changing amount of money in a few years and we'll be able to retire to a nice beach house a little earlier than we'd planned.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:22:59
I purchased a small chunk at $13K, now at $10.5K. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

I purchased a game about 18 months ago that is now "worth" 15X what I paid for it.

I’m still getting my head around all this, but I’ve been watching the mempool over the last few days and it’s dropped from 290K to 170K - would this be at all related to increased adoption of Segwit?

My wife has been encouraging me to buy more and more BTC, while *I've* been the one to be more cautious. I keep her updated as to what's happening every day. 
There seems to be a lot of bitter of dudes in here in bad relationships.

People who purchased bitcoin a few years ago have seen the value go up and down, but mostly up. There's no guarantee that it'll keep going up, but that's the way the trend is. People who got in early have generally been quite lucky. 
Except the guy who purchased a pizza for 10,000 BTC back in the day. He's probably regretting that.
An individual bitcoin used to be able to be exchanged for a few cents US, the exchange rate is now over US$1200/btc.
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:32:27


What kind of work do you do where everyone you deal with is willing to pay you in BTC?
@_date: 2016-06-14 04:45:58
Eh, I still use my somethingawful account and it was registered in November, 2000
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:53:55
I don't know, when I was 16 I spent around $2K (my entire life savings and earnings) on a shiny new PC. Over 20 years later and I'm looking at upgrading my PC and I'm really hesitant to drop that kind of cash ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.
If I were OP, I'd save 80% of that cash as BTC and use the remainder as "fun money". And then regret not putting that remainder into BTC a couple of years later :)
@_date: 2016-06-14 04:52:16
Damn. I have a grand total of 2 bitcoins that I purchased last year just for funsies so I rarely check on the price. They've gone up almost 150% since I purchased them. :D
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:33:26
Way down!
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:54:39
The bottom of the trough is now $4K.

Based on all his other media appearances I'd already lost respect for Ver. Screaming into the camera and giving everyone the finger was the bottom of the barrel.
