I think it’ll definitely go up and / or down. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:57:40
I’m sure the graph would be similar if you used total market cap. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:48:53
Same here. 
I have used bank transfer with Bittylicious and never had an issue. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:25:07
You should have put it against that “market sentiment” GIF that’s been doing the rounds for years. 
Then I’d believe it, again!!!
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:39:01
I’m pretty sure their isn’t. 
Drop them a note, they are on here, maybe they would appreciate the suggestion. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:38:24
Yeah you do have to check the price, but also bear in mind that all fees are included so if you buy 1BTC, that’s what lands in your wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:36:22
At the beginning, page 1
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:22:57
Bittylicious 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:22:21
I have used it numerous times in the UK, and never met in person. 
Choose a high feedback buyer and don’t release BTC until payment has been received. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:57:29
Maybe it was Satoshi himself. 
Although he must have time travelled ��
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:52:05
He asks for both. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:33:55
7/10. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:34:19
I think I’m happy with it being a store of value, and use something else for day to day spends. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:49:31
Ace video. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:36:16
Fishy. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:12:39
Fair enough, I missed that. 
I had actually been wondering why it was always going up when I was watching it, didn’t realise it dropped when a block is mined. 
Thanks for that. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:22:54
Ouch, bet it went through quick!!!
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:52:36
Driving in to work at the moment in the UK, and just heard on the radio - “Treasury crackdown on Bitcoin over concerns it is used to launder money and dodge tax”. 
Great!!! ��
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:41:10
Shitcoin wanker?
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:19:24
I’m sure that will come with time. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:51:34
I think we are at the first blip bear trap. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:07:09
Please don’t put that on the family Christmas card!!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:34:46
Jeez just imagine that for one second. 
£200,000 sat in your house!!!! For free. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:37:47
I’m sorry, I’m from the UK so don’t know. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:08:45
Brilliant post. Much information. 
Just what we need. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:25:50
Bitcoin’s price maximum in 2010 was $0.39
Bitcoin’s price maximum thus far in 2017 is about $11,800.00
That’s just over 32,000 higher in 7 years. 
To get from $11,800 to $500,000 is just 42 times. 
It’s unlikely, but not beyond the realms of possibility. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:47:11
Getting there......
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:10:45
Put them in a pan over a very hot stove. 
When they melt, the real bitcoin is inside. 
If it says “shitcash” then throw it in the bin and run!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:40:36
Both, but in different ways ��
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:36:34
Annoying, but wouldn’t affect me in any way. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:40:36
Too much info to take in!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:07:48
You just have the public address?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:18:14
Cracking story, best of luck &amp; happy Christmas to you 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:28:28
Surely they would know the private key, no?
Then wait until after Xmas and clear out all wallets!!!
Make your own for free!!
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:49:20
She is very sweet. 
Hope she enjoys her Christmas gifts. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:31:01
Awesome idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:52:07
That guy is a bellend of epic proportions. 
I can’t comprehend how he still gets screen time. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:08:19
It’s going up on my screen. 
I’m looking at blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:20:27
If you can do it, that’s mighty impressive.
Fingers crossed for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:23:50
Lol. I’m old too. 
He was obviously putting pennies on each one, could have put 1btc on each, tightwad ��
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:39:40
Yes, and it’s clear some people don’t know how it works. 
They use escrow so it’s safe, and it can all be done online, meeting in person is only one option. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:21:07
Sounds like I need to get on this discord thing!!!
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:01:45
My first thought that it was related to market cap and taunting the altcoins. 
But I guess it can be read in a different way. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:30:28
Don’t start the guy off!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:23:10
Agreed (hoping)
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:06:24
Ah, thanks for that. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:23:37
Same here. 
I’ll give them my inside leg measurements too, don’t really care. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:59:57
I’d say we were at “media attention“ stage. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:49:04
I use Bittylicious. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:10:10
This is really beginning to worry me now, if I’m completely honest. 
I’m a big BTC believer but can see things happening that I don’t like. 
Roger seems relentless, seems to be buying very high profile BCH shills, and there doesn’t appear to be any quick fixes coming for BTC to bridge the gap. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:25:18
Not sure that has anything to do with it. 
A profit on property isn’t issued by the state but you pay tax on the gain. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:05:31
Ha ha. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:55:49
This is my thinking. Although not ideal, it was pretty much inevitable. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:30:09
I really wish I could just forget about it for 12 months!!!
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:35:06
Ouch, I bought two on eBay for £2.99
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:14:02
Dude, bitcoin wasn’t invented until 2009. 
Your story is impossible. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:03:45
I’ll pass thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:44:22
I think that’s entirely possible. 
I did. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:37:58
It uses Escrow. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:00:08
What’s BCC?
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:33:17
Let’s keep it that way!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:19:50
Shit or bust as we say in the UK. 
I sincerely wish you the best of luck with your gamble buddy. 
For the record, I think it’s a daft plan but nobody knows your situation better than you. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:15:07
Interesting concept of title and body being identical. 
Nice one
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:16:16
Thanks. I understand the damage / loss part but confused about the “done incorrectly “ bit. 
Can you expand?
I assumed it was a case of, create a paper wallet offline, print and load currency?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:47:57
I’m with you. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:51:39
I was surprised to look on Boxing Day evening and see 177K unconfirmed transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:58:47
No, it’s not just for meeting up locally. 
I have bought and sold on there numerous times without leaving my couch. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:34:26
I think this may well be correct. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:15:50
Yawn. 
If it’s going to fail, sell if you have any. Then you don’t need to care. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:54:10
I see. 
Who would actually ask for that?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:01:38
Looks as high as ever to me!!!!
276,000 or more.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:24:08
Just because somebody did good in the past, is not a reason to forgive future wankerishness. 
(Not sure it’s a real word, but it fits the bill). 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:11:42
Apart from saying you have top secret information from a bitcoin insider. 
Ok, I’ll call that false advertising for your utter rubbish post. 
Thanks though. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:48:03
Lol. Tried, failed. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:03:11
May I ask, 100K in which currency. 
And what is your starting balance? 100K is easy if you’re starting with 50 million. 
100K profit from 1K is a little more tricky. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:56:46
I like this guy. 
In fact, other than myself, he’s the only crypto guy I like. 
Other than the Doge clan of course!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:03:20
Agreed. 
You might airdrop me your shitcoins, but I’m not even going to do you the honour of claiming them.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:45:34
As long as I’m in the top 1%, it’s all good. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:32:44
It’s 10 million no?
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:00:44
Bittylicious 
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:12:47
No, it was on the Nick Ferrari show at about 7:35am
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:08:11
Why would you not want to pay your due taxes?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:05:17
Think there are 3 or 4 in the planning. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:13:26
I’d say it’s fine as it is. 
There would always need to be a “store of value” crypto, let another altcoin do the day to day transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:18:20
I’m with Hulk. Strong agree. 
Somebody needs to take the bull by the horns and sort this out, instead of burying heads in sand and waiting an undetermined time for LN. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:08:11
Same here. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:36:44
Lol, if that happens I’ll take my wife out!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:12:41
Please do ��
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:37:54
Almost every nocoiner I speak to doesn’t know this either. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:34:32
Flying under the radar???
I’m fed up of hearing about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:07:22
Fine by me ��
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:44:47
Hope it works out for you pal. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:33:34
I respect your position, but hopefully we can agree to disagree. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:30:00
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:17:24
Say wut?
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:39:18
Think it’s 11pm UK time
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:22:12
I have always resisted getting any BCH. 
BTC is here to stay (as long as somebody sorts mempool backlog and fees). 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:43:24
Thought they were interchangeable. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:00:11
Old one first, new one second. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:28:28
In my opinion, media attention and generally wider acceptance (of BTC by the public, not from vendors). 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:23:29
Debate away. 
It’s a national DAB station, don’t blame me if your Ford Capri doesn’t have digital radio!!!
London Taxis don’t just operate in London, Scottish Widows doesn’t just operate in Scotland. 
Free your mind ❤️
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:49:20
Bittylicious for me too
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:36:48
Why do we need to convince you?
Are you not clever enough to do your own due diligence and make your own mind up?
Why does it matter what we think? Everybody sees BTC in a different light. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:29:21
Don’t forget Will-I-am
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:48:07
I’m in it for the money. 
But I’m hoping BTC is the money!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:16:06
Maybe. 
Where was the coin stored? Any email clues?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:57:49
Lol. Shill
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:26:06
They really need to sort this shit out. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:48:50
Be confident, you didn’t help. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:59:48
Is there a problem with long term storage in paper wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:59:48
I appreciate your response, and sincerely hope you are wrong. 
I guess I’ll just sit back and enjoy the fireworks �� 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:24:19
Pretty much the same story in our local paper today also. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:54:09
I don’t worry about them. 
They will either be killed for their wealth, or be too covered in coke &amp; prostitutes to bother me. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:50:19
Next target is sorting scaling and reducing the unconfirmed transactions and high fees. 
Once that’s done, then we can worry about adoption. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:36:05
Give me £10K and I’ll be excited!!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:06:06
Love it. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:56:46
Did my post get removed for trolling?
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:26:01
Indeed. 
I have never sold any of my BTC or alts, although I have given some away to get friends started. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:23:09
Yes, I believe you can. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:19:13
Is an investot like an investor but under 5?
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:54:56
I’d be buying also. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:07:59
Going down to $1000 is madness. 
Hitting $9K+ is adoption and awesome. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:17:44
That’s like worrying when you are in bed with a woman way out of your league. 
Enjoy the moment!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:42:34
Thanks very much for the explanation buddy. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:47:52
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:18:00
That is so cool, sorry for your loss. 
Oldest person (only person) I know personally holding BTC is me. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:40:55
Sounds awesome. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:27:49
A very good point, and one I have yet to do. 
My safe isn’t fireproof either ��
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:05:39
Increase the pitiful ATM coverage?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:53:36
Don’t read that sub then. I don’t. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:26:30
Paper wallet for me also. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:13:29
I just hope they don’t think you can only buy one bitcoin, and not fractions there of. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:38:54
I’m not sure you correctly understand how bitcoin works buddy. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:04:02
We are talking about the ECB here buddy, if you live in the EU you’ll be aware what a bunch of feckless spanners they are. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:26:10
There are loads around mate. 
I just printed one off (offline) and sent my coins to it. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:37:14
It’s useful if you don’t want it to go through your bank account and is a little more “off grid”. 
I couldn’t really comment on the tax implications buddy. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:47:51
I’d love one but I’m in the UK ��
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:42:37
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:04:32
Same here!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:02:25
Do you suggest an update to BTC or a complete replacement?
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:11:59
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:18:48
You, and only you, control the paper. 
If you keep it safe, it’s pretty impenetrable. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:11:35
I remember everybody saying this at around £500 BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:34:34
My Doge ate mine!
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:08:00
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:16:45
Sorry, but that’s not exactly a year!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:55:45
Then go for it. 
10% premium in some cases, but I have been happy to pay that at times in the past for sheer simplicity. 
Good on you for starting saving / investing at your age. Wish I’d have been that sensible. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:15:48
I have used Bittylicious before. 
Paid by bank transfer, fees are a little high, but it’s super easy and instant. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:13:45
Looks good, what Fiat currencies does it support?
Can you set up a crypto Portfolio?
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:46:50
I was a tad worried about this when I read the title. 
Although I’m sure it is actually happening somewhere!!!
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:07:00
I must admit, I did wonder if most things hit big volatility at the start (well, kind of). 
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:22:52
Exactly what I have done. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:45:30
Possibly, haven’t really looked into it properly but as I said, it may be an option. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:34:15
Yeah I read that too. 
I’m outta ideas!!!
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:11:41
Another Bittylicious fan here. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:58:02
You need to read more, there have been numerous discussions about selling. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:23:22
I do wonder if it will hit $10K before November is done!!!
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:04:23
I’d say half way through innovators.

Love the idea. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:28:13
Paper gold doesn’t help either!!!!
Oh if only everybody cashed in their paper contracts ��
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:35:27
Ha ha, you can more than halve that ��. 
Your grandads record is safe. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:59:37
Awesome ��

If only everyone would cash in their paper precious metals ��

Maybe I was asking about BCC?

Maybe a good way to cash out though on the sly.

Same here. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:58:05
Is there a premium involved or some sort of commission?
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:05:59
Bitcoin on a loin?
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:47:17
And who is going to audit my wallet when it doesn’t exist?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:15:07
Because they don’t have bitcoin. 
I called the housing market a bubble when I didn’t have exposure.

Horrendous English, got annoyed after 2 lines.

Little cottage in Wales for me, one day maybe. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:38:33
Yes. Have used many times. 
Fees can be a bit high sometimes so check, but it’s amazingly simple. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:04:26
Ha ha, glad you got it. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:21:05
I work in a company of 30 people. 
If I never mentioned it, only one other employee would know about BTC. 
I have spoken about it, and only one more showed any sort of vague interest, but never purchased. 
Imagine when the majority of them want in?
One guy always speaks about how much spare cash he has. I remember urging him to buy BTC when it was £125. I suggested a £10K purchase and he almost did it but was ultimately too afraid (or tight). 
Looking forward to telling him tomorrow that he’d be sitting on £550K now ��

Nice one, I only have a half and I’m dying to get to a full coin, cash permitting. 
Well done mate. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:39:11
Did he sell?
Did you hodl?
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:18:38
Completely agree. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:15:12
It’s probably multiple people. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:39:43
Don’t forget to put an “o” at the end of the word also. 
El thankso 
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:17:16
The same as for the last few years. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:40:47
I’d be interested in this too. 
I was very close to putting 10K(£) in when BTC was £125. 
If, and that’s a big if, I still had them now, they would be worth £400K. 
That’s mortgage paid, cottage in the country, boom.

How does it cope with the polymer notes?
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:06:35
Ha ha, awesome. That made my Friday. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:12:39
I think about 16M BTC are out there. 
Only a trillionaire could buy them all, even if they were all available. 
As soon as he bought the first big batch, the price would rocket meaning they could never own them all. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:47:13
Good point, that’s why I said it “maybe” an option. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:20:37
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:55:45
I only have a half ��
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:24:45
I thought most businesses did an immediate exchange into fiat. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:45:09
I want one!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:44:49
Nope. 
Need 0.5BTC more and then I’m set for moon. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:15:44
A whole one? 
Well Gel
