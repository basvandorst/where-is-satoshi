It's a Noah's Ark trinket. It's a story. Relax.
The Western/Anglo literary tradition is constructed almost entirely atop three major foundations: The Bible, Greco-Roman mythology and philosophy, and Shakespeare. Pretty much everything else is more or less derivative.
Regardless of my beliefs (or lack thereof), my kids are *absolutely* going to read The Bible, cover-to-cover, and be extremely well-versed in it. They'll enjoy the stories and myths, and be able to, as adults, go toe-to-toe with any fundamentalist.

I memorized my twelve words by *mentally reciting them daily*, multiple times per day. It took discipline, but my efforts paid off. My deterministic wallet passphrase became my mantra.
Now it's completely committed to memory. I'll never forget it. I'll be spouting off those 12 words as a crazy old man, long after I've forgotten what they're for.
The only place that passphrase exists is in my head, period. I trust that more than I trust paper, QR codes, or hardware devices. I can literally have nothing, and know that I can recover those coins. That's cool to me.
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:00:39
I saw your app on the App Store! Downloaded it, haven't loaded it up yet.
The "other app" I loaded my deterministic wallet into was a web wallet. Now I can't remember which one! But I can look in my browser history.
Is it dumb to load deterministic wallets (using my 12-word passcode) into web wallets? Do they have my private key now?
Web wallets (coinbase and the like), be they deterministic or normal, are a matter of trust anyway, no?
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:09:25
Oh, so, it generates a new key each time? Your explanation is helping; I feel like I'm on the brink of understanding...
Does it generate new addresses, too? I'm a bit unclear about the relationship between keys and addresses... Multiple addresses can belong in a wallet, protected by a single key... Or, in this case, a new *related* key that we trust (somehow) every time we import the wallet into new software using the 12 word seed...
Am I close? Or off the mark?
@_date: 2014-08-20 17:26:23
I tend to agree with you, and bits is a sensible default long-term. It'd just be nice to be able to change the default until such time. That said, it's a small thing, and I'm not taking the time to fork it on github and add it, so not a huge deal to me. :)
@_date: 2014-08-19 17:47:52
I like Hive and Breadwallet. I haven't settled on a favorite yet. 
Breadwallet doesn't (afaik) allow you to change denominations (from bits to mBTC, for example). My single small "complaint."
Hive take too long (imo) to verify the PIN when you enter it. Other than that, though, it's real nice.
@_date: 2014-08-17 22:53:56
Ok, your app is pretty dope. Simple, easy to use, and attractive. Good job!
Quick question, and I'm sure this is dumb, but anyway I ask: given that the seed is simply *12 common English words*, couldn't someone just write a script to run through a dictionary, concatenate 12 random words together with a space, and then wait until they hit upon a wallet with coins in it? It might take a bit of time, but if this thing just sits in the background quietly running... There are a finite number of words after all.
I ask, because my 12 words didn't seem all that extraordinary - like something a simple word jumbler could come up with, given enough time.

It's not just about getting a Bitcoin customer - it can also be about being perceived as "on top of" the latest tech trends. It can be a promotional tool as much as anything. "We do BITCOIN! We're young, hip, avant-guard, smart, and edgy!"
In any case, he charged for a service people are willing to pay for. Having this cool "Bitcoin" thing is worth a one-time out-lay of $400 to them. The $400 is for the privilege of not having to learn all this shit yourself - someone else does it all for you. $400, now you look "Bitcoin smart."
Trading services for money people are willing to pay. That's kind of how Capitalism works.
I charge people to write code for them. Yes, they could learn how to do it themselves, and get it done for "free," but they have other shit they want to do instead. So they pay me.

Alternative implementations will promote anti-fragility, and fortify the specification over time. The *whole point* of a "protocol" is that it should be implementation-independent to begin with.
In any case, doesn't the specification call for a "version" flag to be sent with every handshake? Sounds to me like this is what that flag was designed for.

He brought up something towards the end that I had discovered for myself: I was confused about Bitcoin when I first heard about it, of course; but as I dug deeper into it, I realized that, on a fundamental philosophical level, I don't really understand what money "is" either. It forced me to really try and figure it out.
I exchange my labor for these things called "dollars" - it really is all pretty weird. Money is fucking weird, and we don't really acknowledge that in our daily lives, because we're simply used to it.
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:12:18
Until Bitcoin clients make it simple and easy to reset a forgotten password, it's a no-go for most people.
For now, a forgotten passphrase == you're fucked, and that simply won't fly for gramma or cousin Susan. Your bank lets you reset a forgotten password. Bitcoin client authors need get to work on this.
Mass adoption won't happen until we solve the "one little slip up == lose all your money" problem.

This is how the banks will fight back. I foresee more of this in the future.
Make it more difficult to enter into the Bitcoin economy, and they'll hope to strangle it at a critical choke point: stifle "recruitment."
Most ("normal") people who want to play with Bitcoin will walk away and say "fuck it" if it's difficult to convert dollars to bitcoins and back.
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:25:53
Yes, I trust myself. I use a brainwallet. If I ever acquire a large sum, I may migrate funds to a "cold" paper wallet, but for now, my "warm" wallet is fine, and safe.
I wrote my passphrase down once, and repeated it daily, every morning, noon, and night - as a mantra of sorts. It's my personal incantation: a magickal spell that makes money available, anywhere, out of the ether (so long as I have a scrying mirror [smart phone] with me).
I destroyed my paper copy on the second day.
Now the passphrase is burned into my brain. It only took a week to do. I'll never forget it. I may forget what it's *for* before I forget the actual passphrase.
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:20:55
Oh, ok, it was Hive's web wallet app. Which looks pretty much exactly like their iPhone app. Their iPhone app could just be a Webkit wrapper for their website, then.
The key to widespread adoption of Bitcoin, I think, is making the system more idiot-proof and "safe." Most normal people aren't taking basic security measures, and don't make regular backups (much less would they do something as involved as "cold storage", or doing cold/warm/hot wallet setups...). Deterministic wallets are a step in the right direction IMO.
Regular people want something as easy to set up and use as a debit card (thing Amex Serve). In my mind, not being able to reset a lost password (although I understand the reasons why) is a GIANT barrier to regular-people-use of Bitcoin. Lost your Bitcoin password? Tough shit. The bank will let you reset your password with them, though, but with Bitcoin you're fucked if you forget.
I'm not an idiot, but I'm very busy and a bit lazy (well, not lazy - really just tired with little free time), so guys like me ("second-wave" adopters, as it were) are a good test-bed for these ideas I suppose. Because if there is to be a "third-wave," those fuckers really aren't going to bother reading and learning all this shit. :)

How many 12 word systems are there?
@_date: 2014-11-18 12:33:47
Not sure that makes me feel any better, though. :)
Don't get me wrong, I get it, the Bitcoin thing. At the same time, artificially enforced scarcity in order to promote "value," is pretty fucking weird. Money and capitalism, though, weird shit. I have a love/hate relationship with it all I guess. On the one hand, too many bitcoins devalues them; on the other hand, a scarcity means there will never be enough for everybody - people will be left out. Artificial scarcity rubs me wrong a little bit, especially when it's digital, but that's what makes it work too.
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:55:41
So, just to be clear, then, I don't need to back anything up? If my device is reformatted or stolen, and all I have is the 12-word seed, but I *do* have it (committed to memory), then I'm *guaranteed* to be able to re-constitute the private keys, and therefore, never lose bitcoins.
Craziness. All clients should move to this ASAP, then.

An adult observation.
Western Union is a company, comprised of human beings. They offer a service, needed by many, for a fee - providing jobs for people and a profit for shareholders in the process.

I'm stupid, granted, but I have no idea why gold and silver are any more "real" as money than Federal Reserve notes. Why are gold and silver valued? I don't know. It's just metal.
Or why are Bitcoins valued exactly? Let's face it: the "scarcity" of Bitcoins is made up, by design. 21 million is an arbitrary number. It's contrived scarcity.
*All* money seems like artificial, shared hallucination to me. Bitcoin is every bit as fake as fiat, and as fake as valuing diamonds or metals or shells. It's all really, really *weird*, isn't it?!
And yet it seems obvious that there's something "real" about it, because it "works" somehow; and also it is quite obvious that I really don't understand money at all, because if I did, I'd have far more of it. I understand it enough to make a comfortable living, but not enough to be completely beyond the game. That's very frustrating.
Honest question: *does anyone here actually understand money*? Like, *really* understand it!? If so, I want to learn. I don't get it. On the surface I do, like most people, but not *really*.

Most religious people absolutely do *not* talk and think like Dr. Peterson. I wish they did. 
Belief in the imminent return of a literal god-man, and valuing the archetypal character of the mythical man who speaks Truth as a model of optimal human aspiration are two *very* different things. Dr. Peterson calls himself "religious," but he's not in the way that most lay people understand it. He's playing with words when he calls himself "religious," in my opinion. By his definition, I'm very "religious" as well. But I do not attend or belong to a church, I don't identify with any religion, and I think organized religion is mostly bullshit. And Jesus ain't coming back. And yet I value the myths and stories as instructive in some sense, as Dr. Peterson describes. So... am I "religious" or not?

Fuck "politics." You can't just accuse 'n shit, and then write it off as "just politics" later, as if that's a pass.

Every transaction in life requires some degree of trust.
You trust that the waiter at a restaurant isn't going to poison you.
You trust that the people driving on the other side of the road aren't just going to swerve over and hit you.
Of course, trust is a risk calculation based on probability and affected by many variables, one of which includes probability of consequences.
There are high probability severe consequences for a waiter randomly poisoning somebody. Lower probability consequences for writing a subtly crooked Bitcoin client.
Since we're not all software engineers able to do sophisticated code review on software that interacts with a complex system (or even if we are, we have other shit to do), Bitcoin carries a higher risk of loss than other activities. And yet many of us still choose to fool around with it. We all have different risk appetites, and reward calculations.

With Bitcoin, I can carry millions of dollars worth of value across international borders, with nothing on me, using a 12 word passphrase *that I keep solely in my brain*.
PayPal can decide to shut me out, or freeze my assets. I have to trust and rely on PayPal. Or Google. Or whomever I decide is the gatekeeper to my funds. 
Bitcoin is a no-trust system. That's entirely the point.
