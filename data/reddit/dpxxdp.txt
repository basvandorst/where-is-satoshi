$400 is what we've collectively decided what 1 BTC is worth. You can't just decide what 10 satoshis are worth on your own. The value is prescribed by the community of people dealing in them.
Now if you own 10 *particular* satoshis and tell the world that they each represent a 1/10 ownership of a company you started, then you've probably changed the value of those *particular* satoshis. But that has no effect on the Bitcoin holding of everyone else. In fact it would probably be reasonable to stop calling those things Bitcoin and start calling them "dpStocks" or whatnot.
Likewise, a dealer could make 1 *particular* satoshi the deed (and key) to a car. Likewise the value of that satoshi has changed drastically.
Note: When I say *particular* satoshi, I mean a satoshi that has been "colored" or "stamped" a particular way.

I think its programability is very intertwined  in its nature.
You only own a bitcoin because you hold the key that changes the way that coin is locked.
When you "received" the Bitcoin, somebody else locked it for you with a lock that YOU had the key to.
That "lock" is just a script. It unlocks if you can make the script return "TRUE". So we can do all kinds of things with that script.  
Currently the script usually says "give me a private key that matches this public key". This is the traditional way of thinking about Bitcoin.  Another popular application is a "locking" script that will unlock for M of N keys. But the sky's the limit as far as I'm concerned. You can think up any script you want. Furthermore, if you own the keys to unlock any Bitcoin, *you* can lock them with your new script.
In this way, the Bitcoin is programmable.
Note: the script language is not Turing complete, so that limits us in some ways. I think this was designed with security in mind.

I've been thinking this since the day I read the whitepaper.  It was only when it struck me that "miners" really should be called "accountants" or "bookkeepers" or even "security guards" that I finally felt like I understood the system.
The term "miner" derives from the role these people play in "creating" the currency.  But this is incidental, they have a much more important, unrelated role: to expend time and resources such that no saboteur can take control of the network.  Satoshi had the idea of compensating them with the very currency they were supporting, but this certainly isn't inevitable.
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:42:04
We have a fixed supply currency.  So as long as demand increases (with population, economic growth), Bitcoin is a deflationary system.
Now I have a deep mistrust in our current centralized system.  My current response to Krugman is, "fixed supply currency is sort of the default.  If you want a supply that can fluctuate, then *someone* will have to control the keys to the castle.  As a result, you've centralized the system and with that comes all of our current problems. *You* should be making the argument for why we should give the keys to any centralized authority at all."
But Krugman still outlines valid issues that come with deflation.  Do we have solutions?  Is he blowing smoke?  Is his logic misplaced?  How do you all answer these?
**tldr the article;**
(1) People become less willing to spend. (Sitting on money becomes a decent investment.)
(2) Those in debt get in serious trouble awfully quickly, therefore they spend less.  Creditors have been shown to not spend more enough to make up for this difference (thanks u/Dubitator). (Flip side of (1), money owed appreciates in value.)
(3) Psychologically, people hate nominal wage decreases. (Year after year, employers will lower wages in name.  Even if the value of your wage rises, the amount written on the paycheck is lower.  That freaks people out.)

@_date: 2014-09-30 14:56:13


Okay, I'm still trying to figure this out.  And that's not quite what I was referring to.  u/benjamindees suggested that, because the supply of the currency is growing, say 10% in a given year, then there would be no deflation.  He's right, but only if there is constant demand.  If there is a 12% increase in demand that year, (due to population increase, consumer adoption, economic growth, etc.) then wouldn't there still be -2% inflation, or *deflation*.

Thanks for the response! Appreciate the info, but looking at their app, that workaround is specifically what I'm trying to avoid.  I can already sign into Safari and send from blockchain.info, so bitWallet doesn't quite help me there.
I want to be able to send directly from an app, and I'm willing to sacrifice security for ease of use in small amounts (like carrying cash in my wallet).

So you're thinking of work as "good 'ol hard work that makes you sweat".  But that's not the way I mean it or the way we should be thinking about it.
Work is producing something of value. Farming is being productive, fishing is being productive. Writing this article was productive! (Someone tipped me for it so I can actually begin to estimate a value.) You could find a weird looking leaf on the ground and sell it for a million bucks and *that* is productive. When you're creating value for someone somewhere, you're being productive. How do you know? Because somebody paid for it!
There are no "free" inputs to the system because *all* the inputs to the system are productive.
You still have not addressed this- *everyone* cannot consume more than they produce.

This is not true.  Blockchain technology is for "trustless network" with "no authority".  This can be used in many ways other than a "currency with no backer".  In fact, any part can "issue" it's own currency (see: [Colored Coins](
The United States Government could issue a coin colored "USBACKED" and would back it using the same system they use now.  (Obviously a shitty system, but people already buy it.)

Yes, that day of reckoning does come!  You die.  At some point, you have to stop working and producing.  If you're in debt when you die, you fucked someone over a little.  You sustained yourself off of their productivity.  I'm not passing moral judgement here, like I said that situation can be perfectly reasonable in a lot of cases.
But what I'm trying to stress is: not everyone can do that.  If I'm borrowing something, there needs to be some capital out there to borrow.  You can't borrow from nothing.  Somewhere, someone had to work to make something of value before you borrowed it.  In order to pay this off, you too must produce something of value.  If you don't, you will have consumed more than you produced.  Which is fine on a local level. But it can't be an economy-wide strategy. Put simply:  It's not possible for everyone to consume more than they produce.

Insert several snide comments contrasting "intelligent" and "regulation".  I can't speak for Reddit so I will speak for myself (that's how it works around here).  Regulation is inevitable if Bitcoin goes mainstream.  I don't particularly relish that thought, but the world we live in is not cast in black and white. And while I admire those who crusade for perfection, those very anarcho-crusaders can become a hindrance to their own battle when they demand everything and settle never.  They are important.  They are the reason we are where we are today.  But a realist does not a crypto-anarchist make.
So *intelligent* regulation will be important to the growth of Bitcoin.  Consequently, *unintelligent* regulation will follow.  But I do not fear this in the long term.  Bitcoin is a fortress. It's a mathematical inevitability.  It's a cat outside of its bag with no hope of ever being stuffed back inside.
Just as the internet, while regulated, has upended the relationship between the oppressors and the oppressed, even a regulated Bitcoin will make leaps and bounds toward a more free world.
The better question is the nature of the regulation.  All I have to say is, good luck Gov. :)
**TL;DR *Intelligently* regulate Bitcoin.  It will vault the crypto-currency to new places.  And ultimately, we have nothing to fear, mathematics will prevail and freedom will reign.**


I'm not the authority on this issue but just google these:
*Coinbase new-hires.
*China ban rumors.
*Gox 200,000 found.


I want the professional world to know that this is not a fad.  It is not a speculative feeding frenzy.  It is an idea that will not die.  Bitcoin is a beautiful mathematical framework that takes care of one of humankind's ugliest necessities, the industry of commerce.

Which question are you asking:
Why is it hard for indebted individuals in a deflationary economy?
Let's say I borrow $100 dollars today.  If the dollar is deflating, the value of my loan will increase over time.  Maybe I use that money to buy a nice pair of shoes today.  In ten years, when I try to pay it back (because for some reason I held it that long), $100 dollars is 6 months worth of rent.
Why is it bad for people to be in debt in general?
It's not... really.  It just means that at that moment, you have consumed a little more than you've produced.  Which is fine on any given day.  And for some people, that's fine forever.  But it's not a sustainable long term strategy for everyone in the economy. That's an impossible proposition, you can't borrow from nothing, the capital must come from somewhere.  If the economy appears to be working that way, something is amiss.

I thought of this too.  This hurts only in the case that your physical phone is stolen.  If this happens, I'd call Circle and tell them to lock your account down ASAP, which I'm sure they'd do for you.
I also noticed that on the "Verification" page, it makes no mention of Authy or Google Authenticator.  It simply says, "Enter your verification code."   Now obviously anyone familiar with Circle will know where to find that on your phone.  But if it's just some dude who knicked your phone or found it on the street, chances are it'll take him a while to figure that one out, hopefully long enough so you can get that call into Circle.

My lightbulb glowed halfway through Satoshi's paper in January 2014.  (I constantly feel late to the game; I need to remind myself that if we're here we're miles out in front.)
Specifically, it happened when I realized that the miners were simply being paid *by the system* to maintain *the system itself*.  It was some sort of self-reflexive strange loop straight out of a [Douglas Hofstadter]( wet dream.  
I immediately wrote in the margin of the paper "he's found a beautiful mathematical framework to take the place of one of humankind's ugliest necessary industries"

**If you're looking to hodl long**
If you have a BTC ATM in your area:
* buy with cash at ATM, load onto paper wallets, and store in a fireproof lockbox somewhere safe.
Else, if you are a hacker and follow safe practices (ie. don't use Windows as a baseline):
* [download Armory](  Follow their instructions. This is somewhat of a complex process but its the safest while keeping your own keys.
Else, if you don't mind letting a company hold onto your private keys:
* set up a [Coinbase]( account.  You can purchase through them with a linked bank account or transfer in BTC you have from elsewhere.
**If you're looking to buy small mostly to spend**
* use Coinbase.  They run the POS for many websites anyway (Overstock, TigerDirect) so it integrates very tightly.
Bon Voyage!

Danny would not be the first person to crumble under the pressure and attention of a quick rise to (tech) stardom.  It's a sad story for the investors, for the employees, and for Danny.
But this should stand as a warning to those young entrepreneurs (myself included) who lack not ambition but experience.  It should come as no surprise that *the future of finance* will take founders with more than just cute smarts and tech skills; thick skin and a moral compass are necessary to navigate these waters.  It's too bad Danny couldn't make it.

This would be a great coup for Bitcoin!  Not totally unfathomable either.
His largest concern would be security.  At first, Bitcoin payments would only make up a small portion of revenue.  Therefore the value risk isn't very high, especially if he believes Bitcoin will stick around.  But the possibility of having it all stolen would put many business owners off.  That said, I think we will see leaps and bounds in Bitcoin security over the next year.

Looks to me like Purse.IO caters to a subset of users who want to spend their Bitcoin at Amazon, and a different subset that wants to purchase Bitcoin with a credit card.
The premise:
* User A has Bitcoin and wants Cosmos DVD Set from Amazon.
* Amazon has a Cosmos DVD Set and wants USD (from a credit card).
* User B has a Credit Card and wants Bitcoin.
Purse.IO makes that happen, if not through a slightly (but unavoidably) awkward process.  Great concept, but with a shelf-life- once Amazon starts accepting Bitcoin they're cooked.

Do you think there are legal repercussions for working on OpenBazaar? I mean you don't have to convince me that this is a free and good and extremely worthwhile project. But I live in the US and don't want to have to run away, and I'm cognizant of the fact that our government might not look favorably upon a true free market. I'm also aware of the fact that I don't have the skills to hide what I do on my computer from the NSA. If I'm testing and contributing to something like OpenBazaar am I putting myself at serious risk?

Quite true, if everyone agreed to use GPUs or CPUs, then the network would process just as quickly and as long as nobody cheated, it would be just as secure.  Which would be nice, because they'd use a lot less energy doing it.  Unfortunately people cheat all the time.
It *is* just dick sizing, but its not pointless.  If the point is to secure the network, you want the biggest dicks in the world working on it.  Thus far, it has created the first "authority-less consensus-former", an extremely useful tool to humans who like to agree upon information without the meddling authorities. Bitcoin is a weak attempt at a first use, and even *that* is growing stronger by the day.
I can only predict that you'll eat your words "It's entirely pointless." in a few years or so.

You're exactly right, and that's okay. In an inflationary currency, the incentive is toward spending *now*, whereas in a deflationary one, the incentive is toward spending *later*.  People will always spend now, but only on the want/need products, rather than the maybe-want-need-this-now-really-might-as-well-because-my-currency-is-losing-value products.

I agree with the sentiment of the post, but comparing the market cap of a company to the "market cap" of a currency is deceptive. They are measures of very different things. I would argue that the "market cap" of Bitcoin is an almost useless metric to watch.

Bravo... I've tested it out.  You're spot on, they couldn't have made it easier. 
I can't attest to the security of the app, it seems very basic, but they make it very easy to use, and I think I could get used to carrying around maybe $50-worth BTC in bitWallet, easy to send and receive, at least until Apple removes the pole from their ass and allows a more robust wallet app.

I still don't see how this is different from any altcoin.
The picture I have in my mind of Black's Sidechain idea is not so much a separate network with separate miners, but that of a subset of the larger network running more specifically programmed blocks.

Very good work man, hope this finally get's through to Coinbase.
EDIT: I think their resistance to fix this can shed some light on where they are trying to go as a company.  As a social payment network, they're looking to make it as easy as possible for users to connect.  *That's the point.*  If users are limited in their connection abilities the network effect- their most powerful driver of growth- suffers.
That said, this *must* be fixed, there's no way around that.  Furthermore, I don't think they have to sacrifice too much inter-user connectivity to put a few basic roadblocks up for phishers and spammers.

It is your job to advertise your own projects.  That's how lighthouse stays so lean.  But as Hearn says, project galleries will likely pop up and compete with each other.  Then you can use those galleries to advertise, and anyone else can visit those galleries to browse projects.
Lighthouse is by definition a decentralized tool.  If you had a single, necessary project gallery, you begin to rely on a third party and the model becomes centralized.

Blocks are actually a "difficult" thing to make, on purpose.  Miners are actually trying to make as many blocks as they can right now (that's what they're being rewarded to do) and they can only average about 1 new block per 10 minutes.
Why? What if we add more miners to make new blocks faster?
Right now written into the protocol is a "difficulty" adjustment. About once every two week the network looks at how fast blocks are being created- let's say enough new miners have been added to bring the time down to 1 new block every 9:45. The network offsets the progress and actually "rebalances". It increases the difficulty by a small amount specifically to maintain a rate of 1 block every 10 minutes.
Now to your point- that rule is somewhat arbitrary. Satoshi could've picked a new block every 5 minutes instead of 10. Or maybe even 2 minutes (I think litecoin does that?)
But much less than 2 minutes and you start running into problems. A faster block rate increases the likelihood that the chain splits (2 valid blocks are created within the time that it takes to communicate to all nodes around the world). And while the chain would always get back on track, at any given moment we'd find ourselves in a perpetual state of 2, maybe 3 valid chains until the next block was solved. This is a topic for another day.
But to round out- given that the block size is 1Mb, let's say we go with your solution- we just use more blocks. So we change the protocol to increase the block rate to once every 2 minutes instead of once every 10. Well we've really only bought ourselves 5 Mb per 10 minutes (instead of 1Mb/10min) and we're already approaching the limit on what we can do with that solution.
Not a bad solution, but what I'm trying to get at is we can't just make a shitload of new blocks to increase space for transactions. Blocks by their nature should be spaced out and incremental such that there is no question which one came first.

No that *is* the point. It's the only point to be made in response to a post like this. The *value* of 1 dollar matters little over three generations. It is much more interesting to look at the value of the dollar with respect to costs and wages and everything else in any given time frame.

You have the right sentiment, but there were a few face palms in your post too. 
Decreasing inflation is not deflation- *negative* inflation is deflation- but this doesn't show that. This chart shows inflation. A deflationary chart would have a positive slope whereas this slope is negative.
Of course we are better off than we were during the Great Depression, vorhees isn't arguing that. But a dollar cannot buy you as much today as it could then. Empirically. Now this is not necessarily a bad thing. Stretched over generations, small inflation makes little difference, so for those arguing that this illustrates an essential flaw in our monetary system, they're wrong. But you're right- it does not mean the standard of living has gone down.
