LOL police might make it in time to take a report or call the coroner. The only crime they typically catch "in action" is somebody exceeding the speed limit, everything else is after the fact.

Certainly a creative idea, thanks.

I'm sure you are right, but I'm admittedly paranoid. In Venezuela the government confiscated contents of citizens safe deposit boxes. That is FAR less likely in the US but if the USD is challenged by BTC (at some point in the future) THEY WILL declare BTC illegal and use that as justification to access safe deposit boxes or any other private property to "confiscate" the illegal BTC from anyone known to have who converted fiat to BTC on a regulated exchange.

Can't sell BCH, s that true? That would be helpful to my sanity if it is true...

If you moved your coins out of coinbase they treat that as a SALE for 1099 purposes. If you did any trading through GDAX that will also factor into it. Just pay the taxes based on the 1099 you will get from coinbase, end of story. Otherwise you could spend a whole lot more in legal fees.

I don't have a fortune in BTC, but it is a lot of money for me. 
Tone Vays says that 75% of all crypto exchanges that have ever existed have been hacked. Even though coinbase is clearly solid, never say never. 
I like the dual encrypted USB idea, thank you. To up the paranoia a bit, I will assume the USB in my house was found, copied and replaced giving the thief plenty of time to brute force it. So on my return I will be sweeping my coins to a new wallet regardless.

If you want to sell BTC when it falls to a lower price then you will issue a STOP order at that lower price. The order will remain active until it executes or you cancel it.

Are you saying that if I resend to the same address with a higher fee, the transaction with the lower fee will never be confirmed? It seems that it should be treated as just another transaction? For example if I am sending $1.52 at my local gas station to buy a soda, then realize my wife wants one so I do the same thing again. I've heard of people replace transactions with more suitable fees but do not understand how it is done...
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:00:58
If every txn goes to every node that would imply one common mempool and not a unique mempool for every node... Right?
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:50:30
So when I send a transaction what determines whose mempool it goes to? Seems like I would get lower fees and faster confirmations in the smaller mempool...

Lack of denial is not credibility for the accuser... only corroboration can lend credibility. Innocent until proven guilty is what I and the constitution say...

I don't question anything you've said here but when I send the same amount from coinbase the fee is just over $2 versus $12 when sending from my bitpay wallet. In my mind this is clearly bad acting by bitpay. It's only a small amount of mining revenue in my bitpay wallet so I will just take the hit, but never again.
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:12:41
That is something I did not know, bitpay was my mining wallet so lots of small deposits. Perhaps I unjustly crucified them... thanks for the education :-)

Been following Tone Vays for a while but he doesn't make his TD Setup &amp; Countdown script available to his followers as far as I can tell and he never answered my email requests. So after a little research on Tom Demark's time-based analysis (which Tone uses) I've been able to rewrite the script for the tradeview pine editor. If anyone is interested in obtaining the script just send me a private message.

The problem with that is I am not sending $1 Billion. Any type of mass adoption will include/require cheap micro-payments and that does not appear to be happening, even with segwit transactions.

When I started I was using paper wallets, but they are cumbersome and it got old very fast. I did not want to spend a lot of $$$ on a hardware wallet but I did spent a little on a dedicated android phone ($59 Amazon) and I installed the Coinomi wallet. I only use the phone for cryptos (no sim card) and when I am not sending/receiving coins the phone is turned off which is 99.9% of the time.

Sorry, debunked was the wrong term. It was the narrow context in which you were desperate for confirmation. You are correct, but you can't see the forest for the trees.

BTC is capped at 21M (deflationary), USD is not capped (inflationary). I can't check your numbers but they could be right at them moment. Do you deny that at the next halving the picture will change?
