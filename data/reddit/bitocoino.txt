What th'! That's all complaints, LOL! OK, not ALL, but mostly...
Still, I use their wallet, and it works just fine for me. Although I never keep that much in mine. Because I HAVE seen the multitude of problems that others seem to encounter. Maybe I'm just lucky? Hardly seems likely, since the price seems to drop every time right after I buy.

I agree with this, unfortunately. "... and they have a plan." "They" being the U.S. gov't. This bodes ill, damnit. What better way to derail the bitcoin train. The value of bitcoin is peanuts to such players, but the damage it could cause to their conventional banking scam is immense. ERgo...

To all those who worry that the word "bit" already has many meanings, I say fie on thee! English, and many other languages abound in homonyms, and we rarely get confused by them. 
When someone says that the Goths sacked Rome, do you think they placed the whole city into a paper bag?
If I told you I was in a jam, would you be wondering whether it was strawberry or blueberry?
If you hit someone with a club, it's probably not a debating club or a judo club (or a judo "chop"!)
If we adopt "bits" as the default day to day unit of the currency, we WILL get used to it...
After all, if I have to pay someone 5 bucks, I am not giving them 5 male deer, am I?

Anyone know where the 5th one is?

Yep. Couldn't agree more. Posted a similar topic about a month ago, and got downvoted to zero points. I thought this topic always goes down, so congrats!
The TechnoElitePurists want to do the metric prefix thing. Joe Blow III uses it in school, but won't want that in real life (too geeky), and so, good luck persuading him to pay .000005 BTC for that Starbug Latte. Or is it .0000005 BTC? .00005 BTC? Yeah, that's just poor ergonomics. We change that, or we die. Joe Blow III, meanwhile, is just fine with that fiver - five bucks, not usually confused with 5 male deer.
"Bits" are friendly. It's not as if bits haven't been used before as money, so it's not an alien concept. Friendlier than nano this, pico that, and micro the other thing.

Right. But if a coffee is really 5.25 bits, then 5.25 btc will be worth 5.25 million dollars, a fairly excessive amount to keep in an iphone wallet. Still, your point is valid. But I would argue that he is less likely to be confused by 5.25 bits, than by .00000525 btc. So easy to get the number of zeroes wrong. Even when you're not drunk.
Perhaps wallet software needs to have a "Are you sure?" button.

I don't know where you live, but if you're close to a Lamassu atm you could try that, though the fees may be sort of heavy. IIRC 5% or so. There's no scanner for palms or fingerprints, but some jurisdictions require you to show some sort of ID, and they do keep records. Sorry, I don't have any specifics on this.

I like the Dogecoin community, and feel that we Bitcoiners could do well to adopt some of their fun spirit. But as an investment, I have little faith in any altcoins, although of them, Dogecoin has that "Spark" which may cause it to be adopted widely. However, unlike Bitcoin, which is capped at 21 million forever, Dogecoin will keep expanding forever, much like the universe! Not a recipe for increasing value, obviously. But it's fun to tip. Have some!

Vancouver, so it's not like I can't find an ATM! However, apparently some of them have gone non-anonymous recently. 
Interesting how the evolution has gone from huge (Robocoin) expensive machines, to smaller (Lamassu, Skyhook) reasonably priced machines, and from there to a logical endpoint, one of which is your service. From a business owner's perspective,  they no longer have to worry about someone opening an ATM close by, as, so what? It's just extra revenue for them, with no major outlay required.

Oops, I'm not used to this bit-tipping mechanism. Thanks for the bit-tip. It actually took me a while to realize that I had been tipped twice. I originally thought that it was just some sort of delayed confirmation notice.

Seems like your service could be viable in Canada. $300 is also a sweet spot, as putting more than that into an ATM just feels, somehow, WRONG, especially with the 3 - 5% fees.

What if AMD or Intel started making motherboards with built in ASIC mining capability? Pretty sure that Satoshi intended that everyone be able to mine some. How does that correlate to today's situation?
Even better: if the Bitcoin protocol became either Scrypt friendly or hybrid Proof of Work/Stake. 
Too bad I can't see any of these states changing.
So how about if people just started spending their coins instead of hoarding them? Don't really see that happening either...

Thank you for the ominous information. Fortunately, 2,3,4 and 6 are (I think) Lamassu machines, and have no provisions for KYC intrusions. However, you can only buy Bitcoins, and not sell them.

4. Bitcoin can be sent by anyone, to anyone, nearly instantly, for pennies, with the click of a mouse.
5. Bitcoin can be hidden. The nice people at the border may see a suitcase bulging with US dollars, but if you can memorize 12 words, you can carry unlimited amounts in your brain.

When people use terms like "fool-proof", what they really mean is to make so that "dumb" errors are more easily prevented from happening. Because smart people do stupid things (driven lately?), because they are distracted, careless, or lack knowledge. Or their fingers slip/are cold/d.t. Whatever. 
Maybe we need to use military protocols. Anything to cut down on the possibility of mistakes. Applied ergonomics.
Sure, people CAN use SI prefixes. But maybe they don't WANT to, so why should they HAVE to. Why not avoid their use altogether?
After all, they don't NEED to use Bitcoin at all, do they? So if we want them to WANT to use it, maybe we need to step down from our scientifically correct high horse, and make it familiar to them.

It's not a dumb question. I used to buy from localbitcoins, but now just put money in one of my city's ATMs. Yeah, the rate sort of sucks, but it really does not matter.
Because if Bitcoin has a binary outcome then either it will be very valuable, or worthless. If it becomes worthless, then it won't matter what I paid for it. And if it succeeds, again it won't matter what I paid. Only if it lingers in the middle, doing nothing, will I be on edge. But that middle area is about as stable as a pencil balanced on its point. As long as I only put in money that I don't need, I will sleep easy.
Good luck. I hope you can find a way to get some. Although I am not sure there is a huge need to rush right now.

I'd love to try this, so thanks, Saffron!
Anyone: Is it possible to tell if this address is from a colored bitcoin wallet? It is, but is there any way to tell by looking at it?
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:57:55
You never really own a ~~Patek Philippe~~ Bitcoin. You merely look after it for the next generation.
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:48:15
The longer it takes us to adopt this change and use "bits", the less optimistic I am about Bitcoin itself succeeding. 
If it has to do with money, don't you think people will familiarize themselves with the nomenclature, at least enough to be able to suss out the meaning from context?
I've said it before, that most languages have many words that carry multiple meanings, and we manage to use them non-ambiguously, unless we are deliberately joking, that is. 
When you say you're going to ***pay*** someone 5 bucks, they rarely expect to receive 5 male deer.
@_date: 2014-07-11 18:29:05
Yesssss!...                                ...ehh.
OK, maybe there ARE some other obstacles. But why not fix what we can?
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:37:03
Also, what if you could go to a coffee shop and put in $10 towards a $5 coffee and get the change in bits? The merchant would not even have to exchange via BitPay, but would just pay from incoming BTC transactions, and so would save on transaction fees. Win-win! A way to hasten adoption, maybe?
@_date: 2014-06-23 03:48:32
Yes, please, to the "bits". This needs to happen, and soon. Thanks for bringing it up.
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:23:01
Popcorn now!
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:26:58
Thanks! I just discovered changetip this morning, and have already been tipped 3 times. It could be like some say: Bitcoin need not fear the Altcoins, because it will just adopt their better features. I used to think that was just whistling past the graveyard, but maybe there is something to that.
With the impending(?) changeover to bits and a more active tipping culture, who knows. But if Doge does not remain the predominant Tip Coin, what is its raison d'etre? (Note: I am very pro-Doge, despite my screen name). 
@_date: 2014-05-10 16:14:44
Good luck to both of you. I'd be scared to take either side of that bet, but side looks scariest to me (by a slight margin).
Still, buying now, at fire sale prices (I hope).
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:07:38
Much cleaner than the other mine, but like tnorthb, the room full of boxes for disposal makes me go, "Hmmmm..." Still, the other place looked like a disaster waiting to happen.
The evaporative cooling is smart, but though the air drawn in is cooled, is there some means of dehumidifying it too? Or is it not necessary, given the short time before the equipment becomes obsolete?

Vancouver, B.C.: Anonymous, Y or N?
1 - Waves, at Howe and Smithe, Y
2 - QuadrigaCX HQ, on Water St. in Gastown, Y
3 - Steamrollers on Robson, Y (Probably, since it's a Lamassu, and there didn't seem to anyone attending it when I passed by.)
4 - BCIT in Burnaby, ?
5 - 986 West Broadway and Oak (It is 24/7) ?
6 - "Decentral.bangtown", corner of Richards and West Pender Y (probably, since it's run by Quadriga CX)
Anyone? By now, I must be missing a few!
@_date: 2014-11-11 13:30:28
It would be nice if I could exchange some of the Doge I have been tipped into bits, which I could then tip. Since my Doge in the Dogetipbot and any bits which I received via changetip are off both blockchains, this needs to become a thing.
Otherwise, Doge, and not bits will become the internet tipping currency. Oh, wait...
OP, it's all good if if it gets them into the Bitcoin ecosystem, whether or not they are trolling for tips. A: we don't HAVE to tip them. B: check their post history. Make your own judgement.

I like this idea a lot. Distribution of the network via incentives to run full nodes also give present day mining conglomerates a reason to shut down their machines whilst still earning without further global warming.
The inability of the small guy to mine and help maintain the network has always been a yellow light for me. Thanks for showing a way to turn that light "Green"!

Big and small at the same time: the adoption of 'bits' as the default unit. Leading to a massive take-up by non-technical users. Hoping.
@_date: 2014-11-11 17:33:31
Like this idea! I'd like to keep some DOge in the bot (I use it as a faucet wallet), so how about 12,000 doge? 
I'll start: 
+2000 doge

You don't mean that the address would have the price built into it as part of the address itself, do you? Like send 45 bits to:183minisexfinger45bitsimsowetS8stWBaXeVDK5JbQG LOL?
Although, I am for anything which reduces the chances of committing an error. Even if we DON'T adopt 'bits', we should still work on this.

The PM Streaming companies (Franco Nevada, Royal Gold etc) must be looking into the future with some fear. I wonder what THEIR projected timelines are?
But it sure is good to see that someone has the will to make this finally happen.

Excellent! OP, spend 15 minutes watching this. It's a very good investment of time. The fact that you can memorize the seed, and remove all traces of anything Bitcoin related from your computer device and recover your BTC from anywhere is killer.
@_date: 2015-07-20 07:11:41
[EmDrive!]( or something makes this inevitable. But not, perhaps, imminent.
@_date: 2015-07-12 19:13:13
Yup, good points. Memorize it AND back it up.
@_date: 2015-07-19 04:09:31
That's always sort of bugged me. I do not want Bitcoin's value to increase until they (government agencies) no longer hold any. Once the US Marshals have sold, then, to the Moon!

Shapeshift is great, but their limits are quite low, iirc, about 4 btc worth of crypto at a time. Now if you had $48K worth of Monero, you COULD send it under the radar, and he could transform it via Shapeshift, at his leisure into btc. But even with Monero, you would, I think, be wise to split up the transaction into smaller amounts.
Since you are in Canada, if you are near a major city, you could use a BTM. Some have the KYC hard/software turned off, and some of them even have reasonably low fees. But you'd probably have to keep the transactions below a threshold, around $3K per day. In Vancouver? [vancouver_bc_anonymous_atms_y_or_n_also_fees]( ) At least one of these ATMs has lower fees than localbitcoins vendors. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 02:44:15
That was an inspired perception. Thank you!
