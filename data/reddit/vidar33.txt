"We have a responsibility towards our citizens to explain and reduce the risks," said his German counterpart Peter Altmaier at a joint news conference in Paris.
At the same time, you can buy scratchcards and other 'games' in Germany at every streetcorner. No one seems to be concerned about the 'responsibility towards ... citizens'. Oh, wait: on these games there are taxes to be paid. Of course! :-)

This was back in 2013. Stone age, as far as cryptocurrency is concerned.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:39:12
I hear you!
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:56:20
I got a better idea: drop BTC and get BCH!
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:11:32
my guess: somewhere between -50% up to 150%
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:16:08
Money is money. With small investments, you can gain small(er) profits. The upside: if you lose, it probably won't hurt that much. Take it easy. And good luck!
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:45:56
No, you didn't. It's all about emotions now. That will pass. No worries.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:07:21
Perhaps the question should be: how can an exchange suffer so many outages in such a short time?
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:05:52
I am not quite 50 (almost) and I got into Bitcoin only about a month ago. Perhaps he needs to read a bit more about it first. :-)

I think it's perfectly fine to gather some advice and opinions, here at Reddit as well. First: talk to your parents about it. As you still live with them, you would like to have their support in case something goes wrong. Perhaps they would like to check out Bitcoin as well?
If I were you, I'd take it easy. Perhaps invest 100 USD. And see what happens. But that is only my honest opinion.
Last but not least: go and google on Bitcoin and find answers to your questions. After that, make a plan. But again: take it easy. Don't get overwhelmed by the so-called fear of missing out (in slang 'FOMO'). Bitcoin is here to stay. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:46:36
By now you should be fine again. :-)
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:03:19
should not have sold it. Next time: but it and keep it. HODL is the word!
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:07:41
first question: where is 'here'?
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:18:19
Anybody knows in which city this video has been taped?

It's just a sad response from Kraken.  Very sad.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:52:56
I know that now. Hopefully it is not too late.
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:28:40
Call me.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:47:18
Almost on a daily basis. ��
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:54:33
An eternity in this day and age. :-)
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:30:00
LOL! It's funny because it's true. :-)
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:53:50
Have you ever been to the filmfestival Cinema Ritrovato in Bologna, Italy? All about silent movies!
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:25:04
First you say that you have done a few transactions.  Later you say that you haven't. A bit confusing! ��
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:11:48
Can't you go to Bitstamp?
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:33:28
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:20:34
It's getting better.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:14:19
Oh yes! I am out of there!
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:06:17
Check out BCH. Still lots of potential.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:54:32
Leave Kraken. The rest wil take care of itself.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:54:54
'Then suddenly 3 orders are duplicated'
If you get a red line, but without any text, after you sent the order, the order will be executed. You will not see it on the 'new &amp; open orders'. It will appear directly on the 'closed orders'. It may take a few seconds. Perhaps this info can prevent you from duplicate orders.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:14:52
Same here. I tried to get verified by Poloniex. Didn't even get a response.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:05:26
'What is BCH?' I mean, really?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:17:05
True! ������
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:25:57
LOL!!! :-) Kraken may have its issues. But they managed to get back on top. To OP: did you try to log on from another computer? Did you activate 2-factor authentification? Have you sent a tweet to Kraken support on Twitter? I have hard time believing they will not sort this out. Keeps us posted, please!
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:48:16
Did you send them a mail to ask why? With Kraken I haven't had any withdrawal problems so far  (in Euro that is).
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:20:29
Perhaps you can spend about 20% of the total sum that you would like to invest now. And buy another 20% some time later this week. And so on. In that case you will get a nice average.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:02:17
to be perfectly honest, Kraken is one of the best. Don't take it from me, look at their records. I also have an account with Bitstamp. But I must say, that Kraken is faster, especially when it comes to withdrawals. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:00:53
Definitely not. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 10:23:21
So all we got to do is HODL! :-) 
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:49:08
How many lives does a cat have again? ;-)
