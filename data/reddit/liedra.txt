Eep, I just bought £50 from there too. Hopefully it's just a website issue and not anything else!!

Oh! Looks like the domain was hijacked. Here is some discussion on workarounds to get back to the domain:

Thanks very much! I definitely will :) 
The conference is the IFIP Summer School (it's not really a summer school though, more a conference!) and the workshop I'm involved in is this one: "Workshop IX: Social Implications for Privacy for Life" (though annoyingly it seems my name isn't on that one, but I'm in the "et al"! heh :) I'm down for my other talk on an unrelated topic though. 
As you can see it's in a week and a half's time, so I won't be able to do a full analysis of the data by then, but I do plan to do a proper analysis for the final paper I submit to the journal they produce which I'll get another couple of months to do after the end. 
Thanks for the suggestions - I'll have to do that next time though due to time for now (I've also decided that next time I definitely need some data about where people are from despite my original decision to leave that out - some of the very similar, strong responses I've been getting would be interesting to map to a place in the world). Anyway, as far as it goes for an initial study I think it's gone pretty well so far :)

She, and yes. It will :)

If you didn't notice, I wrote most the other comments showing how to do it :P

No, it's got to do with moving a .co.uk address - they don't work the same way as .coms and provide opportunities for hijacking. There's a lot of discussion in the links provided up above.

no worries ;) cheers for the effort! 
@_date: 2011-06-11 15:51:28
And we could store them in these!

This is correct! There was a study done on ethics professors and they were more likely to take sweets without doing the task required for the sweet (  ). Good thing I'm not a professor ;)
@_date: 2011-08-24 14:25:14
Yeah, I probably will - just thought I'd include an email option for those interested in being contacted directly (also I'm going through a couple of other places :)
Thanks for filling it out!

Not the most well known for its research, but there's a small but highly regarded tech ethics group that works in the Engineering &amp; Information Sciences school.

I just wanted to say I love your site. You make cool stuff! I wish you the best of luck with the BTC integration. :)

I won't tell anyone, I promise! I value my integrity and career in this industry :)

Ugh, this sucks. Worst thing is I don't think I can cancel my payment (even though it's still in the transfer limbo) due to bank policies :(
