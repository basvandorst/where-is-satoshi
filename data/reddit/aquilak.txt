My brother keeps telling me I could invest most of my money and make 1k a month with very low risk.  What kind of things should I be checking out in that subreddit?
@_date: 2016-04-23 19:19:36
Probably not retirement, meant 5 figures when converted :(  I wish I was smart because I first saw bitcoin when it was $0.25 a coin.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:45:44
Way to be a dick
@_date: 2016-04-23 19:54:51
Dumbass 16 year old me was like, how the hell does virtual money ever become worth shit?  There's nothing real to back it up.
@_date: 2016-04-22 15:57:31
Currently trusting them with a sizable amount and have been over the past 3 years.  Not sure what to think.
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:13:21


@_date: 2016-04-22 16:05:07
Guessing I should start withdrawing it bi-monthly then...  Would suck to lose 5 digits to an account freeze.
@_date: 2016-04-22 16:36:07
Haha, already have 5 figures of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:56:24
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:32:27
Seems fine to me.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:33:17
It won't help.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:06:26
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:57:24
Ha, sucks to bee youuuu!
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:59:50
Your account would tell me that this is probably a big lie.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:23:52
I had to check which sub I was reading... Wow 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:49:14
I love seeing how many salty fucks are leaving because of this :D
@_date: 2018-09-25 19:28:05
Strange how your account was almost never used before today...
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:21:48
Hard to bank the unbanked when it costs so much to send any amount.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:36:42
Just look at the market caps of these coins...
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:59:32
Nodes don't mean shit.
@_date: 2018-09-25 20:17:02
Go back to lurking then.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:45:34
Mmm, false information is tasty.
@_date: 2018-09-25 21:14:21
I think he might be a bit slow...  I don't know though.  I saw large wall of text and I looked at the account post history and saw nothing for a long time.  I didn't even get past a few lines of his text either.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:30:04
Something seems off here...
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:32:22
Guess that explains why they’re still using bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-25 21:13:03
Wasn't trying to be hostile, was just pointing it out.
@_date: 2015-12-30 20:33:04
I think that changes from place to place.  Although being able to sell to one would be very nice, it's just rare.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:08:34
There's what I was looking to see.
@_date: 2018-05-21 08:04:09
Sounds like that guy was pretty clear in what he said
@_date: 2018-08-19 00:07:34
Totally weird, it’s like big business know
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:28:29
Already exists.
@_date: 2017-02-13 00:01:33
It actually means nothing, you can't compare the two statistics.  I don't know why one idiot did that and now other idiots are upvoting the initial idiot.
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:40:51
Ironic how you posted here
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:04:05
Core won't do anything to increase the blocksize that doesn't bring profit to them.
@_date: 2017-02-25 22:14:14
Probably because one side is smarter than the others...
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:55:05
Thats the whole point, there’s no one over there shoving core down your throat like it’s a magic pill
@_date: 2017-02-12 23:59:17
So let me just set it up so I do a commit every time I modify a line of code.  It will look like I'm active and know what I'm doing but I'll only just be an idiot typing away at the keyboard not even sure if I'm putting errors out into the commits.
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:11:42
Why only increase it to 1.8mb?  Waste of time.
@_date: 2017-02-03 10:29:28
he's right he's trying to convince users.
@_date: 2017-02-24 23:30:08
Not sick of it because unlike in the other sub this one has such a low intelligence that it gets upvoted
@_date: 2017-02-03 12:23:11
Thanks for the advice, I feel like it will greatly improve how I feel day to day!
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:40:04
The hell would reporting a valid ad do?
@_date: 2017-02-03 10:28:48
I just looked at a bunch of bullshit.
@_date: 2016-03-20 09:34:14
Article basically said nothing. How did this expanded sentence get on any site?
@_date: 2017-02-12 23:59:58
If only there weren't so many people that just like to blindly follow others...
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:52:33
So change your shitty pow and fail
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:17:30
Would be a waste to type more words for such a special person
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:10:11
Every time I come into this sub I feel there are more and more idiots that don’t learn anything. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:37:00
When nodes are mostly run by less than what must be no more than 500 people how the hell are you calling that the community? You’re nuts if you think that’s a community
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:11:42
I hope you lose your job to technology if you have that view.
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:21:34
At this current point.  Yep.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:48:55
It also said there would be a 2mb hard fork prior to segwit
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:21:54
Have fun with that
@_date: 2017-03-23 09:50:46
He can’t. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:06:07
Lemme know when your fee is $100.
@_date: 2017-03-24 01:14:10
I never actually thought about that... Now that I do it makes sense.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:48:15
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:55:27
Just hope you don’t get a bunch of double spends happening now.
@_date: 2019-03-14 12:55:22
Not worth it, something like this: 
It's basically pennies and they're charging $3000 for it.
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:25:42
You do know it’s a ton easier to run a node than a miner. Those nodes can easily belong to 20-30 people
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:33:00
No it wasn’t
@_date: 2019-03-14 06:53:05
Been trying to see if there was a reasonably priced spot/source to get a bunch of bills from...
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:21:03
Sure sounds like changing bitcoin means making it an alt coin.
@_date: 2017-03-23 18:20:46
If only nodes actually mattered for that argument
@_date: 2019-03-14 06:47:22
Seems pricey there.
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:11:00
I think he’s trying to blame them for his idiocy
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:13:54
Nodes don’t mean shit in the argument for supporting it
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:51:02
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:13:34
No because nodes are not how that shit works
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:16:40
... You replied to me and not the OP.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:18:32
Android only too :(.  iOS user sadly.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:17:05
Ew ripple :(
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:17:35
Shouldn’t it have chipped the bitcoin guy itself? I mean isn’t it a broken software on the coin itself? /s
@_date: 2018-10-01 01:19:20
Awesome, it's in someones kitchen. So it's not actually out there.
@_date: 2017-01-19 04:58:56
Hope it drops more.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:13:58
Don't have a way to get that.
Edit: looks like airbitz doesn't use a recovery seed thats words, just a hex string.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:03:20
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:20:19
Gee, if thats all you have to use to compare I can only imagine how dumb the left side is.
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:21:04
Yeah :(
@_date: 2017-01-19 04:58:09
because it’s not what was truly needed.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:03:59
You're not helpful and this is not what I was asking for.  
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:24:01
Wait... Yes to that I can't re-send a payment?  Would I be crafting a CPFP transaction or a double spend?
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:10:01
Used airbitz to generate the transaction.  I can get private keys from it.  How would I do CPFP assuming I have the private key?
Edit: I'm also a bit worried, because the transaction was a shapeshift payment.  I'm not sure how long shapeshift leaves their conversions open before I'd have to manually contact them to get a refund.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:35:50
Welp, guess I'm going to give it a shot.
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:52:52
segwit = giving money to company instead of miners.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:21:02
Makes good enough sense to me!
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:17:03
I mean btc.com wants $9 for my transaction...  At this point I'd pay them but they don't seem to accept payments outside China.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:10:07
Airbitz actually lets me send from the unconfirmed address, I was able to specify a fee rate that was nearly double what is recommended on the fee recommendation sites.  I believe this should work right?
Edit: It worked.
@_date: 2016-11-24 23:05:18
Don’t care
@_date: 2016-11-25 20:47:01
Because you’re not opposing their views
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:26:39
That accelerator still works?
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:44:50
Right because someone agreed to change the logo from the original...
@_date: 2016-11-25 23:00:56
Heard any bullshit about changing a 1 to a 2?
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:27:05
Because he’s told to say that and is too lazy to do his homework
@_date: 2016-11-25 00:32:54
I’ll just let the crazies destroy bitcoin then.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:15:59
Edited my comment, but I guess airbitz doesn't have word based seeds.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:14:24
Small pop!
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:20:34
So I insert my private keys into Electrum, wouldn't Electrum then detect that there is a unconfirmed payment and that I can't re-send a payment?
@_date: 2016-11-25 18:19:42
At least over there you’re less likely to see a post go missing.
@_date: 2016-11-24 23:42:22
Whats the next scaling in the future then? Fee market seems like a crazy idea.
@_date: 2019-08-03 19:32:23
But reddit is an echo chamber.  You always have to keep posting the old stuff that actually does not prove to be useful showing the progress of whatever topic the subreddit is about.
@_date: 2018-10-22 12:10:07
A vending machine in someones kitchen. Great progress.
@_date: 2019-08-05 07:38:23
You cute.
@_date: 2019-08-03 19:34:13
Your personality is showing.
@_date: 2019-08-03 23:47:27
Small firecrackers to be more descriptive.
@_date: 2019-08-03 19:35:43
Hope he doesn't need that 2 euros during the next time bitcoin gets popular.
@_date: 2019-08-03 19:27:55
Love how people say he's a criminal yet they regret to mention what the charges were for...
@_date: 2019-08-04 01:09:25
Keep telling yourself whatever lets you sleep at night :)
@_date: 2019-08-03 20:43:36
Thank you :)
@_date: 2016-12-21 19:48:43
Very true, I can easily set up and run a full node and have thought about it many times.  It's always there as an idea when I get a place that I own instead of rent.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:27:46
I have a key for an output also.  I was not aware that viabtc's accelerator still worked too.  I'm going to give that a shot first.
@_date: 2016-12-21 18:02:59
I’d pass on that
@_date: 2016-12-22 06:38:48
Why even use their crap?
@_date: 2019-10-07 16:05:04
Where is this earn money concept?
@_date: 2016-11-25 01:20:13
I don’t party.
@_date: 2019-08-03 19:31:10
He's neither.
@_date: 2019-10-07 16:04:08
Sounds about right
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:21:50
Sure looks good.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:03:31
Though to be fair, the other guy was attempting to poke for responses like this at this point.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:23:43
I look to pick up some cheap bitcoin then :D
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:11:40
Don't worry Bitcoin is controlled by a few select developers today that all appear to be retarded and not interested in having any of the currency they're developing for.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:21:07
I'm waiting.
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:54:38
We got a winner here!
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:04:17
Hasn't been used for a while now.  There's only one place I see that name.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:05:23
I'd rather they have anger management classes than have to take classes on how to expand the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-04-21 06:15:39
You've been doing it wrong... Buy an item on OPSkins and sell it on the steam market and suddenly you've only paid for 80% of the value that you end up with on steam.
@_date: 2017-04-07 03:37:47
Awh yeah real cool, some random text put into an image and then a yellow transparent brush was painted over the image.  Kewl.
@_date: 2019-04-25 04:49:43
Should also warn newcomers that if bitcoin ever gets large you’ll never be able to hold your own bitcoin as it will cost $100+ to open a lightning channel
@_date: 2017-04-15 01:45:42
Looks like you're talking out your ass.
@_date: 2017-04-07 03:43:40
I think there's 12 items in there that aren't allowed to be discussed on here?
@_date: 2019-04-26 07:12:00
Because Bitcoin can’t handle it? /s
@_date: 2019-04-25 11:17:12
@_date: 2016-09-06 00:00:24
Airbitz is a nice mobile one.
@_date: 2019-01-04 06:57:20
I feel sorry for whoever thought of this image
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:25:03
News flash, less and less people are using it, that's why it's getting cheaper.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:23:35
I never said I was comparing to that.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:10:49
You're right, it's not a slowdown, it's a goodbye.
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:31:25
Should steer you away for not supporting improvements.
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:17:02
Nope, that’s going down too.
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:04:59
But the backlog
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:50:00
Please stop being a redditor for 2 days.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:23:14
Don't worry I'll buy crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:46:08
Beg to differ, go look at the transactions per day.
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:52:21
Did not know about this tip bot. I love it.
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:45:34
Sounds about right.  It at least doesn't have ass developers.
@_date: 2019-09-07 18:14:10
What would that solve?
@_date: 2016-10-03 10:33:55
They shouldn’t be expected.
@_date: 2016-10-27 02:44:50
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:42:11
That actually sounds like a lot less than what I'm thinking about putting into there.
@_date: 2016-10-14 08:39:57
how is this not removed already?! ;P
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:10:29
I don't have a basement in the condo I own.
@_date: 2017-05-30 02:38:45
He seems smarter than you already! I'm so proud.  Unless of course... He's a misspelled air force supporter.
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:14:14
This saddens me.
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:11:39
Doubt you'd be willing to PM me a ballpark estimate of coins you were leaving in there?
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:54:35
Hopefully this guy shows you how stupid the people on this sub are.
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:23:47
Sounds like an issue core can't solve
@_date: 2017-05-05 23:37:05
It appears someone is upset with their own life.
@_date: 2016-05-28 23:45:54
Ha, bitcoin rising, better start selling stock lower to get more bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-07-03 13:53:16
Anyone else set a goal number of bitcoins to have?
@_date: 2016-05-25 20:04:16
Nothing because I can't influence the decisions by Chinese corporations.
@_date: 2016-07-06 12:19:18
Anyone have an opinion on airbitz?
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:23:09
Haha, nice little stash you have there :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:15:41
Which state?  Can I get more info on that?
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:45:23
If only the guy that stole them stole all of them and gave em away...
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:35:22
That makes me feel better leaving bitcoin in there.
@_date: 2016-07-03 13:35:28
So he can buy low?
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:59:37
I hear a lot of bullshit spewing.
@_date: 2018-12-18 03:11:32
And unless you have a need to see transactions happening live and verify them you literally just wasted your time!
@_date: 2019-05-23 10:57:15
Nah, I want smaller blocks
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:10:54
Because bullshit
@_date: 2018-12-18 09:53:12
Well you posted with what seems to be the intention to show off a new node.  I'm just stating that I hope you actually have a use for it because more nodes does not translate to a stronger network.  If you have an actual use then that's great :)
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:57:23
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:45:28
Depending on when he did, either really well or really shitty.
@_date: 2016-07-03 15:47:26
You'd either be extremely rich, or bitcoin would be dead.
@_date: 2017-06-05 03:03:42
LOL right.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:38:14
They're just jelly that some people have made off really well from this "magic internet money"
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:29:38
Please lower block size. It’s too huge and it’s needed now before it’s too late.
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:45:47
seeing as how it was the second transaction on that block that included it. Some miner hand picked it to be confirmed.  Looks accelerated.
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:33:49
That's just sad...
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:28:13
Had a bunch at 11/byte go through. Best time to consolidate!
@_date: 2016-07-03 15:47:40
I like this number.
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:11:02
Hodl
