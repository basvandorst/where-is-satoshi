Yeah, Croesus made it rich after he got in on the ground floor with that newfangled 'money' thing, but then he made a bad bet after the oracle of Delphi told him that he would destroy a great Kingdom if he went to war with the Persians.
I think the moral of the story is not to become to arrogant or complacent just because you got lucky once. Or maybe it is simply not to go to war with Iran.

Like all good scams this one shows again how hard it is to cheat an honest man.
It doesn't matter too much how computer literate you are as long as you don't feel the need to open a wallet that was obviously not meant for you, you won't be at too much risk.

I think things like the heartbleed bug have shown that just because everyone can look at the source code does not mean there aren't any hidden surprises in it.
I am not saying that Linux isn't in some use cases the better choice or that open source might not be a preferably model, I just dislike generalizing sweeping statements about Open and closed software base on one example each that have nothing to do with the problem at hand.

Are you trolling or serious?
How exactly does it matter whether the OS is closed source or not when the issue is that somebody put a virus signature into the blockchain?
The only reason why people running Linux are less affected by this is that they mostly don't run virus scanners because Linux gets so few viruses. This is less a product of Linux being more secure (which it is) and more of it being more obscure (and thus have fewer viruses written for it).
@_date: 2014-05-16 12:29:56
Not obscure as in "wreathed in shadows", but obscure as in "fewer people are using it".

What users?
I wasn't aware that there were actually any places that you could pay for anything with doge in the real world.
It is not like any pizza place suddenly decided to drop bitcoin in favour of doge.
Any it also isn't like any asic miners suddenly switched from bitcoin to doge either.
There wasn't really anything lost as far as I can tell except maybe some sort of internet popularity contests.

It wasn't really well known.
At first the only people who even had heard of the Web were people who already were on the Internet. The Web is just one of many things that run on the Net and email and USENET and FTP etc where much bigger back then. To make matters worse the internet wasn't even the only way to go 'online' back then. You had bulletin boards that you could dial up to and Videotex systems like Minitel and BTX that served a lot of the functions later taken over by the web.
In the first half of the nineties the only ones who really had access to anyone of that were people at universities and a few rare hackers. Some people who had gotten to use email and FTP and other internet applications at university had gotten a taste for it and private ISPs started to offer the ability to dial up into the net.
Then came the sudden popularity and the September that never ended and the Net started to become accessed more and more from outside educational and research institutions.
However for the common home computer user the internet only really went mainstream in the second half of the 90s when common home computer OS started to support that whole networking thing in earnest.
By that time the Web was a well known and major part of the Internet.

Considering that it is currently and for the foreseeable future more profitable for most websites to allow google to index them than not, I don't see why anyone who actually wants to be found would try to make google pay to allow google users to find them.
The Spanish press (and to a lesser degree the german press) have experimented with an attempt to force google news to pay them to list them. It didn't work out to well for them.
Most websites with a soft paywall make exceptions for google because they want people to visit their website.
There is also the fact that google already has lots of computing infrastructure and would be in a much better position than most to start mining bitcoins themselves if they really needed lots of them for some reason.

You should perhaps keep in mind that the mag-strip  thing is obsolete and insecure and not really used all that much any more in many places.
In Europe for example all modern cards use chip (they still have the mag-strip as a fall back for old hardware or for travelling to third world countries or the US.) If you come from the US to Europe and try to pay with your VISA card in a shop that says it accepts VISA you will run into trouble (at least outside of some tourist areas where they carter to foreigners).
Retrofitting old mag-stripe hardware to work with bitcoins would be a bad idea since that hardware is rapidly becoming a thing of the past.

Google the "School of the Americas" or as they wold like to be know today the [Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation]( Their list of graduates is a comprehensive list of dictators, mass murders, terrorists and other ne'er-do-wells who kept the US safe from communism even if it involved overthrowing democratically elected governments, creating military dictatorships, massacring and disappearing dissidents and sending out death squads.
all paid for by the US government in US taxpayer dollars.

Actually in money supply terms M0 (the total of all physical USD coins and and bills in circulation) is only a fraction of the total money in existence. The Fed has stopped reporting on the M4 numbers so we don't actually know how many dollars there really are, but it is accurate to say that the vast majority of USD only exit as digitial information on some computer.
Similarly I had an account in Euro a few months before they started issuing the physical money to the general public.
Most currencies today are digital.

It is very hard to compare the computing power of these miners to regular all purpose computers, since they are only really good for one thing. You can't run a linpack benchmark on an ASIC chip and most supercomputers won't be very good or at least efficient at mining bit-coins since they are basically just lots and lost of regular CPUs and GPUs connected together.
It is really an apple and oranges kind of thing.

Using email for money transactions is about the worst thing you can do. It would be like taping bills to a postcard or something like that.
Email is inherently insecure.
Using a service that resolves human readable addresses like "Loki-L's Wallet" into something like 1HLA5zov3iU6q7FLJqSvMVaZbbz9wrP6XP would obviously be a security risk. You have to trust the people running the service not to be scam artist and you have to trust them to be competent enough to keep out hackers.
Maybe all these Namecoins that everyone has been mining can come in useful here as a way to safely and securely resolve a Name into a bitcoin address, but money is a powerful motivator and any defence will only be as strong as its weakest link. I would allow other to test such a service with their own money before I trusted mine to it.

In my experience a moron based economy should be fairly stable, there certainly are enough of them to go around.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:29:13
I guess that if BitCoins ever got to the point where that might be a problem, somebody would think up some rule that everyone could agree on that for example any address that hasn't seen any activity in 10 years would considered invalid or something.
A similar thing exist with banks and preventing compound interest accruing on dormant accounts. You can't for example simply put $100 into a compound bearing account and have yourself frozen in carbonite for a few centuries.

I don't think it is really relevant to the process of mining and using transferring themselves and they wouldn't use such a highlevel backdoor just to break the encryption on your wallet (which might be affected) and steal some bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:42:25
Despite all my enthusiasm for Bitcoin, it should perhaps be kept in mind that the price for the removal of these barrier in many ways an increase in risk.
Paying with Bitcoin is a lot easier, but a lot of the comfort comes hand in hand with the lack of certainty and security that comes from having no regulations or oversight.
Personally I think that sometimes it is worth it and sometimes a SEPA transfer might be the safer alternative.
Bitcoin has advantages but it is not just advantages.

Actually if you really wanted to be pedantic and look at the actual meanings of the words you are throwing around you could conclude that neither is really analog, but BTC are a lot closer to being analog than USD.
USD usually only come in fractions of at least a hundredth. Every transaction is a multiple of a single cent. This is clearly a digital value.
BTC on the other hand are at least in theory infinitely divisible. Of course in practice you would still store the actual values in a digital representation, but compared to the Dollar they are a lot closer to being at least pseudo-analog.
To get a real analog currency you would have to use gold, silver or perhaps salt as a currency. Technically you would still run into trouble if you go down to microscopic scales or single atoms, but for practical purposes this would be an analog currency.

Sure, but the new thing would need to be somehow better or have something that the old thing didn't.
What is Bitcoin missing right now, that a different currency might have and prompt everyone to switch?
The only thing I can think of right now is mainstream acceptance. If a bunch of big financial players decided to get into the whole crypto currency thing, but felt they needed to build their own, that could be it. If VISA and MasterCard got together and said they would officially support some new new Bitcoin clone with some added features they liked that could be it.
Another thing would be if some major flaw was found in Bitcoin or the blockchain got compromised or something, of course since most alternatives to Bitcoin copy the technology behind it quite closely, most current implementations would have the same flaws.
Unfortunately the only apparent advantage most current Bitcoin alternatives seem to have is that people think they can get rich easier with them.

The exchange rate will stabilize when people actually start using it instead of mostly speculating with it.
Every pizza bought with Bitcoin makes the whole thing more stable.
Bitcoin will either find that stability or it will be killed of by the speculators in the end. The level at which it will stabilize doesn't really matter except to those who are already heavily invested in Bitcoins right now.
It is not like  people look at the exchange rate between the Euro and the Yen and then simply decide that Yen is the worse currency because a single unit of it is worth less than a single unit of the other.

Here is a [quick and dirty chart](
It can be seen that the difficulty was actually fairly constant from summer 2011 to the beginning of 2013 (at least compared to the dramatic rise we have experience this year)
Extrapolating the development this year with nothing more than a straight line drawn in paint we might predict a rise by an order of magnitude every 4 month give or take a few weeks or 10 billion by around March/April

Yes, I think I managed to buy into the whole craze at the exact point when the price was the highest it ever was and apparently ever will be. Now it seems to be with half as much as it did then. It is a god thing I guess that I only 'invested' it a relatively small amount and mentally listed the money as good as gone the moment I paid it...

I don't think the idea behind that Thing is to save the planet, but to save your wallet from the power utilities.
It is to save energy costs associated with bitcoin mining.
Of course, at $900 and only power for 16 USB ports this won't actually be profitable.
The fact that it appears to be lacking the ability to store electricity during the day to keep running at night is just the icing on the cake.
Still the general idea is good, they just need to make it cheaper, provide more power and more ports and add a battery.

Don't let the recent history fool you. I got into Euro right at the beginning. Practically invested all my savings in the new currency the moment it was electronically available. Coins and paper money came later and the dollar was worth more than a single Euro.
I remember when Euro and Dollar reached parity (about 11 years ago) and everyone thought it was a big deal. A few years later a single Euro could get you up to 1.6 USD (I really should have invested in the Dollar back then.) A few month after its peak the Euro was only worth about 1.25 Dollar. The Euro has never really recovered from that peak also it came close a few times.
What I am basically saying is: be careful when investing in strage new currencies. You never know which way they will go.

Technically you become a country if other countries recognize you as one. The trick to being recognized as a country usually involves a combination of diplomacy, bribery, threat of force and realistic assessment of actual facts on the ground.
To get your small artificial island or floating city recognized as a country by international laws you would for example need to spend quite a lot of money to bribe various cheap third world nations to recognize you and hope it catches on or something like that.
In the end it all sort of comes down to force. If the US navy doesn't want you to be a sovereign nation, you would have a hard time arguing with them unless you happen to have bought some cheap ex-soviet nuclear arms as a deterrent.

If you look at [the list for EMV Implementation and liability shift on wikipedia]( things appear to be even worse.
Basically the shift is the credit card companies saying, that if a vendor doesn't implement the new technology and fraud occurs the vendor is liable not VISA or Master card, this is supposed to get the last people still operating the old legacy systems to upgrade to the new secure ones.
Africa started that shift in 2006 for both Visa and MasterCard and they are done now. It seems the country farthest behind is the US where tentative goals for 2015 or 2017 are still considered and few people think that the issuers and the infrastructure will be really be switched over by then, it will just be the businesses holding the buck if something goes wrong.

As I said, I was pedantic using a certain definition of digital and analog.
BTC is closer to an analog signal, because it can, because of its theoretically divisibility, taken on arbitrary values.
