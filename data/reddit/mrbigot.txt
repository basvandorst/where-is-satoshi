Being offended is a choice. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:16:55
Show me one example on this sub. How hard can it be? You are all so convinced this place is full of them. Just one. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 10:28:21
I cringed. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 11:59:51
That title. 
The least important and possibly irrelevant part of this article. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:00:53
Typical Bitcoiner in this sub:
"I don't agree with this guy so he must be a paid shill"
"He said Bitcoin won't be 10k by next month! Paid shill! Burn the troll!"
@_date: 2014-10-14 12:59:48
Right, and Bitcoin is the one and only solution. Impossible for something else to happen. 
And i studied history when you still were in your daddy's ballsack. How often did the dollar dissapear and something else took its place again?
@_date: 2014-10-17 19:46:50
This seriously has been asked and answered at least 200 times. 
Why do you people just refuse to use search? Can you explain that to me?
@_date: 2014-10-16 02:24:10
Uhm actually the Bitcoin community is one if the most gullible, easy to scam people i've seen in long time. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 02:19:27
Chances of what are pretty slim?
@_date: 2014-10-13 18:06:29
Why don't you explain it to us?
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:27:18
How did he "find" those coins?
@_date: 2014-10-14 06:26:54
Goodbye. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 22:22:14
How can all you people still not see this is a scam? Are you all new to the internet or what?
And we've had 100's of these posts here. Can you just stop posting it?
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:31:00
Is Mintpal working well? I missed all of this. I still have some money there. Can i take it out?
@_date: 2014-10-14 13:05:43
And of course you get downvoted to oblivion if you don't think that within 5 years Bitcoin will replace the dollar. 
This place really is something else...
Just imagine what non Bitcoiners will think when they come here for the first time. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 21:41:08
"Murder does seem to be big business on the Dark Web."
Is there even 1 confirmed murder case?
@_date: 2014-10-16 02:19:52
Source please. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 23:57:17
But no evidence still? Not even an example of who would be a paid shill? Eventhough i read those words here every single day?
@_date: 2014-10-12 23:16:57
The OP is obviously the person who typed that Pastebin. 
The fact that he thinks anyone will send him even a penny says a lot about his iq. Just some stupid kid.  
@_date: 2014-10-15 23:33:50
Will my coins on Mintpal be gone?
@_date: 2014-10-16 08:38:10
Use some common sense next time you ask a question and you won't get shitty answers. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 08:58:00
Wrong sub. This sub is about Bitcoin. 
And i never ever seen so much crying about (non existing) shills as in this sub. 
This place is filled with retarded paranoid kids. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 18:45:06
No. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:08:01
What does that mean?
Anyway, here we go again. How does this make Bitcoin a ponzi scheme? Are you ever gonna answer this?
Edit: i see you changed your topic title by adding Coinbase in front of it. 
So you figured out Bitcoin isn't a ponzi?
@_date: 2014-10-14 14:57:05
Spam. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 13:02:17
Oooh right. Because i don't support insane Bitcoin la la land theories i am a banker shill. 
You people really are beyond pathetic. 
@_date: 2014-10-12 23:31:39
If you even for 2 seconds thought this could be real then at least the stupid part is correct. And as this was your first post i still am quite sure this was done by you. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 18:04:11
I heard Robocoin is a good choice. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 20:24:17
No, you can't be serious. This has to be a troll. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 12:49:10
Huh? Who told you the dollar will collapse and Bitcoin will replace it?
@_date: 2014-10-16 20:33:35
So what part of your story makes Bitcoin a ponzi scheme exactly?
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:22:29
Actually you said it. In the title and in the comments. Stop lying. 
Nice personality you have. I bet you will get real far in life and tons of people like you. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 23:41:15
Can you give me one, just one example on this sub. Really, just 1 example of a paid shill. 
Bitcoiners love to throw those words around here. Paid shills. 
Not once have i seen any evidence of this. 
Are you the first person to show me? Somehow my guess is no. 
Edit: Lots of downvotes and not one example. Didn't see that coming. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:42:41
So what are these ramifications on Bitcoin exactly? I fail to see them. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:18:34
Uh no, that's not how it works, retard boy. You accuse me of being a paid shill. How about you present us the evidence of this claim?
I have absolutely nothing to proof to you. 
If you'd actually read my history you'd see i'm a bitcoin supporter. 
But that's probably too much for you. 
"I don't like him so he must be a paid shill". 
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:15:26
I see you took the time to read about it in one of the 100's of online sources. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 21:05:12
Stop making a fool of yourself. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 19:19:31
Wrong sub. 
Try for example. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 17:33:51
Wrong sub. Please check the rules on your right. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:40:08
A guy who uses 2 nicks who posted that Bitcoin is a ponzi and lies in about every comment he makes calls me a troll? Seriously?
@_date: 2014-10-14 06:27:48
That volume is not real. In reality it's way less. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 11:07:27
@_date: 2014-10-16 01:55:45
Stop making shit up. It could be at 10 dollars from now on. Nobody knows. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 10:37:13
No it isn't. It's fake volume. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 18:22:05
Riiight. Ok. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 13:11:17
I own more bitcoins than you ever will, you fucking dumbass kid. But unlike you i don't live in Bitcoin fantasy land. 
Since that moron Kitthecar stopped his obsession you took his place as the biggest, dumbest Bitcoin cultist on this forum. All based on the fact that you hope your 0.3 coin will make you a millionaire. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 01:57:31
And a pretty good chance it will be worth shit. You forgot to add that part. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:24:45
Sure. Now let's get to the point. One example of a paid troll here please. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 20:55:19
2 people in this sub trying to start a circle jerk you mean?
@_date: 2014-10-14 17:43:47
Hardly anything to do with Bitcoin. But whatever to get the circle jerk going. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 11:52:41
"first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win!! "
Ever noticed it's always clueless idiots who post these kinda things?
After reading that i just knew bullshit would follow. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 22:46:04
He's 12 million richer as i am. I call that smart. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 21:58:38
You just posted this with another username. And you were asked how this makes Bitcoin a ponzi, which you couldn't answer. 
Why post this shit again? 
@_date: 2014-10-17 08:10:06
Here is a guide. Avoid people using the word biz. In their domain name specifically. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 13:13:51
How old are you? You sound like the typical 16 year old stoner kid who owns 1 coin. The kind this place is filled with. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 21:23:34
A few million? Uh no. Way more. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 13:19:12
Downvoted why exactly?
@_date: 2014-10-15 22:11:03
No. Use some common sense. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 13:25:01
The stock market is so much bigger. We would notice it if these people started buying Bitcoin instead. And i'm not talking about a 50 dollar price rise. 
It always amazes me how extremely little common sense many Bitcoiners have about the financial markets. Every day i just read the most crazy theories here. You don't even need to understand the financial world for that. Just common sense. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 13:43:50
That's what you get for dealing with sites that use .biz
@_date: 2014-10-13 19:58:14
And oranges are orange. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 20:53:20
Yes. This place is full of them. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 21:09:10
How is Bitcoin a ponzi scheme of this. Just answer that. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:07:43
Can a mod ban the url already. It's clear this guy will keep spamming this scam. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 02:28:26
I was thinking the same thing. 
Also kinda hilarious how all these kids here think everyone will move to Bitcoin. Based on absolutely nothing. 
One look at the chart this year and it's safe to assume very few people will put their money in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 12:52:01
Can you believe there are actually believing this. 
As in 5 years from now the dollar will collapse and everyone will move to Bitcoin and that's it. 
What must go on in your head if you think life works this way. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 11:31:55
"But investors holding this high-tech currency could be playing with “dirty money.”
You see, since the currency is completely untraceable, you never know who you’re selling it to, or buying it from."
How many more years do we have to read this garbage?
@_date: 2014-10-15 16:47:57
What does this have to do with Bitcoin??
@_date: 2014-10-16 11:04:32
Don't bother backing up your claims with silly things such as proof. We'll take your word for it. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:17:17
I am a paid shill? 
@_date: 2014-10-16 09:22:11
The shit people type to start a Bitcoin circle jerk. Crazy. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 23:51:59
So all claims but no evidence?
@_date: 2014-10-17 22:38:56
Yes we know. Someone else already tried to start a circle jerk with this off topic news. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 08:11:45
Is there really not 1 post here where you don't lie?
Compulsive behavior much?
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:06:05
Another example how clueless she is:
"The currency is created when people compete to “mine” them. But, unlike gold, there isn’t a finite amount. New supplies of Bitcoins are created from a computer’s processing power and the users behind them."
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:45:20

A Bitcoiner in the Bitcoin sub expecting we will rally soon. I could've have never guessed this before clicking the link. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 01:54:46
No you can't estimate it. How the fuck are we supposed to do that. 
Really, what are all you people thinking. This question gets asked every single day. What goes on in your head exactly when you type this?
@_date: 2014-10-14 12:58:44
No clue what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 09:01:50
No, he works for Paypal, Paypal is the enemy so he is a shill. 
Anybody who isn't 100% supportive of Bitcoin here is a shill. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:58:55
Those chat logs filled me with rage. If i had to go through this i would have exploded. 
Please sue the fuck out of these people. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:04:09
Show me some examples. I'm waiting. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 17:26:14
No indeed. If someone steals your coins and buys something with it there is no customer protection whatsoever. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 07:58:22
How the fuck is anybody here supposed to know that exactly?
@_date: 2014-10-16 02:53:19
Can those who downvote me please tell me why. What part of my post is worthy of a downvote?
