The bite of the comment comes from the size of the tank. He's saying it's easy for coinbase to be the biggest fish in a tiny aquarium, and it's going to be jarring once they're swimming with Leviathans.

They might exist, but to say they can "enter circulation" isn't correct, no? Whole they may exist on the books for Coinbase, there is a strong cryptographic guarantee that they never leave. No such guarantee exists for fiat.

That's the funny thing. A bunch of those are private wallet keys, but one of them is a pirated copy of Windows 95, i saw a few high performance computing tools for cancer diagnosis (so, well done!), Some illegal black hat tools, a submission to wikileaks, and the social security numbers and credit card numbers of everyone ever born.

The moral is that if you don't lick the boots of the US empire, they'll suck all your currency out of your country and try to starve your people until they get their way. I'm sure the empire would happily spend a few trillion dollars to crash bitcoin if it meant they could continue to command subservience.

In an economic system EVERYONE is always acting in their own self interest at all times. That's the whole point.

I'm the past 24h, it's up 1.21% and in the past 72h it's up 32.72%. So there's that.

Iota has no mining fee and is quite fast.

Can't argue with that logic.

Any number can be a valid private key. Whether it's a key to a wallet containing any value is a different matter.

Iota. When miners constantly try to ruin everything for everyone, the natural refuge is a coin that doesn't depend on miners to be secure.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:16:13
Just truncate and take the decimal away, and voilà! Private key! (Or so say the hens)

There's no point of having protection of free speech limited to ideas you agree with.

The context here is that centralised payment channels are censoring gab, which is why their adoption of BTC is even necessary in the first place. Despite what you've heard, gab isn't solely or even largely about racism, though Twitter and Facebook and Reddit would love for you to believe thusly, because a competitor that can't be eliminated through corporate-governmental power structures is very dangerous to them.
So when they adopt a decentralised payment medium and you say "fuck racists", the implication is that you think they should be subjected to corporate censorship on some ground, in this case the cited perceived racism, and that you don't value freedom of expression when the expressed opinions are ones you disagree with.

To add to this, the knowledge of cause, spread broadly, changes the market in a fundamental way. When a huge sell wall shows up, people can know that it's not because something is broken about the protocol, that there's no reason to panic, and that it is the time to buy, not sell. Without knowing the cause, the reflex is to mitigate losses by selling.

Well, she wasn't central to breaking the world's entire economy a decade ago, so she has that going for her.

They've released troves of documents about Russia, about their invasion of Crimea, about Russian oligarchs. Come on man, don't double down on being poorly informed.

I bet you're one of these morons who thinks the DNC suing Russia is an incredibly good idea, too.

That's just CIA disinformation bullshite. The CIA hates competition, especially competition that is superior to them on a shoestring budget.

The thing they're afraid of isn't being caught not holding or being unable to buy a dominant asset, it's that many of the institutional advantages they've depended on disappear in a cryptocurrency world. For example, the CEO of Citi group can't just call the CEO of Bitcoin (lol) to increase federal lending or decrease interest rates to his liking like he does today. In a world with fully decentralised trustless exchanges dominated by transactions that lack numerous middle men, there's no one to pressure, no one to extort, no one to appeal to for bail-outs when you've gotten greedy and taken on more risk than you can afford.

They oppose whoever is misusing power. When they started, that was the bush admin in Iraq. Today, it's the democratic party, Google, Facebook, etc who hold more power than they can responsibly wield. If you don't understand how power dynamics work today, it probably feels like they're being incredibly unfair and that WikiLeaks is being "controlled" by something nefarious, when it's just your lack of objectivity and inability to overcome tribal tendencies playing out.
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:09:08
Yeah, BofA nuked this guy's accounts (a story retold by countless others) over something they're definitely not afraid of.
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:00:32
Either they're scared or they're mierenneukeren. Neither option is a good look.
@_date: 2018-04-23 04:15:21
You really think the CIA is in it for the public good? This is a legitimate question.

I will personally guarantee that the DNC will lose all three suits in spectacular fashion. Set a remind me for like a year from now and we will revisit this.
