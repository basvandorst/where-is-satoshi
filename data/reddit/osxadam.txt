I’m quite new into the BTC tech but noticed a lot of posts today talking about the high fees etc. Being able to use BTC on a daily basis would be awesome but are there ways the service can be improved or are the high fee posts not fully true/reliable?

Thanks for highlighting that ETH Escrow thing, not seen anything about that at all so will definitely look into it and re-consider! :)

I’ve seen a lot of posts today talking about BCash and high BTC fees, does any of this worry you or do you not take as much notice?
Litecoin and ETH is definitely interest too, I need to look into them a bit deeper as well tbh

Interesting! Not sure if this is related but a friend recently invested via Coinbase but didn’t end up with the same amount/BTC as was quoted when they were confirming their buy;
The confirmation said they were buying x amounts worth of BTC but they ended up with less value for money and he hadn’t been able to identify why so far ��

Do you think this could be a long term reality for BTC, especially considering all of the other cryptos that are popping up?
The impression that I’ve been getting from this sub and other articles is that banks are definitely feeling threatened by BTC

That’s what it’s all about man, having security is a lovely freedom to have! :)
Wish I’d taken the plunge years ago but unfortunately was swayed away as I’m sure many others were and totally regretting it now! ��

Out of interest, what makes you confident that it’s a good move as an investment? Do you think it’s too far gone now to crash?
*Been hugely into BTC for a few years myself but always from the back seat. Recently jumped into the fray but am trying to educate myself on the reason others are confident about its future :)
