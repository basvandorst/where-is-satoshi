I remember a time when AOL snail mailed their internet/email access software to every home in the United States. Started with 3.5" floppies, and eventual evolved to CD-ROM. The .com boomers tried to convince people to use the internet through international marketing and advertising, and also campaigned for mainstream investors to dump mass savings in a wave of startups few of which had any feasible sustainability.

This is a genius idea, but I don't think the self pour aspect would work in most bar or restaurant setting. When you take the pouring out of the hands of the establishment's hired servers you run into a slew of legal, regulatory and health issues. 
Still no reason you cant put his idea behind the bar and maintain the pay by the ounce with bitcoin angle.

Mail the buyer a paper wallet to their verified address, get tracking, signature if over $250 or for extra assurance. Even if the buyer files a chargeback with their bank you will likely be covered by seller protection.

When in fact, along with the internet they were all invented in the early 90s by Al Gore.

I'm curious about Bitcoin and I'm an international art thief. Also a pedophile.

Season 8 episode 19 - My Sister, My Sitter. Marge and homer go to a gala opening of a boardwalk shopping area. They can't find a sitter and decide to give Lisa a shot since has been running a successful babysitting business. Hilarity ensues. 
Even if you have seen them all there are lots of little things you miss, or correlations you don't make unless you see the full episode. I have seen all of at least the first 18 seasons, and almost every episode total. I recently started watching them all from the beginning again. You pick up something new every time, and the classic gags still get ya.

This is what I was looking for. I really need to get armory going. I was a little put off with playing around with pgp to get the offline wallet running, but I know it's pretty easy once you get past the initial learning hump. 
I guess it's really an instant gratification thing, and I would have realized that if i thought hard enough on it. I can use what's immediately at my disposal for a fairly secure method, or take an hour or two to learn and set up a system I will be able to use continually. 
If I am going to use a Linux boot, what is the best method to generate the keys? What is the best way to save and retrieve the gimp files? I have looked up how to use my printer on a linux system and it seemed really complicated.

I am a long time Bitcoiner and South Florida resident. I have had moderate interest in the Bitcoin conference since it moved to Miami and have had some minor BTC related developments I tinkered with over the last couple years. The scheduled event didn't seem worth the ticket price and an hour drive.
I don't know the details of these accusations, I never even heard of Paycoin before this controversy, but I can tell from the response that many people feel they have been wronged.  If someone can put together a really good case, and some questions that people here feel deserve answering, I would be willing to attend the conference and do whatever I could to get on the mic.

OK. I'm in with you on this. My car i shaving transmission problems, and I might only be able able to get around $1k if I sell it in a hurry. But I will list it for sale on craigslist and BitcoinTalk if the price touches $125. Will buy a bicycle and put the rest into BTC.

In mainstream finance can't you avoid that by using call/put options with trailing stop losses?

OK, now this is a great option, as I have 2 lying around. But what distro? Just Raspbian, or a pre-formatted on made for BTC? And if it's never connected to the internet, what do I have to put on it to be able to generate the addresses? What is the best way to print or securely transfer the files? I fired up one of my Pi's running raspbian, but there were a couple missing components I would need to generate, layout, print, and destroy digital copies of paper wallets.

I have used this software for many years to watch stolen porn, movies, and tv shows. I will gladly donate 0.01 BTC and 0.1 LTC

The only meetup I have heard of is the coffee shop in Miami that accepts bitcoin. I am in North Broward, so Miami can be an hour+ dive for me. I'm interested to hear how productive they are as bitcoin has consumed my life and I have various projects going on.

To me it sounds more like he is intentionally spreading misinformation, which leads me to wonder what the true motivation behind this is. I typed bitcoin into my local cl for sale section out of curiosity. This was one of the first things i found, I thought this sub may find it interesting/entertaining.

Wow, I didn't know that was in Miami this year. I was planning to go to CA next year, this one is down the street. I think I will have to.
