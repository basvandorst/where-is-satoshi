For some reason I think this guy is actually being serious
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:08:04
check again. I bought at the correction.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:59:41
Yea this guy is a fucking dumbass
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:32:11
because he's a kook
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:19:14
First they're zour, then they're zweet
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:35:18
So I dont need to if i'm hodling?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:23:41
hell, I'd do that for a klondike bar
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:04:49
Is it not a legit fear? I'm super OCD about everything. I don't want to screw something up. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:20:36
lol I know I was just kidding
Edit: I mean, it actually kinda is in a way though now  that I think about it
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:33:42
I invested my life savings into dogecoin
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:53:24
hahah just read about that. Poor US govt.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:57:45
Only a SITH deals in absolutes...
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:23:03
Yup. And they accept Bitcoin too!
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:47:19
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:57:33
Wait. It's projected to hit 100 Jillion?!??!? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:44:35
What do YOU think will be the peak?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:58:20
Ahhh, I love Shakespeare
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:42:10

I DON'T WANNA FUCKING SPEND MY GODDAMN BITCOIN OKAY?!?!?!
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:13:08

ONE MILLION DOLLARS
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:08:23
Wait......there are other countries?
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:57:12
ahhh, was waiting for the first guy with a low IQ to comment
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:51:53
C P U U L T R A
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:23:03
You should listen to this guy. He sounds legit.

@_date: 2017-12-17 00:46:11
Thanks for this!
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:43:07
Then how will I get drunk?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:09:48
that idea just may be crazy enough to work
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:23:17
The answer is just one click away!
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:32:52
No. But there are "better" dogs.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:57:26
time to get some cash man. No fucking way we're gonna let you spend your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:48:50
The funniest thing is that the same people panicking have only put a couple hundred in. It's like they spent 170 dollars, and Bitcoin goes from 17000 to 14000 and they freak out. It's like, dude, you "lost" like 30 bucks, calm the fuck down.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:31:58
are you serious?
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:08:34
Nice dude! I actually really dig that design man. Great job!
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:37:36
DogeCoin, MemeCoin, etc
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:10:29
Dont act like this is some punishment lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:31:52
I think you're better off investing in Dogecoin.....
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:14:08
Well, if it makes you feel any better, it doesn't really work in the US either
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:21:18
I'm gonna go to sleep man. Good night bro.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:16:14
Welp. Time to move on with my life.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:10:45
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:29:07
i think i'm gay
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:38:32
Bitcoin is the prince that was promised
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:18:02
annnnd it's unclear!
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:08:32
I already sold our family dog
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:52:47
yea. I wanna fucking kill myself man. The suspense!
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:53:27
LOL wtf
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:53:42
WE LOVE YOU SATOSHIIIIII
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:31:58
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:06:58
I'm happy that you're happy that he's happy
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:08:27
along with my hopes and dreams
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:34:33
Outside? What's that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:44:35
That exceeds the market cap possibility though lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:18:38
Kroner isn't money. It's an evil scientist.

@_date: 2017-12-06 07:15:37
:( I was just trying to get rich
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:17:20
The worst being that I did it on CoinBase and actually bought in at 12,730
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:27:56
dude I need to fucking get rid of this shit quick
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:46:13
did your bank get charged?
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:23:24
I'm still a noob at this as well, but the general thing people keep telling me is that it is best to avoid keeping/sending/selling on CoinBase. They charge a ton of fees. Alot of people have been recommending either GDAX, or using a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:23:20
But shouldn't you be careful? Someone might have sent it by accident and would do anything to get it back.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:34:38
You can't say that YOU wouldn't
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:49:56
Check your wallet ;)
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:46:05
COINfucius lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:15:56
One of the commentors in this thread said it would be around 5million worth of selling
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:35:51
i wish. Coinbase has it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:54:57
...what are you saying?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:49:39
Yet you post a link to this video.....
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:14:42

@_date: 2017-12-06 07:18:00
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:53:58
Outside?!?!? There's no fucking Bitcoin price charts outside dude. What the fuck kind of advice is this!??!
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:46:17
Read the negative reviews on Amazon. You'll see a good amount of people posting shit about it seeming like the Nano had been tampered with. It's enough people that I would definitely be too sketched to order from Amazon.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:01:48
make sure you make your private keys public
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:34:50
Makes sense. If it does though, will you promise to send me .5 BTC? Because I predicted it?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:24:11
My daughter was really upset, but I told her that I'm gonna use our gains from Bitcoin to buy an even better dog.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:59:25
Jesus. Let us know what's in it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:49:27
It's basically a fee, disguised as "speculation" on their part. They're really just making a huge profit of you.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:35:40
What team? The Black Bitcoin Boys?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:31:07
because you're lying?
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:36:15
outdated as hell lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:28:25
Not for a single Klondike bar, no.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:24:39
has this whole posting your wallet address thing ever worked? Have you ever gotten an anonymous gift?
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:27:55
with a cocktail bar and plenty of refreshments
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:19:57
Order from the Ledger Nano website. Don't trust Amazon. I've heard about some sketchy shit going on. Your concerns aren't paranoia.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:36:36
I'm in College, so 100%
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:43:47
In fairness, he didn't mention the direction of the correction XD
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:34:04
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:10:51
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:38:00
And coincidentally the guy you killed had his private keys on a note in  his pocket that were tied to an account containing 10,000 Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:49:36
If Bitcoin charts made moaning noises in tandem with spikes and dips, I would full screen that shit in a heartbeat
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:32:41
I'll give them 900,000 Satoshi
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:22:36
LOL the title links to "don't invest recklessly"
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:54:19
So the ones that are already there are only for use with Coinbase purchases?
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:47:42
not as much as she was......wait....wat
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:05:59
oh lol. I didn't know you lived in BULGARIA! sorry jk too soon!, I'm tired, took too much benadryl and xanax and I just wanna see 10k :(
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:36:11
Can I just transfer accounts from CoinBase to GDAX? Or do i have to set up a wallet and send over the currency manually?
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:38:23
i met my wife at a Bitcoin orgy
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:51:37
yea you are
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:03:47
seriously tho. I had to jack off with a cheese grater to keep myself up, and I'm still having trouble staying up
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:50:51
It's a money roller coaster, with clouds covering the upcoming peaks and falls
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:06:49
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:16:03
yea. By like 20 mins
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:25:57
It took less than 30 mins for all that to happen. You're late to the game bruh.
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:00:01
I'm sorry, I dont quite understand. "Half the reward for each found block could lead to doubling BTC price." That just sounds illogical in my head.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:23:35
Your spelling is the real joke
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:00:58
There was a "BTC Wallet" that already came with it when i downloaded the app. Everytime I purchase from Coinbase, it is deposited into this wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:19:04
I know this is speculative, but when do YOU think price fluctuations will stop?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:03:10
So far just mobile app, but I can log into my PC if I have to. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:15:40
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:47:17
And this is automatically done? Or do I have to configure all my crypto to be in a vault?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:29:30
Then why doesn't everyone use it? Why do so many people still use CoinBase? What's the catch?
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:03:54
Any tips on the best way to back up? I currently have everything in my Coinbase wallet and vaults
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:48:21
I only have .062 of a coin :(
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:19:00
What do you think of this plan: I want to take out more student loans than I need, buy some BTC, and then be able to pay off the rest of my student loans with the future profit
Edit: I just realized how stupid of a question this is. Either way, I still kinda wanna know the answer.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:55:27
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:05:10
are we dealing with private keys if we are doing this through CoinBase?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:59:16
More news coverage, which will also boost the value from people now knowing they need to invest!!! 10k is by media standards, going to be a point where they cannot ignore reporting more on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:12:57
Ok I just did it, but how is this any more secure than the wallet? They're both owned by CoinBase and seem to reside in the same location
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:04:00
Ahhh ok I got it. Thank you! I still have 5 more days!
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:35:49
Vault them? Is that just another layer of protection above what coinbase is providing? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:34:16
oh ok. So that is bad news for miners, right? This could potentially make it pointless to mine?
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:47:35
You're pretty close. I'd put in the rest of the ~2500 and get your full coin before prices skyrocket
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:29:39
What happens during halvening? Will the price go up or down? The name makes it seem like it would go down for some reason.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:55:07
It doesn't show a delivery date. Just the date I purchased it. They all say "pending" as well. I mean, wtf, why would they take it out of my bank account and then wait a week and then give me coin??
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:10:29
For some reason the address keeps changing from the last one I saw. I logged into the CoinBase desktop app and it shows a ton of different addresses. What happens if I use an old address? Does it still go through?
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:54:51
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:56:01
Seems pretty effective
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:17:31
What does this mean? We need to get our coins out ASAP?
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:48:04
I thought they were insured, though. Does that not matter when they go out of business? They'll just keep our coins???
