I think anytime you ask for trading advice, especially in crypto, it'll be impartial. So I figure if I can get enough answers from both bulls and bears and take the average of that, maybe it'll get me somewhere :D

Quick update - 2 more BTC bought at 450:)

Thanks for that analysis!  you and another poster made the good point on traders holding onto a lot of BTC at avg prices in the 400, which means a lot of people are going to be happy selling at 450-500 and well get some sell walls.
Also you are very right on the first point, but i feel like any time you trade BTC it is a time of volatility, sometimes more sometimes less but inherently the vega is hugeeeeee.

Right! I figure the worst BTC can do in the coming months is 200, lets say worst case scenario. Realistically it could spike to 1000 again, or hell who knows skys the limit. So the risk downward is pretty sweet compared to the potential. Also Ukraine is just heating up again after a shaky ceasefire, the RUR is the lowest its been in ages, and in general lots of areas of economic/social instability.
Now, does anyone think it will correct under 400 within next day or so? Otherwise I think I am buying 2 more in a few minutes.

Thanks for the feedback man. Many people i talked to in the crypto currency forums/pump groups believe sr going down was the spark for the run last year. I mean look it went down, then we see a huge spike. Now SR2 went down, and i was told to get into BTC asap as it would spike within a day or os. Now we see that spike, i mean to me it seems pretty evident SR going down had an effect on the market... just from looking at charts right after SR 1/2 have gone down. But again, you never know, but this is what people have been expressing to me. What do you think on the RUR argument,  andappreciate your input!

Newb at crypto, been doing penny stocks for years so have an understanding of TA and unfortunately am all to willing to jump on high volatility. 
Kind of a no info reply for me, what do you actually think is going to happen to the market and why?

haha I like that comment, it's a good reminder to always sit down and think before you push that BTC order in. 
I should post a new bull thread with this link " Come on guys they are so cheappp now, Raoul paul says so!

Right that's why I am bringing up the two points : Silk road 2 has gone down, we are seeing the same kind of spikes we saw after silk road 1 went down (which was a huge bull rush). RUR is at an all time low and Ukraine has just gotten itself back in the mainstream news, so Russian BTC markets are heating up.  So my thought is in the next few weeks we will see a contiuining upward trend with little correction, of course the duration or amount is completely subjective but looking at the historic charts and what happened in the previous spikes I really believe it should go over 500.
Again though, that is just my informed guessing, please rebut me if you don't agree !

ill get my weighted dice:)

I like the technology for the long term, especially in the coming years. However I'm doing more trading than I usually would just because of the run that happened when silk road 1 went down and again the general instability in European markets. Do you guys think silk road 2 going down will have that much of a significant impact?
