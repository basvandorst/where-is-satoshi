Yes, but I mean more regarding governments and people knowing you have it, and cracking down on you with double tax penalties (especially when /if you eventually cash some out, robbers fucking you up, etc. 
If it really blows up this is millions we are talking about

What does string privacy coin mean
@_date: 2019-07-23 20:44:05
I feel like one day shit is going to go DOWN once it takes over and reaches it’s true value through:
Government attempts to take it from owners
Viruses for finding btc owners, etc. 
So far this is the reason I want to buy but haven’t . I don’t know how to do it absolutely securely

Oh you know you’d go get her if she came after you

Thanks I found a few that seem to be a real option. You were very helpful. 
To be honest EU is hte important thing, as buying online between the different countries doesn't seem to be an option unless the gift cards can only be exchanged within the same country.

It is just a preference. If BTC truly will become as large as everyone says it will, I think one day crackdowns against it might start happening and/or extortion. 
Therefore I would prefer to buy with non kyc, and with non bank/credit card options.

Hi there, 
Location=NL, 
1-200 right away and then continuous maybe in smaller amounts weekly.
Payment methods would be preferred over gift card as financial privacy is very important to me. 
I wouldn't need immediate access to proceeds as I will only be holding. Within 1-2 day transfer possibility to a cold wallet would be desired however.

My reasoning for this is that I plan on holding these coins for a very long time.
I  see one day national crackdowns (due to threat to the dollar/banking  systems), as well as extortion a possibility. Therefore I wanted to very  securely purchase them.
The other  option is that I exchange them back for fiat in the near future  instead. At that point I am not sure if I can simply list the gains, or  need to prove the process for how I came to own them.
This would likely determine if I would go for option 1 or 2, or maybe I just get a few anonymously and a few the normal way.
You seem to be very knowledgeable, so feel free to weigh in if you like :)

Hey Flip, 
Thanks for your reply. 
Yeah there are, but I usually have to drive about 2 hours total to get to them (there and back). 
That would be the easy option. I am trying to however come up with a sustainable long term option for acquiring them.

I am somewhat new to Reddit, and have been too lazy to scour the Internet for overall guides and put them together.
I saw a few cards listed under the “.about section”
Are they current/accurate regarding where I should store my bitcoins?
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:04:11
I am extremely new to BTC . By this you mean keep a small amount to make short wins within the day ?
In order to be close enough to the market to do this swing trading are you forced to give up a lot  of your anonymity ? 
If there is any way you would be willing to divulge which medium/market (or maybe it’s your own node?) you use to do this I would be eternally grateful (if you have the time to send a message, I’d love to learn more)

Paranoid New guy Trying to save some time (currently going through all the guided you guys have listed under this Subreddit)  and living in Germany. 
Is there any option for buying bitcoin completely anonymously to cut to the chase ?
