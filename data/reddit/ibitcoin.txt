It is interesting to think about what Warren Buffett would think about Bitcoin. He'd almost certainly dismiss the idea offhand because it has no intrinsic value and he is against speculation, but  he has mixed feelings about the dollar. When asked about gold as an investment he mentioned:
"I’m not advocating paper money – it’s good to worry about this. But I’d rather sell one pound of candy. That will retain its value even if the currency is seashells." [Warren Buffett](
So he sees flaws in the dollar but I am still almost certain that he wouldn't invest in Bitcoin because he doesn't believe in speculating but I think his framework of looking at how large of a durable competitive advantage (a moat) around the currency is incredibly important. 
* **First mover advantage**: as being the first cryptocurrency of it's kind has led to many benefits. Being "the original" has a lot of advantages and mostly fuels the other durable competitive advantages.
* **A more mature ecosystem**: from MtHox to silkroad to many others, there are more services built around bitcoin. It is hard to know how durable this advantage is as many of these services could start accepting and working with other cryptocurrencies as well. For example, see MtGox's upcoming announcement about supporting litecoin
* **Brand**: BitCoin is getting a ton of press and it is the only cryptocurrency that a sizable number of people have heard of
* **The underlying story and the desire and influence of Bitcoin holders**: This prevents other competing currencies from gaining traction because the people who would support a different currency likely are already invested in Bitcoin and want to see Bitcoin appreciate in value. Bitcoin has an incredibly compelling story that many people love to talk about, especially among nerds. This is spreading to the finance and libertarian communities and also to the mainstream. The underlying story is damn cool and competitors will likely be deemed knock offs.
* **Network Effects**: as more people hold and transact with BitCoin, the more valuable it gets for each person. I don't know how hard this is to duplicate and how big of a head start this is but it is incredibly important to think about if you own or are thinking about buying BitCoin.
* **Fragmentation of competitors**: There are a ton of competing cryptocurrencies and it is very difficult to get consensus about which one or ones are worthwhile and they distract and detract from each other. In a way, each competitor further legitimizes cryptocurrencies as an idea which is a good thing for Bitcoin. 
**Flaws in the moat**
* **It is still early**: $2 billion+ seems like a ton of money but it is still a tiny bit as far as currency goes. The world's gold supply is worth $8 trillion. A lot can still happen
* **Extreme volatility**: It'd be useful for certain use cases if BitCoin stayed at a relatively constant price. Maybe this will happen at some point but likely not any time soon. I don't know exactly how a competing currency could solve this issue but possibly a digital version of a government issued currency or a digital version of a basket of investment goods could solve this problem.
* **Risk of lost faith after a crash**: Bitcoin has already had large fluctuations in value and if a lot of people lose a lot of money they will lost faith. See the tech world in the early 2000s as an example. This is potentially something that can be overcame but it is tough
* **Difficulty of use**: Buying Bitcoins is difficult and the potential to lose them or have them stolen sucks. It is still the wild west days but if some competitor was easier to use, it could take over.
* **Ground floor psychology**: Some people feel like it is already too late to benefit from Bitcoin but'd love to get involved in the next one from the ground floor which could help buoy a competitor.
* **Potential flaws in the Bitcoin software or economic principle**: Risks of the system being hacked (very unlikely) exist or people could come to a consensus about some specific other cryptocurrency is better, it could take off.
* **Cryptocurrencies may not be valuable in general**: There is a chance no cryptocurrency or even any digital currency takes off and it ends up being a relatively worthless category. There are a ton of very valuable uses of cryptocurrencies so I find this unlikely but it is a real risk and something that most regular people will talk about.
In conclusion, if you want Bitcoin to take off, the goal is to make BitCoin like Coca Cola. Known about everywhere. For sale at tons of places. Available in many different forms. Deeply trusted. An advanced supply chain and services around the good. You could even say there is a paralel between the secret recipe for Coca Cola and the cryptography of Bitcoin but that is a stretch.
A Pepsi to Bitcoin's Coke, a silver to Bitcoin's Gold may emerge. Or something may even eclipse Bitcoin and that is very possible but I think it'll be very difficult to do. It'll be fun to watch.

What is bitcoin's fundamental value? 
It doesn't exist...it is whatever the market values it at. It has an incredible story behind it and for it to be fully useful as a currency it will likely have to be worth 100s of billions or trillions of dollars. It is impossible to calculate how likely that outcome is though.
Warren Buffett admits that he doesn't understand technology and he hates speculating...I find it incredibly unlikely that he'd buy any bitcoin. His currency contracts were based on protecting Berkshire Hathaway from the decreasing value of the dollar. There is an incredibly tiny chance that he could see bitcoin as a hedge but I think we'd all be super surprised if he invested in bitcoin.

It definitely can be taken away. On rare occasion the first mover wins. It is just very hard to know how it'll play out and it is very interesting to think about.
