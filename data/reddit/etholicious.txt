The problem is that the banksters and their cohorts in governments are the biggest "money launderers" of all. Personally I think "money laundering" is just another made up "crime" used by those in power to destroy financial privacy and put the screws on the taxpayer. 
The ideal virtual currency in my mind is private, uncensorable, and non-permissioned regardless of the alleged risks brought about by greater financial liberty.

All three. I'm not sure I'm quite understanding you...are you talking about use cases for establishing an identity on the blockchain?
My statement was aimed specifically at the virtual currency function of a blockchain.

The hostility towards Ethereum is mind boggling, talk about short sighted and lacking any real understanding.

I've known about bitcoin since late 2008 when I stumbled across the white paper while researching digital money. I have both bitcoin and ethereum as well as others. I think putting all your eggs in one basket is idiotic, but I digress. Your approach to all of this like I said is very short sighted, narrow minded, and lacks any genuine understanding of the underlying technologies.
I think we're about done here, no? Anything novel to say?

Sure one can give preference, people make the trade off when they speculate too, my point is that Ether is not designed to be a store of value like Bitcoin, it's designed to pay for gas in order to run smart contracts. And the two systems have a great potential to benefit one another. BTC relay is a great example, so is Plutus.it. There will be many more to come as the two systems form a symbiotic relationship.


Okay? Cool story bro. Protip - don't invest using your emotions.

Did you eat paint chips as a kid?
Look I don't know how to break it down for you any more simply, if you can't see how the two systems are already complimenting each other then I think this conversation is lost on you. I think you are incredibly short sighted and also lack a basic understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of either system.

Sounds like a request for some consulting work.

Ethereum clones?

How much $$ were they offering?

Eth guy here. Great news for both bitcoin and ethereum. We are not competitors, we are going to make each other stronger my brothers and sisters. To da moon, together!

My original statement was directed towards the sentiment many have that Bitcoin and Ethereum were supposed to be at odds with one another. Your argument is that they compete because you can put your resources toward one or the other, which I conceded, of course that's true, but you're still missing my main point (by some miracle), which is, once again, that the two systems compliment each other and will make each other stronger. 
A $7 billion dollar market cap and a $800 million dollar market cap is peanuts, if you're worried about the little decisions people are making about how much they're putting in one or the other you are missing the bigger picture. What's important is to understand the strengths of either chain and how they can really strengthen each other. In the next few years BTC and ETH are going to do big things. This is what you obviously cannot grasp with your "I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever" attitude.


Should I direct you to a safe space?
