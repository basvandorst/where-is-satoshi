Circle really hasn't figured out who they are and what they are doing. Their app is a hodgepodge of beautiful and ugly looking parts the last time I checked. 
Rest assured that once it does roll out that they will invite all of your contacts repeatedly (a la Candy Crush Saga).

Their current leader is in year 12 of a 4 year term and is very unpopular.
Last time the main political parties had a big disagreement, there were gun battles in the street and kidnappings of the other party.
Plus this government pays out millions of dollars each month to the families of people who have committed attacks.
I wish them luck
