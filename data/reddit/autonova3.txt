1. The distinction between labor and labor power (a special commodity characterized by its property of producing more value than the value of commodities that the worker buys with his money wage and consumes in order to reproduce his capacity to work). 
2. The law of increasing concentration and centralization of capital. 
3. The law of the falling rate of profit. This law is derived from the very purpose of capitalist production, which is the extraction of profits as an end in itself. As mentioned above, the realization of this goal entails mechanization of the production process through the introduction of fixed capital. On the one hand, this raises both the productivity of labor and profits for the firms that remain following concentration; on the other hand, however, the increase of fixed capital relative to labor leads to a falling profit rate. Thus capitalism is both a growth-and crisis-prone system, as has also been documented in the literature on long economic cycles.

It’s democratic ownership of the factory and therefore the profits that it makes. The individual (or small group of individuals) that own the factory under a laissez-faire capitalist system would not take all the profits - the workers would.

Well, socialism is the direct control of production ie working for a company where you hold a share in the profits and have a say in decisions. These exist around the world and do fine. The closest that entire countries have to pure socialism is taxes which pay for things everyone has access to, and voting for representatives in government which then supposedly make economic decisions based on what they promised voters. This system is blatantly broken since huge businesses donate billions to candidates to serve their agendas, and campaign promises to voters can be broken no problem. But this is the only democratic control over the economy that the people have. It needs to be changed, but government should not be weakened. Indeed, billionaires [fund libertarian politicians significantly]( because a weaker government means weaker democratic control from the people, and therefore more control by billionaires.

[Most booms do not go bust, Article by John Authers]( (hidden behind paywall). Copied below:
Is there really such a thing as a market bubble? I feel almost heretical answering this question. I and most readers have lived through two decades that were dominated by two vast investment bubbles and the attempt to deal with their consequences when they burst.
Getting into definitions is beside the point. As US Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once said to define pornography: “I know it when I see it.” And there is no point in arguing that the dotcom bubble that came to a head in 2000, or the credit bubble that burst seven years later, were not bubbles. I know a bubble when I see one, and they were bubbles. For those of my generation, spotting bubbles before they get too big, and thwarting them, seems to be vital for regulators and investors alike.
The history of financial bubbles is long and fascinating. The greatest bubbles in history have many common characteristics. After the disasters of recent years, investors have been spurred to rake over that history. Events from the 16th century Dutch tulip bubble through to the Panic of 1907 have been raked over for their significance
But in a great new compendium on financial history, several writers make the same points. The number of bubbles in history is very small. That makes it hard to draw any valid inferences from them. Further, definition is a real problem, and not just one for linguistic nitpickers. History’s acknowledged bubbles all have one critical factor in common; they burst. But that gives us a one-sided view. We need to look at those bubbles that did not burst and the crises that did not happen.
Once looked at this way, the dilemmas of dealing with bubbles grow more intractable. It is harder for investors to take evasive action. The critical policy question of whether central banks and regulators should prevent the formation of bubbles also grows harder to answer.
Yale’s Will Goetzmann complains that bubbles are booms that go bad — “but not all booms are bad”. Using data for national indices from a range of countries in the 20th century, he found that after a boom, crashes that gave back all of their previous gain were more rare than instances where prices doubled again.
He defined a bubble as an extreme acceleration in share prices. In one version, he required them to double in a year — which excluded the dotcom bubble and the Great Crash of 1929. To keep them in, he also tried a softer version where stocks doubled in three years.
The background history to these booms confirmed what historians of bubbles had already shown: that they always have at least some backing from the fundamentals. Bubbles may end up being irrationally expensive, but they are not stupid. They arrive when an exciting new development — canals, railways, the internet — creates confusion over the future value they will create. As he puts it, “there was at least some method to the madness of investors”.
He found 72 cases of a market doubling in a year. In the following year, six doubled again, and three halved, giving back all their gains: Argentina in 1977, Austria in 1924 and Poland in 1994
For doubling in three years, he found 460 examples. In the following five years, 10.4 per cent of them halved. The possibility of halving in any three-year period, regardless of what had come before, was lower than this but not dramatically so: 6 per cent.
On this basis, arguments made by many (including me) that central banks should concentrate more on pricking bubbles before they get too big begin to look threadbare. At a minimum, he has provided historians with a fascinating new pool of bubbles that we should now try to explore. They range from the easy to explain — anyone who knows anything about 20th century history can work out why the German stock market dropped 84 per cent in the five years after it doubled in 1940 — to the far more baffling. If any reader knows what went wrong for New Zealand stocks after 1986, or Norwegian stocks after 1973, it would be most interesting to hear.
As for the booms that went on, try postwar Germany, Peru in the late 1980s, Russia after 1999 — it almost trebled in the following five years, in the early stage of Vladimir Putin’s pre-eminence — or even the UK in 1975. UK stocks doubled that year, and trebled again by the end of the decade.
How should investors deal with this? Getting out altogether when a market grows overheated is dangerous. You give up on the extra premium that the market normally gives you for taking the extra risk of buying stocks. And attempting to time the market based on valuation does not work. As Mr Goetzmann’s essays show, markets can easily grow even more overheated.
I hate to repeat what I have said many times before, but rebalancing has much to be said for it. Steadily take profits each year as markets rise, and over time you will gain. In the long run, buying something that is obviously expensive seldom works out. Beyond that, remember that some booms do not go bust.

If someone proposed getting rid of child education now, so children could work, they’d be laughed out of town.

It's getting harder and harder to mine them - the block reward (how much a miner gets for mining) halves every few years. The next halving is in 2020. The last bitcoin will be mined on the 7th May 2140. But it is still valuable way before then. Explanation (given elsewhere on this thread):
"The better way to think of bitcoin’s scarcity is in terms of inflation. Gold will grow something like 1-2% per year, basically forever (we’ll mine the bottom of the ocean, then asteroids if the price is sufficiently high). If the price goes up there’s more incentive to produce supply so more miners enter the race and more supply is produced until an equilibrium is reached.
Bitcoin differs from gold here in that the rate of inflation is fixed. No matter how many miners enter the race. So when the price skyrockets in value, there is no increase in the supply of coins produced. The rate of inflation is locked in, currently at 3.75%, but will be 1.8% by 2020, and less than half that 4 years later.
This is what makes bitcoin uniquely rare. Every other commodity on the planet reacts, creating more supply when the price rises. Bitcoin doesn’t, so it’s subject to insane growth as the supply locks up.
Couple that with that it’s theoretically a better form of money than government currency (you can beam it across boarders / is programmable and digit from the ground up) and you can see why there are some that think this is going to eat the world."

First of all, you can’t really say “only 44%” when talking about an investment. 44% in a year is a stellar return in relation to conventional investments.
Secondly, the risk is that bitcoin falls to zero value. There is no conceivable way this could happen.

Genuinely what happens
@_date: 2018-08-17 09:50:56
It's getting harder and harder to create more bitcoin. They are created as a reward for the miners for verifying the network with their computing power. By the time 21m bitcoins are mined, the rewards for the miners will be in the form of transaction fees alone. So if I sent you 1 BTC, say 0.99 BTC would reach you, and the miner would take 0.01 BTC for processing the transaction.

No - there can only ever be 21 million bitcoin. It's scarce, like gold. In fact, it's more scarce than gold. The Earth's crust is vast, and more gold can be mined. Asteroids could conceivably be mined for gold. It is impossible to produce more than 21 million bitcoin.

The phrase is one of those conventional maxims which traditional investors need to say to clients. It may apply to stocks of companies, because they are naturally variable - companies go bankrupt, management can change, governments can change tax rules, other companies can buy them out. With bitcoin, all the key elements have remained the same. Humans are still buying bitcoins, and humans are broadly speaking the same. The general operation of the network has stayed the same. The only things that have changed have actually changed for the better - the transaction technology has been improved, and, crucially, adoption has improved.

Without a value token for the miners to be working to acquire, there's no incentive to mining, which means no one would volunteer their energy to safeguard the network, so the entire system doesn't work. It's a perfect economic loop. If you remove one element of it the whole thing falls apart.

Because people erroneously think of bitcoin like they think of stocks. They see a price movement and they scan the news for something to explain it. What they don’t take into account is how huge and global bitcoin is. If you look at the past price movements you can see the crowd reacting the exact same way before, only on a smaller market. All that drives bitcoin’s price is psychology. The time for external events being able to influence it has passed.
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:58:48
Gold is bigger than bitcoin, so it would be less volatile, ie the movements are slower. Widening the time axis is therefore valid for comparison. The same thing can be done in bitcoin itself - comparing the 2013 crash with the 2018 one reveals basically the same shape.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:55:47

So if you bought a bitcoin now you would have enough for a house in a few years - either swapping for fiat money to pay, or paying directly with bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-05 22:17:34
You're right to be confused. Bitcoin has most of the properties that money has, apart from stability. For now, because Bitcoin is a new technology, its value is rising very fast, because more and more people every day are seeing it as the future, and so its demand and therefore value is increasing. So actually paying for something with Bitcoin now isn't advisable. Holding Bitcoin long term, until the prices stabilise, however, is advisable.

Say I'm in a stationary car, parked next to a flag, and I floor the accelerator. If I were to make a chart of the car's distance from the flag, it would look like an exponential function - getting steeper and steeper all the time.
However, if I were to make a chart of the car's *velocity* over time, it would be a straight line. In effect, this is what the chart above is showing. Bitcoin is increasing faster and faster, but it's harder and harder to progress up through the vertical logarithmic axis. In theory, these two things cancel out, and you're left with a straight line chart, as in the car's velocity. Of course, nothing in reality is perfect, hence the bumpy lines in our chart, owing to external factors such as China banning bitcoin, etc.

If Bitcoin’s value is really in the Blockchain and the network itself, and the Blockchain tech is an open source code, doesn’t that mean bitcoin is not scarce? Couldn’t I just take the code and create my own bitcoin network with the same capabilities?

Income tax would be only part of it. Cracking down on tax avoidance and having a wealth tax would raise around 3 trillion over 10 years.


And America is not capitalist (a purely capitalist country would collapse very quickly). No 100% capitalist or 100% socialist countries exist.
Scandinavian countries are the most equal and happiest in the world, so they can afford to have lower taxes on their richest. Their social safety net is much higher.

Next sentence of the wiki article: "Social ownership can be public (state), collective or cooperative ownership, or citizen ownership of equity."
Also: "Originating within the socialist movement, social democracy has embraced a mixed economy with a market that includes substantial state intervention in the form of income redistribution, regulation, and a welfare state."
What would you advocate as the solution to increasing inequality and runaway climate change? Those are the two biggest problems of the 21st century and I think the only way to solve them is more government intervention.

He said "The Nordic model is an expanded welfare state which provides a high level of security for its citizens, but it is also a successful market economy with much freedom to pursue your dreams and live your life as you wish". Its expanded welfare state comes from taxes, which is a form of socialism. It has higher taxes and a bigger welfare state than the US. Therefore it is more socialist.
@_date: 2019-04-07 20:54:08
The problem is dynamic. You wouldn't constantly tax the wealthy to fund the social safety net. The USA is one of the most unequal in the world. My solution would be to start by taxing the super wealthy and the corporations to fund a massive infrastructure development program, universal healthcare and Finland-style education system. This would improve the poorest communities and lead to an education-fuelled productivity boom. This would massively expand the middle class. Then, when the middle class is starting to gain momentum and have more wealth, you could gradually increase the income tax from the bottom downwards. This only happens once the society has generally become a lot more equal. The immediate priority is to get the vast wealth horded by the super wealthy to re-circulate into the economy though.

“Back in 2007, Bruce Schneier reported on a backdoor found in NIST’s Dual_EC_DRBG random number generator:
But today there’s an even bigger stink brewing around Dual_EC_DRBG. In an informal presentation(.pdf) at the CRYPTO 2007 conference in August, Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson showed that the algorithm contains a weakness that can only be described as a backdoor.
This is how it works: There are a bunch of constants — fixed numbers — in the standard used to define the algorithm’s elliptic curve. These constants are listed in Appendix A of the NIST publication, but nowhere is it explained where they came from.
What Shumow and Ferguson showed is that these numbers have a relationship with a second, secret set of numbers that can act as a kind of skeleton key. If you know the secret numbers, you can predict the output of the random-number generator after collecting just 32 bytes of its output. To put that in real terms, you only need to monitor one TLS internet encryption connection in order to crack the security of that protocol. If you know the secret numbers, you can completely break any instantiation of Dual_EC_DRBG.
This is important because random number generators are widely used in cryptographic protocols. If the random number generator is compromised, so are the ciphers that use it.”

If Ferrari produced more, they would earn more money. The only reason they don’t is because it’s tacky to produce more of a limited edition car.

There is no limit on how many of those things can be produced. Water can be filtered, non-arable land can be turned into arable land. Human labour can produce pretty much anything. There will never be more than 21m bitcoin, by design.

From what I understand LN solves the scaling issues for now and the network isn’t close to running into the limit of scaling that LN provides. There’s nothing stopping a third layer solution if it’s needed. Also, it’s important to improve privacy before scaling, which is why they’re focusing on that now.

“According to Marxist theory, in capitalist societies, class conflict arises due to contradictions between the material interests of the oppressed and exploited proletariat—a class of wage labourers employed to produce goods and services—and the bourgeoisie—the ruling class that owns the means of production and extracts its wealth through appropriation of the surplus product produced by the proletariat in the form of profit.”

Every time bitcoin breaks through a dollar power of ten, it crashes. $1, $10, $100, $1000, $10,000. The dollar is the global currency. People think in terms of powers of ten. If you live in a world where bitcoin has only ever been worth hundreds of dollars, then suddenly it’s worth a thousand, it looks expensive and overvalued, so you sell. That’s what caused that crash and every other bitcoin crash. It will happen at $100,000 and again at $1,000,000.

Tbh I think the halvings are built into the price already. But yes I think bitcoin is even more scarce because no matter what happens to the price, the mining rate is fixed. With gold, when the price goes up, the incentive for mining goes up and it's mined at a higher rate. This makes bitcoin the hardest currency in history.

Everything is only ever worth what people are willing to pay for it. Even after Modi outlawed the 500 rupee bill it still retained 70% of its value for a few months because people kept accepting it - even after its underlying “promise” from the government ceased to exist.
I don’t know what the exact value will be but I know it’ll be a lot higher than now. 
Gold is held in safes due to its scarcity, nothing more. It’s a store of value because of its scarcity. As soon as it’s used in industrial processes it stops being a store of value.
The volatility of bitcoin is due to its size. When bitcoin is a truly global decentralised store of value/payment network, it will be big enough that it won’t have these daily fluctuations.

With stocks, you’re betting at a casino. Maybe a product will succeed, maybe a CEO will do a good job.
With bitcoin, the thing you’re buying stays exactly the same. It is as scarce as it’s ever been and ever will be. With bitcoin, you’re not betting at a casino - you’re betting on humans betting at a casino.
One year there will be 100,000 people at the casino, 4 years later there will be 10 million. But humans are similar enough - the crowd will make the same bet each time. The pattern is repeating.
