free markets are conducive to monopolies... but, monopoly is bad for mining.. it's a terrible trap, because a state (china) is the monopolists in this case. not sure why people are still supporting a non-fungible network like bitcoin.. oh well, ASICs are the slow death of an alt network; will become more apparent over time.

apex traders utilize both tactics in our strategy. goes like this - fundamentals (investing), then technicals (trading). technicals are only really valid for support/resistance, and finding a range.. rest of it's fundamentals.

vinny's a confirmed class 1 dipshit; whose opinions should be ignored.

begging for bitcoin? pretty-scummy, imo ...hope you fail
@_date: 2017-04-19 12:31:43
my identity's fine, thanks anyways
@_date: 2017-04-12 11:12:34

FUD can influence any market. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:40:29
no, markets weren’t as liquid as they are today. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:46:52
you’ll be okay. give BTC a little time to find her sea legs, and some build support.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:18:13
nothing dude said’s incorrect. can attest to his statement! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:15:13
“I'm self employed and don't have much use for money”
money sux

fat people lack self control, and shouldn’t be anywhere near a position of power. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:38:14
you forgetting your password (hilarious) doesn’t make kraken a scam. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:01:15
nobody should want this to happen. tell all your friends to buy bitcoin, so john doesn’t need to self mutilate, and cannibalize himself. this is a level 3 emergency. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:21:28
so what? CNY volume’s pretty-close to 0

“bircoin” doesn’t exist.
john has to eat his own dick by default. sad!

random trading advice from normies is my favorite!

yes, censorship resistance, and destroying all forms of socalism.

kid took a risk those people didn’t have the nuts to take, and got paid for his troubles. jealousy is an evil thing!
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:06:30
the whole point of bitcoin's to render socialism unworkable. your future looks a lot more like ancapistan. socialists will be tossed from helicopters. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:41:44
yes, but your friend should be armed
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:37:44
completely enjoyable! nasty corrections bring-out the best memes. trolls seem a little more funny. good times! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:57:09
actually, it’s a fantastic thing when the shoeshine boy’s talking about your new currency.
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:09:59
i won’t be turning off a single worker... will also celebrate earth day by wasting as much electricity as possible. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:39:36
people don’t like seeing others succeed. normies are jealous, sad, and vindictive. working in a cubicle prolly warps their minds after a while.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:45:00
it’s good to have a mix of savers, and spenders. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:40:38
they already use digital currency. also, their currency will still be inflationary dogshit.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:49:10
if you’re in position to do so; hold for minute. patience will be rewarded.    
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:01:37
usually, a country will b&amp; bitcoin because they're feeling insecure about their national currency. take a look @ the countries that've been publicly hostile to BTC, then watch what their currency does afterward. don't risk your money!! just pay attention to yuan in the coming weeks!!
interesting tidbit -  USD's been dominating trade volume for a minute. complete flip-flop with yuan
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:12:30
i’m good with that
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:13:48
to end all forms of socialism

no, but
hal finney, or sunny king are my top guesses.

do you believe UFOs are real, or are they really CIA holograms?
also, you should double down on your short position RIP
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:35:02
might invest in equities after a multiyear correction. really wanted to buy NVDA, but don’t want to pay +$200 for it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:01:21
the bitcoin class of 2012-2013 is the best class. think we already have battle scars.. but a lot newbies haven’t really seen a nasty bear market.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:56:41
if you’re holding 6-11 top alts ...you’re going to have a bad time. should only hold 1, maybe 2... good luck skeeter!

it’s all gambling. point is to analyze a market, and place bets on the direction.

@_date: 2018-02-05 11:43:42
ride it out! no way i’d feel comfortable shorting BTC @ current levels. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 12:32:42
rupee is shitting the bed, and they want to inflate the already shitty currency more. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 13:21:44
snopes can be political in their analysis.
here’s the straight dope. 
it’s a true statement, tho

this is amazing work, good sir.. you have a talent nobody can possibly understand. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:44:57
hold with iron gauntlets! this is the first step toward joining team hoard. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 17:42:48
different reasons, but china specifically is an exporter, so it helps them to have a weaker currency than their trading partners. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:13:56
markets have been rough... people are excited. try r/ personalfinance for a more stuffy experience. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:01:54
the feeling is mutual, bb 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:57:31
no lower than $7,000
keep in mind early AM EST is normally weak. be interesting to see if we start a little recovery as we move towards the afternoon

UBI is so worthless they plan to give it away for free!

really hope you’re short
@_date: 2018-04-15 12:58:00
cash still serves a purpose. cash is the most private form of currency available. also, pretty handy when the power goes out (learned that after a hurricane).

bitcoin, and zcash... my two favorites! great news!!!
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:21:18
why would NSA promote usage of a fully encrypted alt network? make no sense to me! 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:18:48
need to hunt the stops, and shake-out the weak hands before legging-up. great blood dip! 
@_date: 2017-05-20 10:57:33
at current prices; you'll receive much better returns investing in zcash 
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:23:55
professor bitcorn's my favorite! always do the opposite of what he says, and you'll do well in life!

invest in crack houses; buy them with cash; dominate 
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:05:50
called them out on that, and they replied "different writers have different opinions." :::shrugs::: oh well !! go Bitcoin, GO!
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:18:38
they've been telling me this since BTC was @ $6.00 
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:50:18
i didn't read the piece, but the title makes no sense. if the market's just starting a bullish cycle; wouldn't considered a bubble!  
@_date: 2017-05-14 12:48:03
Will read! 
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:25:55
if le pen wins the french elections; absolute possibility! go le pen, GO!
if no le pen - (imo) we'll finish in the $1575-1600 range ...really be a good thing to build support at these levels.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:03:23
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:47:42
yes ...when you're buying an alt via BTC; you're basically shorting BTC, and long your alt.
since you're already shorting your national currency via purchasing BTC; you're (in a way) short BTC, and fiat! 
@_date: 2017-05-01 11:40:02
we have changed the world; good feels! you prolly wouldn't know anything about that, tho.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:42:45
bitcoin just needed to haze the newbs
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:07:25
don't get me wrong, here ...i'm pro money laundering, but hope you, and your family practice coin-control! bitcoin's block chain is an open ledger. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:23:59
no, you're confusing BTC with IMF's SDR. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:39:39
instead of mixing; why wouldn't i just use zcash as a pass- though?
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:34:09
been thinking about this ...why not build a mixing service that uses zcash as a pass-through in an automated fashion. imagine this will be possible when XCAT is available.
(not poo-pooing your service, BTW. i'm pro-fungibility projects!)

millibit works fine, thanks for your input.
