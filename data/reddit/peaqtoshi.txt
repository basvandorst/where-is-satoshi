I dont have a lightning or BTC node at the moment, do I need one if I want to use a non custodial wallet?

Wow thanks, it is my first lightning transaction, it feels really good!

What I meant with my comment is that with Bitcoin no one can take control of your money and charge you 5$ because you don't agree with their rules

Yes, but that balance doesn't have any meaning if you can't trace it back to a person (owner), and wallets help you on this (such as Wasabi wallet)

WTF are you talking about? This is not related to the discussion at all, I seriously doubt you understand any of these topics

What does it share? There are already several wallets that enable private transactions with Bitcoin, so you dont disclose your account balance
@_date: 2019-02-19 18:33:36
Still... you dont know what you are talking about

Yes and No... currently you do have to expose your info when you purchase BTC, but after the purchase you are able to transfer that BTC anywhere, and using methods like Mimble Wimble you would be able to protect the privacy of the final destination address, in addition, we are hoping that in the future we are able to buy BTC from Decentralized exchanges that will hopefully not require KYC, but that is just a desire, it is not implemented yet.

I hope every bank starts doing this,I am pretty sure  people would move their money out of banks and into Bitcoin, they would finally understand the benefits of this network!
