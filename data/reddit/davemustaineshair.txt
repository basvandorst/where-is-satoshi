Couldn't said thieves just buy monero and vanish the trail?

Dude that's weird, get your money out for sure then... Have you tried Gemini? I haven't, but I hear nothing but good. Many say it's superior to coinbase.... I think it's the exchange started by those winklevoss twins.

I had thoughts on this yesterday. Maybe everything thing is just iou's. As in no actual coins ever exist. Which in one hand, means they can never be hacked for their coins (because they don't have any). But on the other hand ours problematic if they don't have the liquidity to pay out if the the prices explode.

Keep in mind net neutrality has only been here since 2014. It was barley a blip in the internet, nothing had changed when it came and nothing is changing without it.

Convert to monero or verge first

This is fucking awesome. I don't like her music or anything about her other than the rack, but this will get crypto into all her fans minds...

Holy shnikeys, 400 million? The biggest theft in the history of the world? Smh, these exchanges need to get their shit together. At the same time, I'm thinking inside job. Also people need to start using cold storage.

Yeah, I'm underwater too, best thing to do is buy more at the dips to lower your average buy in price. It sucks if you're out of investment capital, but when the price recovers (and I'm sure it will, although I have no proof) you'll be even better off. I bought some at 10k than 17k then 9.5k. So I'm roughly in the same boat.

What was their reasoning behind this?
Did you get your money out?

The comment section of the article is hilarious! Wow! How dumb they all were just two years ago.

I don't know about this zeitgeist fellow, but I know history and I know people. People go to war over money and resources everyday since the beginning of time. There's never gonna be some new magic currency tat changes any of that.

I did... Hope it's the right move

No more moon from btc. Still good, but I think the only lambos are gonna come from alt coins. If you pick the right one early.

It's called human nature... No matter what you call it, decentralized, p2p, it's still money. Humans are greedy and awful at heart and nothing will ever change that. It's hardwired in.

That's exactly where I'm at... CC maxed, waiting for pending funds... Should we wait for another dip or just jump in?
