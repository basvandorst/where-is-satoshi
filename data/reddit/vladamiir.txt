Yah like Jesus that was sad
@_date: 2019-07-15 05:08:12
If I was Dad I'd honestly surprise him get him just Bitcoin but $500 worth in a wallet somewhere.  He'd be so amazed not expecting that at all. $500 in BTC for him I can see his joy now, like I bet he'd cry and Dad knows it'll grow :P
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:22:52
Hey your in that's what counts
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:27:08
Cant believe I'm here right now.  College student who bought at 3.5k in January.
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:23:58
Yah I was terrified it would drop lower, but the media and sentiment told me to buy.
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:27:47
@_date: 2019-07-10 04:36:50
Well for me it would've been the difference of getting one or not getting one.  I was able to time it with my savings and tax return so I still could pay Spring tuition.  If I had waited I wouldn't have had enough after paying Spring tuition to get it.
@_date: 2019-03-15 04:44:13
Tell em buy now why low :P
@_date: 2019-03-15 04:38:42
I needed this, the fud almost was gettin to me
@_date: 2019-08-17 04:45:23
Good to know
@_date: 2019-08-16 05:08:42
Well that makes a lot more since now, Xapo seemed awesome I had wondered why they suddenly migrated over.
@_date: 2019-08-30 20:08:29
I haven't used either but am surprised as Ledger UI stuff looks extremely clean and minimal.  Maybe its the color scheme difference.
@_date: 2019-08-20 19:32:51
I bought a Bitcoin back in January of this year.
@_date: 2019-08-19 23:18:06
Have they said anything like that, having a premium.
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:42:55
Will people be able to move from Coinbase to Bakkt, or is Bakkt only going to be for those with like 100+ Bitcoins?
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:41:07
I got mine at $3600 back in January,  no complaints here :)
@_date: 2019-08-17 02:38:13
omg that was so funny, she said NOOOOOOOO
@_date: 2019-08-17 02:21:58
So if this happened in the US, would gold skyrocket to $100,000+ to the dollar, or whatever the "Gold" ticker on. news sites is representing.
@_date: 2019-08-16 22:08:59
With that little honestly its something you'd want to forget about and stumble on in a few years.
@_date: 2019-08-26 02:54:50
Is this photoshopped, I knew it was in the movie, but "intro into futures market" that's scary creepy considering Bakkt launching...but no one knew that
@_date: 2019-08-16 04:27:23
Interesting, a few weeks ago GBTC actually migrated their custody to Coinbase's Intuitional offerings.
@_date: 2019-08-16 22:07:16
Do you have those other coins already? If so I would just increase holdings of all of them each or add to your BTC.
@_date: 2019-08-30 14:25:55
I gotta say 1 feels really solid
@_date: 2019-10-07 15:15:19
So sold some BTC to buy the new iPhone and Watch, a week later I’m returning both to buy more BTC ��
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:40:05
Look I know HODL and all but I am upset I didn't sell this summer and buy back now and even come December.  At this rate why wouldn't we dip down 6 or even 5k.
@_date: 2019-10-09 01:59:57
Just topped off my portfolio, let’s just say I got my ticket ��
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:28:00
Mood tho
@_date: 2019-10-07 15:54:47
Way to rub it in ��������
@_date: 2019-10-26 05:36:09
Same situation today, fomo got me. as it crossed 10k.  now I'm back in and down $500.
@_date: 2019-10-09 03:10:54
They kinda act like jerks, when he had a great explanation...I feel bad.
@_date: 2019-08-19 18:33:30
Anyone just waiting to see it go right back down?  The last few weeks have certainly made me pessimistic about upward price swings.
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:52:45
I am confused on what Bakkt is launching? Is this a institutional competitor to Coinbase institutional services?
@_date: 2019-10-08 19:38:30
South, I want to buy more.
@_date: 2019-10-08 17:12:42
I use Coinbase with 2 factor through Microsoft Auth app.  Secure and Simple.
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:39:08
Good to know
@_date: 2019-04-16 01:43:39
$500 deposit limit... do they at least transfer the money faster?
@_date: 2019-12-06 05:27:06
So wait before I buy .25 more of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-20 19:32:58
Anyone use Circle Invest? I’m in the process of leaving Coinbase.  Any recommendations that utilize ach transfers from banks (Charles Schwab in my case) ?
@_date: 2019-04-07 03:27:11
The effect is greatly diminished when investing that small amount into BTC.  
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:03:03
Im considering investing into GBTC, the Bitcoin Trust.  My question is, if an ETF gets approved, does that render the trust worthless since people could just purchase Bitcoin through the ETF?
@_date: 2019-04-17 02:19:08
I looked at the price like 10 minutes later and regretted the comment
@_date: 2019-04-07 03:25:06
Ohhhhhh :)
@_date: 2019-04-16 20:32:42
Its not an opinion piece either, I'm surprised to say the least.
@_date: 2019-04-16 01:10:15
“Grayscale Bitcoin Trust” it’s a stock/security that allows you to expose yourself to BTC in a traditional investment or brokerage account.  1 share holds ~1/1000 of an actual Bitcoin and then you pay a premium on top.  Much more convenient for some people then dealing with other exchanges.
@_date: 2019-04-06 16:17:47
thanks for the clarity
@_date: 2019-04-05 21:50:11
How do you effectively dollar cost average into Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-04-17 11:44:34
Bruh so serious and I’m waiting a lot longer then 10 days for this.  Millionaire at age 20 if McAfee ends up being right :P
@_date: 2019-04-08 01:38:55
My parents told me to cash out after I told them I have enough for next semesters tuition.  My job income will handle that, and then reimburse it , meanwhile my BTC will continue to increase in value :) 
@_date: 2019-04-15 23:28:27
GBTC gonna end up giving us the value of two for the price of the one eventually �� getting in now while I can afford it.  ��
@_date: 2019-04-07 02:05:11
 Im a functional adult at 18 years old :P 
@_date: 2019-04-16 14:48:12
When Bitcoin goes up substantially it drives up the premium that GBTC has, during the last bull run the premium was 100% ��
@_date: 2019-04-16 18:50:58
These pumps with no follow through are so depressing ��
@_date: 2019-04-12 22:50:53
Already did, today it won't close my account for some reason, I've dm'd them.
@_date: 2019-04-15 02:29:02
Sub 3.5k went to 3.2k a week later :/ then a two months and bam 5k
@_date: 2019-04-12 03:26:04
Yah I'm gonna move my holdings over, its a lot simpler because my brokerage account/checking is all under Charles Schwab.  Should also see a nice discount tomorrow once trading opens.
@_date: 2019-04-08 12:25:37
Seemed like maximalists always got sh*t for the misconceptions this posts mentions. 
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:59:15
Im failing to see a benefit to investing in the Bitcoin Trust vs Bitcoin itself.  Am I missing something?  
@_date: 2019-04-18 05:29:08
Time for a new bank, may I suggest Charles Schwab
@_date: 2019-04-07 23:56:56
Cash app in USA
@_date: 2019-04-16 17:53:54
Duh payday is Friday ��
@_date: 2019-04-16 17:37:53
too late broke college student reporting his FOMO :(
@_date: 2019-04-17 18:59:42
Oh damn I didn’t know anyone could go post on Forbes like that.
@_date: 2019-04-15 19:51:15
Buying GBTC on the way down, feels good :)
@_date: 2019-04-07 00:59:02
I mean I could argue the same thing with Coinbase, Cash App, or Gemini
@_date: 2019-04-08 01:30:58
Great post, I don't feel bad saying I'm a maximalist now 
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:15:02
I did this evening at $6450 after their fee, jokes on them :)
@_date: 2019-05-08 19:32:34
Gemini is returning my wire because I messed up the info, will the money just go back into my bank account that the wire came from?
@_date: 2019-05-08 19:54:58
Idk ��
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:15:05
My bank doesn’t charge any incoming wire fees.  Only outgoing and they would probably reimburse it if I asked since the wire failed.  My bank customer service is astoundingly amazing.
@_date: 2019-05-10 21:04:18
So I finally got my botched wire back, but now I can't wire till Monday :(  Anyone have a better way to buy 1 Bitcoin today?
@_date: 2019-05-10 21:11:50
Tempting but no
