Oh look another "but people hoard bitcoins. No one spends them" argument... I'm starting to believe glasses man is doing this purposefully.
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:34:35
you're best bet would have been to contact gyft. Ive had the same bad experiences. Gyft refunded me the bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-05 01:50:28
I'd be interested in voice overs!
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:36:53
well if they're selling bitcoin... that means someones buying bitcoin. Bitpay even pays some of its employees in bitcoin. Soon more and more companies will start being able to pay their own employees using a bitpay payroll api. bitcoin for everyone!

I sent them an email and they responded same day!

i want to use something that makes me completely sure I'm secure. I look at the market and laugh because if the market tanks...that just means more bit coins ill be able to buy. Im looking to safely secure my bitcoins most importantly. I like the windows xp idea! any other recommendations to armory?

squarespace is getting ddos today...so updating it doesn't seem to work at the moment...but stay tuned I'll have something up tonight haha!
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:45:30
Yeah I realize that. We're working on our business proposal and definitely looking for a team to help build our site. It's all a work in progress. We just felt that it would be best to start establishing our name and what we want to accomplish
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:34:28
will do! keep in touch through the website! it will be updated daily!
@_date: 2013-11-16 03:21:38
i love his videos! definitely will link him up
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:17:13
 
Our area on coinmap. We feel that we can have a significant impact in our local area. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 19:43:46
i think its a good thing because right now block chain isn't the most user friendly. I think with acquiring zero block, they aim to update their look and feel. make it as appealing as zero block is. I think this is going to work out well for them
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:11:46
I think we are more than just a simple service of helping businesses accept bitcoin. We want to help showcase businesses on our website which will attract more business for them. I think that eventually bitcoin will blow up so much that every business will want to accept bitcoin. By then I think people will be willing to pay for our service and will rely on our reputation. 
Definitely appreciate the feedback! Because you are right. Even though our main goal is to further the bitcoin economy, we still want to make some money to support ourselves. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:18:36
thanks for the clarification!
@_date: 2013-11-16 03:09:20
I should have mentioned that. Im still working on my delivery on how to properly explain bit coin. But everyday I'm learning more and more. I will definitely remember this for next time i encounter some bit coin doubters
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:07:31
seems like bologna
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:13:34
We all know coinbase is  Does snapchat really have the cash flow that coinbase does? Nope.
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:37:50
that would be a hilarious series to watch.
@_date: 2013-12-17 07:50:06
it seems to have stopped. Yeah its real check their twitter! follow us on twitter too if you have one and share it, were really trying to build an internet presence and get a movement going!
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:01:23
i can see it now!
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:52:47
Fair enough... We shall be back with new partners and a better website. Stay tuned gentlemen. We are not going anywhere.
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:47:39
At this point. We're doing it for free. We really want to establish a relationship with these businesses so that they come to us for assistance when new technologies arise in the bitcoin world. Eventually we will have a nice site where we will offer advertising space on it and provide quality photos of their establishment maybe even video of it if they choose. But we will offer various services that will attract businesses to us  (edit- this account is also my personal bitcoin account. Which I will use intermittently to communicate)
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:39:55
Oh this video brought a smile to my face. Reminds me of myself when trying to explain bit coin to people who have no clue...
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:54:58
haha unfortunately not as early as id wish...
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:51:06
I don't think that's necessary. We are new to this but are willing to learn. The website is always going to be developed and is easy enough to maintain and customize. I think for now hiring a professional is not necessary. I feel we are capable enough in doing it ourselves. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:44:31
elaborate! what chart do you use?

the rest of the see more section... didn't notice i had not included it
 - the finale
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:44:35
so turns out my boss already knew about bit coin... he said convincing our accounting department would be tough...that they would laugh at him. bunch of old fucks in there....
@_date: 2013-11-11 11:23:25
yeah I definitely understand the importance of not using it online at all, other than bit coin transactions of course. crucial for security
@_date: 2013-11-11 10:51:50
i was just thinking the same thing! i need to learn how to make a secure wallet first though... you could even sell bit coins to friends !
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:43:58
Oh these are prototypes ! Thus the black and white. Youre the first person to mention the font... What would you recommend?
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:28:23
would love to have you on the team! check out 
squarespace seems to be being attacked...which is knocking down my website :(
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:39:01
But i think the internet is more open to different choices! I think the internet is usually right on most things! sure it can be open to manipulation but for the most part the brightest ideas shine!
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:36:53
Really thats awesome! How does it work though? Is it an actual cryptocurrency? I was thinking more so just to use the block chain as the service to build the service on top of
@_date: 2013-11-10 03:30:29
do they need to be in my coin base account before i can transfer them to a paper wallet
and should i be offline to generate the paper wallet from coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:52:14
thats not quite what i said
edit - looked at your comment history. i am honored you took the time to diss me
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:48:21
when is sundance?? id love to book travel on cheap air!
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:57:56
seems legit.
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:03:04
David You need to get back on the rogan podcast and drop some knowledge on bit coin!
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:59:13
Definitely. At the moment we are working on our pitch and business plan.  Short term goal for us is to get one business to accept bitcoin. Once we do that I think we can get the ball rolling. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:29:02
We're actually the only ferry service around! Very little competition. But we are very well known in the Southern California area!
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:24:49
i don't think the government is as evil as you think.... i think bit coin gives everyone the opportunity to succeed. I think once the united states realizes the potential for bit coin that it truly will change the way they interact with the world and individuals with full transparency
@_date: 2013-11-15 06:36:56
I'm going to do my best to take in the facts and come to a reasonable decision. I will make sure to voice my opinion to the public. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:58:57
It all makes sense now. Where is this from?
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:27:58
I think the best way to vote is online. You vote online everyday by the sites  you chose to visit. Everyday is a vote for humanity.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:34:02
I think the government would have no choice but to use it. If the American government wants to remain a world leader in technology it has to adapt. It has to.
