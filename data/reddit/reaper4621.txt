You may think honest money is purely a social problem, but it's not. It's also a huge source of pain for businesses, which have come to love the ease of obtaining profits from customers, customers with whom VISA acts as a facilitator for paying with IOUs.
For most business owners, VISA is acting as a very reliable loan shark that gets people to cough up the money consistently *enough* at the end of the month to make accepting credit cards worth it. Some people charge back, other people don't pay. ID theft is a problem. But the present reality - and there isn't any indication this will change for the better - demands business owners accept IOUs.
Bitcoin is antithetical to credit systems, which are never going to go away so long as humans have the impulse to buy things now and pay for them later. So long as people would rather not take on the pain of paying for things in the present moment, the market will demand VISA.
I'm not sure how Bitcoin reconciles with this. Credit systems are possible to do on top of Bitcoin, maybe with USDCoin or maybe something else, but BTC payments are final, and no synthetic substitute for BTC will ever compare to payments in raw BTC which is much more comparable to cash than credit.
Just my 2c.

edit: I posit some people like using credit cards because it is perceived to be more "secure" than cash, as in the ability to do chargebacks and not get mugged for all you're worth is highly highly important. This is a problem Bitcoin can solve, but I don't see how BTC can solve the buy-now pay-later problem.

**Key component  normalize the use of storage of BTC in 2 of 3 multisig addresses.**
This solves the violent mugging problem cash has while still giving merchants the finality of BTC payments.
**Key component  normalize the use of multisig in all BTC payments.**
This creates an implicit money back guarantee on all purchases, i.e. calling up your payment processor and explaining you were scammed can get you your money back within 30 days regardless of the merchant you're buying from.
It's on BitPay and Coinbase to normalize this style of payment, and I'm sure they'll do it because it's a technically impressive feature and can add to their bottom line since they can skim an extra % off the top of payments running through their platform while still offering this to merchants as a choice.
The hardest problem is supporting ubiquitous multisig payments in open source wallets, but that is better handled by projects like OpenBazaar, which could compete somewhat with Coinbase/BitPay.
