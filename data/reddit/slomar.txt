Bitsquare.io. Not a lot of users on it, so it can be difficult to find a trading partner. I've used it for about four or five transactions now with clearxchange as the payment method... But they support others as well. It does require a little over .03 btc as a security deposit for transactions though. I seeded my wallet with a bitcoin atm to get started.

Where does the trezor ship from? I see it's backordered right now, but the DHL shipping is a bit pricey and the standard says 5 day to 6 weeks depending on location.

But gemini wants you to enter in your login credentials for your bank and has no deposit verification style option... why would anyone think it's a good idea to provide your bank credentials to a third-party site?

I've been playing poker on nitrogensports.eu based on another reddit thread on this topic. Not bad.

Trezor, ledger nano s, or keepkey are the current market leaders. I have the nano s. Many work with electrum. The difference being that your private key is never exposed on your computer thereby reducing/eliminating your risk of malware or keyloggers stealing your wallet or private keys. Anytime you want to send coin, you have to physically confirm on the hardware wallet which is in effect signing the transaction on the hardware wallet and keeping those private keys off the computer. Also, it will not expose your seed word on your computer when the wallet is created... Assuming you don't make the mistake of storing your seed word on your computer or ever typing it on there, etc.

The authenticator plus file is already 256 bit encrypted from the app by default.  I'm in agreement with you... Have to understand all the potential weak links and assess your own level of risk vs convenience. I just don't like the Google app because if you factory reset your phone, you have to set everything back up.

Roxio Toast of course.

Using 2FA on the Dropbox, so you can have backup codes just for that or sms as a backup (which a lot of sites require with an app anyway)... Or go back to a computer that is already a trusted browser.  Plus, if you are backing up your computer, then the file is getting stored on another disk. File is encrypted. I realize one could argue using Dropbox is marginally less secure, but you'd have to hack Dropbox and decrypt the file... And then also know the password for the account as well. Risk is there but, depending where you'd be storing the qr code screenshots... Potentially still less of a risk.

I always recommend Authenticator Plus. Can backup a file to Dropbox (or locally).

If only it didn't cost so much to move my btc from legacy to segwit.

Can't panic sell if your transactions are stuck in the mempool with 175k others. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 13:37:59
But they don't support deposit verification for a bank account and require you to enter in the login credentials for your bank's site. That should never be an acceptable solution.

I had a ton of issues with Coinbase before I got a working account. I made most of my purchases on bitsquare.io but sometimes finding a seller isn't immediate. You also need a small amount of btc already to make transactions which I seeded my wallet from an atm to get started. On the plus side, if your bank account supports clearxchange, you only have to provide an email address or phone number to make a transaction. 
Also, I haven't used this site, but would consider it as well.

The whole point of the ledger is that it keeps your private key and seed word off your computer. If you have a key logger hiding on your computer and you type your seed word to encrypt it... Boom... Ledger compromised. That's the same weak link of using a software wallet. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:29:57
I have a full copy of the seed word as well. The halves are just offsite backups in the event the primary fails. If you're typing your seed word on your computer to encrypt it, you're completely defeating the purpose of having a ledger. And while you may say I can do that on an air gapped computer which won't be connected to the internet... I'd say, if I had that option I wouldn't need the ledger.

Make a copy, cut it in half. Store each half with two people you trust as a backup option. Then have your own full set somewhere else safe.
Edit: for clarity, I made the copy of the blank card that was provided and rewrote everything by hand since my printer / scanner is on a network.

So, I guess Fortune 500 companies don't do business in countries with volatile local currency? You can protect against volatility... It's called hedging. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:45:22
Well, we can get into theoreticals all day... If that was a legitimate concern for someone, a key logger is a much more probable scenario. All of which could be avoided by transcribing your seed word by hand and figuring out a means to safely store it in more than one location.
Edit: the idea is not to eliminate every risk, that's impossible. It's about reducing it as much as possible. My method obviously has physical risks versus digital ones.

Sure... But they are a retail company, not a hedge fund. And my understanding is that they are basically hodling half of the crypto they receive in sales... Not actively purchasing crypto. Therefore, if they price people out of buying anything on their site...they aren't really receiving any significant amount of crypto. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:08:23
No... You have to do it on an air gapped computer not connected to the network. Then you'd have to wipe the OS / disk before reconnecting it to the network in case a key logger was recording data in the background to transmit on reconnection to the network. Point being, if you have a spare computer to use for that purpose, you could create a wallet offline and use it for signing transactions. Then you wouldn't need a ledger.

I was looking forward to making some purchases there with crypto until I realized all the items I wanted are priced at least 20% higher than every other retail site.

You can restore to a software wallet with the seed word if you had to.

He went to Coinbase.
