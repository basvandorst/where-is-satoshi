Well I'm still pretty lost so hopefully somebody can help me out her with some questions.
1. I thought one of the purposes of Bitcoin was to do away with banks, yet that very service is offered to store your bitcoins which I thought was secure in the first place?  If I download a bitcoin wallet on my phone would my bitcoins not be secure?
2. Bitcoin is supposed to be unstoppable. If I want to pay John Doe for something I can and nobody can do anything about it. Well what if a miner never decides to approve it or work it into a blockchain? Am I just stuck at that point? Does my transaction never go through? If it does go through then whats the point of a miner?
3. Also I still don't understand what a miner does or how they operate. Please ELI5 
4. The word node is mentioned a lot. What is that? What does it do or mean?

So what's to stop a huge group of people or most miners deciding they all want higher transaction fees to do stuff? And through that limiting what you can and can't do with your bitcoin? What if I don't want to pay a higher transaction fee? 
I'm just having a hard time understanding how the premise of the whole idea is to give you financial freedom to spend your money whenever and wherever. If it's run by people it seems like it could eventually be manipulated by people

I thought there weren't supposed to be any transaction fees? Can anybody with a computer become a miner? How do you become a miner?
