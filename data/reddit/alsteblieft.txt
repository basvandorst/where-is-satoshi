Is it still benificial to use the .onion link if the bitcoins will be send from my phone over the clearnet? Only the receiving wallet communicates via TOR.

bitmixer.io seems easy and fast and from what I've read pretty trustworthy. I can just forward my bitcoins from one wallet through the bitcoin mixer to another.

Thank you, your answers have been very helpful to get a better understanding of the process.
I will simply be using the clearnet site, sending bitcoins from my copay wallet, running them through the bitmixer and receiving them on my wallet that only connects over TOR should give me enough privacy and hide my IP and location, which is my goal.
I suppose I could make an extra wallet that only connects over TOR, send the bitcoins from my copay wallet to that wallet first, then run them through the mixer and receive them on a third wallet that connects over TOR. But the first method seems sufficient enough.

One wallet is on my phone, Copay to be precise. The other is on my computer, Electrum connected via Tor.
I can't send bitcoins to the .onion link from my phone's wallet since it's not connected to the TOR network and I don't think Copay supports this anyway. 
But I can receive the bitcoins from the clearnet bitmixer site to my wallet on my computer that's connected via TOR?
Did I understand this correctly? Or do all connections need to be over TOR?

yes, that's my current wallet setup on linux. What about bitcoin mixers, is bitmixer.io a good choice?
