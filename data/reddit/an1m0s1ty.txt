i wouldn't see how a GST tax would be applicable since it's likely to be placed in the same category as a forex transaction - you don't pay 10% GST for that

You're probably right, but the frequency with which they flood the frontpage genuinely drowns out topics which deserve more attention than a circlejerk about "how much money we're making".
Once every now and then is (sort of) understandable but most people already know about the price before it gets a thread on reddit

No, I can't memorise that many words and I'm skeptical of leaving it saved somewhere on my computer.

I bought one about an hour ago.
We wait for the little rig to arrive, and then we start mining.
Pools are readily available all over the web but you dont need to worry about that until your little SC Arrives - which will not be for a few months in all likelihood.

Fuck yeah there is man.
Bank -&gt; Mt. Gox -&gt; BTC -&gt; Wallet.
you'll pay approx 9% in fees.

I certainly do!
I mean, i've only got 5btc in my wallet but i had a freakout about the possibility. So the chance really is infathomably small - all that I care about. Thanks!

Yes and no - I totally understand people's excitement but when we get 20 threads about the same price, and then another 20 about a $10 increase, it's frustrating. If it was a single thread for each 50/100,  i probably wouldn't be so perturbed

i cant even make sense of this first paragraph. please use punctuation
@_date: 2013-03-18 07:36:59
Thanks for such an incredibly poignant response. The question was also answered before you posted it, absolutely rendering it even more pointless.

yeah you'll usually need to register a username/password with your details, and type these into the mining program. then when your miner starts doin it's thing, it'll automatically register with the pool

unless they remove the ability to withdraw funds from accounts a la Cyprus, they're powerless to prevent it.....

you'd be insane to buy an ASIC from BFL when they haven't even got a single chip working at its correct power requirement

yeah you'll need a pool. the rate is distributed evenly between all pool members. as a group, you'll hit more blocks and get more bonuses, meaning more BTC.
don't expect to have made your money back for at least a couple months after it arrives though... most likely longer
