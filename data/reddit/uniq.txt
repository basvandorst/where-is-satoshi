Maybe I'm late for the thread, but:
* Not making all the system depend on the shitload of energy required for mining
I know that with renewable energy sources it should not be a problem, but currently our energy comes from fossil fuels, and we are literally burning them in large amounts just bruteforcing bitcoin blocks.
I know that this is the core of the blockchain and cannot be changed, but it's still stupid the idea of spending a lot of resources just doing dumb calculations.
You know, we could invest all these calculations on decoding DNA or finding new stable molecules.

Well, I have to confess that I'm very out of the alternative to Bitcoin scene, so I'm not very interested on debating or anything. My comment was just that, a comment.
And well, I didn't know about that rule (yeah, I'm here just for the big news). I think is a very stupid rule.

Newbie here
As I understood, the problem in Greece is that the country needs money to pay for public services (healthcare, retirements, unemployment...), so the country is asking for a credit, but they don't like the conditions (and they can't pay their debts too).
How Bitcoin can fix the problem here?

Short term fluctuations allows you to collect more BTC, and if you have more BTC, you will have a bigger increment in the long term.
If BTC is at 100 USD/BTC and in the future at 1,000 USD/BTC:
* If you buy 10 BTC today, in the future you will have 10,000 USD in the future.
* If you buy 10 BTC and you increment it to 11 BTC trading in short term price fluctuations, you will have 11,000 USD in the future.
Short term price fluctuations are important too.

Woah, I was just kidding with the famous [nigerian scam]( 
When I see *Africa* and *money* at the same context, the nigerian scam is what pops in my mind.
What the fuck, reddit, what the fuck...
