3.2.1 Going to pick up my moon suit from the cleaners. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:56:55
Anybody else got a feeling as soon as this Gox thing blows over btc is going to the moon?
@_date: 2014-06-11 13:26:59
If you accept it...they will come
@_date: 2014-01-30 17:00:28
The buy orders that are coming in are gross. I'm really curious to see where this goes from here. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 05:45:32
Next I'll be buy my Steelers tickets with Bitcoin! Can't wait for that day.

I'd hait to see you on your first date 
@_date: 2014-02-03 11:32:17
Where's the 2FA options?
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:42:09
Based off what appears to be incompetence on behalf of the people running the auction, I'm surprised the coins haven't been stolen yet
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:52:03
What an ass clown. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:43:01
If you have a vested interest in bitcoin you must stop using Gox or the community will have more damage control in the future. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:44:33
There are quit a few clueless people out there 
@_date: 2014-07-25 01:25:13
Smart move 
@_date: 2014-07-19 17:38:44
I still have the old iOS wallet and generally love blockchain, but its been quite some time since apple opened the flood gates. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:05:39
Seriously, what did you think was going to happen when you ask for a hand-out on a internet message board for insert reason here. This is global; not your 1 trick town where people give a shit about your well-being. Last time I checked there are more than 7 billion people on the planet and ironically going on a 7 paragraph rant on how we are all assholes for not give you money is not an efficient or effective way to accomplish your goal. Frankly, it makes you sound delusional. I am firm believer that people who end up in bad situations have made horrible decisions in life 99% of the time. I hate to put it so bluntly but fix your $ucking attitude and maybe some more-generous-soul-than-me will throw you a bone.

Yahoo was in front of google on this one?! But the real question is which one will be first to create a bitcoin wallet or a functional product?

If Gox is sticking around (just threw up in mouth) they need to hire Andreas to un fuck this.

Great hire. He's the poster boy for bitcoiners. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:24:35
One would expect an article on Mt. Gox that's placed on the cover of a very prominent paper to be full of FUD, but no.  Tells me more people are starting to get it. How long before this wave becomes investors and users? 
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:27:05
...really? 
You're going to tell me its fine if I don't give you my money?!?! Isn't that what your 7 paragraph post is about? 
@_date: 2014-04-15 07:15:34
Get your moon suit out of the dry cleaners

Don't be gullible, the GOX coins were stolen by GOX
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:44:54
Who's next? Any bets?
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:28:15
It was a small amount. Less than 1 btc
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:58:44
Mr Cohen, 
How about you start logically and incorporate Bitcoin into the Google-sphere somehow. Be on the forefront of this movement called financial freedom. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:28:54
It's the best way that I have found to buy coins from the US hands down.
@_date: 2014-06-14 23:10:30
Some people were worried for nothing. Who did they think was going to buy them, some schmuck? Come on

All I saw:
"Hello Ass Clown,
I took time out of my day to read your WSJ article.
We are all now dumber and I award you no points.
Journalists like you are bitcoin's biggest problem..."
Where's the fucking bold button 
@_date: 2014-04-11 22:35:05
Zoom out and look big picture. The 4-5 month slip is natural. If you could somehow put a dollar sign on the value of the Internet in a historical graph it wouldn't be all sunshine and roses either. But if you zoomed out it you would see it landed on the moon. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:11:52
And make sure everyone gets a participation trophy. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 01:22:26
You must be the type of person who screams bomb on a plane and wonders why they get rolled up on. SMH

Calling bullshit. "Long term growth is caused by a stable price" is a complete contradiction.
@_date: 2014-07-01 01:28:41
Who are you and why did you bid that number?
@_date: 2014-07-12 00:41:22

Don't worry it won't last too much longer. A big push higher should be brewing again. Then they can call it ponzi scheme again. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:20:46
Bitcoin can't talk, but if it could I'm pretty sure it would say shut the $uck up. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:22:02
How many times can the same piece of news create FUD? This must be a record.

No, it's a blip on the growth curve that's ready to explode up again.
@_date: 2014-01-25 16:19:19
When you zoom out in 15 yrs the vertical portion will be significantly larger than 1 month

NO WAY! What could be better than Satoshi resurrecting himself to completely own Newsweek and make a mockery of their "story of the year" in 1 simple sentence. This saga has me on the edge of my seat. This may be the bitcoin community's finest moment yet! Goosebumps
@_date: 2014-06-20 18:38:38
Gross and inaccurate simplification. Two-bit's take on the sitch is probably true:

You are watching the creation of an ecosystem in front of your eyes. Don't be impatient and don't be scared of the falling price. Your reward for being brave and a visionary will come.

Max out the buy orders
@_date: 2014-02-05 08:19:15

Why do you presume to know mt gox's potential to raise capital and assume that it needs to. You know what happens if you assume...
