So your stance is the government should be involved in some places, but not in the places you don’t think it should be involved in?
Congrats, you’re the same as everyone else. Not a libertarian

Ahh. There’s that participation trophy snowflake individualism that makes libertarianism so mature and workable.
Atta boy. You’re special and valid because YOU’RE YOU.
Mummy’s special little guy and there’s no one more important, special, or unique :)
Warms the heart haha. 
It’s also cute that you think beliefs are the same as “liking something”
TIL that political ideologies and values are really just tastes 
I like chocolate, coffee, cotton T-shirt’s, and this sort of state with these sorts of laws
(One of these things is not like the other)
Keep defining your own truth my narcissistic friend. We will keep the lights on in the real world 
Edit: nvm, I realize you’re just a young student. I suppose we all experiment with dumb shit when we’re in school.
“I paid my own money for it so I can do whatever I want and you must celebrate and tolerate me because the free choices of free individuals are 100% BEYOND REPROACH”
Too cute.

It seems like libertarianism is more of a philosophical circlejerk with no real merit in discussions of real world running of government.

How embarrassingly empty, vague, and non-commital

I mean...yea?
I’m not a full vegetarian, but I like some of their ideas.
I’m not a full pornstar, but I like some of their ideas.
I’m not a full Japanese, but I like some of their ideas 
One can say it pretty much about anything 
“Some of the stuff those people believe or do is pretty neat and I could get behind it!”
Neato. You sound like some old white tourists who just got back from another country.
