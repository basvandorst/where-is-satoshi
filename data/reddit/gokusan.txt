There will only be 21 million bitcoins, ever. Note one more. Right now there are over 16 million mined and "in use" and with every transaction we get closer to the 21 million.

Hey that's fair!
Thank you for being nice. ��

The site was up, but it was unusable; [have a look at their twitter feed for yourself.](
I'm still pretty new to all of this, but I'm willing to learn.
How am I supposed to send my funds from one wallet to another without relying on an online service?
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:52:13
Where exactly can I read up on this?
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:37:24
TIME TO BUY
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:26:56
Thanks for taking the time! ��
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:59:13
Is there any public roadmap? :-)
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:36:01
Thanks for the detailed answer. Seems like I haven't got any since I bought end of August. Oh well :-)
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:57:28
It says *imported addresses* and *watch only*. Does that not mean what I think it means?
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:09:22
I'm a nooby and I got €500 I'm holding on the side and I bought some for a hundred euros when it was in a dip and I made 50 Euros already, so it's pretty worth it with small amounts you can afford to lose in my opinion.
I sold it for €150 when it was at €5600 and I bought some this morning at €5300. I'm at about €180 right now. That's €80 in exactly one month from "day trading", so that's not too bad is it?
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:29:42
Is it? Mine says *Error loading full wallet functionality. Service might temporarily be unavailable.*

Doesn't look hacked to me. Buggy, yes, but not hacked.

Irrelevant story but feel like sharing.
I was a passenger in a car crash last year in Australia and spent about 24h in the hospital. Got transferred from bumfuck nowhere to the Perth Royal Hospital by jet and I've had fuck all to pay for lol

What does G-Sync do?
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:47:06
Can't the mods enforce a rule as to use the stickies only? Make a new one at each major ATH and delete the rest.

Bitpanda :-)
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:34:12
When did the BCC fork happen and how do I figure out if I have any; I have my private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:25:57
Yeah and it's killing me. I wanted to sell at 7400 but the site would't let me..
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:31:26
Walk me through it. I'm from the EU and I bought mine on Bitpanda a while ago.
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:52:56
You probably wondered stupider things than this.
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:19:58
Some people rather ask and be a part of a community unlike salty dicks like yourself.
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:00:14
So it's not behind the paywall.

You can't build a gaming SDK on top of Bitcoin.

Enjin is the best performing coin of 2019 to date.
