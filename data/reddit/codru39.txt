I'm probably blind as I couldn't find anything related to "*private key that was imported by an attacker*" in his story. Can You help me, please?

I suppose the LN user and the LN node have the same role, isn't it? Any LN-capable wallet is acting like a LN node, with different set of payment channels, this is how I understand it.
So, the LN network is a fully independent p2p network consisting of software client/server parts, called nodes. The nodes are exchanging encrypted messages (like regular messengers). On the highest level those messages are implementing Alice-Bob-Carol financial relationships. As result, the LN client is making regular transactions to the blockchain(open/close channels).
Is that correct?

Thanks all for the answers, I still would like to read something about the architecture of LN with clear descriptions. 
All that stuff about funds moving principles from Alice to Bob and routing I already know.

Sure, the physical media can be different, most likely it will be internet.

They still don't have custom fee option in their wallet and the minimal fee which you can set today is something like 200 sat/b. I don't think You will see segwit addresses there soon. And this is weird as this is the only Android app for the Ledger hard wallet.
