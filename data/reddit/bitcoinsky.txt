It was meant sarcastically against doubters.
@_date: 2015-01-11 01:00:34
thanks for your suggestions! I really appreciate it. I changed: storable: anywhere, e.g. as a piece of paper. allright, changed into kilograms
@_date: 2015-01-11 02:02:24
allright, changed in kilograms.

C'mon, look at his eyes when asked at which price he got in :-)
@_date: 2016-01-22 21:06:28
 I hope you support both
 that's the plan-- part of eliminating single points of failure
@_date: 2016-03-03 19:56:37
This man is so damn right...

I love bitcoin and played around with photoshop.. I am not native English, so if you have any suggestions: give it to me :-) And: if you wanna use it: use it. For any kind of use. Perhaps if you accept bitcoin at your shop, print it and stick it somewhere at your shop.

you sound arrogant, like: "hey, my slow fee-bitcoin is the coolest of the world - but stay away, there is no place for everyone!"
it is simply to early for the "fee-market". better would be: getting some more (millions) of users, showing them a reliable, cool network - and prepare them slowly for fees. and then: take a small fee from millions and not a high fee from thousands.
@_date: 2016-03-07 08:24:41
You might be right. But I think many people hold on something because it is THE satoshi protocol and dont wanna change it because of THIS - without knowing that the blocksize limit was only meant to be a workaround.
@_date: 2015-01-11 02:43:37
tresor. hehe, kind of german... thanks, changed into "safe"
@_date: 2015-01-11 02:33:24
Whoops, 40.000 changed into 40,000
@_date: 2016-03-05 20:53:20
The question isnt about why, its about why not.
@_date: 2016-01-26 07:17:32
I am gonna cut that out and repost it
@_date: 2016-03-06 01:23:20
sounds promising
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:22:06
2mb is NOT bad, guys. The blockchain ist NOT yours, it belongs to ALL who want to use it. And as far as is there is NO "lightning network", the hurdles to get in should be as low as possible. We need MORE users, not less. Maybe segwit is good (iam sure it is) but why not letting some pressure to build a better segwit with some months more time by raising to 2mb while testing segwit til its really secure?
Edit: and guys: the blocksize was only made by satoshi for spam reasons. It was made to be simply raised when scaling is necessary. And I can NOT imagine satoshi wanted to block new users by raising the fees. Not before 2050 :-)
@_date: 2015-01-11 01:15:45
Oh yeah, let's handle some blocks!

So, could Rootstock just start if they wanted to?
@_date: 2016-01-13 14:21:57
And for those who have problems playing the video (US citizens): take this proxy-one: 
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:11:47
And there could have been many more... twice as many for example.

Some months ago, Matthew Driver of Mastercard dismissed Bitcoin. But somehow he completely changed his mind.
@_date: 2016-01-29 16:59:56
THIS is way funnier:  
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:07:52
eth unlimeted: not really: about 10k+ through mining every year makes a percentually decreasing supply over time
and: if there will be a btc fork, there will be 42 million btc :-)
@_date: 2016-03-12 19:30:42
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:12:32
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:19:35
they are all at r/btc
@_date: 2017-03-17 10:27:37
sorry, yes, right, i meant 10 millions + / year
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:24:32
So, will Mike Hearn now come back to the party?
@_date: 2016-06-30 18:48:44
Let's hope magic 8 ball won't be right.
@_date: 2016-06-20 06:24:43
one of the best bitcoin commercials i've seen :-)
@_date: 2017-01-21 14:52:15
But: you made it into the first block!
@_date: 2016-12-20 13:51:10
I changed some letters for the video ;-)
@_date: 2016-11-11 06:59:45
yeah, thats a problem. a solution could be: write something like a testament: "there is some bitcoin wallet.dat on this drive. there is some password on this other location (the location should be a secret location, give only a hint that your beloved will understand) google yourself, how to access bitcoin with wallet.dat and password. trust noone else. noone!"
@_date: 2016-12-20 16:08:06
Man, thank you! You really know how to motivate! 
@_date: 2016-12-20 13:44:57
I wanted to have a very solid Bitcoin wallet. But it should be beautiful. So I took some metal and tried it.
@_date: 2016-12-20 19:51:01
I hope with this information my video gets a little bit more exciting ;-)
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:31:47
You are right. While filming I didn't know about the reason of base58. I just tried out every letter and saw, that there could be a confusion. So the step of "zero-marking" is actually inessential.﻿
@_date: 2016-02-02 23:17:46
I pivatemessaged him, let's see what happens.
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:44:11
I know it sounds ironic but I would really like to know why tapping the break pedal should be good.
@_date: 2016-02-05 18:35:35
I am a German Bitcoin noob. My bitcoin core runs on a 32 bit windows 7 starter laptop, 2 gig ram. Core is running smooth, but it wont get more than 8 connections. What am I doing wrong? Fritz Box (router) is configured to open port 8333, what's still wrong? Thanks for help.
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:38:58
Dear core guys, please explain him why bitcoin doesnt work as a cheap and fast money transmitter any more.
@_date: 2016-02-27 16:23:16
What will cost an average Bitcoin-transaction (to get into the next block) within the next months if the block-size stays at 1mb?
@_date: 2016-02-25 10:27:57


WTF? You mean it's like: "If you wanna have a fast and reliable Bitcoin stop telling people about it!"? And again: WTF? The Bus is full, use another one?
@_date: 2016-02-03 00:29:51
A question of someone who thinks public thoughts are not relevant.
@_date: 2016-02-03 01:52:23
okayokayokay... calm down and buy some btc. they seem to be cheap right now. i will link my twitterpost
@_date: 2016-02-16 01:36:48
Don't call it BitCoin.
And for the next time: tell them to download a bitcoin wallet app and send them some bits. That always works when I do these talks.
@_date: 2016-02-29 09:50:16
such an arrogant attitude.  what about that "cheap and quick money trancaction"-bitcoin? if i have to wait so long and pay so much to get into the block: why should i using it as money transmitter? in europe there is sepa between banks: takes some hours - for free.
@_date: 2016-02-05 18:47:49
Thanks, that solved it! Bitnode recognizes my ip as a fullnode,  incoming connections possible. But unfortunately still 8. How long does it take no connect more?
Update: 9 - Thanks!
@_date: 2016-10-15 21:46:45
i sent a key from my phone wallet which changes every time..
@_date: 2016-10-15 21:51:38
and this long thing beginning with 02?
@_date: 2016-10-15 21:53:07
hey op, which fee did you choose?
@_date: 2016-10-15 22:08:26
ahhh.. thanks for explaining.
@_date: 2016-10-15 21:45:44
is this a private key :-)?
@_date: 2016-10-15 22:00:20
i mean, what is this 02a6d64df4679dd2a612865578de3d5994020ac3d8147d39dbeeda3c2cd73a9af0?
