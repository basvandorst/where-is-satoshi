Cheers.  Figured you were right as I've read On liberty by Mills and in the preface the roots of his ideology are discussed.  Didn't take long to google and check if you were correct or not.

The usage of the term libertarian exists outside of the development of the philosophy. The ideas were developed before then.
Going from the wiki(cos I'm no scholar) [Locke's Two Treatises of Government 1689]( lays out the foundations of Libertarianism, while Socialism seems to have developed later from multiple sources starting after the [French Revolution ending 1789]( apart from [Paine's Agrarian Justice 1797]( which I would regard as not a complete socialist philosophy as it only addresses land ownership.

No mate, this is just me,  probably should have checked my post history first.  But you didn't bother to google either term before throwing shade before so that doesn't surprise me.

[Tut tut.](
* [Socialism 1830ish](
* [Libertarianism 17th Century](
While both existed prior to those dates no real philosophical frameworks seem to have been proposed by either side before then.  Google first then call someone a liar.  Oh wait your name though...
