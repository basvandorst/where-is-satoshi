The latter (Assange, for those getting confused) is doing more harm than good to the leaks community these days with those full, underacted dumps. Even if you don't care about the arguably/relatively innocent bystanders who had their home addresses, personal contact information and credit card numbers put on public display via his recent leaks, you can't ignore the fact that this type of impudent raw-info dumping is creating *in the flesh* the straw man argument that has existed for years, previously without merit but now with teeth because of Assange, that government leaks can get good people hurt. Whether they actually do or not!
Snowden knew that this inevitable media spin combined with Assange's personal politics would have resulted in public interest in his leaks quickly wilting; Squandering his sacrifice while neutering any lasting momentum they might create. Assange does not live under extreme threat, he lives under effective house arrest in the Ecuadorean embassy in London where he is guarded by security forces from two countries, any harm coming to him would result in an international diplomacy crisis. And I personally find his recent lack of prudence suspect, as his close ties to RT combined with Russia's tendency to meddle in foreign elections combined with an underacted leak of personal emails during the DNC are all amazingly coincidental. Maybe he's playing the long con, if you want keep your faith in him, but I feel like he's becoming nothing more than a self-aggrandizing power broker these days who will end up hurting the very movement he excited.
For all we know, 90% of Snowden's NSA documents could actually be very dangerous liabilities to life and welfare of good people if thrown out into the wild. They could be an actual version of what the military feared when Chelsea Manning's [actually harmless] leaks hit the web, and full knowledge of them could result in lots of civilians dying or losing their means of welfare. Clearly Snowden wanted to put his trove in the hands of someone with global media ties who also shared his vision of prudence and responsibility. Someone who wouldn't hijack the information to create personal political leverage, who wouldn't just dump everything online in a "searchable database" for only the most manically obsessed to sort through but instead put the information in a journalistic context where it could be elucidated for your average non-infosec-interested citizen. That person is Glenn Greenwald. It certainly isn't Assange.
Don't get me wrong, anti-neoliberal movements all over owe Assange for his trailblazing and the tools he has contributed. But he's played out his usefulness, and his hero worship is overblown.

For all these guy's enthusiasm, I wonder how long it'll take them to realize that a blockchain on it's own doesn't mean security... That it's the fully distributed nature of proof calculation that makes it secure. A single organization cannot run a blockchain-based ledger in the way that they're thinking. Facebook can 'distribute' Libra and run mining data centers all over the planet... Wouldn't make a difference, if it's just Facebook doing it.
And bitcoin has a decade head start in creating that multi-stake distributed infrastructure. At this point I don't see how any legitimate competition would even manage to catch up...

A size increase is a hard fork, and a hard fork is scary. If you do it at all you want to do it just once and get it right the first time. So you spend time on your efficiencies first, so that you have a better idea of exactly what your hard capacity will need to be once you do increase block size. BTC is the large, slow-moving center of a dynamic and turbulent crypto ecosystem, and it's also beta, and this needs to be understood by those pursuing monetary interests in the space. Long term stability and efficiency should come definitively before short-term tweaks to usability.

These are all really dumb comparisons because they are terrible analogies. The only utility of bitcoin mining is securing the BTC blockchain. So the 138M GJ/year is for *just* that end purpose. The utility of gold mining on the other hand is multifold as gold is a periodic element with tons of different uses. It's not just a store of value, it's also ubiquitous in electronics, popular in jewelry, and probably has dozens of novel scientific and medical uses (Half of the readers of this post probably have some permanently fixed in their mouths, for instance).
The energy costs of bitcoin mining are an unignorable and exorbitant liability that we're better off recognizing and honestly attempting to address than try to hand-wave away with limp, sorry apologies like this doof is wasting *his* energy on.

When I'm not being a bitcoin dork I'm often being a alternative transportation dork. In traffic engineering that phenomenon is actually very well studied and has a name, it's called induced demand. The idea is that increasing capacity increases incentive for the public to use the provided facilities, thereby cyclically increasing demand to such a degree that it meets almost any supply you could throw at it in a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. Through the use of robust complimentary alternative networks (trains, bikes, bus) and economic incentives like demand-based tolling you can ensure that a city's transportation network can gracefully handle monstrous surges in demand in an efficient fashion.
I'm sure you can imagine how this knowledge has somewhat informed my opinions on big blocks and segwit / ln.

I too have been in since 2013 and still use Coinbase (I also used to use Gox and Bitstamp but only a few times each). I really have no excuse other than laziness. I only ever move some savings over from USD when the price dips, and since I don't have to wait to create an account there cause it already exists and because I can lock in a price via bank or credit card even if I don't have USD sitting in Coinbase, it's just been an easy default that makes the stupid large fees *almost* worth it.

You need to hear it from me? Do you really think that there's anything stopping a determined industrialized government from seizing hardware, snooping the internet, and cracking down with heavy sentences until bitcoin is driven to a tiny criminal fringe? Would you *really* confuse such a fringe with mainstream adoption? Get real.
Also I'm not judging bitcoin itself, I'm just being a realist. I'm here in the first place because I hodl bitcoin. I just don't hold any fantastical, immature illusions about it's potential resilience because that inevitably leads to poor choices and this inane honey badger technological cargo culting. I don't need to believe in that fairy tale to prefer the currency's actual reality. The sort of vapid cheerleadering you're participating in here gives bitcoin it's horrible reputation as playing host to a crock of crazies. You think we're having an argument and you *have to win it* because if you lose it destabilizes this 'undefeatable bitcoin' narrative that you for some reason have been foolish enough to make the foundation of your confidence in the currency.
IMO this lack of understanding of context and consequence is a larger threat to bitcoin than authoritarian institutions.

I think that the solution to bitcoin's energy demands should come from bitcoin, not from the utilities taxed with the extra burden it creates. Bitcoin should do what most FOSS projects do here, and draw inspiration from it's myriad forks. There are dozens of decent PoW architectures in cryptoland these days, some far more secure than others, and therein can be inspiration. However in the long run I imagine that licensing and regulations from local governments to run crypto mining operations will beat us to that punch if we don't act soon.
By the way your point about the US military backing the value of the USD has merit. I think it does, that's why it's often referred to as the petro-dollar. But I also think that a currency should be left to perform on it's own in a market, not be propped up by a military, only further strengthening my opposition to the US military...
@_date: 2018-09-16 21:31:11

You're one of those 'anarcho-capitalists'. I assumed so based on your flawed definition of capitalism but I didn't want erroneously to jump to conclusions.
I'll be nice, I'd like to have this discussion. I think we can probably both agree that sociopolitical ideology, commonly possessing two components (The social and the political), can hence be represented as a 2-dimensional sociopolitical 'political compass' with four quadrants, yes? You have the 'social' authoritarian-libertarian axis, and the 'economic' axis (sometimes referred to as socialist-capitalist). [Tada]( Anything above the line has a central government, so not us. Anything below the line does not - The libertarians.
So, I'm a left-libertarian - I don't want central government, and I want an economic system that does not utilize private property. This want is backed up by theory - It's not a purely emotional want - The same theory for both axes, in fact (Which I can absolutely elaborate on if it wouldn't bore you, it's not terribly complex). The only requirement of my core of my beliefs to remain sustainable is that humans are not intrinsically bad. If they actually are, then it does admittedly fall apart. But I am confident that humans are not intrinsically bad, and that capitalism requires the opposite belief (Which it refers to as 'selfish') to maintain it's own complex.
My quad's primary argument against your quad (right-libertarian, or in the US simply 'libertarian'), is that the wealth accumulation of capital *requires* state violence to enforce, long term (And if you look at US history you see the state doing just that over and over again). If you create an economic situation where the majority have far less the minority, that minority will eventually rise up and take back what is rightfully theirs and only cops / military can stop that. Ancaps make an argument for private security here - But if you have the majority of the wealth and maintain your own security force... You are now the state. You will eventually arrive at either some bizarre techno-feudalism, or you will die in another revolution.
So you see, for left-libertarians (We can just call them anarchists), it's the right-libs who are oxymoronic.

LN as a protocol seems less centralizing than mining. Mining late in the game involves huge up-front costs and high risk. Being an LN node late in the game, as far as I can tell, won't involve either of those barriers to entry. I could see peering requirements of some sort - Like certain nodes denying communication with other nodes for arbitrary reasons - Becoming a centralizing factor, but also one that can be anticipated.

This will never end. As long as bitcoin exists as an open, decentralized network owned by no one, it will be assailed annually by groups or individuals who's only wish is to control it and make it 'theirs'. That's not 'crony capitalism' because there is no such thing: There is only just 'capitalism' and this is simply what it does. It finds the capital that is not private, and it assaults, besets, and undermines that capital until it's made private, until is it controlled by one instead of many. The *specific* novelty of bitcoin is that it is designed exactly to resist this tendency. It is a capitalist currency designed to save capitalism from itself. So powerful capitalists will of course always be trying to find a way to make it theirs, to control it. And it will always be a dishonest endeavor.

I don't think that bitcoin is going to do shit to egalitarianize is the world, I think that central control of money is one small unjust power hierarchy in the face of capitalism itself, which is in turn one of multiple large unjust power hierarchies that oppress the world, and many bitcoin users can't even see past that first layer for how blinded they are by the second let alone the third. In fact I *recognize* that bitcoin has several very nasty potential side-effects that might actually take the place of the injustices it may manage to unseat. But I also recognize that I'm of the economic caste that routinely get sacrificed and cast off as a part of capitalism's practically ritual mood swings, so I do what I can to protect myself against that, and the relative value of bitcoin seems like a good way to do so.

Who taught you that definition of capitalism? Because yes there is an agreed upon and well understood definition of the word but yours is not it. If yours was it then anarcho-communalism would also count as capitalism because it would fit your definition, as would any sort of libertarian *socialist* economy. The *actual* definition of capitalism entails private ownership for profit as the central characteristic, with capital accumulation, wage labor, a competitive market, voluntary exchange, and a price system as secondary defining characteristics. [See here]( and note that voluntary exchange is not the same as consent, and in fact can be coercive. Also note that capitalism does *not* require a free ('laissez-faire') market, just a competitive one - And 'competition' does not mean 'fair competition'.
Capitalism will always contain the traits that result in what you prefer to call 'crony capitalism'. It's just intrinsic to capitalism. Bitcoin promotes *transparent* capitalism, which can result in a less 'corrupt' economic environment if you will, but the capital accumulation that allows for those sort of antics to evolve remains.

Mining is already consolidated into areas where energy is cheap. But your claim that excess energy is produced otherwise is unsubstantiated, and probably false. Almost all power facilities are capable of ramping production up or down to meet demand. Therefore bitcoin mining in a particular market just raises the energy cost in that market (Should they be capable of meeting the demand in the first place, with a far worse outcome otherwise).

We can argue that banning bitcoin would for some reason go differently than every other ban of anything that the government has ever instituted, but it's all conjecture until they actually do.

First of all that's not communism, that's socialization of industries. We do that in the USA too with our schools, mass transit, roads, water, retirement, and defense.
A country that recognizes private property is not socialist, much less communist. Abolishing of private property completely is the *bare minimum* for qualifying as a socialist economy. The USA doesn't do that, nor does Venezuela.
Please examine [this chart of countries listed by percentage of economy in public sector]( (Sort by ILO, descending). Please note how far down the chart Venezuela is - Below such capitalist starlets as Croatia, The Bahamas, Seychelles, and Singapore.

If the US oligarchy wanted people on a crypto instead of petrodollar it would not be nearly as hard for them to get the switch made as you imagine. As you said, they could just outright ban bitcoin if they wanted, likewise they can mandate a new digital currency just as easily (It would be a large initiative but it would essentially be easy). Bitcoin lives alongside USD because the oligarchy is making bank from it just like you and I are. If it ever seriously begins threatening the current power structure then yes you will see moves to have it banned or even confiscated, do hope that it has taken a solid hold in enough places elsewhere by that point for such moves to be futile.

But in the past few years Makerbot has been a textbook example of a company "selling out" in the worst of ways - Attempting to patent the very designs they fought to free, making their machines non-standardized and hard to repair and just kind of shunning the community that launched them in general.

I actually added the "purportedly" and the "Or at the very least tried to" to soften any accusatory tone that might have been perceived in reading my comment. To be clear, I don't think of Mr. Ulbricht as a violent criminal, I think of him as a high-profile target of the FBI and I personally feel that the hitman he had correspondence with - If he actually did - Was probably an undercover agent trying to set him up. But when I read things like "He helped reduce crime" and "no turf, less violence" my eyes roll into the back of my head and I feel the need to add some moderation to our collective enthusiasm regarding this guy's complete innocence. If drugs are still illegal even when they're purchased pseudonymously, they still have the potential to create a dangerous, violent climate. I'm pretty disappointed that the reaction to my attempt at moderation is complete dismissal. It's not like I'm disagreeing wholeheartedly with everyone or stating anything other than the facts as they are publicly understood.

No I totally see that mining enables the blockchain and the blockchain enables potentially *any* sort of public ledger or trust system, unlocking a myriad of previously untenable applications (Like digital currency), and those applications have serious value that in some ways justifies a physical, real-world expenditure of energy to support.
But upon realizing how fast that cryptographic arms race escalates and the incredible amounts of energy it actually consumes, the scale of it all threatens to negate the positive impacts of crypto public ledgers in the first place. I recall reading last year that the total energy costs of bitcoin mining were estimated to be about $15 million per day. That's a large city's worth of electricity use, if I'm estimating correctly. Almost all devoted to this technology's initial application, Bitcoin, nothing else yet. Do $15 million in XBT even get moved every day yet? And then of course the potential environmental and energy availability impacts that this adds to a world where both of those things are strained already.
I don't consider this a damning situation for bitcoin, but I do consider it to be a serious achille's heel that will need to be addressed at some point. In an increasingly virtual world it seems hypocritical for our abstract needs to begin creating as much physical work as our literal physical needs. Computers are real and cost money, but like my old boss used to love saying: "Don't work hard. Work smart." See also "One step forward, two back."

The interesting thing is, she's not a libertarian or techie or former business entrepreneur or any other stereotypical pro-bitcoin type. She grew up as an extremely poor Puerto Rican immigrant and has dedicated her life to public service. She was for a time a co-chair of the Working Families party of NYC. On top of all that, the main piece of dirt that most of her opponents ever fling at her is the fact that her biggest financial contributors are big banks, and that she's seen as a threat to small businesses.

True, I should have been more specific. Still, the TLC sets the rules for yellow cabs, including payment options.

His cab company is the TLC (Taxi and Limousine Commission of NYC), and I can almost guarantee you that this is against their rules. The TLC goes to great lengths to create consumer protections for their riders and I imagine that they'd see the "non-refundability" of single bitcoin transactions to be a big no-no. So sadly this probably won't last. However, I could totally see them partnering with Coinbase or similar to provide payments for all of their cabs one day.

In my opinion it's a huge shame that mining in the bitcoin protocol doesn't do any useful work beyond verifying the blockchain. Isn't the computational capacity of all bitcoin miners greater than the world's top 50 supercomputers or some shit? And distributed everywhere instead of feeding together off some singular efficient power source. That seems like a huge, irresponsible waste. Here's hoping that distributed workloads can be applied to bitcoin mining in the future in the same way that some altcoins have already done.

It's a fallacy that rests on the liberal (American definition of liberal) desire to believe all issues can be reduced to two sides with equal merit and morality, and that giving both of those sides equal weight despite differences in rational and logical foundations can guarantee a just outcome. It ignores the fact that one side may not be interested in justice at all, or may not even be concerned with the concept in the first place. It ignores the fact that the motivation of those two sides may be completely incongruous - One side may be motivated by concern for one's mortal safety while the other side may be motivated by nothing more than greed. It ignores the fact that cynical minds can take advantage of the whole fallacious presupposition to move the conversation further toward their side by inches through a series of 'compromises'. It ignores the fact that there may be more than two sides in the first place. And worst of all in my opinion, it allows the lazy or unobservant or disingenuous to say things like "Punching Nazis is just as bad as being a Nazi". Dear lord I can't even begin to imagine how many World War II veteran grandpas have been rolling over in their graves this year.

Very cool idea, reminds me of [Open Source Ecology]( and their "Global Village Construction Set", which also has the potential to be self-replicating and self-sustaining, but at least for now keeps the labor in the hands of the humans running the operation.
I think that a lot of our distributed production or "factory in a box" fantasies stem from our desire to modularize and universalize our cultural knowledge. As humans, we come complete with self-assembling replication instructions for our own physical bodies in the form of DNA, instructions that have themselves self-assembled over billions of years of environmentally guided evolution. This is true for all animals, but in the case of humans those instructions also come with what you could consider to be an "extensibility option" or an "API" or an expandable "plug-in library": Culture. At it's most basic that culture is tradition and language and social knowledge, but at it's more advanced levels right now that culture is also the skills and know-how to create and operate entire industries, to coordinate entire companies and countries, to operate and continually develop new technology, technology being at it's most basic definition a useful physical manifestation of our culture, and all technology no matter how complex being built upon successively simpler technologies that at some point down that pyramid of requirements can be intrinsically understood.
The thing is, that culture is potentially ephemeral. When we stop communicating, that culture disappears and does not have to come back. It's self-sustained and can be extinguished long before our own DNA would ever be extinguished, and as such a lot of us who understand this feel a need to organize and protect it, because unlike the instructions needed to create *us*, the instructions to extend us are not contained in out blood. This is traditionally the domain of (for example) a librarian, but more recently the boom in information technology has enabled new ideas and possibilities for the dissemination and safekeeping of cultural knowledge. These start with the idea of a digital codex, like The Hitchhiker's Guide or (Don't laugh) The Pokédex, and on into digital-biological interfaces like The Matrix. More recently we've begun to realize the preservationist powers of distributed mediums like bitcoin, where knocking any number of involved physical devices out of commission cannot destroy the collective culture contained on said network (And as an aside, I find it interesting that more often than not the threats that these distributed efforts are commonly protecting culture against aren't natural disasters, but are ourselves. Bitcoin the currency seeks to protect economic culture from the whims of traditional economic industry, while distributed production seeks to protect with an almost Marxist energy the means of production from the inevitabilities of capitalism).
Of course, all of these solutions still rely on *us* more than just living. Still considerably more effort than just having a set of DNA. At some point soon we'll likely be adding self-sustaining robotic custodians to the mix, which will certainly both complicate things and broaden horizons in ways that none of us can perfectly foresee. But in the meantime, while we figure all of this out I do keep seeing odd inconsistencies, mistakes from history possibly being repeated and the occasional potentially fatal inefficiency here and there in distributed concepts. As you seem to be fully invested (Quite literally) in the idea of distributed production, would you mind answering some critical question I have about this tech? Keep in mind, I do see efforts like these as valid alternatives to centralized production, but I'd like to point out what I see as current hamstrings and hopefully learn what's being done about them, if anything yet:
1) An environmental concern: My greatest fear for distributed production is that it won't be efficient or environmentally sustainable enough to be viable in the world of extremes created by 150 years of centralized global industrialization. While I do believe that human beings operate most sustainably and happily at the "tribal" or "town" scale - And that this is a perfect scale for distributed production - We no longer live in such a world. When there is demand for something today, there is demand for millions of units. How can distributed production realistically appease this kind of demand? Or rather, do you even expect it to? Computers are often built on full-city "campuses" to cut out the environmental/monetary costs of transportation of goods (See Shenzhen) and create flexible response to competition and consumer needs. Imagine the pollution generated from goods transportation *alone* if the production of Shenzhen was distributed across all of Asia, let alone the whole world? It would be a calamity - Global ocean shipping as it is today apparently takes our ozone to task already. What if this was the kind of transportation required by production, as well? Do you have a plan to address this or is it seen more as a "down-the-road" issue? Or (And this is a valid response) do you see distributed production as specifically a "post-collapse" solution to sustaining human industry?
2) An economic concern (My girlfriend is a literary theorist focused on the influence of Marx so I find this aspect particularly interesting): OK so via distributed production, more people can "own the means of production" by owning just part of it instead of all of it. Factory machines become open sourced and the machines that create those machines are also open sourced. The barrier to entry for an incoming newbie lowers because the initial investment shrinks, and via replication a clear path for growth of their efforts exists. But in a capitalist world, how does this really prevent the largest fish from eating the other fish all over again? Like bitcoin mining, aren't the first on the scene the ones with a greatest advantage? What's stopping someone from creating a superior part-making machine and closed-sourcing it and then charging lots of money or royalties to use it? What's stopping a very large producer from suing a smaller producer out of existence for frivolous reasons? Once someone has all the machines assembled in one spot, what's stopping them from continually growing to current industrial scales, pricing out everyone else and bringing us back to square one? Essentially... How is a real-world distributed production system in any way resistant to the "coalescence" effects of global capitalism that we already live with? Furthermore, how is the idea of distributed production any different from the pre-industrial "Putting-Out System" cottage industry, which in reality did not give producers a means with which to grow?
3) A regulatory concern: This question can be asked of almost any "disruptive" technology. Traditional systems that have existed for a long time have had their greatest flaws revealed to the public and in response the public has (Over time) developed regulations to protect against those flaws. These rules aren't always perfect but they keep the consumer from being screwed over and often also protect the business from unrealistic loss. Insurance requirements, regulatory agencies, industry-specific laws and other such things necessary for safety and order when you're operating in a world of 7 billion diverse interests. A disruptive tech that comes in and improves upon the existing system but also defies the assumptions of existing regulations can create big problems for consumers and competitors alike despite clear improvements in all-around workings. Forget ISP and taxi regulations and how tech has turned those on their heads. Just think how important industrial / factory regulations are to your average person. Factories can only be in certain places due to noise and pollution concerns. The environmental impact of many factories must be closely monitored to avoid contamination of the surrounding area. Etc etc. When everybody can have a tiny piece of factory in their home that's pretty nifty. But now every road is an industrial shipping road. Every household can deal with industrial chemicals. Every family member can be in close contact with dangerous machinery. Within the household these are not industrial-scale issues, but across a neighborhood they are. The total *volume* is still the same overall or larger (If we are to sustain our current production capacity as a society). Without the concentration of industry that our current system has, individuals might be hard-pressed to meet current safety and environmental demands. Nevermind what a massive undertaking it would be to inspect for these things. How do you suggest we regulate for this? What do you suggest we do / don't do? Who's responsible for compliance with any regulations in such a system?
Sorry for the very long-winded post, these ideas and questions have been kicking around in my head for a long time. I guess the theme of all my inquiries is scale. Have you ever seen Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind? I always fantasize about a far-flung *post*-post-apocalypse world like that, where humanity has returned to stable medieval populations and yet surviving technology creates a sustainable system of trade and production, distributed across regions where residents of individual towns can be skilled in particular trades and provided for via a network like the one you envision. But, I have a lot of trouble seeing it work in an instantly-connected world of Capitalism. But I'd love to hear what you think of all this.

That wasn't actually a particularly satisfying explanation of bitcoin, even for someone completely uninitiated to it. It leaves out cryptography completely, which is the answer to most of the questions a new user will immediately have after watching this video (Why is trusting other users with my ledger safe? How does bitcoin throttle the supply of new currency effectively? Who / what is the central company or authority running it?), so I can only imagine that the uninitiated viewing this leave either confused, or asking the wrong questions like the ones I just thought of. You don't have to get into the nuts and bolts of the math, you just have to communicate the concept of a trustless algorithm. Done. This trend of little primer info videos is nice and all, but if you can't *actually* explain the topic you're trying to tackle in under 2 minutes maybe don't try at all...

He's actually a social progressive, arguably the world's most economically powerful social progressive. In the past ten years he's given *billions* of dollars to contraception advocacy / abortion advocacy / women's advocacy groups and has convinced both Gates and Zuckerberg to give at least half of their wealth away in a similar manner. He's also acknowledged publicly that his good fortunate is due in no small part to arguably unfair social rewards in our society.

What I mean is more that Family Guy seems to me to have a lot of followers on Reddit, moreso than elsewhere, perhaps due to the similar demographics of both (Young, male, white). But this is true for a lot of prime time cartoons and I'm sure there are other animated shows that have a bigger following here than Family Guy (Archer, Rick and Morty, The Simpsons, etc). But I wasn't really looking to make any statement about Family Guy's popularity. What I mean to say is, if I try and search for anything original or new that Family Guy did, I come up empty-handed.

Is that correct? And if correct, this can be done to a channel retroactively? Nothing different about initial channel setup?

This sounds like a bad faith argument against moderation you just don't agree with, even if that's not your intention. You may not realize how hard you're downplaying the inconvenience or even impossibility of eeking productive discussion out of an unmoderated venue completely co-opted by selfish actors. I wonder if what you may actually want, and what this community *actually* needs, is an improved methodology for effective moderation. Reddit's moderation relies on a benevolent dictatorship that rests on the assumption that the dictator is personally invested in the health of the community and propped up by the fallacy that you can always opt-out and start your own side community on another sub if need be (You can't, not really, and that's also the crux of all societal coercion). We do not have to and can not get rid of moderation, but we probably should find more distributed, delegated, less corruptible frameworks for that moderation. And in general, try to be more honest and mature with *ourselves* and not resort so often to being greedy little snots :P
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:14:12
He's right about true consensus requiring open discussion. And he's right about Reddit being moderated. He's wrong on the assumption that open discussion isn't (Or should not be) moderated. *Any* completely unmoderated discussion, closed or open, will eventually be co-opted.

What would a small-scale hydro mining hut look like? I did the math the other day and it seems like any hydro generator capable of powering even a few high-wattage miners would have to be at least a medium-sized stream with a 10+ meter drop. Not exactly a home backyard DIY setup. Do you mean like, multiple people with miners in their basements running off power *sourced* from hydro? Because even in that case I'm pretty sure that even in the Pacific Northwest residential gets a different (higher) rate than the bulk rate that data centers purchase at.

@_date: 2017-08-11 20:53:43
That's just what it's about for you, not for me. To be honest my relationship with bitcoin is definitely *complicated*, but I can explain it. Well at least I think I can.
* I'm not an anarcho-capitalist but it would be accurate to call me an anarchist. I believe hierarchical power is unhealthy and unsustainable (The difference between an-caps and all other ans is that they either accept hierarchy or choose to not acknowledge certain kinds of hierarchy exist. Everyone else defines anarchy as governance sans hierarchy), and I therefore like decentralized / distributed / non-hierarchical systems and proofs. 
* I therefore don't consider institutions like The Fed or the US government or most corporations and companies legitimate. But also believe that violence never results in permanent solutions and generally just creates power vacuums that beget more violence and suffering.
* So I'm against accelerationism, the idea that we should encourage the sundering and deterioration of existing systems to hasten a revolution.
* Successful anarchy relies most of all on the hearts and minds of the people who practice it, so I believe that modern anarchy may best be brought into practice by converting the smallest and most numerous institutions - like community boards and town governments and small businesses - into anarchist structures. People need examples and experience.
* Most people don't seem to understand that currency doesn't necessitate capitalism. Only the methods of distribution of that currency. Almost any conceived post-industrial anarchist society *will require representations of value* at some time and place. They will also need to keep track of all sorts of things, more likely than now in a decentralized and trustless fashion.
* Bitcoin (Both the tech and the currency) is a wonderful vehicle for *all* of these concepts. Even though it is being presented and used in a capitalist context, it brings with it all of the themes of decentralization, reclamation of institutions, peaceful conversion and sneaks in a whole load of lessons about the value of distributed, leveled power. It's a hearts and minds changer. It bites off a *chunk* of the system, not so much that things destabilize but enough that truth gets shown to power.
TL;DR Bitcoin is my best bet for paying off my student loans

I recognize three types of property: Public, private, and personal. Capitalist economies treat personal property as private, Wikipedia has [a decent explanation]( of their distinction within socialist economies.
I would prefer to see all private property re-distinguished into personal and public and treated as such. Private property doesn't really fly under socialism and especially not libertarian socialism (Which is the more politically expedient way of saying anarcho-communism), but personal property is why Marxists aren't actually coming for your toothbrush.

@_date: 2017-08-11 23:08:49
Because public property, like private property, generates value through it's use, and the personal ownership of such would therefore make it *private* by denying others access to this stream of value, which is what's known as exploitation.
And because personal property (Your home, your car, your clothes, your sentimental objects, stuff like that) is mentally and physically useful to it's owner, while it's personal possession does not rob the public of a value [that they couldn't just as easily obtain elsewhere].
Now of course, you can find gray areas between these two types. Specific flavors of socialism and anarchism define their line through those gray areas more clearly. But I guess at the most general level, the reason the distinction exists to maximize personal autonomy.

Nah I was just being self-effacingly hyperbolic. 'Rich' is a relatively irrelevant and subjective measure anyway. I agree that the ethics behind how the wealth was obtained is what actually matters. But where ancaps use only lack of violence as their check for morality, other anarchists use lack of hierarchy, and as violence is not the only act that can assert hierarchy this is a more rigorous check. Violence does not include things like coercion, authoritarianism, dependence, etc. Probably all successful popular video game manufacturers would fail that test because someone relying on a paycheck to live fails that test. Organizations like that can certainly be re-configured to avoid such exploitative arrangements, they're just not encouraged to do so in the current economy so you don't see that too often.

'Worth voting on' = Any issue where there's a significant enough difference of opinion that a vote needs to be held. And if there's a significant enough difference of opinion that a vote is worthwhile, there's a significant enough difference of opinion that you won't ever reach a consensus without significant compromise.
I guess I'm not necessarily saying that a majority-takes-all vote would be better, perhaps what I mean to say is that the bitcoin community seems to be approaching the idea of 'consensus' incorrectly. Cynically even, because any measure put to this test with a population this size will fail, every time. So it becomes not a decision-making tool, but a vetoing tool.
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:26:43

First, I don't think of personal property as a socialist invention to counter exploitation. I see all three of these states as potential natural scenarios, I just advocate that we interact with them differently that we currently do in order to maximize [autonomy](
I'm gonna assume you typo'd in your second paragraph and wrote 'private' whenever you meant to write 'personal': If something is scarce / high in demand / not easy to obtain then it would probably end up classified as public property, especially if there was frequent need of it. I assumed for my explanation a situation like we have in the US where there are more than enough houses and cars for everyone, therefore classified them as personal.

Mining emissions are not a direct function of adoption, they're a function of the rate of price increase. The *rate* of the increase determines how profitable it is to invest in mining equipment and electricity. So it makes sense that you'll see mining increases during price spikes, but should the price ever begin to level off we may see the mining industry do the same. It has nothing to do with how many people *use* bitcoin, at least nothing direct. Common misconception, it's not like the world's going to get covered in mining data centers absent regulation.

I fucking love Andreas, I think he honestly and adamantly *cares* about the good that bitcoin can do in the world and that's why he does what he does. He gets emotional when he gets to the core of his description of why bitcoin is important to humanity, you can hear it in his voice.
But I still feel the need to critique what is essentially an anarcho-capitalist vision of equality, or I guess more accurately justice. I know a significant portion of this sub and BTC's userbase would call themselves ancap, many with honest conviction, and so this applies to you too.
I'm an an**com** and so agree wholeheartedly with the idea that proprietary money is a cancer on modern society, and I'm attracted to bitcoin specifically because it is a way to help wrest control from those proprietary systems to the benefit of almost everyone. But, I do so from a place of theory, because no conviction or choice can have a dependable outcome if you can't back it up with an understanding of why. And as a ancom the theory is that the *primary* cancer, the root of all oppression, is unjustified hierarchy: A power inequality that is not mutually revocable, ie able to be cancelled by any participant, without coercion. One can think of dozens if not hundreds of injustices in our society - And proprietary control of money is one of the big ones, which bitcoin is managing to crack - But unjust hierarchy tends to be the common trait throughout all of them.
So when ancaps get excited about the utopia they envision bitcoin creating, I die a little despite sharing a similar-if-not-lesser enthusiasm, because I see them missing one of the biggest unjust hierarchies of all, capitalism (Which I don't confuse with the concept of abstract value represented through money, which is inescapable but completely separable from capitalism). A system that not only encourages but can be shown to *rely* on wealth inequalities and therefore power inequalities, protected by the state, perfectly matches the definition of an unjust hierarchy. I think that we should be excited about the progress toward egalitarianism that bitcoin *may* be unlocking. But I do not think that we should describe it as the herald of utopia because it's really just one small piece of a large puzzle.
Of course I also prefer bitcoin over USD because, as an American generally coerced into capitalism, I have more faith in it's investment capability! However I just consider that a rather large bonus for what is first and foremost an attempt to knock down an injustice. One critique of anarcho-capitalism (Sorry I know I'm throwing a lot at you guys, thanks for humoring me) is that capitalism's wealth disparities, if allowed to continue unregulated, would result in so much power disparity that it would create something akin to feudalism. But, another critique of anarcho-capitalism, or actually just capitalism in general, is that the power disparities it creates actually *require* the protection of a state to maintain, and therefore general respect for such disparities and therefore the economic system itself would dissolve without such support. So as there will *always* be, under even most communal or socialistic economic models, a need to represent value in abstract form, and as the only technological means we have so far to do so justly is bitcoin, I don't see it going away under *any* scenario (Save for apocalyptic conditions where the computers stop working :P ). 
Andreas is right about *money* being necessary to secure bitcoin and any other trustless mechanisms that ride on top of it due to how incentives are organized in capitalism. The whole thing just won't work without there being an abstract value layer, this is a fact that I must concede. But I'm still holding out hope for alternative proofs of work that would be more compatible with alternative economic models that don't prioritize endless expansion and competition (Expressed here through mining) for the times after all the big hierarchies get toppled and ecology becomes a significant priority. Like a democratic confederation somewhere where all legislation and proceedings documented on-chain required cryptographic signing by all parties affected before they could be verified aka 'enacted' and those collective signings would stand in for PoW. Variants like that. I think that a lot of potential very-viable *blockchain* alternatives to bitcoin could exist, just not in our economic paradigm. But hey maybe bitcoin will help us get there one day. Wow thanks for reading all of this.

As for camel case (You can spell it that way too if you want), you should probably read the very short post I linked to. It's no greater than a 4th grade reading level, and explains that camel case is not a brand name and can thus be exempt from the resolution. Although I'm sure you're probably picking on his capitalizing the first C, in which case you should maybe not assume that he's referencing a variable name. You're familiar with object names, yes? And also the fact that programmers can usually standardize their nomenclature however they damn well please?

Reminds me of when people willingly draw the Facebook logo in the corner of their advertisement, although that's something entirely different it still causes the same eyeroll reaction from me.

Serious question from a non-finance person: Is BTC's price being intentionally and artificially depressed by the institutional futures market (CME)? I know that there's a conspiracy theory around this, but is there actual weight to that theory, and as a run-of-the-mill bitcoin user should I be worried? I have noticed that the price has been uncharacteristically level for a good half a year or so and as a relative layman who has watched it spike up and down for years, that implies to me some sort of manipulation or significant protocol change, and I know there was none of the latter.

Bitcoin does nothing to curb state power and I find it's claims of curbing centralization specious. It's disappointing how so many people are convinced that ending state control of currency is some magic bullet that will end oppression and allow for some egalitarian society to develop. The oppression of modern civilization is so much more *total* than that, and there is no such lynchpin. Not that bitcoin isn't necessarily a step in "a" right direction but it is merely an incremental reform: It only addresses *one* organizational concern of *one* vector of oppression - Without even eliminating or even threatening that particular vector. Bitcoin can be somewhat liberatory from the perspective of the wise and lucky individual who has the opportunity to invest in it carefully, but that is only a game being played well, and you aren't changing any of the rules. Yes, yay, a lot of us are getting rich. But christ almighty, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

Note I did not imply that slavery is merely a state of having to do work, but that it is *coerced* work: Coercion is a human act. The biological threat of starvation *on it's own* is not coercion. But another person using that threat as leverage to bend the outcome of an otherwise unrelated decision is. Self-actuated work - Work that is initiated by the person doing the work, for which they enjoy the direct benefit - Is generally joyous or at least satisfying. But coercing work taints it, turns it into what I prefer to call 'toil'. The subsistence farmer undoubtedly has other hardships facing them but 'food slavery' is not one of them, nor is that a thing.

Well first of all I didn't say that capitalism is bad. Yes, it is bad. But I didn't say that :P
I'd like to observe, that you seem to be locked into the mindset that a system has to be prescribed onto people by some sort of authority: You say things like **"the right of an individual to own and trade"**, but 'rights' are only defined by what a state or other authority *doesn't* permit people to do. Rights are just negative prohibitions. People as people do not have 'rights' as such: An autonomous person can do literally whatever they want. 'Rights' as a concept only come into play when their behavior is to be arbitrarily limited in some way. You go on to ask me what people **"should and shouldn't be allowed to do"**, but sir I am in no position to be telling people what they should be allowed to do of their own accord, especially when being asked about my ideas regarding post-capitalism. This is a total tangent, but I wanted to point it out because it indicates a lack of familiarity with non-authoritarian ideologies, where there is no central authority telling people what they can and can't do - Rather they have to (Get to, if you ask me) work it out among themselves.
  
Anyway, brief answers:  
1) What would need to change to make capitalism 'not bad'? The primary issue with capitalism is that it equates wealth to power, while simultaneously allowing for the private consolidation of that wealth, thereby logically allowing for the unencumbered consolidation of power, which inevitably leads to abuse of power. Therefore the primary issue with capitalism is private property - The mechanism of that wealth consolidation.  
2) What do people do, trade, or own in a non-capitalistic society? Capitalism on it's own doesn't allow for the doing of things, the trading of things, or the owning of things. Those concepts all exist outside of capitalism, capitalism merely tweaks the ownership part thereby altering the doing and trading parts. Personal and public properties are still a thing outside of capitalism. Exchange is still a thing outside of capitalism. *Doing things* in general is certainly still a thing outside of capitalism. Personally I consider myself a communalist, which is a left-libertarian political ideology that is informed by social ecology theory. It allows for all of those things, just not within the capitalist context.

LBC is a way to get bitcoins with cash, no paperwork or documentation required.
Reddit has shown via admin action / inaction on various occasions that they comply quietly and sometimes enthusiastically to both law enforcement demands and advertiser pressures, which I'm guessing sometimes come through to them via 'non-official' channels (Someone at the FBI has a Reddit admin's cell 
Recent example of this, 'bash the fash' comments from anarchists being removed by admins - not mods - while right-wing comments suggesting certain leftists be shot and right-wing subs that allow doxing continue to exist.
Reddit is a profit-driven corporation like any other. As such they will protect their profit streams and eventually bow to advertiser and agency pressures. This isn't a conspiracy theory, it's just how a company behaves. Not saying that it's OK, just saying that the answer to why LBC links disappear seems fairly obvious.

As an IT nerd, anti-capitalist and bitcoin enthusiast (Believe it or not you can indeed reconcile those last two) I've been absolutely loving Mr. Robot. Unlike most shows on TV, Robot's writers actually do their homework when it comes to writing the tech jargon. The dialog still usually reads like the writers did their homework rather than wrote it from personal knowledge, so it still feels inorganic at times, but it's lightyears beyond the 'I'll enhance the photo by building a GUI in visual basic' CSI bullshit that you might be used to hearing on TV.
Really though the most interesting part of the show is how it tells an almost interactive story about mental illness through fourth wall breaking and unreliable narration, it's fucking unmatched brilliance in that respect. You as the viewer sometimes feel like you're crazy after finishing an episode. *Maybe you are.*

Demsoc is 100% capitalist, just stronger regulations and social safety net. Bitcoin perfectly compatible.
As for communism, bitcoin is it exists now wouldn't be compatible as communism is an economy structured around cooperation and not competition, so the current security incentive (block reward and fees) would be gone. Some sort of distributed security like Iota might work, although the use cases would of course be different in a society where you don't buy things with cash.

IIRC, generally when there is a law concerning 'illegal' data, the legal test is the possession of that data, not the ability to reproduce that data, because traditionally possession demonstrated intent. This of course is complicated by the public and distributed nature of the blockchain, but absent an update to law to address that discrepancy we should be worried that this could be used as a loophole for entities to legally cripple bitcoin. I understand that a practical stop-gap solution like assisted censorship for those who demand it is a hard pill to swallow, but it beats the alternative of this exploitative attack actually succeeding in undermining bitcoin use in certain legally-hamstrung regions. Not to mention *actual exploitation of minors being successful*.
Remember folks, whether it's being used to attack bitcoin or being used by actual rapists: *Child porn is wrong and we should do something about it*.

This is the wrong way to react to the discovery of exploitative porn on the blockchain, and it's also an invalid analogy.
The *correct* way to react is first to acknowledge that this is indeed a wrongdoing. *DO NOT IGNORE THIS FACT*. Then point out that bitcoin is not an anonymous crypto and therefore the perpetrators of this wrongdoing can very likely be tracked down by existing law enforcement. Perhaps also consider as a community that maybe the main chain isn't the best place to store non-transactional information if it can be undermined and compromised like this so easily. Or if not that, consider censorious localized additions to bitcoin for the sovereignties which refuse to acknowledge those other facts in their attempt to find a reason to ban it. After all they're going to censor it one way or another, do it before they do so that they're less likely to format their censorship as a full-on ban.
This is an invalid analogy because even if you were to go find equivalent porn in some irrational number, the computations you'd likely have to do to *find* that imagery would probably be prohibitive. A *person* intentionally placed those images in the blockchain for a person or people to see, there is agency involved here. There is no agency in nature, only very very very rare chance, rare enough to make it completely pointless as an argument against personal agency.
Don't try to brush away or ignore this problem. Face it and deal with it.

All central governing authority is a co-opting of the distributed authority already inherent to individuals. Vertical hierarchy isn't the only way to organize groups, nor is it particularly efficient, but it's the only way that a small group of people get to make all the decisions regardless of how everyone else feels.

Oh you can *certainly* still 'make money by having money' with bitcoin - As long as your economy is capitalist. That's really IMO the point of capitalism. You can still have rich boy's clubs and wealth barriers to entry that utilize BTC instead of USD. As long as wealth = power that will happen. However BTC does certainly make the market harder to manipulate which itself could have a significant leveling effect on wealth distribution.
I like your idea (Or Andreas idea) of objects holding onto their own profit in order to make essentially public resources self-sufficient. That sounds a lot like market anarchism, which I see as a massive improvement upon capitalism. But my criticism of market anarchism is that, hell, if all your resources are public now and everyone is getting what they need, why are we still keeping track of it with currency at all?

Are you suggesting that the exploitative material discovered in the blockchain is random or by chance? Because I'm under the impression that it's already determined that the data chunks were found to be linked, either by address or time or some other combination of patterns. Also the blockchain isn't big enough yet to practically assemble arbitrary, coherent data from chunks as large as 80 bytes.
If you're suggesting that the authorities making these claims should be backing up those claims with investigations to find the perpetrators instead of ruining a covert advantage by spouting FUD, I agree.

I hate shit like this. Where do people think all that money will be coming from? Bitcoin won't be worth that much unless it actually experiences wide practical adoption as a payment method. Until then it's propped up primarily by speculation, and there's not enough investment cash to make it worth even half that much.
This is why you should be excited by practical point-of-sale tech, like BTCPayServer lightning payments. It's an early example of a use case that *can* bring that sort of value into BTC.

Just think of each increment as an order of magnitude instead of a constant value. For every notch you move up on the y axis you are actually viewing the previous value * 10, rather than value + constant. Since bitcoin's price growth has been roughly logarithmic -It's been tacking an extra zero to it's USD worth about once every 2.5 years so far - viewing it's price over time on a graph where x : y = 2.5 years : 1 order of magnitude, it looks an awful lot like x=y. Of course this pattern cannot sustain forever, there is only so much wealth value to be represented in the world, for one. And only so much that will wind up in bitcoin, for another. But I would guess it can certainly sustain for another 5 - 10 years.
PS and that always gets me to thinking. If *that much value* is moving into a digital currency from various fiat and such, what will be happening to the governments and countries attached to those value stores?

You don't have to tell me twice about how governments work, I'm an anarchist. And it's because I understand how governments work that I'm worried - When faced with even the most minor of existential threats they react violently. So I worry deeply about their reaction to a major one. Bitcoin makes zero guarantee of it's ability to extinguish *anything*. It's not as if certain elements of government don't already see this coming.

Definitions are supposed to be universal, that's their utility and their whole purpose. Two people of differing ideologies can have a rational discussion because they share common meanings behind the words they use. "Unrestricted trade between anyone and everyone" as you put it, is specifically the commonly accepted definition of *free trade*, while the commonly accepted definition of *capitalism* is "An economic system in which trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit" - Like most Americans I was raised by capitalists, who still identify as capitalists today, and that was what I was raised to understand the word to mean at home, at school, at work, and in everyday conversation. This isn't some intentional demonizing of capitalism, it's just explicitly and exactly what capitalism is.
Now, maybe you're right and this truly is a confusion of terms here, and ancaps don't actually believe in private property due to a confusion of special definitions, in which they *actually* only believe in free trade specifically. However I think it might be a bit more likely that you are misinformed regarding the beliefs of your fellow ancaps. I'm fairly certain that private property is an ideological tenant of ancapism. And that is very different from free trade, which is not specific to capitalism and does not require the existence of private property.

Or vice versa. It's intuitive to think that mining intensity correlates to exchange rate or price, but it doesn't. It correlates best to the short-term profit to be made off a mining venture due to BTC price increase. The fear that mining intensity will grow exponentially is unfounded. BTC could gain global 100% adoption and, ignoring efficiency problems with the protocol at those adoption levels, mining intensity could theoretically be completely unaffected.

It won't. I'm not a money guy but I do know math and have watched this exact graph pattern appear over and over in the BTC price for years now. It's crash down below $2000, I'm *guessing* around $1800, and then spend the next 3-4 months climbing steadily, linearly back up to $2300-2400 or so. Each of these bubbles ratchets up the price a few hundred when all is said and done, but I think of that as more of a correction of the price in steady linear phases where it perhaps increases a little too slowly. In the big picture, it seems to just be following a logarithmic line.

Any 'non-major' miner is going to jump on the BIP148 chain come August 1st. It'll have drastically reduced hash power due to many of the major players still sitting on the legacy chain, so anyone with an ASIC system or two who got shut out of the game a few years back will be turning their systems back on (If they still have them) to try and scoop up a few blocks. Doesn't matter to them what happens to the chain long-term, it could be (relatively) easy month for a few days or even months.

Yes, in aggregate I believe that is a serious consequence for a miner. I don't get why you think that wouldn't matter. Losing the BTC identity seems like it would be a serious problem to be avoided. No one wants BTU or even understands what BTU is, I believe that in the event of a chain split even around 25% of nodes running BIP148 would grow quickly to overtake the other chain's volume. I think that should also be seen as a serious incentive for miners considering coming along. Medium-sized dogs can temporarily become the big-time doggos.

@_date: 2017-05-30 19:24:53
explanation was OK but a bit long-winded and perhaps a little biased, so let's see if I can do better. Same disclaimer of perhaps not getting technicals perfect for layman understanding's sake:
**SegWit** - Segregated Witness. A package of several relatively small improvements to the bitcoin protocol that have been requested for a long time, the largest of which moves the signature data merkle tree for transactions, which is almost half of the data in a current block, to a separate storage structure (Still stored on nodes, just not in the blocks). Therefore can theoretically double block *capacity* (Not size, strictly speaking). This is what the name 'Segregated Witness' refers to. It's just an uncomfortably weird way (Seriously WTF) of saying 'separated data'. Another segwit fix enables side-chains: Independent transaction channels that are opened and closed with a single bitcoin transaction, but can contain theoretically limitless, protocol-agnostic interactions between those two events. Lightning Network is one such side-chain tech. This could increase total transaction capacity an unknown amount (Depends on the sidechain tech).
**UASF** (Not USAF, that's a branch of the US military :P ) - User Activated Soft Fork. A system by which individual bitcoin client software decides to start behaving a different way, such that the blockchain splits into two chains: One that accepts the new 'rules' of the UASF nodes and another that adheres to the old rules. This is not necessarily meant to be permanent, more meant as a way for nodes to leverage their collective decision-making power (A split is generally bad for any big money in Bitcoin). There is likewise MASF capability - Miner Activated Soft Fork.
**BIP148** - Bitcoin Improvement Proposal  BIPs are the [RFCs]( of bitcoin, and BIP148 is a proposal to use UASF to trigger a protocol change in participating nodes on August 1st, 2017, whereby they will begin only accepting blocks that use the 'Segwit' structure. The stated reason for this is that mining companies, which profit greatly from the relatively high fees associated with full blocks, are blocking mainstreamed improvements to the protocol that would increase transaction capacity and thus free up space in those blocks, and therefore have to be overridden via a UASF-driven chain split to move the network forward.
Now, to their credit the other camp (Usually referred to as Bitcoin Unlimited / BTU) are proposing larger blocks to to address the transaction limit. However larger blocks 1) Do not address the various fixes that Segwit implements 2) Will have to just keep increasing in size sans any other improvements 3) Will eventually pose a bandwidth problem to everyone except for users running out of data centers or lucky enough to have a dedicated high-bandwidth connection. They also have financial incentive to let these issues fester for as long as possible before implementing a fix, as the longer that blocks are full the longer those high fees will remain. Full(probably obvious) disclosure: I'm for BIP148, and I feel that if the miners are allowed to make this decision for us eventually their greed will get the better of them and destroy bitcoin's reputation (And value).
Well shit, I wrote just as much as @_date: 2017-05-24 18:12:23
I would assume the same, but it's gone basically linearly from 1,000 to 2,500 over the past few months so maybe the 3,000 sellers will think twice and see how far it gets before they dump. Or at least distribute the load over more than a few days.

@_date: 2015-11-04 16:44:37
Exactly. You can also not include a fee, if you like. But miners are more likely to scoop your transaction up into a block if there's a fee in it for them. Thus larger fee = Higher probability of fast transaction confirmation. Mining fees are expected to eventually replace the reward of new coins for mining a block completely, as that reward continues to half over time. [Wiki](

Well, if no one shows up to add mining capacity, the difficulty will *eventually* drop down to match. But if there's a split chain and one side has no mining capacity then trust me - At least one large company will jump ship to start making the big mining profit, even if it's only temporary.

I like the idea of bitcoin UBI as bitcoin evangelism. Also blockchain casinos (Reminds me of the idea behind government-run lotteries in the US - Vice to fund education, supposedly). If you can set up as a local non-profit in a country, I could definitely see said country (Or at least some of their citizens) utilizing FairShare as a charitable donation or international aid. I couldn't see that happening without setting yourself up as a charitable org by their local rules, though - No incentive to give without that in place, other than sheer generosity.
I like the idea of all this being voluntary, via good will. I *want* to say that you won't be able to subvert the traditional capitalist economy without a strong system of economic incentives in place to get people on board from a self-serving / personal enrichment perspective. But the idea of economic incentives is a capitalist idea to begin with, so it makes sense that the incentives don't add up in a capitalist context.

I got into a good half hour chat with my Uber driver the last time I was down there and it turned out he was a former teacher from Wisconsin who wanted a life change, which was funny because my mother is also a teacher from Wisconsin, and we connected on a bunch of stuff. About halfway through the conversation when we had warmed up to each other he asked me how I felt about Uber, and I was diplomatic but honest, and he replied that he waited so long to ask because he wasn't sure about me due to the fact that I had a *one star rating* on the app (This was before users could view their own rating). He said he almost hadn't accepted my fare when I had popped up. At that point I had only used Uber twice before, once in NYC and once the last time I had been in SD and remembered both rides as friendly and non-problematic, so he chalked it up to user error. But that was kind of weird. He promised to give me the full 4 or 5 stars or whatever, he was a nice guy and I did the same for him.
The TLC is fucking awful. I fancy myself an alternative transportation / cycling advocate and consider their lobbyist-style grip on the de Blasio administration to be one of the worst aspects of the current city government here. But I think that they also do a much better job of creating and enforcing meaningful consumer protections than any other cab organization or company does, so I tolerate them better than I do Uber.

Seeing that unbridled capitalism results in a spectrum of wealth with the majority of people on the low end and many/most under the threshold of being able to afford many services on their own, I'm one of the people in that school of thought (Except for the "big government" part, I think government should be whatever size it has to be in order to carry out those socialized functions). What would you propose as a replacement for government to provide those services?
Or alternatively, can you describe a socio-economic system where those services are no longer necessary, or provided otherwise? Very open mind here, just don't answer with "The market will provide" please. I agree with OP re: our taxes being funneled to war and the financial industry and that's wrong, but what's keeping us buying into that are the good things that government provides, even the corrupt US government. I don't feel won over by it, I feel held hostage by it. But I do view those services as necessary, at least in an economy of unequal wealth distribution.

Very much in agreement that for a vendor, PayPal is the de facto obvious choice for digital payments due to user base. But given PayPal's relatively high fees and the ease of setup of Bitcoin payments, I don't see what good reason there is for not at least providing an alternative option barring some kind of agreement with PayPal. Even if Bandcamp only does .5% of their sales with Bitcoin, that's likely tens of thousands of dollars in fees they can avoid paying.

Proudhon's phrase "property is theft" referred to private property (Separate from personal or public property), and was intentionally worded provocatively as it was a somewhat new / daring concept. It wouldn't apply to this situation, the keys to a bitcoin wallet are personal property.
If you want to implicate an early anarchist school of thought for entertaining this sort of sociopathy, Max Stirner's your man with his idea of Egoism. He didn't believe that *anything* was sacred but rather that people should do whatever they like and claim as theirs whatever it is they coveted (And that somehow after all the bloodshed things would level out). The highest form of societal structure in his concept is a 'union' of egoists - Just a bunch of people who's covetousness happened to momentarily align. Most flavors of anarchism are more structured and modest than the layman would think, when people imagine lawless anarchists abandoning all morals and taking what they please they're thinking Egoism.
Friedrich Engels knew Stirner personally and wrote this frightful little poem about him:


For the moment, he is still drinking beer,  
Soon he will be drinking blood as though it were water.  
When others cry savagely "down with the kings"  
Stirner immediately supplements "down with the laws also."  
Stirner full of dignity proclaims;  
You bend your willpower and you dare to call yourselves free.  
You become accustomed to slavery  
Down with dogmatism, down with law.  
  
Anyway my point is that thinking back you're right, as flawed as anarcho-capitalism is it doesn't really give direct platform to the idea of straight-up property theft (Egoism would). However the common and strong criticism of ancapism is that it does give *indirect* platform to such situations, since if private property is respected and central authority is not then you have a situation where those with more property inevitably have more power (As that property is capital), and therefore you have an uncontrolled power gradient, and therefore you quickly once again have centralized authority and therefore a state. Without exaggeration, it's just regular old oligarchy. The continued respect for private property nullifies successful anarchy's ability to 'level' power gradients (Functional anarchy's ability to maintain a stable non-statist state... No pun intended :P ).
I expect that what I just wrote isn't gonna fly here. Bitcoin the technology's 'killer app' so far has been an unregulated currency and that of course attracts ancaps and finance types who of course are maybe the *least* keen crowd to nullifying private property you could find, having usually made their livelihoods upon a respect for private property. But two things to remember - 1) It also attracts knuckleheads like the nut who started this sub-thread and 2) It's ability to distribute consensus has *so much more* potential beyond being a venue for exploitative power (Private wealth). So much so that I imagine almost any modern anarcho-*communist* society would also want base their communications upon it.

Yeah, most governments are 100% capable of regulating crypto use if they want.

I suggested to Bandcamp that they accept Bitcoin just a few weeks back, as they work pretty much like Vimeo does: Someone likes an artist and wants to drop a couple bucks on their song / EP / LP / whatever. Quick and small one time purchase, and almost all the profit goes straight to the artist. Their site is deliciously simple and DRM-free, lets you do full previews and everything and makes you feel great, until you check out and they made you use [*fucking PayPal*](
I tried to tell them they're shooting themselves in the foot not accepting a digital currency, and they responded that they're currently "Keeping their eye" on Bitcoin but sticking with PayPal for now. I don't understand what they stand to lose by adding Bitcoin as an option. Maybe PayPal cuts them a deal if they're the exclusive payment processor?

AFAIK LibertyX is a way to purchase Ƀ with $ at a brick-and-morter establishment, and not the other way around, and isn't set up to be an informal method of money transfer between friends. The thing I liked about Circle was that I could tell a friend "Yeah I'll spot you that $20 right now! Go on the App Store and download Circle. It's like Venmo but better," knowing that they could easily move the BTC I send them back to USD or (As I had hoped) keep it in BTC and use it to explore the currency.

Well correct me if I'm wrong here, but the case of a chain split from the network disagreeing on BIP148 on August 1st would effectively result in two currencies: BTU and BTC. BTU would look like BTC does now from a capabilities standpoint, while BTC would be the UASF nodes/miners/users, from that point utilizing segwit. Both chains would of course have the same initial histories and thus everyone would have the same amount of BTU as BTC. However, since BTC would still be "BTC", that's likely where all new trading volume would go and, because of segwit and core dev support, where new development action would also happen. I'm sure Unlimited would be quick to implement their ideas at that point as well, like bigger blocks, but I expect that due to the technical *and* recognition deficits that chain would wither away in a matter of months.

I had been using Circle for months to split payments with my girlfriend (I really don't like the idea of giving Venmo access to my bank account but the bitcoin fanboy in me caved for Circle), but when she tried to add her bank account to deposit funds I sent her, the authentication deposits never showed up in her account. She reached out to their support several times but only manged to get a canned response, and still never got the authentication to work. A few weeks later she tried again more aggressively, got a human via email and got her account added by them manually. She eventually got her funds out, but not before the price of bitcoin dipped so low that I had to recompensate her for like half of what I originally sent her, and Circle doesn't cover that kind of loss.
I haven't had a problem with my Circle account (I only send, I don't receive) and was really excited to use it to evangelize bitcoin, but I've stayed away from it since then because I believe at this point that it would do just the opposite. It really stressed her out to have her money trapped by an unresponsive company while it slowly evaporated due to price changes. I love the *idea* of Circle, but with the price of BTC still relatively volatile it's not a totally viable USD transfer option unless they implement some kind of protection against value fluctuations. I know I know, "Why move it back to USD at all?" you might say. But you'd be missing my point.

OK so hold up, two things here:
1. Segwit, by allowing transactions to exist off-chain, indirectly increases capacity (An unknown but likely large amount, tied to the success of the 'layer 2' off-chain protocol introduced, eg Lightning Network), where capacity = number of transactions per block. You are correct in this context in that Segwit itself isn't literally adding the capacity, but the protocols that it enables do and it would seem very disingenuous to not acknowledge that fact.
2. Segwit does more than just enable side chains. It is a small package of improvements of which side-chains are one item. Another thing it does is re-organize the storage of 'witness' data into a separate data store outside of the block (Thus the name). This change itself *does* directly add capacity, because it means the block itself now has more storage space for transaction data (Equivalent to 1.5MB - 1.8MB non-segwit blocks).

No you wouldn't be able to make a 'profit' without continually maintaining at least 51% of hash capacity, because you would need to maintain your lie via the blockchain in order to maintain your ill-gotten goods.
We can get a pretty good idea of how much hash power each miner has by taking a look at the current [hashrate distribution]( At the time of this comment, as long as the same person/party isn't controlling Antpool, BTC.TOP, Bixin, F2Pool, and BTCC Pool (Or a combination of smaller pools with equivalent hash rate) then we can be fairly certain that no one can mount such an attack.
I believe just a few years back either Antpool or F2Pool started getting close to 50% and a large chunk of it's users (It was an aggregate pool not a single private farm) jumped ship to other pools, since nobody invested in Bitcoin wants to be a part of it's potential compromise.

Cryptocurrency has been mentioned in Ray's scenes? Only times I've noticed it so far were during the E-Corp encryption attack, the sign behind the counter in the bodega and this quick mention of 'Ecoin' in last night's Wong scene. I noticed that Ray's "how to" sheet from his old IT guy mentioned TOR. Willing to bet he's running a Silk Road and will be a Ross Ulbricht-style character. The fact that he had to get Elliot to do this simple task for him is probably an allusion to the real life revelations that Ulbricht himself wasn't the most competent webmaster.
@_date: 2017-07-04 22:22:04
Yeah it does, but there's not much we can do about that. Market resolutions look different than consensus resolutions and we're working on a consensus resolution, designed to influence the market resolution only after a specific date.

Ah, I see. I think the safest way to hold onto the value in that case is still just keep it in BTC as most cyptos are just as volatile as bitcoin, and that volatility is almost all short-term - It almost always rises over month-long periods. Value is streaming into BTC from other currencies constantly so it's not like it'll lose value, barring some horrible event (Which of course isn't out of the question for any currency). USD on the other hand will almost always depreciate.
Don't think of BTC as a speculative investment, think of it as digital gold for long term storage. The fact that the price is changing rapidly these days is circumstantial.

It's essentially a straw pole intended only to gauge support for the next step, which would be the actual bit setting.

They might be. But one of them provides fixes under existing bandwidth assumptions, which happen to also free up transaction space, so it would seem to make more sense to do that one first to get a better picture of where to go regarding a blocksize increase.

Consensus resolution referring to people agreeing to a proposal in order to make a decision.
Market resolution referring to a decision being determined by classical economics.
UASF as a consensus decision is designed specifically to affect market factors. Which is why it's seen as a sort of override. But it's tricky do to that because market factors can also influence consensus decisions (All the damn time). By setting a date for consensus action in it's proposal, BIP148 protects consensus from market factors.

I love the idea of a reverse auction.

And the thing is, I don't even know how the network would manage to require a certain type of hardware. Somebody would *always* eventually find a way to build a specialized chip around whatever algorithm is required. ASICs are kind of inevitable.

Just providing information. I run a UASF pi node myself and am skeptical of Segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:57:03
That sounds fascinating. Are you able to describe in layman's terms how they manage to do that (Or any links to a decent explanation)?
edit - Just did a bit of reading on Cryptonight (Cyptonote PoW algo), apparently it requires about 2MB of fast memory to run the algo which simply makes it far less economical or practical to build an ASIC around. But not impossible.
edit2 - Similar situation for Equihash, hashing power tied to RAM pool.

Probably depends entirely on the channel and their internal rules, so essentially yes I believe that if whatever entity's side chain you wanted to transact with allowed it you could do that, but if you (For example) bought into that side chain account via USD, you'd eventually have to pay a transaction fee to take whatever BTC you purchased *out* of the side-chain. *If* that was the point of bringing in USD, that is. I guess a bitcoin side-chain could always be used as a BTC-agnostic ledger.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:32:06
Yes agreed with all that but when you say 'STOLE' are you talking about lifetimes of labor and human dignity stolen from billions of people over hundreds of years? Or are you talking about taxes? Because I always get so crestfallen when I hear a righteous rant like this only to have the person reveal at the end that the evil they're ranting against is nothing more than their butthurtness about having to pay taxes. It's bigger than that.

@_date: 2017-06-21 17:39:46
It was, but they also outlined the entire schedule for a Segwit2x rollout at that meeting and the first step on that schedule was this NYA thing. I guess it's just an official double-checking before moving forward, making sure all involved parties haven't changed their mind after flying home. But beyond that yeah it doesn't do anything.
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:45:44
I'm not a financial guru or anything but to me this isn't surprising and I don't think it really indicates anything interesting. A lower price of bitcoin means you have to trade more of it for the same equivalent fiat value to be exchanged. So, all other things (Like trading volume) being equal, if the priuce of bitcoin drops the trading volume in BTC will go up. If the orange line were volume in USD then maybe this graph could have potential meaning.
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:44:22
Yeah after I wrote the above I looked back again unsure. The volume line roughly follows the price line up until November so while I have no idea *what* changed, you're right in that *something* has changed.
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:37:25
Agreed, I think that some of the more corporate entities following bitcoin now comfortably understand how the technology works, and therefore can see down the road to how the tech may or may not evolve - And therefore how they might be able to manipulate and capitalize on that evolution. As we all now understand, bitcoin by design is not yet freed of the very real potential for centralized control, while there is already enough money and power poured into the currency to make that control tantalizing to those who would have it. So, we're now seeing massive amounts of propaganda from multiple vectors essentially pushing for *anything but segwit*, because that patch is a bomb that would permanently burst the current dam holding back bitcoin's capacity. Right now capacity is an additional scarcity on top of currency, and that is allowing those with lots of currency to further manipulate capacity. As the network chokes under this power pressure, the idea that any bitcoin node can fulfill any one of the network functions of bitcoin becomes less and less true. And inevitably that grip will only tighten to permanency if nothing is done soon.
Careful, bitcoin. Don't get co-opted.

Mac hardware is all very similar. If this bug was being caused by a hardware glitch I'd be impressed.
10.9 on the other hand handles memory differently than 10.8, I wouldn't be surprised if users on different versions of Mac OS see a different prevalence of this issue. I have no idea how LevelDB operates.

I don't know about the others but I know that 148 does not include a blocksize increase, nor is a BIP actual code. I mean specifically a PR for SegWit + a blocksize increase. Which I guess would necessarily be a hard fork due the size change.

That's not what *you* want. But it's kind of inevitable in a global economy where more moneyed countries rely on cheap foreign and migrant labor do the jobs that don't even pay a local living wage. Now, where does bitcoin factor into this?

Am I correct regarding the assumption that StarLink will still require ground station transceivers to bridge communications between the StarLink network and the rest of the internet?

The only difference seems to be that this will be the first satellite internet company with the bandwidth to support wide consumer use, no?

Mac OS X is built upon UNIX / BSD and as such the underlying frameworks, binaries and configuration files that drive the OS are extremely accessible and understandable. If there isn't a pretty eye-candy program to do something for you in Mac OS it's rarely a problem to just dive in and do it yourself with minimal scripting and/or porting of a project from a similar open platform like Linux. Native Windows users might feel the same way about their OS but for me, Mac OS X really does feel like it's "mine" and even when Apple decides to neuter features between versions it's generally not to hard to put them back in and get them working again on your own (Like when they killed Samba in 10.7 for instance). Basically, because it's based upon something open and well-known it's prettiness and intuitive usability is bolstered by the fact that it's a complete powerhouse.
Likewise, Android floats on top of Linux (Yes this is different but stay with me). While at first glance Android may appear to be a pandering locked-down kiosk interface like iOS, with root access you can alter config files, run cron jobs, ssh into it, and do whatever else the little script kiddie inside you desires. Yes, this makes it inherently less secure than iOS but I'm no one's grandma and I understand that the tradeoff for extensibility and power is responsibility for one's own security. I prefer that because I demand at least $500 of usefulness from my $500 phone and for me usefulness entails far more than the simple ability to sync my mail and share my family photos with the NSA. I want to model in 3D, I want to download torrent files, I want to program in Java... I want to transfer bitcoins!
Basically they're both great user interfaces that allow you access to the underlying architecture so that if you're a nerd like me you don't get frustrated with arbitrary limitations. When I use iOS and Windows all I see are arbitrary limitations (That's not to say that those two platforms don't excel at certain specific uses).
