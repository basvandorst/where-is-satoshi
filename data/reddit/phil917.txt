Hi there, did you ever get this issue resolved? Thanks!
@_date: 2018-09-20 00:01:59
How much do ya earn per day on average?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:58:31
Can someone explain the significance of this? Is this going to help solve congestion and high fees?
@_date: 2018-09-13 00:29:43
That's it folks, the bear market is officially over!
In all seriousness, Heiken Ashi candles just showed our first green candle on the daily since that last big dump. I think we probably going higher at least for the next few days. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:34:06
I'm sorry everyone :(
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:58:25
Haha I certainly hope so!

I think we should just agree to disagree. This is all my opinion, so again, please feel free to block me so you don't see future posts from me.

I agree that it's impossible to know the future with 100% accuracy but it's fun to make educated guesses. As I stated earlier, my videos aren't me saying that anything is definitely going to happen in the future. I'm just stating opinions in my videos.
Again, no one is forced to watch my videos and if you don't like my content, feel free to block me on Reddit and you'll never see another one of my posts again.

Hi there, thanks for watching my videos. I just want to clarify, at the end of the day I'm only human and just giving my opinion based on my reading of technical indicators and patterns. No one has the ability to predict the future and even the best professional traders are wrong a lot of the time and I'm by no means a pro trader. 
I say in all of my videos that I'm not a professional nor am I giving out financial advice. I also always tell people to consult with a real financial professional and to do their own research before spending or investing any of their own money.
I like making videos about Bitcoin and I like watching the markets move, as well as predicting their movements. Some people like my videos of me talking and ranting about Bitcoin and various things in the crypto space. And some people don't.
That being said, no one is being forced to watch my videos. I've noticed you commented on a few of my posts and you don't seem to like my content. So perhaps you might consider blocking me on Reddit so you don't see future content from me?
Either way, if you do keep me unblocked, I hope you like my future content.

Thanks for the feedback :) I did mention another pattern in there but I wanted to keep the video nice and short. I'll try to add a few other indicators next time to bolster my point.
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:56:50
Thanks for your feedback.
@_date: 2018-05-11 03:39:46
When it comes it's going to be crazy
@_date: 2018-05-04 01:31:19
Thanks for the support!

Glad ya liked!
@_date: 2018-05-21 23:58:02
Definitely a strategy you should consider over lump sum investing
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:13:20
Thanks for the feedback. I'll try to elaborate on the bearish scenarios a bit more in the future. In this video I essentially paid lip service to the bearish case and focused on the potential bull case.

Hey guys, I just started a new YouTube channel dedicated to crypto, The Crypto Authority. I'm trying to differentiate myself from other crypto channels by not shilling the coin of the week, or contributing to pump and dumps. But rather, giving a more level headed look at the markets and various cryptocurrencies as well as informational videos.
I just posted my latest video and would love some feedback: 
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:04:47
I made a video discussing why 2018 can still be a bullish year for Bitcoin and crypto markets in general: 
Hope someone finds it insightful
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:05:36
I already did ;)

I don’t recall it ever being explicitly said before by the SEC which definitely left a lot up in the air.
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:33:02
Things are going to get crazy when that happens
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:44:56
How come?
