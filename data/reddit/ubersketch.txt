I wasn't trying to be insightful or wise but I didn't decide to add my own post to this thread offering my insight. 
You didn't answer his question and it deflects from the issue that should be being discussed in this thread - *how long does a transaction take and how much does it cost? Is it practical to use this in every day situations like buying a cup of coffee?* The answers to these questions for bitcoin are: transactions cost to much and take to long so no it is not practical to use as a currency for normal small purchases like buying coffee. 
Telling people that they should use fiat instead for small every day purposes deflects these objectively shitty facts about bitcoin. It implies that there is a place for a bitcoin that doesn't really have any practical value and that its okay that the fees are as large as they are and transactions take as long as they do. It also implies that bitcoin was not intended to be a replacement for fiat currency, which it absolutely was, adding more confusion to an already confusing topic. 
But you are right, I didn't answer the question so here you go. As per [this website]( which tracks the mempool and current fees/estimated transaction times.


For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 149,160 satoshis.
According to current prices 149,160 satoshis = ~$22.9 USD and with the current state of the mempool, it is estimated that this transaction would take between 0-25 min to be confirmed by the network. So lets be generous here: **using median fees, your $5 cup of coffee would cost ~$28 and it would take around 15-20 minutes for the business to get the money. To be fair, you could use lower fees but this would result in your transaction taking EVEN LONGER** It is indeed not practical to use btc to buy a $5 cup of coffee, but this isn't a failing of cryptocurrency it is a failing of bitcoin specifically.

This is a useless comment, you don't even attempt to answer the question
