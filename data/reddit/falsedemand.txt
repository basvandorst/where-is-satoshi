The figures have been published by the OECD etc . It's their calculations not just some finger in the air figures.
It stands to reason. poor people do not have any fiat therefore cannot buy crypto.  I cant give exact maths on it , but its right up there with common sense.  If you have no money you can't buy anything including crypto.  Therefore they only people that can buy crypto are those than can afford it.
These are 12 years out of date, and i am sure you can get more recent figures which show its even worse today :
In 2007, the richest 1% of the American population owned 34.6% of the country's total wealth (excluding human capital), and the next 19% owned 50.5%. The top 20% of Americans owned 85% of the country's wealth and the bottom 80% of the population owned 15%.
According to statistics put together by BitInfoCharts through parsing the blockchain, of roughly 23 million Bitcoin wallets in existence, more than 13 million of them own only a fraction of a Bitcoin. While many in number, they make up a minuscule portion of the overall financial landscape.
At the other end of the scale, only 1,500 addresses have between 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoins in them. The top 111 wallets have more than 10,000 Bitcoins a piece. 
The 100 largest Bitcoin wallets are together worth $28.6 billion.
Using BitInfoChart’s latest calculations, 87 percent of all Bitcoins ever mined are owned by just half a percent of Bitcoin wallets. The figures only tighten from there. 61 percent of all Bitcoins are owned by just 0.07 percent of wallets. That’s an incredible amount of wealth in the hands of very, very few.
Whilst I agree some of those wallets are owned by exchanges it does give a picture of the distribution of wealth (in BTC)

Oh there are much better stocks to put money into.
But your choice was Amazon or Crypto.  I think the answer is both, but one is the investment and one is a speculative punt.  I don't see btc price moving "very much" this year and I certainly don't see it hitting the highs of 2017 any time soon.  But I like everyone else just has their own opinion, I could be way off the mark.  If it does go up, my opinion is wrong but my btc wallet is smiling.

A bit like when they introduced the Euro.
Prices in different shops in different countries were massively different, to begin with and settled down.  But just like a pint of milk can cost different prices in two shops in the same city.  It's a combination of supply &amp; demand and what the shop keeper/employer can get away with.
It took years for people to stop comparing prices in Euros Vs Franc or Euros Vs Deutsche mark but nowadays I doubt many people even think twice about it.
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:24:51
But when you have a world of 180 currencies there is always going to be failure. Its the law of averages or something.  Pegging against the dollar - with hindsight - was never going to end well.  In fact has not ever ended well with any currency (although I think there might be  couple still pegged)
 You could argue thats not the failure of the currency but the failure of the people in government making poor decisions.

Where did I say bitcoin was bad?  
Read the bloody article : 
How can the distribution of wealth be meaningless?  
The majority of the world’s digital currency is owned by just a few thousand wallets even if you take out the exchange wallets which you can see by the transactions going in and out.  However a vast majority are dormant and have been for years therefore they are more likely to be individuals.
The hoarding of wealth by a slim number of wallets gives those owners incredible power. Like stock traders, if the largest Bitcoin wallet owners decided to cash out, it could send prices tanking, leaving the much smaller investors concerned about what to do with the rapidly dwindling value of their own holdings.
I gave you the OECD USD distribution figures albeit 2007

No you have to find someone to swap fiat for BTC but it’s better than using PayPal where the payment can be recalled . 
For small amounts to strangers I think it’s a viable option 
@_date: 2019-01-14 15:38:44
Sure I agree with you, there are some wallets that hold vast sums of btc and cover thousands of customers.  But that also suggests that each customer doesn't own very much bitcoin.  I stand by the fact that wealth distribution in btc is no better than in fiat.
"Using BitInfoChart’s latest calculations, 87 percent of all Bitcoins ever mined are owned by just half a percent of Bitcoin wallets. The figures only tighten from there. 61 percent of all Bitcoins are owned by just 0.07 percent of wallets. That’s an incredible amount of wealth in the hands of very, very few."
If an exchange is holding huge percentages of the mined btc then its not very decentralised.  Conbase is just a bank holding peoples crypto.

You are spot on. I tried to convince my mum and dad to buy a bitcoin each back in October and keep them as an investment for my twin nieces for when they turn 18 (in 16 years time).  For them, it was beyond complicated.  
If I had been there to show my dad what to do it would have been different, I am sure I could have held their hands through the process.
They ended up buying  2 x100g bars of gold.  Actual physical gold that they had delivered to their home and is now stored in a safety deposit box (in a bank)
My dad told me how simple the process was and it was much easier than buying Bitcoin, which genuinely saddens me.
There must be someone on here who is far more programming/tech savvy than me that could replicate the ease of buying gold in crypto.  
@_date: 2019-01-07 08:46:46
It's a MINEFIELD.  There are a few operators and they have different options.
Some will pay you a monthly fee for effectively renting space in your shop etc- they do all the work and all you get is that monthly rental fee (it's not very high, maybe $100 per month plus electricity and internet fee)
Some on a revenue share basis but you have to load the machine with cash etc ( you earn a  per transaction fee)
Or the full service where you rent the machine and run the whole shebang - but that is a legal/compliance  nightmare,
When I looked into it I found it overwhelming tbh. I wanted to open a Crypto shop - that had Crypto ATM's, a coffee shop part and a place where people could work.  But on paper, it didn't seem that profitable.  It would have been cheaper to set up a crypto bank teller desk where people could come in and buy Crypto rather than waste the money installing machines.
@_date: 2019-01-16 16:43:50
Personally, I would buy direct.  Not bothered its twice the price, I would pay the extra just to have more peace of mind that I hadn't bought some knock off Chinese or North Korean or Russian fake.

MANY thousands of people who get scammed from their bank accounts follow basic common sense rules, and STILL get scammed. The difference is they get their money back from the banks.
Look at all the people on here who are pretty tech savvy or understand crypto more than the average Dave on the street who come on saying I think I have been scammed.. had my btc stolen.  
"might as well keep their money in a can." and that's why crypto will not become mainstream for decades and decades.    I don't know what the answer is, I wish I did, but crypto security needs to be more secure than a bank account, somehow.
Maybe F2A incorporated for any address or wallet which requires the F2A to confirm the transaction.

But then on a case by case basis ( basically if you go the the newspapers or onbudsman) they will probably refund you.
What is interesting is now the UK had open banking protocol, now that screws everyone who sigs up to a third party service, because they are gaining access to your data - ok its only read only.  but still its access that goes against the banks T&amp;C's
Lets just agree is a fucking minefield lol
As I said the regulator ( particularly in the UK) are slow to make changes to protect customers.
Victims tricked into transferring cash from their bank to a fraudster's account may be reimbursed from next year under new rules to tackle a surge in so-called 'transfer scams'.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) today backed a range of measures to give consumers greater protection from 'authorised push payment' (APP) scams.
These are when unsuspecting customers transfer money from their own bank account to one belonging to a criminal. The lost money is then quickly transferred to numerous other accounts, often abroad, and then withdrawn by the crooks.
Some £101 million was unwittingly handed over to criminals this way between January and June this year, new figures show, but only a quarter of this was recovered by banks. Of the 19,370 cases in this period, 88% saw consumers lose an average of £3,000, and the remainder were businesses that lost on average £21,500.
City regulator the FCA acknowledged that not enough is being done to protect consumers from this type of scam, which can often bypass a bank's security and sees fraudsters deploy sophisticated trickery such as posing as police officers, bank staff or solicitors – and even involve sending fake invoices.
With the PSR the FCA is calling for a new system to reimburse scam victims, which must be in place by September 2018. At the moment, banks can decide whether or not to refund lost cash, which often depends on whether they consider the customer has been negligent or not and whether they can recoup the funds.

THIS is an excellent case study of how bitcoin can be used to great personal effect.
Crypto WILL NOT replace fiat, but can be used alongside it.  It should be a bit like a relationship - you are pretty good on your own, but get together with someone and as a team, you are stronger &amp; better.
This is how they control the flow of money out of China, my feeling is they will wise up to it at some point and try to put restrictions or controls in place.

NO I am not saying ALL wallets = people.  However common sense tells us that MOST wallets can be attributed to individuals lol.
Take out the big wallets with lots of flows in and flows out.  YES they are exchange wallets.  but what about the wallets where nothing has happened for ages (they hold most of the wealth).
Read this article by the FT.  Its not just the FT that is saying it either.
I love bitcoin as much you you probably do, but I also can see past the steam in that one of the things bitcoin hoped to achieve - democratise finance is on the face of it nonsense.

	Overall, some 1,600 bitcoin wallets — managed by both speculators and investors — contained at least 1,000 bitcoin each in April, according to Chainalysis, collectively holding nearly 5m bitcoin, or close to a third of the available total.
Now you can tell me those wallets are not individuals?  they certainly aren't pension funds or corporations holding onto it for the benefit of the many not the few.

You are correct :
"square takes a cut of all transactions processed using their system" 
and you are correct : 
"you'd just be adding a middle man to the peer to peer network "
That is one of the biggest barriers to mainstream adoption (amongst a plethora of other barriers) 
One solution would be to charge a monthly subscription for using the system rather than a transaction fee.  You could have a higher monthly fee depending on the volume of transactions or total transaction value.
Overall a per transaction fee would generate more money but monthly fees would be a consistent revenue stream.  Easy from a forecasting PoV

PayPal do not like bitcoin.  Numerous chargeback cases have been created by scammers who buy Bitcoin with PayPal from and then claim they didn’t receive anything. 
But you can sell your BTC on Coinbase and then transfer to Paypal.
If you are looking to circumvent exchanges then it gets a bit murky due to the scammers (see above)
I wouldn't follow any videos on youtube that say they can help you buy or sell crypto.  99% of them are some sort of scam to get your coin.

I think that money would be better spent lobbying corporate retail companies to adopt the technology.  Or spend the money providing the technology to enable it.
No point having a big campaign for people to buy crypto if all they can do is sit on it afterwards because there is nowhere to spend it.
There is a bit of a chicken and egg situation with it, but I do think until some big companies start accepting it its a slow grower.
If Amazon suddenly said we will accept bitcoin, then that a game changer, and probably a 20% price spike in all crypto.  If it accepts btc then the other crypto will ask "hey why aren't you accepting us too" and then its a snowball effect.
I have read that some in the cypto space are hoping Apple will start accepting it, but they have ApplePay, and if they were to choose to accept a crypto I think it would be far more likely they would choose Monero purely for its privacy

I am sure Adobe, Sony, Target, Equifax, Marriott, British Airways, and Yahoo have amazing security, spent millions on cyber security. It doesn't mean they cant or wont be hacked.
From a hackers PoV its far too tempting not to have a go, when there is 900+ BTC "laying around"
Ok MT Gox was a pile of shite in the way it was built and its lack of security, and Mark Karp was way in over his head.  but hackers will always try to find a way and the law of averages means Coinbase have to be lucky everyday, a hacker needs to be lucky once.

I think having fake PayPal accounts are every anonymous and they are pretty easy to set up.  And scamming their system doesn't take rocket science.
I understand what you are trying to say, but I think describing bitcoin as anonymous is a touch misleading. I remember when the subreddit darknet markets was around and people were convinced bitcoin was anonymous.  If you compare bitcoin to Monero in terms of anonymous bitcoin is like having a flashing light on your head as you run away from robbing a bank.

But look at who the unbanked are now.  They are the poorest in society, most often those in the poorest countries that have limited reliable electricity, mobile networks and internet.  The internet revolution hasn't even come to them yet, they are not even on dial-up. 
Re the article you attached .. Going to blockstreams website :" Anyone in the coverage area with a small satellite antenna and an inexpensive USB receiver can receive these blocks and ensure that their node is always in sync."
So now the poor person who can't even afford a mobile phone  and doesn't have reliable comms or electricity has to spend fiat on equipment so that he can ditch fiat for bitcoin.  That is madness come on. 
Bitcoin has a long way to go to solve the issues of the unbanked.  If anything, right now, it put more barriers up.  I am not sure how the blockstream technology works but I presume you would still need  some internet connection from your wallet on a mobile phone to make a transaction?  I dunno without reading through the technical docs.
Don't forget the unbanked probably mostly do not have mobile phones( same issues no mobile network or reliable electricity)  so where are they supposed to keep a bitcoin wallet?
I am sure in 5 or 10 years the technology may be there, but right now its pretty flakey at best.  Bitcoin is ahead of it time.

You are taxed by the rules of the country you live in (your home country) .  Living in Europe "for a couple of months" doesn't constitute you being a resident.  Just because its crypto doesn't mean normal country taxation rules don't apply.
You might end up being taxed twice or worse being accused of money laundering or tax evasion by your home country.
When you "cash out" where do you intend to keep the fiat? In your European bank account or your home country bank account?
You need to read up about how your own countries tax rules handle overseas income. You will probably find your good old government will be waiting, rubbing their hands getting the tax you thought you could avoid from it.
As a side note: it also depends how your home country view crypto and whether they see it as a taxable asset. (I would suggest that in a few years every government will, just so they can get their grubby hands on your profit)

There is a lot to digest from this. Appreciate the effort you have put in to write it.  I am an American but have been living in Europe for 15 years, so I totally understand your hatred for The Donald.  It feel it too albeit from a distance. Trust me Europe has its own issues with "mini trump fuckups" all over the block.  
I buy bitcoin for investment.  I want it to sky rocket.  But I am also a realist and can see that it does not and cannot solve the problems people feel against their governments or heads of state etc.
Its not the system or the currency that is the problem its the people running the system/ currency."And extreme widespread bankruptcy would break the ceos, and the US government, and its military" Who would be hit the hardest by such a thing?  The poorest in society, workers, pensioners whos money is invested in these companies..  The CEO's wont give a fuck.  They will be fucking of their their properties in New Zealand and away from the madness.
When you peel back the layers the ones hit the hardest are the ones your mind wants to protect.  You think fuck the dollar will fuck the CEO's and the govt.  When in reality it fucks the ones you are hoping to protect.

Yeah from what I have seen the exchange rates are shockingly bad.  I think to do a one-off novelty trade just to say you have done it.  Using them regularly is like pissing money up the wall.  There are better and cheaper ways to get coin.
I guess if you are laundering money then you don't give a fuck about the exchange rate - during old style money laundering you would lose between 30-50 %, so changing cash to bitcoin at an ATM then putting that bitcoin through an exchange as clean money is probably much cheaper than 30%

I take your point and I do agree with you to a degree.
But I also think that if Big Dave and his wife were to buy BTC and they were to get hacked or robbed of it, that would be the end of BTC for Big Dave, his wife, his family etc etc.   It will have a ripple effect.
Its like that saying " you have one chance to make a first impression"
bad experiences would have a negative impact (for the average person).
Its only the diehards that lost money from MT Gox or some other hack, got phished etc and STILL believe in BTC  that keep coming back for more.  Yes we learn each time, but blimey it can be a costly learning curve.  The average man or woman in the street would not keep coming back for more.

localbitcoin but depending on the amount you want to buy  they may ask you to do a little dance, shag your nextdoor neighbour and provide indie leg measurements

It took Fiat currency hundreds of years to become: 1% owning more than half the wealth in the world. its taken 10 years of bitcoin to have 1000 addresses owning more than 85% of bitcoin in circulation.  Think about that for 1 minute.  
I love all things crypto and am invested in BTC and a few others, but you have to take the blinkers off and realise it is not the panacea replacement of money and all things bad in the world. Certainly not for the next few generations. Bitcoin is being corrupted daily - look at the price -  that will give you an indication.

Personally, anything financial (anything from online banking, to exchanges even my mobile phone contract) is set up on a different email address to my everyday email address.  I never log into that email account on a computer I receive the emails on my iPhone. F2A enabled and as secure as possible.
That way if my everyday email account is compromised somehow they wouldn't have access to anything financial. 
F2A has certainly saved you. Remote access sounds plausible but you would be able to find that app running in task manager. Malware would have to be more than just a keylogger, especially if you have F2A on there which doesn't sound plausible unless its able to ghost your screen ( unlikely)

Yeah decentralised exchanges are (I think) what Hal intended, which is the only way round KYC.  However is you go on Bisq there isn't that much activity. Please just don't seem to want to use it.

Agreed but 100 is a great round number plus its easy to work out how much its worth in fiat lol

This is the yellow vests THIRD attempt to start a bank run.  Trying to start a bank run at an ATM (which holds max 120,000euro ) is just hilarious.  This just demonstrates how this "movement" do not have a clue what they are doing.  ATM's run out of money all the time, it doesn't cause a crisis in the banking system. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 08:16:18
190 hours?  That's very specific.  try bisq you can buy 1 btc per day from the get go.

"you clearly have much understanding on how the financial world works" the only factually correct statement you have made today.

I think its an extremely grey area, and they authorities have been crazily slow to put measures in place so its not a grey area.
European banks are in a similar situation.  The US bansk pay out because they wont stop using text messaging confirmation of transactions despite it being pretty easy to spoof.
I don't understand why banking transactions cannot be confirmed within the banking app you have on your phone.  It cant be be spoofed and its all kept within the banking eco system rather than relying on unsecure text messaging.
Banks can generally only refuse a refund for an unauthorised payment if:
it can prove you authorised the transaction – though your bank cannot simply say that use of your password, card or PIN conclusively proves you authorised a payment
it can prove you are at fault because you acted fraudulently or because you deliberately, or with ‘gross negligence’, failed to protect the details of your card, PIN or password in a way that allowed the transaction
Still as I said, even if its 50% refunded thats 50% more than crypto.

"Fiat has already collapsed." Blindly ridiculous statement. Of the 180 fiat currencies show me actual evidence that they have all collapsed.
I will wait.
Crypto ISNT going to solve your issues with your government , the sooner you realise that the better.  
It is nutcases like you that actually are a detriment to  crypto gaining any mainstream traction, because not everyone takes your stupid militant "anti government' views and puts the normal person in society off even opening their ears to crypto.
@_date: 2019-01-22 11:06:48
"Especially if fiat eventually collapses" I roll my eyes at bullshit comments like this.  It's not going to happen.

“It's not 'pissing money up the wall', that's complete bullshit.” 
It is though if the average man/woman on the street is using them regularly and getting a shit exchange rate.
Would you rather buy 1BTC on an exchange for $3500 or buy 1BTC at an ATM for $3800 ?
Hint: one is pissing money up the wall and one isn’t.

Satoshi's wallets have not changed and no bitcoin has moved since he died in 2014 (therefore never will move or "dump" his bitcoin)
he was cryogenically frozen but I am sure he had his mnemonic written down somewhere just in case when/if he comes back to life he can't remember it.

It would probably work out cheaper to get a safety deposit box at the bank.  But then all you are doing is putting your keys (your money) into the hands of banks yet again. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 14:37:58
I like the concept of crypto but I think we are well away from it being mainstream. For that reason, I am in it for the money. My only regret is not being involved back in 2010.
In my day job, I trade currency and then HODL bitcoin with some of the profits (and sell on localbitcoin) - Most of the people I sell btc to are looking at it from a profit POV.

Yeah so people just turned to SR and due to its nature also had unethical, untrustworthy and potentially violent criminals selling their drugs.  I think if Ross hadn't been caught when he was and SR was still running (can you imagine) I think the rise of Fentynl (sales) would have eventually led to a  backlash and or a bigger sentence for Ross and public demonisation of him.
His sentence is ridiculous but I don't see him as a hero, maybe in the beginning the SR idea was a good one, but ego and power make people crazy.  I don't for one minute believe he was innocent or set up and a people on here referencing [ \- well that whole thing is laughable, there is so much actual evidence that has been skewed or omitted to produce this.
My own opinion is that the DEA etc should have just got him on charges of money laundering- given him 40 years and that would have been the end of it.
At the end of the day there are 3 sides to this story. Ross's, the governments and the truth. The first two we have heard over and over, the latter I am afraid, we will never know.
Sorry I have been banging on longer than I thought I would. One final thought though.
With the calamity of the leader "The Donald" (Trump), the talk is he might pardon Ross.  If you had said this to me a year ago I would have laughed.  But with recent events and "The Donalds" recent decisions - I would not be surprised if he goes and does just that.
@_date: 2018-12-28 11:55:00
Yeah, cash out for sure.  I mean who believes in this bitcoin crap anyway.  Plus the banks are paying such amazing rates right now, you could become a millionaire just in interest in say 10000 years give or take a few.

Not to mention the people who bought bitcoin at the end of 2017 hoping to become RICH and turning out (as of today) to be poor.
Bitcoin or cash or a shitcoin, it's  human mentality that ensures they are all the same regardless.

Not saying the mystery whale is going to dump.  But if I had a big stack of btc I would do the same, move it into nice manageable amounts just in case.

I find it very hard to believe that someone of your means has to come to Reddit for ideas.  No offence.  I am sure it was more than just luck that got you your bitcoin wealth, so I struggle to see why you wouldn't be able to find some local good causes etc.
If however you are feeling festive, I am always happy to accept a bitcoin or two and do something worthwhile with. LOL
@_date: 2018-12-24 17:50:36
Good job you didn't think this 365 days ago.
Yeah December 2017 throw all your cash into bitcoin.
Wow roll on 365 days........ ouch that would be like having your own recession nevermind the global economic outlook.
If the housing market slowing and a couple of hedge funds winding up are the best economic indicators we have then we are all doomed.
I am not saying you are wrong.  In fact, I think the US economy is more resilient than you give it credit for.  However, there are some anomalies mostly Trump related as no one can predict what he will say or do next - not even the Donald knows what he is going to say or do next.
Events that could push US into a recession:
Trump/China  Trade war.  
People realising they don't have as much money as they think they do.
Zombie companies going bang ( those that borrow cheap money to run the company and make it look profitable) cheap money via higher interest rates becomes more expensive, zombie companies start going pop. 
More likely is Europe hitting a recession first: they are fucked as they cant do much with interest rates as they are too low now.
UK is possibly knackered due to Brexit (if it actually happens) that will have an impact on the eurozone economy too.

Yup. Two separate things.  I trade currency for my day job, some of the profit from that I buy BTC and HODL. but I also sell some BTC on localbitcoin when people are happy to pay over the odds.

NO. Tell someone 12 months ago that holding his/her savings in BTC was a good idea. I mean everyone loves a January sale but not when it's your life savings that just discounted by 80%
Until the price of bitcoin is more stable using btc for international money transfers is only a good idea if the person receiving converts to fiat the day you send it, (so the prices doesn't move too much - even waiting a day could leave your recipient) 5% or 10% down
