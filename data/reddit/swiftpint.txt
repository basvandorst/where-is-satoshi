I feel like vechain would have hundreds of cheerleaders but would just sprint through without even bothering to pole vault 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:27:32
Pass the guac! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:06:11
They've said it will be post only for at least an hour. After that who knows.

If you're in the UK, the cheapest way to transfer to coinbase/gdax is using a SEPA transfer. Your bank will probably try to charge you £15, but services like Revolut are free and pretty quick. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:21:06
I don't understand, why today? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:04:21
I mean, if you buy 1btc Gemini and Sell 1btc on Gdax (assuming you already hold on gdax) you will be holding the same number of btc as before, but will have spent $15.6k on Gemini and will now have a balance of $17.6k to withdraw from Gdax. = $2000 profit. 
This needs for you to already have accounts set up on both, and to already hold on the exchange which is 'overpriced"

Someone prep the lunar lambo
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:22:17
Worth mentioning that method will give you Euros on coinbase/gdax
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:04:38
Insane. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:44:43
Emphasis on cat
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:13:12
Did we just have a pump and dump? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:31:15
You need a steep trajectory to get to that moon
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:12:57
Exactly.  Consider hedging your bets and moving it in chunks over time in case of any price fluctuations.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:04:48
14k looked good yesterday! 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:38:35
Hodl me, I'm scared.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:06:27
Does this mean that BCH will go to the moon as soon as you sell it?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:27:17
You can transfer funds from coinbase to gdax
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:53:25
I like how we've have a $4k crash but it's still up 23% I'm the last 24hours.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:12:16
That's for tomorrow...
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:23:30
Down down!
Looks like there could be some good buy opportunities 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:36:47
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:00:37
It's about to deck out isn't it?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:43:44
Screenshots of your private keys.

When a stock (or in this case bitcoin) gets overpriced vs what it realistically worth then a correction will occur with the price dropping down to a more realistic level.
With stocks you can do various analysis based on earnings etc to work out what you think a stock is worth and therefore determine if it's under or over priced. This is trickier with bitcoin so it's hard to say what price a correction would end up at. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:36:07
If you happen to have coins on both, buy on Gemini, sell the same number of btc on gdax = $$$
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:36:26
What about other exchanges? Are folks abandoning gdax after the bch fiasco? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:16:04
It's BS, you could have physical gold delivered to your home quicker than getting a btc transfer confirmed. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:30:25
Woah! Thar she blows! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:22:10
Agreed. It doesn't seem to want to drop below 7000 at the mo
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:56:14
Similar. I've only got BTC and BCH. I sold some BCH to buy BTC about 12 hours ago.  Wish I'd held out a bit longer though. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:25:07
Cool, thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:47:41
So much for the moon. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:51:43
Same. Hodl ftw
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:23:05
As Five so accurately predicted, you gotta get up to get down. Luckily in BTC the opposite is also true. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:06:45
I'm worried we are going to freefall to the bottom of the uoow
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:58:26
Only if it is a really good girlfriend 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:37:51
So I understand correctly, is this wall showing the number of folks wanting to sell at 7000?
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:11:24
Recycling like a boss
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:57:25
I thought he meant for bitcoin to be used for transactions, the first line of the bitcoin Whitepaper says:
A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:40:34
It's all over the place 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:09:36
That's a pain man.
Prices are messed up at the moment, every time I look they've swung by 100 one way or another 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:54:49
Straight to the bottom of the uoow
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:36:48
I'm gonna make like Glen and Hodl
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:07:43
Or we might just bounce around just under the 7500 mark... 
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:38:34
Yeah, I see it breaching new highs today.
