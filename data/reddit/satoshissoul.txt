Hey friends of unfakeable and permissionless money!  
**We would like to inform you, that on our Website:** [** **you can find 500+ Restaurants, Supermarkets, Bars, Shops and Hotels accepting BTC!**  
100+ of them are using the POS of ANYPAY which supports BTC  
150+ of them are using the POS of ELIPAY which supports BTC  
The remaining 250 also mostly support BTC payments and have a wallet ready to receive your bitcoins!  
Actually  I have not met any merchant yet that would not accept BTC, but I do not  want to make you any promises, because depending on the tx fee that  might happen...  
Just today I on-boarded a new merchant here in  Caracas, Venezuela and then just 30 minutes later someone appeared and  paid with BTC!  
He paid $11 for his food with a tx fee of $1,44  using the Coinomi wallet, he said he likes to use BTC because he has no  trust at all in Roger Ver and believes that BCH is highly centralized...    
**Enjoy the website and go spend some BTC at these merchants!! Most of them keep their BTC!!**  
**We also have 2 Android Apps and an upcoming IPhone release which promote all these places:**  
Our app Coinector is focused on beautiful images of places close to your and the listings are sorted by categories.  
[  
Our app Bitcoin Map is focused on the map feature, Coinector also has a map, but not that beautiful...  
[  
All  our software is open source, as we would like to offer anyone to  improve on that software if they would like to add any kind of feature  or release something similar.  
I wish all the best to the BTC community and I hope we can overcome the ever lasting conflicts between the BCH and BTC camp...  
**We support all the bitcoins! Because we respect the work that was done by the BTC team, without that, BCH would not exist...**  
Roger Ver is not BCH and I wish he would step back from the media, he is damaging the reputation enormously...
