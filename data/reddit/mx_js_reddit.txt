Are you at least hedging with other cryptos like Ethereum, iota, etc? To be prepared for a flipenning? 
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:24:09
Its not true bro , people make up data for up votes 
@_date: 2018-09-19 18:33:44
IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN !! all things pass their prime eventually 
Was december 2017 bitcoins prime???? 
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:25:14
It doesnt matter, its like Back in the 90's china endorsing Internet and you own a piece of google.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:46:19
im getting hard
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:49:28
thats what they call replay protection, exchanges and wallets invested a lot of time preparing for the fork and to be ready to separate between btc and b2x so we as users can treat them differently even though they had the same adress, and same blockchain at one moment
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:23:22
My main concern would be, does their seed is compatible with other walllets 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:29:58
a major major pump like last week? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:40:47
You are right, bch is the same technology but with a little tweak, question is , will core update soon or too late? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:36:13
im just waiting for a better bcash price and then dump it for ethereum, the wait until civil war is over
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:54:10
this will pass, lets wait for CME future contracts and more news and adoption ( like TBBT bitcoin episode)
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:28:10
yep thats what happened today, but that panic sell was under 10% when gains have been over 50% only in one month. it only reinforced the idea that bitcoin is here to stay
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:31:51
do you understand whats really happening?
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:45:23
Afford to lose means youll be fine And move on with your life even if worst case scenario happens And you lose everything,
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:51:01
probably a miner
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:58:52
wallet recovery services
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:59:33
for whom?? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:56:43
what does it mean?
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:11:45
in a recession you want to protect your money from further depreciation or stagnation. you need a deflationary commodity like gold, like digital gold
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:24:58
yes, just like Bitcoin cash, segwit was going to use the original blockchain of bitcoin to fork it into a new currency (B2X) and all the owners of bitcoin would have received B2X by default since their adresses full of coins are on the original blockchain. Their intention wasnt to give away free coins, but to gain enough traction to replace bitcoin entirely, then they would be known as BTC and the one that we have would have to be named BT1 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:59:00
If you add the valué of both it has never gone below 7000
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:10:55
what does it mean
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:47:22
Aparently security issues may arise with bigger blocks 
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:51:23
I would. Buy 50%bitcoin 30% ether and the rest iota, walton or some coin that looks promising 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:58:54
We are now a charity 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:53:08
forget about current drama, invest and hold. unless you want inmediate returns, in that case look elsewhere, where you are more knowdlegable and have more power to intervine
bitcoin is the technology of the future
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:13:30
i would switch to ether, 
its crazy out there
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:44:35
theres a bit of a crazy war over btc vs bch, having the saame amount of coins(not funds) on both is the safest.. but do as you please.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:38:26
me too, this is such a circle jerk on bitcoin being the future of money, 
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:22:34
Electrum started as an answer to the “mybitcoin” wallet scam, it has over 6 years on the market 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:22:17
   Only if you consider flash rise to 7800, it only lasted a few hours 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:41:19
What will happen is that difficulty is going to follow the price, so you are subject to market manipulation, if someone has millions to dump and connection to miners ( ahem Rog Ver) the other coin is going to sky rocket.. and then miners will follow price etc..
the best thing is to own same amount of coins on both side of the chain ( not same amount of funds) and wait for this war to be over some day
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:39:54
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:32:14
yes we knew, yet hash power dont care about politics, only profit, 
fire up a pump, miners will follow, weak hands too, and you have flippening v2.
its only a matter of when rog is going to do it, hes got the money.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:26:53
it can, it got to .68 the other day in some exchanges.
core and cash might be in agreement ffs, you dont know what happens behind curtains
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:53:10
really? 8% down in 5 days and you think is more than correcting? have you seen the meteoric rise? just zoom out a little....
Actually i would not be surprise by a 50% correction, that would be meh..
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:23:32
This crazy war only affects those who bought after the BCH fork, or those who are all in on one of the two.
The winklevoss have both coins cause they have coins since before the forh, hence if one goes to zero and the other one wins, they are still rich.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:27:01
Yeah just a couple of hundreds of millions, practically nothing 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:46:20
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:14:32
yep, but the flippenning can happen any time, las saturday was a proof of that, you only need a big whale to fire up the exodus...since both coins compete for the same mining pool, we are all in the hands of big whales
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:45:20
core thinks that bigger blocks are a security risk, apparently it is some old satoshi rule
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:37:50
is it?
@_date: 2019-04-23 02:36:48
You do look like a bitcoiner
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:07:24
Lol its at.58 in bitso (Mexico)
@_date: 2019-04-23 02:35:37
Sure... fomo is real,thats why we are all here.
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:09:52
no value other tan continuing to run the bitcoin block network which is a lot of value by itself
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:44:30
Pretty simple downward push,  since miners sell their new found bitcoins to survive ( pay electrical bills) and there are not enough buyers. IIRC market needs to absorb like 6-10 million dollars daily depending on the price.
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:08:03
why dont we have more of this  common sense comments in this sub
@_date: 2019-01-14 18:18:17
when the dot com bubble hit thousands of people lost money, but just months before that, many tech gigants were buying infrastructure like crazy, over doing it thinking like almost everyone that the bubble was only going to get bigger and bigger.
..It didnt.
  
But that overdone infrastructure was a big part of why adoption grew so fast.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:07:19
LOL IT ALREADY MOONED ITS FRIKKING 9000 A PIECE!!
That doesnt mean it cant go higher but crypto has ALREADY exploded
@_date: 2019-05-25 06:07:54
By the time your bitcoin investment hits 300usd youll thibk you are a genius and Will start to research house mortage in order to go all in on btc.
Dont
