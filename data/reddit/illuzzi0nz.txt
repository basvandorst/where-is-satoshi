What happens if the site disappears? How simple is it to retrieve your coins, Since electrum 2.0 has been getting "updated" for near a year? Could the web wallet be accessed securely over the TOR network as well if you wanted to?
@_date: 2014-11-29 14:02:18
Thanks I will take a look.
@_date: 2014-12-12 10:13:53
oh thats interesting, I've not read up on bip38 wallets yet.
@_date: 2014-12-22 04:10:28
Does trezor not use a web wallet?
@_date: 2014-12-15 08:56:27
Just so you know virus scan suck ass, Most R.A.Ts and key loggers are undetectable by just about all anti-virus programs for a while until they are updated, And then by that time the virus could have also been updated to remain undetectable.
@_date: 2014-12-12 11:05:40
yeah but at the moment doesn't it really only have support for an online wallet unless your tech savvy enough to get a beta version of electrum installed on your computer?
@_date: 2014-12-12 10:59:29
Looks like mothafuckaJones aint such a motherfucka after all.
@_date: 2014-12-14 10:23:07
Just curious what happens when all 21 million coins are mined? Since miners will not have anymore incentive to keep going what secures the network then?
@_date: 2014-12-12 09:44:36
But the steel wallet keys could have been copied when being made? Unless you of course made them yourself.
@_date: 2014-12-22 11:20:36
That definitely sounds like they have not even dropped it off yet.
@_date: 2014-06-23 06:19:07
That a bitcoin atm?
@_date: 2014-10-11 08:12:33
word, is spread
@_date: 2014-11-29 13:32:54
I've seen some stuff about the trezors, isn't it an online wallet though? You can only access the coins through there site right?
@_date: 2014-12-10 04:47:29
Do either of them offer a .onion alternative? And would a hardware wallet such as H.W1 work with coinkite?
@_date: 2014-12-15 13:32:48
Id also do some digging on your other computers also to see if you can find anything on them, it could have attached itself to a file you may have transferred between them or something. Sorry about the loss of your coins though.
@_date: 2014-12-06 13:34:57
At that point not really, he'd have coins, all he needs to do is create an account an have something sent to his address. But this shouldn't stop him from letting his son learn about bitcoins
@_date: 2015-01-03 11:51:03
Sure he's super glad you showed your tits to everyone on reddit first. Whats this have to do with bitcoin now?
@_date: 2015-01-12 07:56:36
Apple is very strict about what they let people put onto there apps if they want to be released on the app store, I highly doubt they would have been able to do anything like that and get it past them.
@_date: 2015-01-30 05:32:09
Yeah this seems really dumb for something that holds money.
@_date: 2015-01-30 07:12:10
99% of people wouldn't know why there looking at 12 or 24 random words written down. If you are that worried just try disguising it as something else.
@_date: 2015-01-26 06:27:45
bread wallet would be so much better if it wasn't using bits or had an option to change.
@_date: 2015-03-28 03:25:04


Those are still bullshit anyway since they have something like 100 years to pay it back, id say you would never see a cent.
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:43:46
You are a special kind of stupid aint ya.
@_date: 2015-03-26 03:39:56
Was it some kind of scam attempt at you or something? This post only makes you look like your being a dick to a potential customer without any context.
@_date: 2015-03-07 06:31:17
You seem to have the best prices out of all the other sites that do this. If you used smaller glitter I would definitely buy a few.  
@_date: 2015-03-19 08:25:59
oh shut the fuck up already. Your acting like shit like this doesn't happen on the normal business side of bitcoin. Remember Mt Gox? He also dipped out with everyones money and funny thing is everyone knows who he is already. And nothing happened. How many other exchanges got "hacked"? It can happen anywhere, get off your high horse.
@_date: 2015-02-01 10:05:00
Doesn't look like the iOS version has that.
@_date: 2015-03-03 05:02:25
No one is going to be able to brute force your passphrase. Unless you remember that last word, your coins are gone. Its kind of the entire point of the passphrase. It would be useless if it could be brute forced easily.
@_date: 2015-03-04 21:14:20
Short answer: Yes
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:12:07
Making it a less useful option then using bitpay and getting an address to just deposit into without needing to log in
@_date: 2015-02-11 15:22:37
Cant seem to install the trezor plugin on a mac yet though.
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:52:16
Thanks a lot that got it working.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:25:48
So if you don't use a passphrase this attack would work? You guys should do the friendly competition, if the endgame is making both more secure.
@_date: 2015-02-01 11:16:43
Oh wow, that sounds pretty cool. Hopefully they can implement something like that for the iPhone crowd, I'm wondering if it has anything to do with how strict apple can be with what they allow code wise?
@_date: 2015-03-07 06:39:21
yeah, I'm looking for the pixie dust type shit that is just specs.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:15:41
Now if you lost the trezor and recovered your seed on a new one will using one of your passphrase still recover and open the wallet?
@_date: 2015-02-18 08:57:57
How high of a volume where you doing before you got this notice?
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:56:50
What info does this machine require if I wanted to sell coins?
