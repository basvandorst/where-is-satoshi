Yes. It was open and I was connected to 30+ peers two days ago. Since then something happened and I can't seem to get the port open again.

I cannot figure out why my port 8333 remains closed, when the port is clearly forwarded correctly on my router.

Wow! I'm sure sweating now. I hope I can get my coins out.

Good job only cashing out half. After 3 years of holding, I cashed out half at $900 in 2016, and then promptly said fuck it and cashed out it all. I did this mainly because I was really spooked about how difficult it was to recover my coins from a deprecated Armory wallet that was untouched for a few years. I spent the next year actively avoiding the charts and telling myself I did well to make some profit and it was the responsible thing for a student with no income to do. It stings to consider how my apathy got the best of me after those years of determined holding. I am back in the game now with a proper hardware wallet and enthusiasm to boot. Even decided to give GPU mining a go.

You're not alone! I was also addicted to pot, held 20 BTC, sold in 2016 to cover some outstanding student loans, and missed out on the 2017 cypto boom. I'm slowly buying more now, replacing that regret with the joy of owning bitcoin once again. It's strange to feel anxious when the price goes up, and happy when it dips, but that's where I'm at.

Just bought directly from Ledger and it was $120 CAD with shipping.

I just took a photo of the docs with my phone. 2-3 days verification. No problems. CaVirtex.

Thanks for that! Made my donation. Bitcoin is so great :).
