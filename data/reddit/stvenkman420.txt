"locked into limbo" does have a rather negative connotation.  Upgraded is a better term.  They are "Up-chained"? to perform on a faster playing field and return to the main blockchain once things settle down and speedy transactions are no longer needed.

Great article on the redundancy of legacy payment processing of credit card companies.  Liked the observation that the blockchain is an extension of another invention from the 70s; the database.  The major improvement being the use of said database tech as a networking protocol.  This tiny difference means massive improvement in payment settlement as it is now automated by the protocol itself.  
No need for credit cards now except for their original designed purpose.  Extending a credit of capital was their sole purpose but the internet allowed for payment and settlement over vast distances.  Credit cards became a necessary part of the culture as the internet became more important in our day-to-day lives.
Anyways, cool article that reminded me of the content of this sub a few years ago.

As an old hat, this is normal.  Bitcoin is a protocol that by it's very nature threatens much of the status quo.
Don't give up.  There's a lot of information out there and if you'd like to avoid the current civil war I would recommend going back a few years and listening to podcasts and watching youtube videos that were published earlier than 2015.
You will see a lot of enthusiasm and commentary on the utility of the protocol, all the cool software programs that are trying to use the protocol in new and interesting ways.
"Invest" only the same amount you would for any other trivial thing in your life.  A few of my friends buy only $10-$20 occasionally so that they can play with it.  Settle microtransactions without having to use credit cards, etc.
And if you come to realize that you're not that interested in the protocol you can still sit with us old school adopters on the sidelines as we laugh at the new spectacles as they unfold.
At least bitcoin is never boring.

It can be implemented in both ways you have mentioned.  It's simply a protocol that everyone adopts.  If you are learning I highly suggest the Bitcoin whitepaper as everything is planned out there.
Or, if you find reading white papers as boring as I do, you can look up the past episodes where [Bitcoins and Gravy]( actually read through the whitepaper in segments on the show and talked about all the little technical details while also being pretty entertaining.

I cannot stress this advice more!  Purchasing power of the dollar is a strategy that is incredibly simple and successful for small time investors of the stock market.  Set aside an amount you can afford to "love/invest" every week or month and buy however much bitcoin you can get with it.
Bitcoin is divisible so you don't have to buy whole coins.  Just setup a recurring buy order with your preferred vendor for the amount you can afford and set it and forget it.

This reminds me so much of the US postal service.  
The US Postal Service is a massive operation that set out to link all Americans with the ability to communicate across large distances when it was created.  Flash forward to present day and they still provide this service relatively cheaply.
But much more important that just that, they offer an alternative to the the private boys (FedEx and DHL) which keeps them a little more honest and grounded with their pricing models. *Even though some believe those private party prices are still too high!*  This is the importance of USPS's presence in the marketplace.  
What we are witnessing is the lack of true competition in the market place.  I should be able to find someone who can move a very tiny fraction of a bitcoin and not have it get suspended forever in a monetary limbo because its too small fry for the big boy mining interests.

Think of burning as a way of removing bitcoin forever.  No one can ever use this bitcoin again. period.  So this would be utterly pointless unless something else was being created.  A new and different crypto coin was created while the bitcoin was destroyed.  Ok, so now we imagine a "transfer" of value.  1 bitcoin gave was sacrificed (removed from circulation never to be used by anyone again) in order to birth this new coin
So you say, "So what about your new coin?"
Well here comes the imaginative part.  Value for the new coin is perceived to be the exact value of the bitcoin that was sacrificed to birth it.  So critics cannot point to the new coin and say to it's developers, "you can print an unlimited amount of your new coin so its worthless"
The new coins are perceived as rare because it takes the destruction of an equivalent amount of bitcoin to create them.  Seemingly this would mean that the value of each new coin should be equal to the price of bitcoin.
Of course, this is all market perception because you can just as equally deny any value to the new coin and accuse it of removing a valuable segment of the bitcoin protocol.

The protocol represents freedom from government backed banking cartels.  This is not some cool video game or an incredible word processor.  It represents separation and freedom from fiat economies that actively tell people its ok to spend their entire lives in debt.
