Possibly, I'm just dreaming of a system where the average user could  easily install Bitcoin Core along with these other applications. I have a VPS node running on Ubuntu, but it's not really that easy to set up. I guess that when the pruned node option becomes available I can get one running on Windows really easily without worrying about disk space. If I could install Open Bazaar and Enigma as plugins in a similar way to Chrome plugins, for example, it would make adoption of these other exciting applications much more widespread.

Not sure, but this is in their FAQ:
How is this secure? Haven’t you heard of IMSI-catcher? What if I get hacked?
SMSwallet operates on a shared responsibility model and multi-factor authentication for security. To protect the SMSwallets from spoofing, the SMSgateways sends a challenge back to the phone to verify the request. Then a transaction is constructed and signed with the SMSgateway’s private key. The input(s) to this transaction is not spendable without the signature of both, the gateway and the web-service. For large value transactions, the web-service initiates a voice-call with the client to verify the client's spending PIN. Once successful, the web-service adds its part of the signature and the transaction can be spent. Throughout the process, the client is required to verify the possession of the phone as well as the knowledge of the spending PIN, giving him two factors for authentication. In other words, IMSI-catcher would be ineffective in spending-PIN protected transactions.
However, in the current MVP implementation no shared responsibility model is implemented yet. The gateway is dumb and the web-service has to be fully trusted.

If you're a big winner with bitcoin but still crave the libertarian ideal of completely anonymous money, then fund the development of Darkwallet, Darkcoin or Zerocash. One of those will become the money of the underground if bitcoin can't deliver that vision.

What do you think about the energy usage of the Bitcoin network? I know that scaled up, it would use less than the current banking system, but if there was a consensus algo that didn't use much energy at all, surely that would be much more preferable? Especially if Bitcoin scaled massively.

Because of the fixed number of coins issued, Bitcoin will eventually be a deflationary currency. Whether that's good or bad is open to debate, but more worrying to me is the strong deflationary consequence of lost coins.
Couldn't the protocol be tweaked to require coins to be moved every certain number of years otherwise they become void and introduced back into the system via mining? Then, we would have a relatively stable number of coins in circulation.

It does look like London is pulling ahead as the major Bitcoin hub unless NY and California relax their regulation. The current government and central bank have approached cryptocurrencies with an open mind.
London likes to be known as the world's financial centre and does not want to lose that accolade. In fact, I'm sad to say that finance IS pretty much the British economy. However, I'm hoping that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general can "automate" the financial industry and remove many of the middlemen that cream off large profits at the expense of the wider economy. Finance should be a small part of a healthy economy, not the size it is now.

Surely payment channels could be used for paying for coffee or other items. Just set up channels with Starbucks or Costa or any other coffee shops you use.
Even for small vendors, payment channels could be seen as a kind of loyalty system as customers may actively use them once they've bothered to set them up.
For small value single items, shops could just tag the items (perhaps with a QR code) on the shelf and customers could scan them and pay with their phones. By the time they come to the checkout, there may already be a confirmation.
I'm sure there are better ideas than this, but even now, I don't really see a problem with zero-conf.

Not sure that the mining idea is that great though. There more devices there are mining, the higher the mining difficulty and the lower the payout. Would the devices come with 1.3 GB RAM to enable a pruned node? I doubt it. More likely they'll communicate with a mining server at 21's HQ.

You could use a VPS. I don't know what the best deal is at the moment (try looking [here]( but you'll need at least 50GB storage (60GB+ to be safe for the next 6 months or so), 1GB RAM and unlimited bandwidth.
I use weloveservers and paid $19 for a year for 30GB - this offer [may still work]( but you'll have to get two 10GB addons to make 50GB (2x$1 per month) to accommodate the growing blockchain. Of course, when Bitcoin pruning is enabled, storage won't be such a problem and that may happen in Q2 2015.

I don't know if it's likely to happen, but the best outcome for Bitcoin would be the collapse of the Chinese regime. If significant money did start moving into Bitcoin then a knee-jerk reaction to band Bitcoin by the Chinese government may cause Chinese hodlers to sell. However, if the government loses control, then such laws will not be abided by, especially if the currency hyperinflates. Then again, it would be easier for them to buy and hodl dollars in that situation.

A snippet:


Barclays, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are among the big investment banks to have begun exploring the potential of the “universal register” technology that underpins the digital currency as they look for ways to apply it to their multitrillion-dollar books of complex financial derivatives.
Banks have become interested in using the block chain system used by bitcoins that make it nearly impossible to create fake units of the digital currency, meaning that brokers and their counterparties could create a real-time record of who has what trade with whom.

Yes, perhaps the term is misleading, but it's exciting (and perhaps worrying at the same time) to think of a company (in this case based on gambling) that can just exist without any human management other than at its inception.

Is there a way of getting around the SEC rules by pledging bitcoins to a cause, but instead them being used up, or receiving equity, you just get - at most - your original stake back.

@_date: 2015-02-10 11:39:30
You could have sidechains that handle varying transaction sizes. Bitcoin itself could be used for really big transactions, but small payments like a cup of coffee could be handled by a sidechain. This side could also have a protocol that allowed fast confirmations like some of the altcoins do. It would only need to sync with the Bitcoin blockchain every minute, ten minutes, hour or day, depending on the number of transactions it processes.

Would anyone here be upset if BTC didn't become the new global currency, but instead the Bitcoin protocol underpinned the global financial system? Not just as a conduit for money, but also as a ledger for accounting, law and many other applications.
I'd say that would be a huge win.
It therefore doesn't really matter about scaling bitcoin to cope with hundreds of transcations per second, as sidechains with tailored currencies for micropayments or stealth payments could flourish instead.
The fact that Dell now accept BTC in more countries doesn't really excite me much now. I'm more interested in Blockstream, Factom, Proof of Existence, Omni, remittance companies and all of the other applications that are springing up.

Banks create money when they lend, as long as they have licences to do this (from the government), they'll be fine. P2P lending is deflationary (i.e. no new money is created). The governments won't allow much P2P lending (despite what they say) otherwise it will crash the system.
Bitcoin is another story though. It is outside the current fiat money system.
