I think that's the OP's point: when the cost of power is nonzero, there is some incentive to save power by not mining when the reward will be low.

I'm going to be submitting a MintCoin &lt;—&gt; BTC escrow service… And, come to think of it, it wouldn't be too tricky to tie that into MyGox's API, so it could simply buy BTC from MtGox at whatever the current price is, then send them off… Mmm…
@_date: 2011-06-28 23:05:52
For now, we're only targeting sellers who know that they want to accept Bitcoin, but don't want to go to the hassle of setting it up.
@_date: 2011-06-28 23:02:15
Sorry guys, it looks like transactions are just taking a long time today (an unrelated transaction I initiated almost an hour ago still has zero confirmations).  Looking at  it seems like there's a lot of transfers going on, though, so it's not *too* surprising that small transactions are taking some time.
@_date: 2011-08-09 17:44:06
Ah, alright, I missed that. Thanks.
@_date: 2011-06-29 15:00:55
It might be possible, but it would require a lot of work on the store's end. Right now, we only take care of issuing unique BTC addresses and notifying the merchant when a payment is confirmed.
**Edit** because I'm replying to comments too early in the morning: oh, do you mean like a brick-and-mortar establishment? I'm not sure what service we (or, really, anyone else) could provide that would be more useful than simply running Bitcoin.exe and maybe printing QR codes with BTC addresses. If you ctrl+f kneaders's comment, maybe you're looking for the same thing he is?
@_date: 2011-06-29 14:59:35
The front end is App Engine, then I've got a small back-end (just Python + WSGI) which talks to the Bitcoind.
@_date: 2011-06-29 15:01:02
Thanks! We hope so too ;)
@_date: 2011-07-12 20:23:30
… so? Plenty of domains have their real contact information hidden.
@_date: 2011-05-17 05:00:17
Cool. Where does your data come from? Polling? Or the WS API?
@_date: 2011-06-28 17:43:47
Ah, thanks for reminding me. I had PM'd her, because it wasn't quite public then, but I'll post there now.
@_date: 2011-06-28 23:01:01
Half? By line count and functionality, you wrote way more than that :P
@_date: 2011-06-29 14:58:50
Nope. I'm not part of Willet, but from what I understand, they have two thoughts on this: first, they expect sellers will be selling primarily digital goods with a marginal cost close to zero, so the only time “stealing” will hurt the seller is if it results in lost sales… And I don't believe there are many people who *might* pay $1.00 for a product but steal it instead. Second, there is going to be fraud in any system, so the system might as well encourage fraud where it's cheap (eg, fake accounts) instead of where it's expensive (eg, at the credit card processing level).
@_date: 2011-08-09 14:44:19
Can someone tell me what's impressive about this? Looking over the page I just see a bunch of nmap results and whois lookups… Did I miss something?
@_date: 2011-06-28 22:19:19
For what?  ? Nope — none there yet (although Google does secure your authentication, so your bitwillet account could be hijacked, but your login credentials won't get leaked).
I suppose it's also possible for someone to MITM your connection and supply their own address… But that will be fixed too once we get a cert.
@_date: 2011-06-28 17:13:17
While I'm not nearly as convinced as some that it's “doomed to fail”, I'm certainly not making any long-term bets on its stability. However, in the mean time, I think it's a really interesting ecosystem which is fun to play in… And I would like it if it sticks around.
@_date: 2011-06-28 21:21:13
She is  the friend who I built it with :)
@_date: 2011-06-28 23:06:44
It won't be free forever ;)
Once we know how well it works, and we've ironed out any bugs, then we'll start charging.
Initially we'd rather deal with people who don't trust us because we're free than people who are pissed off because we aren't free and don't work :P
@_date: 2011-06-28 17:45:31
I've just released a project that might do what you want: 
Maybe that will be helpful? If you need some help getting setup, let me know.
@_date: 2011-06-28 20:10:06
Awesome! Let me know (PM or email, david if you have any issues.
@_date: 2011-06-29 02:38:05


The difficulty with that is that, when it's slow, even one confirmation takes a long time (today it was taking almost 1 hour), and when it's fast you'll get two or three in the next block.


We'll be implementing that soon :)
@_date: 2011-06-28 19:43:59
There is example code in Python in the docs  (sorry, you need to be logged in to see that… Bug++), and I'll bang out a PHP example… at some point.
@_date: 2011-05-16 16:06:42
I threw this together because it's something I wanted.
Possibly other people will find it useful?
@_date: 2011-06-28 17:11:05
@_date: 2011-06-29 14:52:38
I can see how people might get upset about being charged, eg, 3%… But for our particular business, we'd need to charge a higher-than-normal fee because we'll primarily be dealing with low-volume, low-cost transactions (ie, because if we were dealing with higher volume or higher cost, the seller could just duplicate our service).
@_date: 2011-06-29 15:08:31


What are you thinking for retail and service based businesses? How would you imagine it working?
I read one story about a coffee shop (or similar) that accepted BTC using a QR code + Android app — that kind of thing?


Unfortunately, for small transactions, it was more than an hour yesterday… And, yes, I completely agree: before BTC can really hit mainstream, we'll need to find some way of dealing with slow transactions.


What do you want to know? If you ctrl+f AES you can see where I posted about the crypto BitWillet is using.

You can have multiple items, but you've got to create a new offer for each one.
This offer system does have some limitations, but we felt that the limitations were worth it because they let us get *something* out more quickly.
@_date: 2011-06-28 18:59:03
Hhmm… Sorry, I didn't fully think through her use case.
If her only hosting is blogger, this might be more difficult with our current service.
@_date: 2011-07-19 04:59:48
So little in comparison to what? One BTC bought anonymously with cash is worth $25 to this fellow in Portland, in the same way that a cold bottle of water is worth $1.50 if you're thirsty on a hot day, but only $0.25 if you're buying them in bulk from Costco.
@_date: 2011-06-28 18:56:25
You're entirely right to be concerned.
I've got a background in CS, and I'd be happy to show you the encryption we're using.
* App Engine and a proxy which speaks to the Bitcoin daemon share a secret key
* This secret key is used to encrypt (256 bit AES-CBC plus SHA256 HMAC) all communication between App Engine and the proxy
* Attack vectors are: replay (eg, if someone intercepts, for example, a “transfer” message, it would be possible for the to make that exact transfer again), stealing shared secret (no idea how secure App Engine is).
* Since we forward the payment on to the merchant as soon as we receive confirmation, the “worst” that could happen to a merchant is they could loose a few individual sales.
Here's the crypto module I'm using:  (of course, even if this is correct, it's possible that I'm using it incorrectly… But you'll just have to trust me on that).
@_date: 2011-06-29 15:02:45
We're going to be working on that (a status link) next :)
@_date: 2011-05-16 19:33:59
haha thanks :)
@_date: 2011-06-28 22:57:26


I thought about this, but BitWillet would need some way of generating unique addresses which could get to the seller… Otherwise, if it only had one (or a few) seller addresses, it would have no way to know who actually made a payment.


At a high level, yes… But once you start getting into the details, I believe you've actually got to know a fair bit about what's going on.
Just for example, some cryptosystems are vulnerable to [chosen plaintext attacks]( so if you're encrypting or signing things, you've got to know if the algorithms you're using are vulnerable to chosen plaintext and the steps you need to take to mitigate it.
@_date: 2011-06-28 21:31:53
For your own future reference, I wouldn't even trust someone who has a general CS degree, even if they have taken a class or two in cryptography. Implementing a properly secure cryptosystem requires an incredible amount of knowledge about every different algorithm and input being used. Just for example, about six of the eight PyCrypto (the library I'm using for crypto stuff) examples I found were somewhere between “mostly wrong” and “entirely wrong”… And that's with my rudimentary knowledge (a graduate level course, plus lots of reading on the side).
Just another example of the complexities involved in systems: take a look at the Wikipedia page on [block cipher modes of operation]( Each of the six different methods has advantages and disadvantages, and there are (AFAIK) reasonable uses for at least thee of them.
@_date: 2011-06-28 23:08:10
Ah ha! Someone finally read the page!
(although, yes… We should have made that more obvious :( )
@_date: 2011-06-28 23:04:47
Unfortunately that's tricky. We'd need some way of figuring out which customer initiated which transaction… And to do that we need some method for generating new addresses in the seller's wallet OR we'd need to pick unique amounts (eg, you might pay 1.1231 BTC, while I might pay 1.1233)… And neither of those solutions are ideal =\
@_date: 2011-06-29 04:04:36
Yes, as you say, unfortunately the stock Bitcoin client doesn't support messages yet… So we can't consider them for now :(
@_date: 2011-06-28 23:43:35
For (1), it's actually surprisingly difficult to get the address you're going to be sending from. I don't believe it's possible to do from the normal client UI (but I might be wrong?), and it's certainly impossible to do if you're, eg, sending from your MtGox account (you can do it using the JSON RPC interface, though).
For (2), I didn't think you could do that if you're transferring to a Bitcoin account… Can you?
@_date: 2011-06-28 21:54:23
Down at the bottom of the page we say that it's free for now, but we'll be charging once we're relatively confident that everything is working. I'll make that more prominent, though… Thanks.
