Where did you get your information from? There are no pools in NXT (although balance leasing is a somewhat similar idea) and no entity controls 100% of block generation.

Taxes? I assume you don't pay capital gains taxes on Bitcoins in Germany/the Netherlands? I'm thinking of moving to Berlin to save on taxes.

Even if this is true, we wouldn't know which transaction a miner saw first. 
Punishing miners based on things they should have known, if that is what you are advocating, is also much more complicated than the normal way Bitcoin works, with hashes and confirmations.

Bitcoin works with the assumption that everybody works with their own self-interest in mind. As rational actors the miners should prefer transactions that have a higher fee, even if they are double spends. So 0 confirmation transactions assume that miners don't do this.

Maybe you personally monitor the network, but I don't. If I wanted to know, I would have to trust you. This is different if the transaction has been included in a block, because I could look at the block.
Saying 0 confirmations is fine is almost like saying we don't need the blockchain.

That sounds like we should trust the miners and punish them later if they misbehave. This undermines the idea of Bitcoin as a decentralized system.
Who would even know which transaction the miner saw first? It could claim it saw the double spend transaction first.

You should read the article you submitted. KYC information is collected for transactions above 10000 euros. They are not banned. That's what it says.

Having a law doesn't mean "they" collect KYC info from p2p transactions. It means the parties of the transaction are legally required to do it. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 13:52:21
No, if you are willing to give KYC information to the exchange. Most exchanges already require it.

I have developed trading systems for years, so this sounds interesting, but I didn't understand the concept at all. It encrypts price data, but preserves its "structure"? How is it different from normal price data? What is this structure it preserves?

That prediction of a crash was made when bitcoin was $400. It has gone up since that. Today the same person is predicting the price will rise.

I remember at least one Chinese Bitcoin exchange owner saying Bitcoins can't be used to buy stuff legally in China. It's becoming difficult to believe things I read on this subreddit, because there is a tendency to only write things that are positive for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-06 10:53:39
You are the one who said Bitcoins can legally be used for purchases in China, and I don't believe you.

They offer a service to add money to prepaid cards: [coinomat]( It doesn't work with all cards.

Here's a rough estimate: 0.1% of the market cap/day.

WTF? Your coins are gone.
