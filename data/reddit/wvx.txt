Same, great suggestion but I keep getting 403 errors.
edit: nevermind, unrelated user error because of non-familiarity with local customs.

I honestly don't know. Maybe if you offered something in exchange, some service or product or item, [bitmarket]( could be of use.

The only time you absolutely need to use a client is when you want to send coins. Rest of the time, no great need for it.

The bitcoin to mooncoin rate is fixed so aren't they already "pegged" to the dollar the same way bitcoins are?

One pretty general way of doing it would be like this I think.
((Your hashrate) / (Network total hashrate)) x (Blocks found per hour) x (Reward per block)
Result should be your theoretical earnings in BTC/h.

Are you sure that is what this is? The network hashrate has increased from just under 8Terahash/s to 12½Terahash/s in about 6 hours.

After looking at it for a while I think that's why it's [MHash/s]·4.32·10^12 instead of [MHash/s]·8.64·10^12.
4.32·10^12 represents half a day and half a day is what it will take on average...?
Edit: That is sure to be wrong! This is so confusing :)

Sure, at slush's pool you create your workers and use "username.worker" as your username in the client to connect. Here it was simply "worker".

I mainly get my information from these three sources. Am I to assume they all use the same faulty algorithm and if that is the case might you point me to a more reliable source?
*  &lt;- The off algorithm.
*  &lt;- The same algorithm or independently flawed?
*  &lt;- Graphs which show about the same results as the above two charts with a bit of delay.

After looking at [this chart]( I'd say the 6790 because they seem to give about the same hashrate (when overclocked, mind you).

Mining is what makes transactions work in a secure way and the 50BTC one might stumble upon when mining is (merely) the current incentive for people to mine and thus keep the bitcoin economy alive. Did I get that right?
@_date: 2011-06-14 02:55:59
I smell resentment.
@_date: 2011-06-13 10:13:54
What is the meaning of efficient here? Does not all mining, be it in a pool or solo, theoretically yield the same result given enough time? Mine solo and hope to get lucky enough to get more blocks than one might expect for the time spent or mine in a pool and get a safer averaged out result (the bigger pool, the more average). Do you mean "lucky" instead of "efficient"? I would appreciate an explanation if my understanding of these things is wrong.

I don't quite understand how that calculator works.
    var r = 905.245542526*hspeed/567358.22457067;
If hspeed is the user hashspeed and 567358.22457067 is the difficulty, then 905.245542526 is supposed to be what?

Then I take it you do resent those unsuccessful gambler(s) who (in most situations are required to) make it possible for a gamler to actually be successful? I see no point to such a spiral of resentment and acceptance.

If [Bitcoin Watch]( stats are to be trusted (the conversion rate between hashes and flops at least) the bitcoin network currently have ~100PFlops/s.
@_date: 2011-06-15 02:32:35
It'll all work out nicely in the end methinks.
@_date: 2011-06-15 01:39:53
Hence "current incentive" :)
@_date: 2011-06-14 11:30:31


Clearly not.
