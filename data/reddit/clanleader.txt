I'm diversified, and this shit with BTC is holding all other coins back in the entire cryptosphere from the bad reputation and constant war with BCH. Why can't the dev team just find a solution, here and now, to reduce these high fees and be done with this nonsense? I get it.. a solution is in place apparently.. but for idiots like me paying $20 at the lowest setting in our wallets.. it's just not working.

I think these people are agents my friend, they are too smart to be this stupid. Try and not let them play you. Some of their comments are hilarious.

Well said. It's a great thing. Let them keep shooting themselves in the foot until the masses wake up and get rid of the old system.

How can anyone defend this blockchain when it has $20 fees and still, as of now, nothing currently implemented fixes it? I'm not a BCH fanboy, just a concerned investor in the cryptosphere.

So you actually believe the posters here are being paid by someone to shill?

What is a bitcoin friendly bank? Example please?

You must remember though that other coins have far better tech right now. If BTC falls into obscurity for an entire year, that may be the end of its brand recognition.

Well done sir... well done indeed

I honestly don't buy the store of value argument for a moment. It wasn't the original intention of bitcoin, and the fact this is even considered as its purpose shows to me incompetence in the team if they've even mentioned those words. They need to be replaced if they have.
This is the Internet after all, and other altcoins have shown much better transfer and scaling tech.. the reality is that as much as BTC is the King, if it becomes a "store of value" only, the project failed miserably with its intentions. We need to all take a step back and just look at our own words as a community. A store of value is a joke. A good leader and a good team will fix this. Perhaps it's the current team if they actually believe in BTC being a cash replacement like it should be. It does not have a future if it can't do that.

How about providing balanced counter-points to the BCH arguments? The issues they raise are very valid, Bitcoin is currently slow and expensive, BCH is not. Perhaps BTC is better and this is just an illusion since BCH is not widely adopted, however with all the fanboism and hype in this sub it's hard to tell.
I have no idea either way, but I'd prefer most posts here be of a technical nature explaining how these two current issues (speed and high fees) plan to be fixed. I think most retail investors would eventually.

Perhaps you're right. But some solution needs to happen eventually. I'm not accusing the team of incompetence since I'm not well versed enough in the code.. but if there isn't a strong leadership to fix transaction times and expensive fees one day.. then it's only a matter of time.
