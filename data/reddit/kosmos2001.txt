Until Bitcoin has mass adoption, there will be no stability in the price. There's very little holding the price up.
@_date: 2018-01-14 08:38:31
If people stop buying BTC for short term gains then it has to be bought only for currency purposes (or people wanting to invest early hoping it will explode in the future).
If it works as a global currency which can handle far greater adoption without grinding to a halt, the price will go up.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:02:50
keep buying, HODling and telling other to join in
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:21:39
ok. But for example, an original work of art is valuable (not the copy). And works of art are seen as investments.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:46:28
if it goes back down to 10k that means half the people stopped using it - Bitcoin death
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:20:02
not for an exponential increase
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:00:48
indeed. Just curious...
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:32:12
people thought it was expensive at $1000
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:55:32
I'm curious to know if more people are buying or just the same people buying more.
If it's the latter, then that's not a good sign
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:31:38
so they're probably helping to let people know about it
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:56:26
Bad news for the price, surely?

Yes and you do see people moving back into painting.

Presumably the transfer is between 2 banks. Have you checked with the banks?
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:22:44
Not exactly. I'm saying that if you can't protect your work because it can be copied infinite times, the work becomes almost valueless.
So, that means there's a lot less money for creative jobs such as music, film and novels. If there's less money to go around, more people will be willing to work for less... There was an article yesterday in the Guardian about the drop in book sales, decreasing the value of books, so that the only people who will be able to write books are those with another income - rich people with a fun hobby for example. This decreases the diversity and opportunity. Taking us back to a time when only the upper middle classes had the luxury of being able to write novels. Just an example
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:55:07
I think a lot of people don't get it because they ever have to do international business.
For example, I got paid by a company in a different country this year. It took a month, the banks charged us about $300 in fees and exchange rates, we had to pay an additional fee to find the money when they "lost" it. For sure I will be getting paid in Bitcoin next year. For a start, if they buy $5000 worth of Bitcoin it'll be worth $6000 by the time it arrives lol
You're focusing on buying pizza, that may never be the strength of Bitcoin. But you're ignoring the huge potential. Do you remember how awkward sending email used to be? Do you remember when there was only 1 in 100 of your friends and contacts who you could send email to? I do...

Yes, true. I get that.
I was watching an Andreas Antonopoulos video and he was talking about how people with Bitcoin suddenly became very interested in security and double factor authentication. Previously having used "password1234" for every signup.
What if your copy of a film was unique and you knew there were only 20 million (or a limited number) copies ever available? What if you began to think "hey this could be worth $$$$ in the future, but only if I don't share my copy. In fact, I need to stop other people stealing my (potentially) valuable copy".
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:00:00
I panic bought and sold in the first one. It was about a 30% drop over 4 days. This one hasn't reached 30% drop yet. I have a feeling it wont go down so far. It looks bigger but in % its smaller (so far)
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:02:31
How? Just curious

Use gdax. I found it simple to use and small fees
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:41:59
the current situation needs economies to keep inflating and expanding to survive. Which is why people say they're like a giant ponzi scheme. That debt needs to be fed or the whole thing collapses. Which is why the banks needed to be bailed out - otherwise the situation would have been revealed when they went to get their money out only to find either they weren't allowed to or their bank has bankrupt.
We need to keep consuming to keep this bubble intact. Can our planet survive ever expanding consumption?
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:57:17
If you own some Bitcoin you are a user. Whether you store it or spend it. Just like if I keep my £s in the bank - they're still mine. And by owning them I increase the value of £s.
When Facebook was first created it was very crude, but it started to take off. Then modifications, like adding the like button was a major change, meant it became the dominating force in social media.

but its not a wall. Its an incentive to look after something that might be valuable to you
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:17:21
The number of people who own Bitcoin is the value of Bitcoin. Hence the exponential gain in value. If you want comparable models: The number of people with Facebook accounts is the value of Facebook. The number of people with Google accounts is the value of Google. The number of people with Amazon accounts is the value of Amazon. There's a tipping point with web based economy where once so many people have a certain service then you have to have it, or risk losing business. eg: email.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:52:38
I don't know anything about trading. But when I started with Bitcoin about 1 month ago the GDAX depth chart (once you zoomed out) used to showed the orange section was thin and flat while the green was much higher. Right now the orange section is way bigger than before.
Does this mean a lot more people are selling now?
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:54:38
You have to sell your Bitcoin to euros then send them to your UK bank
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:44:30
1. Bitcoin has show itself to be very resilient to these shocks. If it's destined to be the Facebook of cryptos then those kind of power games can't knock it down. It might damage it for a few months but the sheer volume of pick by the masses will raise it back up.
2. With success come updates. Look at coinbase recently. Sudden spike in activity and the site melts down. 2 days later they're hiring 20 new people. The money's there the tech will follow
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:09:16
It'll keep going until only the hard core hodlers are left. And I suspect many of them are selling to buy back in at the bottom...
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:25:19
then you go to Saxo twitter and they're predicting a Bitcoin crash back to $1000

@_date: 2017-12-05 09:17:45
So we have Amazon that can sell in many countries, facebook that can connect us across the globe and google which we can search for any information from any country in any language.
And you don't see the potential in having a unit of currency which rides with those world dominating web platforms?
I worked for a company in a country with a different currency to mine. The reason I was able to work for that company is because of the internet. That side was smooth. But when it came to getting paid, suddenly everything sucked. The banks took $100s in fees and poor exchange rate, plus it took a month.
Any country which tries to avoid a global unit of currency will fall behind. Just as it would if it had tried to avoid using the internet.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:39:45
So if you own a lot of coin you can make some profits from just setting a high sell order with a ton of coin, then setting a buy back order to catch it again as it inevitably drops because you sold your 900 coins.
Is that how it works?
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:39:01

I'm concerned about that too. But I'm guessing with the millions of customers they have if they weren't transfering money out there would be a huge niose

Absolutely. Bitcoin is part of that adapting and evolving.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:45:02
there's a gap between what Coinbase lists the price at and what you buy at. I guess this is their profit. If you use GDAX there's no gap
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:38:58
don't people look at the % increase of value?
For example, investing in ETH early this year would have made you 5 times what you would have got investing in Bitcoin (even though Bitcoin has far greater value) - because ETH has made a far greater increase in value (by %, not by $)
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:35:40
the thing to look at is the % gains, not the overall price. This week it's up 15%. Nobody knows where it will stop
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:54:01
And I told so many people it wasn't a bubble

@_date: 2017-12-01 10:06:22
It clicked a couple of days ago when I kept reading "Bitcoin has no real value".
I realised its value IS it's number of owners. Like Facebook's value is it's users. The Facebook website would be very easy to replicate or even improve on. You could create a way better social media platform than Facebook and it would still get smashed. Why? because it's too late - Facebook owns it for the foreseeable future.
So the value of Bitcoin is how many people buy it - and therefore creates this exponential curve upwards.

The different exchanges have different prices. I'm guessing the slowing of transactions and fees are preventing people exploiting the difference.
Plus it's not possible to have access to exchange. So some exchanges are working their own bubble, I guess

@_date: 2017-12-02 10:12:59
No - the value of a cryptocurrency IS the number of people who own some (not how much they own).
That is why Bitcoin is so far ahead in value, because it has by far the greatest number of owners.
Like facebook - everyone is on it because everyone is on it.
That doesn't mean another coin wont take over, but until it has a larger number of owners its REAL value is less.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:14:12

When the bch goes on sale on Coinbase later, I guess that means there will suddenly be a whole lot more coins on the market.

I've been a Bitcoin Hodler for about a month, reading the reddit page every day. It just seems whenever anyone has problems and loses their coins its from it being in a wallet.
What if my coins become worth $100k. I don't think I'd be comfortable keeping it on a device that could get stolen or lost or broken. It's like having a safe with a gold bar in it - except more precarious.
I think I'd rather just sell it than have this issue and stress in my life, wondering.
Just my feeling as a regular person. I honestly can't see any of my friends or family doing this thing with the wallets...

Nobody knows when the best time to plant a tree is.
You could have planted it 20 years ago and there was a storm which blew the tree down. Or maybe there was no free land to plant it. Or maybe you were growing a different tree.
You can only plant the tree when the time is right for you to do so. Whether it's yesterday, tomorrow or 10 years from now
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:18:36
I get that. But the rocketing price had the effect of killing the small and medium transactions which were the foundation level of Bitcoin's value.

If you want comparable models:

I tried with a small amount of coin today. Don't know if I have the patience. I think it's difficult to know which way it's going. You can try setting buy and sell orders and see what happens. I just think with speed it's going up there's not much point

just to explain why: it takes 48 hours to get your coins from your vault
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:28:49
One reason is panic buyers tend to panic sell.
If the price starts to accelerate, people jump on hoping to catch the rise before it's too late. This causes a big spike as more and more jump on.
the price then starts to smash through sell orders. The price begins to decline. The panic buyers start panic selling. The price goes into reverse in the same way it went up.
Eventually the price hits the buy orders waiting below and begins to stabilise again.
Just my theory
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:36:38
happened at the last high traffic overload. its fine
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:41:41
More people need to buy Bitcoin.
It doesn't matter how much they buy as long as they buy some.
The number of owners of bitcoin creates the value of bitcoin.
But currently, it's still a bit like someone using email in 1990. Most people then would have found the concept a bit strange and complicated.
"I have to buy a modem and connect it to my telephone? Set up an account?? Server, username, password, what is all this crap, I don't have time!?? I don't understand computers. Hand written letters are just fine!"
10 years later... the idea of not having an email address would make you an eccentric.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:46:03
Sure thing. I certainly don't think it will crash to nothing. Bitcoin is the name that's imprinting itself on people's minds. However I'm old enough to remember when millions used Netscape and thought it was the boss. I also had a MySpace account and spent hours on it. Facebook came along and I signed up but didn't think anything of it. 
But until Bitcoin has maybe 500 million users this is way too early to call. I hope it wins because I have my money in it...
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:21:29
I've had a great life so far. I've rarely had to do any crap work for a living. I still earn royalties from my music and live off it, partly.

@_date: 2017-12-07 23:19:09
But a sudden decline after a sudden incline isn't really a crash. How about auto sells being triggered followed by auto buys? It does it every time there a sharp increase in value

tell me about the Facebook bubble again...
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:11:40
I think you're jumping way ahead.
First things first. At the moment, a tin y % of the world's population owns some Bitcoin. We can equate it to a gold. A digital gold which you can send anywhere in the world instantly. At the least, there's an appeal to people who live in countries with an unstable economy.
Facebook, Amazon and Google started as a supplement to what was already in existence. But they have grown to a point where they dominate economies and democracy (it seems). They have the power to decide elections now.
Before we talk about the entire population of the world, lets see if it makes 1%. Even 100th of the world population adaption would start to change things.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:34:02
here's one chart 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:53:06
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:55:56
triggering all those buy bots?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:26:49
yes. except that in web based economy the number of users relates directly to the value - so the number of Bitcoin owners is a real value 
the underlying value is similar to gold, except we have the internet so everything happens faster. It took 1000s of years for gold to become globally valuable. When the entire world is connected by instant communication you can understand how that process is sped up
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:56:31

@_date: 2017-12-03 15:42:41
who is making those promises?
If you look at pyramid selling schemes like HerbalLife they make promises to get people to sign up. "If you follow our instructions you will make $$$" they say. It's central to the business plan. The plan doesn't work if they don't make those promises.
Most people on this subreddit for example say "don't invest what you can't afford to lose because it could all go to nothing". No one running a pyramid scheme says that to a new "customer"
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:49:07

@_date: 2017-12-01 10:55:11
Google was by no means the first. Yahoo in fact arrived 3 years before Google. So it shows that being the first often counts against you, as the followers improve on your idea and make it more user friendly - Bitcoin certainly has that issue.
Bitcoin isn't guaranteed its top spot. We just don't know if it's Google or if it's Yahoo, or eXcite. However, even if it turns out to be Yahoo - that's still a future profit in 10 years time.
Its very possible that Bitcoin is the one which leads to bringing in the early adopters. Only for the "facebook" of cryptos to spring up from nowhere and take over. 
But that doesn't alter the fact that if you want to get an idea of Bitcoins current value, you need only look at it's current number of owners.
edit: [really there were a load of search engines before Google.](
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:56:02
well, I was just testing. Because I bought at the beginning of Nov and the price shot up and then came down again quite fast and I panic sold (but bought back in again).
It's just when new people throw in a load of money as it's hitting an ATH, if it drops even just 5% in a few hours, they sometimes panic...
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:39:25
I guess the difference might be that Bitcoin promises never to increase the number of copies beyond 21 mil and has a system designed to protect that number. The whole value of Bitcoin relies on no one being able to create copies
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:15:13
You said you sold your 500 BTC a week ago
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:42:18
the price is different on GDAX and Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:04:43
that sucks. But don't blame yourself. We are only human and humans are mostly ruled by our emotions (unless you're a psychopath).
So congratulate yourself on probably not being a psycho and buy back in. 
Also, you bought at $24 so you got lucky and sometimes fate swings the other way. You're still in the game.
Indeed, Bitcoin can still drop to nothing. Fate will swing another way again. Such is life - enjoy the ride!
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:26:01
so if  you have a Gemini account and a GDAX account you can buy a Bitcoin on Gemini for $15.6k send it to your GDAX and sell it for $17.6

only if you don't understand how value is created in a web economy.
with tulips, the tulips have to eventually sell for the promised price or the business collapses
with a Ponzi scheme, at some point you run out of people to support the deliberate fraud
Bitcoin is neither based on a product which needs to realise its value or on a fraud - nobody is promising you Bitcoin will be worth $x in the future. So nobody is investing based on a promise.
So why are they investing? Because other people are investing.
Why are people on Facebook? Because its the greatest social media platform and so incredibly entertaining and valuable in our lives?
Not at all - everyone is on it because everyone is on it. And that is  REAL value in a web economy.

if literally EVERYONE started using bitcoin as a currency, one coin would be worth millions.
We're talking about steady adoption. Remember when only 1% of the world used email? I do. It took a while for it to catch on and now nobody would not have an email account.
People still used email, even when only 1 out of every 100 of their friends and contacts had it.
But what we're talking about is people investing now in what they see as something potentially huge in the future. So the value now is more a reflection not of it's current use but of what people believe it could become.

Coke is physical. Different rules apply.
Bitcoin is a network. You have to look at businesses like Facebook or Google. The growth is exponential because people are on facebook because people are on facebook because people are on facebook... etc.
With Bitcoin the exponential effect is even greater, because by being on the Bitcoin network you increase your wealth. So the more people who join the network, the higher the price and the more people who want to join the network, and so on.
I don't have to drink coke just because my friends are drinking it.
If you consider Bitcoin will revolutionise the way we do business in the future (because everyone is using it, like they now use email), then you can see why is has greater value than a soft drink.

I find it ironic that the free market evangelists told us for decades a business must live and die on the market. Yet when the banks came close to collapsing, most of them were not allowed to fail and tax payers money was used to prop them up.
Printing money combined with low interest rates also has the added side effect of making people with property or assets richer whilst those without are left behind. So its pretty similar to Bitcoin - those who own some will benefit most, the earlier they buy in. Those who come in last will benefit least or be left behind.

For me, the $ or £ value of my bitcoins is just to give me a rough idea of their current value in the world, until stores start listing prices in BTC.

Bitcoin is a network. The more people on the network, the more valuable it is. 
What has futures got to do it it?
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:38:14
haha exactly. And with Bitcoin its like you buy an email account and every time someone else in the world starts using email your investment increases in value.
Which of course creates a stampede of people wanting to sign up. Once you've bought in, you have a big incentive to encourage your friends and family to get on board...
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:02:48
yeah was looking at that too. I was thinking to find the most trusted exchange and send it there

what will happen to the BTC price when BCH is for sale on coinbase? is it going to drop again?
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:37:02
Bitcoin needs mass adoption to survive and become a currency. If it has mass adoption the price will go way higher
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:06:35
It's barely gone down since the brief jump to 11k

you want advice from fellow Bitcoin addicts?
That's like asking crack users to help you with your crack habit
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:09:18
Bitcoin came about after banks gambled on a housing bubble. They lost so much money the banks were deemed "too big to fail". In other words, the money system was about to be exposed and collapse.
To prevent this it was decided the ordinary people of the world should pay to keep this bankers bubble unburst. And we're still paying for it.
Were we ever asked if we wanted to bail out the bankers gambling debts? No they made that decision for us.
But if you stored your wealth in Bitcoin they can't touch it. In fact as they print money to escape their gambling debts, it only encourages more people to buy Bitcoin...
So you say Bitcoin is bubble?

If you think Bitcoin is a good investment, it's probably not going to drop 60-70% in the next few weeks is it?
If you think it is, then it's probably a bad investment

I posted that earlier. Only a potential time delay from when the coin is sent to arriving

just how web based economy works
why is WhatsApp worth 17bn while Telegram is worth a fraction? 500 mil users (at the time of purchase)
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:49:25
just buy and HODL.
I bought my first coins in the rush of euphoria only to see the price crashing down 2 days later. I panic sold (telling myself the price was obviously going down to $2-3k and I'd buy back in then).
Literally 10 minutes after I sold, the price flew back up again. If I'd woken up 30 minutes later that Sunday, I wouldn't have lost 0.2 Bitcoin.
I told myself I was out. No more cryptos for me. But next day I bought back in, this time as a solid HODLER. After a week I had made back what I lost (in £ value).
So I say forget about trying to catch the right price. Just get in and HODL. If this thing is going up, it doesn't matter too much what price you get in at. If it's not, then you're wasting your money whatever price you pay.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:13:20

Well it's a feature of Bitcoin. It happens pretty regularly so it's not a sign of anything. You can't read anything into it to make future price calls
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:56:30
The number of people who own Bitcoin is the value of Bitcoin.
Hence the exponential gain in value.
If you want comparable models:
The number of people with Facebook accounts is the value of Facebook. The number of people with Google accounts is the value of Google. The number of people with Amazon accounts is the value of Amazon.
There's a tipping point with web based economy where once so many people have a certain service then you have to have it, or risk losing business. eg: email.

I don't agree with you. Right now we still have that system - those who staked claim first are now most powerful. Those whose families 1000 years ago laid claim to huge swathes of land in England are still some of the richest and most powerful in the country. They still own that land. Same in the USA. Those who bought Amazon shares early, got rich. But people STILL buy Amazon shares.
The resources won't have been scooped. But yes, those who adopt early will see most gains in their investment.
It's all about the tipping point. I have friends who hate facebook but still have facebook accounts - which means even they add value to facebook.

that's why traditional analysts don't understand it. They don't understand how the web economy works. They say "but it doesn't have any value".
Why did Facebook buy WhatsApp for 17 billion or whatever? They could have just copied it and made their own whatsapp messenger and it would have been just as good. They were buying the 500 million users who had whatsapp accounts
the real value of Bitcoin is the numbers of owners (which of course creates demand too).

My girlfriend has the right instincts for this. As it reached the ATH she was screaming at me to sell. I refused. Then as it came tumbling down I was panicking and saying I was going to sell. Meanwhile she was trying to transfer money to buy at the dip. I think I'll listen to her in future lol

Yes, but I'm not buying it as an investment. I'm buying it to free myself from banks and governments who are corrupt.
I might be being an idealist. But that's where your calculations are wrong - you haven't factored in how many millions of people in the world feel disconnected from the worlds wealth. You haven't factored in how many people are sick of seeing very rich folk hide their money from the tax man r use markets to abuse their position of power.
If this was just a get rich quick thing, I wouldn't have bothered. 
How did I know prices would keep going up. Because property has a long history. In London where there is only going to be greater demand it can only go up in the long term. I know Bitcoin doesn't have that history.
However, this is a very sound gamble. (ps I gamble for fun. I put down a £10 stake a few years ago and promised I would never add more more. if I lost that £10 the game over. It's now at £400. just from making clever bets and seeing good odds.)
You have a good chance with Bitcoin (and other cryptos) of getting a very good return. Yes you might lose everything. But winning the lottery in the UK is 14 million to 1. Winning the Bitcoin lottery is currently much much better odds than that...
But like I say there's more to it than money. Its about taking back some control from the people at the top who abuse it.

yes. We're not talking about cracking down on gambling or investigating Swiss banks. Neither of those things will have a big effect on the US economy as a whole. But suppressing a new tech like cryptocurrencies will eventually have a bad impact on your economy. Can you imagine running a modern economy without the internet? Look at the biggest US companies - Facebook, Google, Amazon. Cryptos are going to have a similar effect on economies. Any adopting country will see their economy advance.

If there's no reason for the price to go up (in your mind) there's equally no reason for the price to go down.
In 2014 some guy predicted Facebook was a bubble. So many times (until recently) I heard how Facebook was dead and people were turning away from it... but it keeps getting bigger.
That's the what people don't understand about web tech. The number of people who are subscribed is not a bubble - it IS the value of the thing you bought into.
That's why these things go up exponentially. The more people buy bitcoin the bigger its REAL value for no other reason than because more people bought Bitcoin.
Do you see?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:10:18
but if you want the value rises people are dreaming of here, you need mass adoption
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:27:18

@_date: 2017-11-30 18:01:54
Coinbase is ok.
But if you think normals will print out wallets, hide them in their mum's basement and remember complicated passcodes... basically that will never happen. Or set up hard wallets with the fear that their life savings will get stolen or lost or hacked. Again, its not going to happen

@_date: 2017-11-30 22:26:15
but in your other post you said you weren't into Bitcoin, you mostly bought ETH...
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:01:58
Yes. And my neighbours thought they were being smart by not paying for what they thought was overpriced property. But I was pretty certain property would keep going up, even allowing for the occasional drop.
What value does gold actually have? It's a fairly useless metal. Virtually the only reason it has value is because it has value. And this has continued for 100s of years.
Here's one small example: I recently got paid from a company in a country with a different currency to mine. The farce we had to go through to make this payment was ridiculous. The money got "lost" and after 3 weeks of waiting, we called the bank. They charged us $50 to find out where it was. Plus the fee for the transfer. Plus the nice exchange rate they gave themselves.
With Bitcoin there will be no more of this BS. Indeed, I will make sure the company buys bitcoin and sends that to me as wages next year.
So already, with this one small example (I can think of a ton of others), Bitcoin has greater value than gold.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:20:03

so what do you mean it doesn't have the biggest gains?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:44:56
well the price it shows on the chart and the value of your coins is less than the value it charges you to buy

"you should be asking yourself why it's worth paying ~$10k"
In 1999, me and my family and the couple who lived above us were forced out of the apartment we rented. We couldn't afford to buy in London, we weren't earning too much. However, we got lucky and managed to get on a housing association scheme with a 50% ownership.
The property we bought was £80,000 for a 2 bed flat. It wasnt the best place but I just knew we had to get on board the property game, as prices were shooting up. Meanwhile, our old neighbour couple had exactly the same opportunity (and £80,000 2 bed flat in the same road). But they turned it down because "it wasn't worth it".
To their minds at that time, £80,000 for a 2 bed in London seemed like a crazy price.
4 years later, we had bought the other half of our property and were ready to move into a house. We sold that flat for £180,000.
Meanwhile, our ex neighbours were still paying rent and had lost all chance of getting on the property ladder in London.
That property is now probably worth £300k plus. Is it "worth it"?
Is an iPhone worth $1000+ ?
If people are prepared to pay that amount then yes it is
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:26:33
The importance for Bitcoin is the number of people buying some. I personally think it's value is directly related to this.
Not how much they spend individually. How much we each spend now is our own call on how rich we're hoping to be in the future from it.
So if anyone is trying to have a more solid understanding of how much they should value Bitcoin then look at the number of people who own some. If it correlates with it's market value you can make a call on the price being over or undervalued.
Another thing: 60% of Bitcoin trades are made by Japanese people. So either Bitcoin is some strange mania peculiar to Japan or we should look to that area of the world for ideas on how the near future of Bitcoin looks.
