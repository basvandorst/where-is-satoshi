Thank you. I think I’ll sell with Kraken, do you know if you need to be 18?
@_date: 2019-07-18 20:40:55
Ah ok. Could you instantly transfer with your card or something?
@_date: 2019-07-18 02:57:33
Can you sell in Canada with Kraken? Can’t with coinbase
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:02:25
@_date: 2019-07-18 20:40:34
Ok, but kraken. If I give them my drivers license, utility bill.. then are there hold times on kraken?
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:51:18
Why’s that?
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:30:15
@_date: 2019-07-10 12:14:50
@_date: 2019-07-18 11:24:30
I love it already. I’m sold, kraken here I come
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:56:09
What if you have a hardware wallet? Wouldn’t this be irrelevant?
@_date: 2019-07-06 17:47:38
What’s a full node?
@_date: 2019-07-08 11:28:13
@_date: 2019-07-18 11:41:11
Yes, thank you bro
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:43:12
What if I’m selling my bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-18 11:25:36
How old do you need to be to use Kraken?
@_date: 2019-10-30 12:03:19
I would recommend less than 10 years, but what do I know?
@_date: 2019-10-27 20:08:46
@_date: 2019-10-12 21:34:48
Yes. Like all investments.

Way too bearish. Way too much support for it to happen. Just look at it, although I agree 100k anytime soon is way too optimistic, but 1k ain’t happening. 
In my opinion, both options are too far-fetched. I personally think 100k will happen before 1k, but it will take 20+ years.
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:24:35
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:52:36
Do they require ID?
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:27:19
Different mentalities man.. now I can say I told you so when we go to the moon
@_date: 2019-10-27 20:05:28
Well I live in my parents house so if it goes to 0 I’m broke but still can live
@_date: 2019-06-22 09:45:28
Don’t kick yourself, that’s life for you. We all have regrets and wish we did this and this more, just know to buy the dip now.
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:13:30
Trezor or ledger. All personal preference from there.
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:18:44
12 hours is nothing. Stop being so paranoid.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:15:40
Where to sell?
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:22:13
What app or website is this?
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:12:41
Lol what if you have your seed you’re fine
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:12:21
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:29:41
Yeah this is really good
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:43:04
Bullish sign I assume
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:44:17
Not always better.
@_date: 2019-02-24 17:21:46
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:31:37
1k ain’t happening lol
@_date: 2019-06-16 04:49:29
Damn bro. That’s my dream right there.. 17 and all I can do is dream for now
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:24:20
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:54:25
Where can I buy? Coinbase is fucking shit with its limits
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:38:05
It’s all about the purchasing power, and putting it into perspective with the dollar. No one knows how much purchasing power 1.28492828282 btc has unless you put it into the dollar.
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:01:34
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:14:35
I’d say a slow steady upwards trend of 13k by August, and a drop to $10 on September 13, back up to 80k on September 27.
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:55:53
That’s what I plan to do, just not sure where to do it anonymously.
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:12:14
@_date: 2019-02-24 17:18:53
Saw some random convenience store with a sign saying Buy BTC here! In Toronto Canada 
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:10:31
All my friends keep telling me they’re too broke to invest. “Yeah my $5 would turn into $10, whatever”
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:36:15
I sold my btc. Sorry man, I’ll buy some and make it go up to 15k.
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:56:58
Don’t call me guy, babe
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:26:43
Can you sell bitcoin without Id?
@_date: 2019-06-15 05:18:19
Can you sell on those sites anonymously?
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:45:50
Claim bankruptcy!
@_date: 2019-04-15 11:36:15
Thank you lol, needed this
@_date: 2019-04-16 22:23:48
@_date: 2019-04-14 23:29:08
Ahh. I understand. Thank you very much
@_date: 2019-04-09 00:19:20
Thank you brother, and I think as long as your email and your wallet is fully secured with all the security options, you should be fine. Only thing I’m worried about is being sim swapped, so I’m keeping my phone number private for sure.
@_date: 2019-04-15 11:58:38
Sick man! I got my dad into BTC. Sold him some for no rate at all :) he’s HODLing
@_date: 2019-04-14 23:27:21
So it’s the total balance of the persons wallet that I’m sending to? Because none of the totals equaled my wallet balance
@_date: 2019-06-20 22:36:54
In my opinion it would be like the big exchanges giving out loans, ones with your ID and stuff, and I guess they’d have your address and all that to harass you if needed...
@_date: 2019-04-16 22:28:54
Can someone explain to me who these guys are and what’s happening? Thanks, I’m clueless
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:33:55
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:51:44
LOL upvote for you
@_date: 2019-04-15 11:53:49
What’s satochi?
@_date: 2019-04-12 12:06:35
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:39:26
You can find people selling it for 1:1 on ogusers.com. Use a trusted middleman to ensure you don’t get scammed, preferably Beam or Amp and confirm on site with them if you’re dealing off site to be sure it’s not a fake. 
@_date: 2019-04-15 12:09:46
100,000 by June so I’d say 8 mil in 2 years?
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:34:20
What is considered a “significant amount” 
@_date: 2019-04-08 12:13:54
Alright thanks bro. Just cause I know people with 20k+ in an online wallet and they aren’t worried, and are very smart people... which lead me to not be worried about mine cause it’s not close to that, so I’m debating on whether or not I should buy a hardware wallet. I would be doing around 5 transactions a day, would it still be easy enough with a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2019-09-25 11:48:17
Cuz idk how
@_date: 2019-09-29 17:19:19
Thanks for your pessimism, redditor for 4 days
@_date: 2019-05-07 12:21:47
@_date: 2019-05-07 12:26:39
Hmm, teenager here and I’m into bitcoin, trying to get into investing more. Would it be smart of me to buy gold? Just to get my fingers in more holes
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:27:18
Ahh thank you
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:18:53
High school student.
@_date: 2019-05-08 11:29:07
Ah yes. This. This is the reason I was looking for, thank you. I will keep my stuff confidential.
@_date: 2019-05-07 12:22:39
I never get why people are so scared about sharing their bitcoin amount, only reason I could think of is getting sim swapped
@_date: 2019-05-06 11:59:07
Well yea but I have more in bitcoin than I’d rather force myself to spend at once, so where would I sell the rest?
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:07:39
Exactly. I've been further even more decided to use even go need to do look more as anyone can. Can you really be far even as decided half as much to use go wish for that? My guess is that when one really been far even as decided once to use even go want, it is then that he has really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like. It's just common sense, especially with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:45:15
Just a question- if a day comes that you want to sell all your BTC, where would you sell? What’s the best place?
@_date: 2019-05-07 19:54:03
Yeah but literally no one on reddit knows anything about me. 
Please correct me if wrong, but I could go around bragging about this and that, and no one would be able to track me down. I obviously wouldn’t give out any personal info
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:19:21
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:21:50
Ahh I see. Can you explain what bullish and bearish means?
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:13:54
I’m just trying to say that I've been further even more decided to use even go need to do look more as anyone can. Can you really be far even as decided half as much to use go wish for that? My guess is that when one really been far even as decided once to use even go want, it is then that he has really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like. It’s common sense and I’m not sure how no one else realized it yet.
