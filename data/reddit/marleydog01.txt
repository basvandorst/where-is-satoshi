You can get all the same benefits of alt coin mining by plugging in all your electrical devices and turning them on and letting them run forever and then light a pile of money on fire and then cry in a dark corner.
Same general idea.

Yep, and there should also be surveilance cameras in the background with Coinbase and Circle  logos on them watching what everybodys doing...

yes, stop trying to use bitcoin the same way you used other financial instruments in the past. that's the fundamental issue. it's not the same, it will require you to understand that and use it appropriately. stop faxing emails. stop pulling cars with horses. stop giving other people the keys to your bitcoin. you don't have to. that's what was required with dollars. bitcoin is the next evolution and everyone wants to just use it like their old stupid money. well ok, this is what happens.

you're handling my **[ass bitcoins!](
@_date: 2015-03-25 11:46:34
since it takes time to process transactions, doing so could potentially cause the miner to lose the block race which he already won in only 43 seconds ... he's taking the 25BTC rather than risk it all on collecting a few transaction fees.
and of course, he could be a she.. or an algorithm

It's not so strange at all to beg for money in r/bitcoin
Lots of people do it
@_date: 2015-03-25 11:43:19
it's not stealing if you hold the keys. everyone holds their own

A ripple, in the end, will be all they will have made. A ripple along side the Bitcoin tsunami.
