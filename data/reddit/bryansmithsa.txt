I think that's a reasonable way of looking at it. I tend to see fiat currency / modern banking as a thesis, and cryptocurrency as an antithesis. I think there'll be a range of different propositions we might end up with some form of synthesis. I don't necessarily agree with Jimmy's views, but I do find them interesting.

This is something that's been in my thoughts \- how decentralized is Bitcoin, really? I don't feel we can call it a fully decentralized currency when a majority of wealth sits in just a few wallets. To me, that's recreating a fair distribution crisis. On the other hand, I think PoW protocols handle this challenge somewhat more gracefully than PoS protocols do.

News like this makes me wonder if privacy coins aren't significantly underplayed. I wonder what affect this might have on the confidence of ordinary users when transacting in BTC?

Agreed. I think things will get off to a reasonable start by the end of the year, but we're probably looking at an adoption period of at least 5 years

I imagine this is likely after Facebook and Google banned crypto advertisements - we might see more ICO projects shift to airdrops in the future to circumvent some of the emerging marketing &amp; regulatory issues

I definitely think the Lightning Network is the key in moving Bitcoin out of the 'store of value' phase and giving some sense of liquidity to BTC hodlers. By the end of 2018 I feel we'll have enough momentum to start.

I feel Bitcoin's privacy isn't so much the issue as is the pervasiveness of entities such as the NSA.
I do echo his sentiments on Zcash, though, which I have found more and more interesting as time goes on.

Buck the trend... halve the block size ;)

I think, all fear aside, this will be a positive move for the industry. So long as regulation is applied consistently and fairly, great projects should thrive.

I agree. Regulation might get hearts a-pounding, but I feel it will also minimise the risk of scam projects and offer greater reputability for earnest crypto platforms.
