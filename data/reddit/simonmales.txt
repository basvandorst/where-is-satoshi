Out of interest, which other Bitcoin sites have onion addresses?
I'm in the process of making my own site available directly via an onion address.
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:32:39
@_date: 2016-04-22 19:24:53
Pretty simple actually, I use Blockchain.info Receive Payment API. Also I use BlockCypher as a back up for notifications.
@_date: 2016-04-22 12:55:05
Dammit I have been doing wrong all this time. I keep asking the pigeons for permission!
@_date: 2016-04-22 21:07:51
Early on when I just released the service and the site was buggy I would be lying if I didn't look into a couple of the first faxes. Now I don't.
Faxes are deleted after they have been delivered. What is exposed to me is the number of pages, file name and destination number.
I hold onto faxes that failed to send for the sake of resending.
Hasn't happened in a while, but I had customer uploading PDFs with a invalid page number, which would of thrown an error on the site. Luckily the customer jumped onto E-Mail and told me that he was creating PDFs from his scanner. Definitely in these few situations I saw the complete fax. Since then I have found a way for that problem not to persist.
PS I cover most of this on the privacy page. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 11:56:57
Sucks about the failure. If you have the original E-Mail respond back to it and I can return you your satoshis.
@_date: 2016-04-22 12:27:29
Couldn't say, but funnily enough not many faxes have been sent to the UK.
@_date: 2016-04-11 19:55:11
Fair, I guess you are too nice to play dumb and say I don't really know what it is.
@_date: 2016-04-22 12:54:02
It's more of a project. I was previously working full time on a Bitcoin project, since wrapping that up I wanted to keep doing something Bitcoin related.
@_date: 2016-04-22 12:47:24
Oh boy, are you in for a treat! 
If you have 30 minutes, this is actually really interesting.

Which countries can you send a fax too? Pretty much all of them.
@_date: 2016-04-22 12:16:38
Totally understand your point! Unfortunately I don't have such a system in place :)
Meanwhile  I'm happy return satoshis, it is only the fair thing do it.
Though I'm actually interested investigating BIP 70 because merchants can receive refund addresses automatically.
@_date: 2015-12-02 07:33:16
I'm definitely affected. The Notification API was flawless.
@_date: 2015-06-15 09:53:24
E-Mail confirmation is now available. If you get the chance to use it, let me know.
@_date: 2015-12-16 10:42:08
I agree, the Network Traffic tab provides some visual gratification.
I guess the other GUI feedback that could be made available is the size and break down of the contents in the mempool.
@_date: 2015-12-16 14:31:38
Buy Bitcoins with cash via localbitcoins (for example), that will help you reduce paper trail.
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:27:57
Thanks for the shout-out and thanks for thinking of Bitcoin Fax when you need to send a dreadful fax :)
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:46:11
I started in Bitcoin in 2014, and the Bitcoin Core client is the first one in the list and still is.
After downloading 20-30 gigabytes, I wasn't convinced that Bitcoin was ready for the casual user.
@_date: 2015-12-02 09:51:25
Sweet, I was just Googling around for an alternative.
The Notification API was the only thing I used, and never experienced any issues. Though my usage was quite low, watching few hundred addresses over six months or so.
@_date: 2014-07-17 15:28:04
I managed to spend my first Bitcoins in Paris last week at Sof's Bar. Cool little bar.
First heard about it on Reddit: 
@_date: 2014-10-08 16:28:54
But it really aired on TV. (If that was the question).
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:49:20
Thanks for reaching out!
I completely forgot about the file size limit! It is _meant_ to be 10MB which was set on the testing site before Bitcoin Fax went live.
I have just made the change and 10MB PDFs should be uploaded without a problem now.
Hopefully there won't be any confusion in the future as I have noted the file size limitation on the About page as well.
Lastly faxes are converted to greyscale before sending, which unfortunately for some colour faxes may look quite different from there original file.
Again thanks for reaching out and calling out my oversights, really appreciated!
@_date: 2017-02-23 06:49:41
My initial reaction as well.
@_date: 2014-10-08 20:10:04
No, it's legit. It also mentions virtual currencies earlier in the show.
S06E02, about 30 minutes in is the Bitcoin reference.
@_date: 2016-03-05 16:55:12
I just tried this for the first time on the full node running on my desktop.
In Android Bitcoin Wallet I set my desktop as a trusted peer, and confirmed it's connection in the network monitor. Next I checked 'Skip regular peer discovery' and confirmed my desktop was the only connection in network monitor. Lastly I could see my wallet as a peer in my nodes debug window.
I sent off some coins, then the wallet was hanging onto the following message: "This payment has not been transmitted yet". I was a bit worried until I got an E-Mail on that a payment had being received on that watched address. Soon after it was confirmed and the wallet updated.
Cool :)
Question, online block explorers show different Relay IPs, I was totally expecting to see my own IP there. But I guess they are representing the source node which first shared the transaction to the explorer?
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:14:02
Just sent my first RBF transaction! 
@_date: 2016-01-28 06:15:00
Yes, interesting point. I guess the bandwidth requirements would still double (if avg block was computer in 5 minutes).
Though possibly it is one of those things that cannot be changed. Like the total number of coins.
@_date: 2016-03-09 07:32:49
Very cool, I didn't know of this fork.
@_date: 2016-03-02 13:00:16
Which vectors?
@_date: 2016-03-06 01:26:19
I'm interested to learn more about the MITM attack, could you share a link?
@_date: 2016-01-26 09:24:34
I guess the index the all the transactions? I'd imagine along the lines of bitcoind with the txindex option.
@_date: 2016-01-27 17:17:05
A bit of math is always healthy when understanding mining :)
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:42:26
Thank you kindly.
@_date: 2016-03-02 15:22:04
So rather then flood the network with 1MB of data, the attacker has to send more?
@_date: 2016-03-06 08:55:35
OK, so wallet to node connection are unencrypted. Are there BIPs to encrypt this channel?
Or is the solution to use Tor.
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:26:46
The great thing about Bitcoin is no one has to be obliged, it is permissionless!
@_date: 2016-01-27 17:16:40

Interesting, I do have a node on my desktop, I could just transfer to my VPS. Thanks for the idea.

Only one I have used. And it works.

As a merchant, PayPal can freeze you funds.
With Bitcoin, no one can.
@_date: 2016-06-20 06:39:18
I like the use of 'verified' over confirmation.
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:08:52
Trying to give you a heads up that your question could be more accurately answered.
@_date: 2016-06-02 10:20:31
They still have a free tier, which is rate limited: 
@_date: 2017-01-06 07:32:25
I too have high hopes for small transactions that equate to a few fiat cents.
Looking forward to segwit taking hold, then eventually lightning.
@_date: 2016-06-14 06:28:56
I'll have to do it next time. I have since restarted bitcoind and the last messages have been overwritten.
Though when I looked at the debug.log the last hundred lines looked like this:
    receive version message: /Satoshi:0.11.2/: version 70001, blocks=274475, us=*.*.*.*:8333, peer=2478
    AdvertizeLocal: advertizing address *.*.*.*:8333
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:15:29
Do not consider the transaction legitimate until the transaction ID is in a block ("confirmed").
@_date: 2017-01-22 15:15:16
If you are going to ask for help, it usually helps to explain what you have tried, then the community can gauge your understanding.
Bitcoin Core will only give you access to transactions in your wallet. If you want to know the confirmation of transactions not in your wallet, you need to enable 'txindex' configuration parameter. It will need to reindex you blockchain, and thus take some time.
Then you can issue the 'gettransaction' command into Bitcoin Core, and then you can get the number of confirmations.

Original thread:

Also likely you are running a HD wallet.

Oh, I forgot again that Bitcoin had failed.
"The rise in official interest in digital currencies comes as one of the most famous virtual currencies, Bitcoin, continues to be plagued by problems."
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:41:12
Haven't noticed any particular fax destinations being flooded. A hand full of users are regularly using it (i.e. couple of times a month).
@_date: 2016-02-18 12:36:30
I use blockchain.info v1 and now v2, intermittent issues in the past (v1) but I as long as you have a cache of generated addresses you are pretty safe.
@_date: 2017-04-23 08:56:49
Can't control the fax destination. Typical reasons:
* Voice answered
* Transmission error (very vague, but the fax started receiving and then it stopped)
* No answer (retried 4 times)
How did I come up with the idea? I needed to send a fax once and didn't want to sign up to any service. *Wished* I could pay with Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-04-22 17:19:19
Currently zero.
@_date: 2017-04-23 08:54:38
A few occasions were transactions have been stuck for up to a week. Otherwise most transactions confirm relatively quickly.
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:35:47
How did you figure that?
@_date: 2017-04-22 15:30:28
Wow! 
It's obviously a fake number. So you when provide a number, the site tries to guess what type of number it is. This literally comes up as UNKNOWN and it has a fallback of 'this must be a premium rate number'. Though this is the most extreme I have ever seen.
If you try an existing/real fax number, you should get a realistic price.
@_date: 2017-04-22 19:37:35
When I started, nothing relevant appeared when searching for "bitcoin fax". So I knew SEO wouldn't be a problem. Developers who come from the school of thought that (old) Google sees the web the same as a blind person, then you can treat SEO as the same as accessibility.
I have a number of translations, but they are rarely used. But I believe they might help the ranking for non English SERPs.
Did a presentation about Bitcoin Fax at a Bitcoin meetup here in Berlin which was well received.
When a translation was completed, I reached out to Bitcoin meetup organisers native to that language. Though it only worked with the Tokyo meetup but I haven't tried reaching out to the Turkish community yet.
No ads. Most of the awareness comes from this very subreddit.
@_date: 2017-04-22 15:46:02
I do have a pricing page :)
@_date: 2016-02-26 20:04:38
This might help. 
@_date: 2016-09-30 09:05:00
Taking you up on that offer :)
Happened again, didn't noticed until now.
Node is running 0.12.1, I will be updating it soon.
@_date: 2015-04-24 23:57:36
Protip (from the Bitcoin Fax guy): Faxes are optimised for reducing the amount of ink used and will often invert the document to do so.
Best to start with a white background!
@_date: 2015-04-22 22:40:26
* Virtual Private Server from Linode
* Ubuntu 14.04
* Ruby on Rails
* Fax Gateway (via API)
@_date: 2015-04-22 21:54:31
Very real!
Now I wish I launched earlier!
@_date: 2015-04-23 08:55:13
Short term: No.
Long term: Possibly.
@_date: 2015-04-25 00:02:21
As mentioned in an another thread. Best to optimise faxes to use the least amount of ink. So start with a white background.
Another idea though I should provide the best rendering of the Bitcoin logo to be sent via Fax.
@_date: 2015-04-23 08:55:27
Could be fun!
@_date: 2015-04-23 04:53:43
A few people have mentioned this when I was developing it.
I personally wouldn't know how to do this, but also I am not particularly a fan of spamming the Blockchain with messages.
@_date: 2015-04-23 04:46:15
I'm thinking more along the lines of capturing an E-Mail address after the fax is sent. Then providing a confirmation via E-Mail for your records.
@_date: 2015-04-22 22:23:16
Thanks for sharing the picture!
Really appreciate it.
@_date: 2015-04-23 04:39:17
Well aware they exist :)
I chatted to a few people people before putting this out, which is how I found out about the free services.
Some of them include ads, which are not always desirable.
@_date: 2015-04-22 22:26:33
If the same file it being sent multiple times it is a definite sign of worry.
Though easy to circumvent as well: different filename or slight modification of file contents.
@_date: 2015-04-23 10:20:52
No joke. Just faxing real.
@_date: 2015-04-23 04:55:22
Yes fuzzy hashing would help, though I have only ever done that with plain old strings!
@_date: 2015-04-23 05:41:13
If you create a paper wallet, completely possible :)
@_date: 2015-04-22 21:46:57
Thought I would support the Bitcoin economy by helping those who still need to send faxes from time to time.
@_date: 2015-04-23 04:43:23
Yes! I just read about the obsession that the Japanese have with faxes on @_date: 2015-04-23 12:37:57
I'm aware of some Linode Bitcoin incident, but I haven't read into it.
Though the coins are not stored on the server.

Sure. Share the link here once it is up.
@_date: 2015-04-22 22:15:14
Great question.
Honestly, I haven't put any precautions in place to evade spammers. I've toyed with the idea of a providing an API though in that situation a registration would be mandatory.
Services such as Mollom(.com) come to mind though it provides protection against content spam. Possibly if I can share the content of the fax with Mollom they can provide heuristics on the level of spammy content. Literally just an idea.
Any other ideas?
@_date: 2015-04-24 23:59:18
Not yet :)
Though not actively working either. Few bumps to smooth out first.
@_date: 2015-04-23 07:02:42
Sadly they do not.
@_date: 2015-04-25 00:36:32
Quite possibly!
The PDFs uploaded to Bitcoin Fax is stripped right back to basics before they are sent out.
@_date: 2015-04-23 07:23:34
Luckily there isn't much content. But everything should be in an English language file.
The real test is getting it translated!
@_date: 2016-10-14 20:53:19
This is cool.
Started making something like this myself, mostly to learn how Service Workers can make offline apps.
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:24:15
I agree. I have a few ideas on how to do this, and it would make some fun research.
@_date: 2016-10-28 19:37:10
Poses a slightly different question. Does anyone track unconfirmed transaction that leave the mempool?
@_date: 2016-10-29 00:54:40
I was thinking on the node level.
A node could technically keep track of txs that never made it to the chain.
@_date: 2016-10-17 17:29:45
Your blockchain.info description is not entirely correct. You accept payments directly, i.e. you hold the the private key. Blockcypher is similar in this regard.
If you have a tinfoil hat, you could say that blockchain.info  could tell you to accept payments on an address you don't own. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:13:33
Cheers, I still have control over the Twitter account, but don't want to pump the mindless social media content that a lot "project" accounts have. 
@_date: 2015-11-25 07:50:53
I use the v1 of the Receive API by blockchain.info. Of course you still have a trust a third party.
Though recently I have been looking into Electrum's payment processing features: 
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:15:00
I should review the pricing, I initially had a hard limit on the minimum transaction size due to the Blockchain.info Recieve Payment API v1, but that is long gone.
@_date: 2016-10-07 06:25:38
Have you check with Kraken if they have an alternative account to deposit to?
@_date: 2015-11-17 12:54:58
I did it as a wedding gift. Buddy says he doesn't know what to do with it for now and keeps it in a fire proof safe.

I'm aware and have used it before, but I wanted old transactions :)
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:28:56
Yes, but if you like to navigate the web with a keyboard the OPs suggestion is useful.
@_date: 2018-04-23 06:26:28
Fair enough, price was minimum 0.0005 BTC when that wasn't worth all that much. Now 0.0005 is worth something.

Even Youtube would do.
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:28:32
I'm sure the CEO of Bitcoin is really happy.
@_date: 2016-07-04 06:26:17
It just got confirmed.
