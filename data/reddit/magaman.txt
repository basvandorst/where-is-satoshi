Oh no, I've only waited a week and felt it's taking forever
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:29:36
Same here, been almost a week...

How soon everyone forgets this August post which clearly states they were adding support before the end of the year 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:24:14
They announced support in August

Strange my banks have never shutdown and ran away with my money. Also strange if a bank were to do that, I'd get my money back from the government.
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:17:31
And i thought only the JP Morgan's, and Bank of America's of the banking world only did these sort of things.
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:06:35
Ah yes the liberal mindset, you have enough money so you should just give me stuff for free.
@_date: 2015-05-07 01:15:42
Man Joshy really is a freaking nutjob
@_date: 2015-05-07 01:12:23
Unfortunately we will never hear about the outcome of this story as it will now play out over years in court. But truthfully this kids story stinks, "16K for a "music video"" and that is his DREAM. I would put money on it we find out when the case is finished that he was moving drug money.
@_date: 2015-05-08 19:14:34
Down vote this so people don't fall for another Joshy Garza scam.
@_date: 2015-01-23 23:59:49
For all those that say it sounds sketchy how can this work, well don't worry it will NEVER work because the normal citizen in the world won't understand at all what they have to do to make one.
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:11:37
What you don't think the third world citizen who washes their clothes in a river filled with sewage would have a use for such technology when they don't even have indoor plumbing?
@_date: 2015-04-10 02:40:11
Listen folks these are all lies, and Josh is gonna sue for defamation..... It's just sad that this ass is still walking the streets and still trying to fleece people. People like him do nothing but hurt crypto and prevent it from breaking out. For Crypto to ever be taken seriously, people like him need to be eaten alive by the community and we have to stop with the daily new shit alt-coin. The general populous isn't gonna want to deal with the crap, when it's just easier for them to buy things with cash as they do now.
@_date: 2015-04-02 17:21:31
You better watch out folks, Josh is gonna sue everyone in here for telling LIES, though I guess that means he'll also have to sue the SEC. This guy is insane how is he still walking the streets?
@_date: 2015-04-03 22:30:01
All lies............. we should all send Josh soap on a rope, he is gonna need it, cause they are gonna love his pretty little butt in prison.
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:57:55
They sent a tweet that they are out of the free BTC, but appear to be planning a future giveaway.
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:02:15
Only if you can promise constant returns and $20 value
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:46:50
Yeah I just cashed everything i had in there out. I'm done, I'm taking the loss and just gonna sit here and watch the show.
@_date: 2015-03-17 21:28:49
They said they will extend the offer for 2 hours after the site comes back up.
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:03:47
And there goes Hashtalk......
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:01:18
Yeah it seems they ran out of the free BTC. Glad I got it earlier this afternoon.
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:35:25
Good find! Now the question I have, should I keep using Circle or stick with Coinbase?????
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:38:20
There seems to be a delay, I had made a buy yesterday didn't see it on the app instantly. Did it again, still nothing, went on the website and saw multiple buy transactions. Seems with all the issues their system is having there are slight delays. The initial buy went through in about 5 mins and the others auto canceled.
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:24:34
So yeah my approval went through in 24 hours but..... apparently I'm stuck in pre-approved because of the state I live in and they haven't filed whatever paperwork to allow customers from the state.
@_date: 2015-03-08 01:08:04
It's nice, and I still have my "Hashstakers" so I guess if there is a miracle, which I doubt I guess it won't be all for a loss. It would have been nice to have finally had a decent cloud based solution. People like Josh and GAW are what is keeping Crypto from really taking off. So many scams and so much BS that the normal person doesn't want to deal with.
@_date: 2017-07-07 21:49:21
He is more productive then all of us combined. With the amount of money he spends on a daily basis he is providing income for many people. It might be hard to understand that concept as he isn't working a "normal" job, but just think all those hotel stays pay for various staff, all the items he purchases pay for manufacture workers, and so on and so on. He is much more productive for society then the hourly hamburger flipper or cashier will ever be.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:29:23
yeah, though it seems it won't matter since verification is apparently super delayed due to the influx of users and I won't be able to deposit before the 1st.
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:21:18
I can't believe how blind I was a few months back when I first found GAW, Hashlets, etc. While I'm glad I have no more then $100 USD tied up with them, I hope the SEC rips Josh and all those involved apart. I know many people have invested thousands in this scam. Josh also has once again shown why it's so hard for Crypto to really become more mainstream, the community is just filled with con artists and crooks.
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:27:13
"We number of deals have finished and a few are in negotiation." IS THAT ENGLISH. This guy has the writing skills of a 5 year old.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:43:37
I'm keeping my fingers crossed that at least my tier 1 verification goes through magically.
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:54:37
So as a total noob, who has a few dollars on Coinbase, if I want to try to make a few more dollars flipping BCH and not jumping through the technical software wallet hurdles, it would be best to just transfer everything to Kraken for the time being? Wait for them to give me my BCH, either hold it or turn it into a little BTC, then bounce it back to wherever. I only use Coinbase because my bank supports transfers to them and for the little I've used/needed it it's worked fine.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:48:28
What about Level 1?
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:48:25
Yeap, I gave them the benefit of the doubt, and for a few months I had zero issues, and the claims people were making, no payouts, not able to sell etc. I found were not an issue. But since Paycoin it's been nothing but scam city and I was still giving them the benefit of the doubt, but now I'm done, especially since I log in and find out of the blue they halted mining operations. I was hoping to just cashout with the honor program and be done with these guys. Now the question is do I feel like filing an SEC complaint.
