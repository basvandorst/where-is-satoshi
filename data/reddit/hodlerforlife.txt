What are those?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:32:43
Why? A better decision would be to divest into alts. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:07:12
What are those?
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:13:06
It could be 4,000 in 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:13:12
Pretty soon you'll have a BCH machine next to it.  /s
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:52:18
Maximalists keep saying this yet BCH keeps making inroads, and sense.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:12:39
At some point they'll care.  I can't see any scenario where the market would swallow a $500 fee if BTC &lt; $20,000 can you?
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:24:18
Right, so what happens if the fees continue at an exponential rate?
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:30:19
I don't see the issue here.  BCH holds to Satoshi's original vision and BTC is a novelty coin for 1% types that's growing useless under high fees.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:45:24
Are we defining an attack as people leaving Bitcoin for an alternative due to an unaddressed feature flaw in the coin?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:08:31
ETH is much more useful and much cheaper.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:44:24
Yeah, they're not dropping.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:10:13
Together no matter what the transaction fees.  Bring on $1000 fees and let's invalidate the original use case of Bitcoin....together.
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:16:27
So you're banking on the greater fool theory to get rich?  Not a good strategy.
@_date: 2019-01-06 18:09:01
We're only six days into the new year.
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:44:13
Unless you bought 5 years, no one is getting rich from Bitcoin.  But the overarching issue is the clown show going on here and the goofy religious tribalism insisting that it's BTC or nothing.
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:07:56
Wait you don't lose until you go to fiat?  You must really believe in fiat.
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:50:03
Because it takes days to complete a transaction?
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:30:55
+1 to both of you guys.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:27:13
But from where?  $700?
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:45:03
Which explains why the best devs have gone to other coins.
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:53:59
What is going on with this community? 
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:00:04
I agree. BTC Is a religion, take this post.  It's an epic, hypocritical rant telling everyone to shut up. lol.
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:48:19
And you're basing all this on the price action of Ethereum of just a couple months.  Given the technology, they're probably right to be excited.  Unlike the dying dinosaur of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:55:09
For every arrogant trader I've seen crow this, I've yet to see one come back to tell us all we've been wrong for hodling. I imagine you too will slip quietly into the ether as you work yourself out of your coins (or FOMO and violate your trading rules and walk away).
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:49:23
It's what BTC maximalists do best.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:50:05
Spoken like good Bitcoin maximalist.  Well done comrade. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:46:18
I think it means Ethereum is better because it is scalable, open, decentralized and free from infighting.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:51:27
I don't see how a digital pet rock is useful.
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:16:32
Reason not to use Coinbase AND not buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:56:09
That's not a trick, it's delusion.  It is gambling.
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:15:58
Probably better for Coinbase to drop BTC until BTC fixes their issues.
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:06:23
This period is more like your favorite restaurant being closed down for health violations and the restaurant down the street has essentially the same food preparation model.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:05:28
Horrible or not he's right. And the resistance to why he's right is why Bitcoin's dominance days are sun setting.  
@_date: 2018-12-13 03:19:03
Charlie Lee's scammer coin?
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:28:53
Fake or not...hello, $2,500....
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:39:05
As bearish as I am at the current level, $1k or below would really surprise me.
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:00:12
So they have 6 days and haven't released the beta?  Amateur hour anyone?  
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:05:49
Bitcoin is a religion for some.  Why else do you think they defend a coin as "digital gold" now that its use case has become obsolete.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:39:41
Nice synopsis.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:43:20
I think if the ETH shills are a shills like me, they come here out of curiosity to see what the fighting is all about.  We don't need BTC folks coming to ETH to support the price, there is plenty of new money and corporate support to do that - and we of course, welcome BTC folks with open arms - but the reason we come here is to try to grapple with how the first mover in the space is imploding internally in spectacular fashion.  For my part, I want BTC to succeed.  I hope you guys do hit $10k per coin, it only helps us both.  We are not your enemy, the enemy is within right now.
