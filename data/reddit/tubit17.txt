Tbh bank transfers weren't taking that long. They probably have you the 'we requested payment' 'payments being processed' 'should be seen on your end next week'. I'm a crypto enthusiast working in adtech in Israel. Very common practice here and generally accepted. People have a very hard time adjusting to the attitude here and a lot of it does come from the geopolitical situation/ desensitization that comes from growing surrounded by terror. There was a bus bombing in Jerusalem today, we were all in the office and just went 'oh'... Went back to work no one worried we still went for drinks after and all.

I'll bet on Israel discount bank... Most companies I've worked for here used it but it is falling out of favor.

Damn you

No, no one is. That's the point... (or at least one of many)

Why don't you not be a fuck, stop trying to feel superior and educate people rather than belittle them.

Cool thanks.

Serious question, what about the 'vault' offered by Coinbase?
@_date: 2015-08-12 14:02:02
You use an exchange like coinbase (or others) to buy bitcoin with USD unless you have access to a BTM (atm for xbt map linked below) then you can choose to use the exchanges wallet or to transfer it to a different wallet which is what I think most people on here would suggest, however I believe coinbase takes care of the miner fees and don't believe most other wallets do. Circle is another user friendly wallet but for the best security you want to hold all private keys (noth that coinbase and circle aren't secure as is.

Blockchain. Not bitcoin. Stop spreading lies. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 03:57:40
What are you looking for on the negative side? Random computer scientists saying the code isn't perfect? If you don't know them why would you trust them over anyone spreading positive news. Or hold their word against a $60+ billion market cap

I don't think you understand: the only people with the knowledge to really speak to the finer points of cryptocurrency are those who have invested the time to study it. I've been working in the space for three years and am still learning every day. You can listen to people like Jamie dimon if you'd like, he'll tell you this is shit. I've met with a few people on the blockchain team at JP though so... take his word as you'd like.

You didn't provide new information... that's the fucking point.

500 bits for allowing me to read this. Very interesting.

I'm asking questions, your aggressive and diminutive attitude helps no one and make those like myself who subscribe to both subreddits more amenable to the claims on r btc that censorship of discussion occurs here. I'm not looking for a circle jerk, I'm legitimately asking. How is it that putting in a new system (segwit, bip 148 or other) rather than just increasing or removing the block size limit (something satoshi played with in 2010) is more true to the original idea? If you're going to defend or attack this sub or the other I don't want you to reply. If you'll answer my question I will be very receptive and as always looking to learn more. I don't have a strong opinion on this because I'm under informed, but when I go to learn and am hit with bullshit like your reply it certainly predisposes me to think the other side is correct. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 11:41:06
How would increasing block size without forcing a hard fork be an alt coin? Segwit would be much closer to alt coin?
@_date: 2016-07-12 11:41:28
I cannot disagree with this at all.

I think you misunderstood- I very much support the reasoning behind bitcoin. I think it is an excellent idea and well put together. I first invested in bitcoin in August 2013 (a mix of luck and interest) and have been studying and teaching about it since. I am the founder of the local chapter of the cryptocurrency club at my university. I also helped 2 universities in Israel (where I've been living and working for the past 6 months) set up clubs. The clubs are all chapters of the College Cryptocurrency Network. 
I also hold the belief that I don't need to use bitcoin because I have access to banks and a currency which I can trust. I believe the third world will drive bitcoin in next 5, 10 and 20 years- people who don't have access to a relatively stable currency will be the every day users. 
Basically- I don't need to use bitcoin. I am a speculative investor and treat my bitcoin like I treat my gold- I don't spend it and plan to hold for the long term. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 19:48:03
That's the idea of bitcoin. Many speculative investors aren't here for that. Personally I don't need that feature and circle serves my needs perfectly.

Makes sense. Liquidity is an issue all throughout crypto markets. I used to be an assistant for a few PM's at a large hedge fund mostly fixed income and fx, but I recently met with them to give them an update on cryptos and the landscape in general. The meeting ended with 'unless you want to invest in a fund like pantera you don't have the liquidity you need. These guys are all managing over 200mm so they are disappointed they can't get involved at size.

Do you not know anything about tumblers? You get different coins than you sent in and coming from
Multiple wallets so it's not just '30 btc in to wallet x then immediately 30btc out to wallet y'. Totally untraceable unless I'm Missing something
