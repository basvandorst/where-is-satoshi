Thanks for that. I still don't understand why FSS have larger transactions but I'll keep reading. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 00:31:35
What are you talking about? Lots of devs have make it their life's work to work on bitcoin core, simply because they want the economic benefit of bitcoin to be realized some day.
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:37:22
All of the "good" arguments I have heard for not raising the block size are theoretical. I suspect it's similar to how a pediatrician can sometimes worry too much over the health of their own children because they deal with sick children on a daily basis. Even though they know the things they worry about are quite rare. 
I see people like Greg Maxwell in a similar way. They are so embedded in their field, so exposed to the insane number of attack vectors of a PKI system that they are over cautious. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:25:09
Oh I get it now. You can't just decrease the change output because it is locked. There is no way for a miner to differentiate between a payment and a change address. Therefore the transaction must be larger. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:18:42

Lol fair enough. I think I am especially annoyed with recasting. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:40:31

If bitcoin actually takes off, it means we have somehow found a way for stupid people to handle cryptography safely. That's almost a bigger accomplishment.
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:06:44
And how much centralization do we currently have with 1mb? As far as I know, nobody has come up with a solid metric yet. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:39:59
I'm asking how many legitimate examples people can imagine. If it's not very many that I would not consider it to be an important feature. (efficiency aside) 
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:43:35
There is definitely a balance between never changing the consensus code and regieme uncertainty. I'm glad the Wladimir is erring on the side of predictably. That being said the whole process could be formalised a little better. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:54:22
Yeah it would depend on the size of the mempool at the time. But any transactions with sufficiently large fees should make it into both chains. 
Not sure what you mean by different consensus rules, you mind elaborating? 
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:48:33
1 beer @_date: 2015-06-01 16:01:41
So 14 so far? I thought it would be more. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:04:51
It basically allow more than 8 peers. Otherwise you are only downloading and not uploading. Just Google bitcoin  8333.
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:28:07
I agree. You can't just say "raising the block size will decrease decentralisation". Compared to what? What is the cost of this increase in centralization? What hard evidence do you have? 
Staying with the status quo should not be considered the "safe" position. Doing nothing is just as serious a decision as doing something. Counter-proposal or GTFO. 
That said I don't suspect Greg's motives. That's a serious accusation and requires serious evidence.

Nah, still a huge improvement without that. It's not like they ever had any incentive to innovate before bitcoin started nipping their heels.
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:32:10
They really did a great job. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:30:57
Unless we can define failure conditions, I'm not sure how important relative changes are. What is the maximum acceptable level of centralization? 
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:09:58
Yes that is the downside- if it becomes less profitable. Since in the long run they want more fees, bigger blocks should make them more profitable.
Also, if bigger blocks make the blockchain more valuable, the theory is that will make the bitcoin exchange rate go up- also making mining more profitable.
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:17:43
I saw they switched to a new dust jacket and I like it a lot better.
@_date: 2015-06-17 23:54:09
Why not put 5% as a hedge? Nobody is saying it's not risky.
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:37:21
Transactions should be mined on both chains. Look at what happens when there is an orphaned block, which is technically a fork. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:56:05
He definitely blew that out of proportion. The fork would only really affect new coins from the block subsidy. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:42:24
No. What is happening right now is the core devs (the experts) presenting their recommendations to the community. Ultimately they will need to sell their idea to all the miners and full nodes- who will be the ultimate deciders.
This is how is should be. The decision should be made on after a careful examination of the risks and rewards, and re-examined in the future as necessary. It should not be from reading tea leaves or trying to interpret what satoshi though, or what he might think differently now.
@_date: 2015-06-22 01:25:38
I'm saying investment into bitcoin infrastructure could be made by investors hoping to benefit from externalities. Lighthouse is a good example of this happening. Other devs just donate time.
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:02:54
Sure. But most transactions would be fine. Merchants would still see the example you provided as a double spend attempt. I still think the author's language was hyperbolic. 
On tx malleability, does that mean if a malicious party changed the tx id on one of the chains, you could no longer spend those two utxo with the same transaction?  I didn't realise that the tx id needed to match. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 00:46:33
More likely they just fork his code into bitcoin core and call it a day.
@_date: 2015-06-02 22:28:06
He made a brain wallet from something in the whitepaper.
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:35:42
Well said. For that reason I think whatever the core devs decide for a governance model will be fine. The core devs have both the ability and motivation to do a good job. Their motivation comes from the existential threat of an outsider proposing a hard fork, similar to what Gavin has done with XT.
I think the only person who is against raising the block limit on principal is luke-jr. If you read the mailing lists the positions of most of the core devs is very nuanced. Anybody trying to paint this as a black and white issue is being disingenuous.
Even if raising the block limit is the right thing to do, there are still good arguments and bad arguments. I think it's important to remember it's possible to support raising the block limit while at the same time pointing out that argument "X" to raise the block limit is a really bad argument.
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:04:07
No no no. As soon as he loses the money someone has to go and burn a bunch of food and houses. Gone forever!

It really changes nothing; it's a political choice. I favour runtime configuration because it removes the illusion of dependence on the core devs.

Sorry it's the hardcover version. My mistake. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:14:25

What's wrong with FSS RBF long term? 
@_date: 2015-06-09 15:28:53


Exactly. This is not even a real disagreement on ideology, just disagreements on tuning variables and the timing of those changes.
To keep things on topic (for or against the block size limit) we really need to focus on three questions:  
1. Compared to what?  
2. At what cost?  
3. What hard evidence do you have for it?
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:43:31
Fair enough. I edited my comment to add "(efficiency aside)" 
@_date: 2015-06-23 16:07:34
Compared to what? "increasing centralization" is pretty meaningless without empirical data. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:30:23
The previous forks all jumped in adoption very sharply after the first threshold was passed. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:06:45
Hmm.. is an orphan block the same as wasted hashpower?
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:32:34
Wow. This would be a great innovation if they came up with it prior to 2009.
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:13:19
It seems to me if it had not found the block- it would have been hashing anyway. Ceteris paribus it's not wasted.
@_date: 2015-06-09 01:59:36
If there is a fork the only thing that will happen is miners will need to be on the same fork as exchanges (or whoever's buying) where they want to sell their new coinbase coins. Unless you are planning on spending new coins, it's not an issue really.
Miners basically never want this to happen, so it's likely they will just go along with the exchanges and merchants. If they need to produce smaller blocks due to orphaning they can set their own soft limit.
@_date: 2015-06-18 00:37:54

There is already a bootstrap.dat torrent, but I can't seem to find a link. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:51:08
Ah I see what you mean. Actually I am working on a project I call "torrent file system" which can be used to leverage the existing torrent protocol to sync a changing data structure. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:26:21
They are working on pruning the blockchain now so spent transactions can be deleted. I think the latest version of bitcoin core has partial support. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:53:45
If you have properly configured port 8333, then yes. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:36:44
We do have precedent for this.
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:03:01
It's a really nice design either way. I like how the gold blocks represent the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:28:45
Yeah, that should be a priority. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 15:32:41
I'm comparing FSS RBF and RBF. Can you explain why miners would make more with one or the other? 
@_date: 2015-06-03 15:56:28
I fucking love data. Especially after so much vitriol.
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:32:34
Wow. This would be a great innovation if they came up with it prior to 2009.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:45:52
Yeah I can see how it would be reasonable to assume that nodes will increase as the userbase increases, but with spv wallets this is not guaranteed. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 01:44:02
Nah, still a huge improvement without that. It's not like they ever had any incentive to innovate before bitcoin started nipping their heels.
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:30:45
HTTPS has only recently not been completely fucked to use. Before you could get dropped down to http and the average person would never notice the little lock icon is missing.
The bitcoin community is pretty much just tech people at this point, and we've had tons of issues with bad rng's with no warnings, popular software being used and later finding out that nobody actually reviewed the code and they were using Math.random().
Just imagine what would happen if we had a less biased population. It would be a disaster. I think bitcoin will be the motivation to actually build solutions. We already have trezor, and Google's project vault looks promising. But keeping the average person safe without the tech evolution would be pretty much impossible.
@_date: 2015-06-19 15:15:03
What's your position on this? FSS RFB seems fine, where RFB seems dangerous. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:37:14
Is that factoring in the changes to the way full nodes are counted? Apparently the old method counted unstable or poorly connected nodes. 
Also, the rise of spv wallets would understandably interfere with things. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:05:10
Yes the orphan rate is how likely you are to enter and lose a race. It makes sense that this number would increase as the block size increases. The interval between blocks is random and follows a [Poisson distribution]( How to calculate probabilities of those are beyond me.
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:37:42

The real value in bitcoin as a currency is that I am not forced to use it. If Gavin fucks something up, I am perfectly free to sell everything for dollars, gold, whatever. This is the existential threat that keeps devs honest.
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:33:06
There is still a fire under their ass to come to some agreement quickly. I'm not sure I can imagine a situation so contentious that a miner would risk their entire business to delay ending the fork. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 11:08:11
Although I agree with you, I don't see that happening soon. I see the core devs as mostly committed to ideology, and bitcoin business committed to increasing the exchange rate. Once we see significant conflict I think we will see stronger assertions by the business community about who is really in charge.
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:12:55

@_date: 2015-06-02 00:44:53

Looks the same to me. Also, I can confirm that the skewed image indeed scans to 1HifGYmFUaN2RJTR7a92Dz7rAKqcdNcC9g.
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:23:30
Yeah I would assume that such a fork would be short lived, simply because miners are disproportionately affected. Their coinbase coins are worthless if they are on the wrong block. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 01:10:54
Yes. The orphan rate depends on the block size that the miner found. In fact they could also alleviate this issue by simply self-limiting the size of the blocks they find- since they pretty much just care about the subsidy at this point.
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:26:48
Edited for clarity. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 15:39:22
Are there any use cases for this type of double spend? I can't think of a legitimate use. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:11:42
I'm thinking eventually we will have a checkpoint database to bootstrap from. I can't imagine downloading the blockchain in 100 years, but maybe network and storage tech will make that trivial. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 14:52:13
My interpretation of it was that it's simply better to be explicit than implicit. 
We're in for more drama either way when we hit the 32mb limit because there will need to be changes to split the blocks into multiple packets. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:03:25
Just as example, the consensus code in bitcoin core is written without floating point operations. Even within C++ simply using floating point is off limits because of various hardware implementation differences. 
Now imagine how hard it is to implement this in a new language without risk of accidental fork. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:57:22
That's absolutely true. Less profitability just means more miners drop out until it becomes profitable again.
Miners are also very interested in the bitcoin exchange rate remaining high- otherwise they also go out of business.
I'm really just asking because I'm curious how to calculate the orphan rate.
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:11:30
Decentralization is not a binary thing. There is a balance between more and less decentralization that is cost effective. The problem is it's pretty hard to measure, so deciding how much decentralization is "enough" is not an easy question.
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:38:22
I meant that sending coins to the wrong address should be considered a user error, and with properly designed wallets should be rare. As a use case I would not give it much priority.

@_date: 2015-06-25 19:50:52
It's due to the fact that other blockchains are direct competition to bitcoin market share. Competition is good, it keeps bitcoin devs honest. But there is a certain level of animosity there. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:42:57
Yeah that makes sense. I forgot that the miner needs to know what transactions need to be removed from the mempool. Shouldn't be a problem if the mempool is fairly small anyway. Hopefully IBLT is ready by the time it starts filling up.

He seems to be saying it's winner take all- which does not preclude another alt talking over.
As with Overstock, I think there is a naive idea that it is good to diversify in case another altcoin takes over. Altcoin developers capitalize on this and make grand claims hoping to pump and dump. If you are going to diversify into alts you should really have at least a basic understanding of the technology or you are going to get scammed.

Things that need to be confirmed quickly (e.g. coffee) are generally things that are inexpensive. Considering how expensive it would be to get some hanky panky going with the miners this doesn't seem likely. Miners have an incentive to not destroy bitcoin, that would be like killing the golden goose.
In any case, the easy solution is to sell gift cards. Off-chain transactions will need to get more popular anyway because of the 7 txps limit.

Global read lock? [From what I read about nosql]( there are the "high availability" and the "high consistency" types and various shades in between. Sounds like mongo is tuned to be "high consistency".
If you're doing something that has a lot of read/writes/modify couchdb might be good. It sounds like they are high availability and when a field is edited by two people at the same time then both writes are stored and it is left to you to sort out how to resolve it. Been a long time since I looked at it though.

No. Blocks will be generated approx every 10 min regardless of the hash rate. There is no way to reduce the risk of double spending other than waiting for more blocks to be generated. When the transaction is included in a block that is called 1 confirmation. When another block is added on top of that it is called 2 confirmations, and so on. When the number of confirmations reaches a certain value (usually 6) it is just generally considered confirmed.
What a payment corporation could do is off-chain transactions. They can transfer bitcoins between people that are both account holders, and publish the result to the block chain at the end of the day. I think this is what we will start to see of quick confirmation time matters or if transaction fees get too high.

There may be none. It's possible that bitcoin banks would be fraught with bank runs. 
I think the relative ease with which you can be your own bank using bitcoin would provide incentives for banks to be much more risk averse. In the gold days you were pretty much forced to use a bank or risk being robbed. Bitcoin bank customers have the ability to be much more fickle since they can easily and safely store hundreds of bitcoins "in their mattress".

Peter made almost the same comment so I'll just repeat myself:
There are a few assumptions being made. It's seems you are fine with the idea of miners deciding if mining was to remain decentralized, but the evidence is that mining will become more centralized to reduce costs. You go on to show how even a centralization of 30% can lead to short-sighted behavior.
There are two questions I have:  
1) Is the centralization of mining pools is "effectively" decentralized, since miners can easily switch pools?  
2) When estimating the duration for short-sighted vs. long-sighted, don't miners have to at least have a long enough time-frame to see a reasonable ROI on their mining hardware? As miners become more and more centralized and profits get slimmer, wouldn't that also extend their minimum time-frame by more and more?
@_date: 2015-05-30 17:11:48
I don't think the incentives work out for an attack to be successful. An attacker is basically setting a floor for transaction cost. The higher the floor, the more expensive an attack. If there is currently ~2000 max transactions per block, to enforce a $1 fee floor the attacker might need to spend up to $2000 every 10 min, or ~$300k a day.
At $1 min fee bitcoin would still be valuable as a remittance service and store of value. Miners would love the extra cash, so the attack would actually contribute to the security of the network.
At $100 min fee bitcoin would be almost useless for everything except a store of value, but the attack would cost ~$30 million a day. The only people who are likely to come up with that kind of money are governments who have access to the fiat printing press- but in so doing would devalue their currency.

Nobody has to accept anything. People already have the ability to modify any bitcoin code and run it. What I am proposing is just a different way to reach consensus, one where I think we will lead us to pick a good max block limit. Consensus does not require 100% approval, just a majority. I already described what I think would happen in the worst case (a 50-50 split). In any other case it's obvious what the majority is and the others should switch or be left behind.
I'm not sure how to respond to your analysis that one rogue miner generating 1tb blocks to be a realistic issue. Either they are a minority and we ignore them, or we update the limit up or down as I described in another post.
I think the important thing to remember is that bitcoin miners and nodes are interested in increasing bitcoin's value. I don't really see an argument from game theory here for market failure since bitcoin is a long-run game and people are allowed to change the rules at any time.

The guy who made the fluid dispenser implemented it.
Doesn't this multiply the number of transaction fees by at least two though? Otherwise  putting both of your inputs in the same transaction would defeat the purpose. At least until coin join because more popular.
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:04:17
Yeah that's true. Is that a big deal? I don't think so. In this context the cause of the fork would be a very large block that nobody expected. Say 50% accept the block and 50% don't so we have a fork. At this point bitcoin should still work properly because all the transactions would still make it into both chains, but it is something that would need to be resolved quickly. Fortunately, solving the issue is pretty simple. If the block was an attack, 50% of the network would crash trying to process it. The other 50% would continue on fine, and the other people would quickly adjust their block limit to slightly lower than the block that cause the problem and reboot their client. If it turns out the block went through without any issues then 50% of the people should just increase their block limit since there is now proof that it's not an issue.
The more interesting case is when a block is just big enough to start to cause issues. Then there would be widespread discussion on the need to all agree on the same block limit. However, that is going to be a much more informed discussion than the one we are currently having, since there will be real evidence for a safe value.
@_date: 2015-05-07 04:12:11
That sounds pretty awesome.
I had assumed that miners would be trusted to decide on a block limit among themselves. They would want to keep the block size to a level that allowed full nodes to operate on reasonable networks on reasonable hardware. They are, after all, most interested in the exchange rate of bitcoin to fiat and a healthy miner-full node relationship affects that greatly. Their incentive is to make no hint of regime uncertainty.
@_date: 2015-05-14 03:52:07
Yeah it seems like they use a decreasing ttl to allow the transaction to propagate like "lightning" through the nodes, until eventually a node that has the destination address receives the transaction. Seems like even banning one transaction would be cause to never use that node again.

That graph is very confusing. How did those tx suddenly disappear on 15 and 23? There are too many for a block, and blocks are 10 min, not once a day.

It is incredible that "deflation is bad" has become such a common belief. I think it stems from the fact that there was deflation during the Great Depression, post hoc ergo propter hoc. 
The theory of deflation causing the Great Depression usually takes this form: If you have a deflationary currency, people are motivated to hold onto money rather than spend it. This reduces aggregate consumption and sends the economy into a tailspin. What this fails to take into account is the time preferences different people have. Some people are natural savers, they pinch their pennies even if they are holding a inflationary currency. However, at a certain point, all people will value what they can buy now more than how much they can buy later, even if later they will have greater purchasing power due to deflation.
The easiest example is food, if you save your money for 3 years to buy food with your greater purchasing power, you'd starve. This time preference appears in lot of other purchases that are not essential to life. Take computers in  the 90's. If you bought one there would be a newer and cheaper computer in the store before you even got home. Yet, people bought computers in droves. In fact, in America during the 19th century, one of the greatest economic booms in the American history, the dollar was deflating the entire time.

Transactions are visible at 0 conf as soon as they are posted. They are not necessarily going to get 1 conf when the next block is found- only if they were included in the block. They will remain unconfirmed (0 conf) until they are included in a block.

Well miners do have a little extra power in being able to set a smaller limit against the will of merchants. But yeah, major merchants, wallet providers, and miners would all have to agree in order to raise the limit.
If it is with these people where the actual power of consensus lies, it seems unclear to me what someone means when they say "we shouldn't let miners control" the block size by making it a command line arg. It really changes nothing.

There are a few assumptions being made. It's seems you are fine with the idea of miners deciding if mining was to remain decentralized, but the evidence is that mining will become more centralized to reduce costs. You go on to show how even a centralization of 30% can lead to short-sighted behavior.
There are two questions I have:  
1) Is the centralization of mining pools is "effectively" decentralized, since miners can easily switch pools?  
2) When estimating the duration for short-sighted vs. long-sighted, don't miners have to at least have a long enough time-frame to see a reasonable ROI on their mining hardware? As miners become more and more centralized and profits get slimmer, wouldn't that also extend their minimum time-frame by more and more?
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:14:30
You should take a look at what I am working on: 
I don't know if you write Java, but I was thinking about implementing a similar thing using encryption. You just pay for the decryption key with bitcoin, but the torrent protocol remains unchanged.

I support block limits, I just want to let miners and full nodes to decide what they should be. It's really just to prevent spam attacks, we shouldn't need consensus at the bitcoin core level for that.

I think creating an extremely simple bitcoin wallet ap for ios is a fantastic idea. I'm not sure why so many haters.
I think multisig is a great option for making the app extremely easy to use while providing security. I don't think having 2 options during registration is necessary- someone who knows what they are doing will not be using this app. 
I would allow the option for someone to upload a key to a multisig address, however. That way a knowledgeable person can set up an account for someone, and from then on it's easy. Trusting you to generate the addresses should not be required.
I'm not clear on how you plan to use local storage. Could you elaborate on that? I'm thinking that during registration the user would download an encrypted private key for backup. A second encrypted private key would be securely sent to the app (I'm not sure about the details here, it sounds like you might be making a web app so this is not possible). The third encrypted private key is kept on your servers.
I understand that you do not want to be open source while you are developing, but after you launch I think this is absolutely necessary. The only reason I say this is because even though people are probably only storing small amounts of money on this wallet, this could actually be a lot of money if you can steal from everyone at once. This is so tempting you can be guaranteed that someone will try to hack it. Your best defence against this is whitehats auditing your code for you.

Similarly with segwit it would need a 95% activation threshold, you can't have some people using it and some people not. If you are not upgraded to segwit you will see segwit transactions as "anyone can spend" transactions.

I usually hear keynesian when someone talks about their models.
I hope you take that as a lighthearted jab. I'm seeing "economists think ___" thrown about here as if economists are some uniform group.

I thought of that, but then it occurred to me that the same person can control multiple pools. Or does p2pool somehow avoid this?

He's probably going to hold some bitcoin now that they accept it. Trading for goods and services is cheaper than mtgox.

Can you provide a link?

Good lord, the amount of downvotes in this thread...
Don't people understand that this is exactly the problem bitcoin aims to solve? People should be able to voluntarily exchange whatever good/services they agree on. If his boss no longer wants to trade with dollars, who are we to regulate him?
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:31:04
That's brutal. They should spawn a sister discount site that only accepts bitcoin to work around that problem.

Well for smaller transactions it's probably fine to let itself sort out.
For larger transactions, I would be interested in seeing transactions insurance companies. For a percentage fee they would insure transactions against companies that they have investigated and found no suspicion of fraud.

Wow I'm glad to see that Bob supports bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:21:29
Well there may or may not be a good insurance business model for it.
But to speculate: An insurance company would be much better at assessing risks due to doing business with someone. This would be their day job- investigating businesses and based on the riskiness assess a percent fee for the transaction. They would probably develop a voluntary system where businesses allow inspections and submit to audits in order to lower their risk profile. Sometimes they would make a mistake and have to pay out- that's the nature of insurance.

I'm not sure what problem that would solve.You would not need to change the protocol, just have everybody agree that we start calling mBtc "bitcoins" as an abbreviations. It's more likely we develop some nickname for mBtc that is convenient.

I think when trezor is launched and ordinary people have a way of securing their bitcoins. I.e. Mass adoption will drive merchant adoption. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:05:34
That's pretty cool. I'm still amazed that 20 cents can travel across borders in no time at all. Just imagine crowdfunding charities when this really takes off.

Hey guys I found the keynesian.

Bitcoin has an artificial limit of 7 tps.

The general idea is that the offline storage is your "bank". The coin in your online computer/smartphone is your "spending money".
Just like in real life you could get mugged so you only carry around a small amount of cash at any one time, and keep the rest in the bank. So with bit coin you keep most of you coin offline, and a modest amount on your smartphone.

I think the trust thing will sort itself  out in the long run. Companies that value customer trust will stick around for a long time and customer will trust companies with a good track record and a strong brand.

Looks like the mods removed it. Oh well, the guy in the bazaar will tell them about it.

I thought it was 7 zeros

I wonder how regulated the Indian market is against setting up an exchange. This could be a nice opportunity to meet some untapped demand.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:05:56
Variations in price are cause by market entry, market exit, and speculation.
The rapid market entry we are seeing will end when bitcoin adoption becomes relatively complete. I have no idea when this will happen.
Market exit does not appear to be happening currently, but it could happen if major bitcoin holders (ex. early adopters/miners) cash out. I have no idea if this will ever happen, or how long it could last.
Rampant speculation will end when a long-term trust has been build up surrounding bitcoin has been established. I have no idea when this will happen.
**tl;dr** I have no idea.

I don't really entertain the idea of increasing the 21m limit. Inflationary currency is against the philosophy of bitcoin so it would never be accepted.
Changing the divisibility of bitcoin does not cause inflation. An analogy to draw would be if we re-introduced the half-penny. This has no effect on the purchasing power of the money already in your bank account.
I'm not sure how forks are handled when extensions are added. I'll have to read up on that.

I'm not even sure how to pay taxes on bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:03:48
Good. A lot of people are hoping for a crash so they can buy more bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:08:06
That is not a paranoid idea at all. Keeping a wallet on dropbox is perfectly fine as long as you use a good encryption method. The one I hear recommended most around here is truecrypt.
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:31:41
Extensions to bitcoin are inevitable and in no way stop it from being "bitcoin". We  will probably raise the 7 tps limit and also increase the fractional limit a bitcoin can be divided into.
