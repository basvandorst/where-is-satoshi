I have been approached by people badly hooked up in Bitcoin. Yesterday in a small Leocoin event in my town where i was presenting,a guy showed up talking about Bitcoin.
They were told to buy in because Bitcoin would go to the moon! At 800 dollar they were cheap coins they were told! Buy now or get left behind!
As it turned out these people telling them to buy at 800 just wanted to get rich themselves! They needed other people to buy in to make their own coins worth more. You could call it a pyramid really. 
The worst part is now these 800 dollar a coin bagholders are doing exactly the same thing because they want their money back!
Yeah, those evil and horrible, worthless alt-coins! Nothing but scams!

No, they don't accept Bitcoin. They really don't. 
This misleading article has already been voted to the mainpage. Please stop posting this crap. 
Edit: can the downvoters maybe tell me why i'm being downvoted? Where am i wrong?

What baby steps? They aren't accepting Bitcoin. Period. How is that baby steps?
Maybe the downvoters also like to comment on their downvoting. I'd like to know their reasoning.

I'm sure it's completely different today.

So last week the same article was posted with the ridiculous title that 78% of the people wanted to use Bitcoin and voted to the top of the mainpage. 
This place is a riot. 
Anyway, your polling argument is dumb. Very dumb.

Probably some scam as with pretty much any service that offers Bitcoin discounts. But Bitcoiners prefer to ignore that part.
