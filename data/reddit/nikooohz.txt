@_date: 2018-01-31 01:03:10
pump and dump.. its been going since christmas. pump, dump, pump, dump, repeat. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:45:46
you fucked up bro, bitmain only takes bitcoin cash (BCH). they havent been taking bitcoin (BTC) after last october.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:40:23
yeah im betting that btrash came to meet its maker.. shouldve sold at 2k stupid me. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:51:28
what a joke, so people pay to be scammed even more?
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:09:39
thats why you gpu mine alts, bitmain is horrible, old tech 2x price better wait for new big thing.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:30:59
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:43:14
yes sell! your hands are too weak to hodl thru this.
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:40:55
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:30:54
probably satoshi himself
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:29:09
took over 2 weeks for me so... cex.io takes 10minutes try that.
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:07:41
sorry but this makes no sense whatsoever.. put 10btc on random wallet &amp; you pay 1k for what? yeah right... why do the person need new wallet? why does it have to be 10btc? sounds like a scam fool.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:55:34
considering 1 s9 antminer with psu is around +2500$ from bitmain, but good luck getting any from their batches, they get sold in bulks instantly so it's 3500$ from the reseller. original price of s9 was 1200$ back in the day. thats kinda horrible that 1-2 years ago same machine went -2x lower in price. im also pretty sure OP is right and they already have new antminers running for themselves, they are selling old tech out.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:42:27
have a up vote, just because i hate coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:44:21
you are an idiot if you pay that much... there is a option to set your own fee you know?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:42:00
there is no reason it wouldn't grow back to +20k so i suggest buying.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:35:48
lool. litecoin is copy paste bitcoin, even the core owns litecoin.. you gotta be really dumb to toss money from bitcoin to litecoin. bitcoin cash is another story.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:05:29
yeah bro you are right the ponzi scheme bubble is about to pop.. worthless shitcoins.
noone cares dude, go use western union lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:19:47
yeh btc has been falling whole week now... i think this actually might be the crash. my hands are getting really weak now.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:58:07
[yeah it did]( 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:22:39
first mistake was to actually believe anything you see in r/btc .. place is a joke. everybody is full retarded at r/btc why would you go there?
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:58:24
you are a moron for even considering paying taxes on something government cant control. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:55:27
difference between them = bitcoin is bitcoin &amp; bitcoin cash is shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:46:44
how to look like a total idiot 101
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:35:23
this is exactly the reason why you should've not bought in the first place lmao
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:02:09
did you expect crypto was get rich quick scheme?
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:53:33
"more stable" only reason they are more stable cause it's like 1-5% of people using them from bitcoins market.  ofc it's more stable cause there is literally no sells &amp; barely buys compared to btc. 
200 dip on bitcoin is like 10 cent dip on litecoin bro
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:40:33
+25k... fuck fiat &amp; HODL
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:36:04
its the elite / whales buying &amp; selling... buying at 12-14k &amp; after that it jumps to 16-19k they instantly sell forcing price to dip back... easy profit if you are a billionare. price only goes up when regular people buy. these whales just make profit for themselves, it shows as massive small time gain then instant drops.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:08:11
you are talking out of your ass, i see shitposts like this on daily basis bro.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:21:59
i dont think you'd be asking this question if you actually had 600 million $ worth of BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:43:34
shitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:10:57
2x more than original price.. lmfao! fuck bitmain &amp; their shit 2 year old overprized miners, bitfury gonna take the game up real soon.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:30:57
idiots who didnt buy any are salty af calling it a bubble �� everytime i see the comments im glad im not on of them &amp; got in. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:25:06
really bruh? did someone just pull a scam from early 2000?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:51:34
yeah price is going unusually weird.. just look at the 1D spikes.. definetly some wall street type of manipulation going on right now
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:55:08
bitcoin cash is dead by january lmao
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:52:24
[yeah]( 
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:32:48
hahahah! roger is a man child, just like all bcash muppets. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:40:38
who cares, it takes 1 minute to think &amp; make this kind of meme lmao, i doubt he even was the first person to think about this meme. i know ive seen it before
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:56:01
back in last september/december im sure someone made &amp; posted very similiar meme.
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:34:51
yeah his a little kid in grown mans body
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:31:05
yes, i just saw the play token promotion on their site.. claiming it was for 3 trillion dollar business. i went to the site it was small online betting &amp; gambling site lmfao. 3 trillion dollar business my ass. worst scam ico i had ever seen
@_date: 2018-05-14 11:20:09
good stuff
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:06:52
i was looking into mining ethereum &amp; trading in for bitcoin, yeah seems like way overprize tho :p
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:16:24
just like xrp &amp; other shitcoins with endless supplys
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:22:57
why did he get 2 lifes +40 years &amp; the 2.0 owner got released? didnt they basically commit the same crime? 
cant wrap my head around how owning &amp; operating an internet site gets you 90 years in prison..
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:07:51
what ever is going on with your situation just know never to use coinbase for other than checking btc price.. i've had NOTHING but bad experience with them. i would never ever personally go back to them it's so bad..
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:18:16
what a fucking scam.. these fees are jokes
@_date: 2019-02-17 09:19:24
ofc it does, or do you not know how btc works? halving the blockreward means miners get half the reward = cost around 6k to mine 1btc. nobody will sell btc for less than mining costs. thats the only way bitcoins are generated my friend
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:25:56
bitcoin cash is something r/btc mongoloids think can over take bitcoin, in reality bitcoin cash is worthless &amp; is going to die off within a year. stick with bitcoin forget about bitcoin cash, gold, diamond all scams.
@_date: 2019-02-11 05:43:35
bull is fucking the bear in the ass, thats how it should be.
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:45:32
im from europe but thought it was 25 lol, anyways i find it weird how he got it this harsh while other guy goes free?
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:04:16
coinbase is a scam &amp; if you use it you must be stupid or new to bitcoins
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:02:55
coinbase is garbage!! i would not recommend it to anyone.. they have massive fees &amp; retarded limits, no proper support... worst possible exchange you could go with.. also CEX is pos.. just use localbitcoin or GDAX... coinbase is scam, fraud, worst exchange on the market!
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:20:38
stay away from CEX they are pretty much a scam market
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:55:14
thats right, im preparing for next dip to buy in. holding is the key, i believe that bitcoin keeps rising like it has done before, theres always dips &amp; thats the time to buy ;)
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:37:05
waste of money don't even think about it
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:25:04
it's not my job. like i said they didn't state the not supported countries anywhere.. obviously their fault. this is just one of the many problems coinbase has. they will fuck you over too just wait..
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:09:03
what the hell is bitcoin diamond?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:51:43
they cant ban BTC only exchanges &amp; miners. that happened in china
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:12:53
scam by me sending them 50$ via SEPA 4 months ago. they stated NOWHERE they dont accept SEPA from my country, well after 2 weeks i contacted them wheres the money i sent.. they replied with sorry we dont support sepa from your country... it took 2 months from the deposit to get a refund. thats how bad it is..
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:31:58
it took almost 2 months for coinbase to refund the transfer i made. contact their support if you havent already only way they are gonna refund the transfer. funny how they dont make it obvious what country sepa is supported
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:32:38
ffs i meant euros instead of $..
@_date: 2019-02-17 09:17:03
lol, biggest bullshit ive seen since last bullshit chart i saw.. btc will not be 3000$ in january 2020 not even close mark my words.
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:58:29
why are you complaining about stupid things? nobody cares dude
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:27:29
so what you are saying is people shouldnt get into bitcoin anymore? you are talking like this is the end of bitcoin.. it's just the beginning lol. by 5 + year horizon if you mean holding. you are right!
@_date: 2019-02-27 06:38:34
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:59:49
typical coinbase, don't expect answer anytime soon.. their support usually takes around 1-4 months to answer. stay away from this scam exchange
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:12:45
do you? it was obviously only 50 to test it out dumbass and glad it wasn't more. or do you think im not from europe? piece of shit conbase didnt accept sepa from a sepa country.. isnt it funny???
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:22:49
well yeah if you wanna pay massive fees, have low limits &amp; have transfers taking weeks.. rookie market lol
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:02:20
dude... dragon mint is a scam lmao. still not a single miner has ever been shipped to anyone and they were supposed to ship first batch january. it's a vaporware company 100%.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:00:17
ive had no problems with bitmain, halong is a scam for me untill their miners actually get shipped.. i remember looking at their site last year around november it said shipping of first batch january / february
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:49:58
noobie question... short answer: wont happen.
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:03:54
crypto is in a casket right now waiting to be put 6ft under.. im still holding tho
@_date: 2019-01-09 05:57:32
there was no btc back in 2007 bro
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:46:25
banks? lmfao... there are people with way more money than whole us banks so no.
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:55:26
pm me the coupon if i win
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:46:47
bought at 6k and been holding ever since... shame to see it go this low again, im afraid it will hit 0 real soon but fuck it im still going to hodl. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 05:24:26
thanks for the heads up, gonna uninstall and delete my wallet from them.
@_date: 2017-09-03 02:51:12
yeah.. im also trying to buy but not a small amount like 1 BTC but can't find anywhere with small fees / 10 days to verify... if this was easier maybe more people would actually buy into bitcoins...
@_date: 2017-09-03 02:32:12
i get it that you have to have verifications but the damn small charge fee is plain retarded!!! not every bank has these showing up untill 2 days later.. also whats up with coinbase stupid 500e limit? where can i buy with EASY verification no limit? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 02:54:21
lol, like im gonna get a bank just to buy a damn bitcoin. there must be easier way to do this, coinbase is okay with only ID verification why wouldn't other site without limits be? problem is my coinbase has 500e weekly limit &amp; i need +4000e
not to mention my bank might not be fast with tracking payments, but it has superior security.. these kind of verifications are totally useless &amp; stupid with my bank lmfao. you couldn't buy shit even if my card was to be stolen.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:40:59
fud after fud after fud, cant believe all these millions coming in are from dumbasses who panic sell after every FUD... 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:00:49
the ponzi is over guys, it's all over for btc &amp; cryptos!
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:03:19
update if anyone reads this: im back &amp; about to buy btc tomorrow... glad the price is dipping hard now! im happy i didn't get to buy yesterday ;D the country i was in had 1 btc ATM that was closed down... lol!
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:10:00
well fuck it if nobody can give me a site with easy verification like ID guess i just have to wait till tuesday to buy in.. god damn it!
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:16:36
not gonna lie it looks horrible now... no need for media on this one, btc is showing its last breath right now before its gone, sorry.
@_date: 2017-09-03 02:39:19
i can bare with ID verification. small charge verification is literally impossible for me to complete cause it will not show up on my bank till 1-2 days later.. besides its sunday &amp; im out of country i cant call my bank! 
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:01:54
thing i dont get is it's literally easier to buy plane tickets &amp; hotels, pretty much everything. even put plenty of money to online casinos but buying a bitcoin is the hardest thing ever. youd think these things are pretty secure..
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:00:46
ok, if you decide to get one please keep me updated :D i'd like to know how their rigs are :)
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:41:44
bear market, could last years... dont expect it to go over 15k till 2020
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:35:03
that volume of money? are you kidding me? bitcoin has average 3 billion dollar 24h volume how is this even big buy order? 
btw its fake too..
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:23:40
what bull run? how is one whale buy considered as a bull run? please...
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:52:14
bought at 6k shits fucked up 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:50:15
no the ponzi is going down. im guessing it will be around 0-100$ soon.
@_date: 2018-07-29 08:21:34
why is this shit on r/bitcoin ?? wouldnt you think there was more suitable subred for this?
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:32:57
nothing new here
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:36:26
depositing btc has nothing to do with fiat. he never said he was selling it. even if he tried to sell it they have no right to take away his btc. they can simply deny the sell order, they cant take away btc that doesnt belong to them.
what op said happened was that he deposited btc to hitBTC and they took it to themselves. that is not right.
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:23:24
depends how rich... 5 million $ or more probably not. anything less than 2 million.. yes!
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:07:02
sounds like a scam exchange.. a proper exchange doesnt ask you to trace your btc... this is crypto, not a bank &amp; fiat we are talking here. if you mined it in 2010 &amp; found it now by accident how the fuck would you explain it? not like you can trace that shit or have any proper proof there. fuck hitBTC scamming piece of shits. worst exchange ive ever heared by far.. id rather give my cryptos away than deposit a single satoshi on their shit exchange.
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:46:43
that sucks. i mean i had problems with coinbase last year but it was nothing compared to what i just read.
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:26:06
dont get your hopes up its been bouncing like this since december.. nothing new is happening here
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:55:50
we wont reach the end bro, every single one of us is going to be dead decades before last btc is mined
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:26:48
sounds like a scam site bro
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:59:58
thanks for posting this. i will never use their site &amp; i hope this message reaches alot of people. 
ill try to spread the word, hitBTC is a fraud &amp; scam.
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:05:38
i can bet at least 40% is bots
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:04:41
proof that wide spread adoption doesnt pump the price, we had like 300k when btc was 20k. now we at 1 mil &amp; btc at 4k lol!
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:25:49
post this on r/btc and see how many downvotes those mongoloids give you
