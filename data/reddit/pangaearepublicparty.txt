Bitcoin is like having one branch do all the server calculations for the global bank. But all the other branch locations just run stress tests all day for no reason, literally burning electricity for no benefit. 
Bitcoin is just like 100x waste of what’s needed for one centralized server to authenticate transactions. But that waste (aka mining difficulty) just keeps going up exponentially. It’s all a giant scam, let alone these ASIC miners that let the big investment companies control the ledger anyways. 
Not to mention the CIA is running a global gun and drug empire with bitcoin. Just saying... it’s a terrible technology.

This is not a fair comparison. It would be more accurate to compare your local bank power consumption to all of bitcoin.

It’s an environmental disaster no matter how you look at it. It’s digital gold that will never be used at the point of sale. Central bank digital currency backed by gold will kill bitcoin. I sold my crypto when alt coins crashed, it’s proof that bitcoin died as a currency.

No that’s why fiat currency is actually a good thing. For a currency. It’s impossible to have a liquid currency that maintains value over time. That’s where people don’t understand what money is. And what’s a commodity. And an asset.

What happens to all the computing effort that didn’t win the block? Please tell me. It was all for nothing.

It uses 99% less energy than a bunch of bitcoin farms. Point proven thanks. Also, you never get your money back when someone steals your bitcoin.

Only one person wins the calculation. All other computing is an environmental disaster. I don’t need to deal with your bs. Good day

If you divided that on a per transaction basis, I’d bet bitcoin is exponentially higher.. and growing

That is what it appears to be. I’m just saying I don’t know enough to really understand. Like hacking encryption’s essentially is an algorithm. I’m selling my GPU into the void to run algos.
I really do enjoy the user experience of coinhash, many other things I’ve tried have been really tedious and seemingly a waste of time.

I really don’t know enough I just see how things could go wrong with new technologies. The actual number of people who understand crypto code is probably 100-200 people.

Like I said. Wandering thoughts. I’m too busy to actually read white papers :) 
Cheers to the fun

Who knows

I agree to some extent. However the entire point of a pool is that you get more computing power than is possible using AWS. The NSA can only use as much hashing power as a local power plant can provide. However, with nicehash they can essentially buy up 100s of power plants at the snap of a finger to do something.

Yep I like that type of explanation. I do however think there’s very few people that actually understand this stuff to know the government isn’t pulling some trickery.
The environmental disaster alone from discarded blocks is overwhelming, in my worst nightmare I’m not mining bitcoin, I’m helping the government do bad stuff. I really do hope it’s a road to crypto utopia.
