Are you kidding? I'm sure any somewhat modern scanners would detect the metal bits in them. I worked a holiday temp position at an Amazon fulfillment center, one of their big problems was employees unpackaging and stealing SD cards. The detectors picked them up just fine, but the problem was people were good at figuring out how to get them around the scanner.

While I don't agree with increasing the block size as the solution to this problem, you make some really good points. 
For now, why not an 8mb increase? We can always switch back. The main thing I want to see is how the community and protocol can handle some hard fork action, regardless of what it is. We need to get this process down so we don't end up a static protocol that gets traded for an alt in 5 years.

I think something like this would be a good idea, that way you can get around the eventual loss of bitcoins and incentivize miners with something other than fees. And really, who is going to have a load of coin and not touch it for a lifetime? Just move it to a new address and you have another 100 years. Hell, make it 250 years. I don't think there is any excuse at that point that anything other than loss has occurred.

The value and the quantity of a thing are not exchangeable. Just because you see the value double does not mean you can pretend the quantity did instead. Bitcoins are individual collections of transaction data. If four people send you half a bitcoin, your wallet balance will be 2 bitcoin. BUT, the blockchain knows you really have 4 half bitcoins, and it knows what Bitcoin reward they were originally a part of.
Also, to a certain extent...Yes. You can hold a bitcoin in your hand.

Also multisig, and who knows how much  money someone has in their phone? How do you know when you have stolen it all? Are you going to spend the time to root around someone's phone to see if there is a second wallet app that they keep their real spending money in? What if they run away while you are looking through their phone? Now you just have their phone which will be useless as soon as it locks itself... and still no money.

It's important to be precise with our words. OP was starting with the premise that we might be "making" others poor by having an appreciation in btc value. I for one, can't think of other implications than theft when wording in that fashion. At the very least it suggests a sort of immorality. Obviously we don't consider a car dealership immoral or "making us poor" because we decided to buy car, even if we needed one to get to work. I don't see how Bitcoin appreciation would be different from any other asset.

Understand that means the information on a non-mesh network currently needs an isp to access it (google, facebook, everything the general population uses day-to-day). This doesn't have to be the case though. 
As we move forward in time more stuff will be built on the mesh, making it more useful. Also I would bet server hosts for traditional internet will integrate mesh access to their databases and sites, because companies will want to reach as many people as possible.

Well, it is all still conceptual at this point (I don't believe it will pan out). 
But etherium is essentially an alt "coin" being sold as a development platform. the tokens somehow power decentralized applications. They are trying to keep it from being used as a currency. The thing is, the etherium units will still have a value, since they can do useful stuff. People will then do their best to sell them like anything else.
It may work out like the units are tickets to use a percentage of network computing power. This would allow anyone with enough etherium to have access to a "supercomputer"
Again, it could just be a pump and dump

I don't know what to tell you, other than: You need to realize that you aren't risking your money on how well bitcoin is doing, you are risking it on how other people perceive bitcoin is doing. If you expect it to be "fair", or a simple cause/effect then you're gonna have a bad time.

Honestly, that's not true. Bitcoin depends on a communications network, a power grid, and a market with access to affordable technology. It's very easy to make it disappear, and far from being accessible to all. 
Now, once meshnets are the predominant connection and a cell phone from three years ago can run everything you need, I would support the sentiment.

I am not for sure on this but as far as I have read, a 51% attack still leaves a 49% network on its own. It essentially splits and nodes can choose what fork to take if it comes to that. So in practicality after it shakes out, its like the Chinese just left and the network got smaller and easier to mine. 
If someone more knowledgeable would correct/reinforce this I would appreciate it.

@_date: 2014-06-02 20:31:56
I don't have much faith in that. The most unstable areas have crazy currency problems because their government is corrupt. Switching to bitcoin and having to play it straight is not something that will be done by corrupt governments. It's in their financial interests to have a platform they can manipulate. Won't happen with bitcoin, and you saw what happened to aurora.
tldr: No government will switch to bitcoin without a immanent  chance of being rendered obsolete/being killed in riots.

They are holding a shitload of risk. Combined with the fact that they will let you trade in and out at whatever price you want (yea yea, that one guys got refused etc..), its like being able to buy a saw from home depot and return it for more money than you paid.

Supply and demand doesn't require more or less users. Needs can change.
The biggest thing is: bitcoin needs electricity and internet and computers to work. It doesn't care how many people use it. The current model of mining and inflation was chosen to provide a "good enough" solution for an estimation of usage and adoption.

1. Entirely subjective.
2. Entirely subjective.
3. Pre-paid visas work anywhere. If you were really interested in defeating limitations you would get them one. But (as you probably don't know, being a poor gifter and all), the more generic and all-purpose a gift is, the less personal it is. At least a gift card to a single place they like shows that you care about the person and have spent time considering their preferences (the entire point of modern day gift-giving).
You are rationalizing giving gifts to other people that you actually would want for yourself. If you knew these people would like it, you wouldn't have come here looking for validation.

You realize that other than satoshi, the people that started with a lot have lost a lot, or gotten a lot stolen, or got goxxed, or cashed out when the price hit $4, or spent 10,000 BTC on a pizza, or cashed out at $30, etc.
I bet the main reason you troll is because you believe everyone that stands to make real money got in before you, and you don't want to have less than people you deem to have not risked anything.
The people that started with a lot burnt a lot of coins to blaze a trail for us. I find value in that.

- Introduces people to the idea of bitcoin, and it's use as a source of wealth
- Gets people working with unit scales (bits/mb/gb)
- Gives free gem things for watching a bitcoin learning video
- Has an amazing sense of humor. 
- Essentially put r/technology into a blender, introducing and providing short explanations of topics from 3D printed housing to amazon drone delivery.

Well it seems a little generic which is why I asked. The character style and detail of the animation reminds me of the sites online that generate a cartoon for you. I do like that you are putting effort in though.
So reccomendations:
- Stylization
- More detailed animation
- Storyline isn't very developed, it seems like less of a story and more of an idea (people will fight over bitcoin in the future even though they don't value it today) except that you took 45 seconds to say it. Try to work on writing a creative story to encapsulate the original idea.

I will try to make an anecdote about speculative value using a cracked and kind of shiny rock you find while digging. When you pull it out your friend says "oh man that's a *insert precious stone name*" and offers you fifty bucks. But a guy nearby overhears him and he thinks it's big enough to warrant an offer of 150 because he makes jewelry and sells it at a profit. You decide to keep it and take it to a lab/jeweler to test and cut it. After that, you can tell the color isn't perfect, and there is a crack that happens to run right through the middle. Now anyone who sees it will only pay $45 for it. 
What happened to the other $105? Well it disappeared because that value was speculative, and you did not receive it because you did not sell to secure that price. I am not saying bitcoin has turned out to be broken, but that people don't have a good idea of its value yet, and so the numbers you see are what people will throw at it. This will then be influenced in a lot of ways.

Did any of you keep reading?


Which is awful. Especially if you work with crypto for a living. None of this works AT ALL without scarcity. The entire point of bitcoin, and altcoins for that matter, is recording the transfer of a scarce asset. Without scarcity there really is no asset, or at least no reason to record the transfer of it, since there's no value. How do you not get that*?
You can make arguments for supporting alts in your wallet if you like, but to categorically refute the validity of digital scarcity is just asinine.
or maybe I'm just being expertly trolled...?


Let me be clear: I love Bitcoin, I hold Bitcoin, and (for now) we run Hive on it, exclusively... But I still feel that these arguments against other tokens are spurious at best. See my point about semantics.**

@_date: 2014-08-18 15:59:54
The idea is that the bitcoin network is decentralized, as opposed to the centralized traffic system on your show. So you cant really hack them all at once. The blockchain only works in places where there is agreement between most of the computers on the network. Because they are working on the same thing, there is a network. For your example it is the reverse. The city network already has the power to control everything, pre-creating the "agreement" as to what the connected computers work on. Get control of the main system and you control everything.

I think what you are asking is: "does the transaction fee get removed from the amount sent?"
The answer may depend on the wallet, but I believe they all ADD it to the amount you want to send, regardless of how much that is. If they removed it from the amount sent, no one would ever pay enough to buy the things they ordered 
@_date: 2014-07-02 06:13:38
I'm sure they already know a lot about it.
@_date: 2014-09-14 16:26:36
Yes, but this is the case with all things you wish to sell. You have to have a buyer to get any value out of an item you have. For instance in an apocalypse scenario, you may have a sweet ring or a cool electric guitar that cost you thousands of dollars. While it may be worth the money, you may not find anyone to ever buy it because it has no use to them anymore. Then the value becomes what people will give you for it (maybe $20 or a leaking car battery for that 4k guitar is the best offer you get)
You can still keep it, but the value is unable to be reclaimed.

if someone sells, someone else has to buy them. And if there is enough demand to sell them all then the price won't go down. On the other hand, if there isn't enough demand then no one buys them and then the price goes down. So then you are holding a bunch of btc that are devaluing because you can't sell them

Designer here. It depends on your definition of "hiding". The main problem is QR software has to be able to differentiate the shape of the code points from its surroundings (it's like a 35% contrast change minimum). Because of this, I don't think you could hide it well enough that a person wouldn't notice it but that the camera could see it.
Integration is possible, but it's still noticeable.

Deflation/inflation are not fees or payments. Thats just how it works until all bitcoins are mined. 
Sure, banks aren't charging you this "fee", but the federal reserve is.
Edit: Also whats with the "we pay miners every 10 minutes"? The 25 coin reward isn't coming out of your wallet. those are the coins the miners mined

You just have to understand the risks. If you have coins deposited in someone else's website, they could disappear with your coins. Personally I think they are a strong contender to not disappear, and have been great to work with. However, you never know...
I would recommend that you keep them there until you learn more and get comfortable with securing them yourself. This is something you need to work towards if you want to be confident that you own your money.

If you have reason to believe there was water on the inside of the hard drive, I would NOT try reading the disk. You should send it to a professional data recovery service. They will most likely remove the platters to clean and remount in their own apparatus. This will cost a lot of money, so you are taking a bit of a risk. Not as big a risk, though, as running a hard drive with flood sludge or mineral deposits on its internals. This kills the drive.

*I didn’t realize that people would continue to talk about it over and over and over and it would snowball into something much bigger than we intended it to be.*
It's actually pretty crazy. When they started, they simply said they would be able to provide a $20 floor. 
Soon enough, people had repeated it over and OVER, rehashing and embellishing it. The claim had ballooned to the point that people were expecting them to provide a whopping $20 floor. Ridiculous.

Only in a new/complete rebrand. There are many times in the design world where you will have to redo a single element to mach all the assets a company already has. Or, you could have a mark handled by one group and a site design handled by another, and there is not enough money or cooperation to do both. While these situations may not apply here, a good designer aims for the best solution within given confines.

It depends on the model. They all usually have breather holes, some covered by a special sticker but if it was submerged for any length of time, I don't know enough to say it's waterproof.

This is not a wireframe, you just pushed a partial view of the site into a photoshop template. A hint: If you have actual images (especially of the device it is displayed on), you did not make a wireframe, you made a mockup. A mockup is not useful for a critique of the functionality/layout/UX of a site; mockups are for measuring the oooo ahhh factor. 
**Unless... that IS the whole site: a nav bar, an image slider, and a call-to-action. In which case I guess the only commentary I can give is congrats for putting the nav bar at the top, thats usually where they work best.

Yes. 
A currency that can't update isn't the future of currency. Forking now is less risky than forking in the future, so yes, stretch your legs for the sake of maybe needing to use them later. We could fork back if we really needed to. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:10:14
But it's actually right. 
I have a varying amount of debt charged to a credit card, sometimes it's $800-1200 at the end of the month. This is fine though, because I pay it off. It costs me nothing in interest and I actually make some money in cash rewards.
It would be a problem, however, if I charged $5000 because I can no longer reliably manage that debt each month without incurring higher and higher interest. Someone else who makes a lot more money may be able to pay off 10k per month and avoid interest. Its not the size, its how well you can manage it. 
In the same way, Japan has a lot of money coming in from its economy. They can afford to take out more debt to invest in the country. Additionally, a lot of note holders are actually from japan, so they have a vested interest in loaning the government money (and probably at better terms than foreign debts).

Yeah, it was an easy way to get BTC into my IRA but think I prefer just actually holding bitcoins. 
I didn't see this before getting a few shares:
"Each BIT share represented ownership of 0.1 bitcoins initially. The trust will not generate any income and regularly sells/distributes bitcoins to pay for its ongoing expenses. Therefore, the amount of bitcoin represented by each share gradually declines over time."

That means (if adopted as a "real currency") on average the value of BTC will increase over time relative to goods and services. This is opposed to inflation (like USD) where the value goes down over time.

Because he was trying to walk the line between having the system be responsive to network changes as they happen (shorter periods between adjustments), but also have a long enough time period average to keep people from switching miners on and off, gaming the difficulty level to their advantage.

Thats what would happen if bitcoin was widely accepted and used as a currency. Right now it mirrors the stock market because it is not widely used and speculation is high. In other words, if it is used like a stock it will price like a stock. If it is used like a store of value it will price like a store of value.

It's pretty straightforward. Knotty is played to reference something that is far more complicated on the inside than can be seen from the outside, and then they are literally giving you a list of the event topics. 
This makes sense because it's a design-focused lecture to discuss the complexity and production considerations of the four objects mentioned. Usually these work in an individual case-study style talks, but it would be interesting to see what they have planned. 
When designers design for designers, they can take more liberty with experimental communication. So while this may not be an ideal title for an event for the public, it works to pique the interest of designers. Still functional design as they know what their audience can handle. I would go if I was in Boston.

It's not the average, it's the target. The system is trying to give the miners a puzzle that will be solved in 10 minutes.

You would have to set up contracts with everyone you paid money to. Of course even if it was easily set up, you are giving out money because you want someone's goods or services more than you want the money.

If you are planning to hold for a while, waiting until it's at 230 would only be a difference of about $400 when its all said and done (but you could also take those savings and get almost 2 more coins for that). 
So if you are sitting on 10 $5k+ bitcoins in the future, are you really going to wish you got them $400 cheaper?
Your best bet though is probably a weekly buy if this decision is hard for you.

Bitcoin doesn't need debt, but fiat does. The government NEEDS debt-backed money so it can create more whenever it wants, otherwise they wont have the resources to back the notes with whatever they are backed by.

Nevertheless, the one pattern that has been popping out to me is the low values for 1wk periods. Currently at almost 6 weeks, we have not had a grouping this long of continuously increasing lows since before ATH. It looks like stability to me and if I were a chartist I would call the floor.

Not everyone who likes Bitcoin cares about developing software. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 09:17:22
Because the value of the system is that it's what we want as it is now. Stability. If you start changing rules later the value would drop. The supply and demand will get you every time, and a company isn't going to go to the effort and cost to steal currency that is becoming unwanted and soon worthless.
There are also some more technical explanations and recourses we would have in the case that it does happen, I'm sure someone will chime in soon as I don't know too much on that front. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 00:40:43
She does have a choice now, that's more than I got. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:24:32
I'm going to start by saying I don't know much about this, but what I think will get you is the advance of mining tech. Mining wears hard on rigs, and chips/cards are constantly being improved. This means you should expect a short life cycle of equipment (6months to 1year) 
So, unless you expect it to turn profitable within that time it would make no sense to start now.
Assuming all the above is true, I would put that 10k in bitcoins, and once the price rises to a profitable level, you can buy new and advanced gear then. You will also have the equivalent of 20-30k to start because the price went up.

I think the thing holding it back is the upfront cost. Who risks $500 when they could fail duo lingo for way cheaper? I think you will only have people who are dedicated to getting it for free. 
If it were me, I would make it a $9.99 app, and do some quality monetization with incremental no-skip ads. Then every month have units completed give out a percentage of the ad revenue the user base generated.

This is a very real possibility. Not just forgotten keys, but if you die and dont have a will set up to transfer your wealth you can hit this problem as well. Understand that the coins aren't lost, they just can't move (essentially gone because you can't use them) Once the keys are lost the coins stay in that address forever. The landfill hard drive coins are stuck for now...
One option is that Bitcoin is infinitely divisible, so you could just add more decimal places and trade with fractions of a satoshi
I like to think that in the future people will work on hacking known lost keys. At the time the guy with the landfill hard drive was mining, bitcoins were worth much less and people weren't as security minded. The addresses with a lot of lost coins are probably the easiest to crack. I think it will be a new kind of "mining", or treasure hunting.

I would close my account by using all the money for a large buy at coinbase one last time. You could even send them a letter to tell them they don't have to worry about handling your transactions anymore

I literally discovered this earlier today. I used the api for bit stamp as a cUrl command. It's ugly though

That makes sense. Personally my family has given me a lot of (albeit somewhat good-natured) shit for being involved in Bitcoin. So, there is no way am investing on their behalf to hedge them, who know how much those bits will turn out to be?
This isn't to say they aren't good people, and I do love them. I already know who and how much I would give if I won the lottery, so I will just do its equivalent in btc when it all shakes out.

So how do you know the difference between God and the universe?

Do you have to do this before it goes big? I mean, it is the future of money, so you could just send what people need when they need it.

USAA has never said anything to me about coinbase. I think they were even talking about adding Bitcoin accounts.

My mom was *convinced* there was no reason the Internet would be more than a fad. My family has never let her live it down because she wouldn't be able to go without it now.

Would you really do it if you had the opportunity on the English one? That would be boring as hell, and if it was more money than some third world person makes at his job, then more power to them.

Managing a prison is hardly in the top 50% of terrible things you can do in a video game. 
Also it's a video game. Chill^the^fuck^out

Killed is a verb. An action. 
Street signs aren't killers

ITS BECAUSE NO ONE KNOWS HOW THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY WORKS! THEY CANT MAKE A FUNCTIONING FINANCIAL SYSTEM, HOW DO YOU EXPECT A GAME TOO?!

If you don't pay electric now, mining is the best way to change that.

You could also somehow link the performance of 100% users to an additional  percent of profits from people who didn't complete.
