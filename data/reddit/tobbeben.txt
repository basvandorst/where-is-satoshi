And another slightly crazy theory related to this:
Noticing the significance of 0,1,2 in the puzzle, and that "Try \+1" gives 1,2,3. Or in opposite order 3,2,1. Also notice the word "go" in the neighbourhood.
What if go is the starting point of the block race \(as in 3, 2, 1, go!\)? Notice that the first two words would be "attack" and "early"; maybe if you play it out you will get to "code" and "easily" at the same iteration! Someone should run a TSP solver on this ;\)

I never reflected much on that, but yes there has been some kind of selection process. In that process, for some reason the "z=..." and "q=..." were selected but not the "P=...".
It might be a dead end \(for example they just thought the P values were too long to go into the image\) but it's still highly suspect in my view.

Okay, it's time for me to throw in the towel for today so let me share some insights.
**\-\- Image Manipulation \-\-**
First of all, I went the path of analyzing the image itself for anomalies. And lo and behold, **there are letters that are clearly marked with an orange hue**. Take a look at weaknesses, where **two of the three, but not the third "s" are marked.** And just look at that outstanding 257! :
I gave up this path quite quickly though, since these anomalies are not in plain sight. They could however reveal something about how the image has been edited. I saw this by importing the PNG to Inkscape 0.91 and using the Saturation Map filter.
**\-\- 00212121 \-\-**
I mention this because I think that it has not been mentioned yet: **The fact that 0, 1 and 2 are so close to each other in the puzzle can't be a coincidence, in fact it is one of the most visible clues of them all.**
*So what can that mean?*
Either it is just there to draw attention to the 0.00212121 transfer that occurred in relation to the funding of the price address. In this case it is 00212121 that is the clue. Or, 00212121 is there to draw attention to the area around 0, 1, 2 in the puzzle. Somehow I think that the latter makes more sense since there have been so many clues around that area \(attack, early, code, "Try \+1", infinity, and maybe 00212121 itself\).
If 00212121 is the actual clue, I think it is related to the generation of BIP39 seeds. A BIP39 seed is constructed by a series of eight three\-tuples of words. One digit could represent one three\-tuple. For example it could be the number of words of each tuple that has a certain property.
**\-\- Limited area \-\-**
Speaking of areas in the puzzle, it is noteworthy that **all "clue words" has landed within a quite small total area**. First of all, they are obviously all in the white part of the puzzle. But even within the white part we are mostly confined to an area around 8:30 \- 10 o'clock and 3\-9 o'clock. **I think even the clue "almost open" might refer to the word "open" being "almost" in the area of interest** which would mean that the famous "X" might mark the area boundary, perhaps together with the infinity sign in the northwest.
**\-\- "Missing P:s theory" \-\-**
As mentioned in a previous comment: [
Good luck!

Could there be any technical reason why the P=0.000... numbers from the whitepaper (they come together with the z= numbers) are not in this puzzle? I find it hard to believe that, since we have both numbers containing decimal points (q=035) and number from the second column in the tables (z=24) present. Which means the author has deliberately removed these from the puzzle, maybe as a hint.
These numbers proves/shows the "security model" of Bitcoin, which this puzzle "challenges" (by removing them).
I don't really know what to make of this, but I'm playing with the idea that we are looking at some kind of block race of two chains, and the "pairs" are the blocks from the two chains. The race would then finally be resolved by the 13th block (which would only be one word acting as the passphrase to unlock the wallet, hence the +1). Since the change to the puzzle now probably that extra block has been removed.
EDIT: "reflects on the elements that brought this technology to life" - blocks/blockchain..
EDIT2: also look at the number of clues around the ”block chain” words.. ”code attack early”, ”try +1”, ”00212121” (by the way this clue is probably connected to the fact that those numbers are so close to each other), there is also an arrow (=&gt;) pointing from ”block” to ”chain”...
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:16:09
And exactly this, all the false leads, is what makes the puzzle so hard...
@_date: 2018-05-23 08:05:58
I’m on phone now so can’t search properly, but there were two comments at around the same time: ”+1” and ”Try +1”. If you only find one of them, the other one has been removed..
EDIT: Okay, I remembered wrong.. the single ”+1” suddenly became more interesting though 
@_date: 2018-05-25 05:04:39
”Almost open” could mean that ”open” is ”almost” something. I like to believe that open is almost within the relevant area, but not quite.
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:38:36
Maybe the ”almost” in that clue has the same meaning as in ”almost open”, maybe not..
What I find fascinating is that OP finished that clue with a period (as in ”Lost transaction costs almost users.”) which makes it sound like a finished sentence rather than a collection of words... I don’t think anyone has commented on that yet
@_date: 2018-05-23 07:42:48
You might be correct.. however if I remember correctly the first ”+1” was a direct answer to a question whether we are looking for a BIP39 seed. Which strongly indicates that we look for a seed + passphrase.
It might have dual meanings as well of course.
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:36:42
Hmm "12" and "circle" do sound familiar.. But I think it's not related to that ;\)
This is interesting though:
    double p = 1.0 - q;
    double lambda = z * (q / p)
You can make lambda go to infinity and beyond \(well, sort of\) by letting q grow beyond 1.0.
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:38:03
That's a very good question, and I guess OP won't tell you the answer to that.
Technically, the additional clues shouldn't be **required** to solve the puzzle, so if you feel unsure you might as well ignore that clue.
