You could pretty easily create separate private subnets for each of your clients. Then let your clients connect to their subnets via a VPN (OpenVPN will do fine).
There is nothing fancy about it, a Linux box as a router can do it easily, but indeed it's not a job for 15 minutes. But you might consider it!

Not true. It's the pool that decides how how the hashrate is being used. Miners blindly mine at a pool and accept any Stratum job. It's the pool that decides which transactions are included in the next block, if block should be withhold or published etc.

I wish there was a vending machine with cool drinks that accepts bitcoin only. With no other vending machines nor shops within 30 min walk. People would kill to get some bitcoin to buy a drink :-)

ROTFL. If providing network access to our miners implies "Network Security concerns", I suggest you should re-think your plan. Or your staff.

I am eagerly waiting for 10.00 bits = 1 dollar. This would make prices in bits the same order of magnitude as prices in most other fiat currencies. People really like simple multipliers when converting prices.
So... you could also introduce 1kbit. This way 1.5625 kbit = 1 USD = 1 cup of coffee.

Google Authenticator has one major disadvantage: it's not possible to back up your seeds (private keys). You need to:
1. copy QR-codes (seeds) when initializing 2FA each time you add a new account,
2. back up the entire phone
Recently I have switched to Authy. Things I like are:
1. backups are locally encrypted and stored at Authy servers
2. multi-device is as easy as adding another tablet/phone and entering the secret password.
Authy secures against loss of phone, that's good. I still think though that the whole process is a bit fuzzy. But it's worth considering.

Actually I have a few in mind. One of my ideas is to move Wikidot.com (an online wiki farm, pretty large, it's my project too) in the Bitcoin/privacy direction. We already accept Bitcoin for upgrades, but it's not really enough to call it a Bitcoin startup, right?
I have a few other ideas in mind, one related to mining and it's almost completed already.
The other project should help merchants in Poland accept Bitcoin payments at POS.

Charge a fee when your hashrate exceeds 30%. It's the simplest solution, should work instantly. The closer to 50% the larger the fee. What's wrong with it?
@_date: 2014-06-17 07:57:33
Well, one thing for sure -- for Bitcoin to be popular a few things need to be done:
- more people need to **want to have** bitcoins
- more people need to feel **comfortable holding/spending** bitcoins
- more merchants need to **accept** bitcoins
- more people need to be **paid in** bitcoins
Apart from the project that is nearly finished (needs some investment too), I have not yet decided for 100% where to go next. It's a matter of the next few months I guess.
But one thing for sure - the Bitcoin economy worked really good in my case and if I am to start something new, it has to be Bitcoin-related. Now, if I could sell my flat for bitcoins, no doubt it would be simply awesome :-)

Does it mean I will be able to pay with bitcoin for VMWare now? Wow.

Assume BIP70 (and Bitcoin payments) gets popular in shops. With millions of transactions daily there will be people willing to cheat. A few might succeed in double-spending.

The problem is that end-users fail providing decent upload speeds. While AWS (S3, EC2) is connected via multiple, multi-Gbps connections, many home users are limited to 1Mbps. I see it as a real problem.

Storing private keys on anything connected to the Internet is risky.
Anyway, it does not seem like an "open" platform, so the usage would be limited to what designers and developers implemented in the machine.

If **distributed** and **decentralized** is something that gives Bitcoin value (and it is), you should be concerned.

Now, there is BTC, mBTC, uBTC, bits - tell it to my mom who wants to get into bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:13:21
Even if a pool is considered "honest", gaining &gt; 50% hash ratio undermines the very essence of Bitcoin - decentralization.
@_date: 2014-06-16 08:13:39
Congratulations on the idea. I hope this catches, I am a great believer in micropayments as an alternative to advertising for converting traffic to revenue.

Creating blocks in blockchain relies on consensus via a process known as mining. As in democracy, if any fraction achieves more than 50% of power it can override the "consensus" part of the process.
The distribution of hashrate is a guarantee that even IF any pool starts doing things to abuse the Bitcoin mining process it cannot harm it.
But consider this: if Ghash.io has a bug in its block/transaction processing (block withholding, not accepting or duplicating certain transactions), it could affect the whole blockchain. They would have the majority of hashrate and would control the blockchain creating process.
Even if declaring "not evil", too much power in too few very rarely ended well.
@_date: 2014-06-11 07:32:29
I really hope this will help Bitcoin get more reliable payments.
Without BIP70 imagine a supermarket. With 10 people in a row paying with BTC, there is a high chance that:
1. a person's phone has problems connecting to the internet =&gt; longer processing or cannot pay at all
2. payment is made, but it takes time to propagate =&gt; longer processing time
With fiat payment model we are used to make payments within seconds. I hope BIP70 will bring the same smoothness to BTC payments and enable large-scale deploys.
Imagine this however: even with BIP70, should the merchant acknowledge payment without confirming it in a block? It sounds like the only way to make payments smoothly, otherwise you will need to wait on average &gt;5 minutes, which is defeating the whole purpose.

Consider "cold storage". Create a new address, print it on paper (with private key), put somewhere safe, remove from your computer.
You can even print a nice paper wallet.
Search Google on this.

Wow, you can even send it to Poland. That's great.

Thanks for all the comments! The first bitcoin transactions are going through!
I think the service still needs some time to grow, but it is on a solid path now.

Hmmm. Now there will be a new topic: how investors can be sure their bitcoins are safe?
@_date: 2013-09-19 19:04:18
Paypal vision could not be fulfilled by a centralized system. Every centralized system is prone to corruption, governmental control and abuse. Rather than having weaknesses, it is a weakness itself and a single point of failure.
Bitcoin on the other hand… You know the rest :-)

Take a look at [BitPay]( They have a range of plugins and modules for popular online store software.
If you want something super-custom with moderate amount of work, [Blockchain.info]( has a nice API too.

This line scares me off. It makes me unsure about the real prices.
Anyway, you need to work on your approach. Either you want to:
1. Appeal to the Bitcoin users -
 
 In this case the whole bitcoin explanation is a waste of space, better use it to feature **your services**.
2. Appeal to Bitcoin newbies -
 
 Lack of USD pricing is a minus. Also you should rather feature your products rather than the currency in the first place.
Either way I think the services are more important than Bitcoin explanations.
I think the best strategy might be featuring as a perfect match: great hosting plans, now with Bitcoin payments.
For currency conversions, we use 
Hope this gives a useful perspective. It's just my opinion, I am fighting similar problems with my own project, which is yet to announce BTC support.

You either had JavaScript disabled or .js did not load for some reason. I will work on an appropriate message. I will look into this. Some extensions (like AdBlock) might be blocking certain javascript files.

I have implemented Bitcoin payments at Streamza.com about a month ago. It sits next to Paypal. Now we have about 10% sales in Bitcoins.
Is it much? No. Was it worth it? Financially not yet. But I am glad we joined the Bitcoin movement and I am sure it will pay off. Even now it is promoting our service and driving people to it.
@_date: 2013-09-19 07:19:06
Right, but it makes the merchant vulnerable to double-spend attacks. And it's not that easy to avoid them with 0-confirmations.
Besides, even 0-confirmation sometimes takes longer. Imagine a line in a market with all those angry people waiting only because someone decided to pay with bitcoins :-)

Do not ask me - my account was not affected. But indeed, some people blame a bot they downloaded, some blame a link to a page containing a Java exploit (?), some claim their account was hacked just by brute force password attack.

API is working now, but still seems unstable. 
I was about to launch Bitcoin payments for my project and this came as a surprise. Also makes me think about reliability of 3rd party APIs, especially when customers' money is involved.

Yeah, this is what my friends are saying. They've been waiting for Bitcoin to drop for a month now because it was always "too expensive" and "will drop any second now". I did not wait and bought 10 BTC when it was still ~100 USD.
Take this into account.
