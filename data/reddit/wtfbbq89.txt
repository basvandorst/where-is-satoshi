Im not pro-tether myself, but printing it for 8 days is entirely different from “every day”. They need more supply now because demand is insane. There would not be enough tether if they did not create more (and back it up with usd as well, as visible in their report). As long as the market accepts it to be worth about 1 usd, it works. Same for “real” dollars.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:24:00
Ah I see. I hope for you that the monthly renewing was two days ago then ;)
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:10:52
So how do you read reddit without seeing any price info? Teach me this art.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:00:31
Most coin algos are quantum resistant
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:03:28
Tell them you are a grown up, they will have to learn that anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:29:01
Ahh thx. Every day learning something new, even non crypto related :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:44:31
Is it not +3 for every doubling?
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:30:49
If it belongs to them, they theoretically can fix it. Be prepared for support ticket wait times of 10+ days
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:59:41
Or much much much less if you live in another country like the Netherlands.
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:07:03
Move to the Netherlands, here they do not. Actually today I had a genuinly nice conversation with a bank employee about crypto, definetely not against it.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:14:14
Actually even more forks
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:14:11
Open account on other bank, withdraw small amounts and move to “main bank”. Answer questions from bank with the evidence you have and tell them that they are asking something seriously problematic. Insinuate you have bulkloads of cash that you are planning to permanently move elsewhere and the red carpet will be rolled out in no time. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:37:19
When this issue gets real, it will be changed
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:09:43
Tether is always backed by exactly one dollar, so value is always about 1 usd and a good safe haven for temporary money storage. With fiat money you are having a far worse bet than USDT, since more gets printed without any backing.
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:34:21
Yeah true that is a bit overdone..
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:15:07
Where did you get that 100 mil a day from? Simply not true. And even if it is true, they have a daily report on their reserves showing the coin actually is backed by 1 usd.
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:55:31
Read the title again, lol. I did love reading your rage.
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:52:55
This. If you can explain where you got it all from, it was not hard for me to get tier 4 verified (but I own much less). Make sure that your bank does not give you trouble as well, I would not withdraw all at once.
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:01:44
This, and people need to learn to keep their coins safe without exchanges etc
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:52:48
Nope, high. They want others to require high fees to get their transaction done and then complain about that and switch to bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:19:20
ALWAYS store the 2FA backup key somewhere safe. This way you can recover it back to the google authenticator app.
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:05:19
Please read what a ponzi is. Then think again.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:36:02
They did not, no way to place new orders so not a single trade made since maintenance started. But a rollback just brings back the old non working system, lets hope they really fix it and we can all trade happily again.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:46:01
Probably they suspect money laundering by moving deposits over to other exchanges. Obviously reaching them will take forever and may not help at all. Never use them again.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:28:00
Like I said, im not pro tether and share your concerns, except that I believe you overstate them a bit. since it is actually valued at about 1 dollar by the market I very rarely do use it to move to fake-fiat for a short time when I see or expect downfalls on exchanges that have no fiat pairs. I would never ever have much money in tether for a long time and would not advise anyone to do so, but I also believe it is not ment for that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:11:13
Because it's a great opportunity to get in at a discounted price. Why would anyone get in at all if they know what the price was this year January? If you already decided to jump in, this is a great deal.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:16:10
Yes but that is a different problem :) it will be hard to cash out that level because people will have to afford it. But this can also be 1000 people that buy 0.001 of your coin each.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:33:25
You had btc back then? Then thats why
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:43:43
Haha ok then it is not. We will see who is right.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:56:11
Well, I am experiencing the same problems as well. It is already a complete pain in the ass to even get to the point where you can complete the withdraw process without running into errors...
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:47:54
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:18:41
It's always hard to say when the bottom of a dip is reached, or if it will quickly bounce back. I have made some mistakes with that in the past, either selling when I shouldn't have or buying when I shouldn't have. For me doing nothing usually works best.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:11:33
For me it has been 24 hrs now so I can wait a bit if I know it will all be fine then. But in an e-mail that I received after initiating the withdraw it states that when a withdraw to an address is done for the first time, an email would be sent to confirm that. I did not receive such an email, does this also apply for SEPA EUR withdraws, and can this hold back my withdraw? For now the status hangs at "Sending". 
UPDATE: It was processed successfully. In total in about 24 hours, I think that's actually pretty good :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:55:38
Same problem here
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:09:29
Don't wish me luck, like you I already got in at a price where this "drop" means nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:43:42
Are this SEPA Euro transfers?
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:24:43
Support is extremely busy. Got a mail after 19 days here with nothing but a statement that they are training new people. I totally understand your worries but Bittrex is legit and will resolve your matter, unfortunately only after a completely unacceptable timeframe probably...
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:26:56
People panic-sell a lot here, that means excellent chances to get aboard at a huge discount and see the prices restore to previous levels in hours/days.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:13:31
Yes, because if you sell your coin for 1 mil someone still needs to pay you that million with money on the exchange. The exchange is not the party that pays you the coin in fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:47:03
Unless its a crypto knife
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:10:21
Will not be a problem since people need the fiat on the exchange to buy your coin. So the liquidity will be there unless they screw up big time.
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:32:19
Kylie's thirst indeed really did SHOCK me!
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:19:37
I know, I just mention that the taxes are incredibly low. Making profits from crypto is much more interesting than making profit from working tax wise, thats simply my point.
In not saying that the American system is bad or anything like that, its just different and I prefer the Dutch system for investment profits.
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:00:21
But not too much because then he will quit at 10M$
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:59:30
I did not mean it that literally. What I did mean is that no one can predict the future, so there NEVER is certainty of Bitcoin success or more broadly certain success of anything at all.
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:01:42
I would convert part of it to fiat and invest in something else. Maybe buy an additional house and rent it out or something like that. It will give recurring income and depends less on market crashes, it will then still be a house
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:54:24
Buckle up, BTC buying opportunities are coming up!
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:13:36
Because they either instantly sold the BCH or because they are unhappy with the entire history and discussion that evetually caused this split
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:00:42
Uhhm no. No matter how many investment gains I make, I dont pay taxes for it. This makes making profite a lot more interesting here. And for people owning a business there are also lots of tax cuts that lower the tax pressure by quite a few %. And besides that, here in the Netherlands we have much more paid days off than most Americans.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:29:16
I agree, hodling is good but sometimes its also fine to sell. I have converted some BTC to another currency I believe in, probably to convert back to BTC again at a later time, hoping that the other currency will rise faster the upcoming period.
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:38:27
If you don't understand my reply and the impact this really has, it does not mean that I did not understand your question. I guess we both just have a different vision on what might be called revolutionary.
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:57:19
The US really is not the richest country in the world.
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:40:23
The Genesis block was in 2009?
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:45:11
I see how thats a difficult thing, thats not really "not wanting them back". But I totally understand how it can be great fun to rip off some scammers, honestly I think I would scam them as well and maybe donate the coins to some charity, at least not use them for myself. And only after asking ID verification that they will not provide!
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:05:38
It will be exactly like owning 2 completely different coins. So you can choose what to sell or keep.
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:07:38
Get verified or buy for 250 a day for a while
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:43:25
Interesting thing, I hope it will continue to go on like this ;)
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:47:09
Maybe also try to diversify the investments a bit, don't bet all your money on one horse and lose it all if Bitcoin would crash hard (I don't think so but no one can be sure). I invest money in crypto but also in the "slow" but more stable stock markets and some regular savings. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:31:30
The one thing leads automatically to the other, imo, but as I see it that are the two reasons that make the rule so true. And obviously it compensatea for swings in value that you may have to sit out, if in such a low period you would need the money, you would make a big unneccessay loss..
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:09:27
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:01:41
And you do think its right to keep it? Thats scamming as well to me.
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:14:37
This! I love living in the Netherlands, no capital gain taxes here
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:26:40
Most likely yes, but if there are only loads of buying orders that are (much) smaller than the lowest selling orders, nothing will happen. With high volume markets the price is very likely to go up when buyers outweigh sellers
@_date: 2017-08-16 07:56:44
It is possible and everything can go wrong. No one knows what will happen.
@_date: 2017-08-06 11:43:49
That is the basic logic, isnt it?
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:32:38
And then it will go up again and all hodlers will be buying 500 additional bitcoins. Or any other random prediction that is based on feelings.
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:24:35
Yes, that is correct
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:04:55
It will not grow to be that, it already is for a long time
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:53:20
Its not revolutionary in 10 years, but now. The same goes for your examples, 10 years after the first email no one considers this a revolution anymore as well. And they are also just practical, not visionary. You are focusing it on the practical things, I am focusing on Sathosi's vision of an entire new way to think about currencies and payments.
In 10 years people will realise how much has changed with a decentralized currency in the same way that email once was an awesome new thing. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:58:01
2 for 5000BTC each
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:16:25
This tax is not based on actual gains and assumes a certain profit made from money you have. The tax on this is very low, when making huge gains you dont pay taxes for having made those gains.
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:30:55
If bitcoin could entirely replace credit cards and be used everywhere for "silly" transactions without the need for banks, I would definetely say yes that's revolutionary.
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:07:50
I strongly believe that Bitcoin will succeed and eventually increase even more in value. But the way it goes it is also very likely that there will also be potentially big price drops. I personally see that as buying chances more than scare reasons to sell everything off.
If I really had to bet my money on it I would say that the price you indicate of 5-7k will once be there, but I don't know if it will be by the end of this year.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:21:15
I guess that pretty soon you will be happy with the transition you made. The world of BTC is an awesome ride for more than just the money
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:35:55
Any investment that makes x3 return would still be considered an amazing investment opportunity, also or maybe even especially when you are not filthy rich.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:07:23
Still a good decision, think long term
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:29:24
Never stress, not worth it. Just hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:16:22
And never ever leave your coins on exchanges again! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:27:55
As long as you keep the golden rule to not invest what you cannot afford to lose, your life will not get ruined even if it drops down to $1. Sleep well ;)
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:11:06
That is how it’s done! The trend is up but it is nearly impossible to know when small corrections happen. The alternative is waiting for a correction that does not happen and think what if I... that hurts much more ;)
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:23:27
I didnt back then :’)
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:12:11
I hope he talked about 10k€, he may have a chance to keep both
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:24:44
Never trust “them”, trust your own research in the subject and follow your gut feeling. “Them” is mostly risk averse or not open minded and will follow much later.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:22:09
So far my experience is that most exchanges are actually not really fast in replying...
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:14:19
Besides that it takes until 2140, from them on there will simply be no more block rewards. Miners will have to live on transaction fees. Lets say they have lots of time to adapt to that ;)
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:19:19
Ah f.. I feel sorry for you man! Hope it works out for you but your odds are low
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:58:21
It's funny to see what people come up with for free BTC. I guess all billionaires will instantly send 100BTC just to show the world they can.
@_date: 2017-09-10 00:33:28
Anything that promises these kind of returns is a scam, no need for any checking out, just use your common sense, like you did yourself. If they could make those profits, they really would not need to share that tech with anyone and would keep it all for themselves. If it looks too good to be true...
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:45:35
4000 will be laughable cheap one day, just make sure to buy more today
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:13:09
They will wake up and see the huge bargain btc is now, they will love it that over night it got discounted big and buy right away and love their government for it. Or it will crash hard, who knows!
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:22:09
That would mean even cheaper btc tomorrow, I will be ready for this
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:45:35
4000 will be laughable cheap one day, just make sure to buy more today
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:40:53
Because now is the 2nd best option after years ago
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:54:03
Cloud mining, so probably scam
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:57:07
Yes, they have arguments. Often they can be countered fairly easy because people dont know what they are talking about. That is an opportunity to teach people about the awesome world of BTC. And sometimes having a discussion with someone who thinks different can be more refreshing than tunnel vision with people that already think the same as I do.
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:50:34
Nothing, it was fake
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:13:09
They will wake up and see the huge bargain btc is now, they will love it that over night it got discounted big and buy right away and love their government for it. Or it will crash hard, who knows!
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:05:28
It is not, the people that complain and cry are also not a big deal but part of the childish sentiment around all crypto currencies. So be prepared for more rollercoaster up or down  posts. We just have to live with it. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:37:48
Just dont believe him, look at the BTC price charts and you will find him to be wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:36:09
People buy
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:50:14
Or use websockets with nodejs, probably more efficient but still not worth it 
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:22:04
Yes, but that is not specific to crypto ;)
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:10:26
By doing research in what BTC really is and how it works. Read a lot and then more. Any questions more specific can be answered here.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:22:09
That would mean even cheaper btc tomorrow, I will be ready for this
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:54:40
Years ago would have been great, you likely would have had a real 700k now!
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:12:50
And I always try to also read news about people who are against BTC, it helps to understand their arguments and see where they may have valid points.
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:46:53
For the BTC price movement the answer is simple; supply and demand.
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:09:27
Key difference is that we dont pay tax over gains, it does not matter if BTC goes up by 1 or 1000%, taxes are the same, it also does not matter if you make transaction or not. The 1.2% is no longer correct as of 2017, but the same concept still stands with some minor changes. All you need to know is the amount of assets you own by January 1st. The “free money” is correct but will also be very hard to prove by the tax agency.
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:03:04
Ok, but will your BTC be SODL  first?
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:22:48
That is called investing, getting BTC without having to pay at all and worry about FUD. Much higher ROI than I will ever get
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:49:05
This highly depends on where you are from. Here in the Netherlands we don’t have such a tax for example.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:58:04
They did not say it is not going to crash, maybe after it hits the $3600
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:41:56
I call that solution Spotify
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:39:59
No one knows for sure, and jf someone was sure for some reason he or she probably would not tell. There is upward potential but it may also crash hard. Don't invest money you cannot afford to lose!
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:25:36
About 30%, most of it bitcoin
