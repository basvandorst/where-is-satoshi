 But that's because it's scarce and lasts. You can say the same for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:33:41
The more you learn about how bitcoin works, the more you start to have faith in the underlying maths cryptography and principles. We're in early days so of course the price is volatile but ultimately, in some ways, bitcoin is more robust than any physical item and therefore once adopted and fine tuned I personally believe, as do many others in this sub, that it will ultimately prove to be pretty revolutionary and useful. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:17:08
There are plenty of other materials that are valuable for their physical traits like gold but none of them hold value in the same way as gold does. That's because gold is scarce and a popular store of wealth. You can say the exact same things about bitcoin. They are scarce, and we can mathematically guarantee that, and they are also becoming a popular store of wealth. 
Your argument only stands to prove that gold is multi-functional, not that it's value is reliant on the fact that it has other functions outside of storing wealth.

Nothing wrong with healthy skeptisism. Time will tell how reliable it is. I'm of the opinion it will last and I certainly hope it does. I'm young and a CS undergrad though so I'm probably pretty biased compared to the average Joe.

I only have two bank accounts and they're both attached to paypal although one only has maybe £150 in so don't care too much about that one. The other is my main account and certainly has more than enough to cover the dispute.
You're right I was unable to remove my accounts due to having a negative balance.
@_date: 2015-06-27 18:29:23
True but I also think they just want to avoid hassle. They'll probably just side with whoever makes the process simpler for them. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:32:45
Yeah I know :/ 
I thought maybe the fact that the chargeback wasn't done through paypal but in fact the bank, maybe they'll be more keen to prevent it happening?
Also, what's to stop me removing my bank details from paypal? There is no money on my paypal account, it's been sat in my bank for a month. Why not just remove the accounts or even empty my bank account? 
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:56:38
No I know, I'm just hoping paypal don't want it to escalate either and so they may decide to side with me. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 12:44:46
Nah I'm thinking that say this persons card details were stolen (hence the chargeback was initiated from the bank not PP themselves) that maybe PayPal will say look, whilst you may not have initiated the transaction, having your card details stolen was nothing to do with us or this third party (me) and the bank should claim it on insurance or whatever.
@_date: 2015-06-28 12:43:07
Let me hope okay xD
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:15:24
I knew this very much, I even used to cautiously trade for PayPal to the right people in small amounts knowing the risk for a high rate for profit. I've been through chargebacks before but never anything substantial and I usually won out on them anyway. 
That was a while back though and I had just a small bit of hope hat maybe, just maybe paypal weren't going to be dicks anymore?

I got out quickly when I saw the payouts drop and a push towards anything other than earning BTC. In the end I made about $15 worth from mining and lost like $10 when I sold my prime on so technically i guess I made a very unsubstantial ROI. 
Get out now, as soon as possible, I felt extremely uncomfortable the whole time I was relying on them and have much better peace of mind now that I'm out.
Your deeper in than I and it is probably much harder for you making the decision when for me only $50 was on the line. I still urge you to get out ASAP.

Massive fan of the website man, found it so useful to get set up with custom multisig wallets in a really simple way.
My only gripe with the way things work currently, that I attempted to come up with a solution to and submitted on GitHub but my solution probably wasn't the best, is the AES encryption.
When generating the private key, you're given the option to encrypt it with a passphrase. However, no where on the website is there a way to decrypt your key again.
My solution was to add an optional passphrase field when signing transactions. I actually planned to hide it and detect automatically when an encrypted key was entered, then showing it to prompt for a passphrase, but the solution I submitted to GitHub was not that polished.
Could you potentially work on a better system for encrypting and decrypting private keys? Regardless of the encryption standard or whatever that is used, a seamless way to go back and fourth would be a huge improvement!

Care to explain how you came to that conclusion based on his last comment?

I totally agree with a lot of things you are saying. It is really immoral to rip off another persons work like this. However, the license you attached to the device and its firmware means you specifically permitted this to happen. There are licenses and ways to make your product open source for security and transparency without giving other people the rights to profit from your work. I feel like maybe a better decision could have been made about the license you released your work under to prevent this kind of dishonest competition. 
Maybe for future firmware/hardware updates a different license could be used? Wouldn't have any effect on the fact that BWallet currently have a licensed rip off but it would mean that any security advancements you now make from further R&amp;amp;D would be better protected. 
Edit: Just wanted to add I'm a fan of your work and thank you for your service to the community.

It shouldn't make a difference what Satoshi did or does think. I know he expressed that the block limit was temporary and frankly I agree with that idea. But despite that, it doesn't matter. Bitcoin is now something that represents the people and anyone is able to propose changes and improvements. Whether or not these changes are made is up to everyone. Not Satoshi, not any single dev, it's up to everyone.

It's always risky. Go for the best reputation seller you can find. Also check the risk factors such as has that person verified their name, phone number etc. 
Even when you think you've found someone trustworthy it doesn't always work out. By far the best thing to do is steer well clear of PayPal. I learned this lesson the hard way when I lost around £600 to a chargeback. Months after the trade the guy reversed the transaction via his bank and no matter how hard I tried PayPal refused to get involved meaning it was basically the scammers banks decision. Obviously I lost the dispute...
Since then I've never traded by anything other than a direct national bank transfer and I've never traded more than a couple hundred pounds at a time. If I have a fair bit to sell off at once I use different buyers to spread the risk.
@_date: 2015-01-10 12:53:55
Bitcoin is not used solely for money laundering. It can be used for anything you want just like the dollars in your pocket. And how on earth did you figure that someone was like a "shady guy in a trench coat"? This is about the most open and transparent transaction one can make. It's like walking into the town square and shouting from a megaphone "I am giving Jimmy fallon $288 at precisely 3pm and everyone can see a written record of it at request."

By releasing it as open source in the way he did, he gave up any right to have any leadership in its future. I think that was his goal, to make it public property, free from centralisation, which is surely more important to him and the rest of us than the block size.

That's what they said after Mt. Gox shut down, and after silk road shut down, and after every price dip. There'll always be a time in the past when everyone "should have" sold but theres also tomorrow, and I dont know what the price will do tomorrow but I know bitcoin will get a little bit better.
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:28:45
You can pick random points and say "well if you bought then you'd make a loss" with literally anything. That is insane logic. Of course there are lots of people who made losses, but there's also lots of people like myelf who didn't buy at the top and made good money. I don't know why you're so determined to shit on bitcoin in these comments but at least try to make some good arguments about the technology instead of extrapolating far fetched conclusions based on selective data.
At the end of the day, there's $6.4B of value in bitcoin that didn't exist a few years ago. I'd say that's a pretty big success so far.
@_date: 2016-06-04 21:21:47
Ok I badly worded what I was trying to convey. When I said that's not how supply and demand works, what I meant was that demand won't stay a constant. Nor will supply exactly half. There's a lot more factors at play.

They're still in control of their miners hashing power though. Could cause havoc with a large enough pool and a malicious owner.
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:20:20
We're talking about 2 different things. You're talking about an individual malicious miner that is a member of a pool, I'm talking about a person that runs the pool turning malicious. They could indeed perform a 51% attack if their pools total hash power was that high and that has been a genuine concern in the past.

The halving doesn't double the difficulty, it reduces the block reward. Nor does this mean the price will "be at least 2X higher" - in fact it's very unlikely to double in price. That's just not how supply and demand work. I'm no expert, just it's common sense that it isn't that simple.
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:23:21
You sound like you have assumed he invested more than he could afford to lose. Being "pretty frustrated" by the price doesn't mean that. Nor is bitcoin a "wanna-be currency invented by unknown people". It's very clever software that can work as a store of wealth that is maintained and constantly being worked on by some of the smartest minds in cryptography, computer science, and economics.
It is not "pure luck" to expect to make a return on the investment either. I, for one, belive the technology is solid and as it continues to develop it will gain broader adoption, driving up demand and the price. I have the degree to back up those beliefs. I might be wrong but an educated decision based upon years of experience does not equate to "pure luck" in my books. I can't tell the future, but I can make informed predictions.

Likewise, I saw a big buy wall at 0.16 and just went with it. But minutes later it had dropped down to 0.12 and then recovered slightly after the mad rush when that block was mined.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:08:49
You can try a "double spend" of sorts. Try to send the original coins again but with a higher fee and hope that the miner takes the higher fee and sends the coins to the new address (one that you control) as opposed to the original one.

I wholeheartedly support bitcoin but these kind of posts just come across as niave to me. The stock market is vastly larger than bitcoin and 3% of something so large is not such a small deal. As much as we want bitcoin to succeed, it is still in it's infancy and I think it's important to remember that before jumping on the bandwagon and throwing caution to the wind.

Makes more sense to think of it as a correction not a dip. It inflated in price a huge percentage over a very short time so that was never going to be sustainable. The result is that it crashes back down and settles an a more stable value.

This sounds fantastic and really useful in every day life, especially when it comes to travelling. If there is the possibility to potentially use NFC stickers etc (as you suggested in other comments) then why must the clients device be connected to the Internet? (As stated in other comments). Surely if using a sticker is possible then there is no need for the client to be online? I'm guessing you could use the terminals connection to make all the relevant API calls and decline the transaction there if any issues occur. Am I missing something?

Some good points. Originally when I read about the debate a block size increase seemed the obvious solution to me. You've made me realise there might be more to it. Long term it doesn't make a huge amount of sense and it only postpones having to actually deal with bitcoins scalability.

One my dad pointed out is it could be a cyber security firm with great anti-ransom ware looking to make a profit off increased sales as a result.

Bitcoin Cash will be a hard fork of the main Bitcoin blockchain. Therefore anyone who currently owns bitcoins (as in has their private keys) will simultaneously have both BTC and BCC on the 2 separate chains.
Therefore us bitcoin owners can download the BCC client, import our bitcoin private keys and dump our BCC onto the market for some free money without effecting our actual bitcoins on the main chain.
@_date: 2015-03-29 00:08:55
That's what transaction fees are for. Miners will earn vastly less than they do now (no more block rewards) but they will still earn the minute amounts from transaction fees. Baring in mind this is a long way in the future it's likely that mining hardware will be far more cheaper/efficient and bitcoin's value will be greater. 
Transaction fees can always be increased with updated source code and such too.
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:49:59
Personally I think it's very unlikely that the BCC client will be stealing your private keys in order to grab your bitcoins, but if it makes you feel safer then sure there's no reason you couldn't move your BTC after the fork and then import your old keys to BCC.
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:15:34
It's normally relatively easy to cash out Bitcoin but when you piss off this many people all over the world, I'm sure there'd be enough resources devoted to tracking the trail. Governments are losing their shit over this, there's no way you could just slap it through a mixer and get away with it. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 18:52:03
Based on how little they've made in ransom and how easy it would be to get caught trying to cash out that Bitcoin, it seems like the only logical reason for carrying out an attack like this.

Bitcoin at its core is based on [asymmetrical cryptography]( which means that each bitcoin address has two keys behind it. One is public and allows people to send you bitcoins and verify who you are, the other is private that allows you to "sign" transactions to prove you own the coins. A bitcoin address is a hash of the public key, this just makes it a bit smaller and easier to handle.
Some newer wallets generate bitcoin addresses deterministically. This is where each new address it generates is based off the last one. That way, you only need to tell the wallet 1 piece of information and then it can restore all of your past, current and future bitcoin addresses simply by iterating through. Most wallets that work in this way use a seed or mnemonic like you said that consists of a few random words making it easier to remember or write down than a private key. This is fed into a big complicated random number generator to determine your bitcoin addresses and keys.
So, seeds are implemented inside of some bitcoin wallets but aren't necessarily universal. Your seed in one bitcoin wallet might not generate the same addresses in a different one. Private keys however, are a core part of how bitcoin works and all wallets understand them. Assuming the BCC client is pretty much a clone of bitcoin core, then it will very easily accept any private keys you have and work just fine.
It's also possible some of the bitcoin wallet software that uses seeds will be forked to work with BCC. If this is the case then I would assume a seed from that client that worked for bitcoin, would also generate the same addresses for BCC, however I'm not a 100% certain on that one. Due to some fundemental changes in the way bitcoin works that are being made in BCC, it may be possible that the seeds will churn out different addresses, but I'm just speculating based on fairly limited understanding.

So in other words they want to take Bitcoin and make it centralised and controlled by a single entity. Yeah... no.

This sums up my opinion nicely. I'm no expert and have no idea how best to scale bitcoin. I just want something that causes as little controversy and volatility as possible.

Is it bad that I read the meme in a Russian voice in my head?

I tried to set up a business account with them but in the interest of transparency I stated up front that my business dealt with Bitcoin. They totally refused to permit any transactions regarding Bitcoin.

There could potentially be some kind of add on system, the ability to download a small extra package to add support for a new coin. That way you only need to install what you use but it's still all in one place.

I'm not very familiar with ethereum but I was imaging a "store" like with chrome extensions or something.

That might be the case but I certainly wouldn't rely on that probability alone. There certainly are viruses aimed at linux out there and considering much of bitcoins user base is tech savvy there's more reason to target linux for a hacker looking to steal bitcoins.

I'm no expert but I imagine the security features of hardware wallets are a key selling point and many of them would be compromised by running something similar on a pi.
Obviously having your wallet offline is still more secure but trezors also have tamper protection and very well scrutinized open source firmware built to purpose as opposed to a vast general purpose operating system. Using a pi would probably greatly increase your attack surface over a traditional hardware wallet.
Could still be better than a software wallet if done well though I reckon.
