India I suspect will eventually be fine with bitcoins.
By that time, most of the world will be trading and have bitcoins.
Indians as a proportion will just end up with less. By the time bitcoin is legal in India the price will be very high. India will be poorer in bitcoins compared to other countries.

It is weird reading about this, as a Bitcoin ATM opened up a few months ago in my building in London. I can just go downstairs and transact. And then realising that the whole of India only has one bitcoin ATM.

Man if 70 SAT can buy a nice lunch, 1 BTC will be worth a mega amount.

Hey, UK redditor here. First bitcoin ATM I saw was a couple of months ago when one opened in the bottom of our building :)

Wow....how is Bloomberg so off the mark on crypto? This is like the 3rd thing I've seen where they are way off.

Thanks for the speedy response. Guess I won't be sitting by a beach anytime soon :) if I had any btc in my reddit tip account,  I'd send you some,  but have an upvote.
