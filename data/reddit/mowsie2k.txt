So I'm an 8 year old girl who makes good investing decisions and doesn't cry for sympathy calling myself a loser and failure hoping for upvotes. What does that make you? LMAO if I'm 8 how did I pay 11k in taxes alone from my gains last year... stupid asshole xD
For all the self hate you have, all the times you've called yourself a loser and a failure, you don't find it pathetic that a "little baby girl" you believe to be "8 years old" made dozens of thousand of dollars while you sat on your ass crying to reddit? Hahaha
Goddamn you are a pathetic piece of shit xD

I'm a 26 year old woman, who has enjoyed Nintendo products her whole life, and you just keep embarrassing yourself even more lol. You are so unbelievably pathetic. So now the veil is down and we can see that you just make fun of yourself over and over in a bid for attention. Now that someone calls you out, and they even made money while you felt sorry for yourself, you will rampage. Your anger and tears delight me in every way :D
More pathetic tears undoubtedly will be spread in this sub and others as you search for validation. I sure hope this comment chain gets some visibility because the anger, self hatred, depression and overall pitiful state you are in is EXTREMELY entertaining :) made my day for sure.
