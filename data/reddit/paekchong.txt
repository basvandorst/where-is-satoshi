This is why some people choose to be pseudonymous.

Groestlcoin, it was the first coin to activate segwit. It has a low market cap but it will be able to take advantage of some of the technological advancements first because it seems to be ahead in the wallet department.

I am not an expert, here is what I understand.  When you normally make a transaction from one btc address to another you are paying the miners transaction fees.  Lightning network will be an off chain layer, you will move your coins into this "sidechain" where they can move around (and be swapped for other coins), eventually that channel you have been moving in will be closed and you will come back on chain to settle and pay any fees. But a lot of transactions can take place off chain that are not paying the normal mining fees.  
If anyone wants to step in and correct something I am saying or explain it better feel free :D

It’s huge for all segwit coins!

None of us know the future, but I see one that has many different coins in the ecosystem.  Maybe I am traveling in Japan where Mona is really popular and I can instantly swap some of my LTC for Mona to spend at a shop that has a mona wallet.  Maybe I am in the Netherlands and Groestlcoin is really popular there.  I also think we won't have one coin that does it all.  BTC is the most secure chain and it has the most hash power, it is the best place to keep your money long term in crypto. It isn't great for peer to peer payments right now, although more segwit adoption will help.  It just won't need to be, we will be able to swap in and out of segwit coins with ease.  If everyone started using LTC and we get a lot more adoption, than LTC would start to see some of the issues that BTC is currently facing, but with all these segwit coins we can always swap into whatever is cheapest or most convenient while keeping our savings in the big bad BTC.

I suppose, you could trade your gold (BTC) for silver (LTC) on the promissory note side chain (lightning network).

BTC can essentially stay an expensive store of value and you can swap back and forth between coins like LTC, VTC, GRS for sending and spending.  It will make scaling virtually limitless.

My understanding is that we atomic swaps will be like decentralized match making. Eventually we can have apps that have keep a live market rate for all segwit coins, when you want to sell your BTC for some VTC, or some LTC for some GRS etc, you will say how much you want to sell and the app will match you with users looking for the coin are selling.  It will happen off chain so fees will be really low.  Since the tech is just now being made a reality, we are probably a little ways out yet on the user interfaces.

It's already hit on Bitthumb
