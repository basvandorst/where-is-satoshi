Still relevant!

I hate to break it to you but Bitcoin is priced in 'Fiat'.

Technical analysis = Fortune telling with better branding.

You don't know your history.  Google 'The Thin Crust/Deep Dish Conversion Panic of 1983'.  It doesn't work.

This post isn't aging well.

Who only saves for the future in cash?
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:14:01
When you realize that you were right about bitcoin fanboys not understanding how the economy works.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:49:32
Sure they did. Everyone did everything right and everyone is a millionaire.
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:42:49
I'm in finance. I understand everything about technical analysis. It's a fraud.

Diversification, problem solved.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:07:17
I inferred from your point that you think there is going to be new highs.  There is nothing that gurantees that.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:36:33
That's called smart investing.  Your bank account isn't a scoreboard, but if you're happy and satisfied, you're winning.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:51:58
Why is that 'more realistic'?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:51:01
So that happened.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:29:49
So never sell? Ever? 
Cause there's no direction but up...no ceiling!
Never heard that mantra before.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:54:31
You're the one claiming the chances of bitcoin reaching 1 mil is 100%.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:09:26
Why so angry and attack ready.  How about you just explain your point like an adult.  
Nothing in finance is guaranteed.  Nothing.  No matter what does or does not happen, there is no gurantee that a price of a relevant asset will act accordingly.
So 
1.) Assuming an action is a guarantee of a future price is flawed (especially in the short term).
2.) Assuming that an event will unfold as you predict is pure hubris.
What event are you so certain is going to happen, that you are so certain is going to mean a non-stop increase in bitcoin value.
Also, getting angry because I am using a coin flip as an analogy of uncertainty is infantile.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:03:07
Not trolling.  I'm waiting for an actual answer. Are you the one trolling?
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:15:25
So then I guess you have liquidated every asset you have and put it all in bitcoin.  You must be a billionaire with your prognostication powers.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:32:51
Also, predictions of future events are always as good as flipping a coin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:19:24
My comment was more about selling at a high point vs holding for a potentially higher point, not about speculative investing in general.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:10:44
So no investment has ever gone belly up?  No investment, index, RE development, has ever tanked and never regained it's previous high?
Neither is true.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:16:58
Yes I would have.
My point is that investing is not a game show, it's doesn't have to be gambling.  Holding on to a stock only because you think there is no ceiling is the best way to lose money.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:39:21
You compared your prediction to the sun rising.  That's a very healthy 'could'.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:29:48
Yeah, why sell at a high? /s
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:26:39
In the investment world, prognostications are a coin flip.  Comparing investing to assured events makes you look like an idiot.
@_date: 2018-08-10 06:41:07
It's as valid as the first 1,682,488.
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:59:06


Who cares.  We also haven't been in a recession since Instagram was created.  What does one have to do with the other?
@_date: 2018-08-10 18:10:25
Explain your point.
Bitcoin is owned by 5% of US citizens, and even a smaller percentage of the world population.  Bitcoin makes up less than one one thousandth of a percent of the total worldwide currency.  It's affect on the world economy is minimal.  So again, OPs point is simple speculation.
@_date: 2018-08-06 23:12:24
Now do one for the people who invested last year and lost two thirds of their money!!
@_date: 2018-08-10 16:31:03
I didn't say recessions and down markets don't happen, I'm saying trying to predict them is fruitless.
@_date: 2018-08-10 16:32:43
There's no argument.  Everyone tries to predict what the market is going to do.  Only a tiny percentage of predictions turn out to be correct and that's mostly due to good timing 
@_date: 2018-08-10 05:50:20
This is market crash prediction number 1,682,489 since 2011.  Maybe this will be the one that's right.
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:07:46
You commented too soon.
