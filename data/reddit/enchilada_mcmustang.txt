What a load of crap, farming has always been seasonal and there was no predictability, if it didn't rain people would just starve, and that never prevented population growth. I'm guessing Uber drivers and farm laborers don't have children too...
All those mexicans crossing the border to pick oranges when it's harvest are also known for having few children apparently.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:28:48
Corporations are simply a way of organizing work, in the future corporations as we know today will not exist anymore because the collaborative economy and contracting out, rather than hiring employees, will prove more efficient, like Uber has proved.












- the less the costs of organizing and the slower these costs rise with an increase in the transactions organized.
- the less likely the entrepreneur is to make mistakes and the smaller the increase in mistakes with an increase in the transactions organized.
- the greater the lowering (or the less the rise) in the supply price of factors of production to firms of larger size.
The first two costs will increase with the spatial distribution of the transactions organized and the dissimilarity of the transactions. This explains why firms tend to either be in different geographic locations or to perform different functions. Additionally, technology changes that mitigate the cost of organizing transactions across space will cause firms to be larger—the advent of the telephone and cheap air travel, for example, would be expected to increase the size of firms. On a related note the use of the internet and related modern information and communication technologies seem to lead to the existence of so-called virtual organizations.

I don't think you understand the true value of blockchain/crypto. Let's say a software company creates an application, they control it and can decide who access it and who doesn't, their revenue comes feom granting clients access to its application and they can do that because they own it. The good part of owning the application is that they control it but this has a downside, since the company controls it they can't assure beyond all doubt that the application won't be modified or changed in some way, so the clients need to trust the company.
What blockchain allows us to do is to create decentralised applications(dApps) which allows us to take the trusting part out of the equation, the users know without doubt that the rules of the game can't be changed. But this has a downside, you can only assure you can't modify it if you renounce control over it, and that's what happens when you upload a dApp to a blockchain you lose all control over it, even the control to decide who has and hasn't access to it. That's where cryptocurrencies become relevant, the way we have found to give the content creators an economic incentive to create these applications and give them up to the network is by creating a cryptocurrency embedded in its code that solves who has access to it and who doesn't.
The point is to block bitcoin or crypto would mean to stiffle economic growth in an unprecedented way, the economies that allowed crypto would be hundreds of times more efficient than those who don't, it would be suicide to ban crypto and decentralisation.

The truth is that Bitcoin isn't worth what is worth because of usability, the truth is that a lot of people don't trust the traditional economy and are looking at ways to hedge against it, people just want to get rid of their dollars and store their wealth somewhere else. And as someone that understands the potential of the technology I can tell you that they're making a smart move. Blockchain technology and cryptography can give you the same benefits fiat can give you and at a cost that is orders of magnitude cheaper.

The system is supported by the demand for dollars, a high demand for dollars allows the US to keep very low interest rates and expansionary monetary policy. The dollar is in turn supported by oil trade which, since 1972, has overwhelmingly done in US dollars. Circumstances are changing though, renewables will undermine oil trade in the long run, and in the short run countries like China want to buy oil in their own currencies. What this mean is that demand for US dollars could fall sharply and the US is faced with 2 options, either to reduce supply to stabilize the dollar value, or keep a high supply and face hyperinflation.
The US government has way too many obligations to reduce supply as it wouldn't be able to face them, so the most likely scenario it'll let inflation run. When inflation runs wild savers look for other currencies to protect their savings. When this happens there will be certain deflationary currencies that will offer just that.
Like it or not the era of the dollar as the only international currency is coming to an end, and shit could really hit the fan.

Your problem is that you can't picture that the control governments will have over citizens will be much lower, not because of bitcoin, but because of globalization, bitcoin will just make it easier by erasing the borders the money will go through. What will actually happen is that high net worth individuals will shop for jurisdictions, and will move to the country that offers them the best deal, when that government tries to have too much control over their assets these individuals will just move elsewhere. You can't fight this without resorting to draconian measures which will just make more people want to leave and make your government the bad guy, think of communist regimes, do you think western governments will resort to building Berlin walls?

I always use the air analogy when explaining scarcity. People tend to equate value with use value, but if use value was the only important thing then air would be the most valuable thing in the world, but people in very very rarely situations pay for air, because it is so abundant. That's why scarcity is as important as utility to determine value.
