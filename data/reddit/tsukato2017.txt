Hahaha! Good for you! Who needs that bitch! She’ll be crawling back in a while. Give her both barrels!
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:56:04
WTF! There’s no validity to that charge, whatsoever.

Nice poetry. Just about sums it all up.

Lastly, I don't want to come off as anti-PLA. By far, the most decent, and finest people I've known in china, were all military. Very stand up, no bullshit, likable people.

PS: I stand by my assumption that top party members want their piece of the pie. That's the way it works there. I had a friend in the people's congress from jilin. He gave me the whole rundown on how these things work. Maybe you have higher level acquaintances than mine, but I kind of doubt it.

Less supply from Chinese miners, means more demand and higher price.

I actually know many high ranking officers in the PLA, many of whom, have been to the states. I'm just going on what they tell me. I'm no fan of the states either, if you misunderstand me.

You misunderstood. I'm saying nothing about the Chinese economy as a whole. I'm talked by primarily about the higher portion of the Party. These people have their hands in, and a cut, in any high profit venture in the country. Two factions make up the party, and there's tons of murders, imprisonments, etc, when a new faction is in charge. A real purging you don't hear about in the news.
Be as skeptical as you like. Who the fuck are you to me.
I do have friends in china, and a Chinese wife. But of course I bash them, and don't think highly of most of them, that's for sure. But there's an old saying in china that goes like this: nobody hates the Chinese more than the Chinese.
No truer words were ever uttered.

Seriously, I don't care if people like you, don't read it.
Try wearing glasses.

Great. So everyone's afraid? They oughta be afraid of life without this opportunity.
@_date: 2017-09-14 04:35:07
You really care about grammar? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:18:53
That's good to hear. ��
@_date: 2017-09-24 11:45:57
Too funny!
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:33:45
Oh! Well then, I think I agree with you. A lot of these people are kids just out of school. No experience. Big dreams, inheriting a destroyed economy from the cunts we know as Boomers. I say cut em some slack. They've inherited a bleak landscape.

First hand sources far fetched? Do you know the significance of the city of Tianjin? If not, you know nothing about the functionings of the Party and business.

Go kill yourself you fucking bipedal urinal-goblin hybrid!

Good for you! Poor Robin. Latin America’s where it’s at, if you ever sicken of the female version of Penguinicus Americanus.
Best wishes brother, but always remember two things:
1.  Always hide a portion of your assets, preferably in cryptos, and don’t tell her.
2.  For every beautiful woman, there is a man who got sick of her shit.
Vaya con dios mi amigo ��

BTW, English is not my native language Einstein. Sorry if my grammar and whatnot, aren't perfect. Are you a native English speaker? If so, then you're a real cunt.
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:42:49
Why would you ever tell your wife?! Retard!

I think a lot of these "get rich quick people" are people who've found themselves in untenable circumstances, working for slave wages, in a highly inflationary environment, through no fault of their own. Of course they're gonna feel downturns more keenly. This is probably their only hope to escape serfdom.
You've got a big heart though.

So happy to have been of service. ��

Big deal. That would pay for about 8 hr of pentagon expenses..
