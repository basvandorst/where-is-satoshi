I swear a new BTC mining company shows up EVERY DAY! I cannot do anything by LOL every time I see one of these.
Just for shits and giggles, post other Mining companies that have popped up in the last few weeks/months. Always in for a good laugh looking at the photoshopped pictures

I have been looking into CedarTec for a few days and have been talking with a few other guys on other forums. I have made the decision to purchase a single unit and see if they follow through. I now things seem a little sketchy but so did Avalon up until they delivered their product a few days ago and now EVERYONE wants one. Its only $1000, I have lost more money in more stupid things throughout my life.
I will keep everyone updated as time goes by. I will either have an ASIC machine here in May or just be out $1000
Wish me luck

CampBX is my personal choice, when there site is working. I like them because they are local to me and I can literally run down to their office and leave an envelope with the receptionist to deliver to them. After drop off my money is in my account within a few hours.
Before CampBX i was using CoinBase as well as Bitinstant. At the moment Bitinstant is going through some renovations, so CoinBase looks like a good alternative.
The only thing bad about just starting out with CoinBase is the 30 day wait in order to get instant coins. Also the max of 50BTC at a time is sometimes annoying when making big purchases.
There are a million different sites out there, before you pick one, make sure to do a little research about them. Last thing you want is to loose your money before you even have it
