Looks great, congrats!
Did you have to style it much yourself or is that out of the box, as in you just define the colors and specify icons?

Good stuff!

Probably some tumblr niche is my guess.

That's sorta the premise of it all, is it not?

It's not a science journal, it's a well-argued idea.
A kinda plausible one at that.

Who says that?
I always saw this as a viral part of the endgame. It's what truly makes a currency, no?

Yep, but in this case it's not wrapping, it's masking – otherwise the text wouldn't be continuous through different fields of color.
Photoshop can mask in a pixel-based way, but not discrete letters – as can be seen on where the orange meets the white.
Only way I can think of doing this in PS is by creating a completely black&amp;white circle (no greytones) in a rather low resolution based on the amount of lines/colums of text you want to have and with a pre-set pixel aspect ratio of that of a letter, then scale that up using "nearest neighbour" (so you don't get grey interpolation) and use that as a mask.
Though at that point it's probably a lot faster doing it in processing or the likes.

I doubt it's Photoshop, look at the letters at the edge of the B. Instead of being cut of, they have their color changed. I'd say it's procedurally generated.

Look at the tip of the cart, he goes forward fast.
Look at the rails, he creeps backwards.
