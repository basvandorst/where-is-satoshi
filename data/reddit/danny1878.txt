Same, although I do still check the price now and again, just don't stress about it. Volatility is to be expected, we're still at the very early adoption stage.

I read a story the other day about how in the 13th century in one part of the world, they used wampum shells as a currency.  Wampum shells are a type of seashell, which live far out to sea, so only occasionally wash up on shore.  The shells have absolutely no intrinsic value, but were sufficiently scarce, easily recognisable, and could not be faked.  
These were eventually replaced by gold coins as the shells could not be used internationally.  Swapping the shells for coins gave rise to the term 'shelling out'.  
The point is, there's no requirement to be 'backed' by something for a currency to serve it's purpose.

Earning bitcoin through mining would be taxed as a trade, so income tax rules.  Same as any job or self-employed business.

Say you open a channel to bitstamp to trade with.  In this case you are still holding your funds in your own wallet, so it's non-custodial.  No KYC/AML required from Bitstamp.  When you trade, the btc just passes straight through their LN node to the seller.

Do you think the infamous 'bart' trading pattern typical of bitcoin is a result of high value cross-border payments?  Say I've got $50m I need to send to Australia.  I buy $50m of bitcoin, this spikes the price a little, I send the bitcoin to the new address, it takes an hour to get enough confirmations, then the bitcoin is sold on the other side causing the price to crash back down a bit again.

Plus, gold was used as money way before it had any utility in electronics and manufacturing.  That's irrelevant to bring a good money. Rather it's limited supply, counterfeit protection, fungibility is what made it a good money. Bitcoin has all those properties and more.

Gold down 2% today, which is pretty big in the gold market.  Do you think there is starting to be some correlation between bitcoin and gold?  Gold was moving up big at the same time bitcoin had its run up to $14k.  
If we're starting to see a correlation, then that means investors are starting to view bitcoin as 'digital gold'.   Bullish?!

Agree, this is purely short-term sell pressure pushing down prices.  Should definitely see this as a buying opportunity.  Has no impact on bitcoin's long-term value.  As soon as the big dumps stop the price always starts creeping up again.  An that's before the halvening!

Unspent transaction outputs - basically bits of bitcoin of various sizes, which can be spent by those who own them.  The amount of them doesn't really matter, and nothing to be particularly bothered about, it's just how bitcoin works.  
If you want to transfer 1 bitcoin to someone else, you could use a utxo that you own (larger than 1 bitcoin) as the input for the transaction.  Say the utxo is 10 btc in size.  That's the input that then becomes spent, an you'll receive a 9 btc utxo as change.
Wallets take care of all this automatically.

I think your understanding is a bit off here:


Opening a channel doesn't lock up your funds, it's UNLOCKING your funds.  Think of it as moving cash from your safe to your wallet.   An every channel you have open with your friends is money that you CAN spend in a shop.  You don't need a channel directly with each shop or friend you want to transact with.  That's the whole point.  A channel open with your friend could be used to buy your coffee or place an online order (assuming your friend also has a couple of channels open).

Will we all stop using the old internet and move to the new one?  It's just not going to happen, bitcoin has such a headstart now it's uncatchable.  So much infrastructure has been built around bitcoin, trust gained in the system, it's a global brand now.  There's still space for other coins however, with various different niche use-cases.  But as the main digital store of value, I think bitcoin's got it wrapped up.

@_date: 2019-10-03 12:37:01
Here's what's going to happen over the next 12 months:
* Halvening - major supply shock.  Bitcoin close to having the worlds best stock-to-flow ratio.
* 1+ year of development on bitcoin core (graftroot, taproot, schnorr, dandelion etc)
* 1+ year of development on lightning (loopin, wallets, Olympus, AMP, eltoo etc)
* More education, awareness, on-ramps, polish. 
* More trust in bitcoin, useless shitcoins will continue to die.
* Fiat currencies continuing to deteriorate, interest rates going down/negative.
Given that backdrop, and the potential halvening hype and media coverage, I can't see any realistic scenario where the price of bitcoin would fall from where we are now.  How high it will go, I don't know.  But bitcoin must be one of the best investments in terms of risk and reward that there is right now. 
You might lose 20% of your capital, or you might 10x it.

Good question.  A halvening reduces the supply of new bitcoin into the world, which tends to be good for price which is based on supply/demand.  For miners it is bad, as their mining reward is lower, but given the price tends to rise per bitcoin, the miner impact is mitigated.

It's called hedonics. The price of an iPhone has been consistent or even increasing over the years, but because today's iPhone is 4x as fast as the first generation, the cost of a smartphone that they use to calculate inflation will be 25% of the actual cost.  This artificially keeps the inflation rate low. 
Also substitution - if the price of chicken goes up too much, then they just assume everyone will buy turkey instead, an swap the price out. 
@_date: 2019-10-03 12:14:38
Got a feeling the term 'stock-to-flow ratio' is going to be used a lot over the next year or two.  This is the first time any asset class has come close to having a similar stock-to-flow ratio as gold.  Then bitcoin is going to blow past it.

 "Everyone's talking about Bitcoin and how to get it," said Mahsa Alimardani, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, who grew up in Iran.
With US sanctions over its nuclear programme hitting Iran financially, Iranians often discuss via social media the question of how wealth can be stored securely, she added. Gold and US dollars are long-standing popular suggestions.
"Bitcoin and \[other cryptocurrencies\] are slowly coming up as the third alternative," she told the BBC.

It used to.  There's too many people doing it now, which eliminates the profit.  Any variances between exchanges today can usually be explained due to higher withdrawal /other fees, which when taken into account, mean there isn't really a price difference.  
Also, some exchanges may have a higher price due to the increased perceived risk of using that exchange.
There's no free lunch unfortunately.

Libra shouldn't take any users away from bitcoin - like, nobody who's into crypto is going to trade in their bitcoins for Libra coins.  But it'll bring the normies much closer to the crypto space.  If they're comfortable with Libra, it's a small step into the real crypto.

Not very well debated on the bitcoin side. He should have shut Peter down on a number of ridiculous claims.
Gold wasn't money 1000 years ago because it can be used in dentistry and electronics. It's money because it was scarce, couldn't be counterfeit, and was easily recognisable.  All properties bitcoin has.  However bitcoin is even better money, as it can be transferred electronically, and is easily divisible.
Also, the mining point made no sense, sure you mine gold once then you're done. But bitcoin only gets mined once and it's also done. The electricity being used in the bitcoin network is also processing thousands of transactions. Moving value all around the world.  How much energy would be needed to ship the same amount of gold all over the world?

@_date: 2019-04-19 18:35:02
Sure.  So at the moment on the lightning network, if your lightning node dies then you've potentially lost access to the funds in your lightning channels.  Channel backups fixes this problem, and allows you to close the channel and receive whatever bitcoin you are due off the LN.  This removes a lot of risk, which was a potential obstacle for some.  
Watchtowers further provide a safety net.  If your node goes offline for a period of time it's possible that a counter-party can try to steal the funds in your channel.  Watchtowers keep an eye on things for you and if your offline and someone broadcasts an old channel state, then the watchtower will step in on your behalf and make sure no funds are lost. 
AMP stands for Atomic multipath payments.  At the moment, when you send/receive funds on the LN, 100% of the transaction needs to transfer through the same channel.  If you have two $100 channels, meaning $200 total on the LN, the most you can send in one transaction is $100, because that's your individual channel capacity.  With AMP, a single transaction can be split up across multiple channels.  So you max transaction will go up to $200 as you can send half on one channel, and the other half on the other channel at the same time.  Some clever tricks mean that the transaction only goes through if 100% of the funds send successfully. 
Hope that makes sense.

There's usually valid reasons for it.  For example BTC-A-Trade has higher withdrawal fees, so the price of bitcoin tends to be higher as people try an recoup the withdrawal fee when they sell.

The ideal product to spur adoption would be a plug and play lightning node box, that you can give to a retailer.  Which:
* Lets them easily take bitcoin /lightning payments
* Saves them money compared to visa/mastercard/paypal
* Offers a monthly report that they can use for record keeping / taxes. 
* Lets them immediately convert to fiat if they wish.
You could then either sell it, or give this to merchants free, and program it to direct a few satoshi's your way on each transaction.

The point is - someone is paying for our ability to move money in the banking system.  The fee isn't explicitly attached to the transaction like it is with bitcoin.

Jihan Wu is a big BCH supporter, and was CEO of Bitmain who sell crypto miners.
They made massive profits in 2017, but a combination of bad business decisions, the bear market, over-estimating future miner demand, going all-in on BCH etc has caused massive losses to the firm this year.  
Bitmain, under Wu's leadership has been a big buyer of BCH to support the price, and a seller of BTC to fund the business.  They're now left with around 1m BCH, which after a disasterous fork, has a falling market price and little trade volume.  If they tried to offload them it would effectively crash the market.  
So the firm is in trouble big time, which is why they're closing offices left and right, and Wu has stepped down from CEO.  They're also in the middle of an IPO listing which means they have to disclose lots of financial info to investors - which is where a lot of the info is coming from.  The IPO is now a bit of a joke, given they valued themselves initially as a $40bn business, but rumours are they made a $1.2bn loss last year!

You should read up on how LBC works.  I think you transfer the BTC to escrow, they pay you.  You confirm receipt of payment then the BTC goes to the buyer.

It dipped as low as mid-30's during the alt-coin craze.  It's been slowly creeping up for a while as the air seeps out of the alt bubbles.  A lot of shitcoins are dying, so BTC's share of the market is increasing, now up to 70%.  
I think 70-80% is a good number for bitcoin.  Too many alt's just distract from the end-goal and spread investment/development too widely.  On the other hand a few alts are good to cover niche use-cases better than bitcoin can, and also as a kind of test bed for features/security etc.

I've drawn some lines on a graph, and also noticed we've only gained 20% so far this week.  That means we're still definitely in a bear market, crash is imminent and we're heading to 4k.

Why does that happen? Surely the miners could make more money by validating and adding more transactions to the block and collecting the fees?
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:37:23
There's a few bitcoin debit cards available. They just effectively convert your bitcoin to fiat at the point of sale.  So you're still paying with fiat really.  
To actually transfer bitcoin you need to be connected to the internet, so a printed QR code won't work.

@_date: 2019-05-15 15:27:09
The low after each additional bull run has historically been between 3 and 22 times as high as the previous low.  If history repeats, that means the dip after the next bull run will bottom out at $9k at least.

@_date: 2018-12-04 17:36:09
It all hinges on confidence in the USD.  Once the next recession starts, QE will start again - printing billions of paper money to prop up an over-inflated stock market bubble or save the housing market.  Interest rates will hit the floor or go negative.  The debt pile will grow substantially.
Who in their right mind would hold fiat in this scenario?  People had no choice in 2008, but they have an alternative now.
@_date: 2019-05-09 08:56:17
Thought there would be more resistance at $6k given how long we hovered here before the drop.   
Having said that, assuming the next bull run takes us to a new ATH - investing now means you'll probably quadruple your money (400% return) in the next year or two.
@_date: 2019-05-06 19:01:18
A RESTful API would be better for me.  At lot of other exchanges have REST API's which I use, so less work to adapt any code.

You'll be sorry went it blasts straight through to $9k.
@_date: 2019-05-03 08:31:06
So assuming you bought all available bitcoins with your $1000.  ~~Today that would be worth the entire market cap of bitcoin, almost $100bn.~~  Plus about $400 you had left over from your initial investment.

@_date: 2018-12-20 14:27:21
Great work.  
In terms of speeding adoption though, would you consider giving merchants use of your product for free for say 6 or 12 months?   That would be a real incentive for merchants to get over the initial technical hurdles and hassle of adding a new payment option.  Paying 1% to atomicpay, instead of say 2% for visa, isn't that much of an incentive IMO.  Especially when the number of customers paying in bitcoin will probably be a small percentage of customers.
Also, it would mean the vendors could offer incentives to pay in bitcoin e.g. free shipping, which would give an incentive to customers to download a wallet and get into the crypto ecosystem.  I understand you want to make a return on your product, but a free/trial period of 0% fees could be a good way to get long term customers.

What if this idea was dreamt up by BCH shills to cripple the network and max out the fees?  What if they're going to spam the network leading up to Jan 3rd as well.  Then they'll be able to push their narrative that bitcoin doesn't work, can't scale etc.  
An say multiple exchanges have issues processing all the transactions - what does that do to bitcoin's reputation?  I feel like this is an unnecessary stress test.

Something to do with Bitmain trying to prop up the price before their financial year end.  If the price is too low, they have to write down the value of all their holdings, and they'll get rekt by the auditors / IPO investors.
The liquidity is so low in BCH, it doesn't seem to take much to move the market.

Hi, I've been through the guide, an I've finished the bitcoin page. Everything seems to be working fine, blockchain verification progress got up to 65%, then I get a network connection error.

Any suggestions on what I could do to fix this?
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:52:35
What are the implications of this?  I mean, it sounds like a good technical feat, but why should we care?  So you can swap a shitcoin on the Eth network for some Satoshi's on the lightning network directly - what problem does this solve?
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:05:07
I expect it's a short-term spike due to binance re-opening deposits and withdrawals.  It'll be cleared down in a day or so.

Depends on your perspective, you could argue we've never been out of one - so 10 years. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:08:59
In my view - supply is massively inflated right now as bitmain and others sell their btc to fund the hashwars on BCH.  Plus other miners are selling to pay the bills, or selling whilst they can, anticipating further price falls.  Many are mining at a loss until enough leave the game and difficulty adjusts downwards, forcing any BTC savings to be liquidated in the short-term.  
On top of that buyers are sitting tight waiting for the bottom, so demand is suppressed.  However, once enough people consider we at the bottom, I believe all the money sitting on the sidelines will move back in and we'll see a pretty big bounce back up.  FOMO kicks in, and selling pressures on miners will go away.  
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:06:05
