Awesome!  Thanks for the order.  I hope that as time goes on, I will be lucky enough to keep building Zealots &amp; Villains and with that, I can be able to do faster international shipping.  
When you get the shirt, don't forget to tag us on social if you use Instagram or Twitter.  And, again, can't stress it enough... appreciate the support!

But honestly, this shirt is total respect for people like him, who actually believe in bitcoin enough to push for use cases.

We do.  :)

This was the Satoshi Retirement Club design he was referring to, just in case anyone was wondering.  It's not available on any shirts or apparel yet.  Just a tote bag :)

Spending 10k btc on two pizzas tend to hollow a person out if you know what I mean.

Hmmm.  This seems... a little off putting.

You have no idea how much that means to me to hear that.  Appreciate it man.

That's us!  Thanks for linking man... I didn't want to get spammy so I didn't include the name or shop link.
I'm glad you like the Satoshi Retirement Club design.  I'm gonna try to get that on a shirt or hoody soon but all the layouts I've been toying with on apparel has just felt a little off.  I'll keep trying though and hopefully I'll get it out soon!
Anyway, I appreciate the love.
