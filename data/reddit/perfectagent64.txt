This looks great so far! Have you thought about implementing a system of regular payouts for people who are engaged in a group buy so that the operator doesn't need to split up payments? I understand that that was a big reason people went with ghash.
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:04:02
Yeah, but we've never switched from http, IP, and whatnot. That's more analogous to BTC.

I think you can go on the Blockchain.info site on the browser and see that way. If not, you can try [Block Explorer]( It's not nearly as pretty, but it gets the job done. You may have to refresh to see new transactions though.

An even bigger challenge with the point that touches fiat is that it is oftentimes a pain to get cash money into an exchange.

ASICs can mine SHA256 coins, like Bitcoin and Namecoin. Normally, you would point an ASIC at a single coin (basically Bitcoin), but since Namecoin can be mergemined, using an ASIC you can mine NMC and BTC. Also, this is why most altcoins are scrypt, since a 51% attack on a new SHA altcoin would be too easy to do.

Well, the six is an official "this is good enough" number of transactions in that you're basically guaranteed that a doublespend is nearly impossible at that point. Your transactions still get confirmed after this number, and there is nothing technically significant about the number. For example, my first transaction on my qt client has over 15000 confirmations.

If this could somehow happen (which from the looks of it can't), this goes against the principles of Bitcoin, as well as ensure the network is less secure. Not everybody wants to mine and that is fine. People who do want to mine are performing a great service and deserve to be compensated for their work in verifying transactions and securing the network. If they invest more in doing so, that can only be a good thing.Also, in real life, there is a barrier of entry to starting your own shuttle service (as an example), but those who provide that service deserve to be compensated, even if there are many that cannot do so.

A protocol is different from a service though, especially when it comes to adoption. For example, TCP/IP has been used since the 80s (granted, not the same version), and the first version of HTTP was in 1991. Unless there is a fatal flaw in Bitcoin or if there's a much better protocol, I can only see Bitcoin maybe having different versions like those protocols.

The funny thing is that I've asked quite a few people I know, and the majority believe that the value of the dollar still comes from gold reserves. Of course this wasn't a scientific poll or anything, but just something I've observed.

They wanted to know where he got the bond money from.

Apollo 13's astronauts are the humans who have traveled farther from Earth than any other.

Same thing for me too, filled out a ticket and they took care of it.
@_date: 2013-06-02 22:11:13
I don't think it would though, as the reward is 50BTC here, and I think it's a separate blockchain.

The impression I get from those people is that they're so self-important.

There are quite of few people who want to own a whole unit and now say that they won't be able to get into Bitcoin now because each Bitcoin is too expensive.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:29:05
Will twerk for Bitcoins.

Well, he has.

But the knife hysteria particularly in the UK.

is a longwinded way of saying that.
@_date: 2013-06-19 14:10:13
10%-20%? What.
@_date: 2013-06-28 12:14:18
Maybe with gpus, because ASICs are much more energy efficient.
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:23:53
Fifty of them in fact.

Seeing as basically every place that delivers where I am is on GrubHub, this would be really amazing. The only problem is that I might have trouble holding onto my Bitcoins. :p

An increase that fast is completely unsustainable. It was bound to crash.

Have blocks really been hitting the blocksize limit? I always thought they've been around half the limit or less.

Zerocoin is more something that can be implemented in other coins though, innit? Unless the devs are also releasing their own coin.

They hate capitalism, so they make a new currency subject to the free market force that is at the heart of capitalism. Ok.

One way to get some is to sell stuff for Bitcoins. Try coingig or bitmit.net

Best promotion of Bitcoin: Best news story: Best comment: Best miscellaneous post: Best overall submission: I'd say it was a clean sweep.

For sure I agree that most of the altcoins are worthless (just check the multitude of new alts every week in the alternate cryptocurrencies on the bitcointalk.org forums!), but some do have a place if they differentiate themselves sufficiently. Namecoin for example is a new DNS registration system done in a peer to peer manner. In any case, none of these crapcoins will get enough faith and acceptance to really put any dent into Bitcoin (especially with names like RealCoin - The coin for real life).

Or as smaller scale laboratories separate from Bitcoin for study. For example, with feathercoin, we were able to see a 51% attack in action.I understand the author's sentiment though, that altcoins for the sake of altcoins will fall flat.Interesting that Namecoin wasn't addressed though....editI can't say that focusing on mining is a good idea, because it was only added to solve the problem of doublespending. To focus on the miners is like building a currency around "money printers," which would make such a currency useless.

If you don't mind me asking, what's a support glyph?

A much better way of putting it is this:If you bought bitcoin at anytime except for that two week period in April, your purchasing power has increased.
@_date: 2013-07-10 14:24:02
It just makes the remaining BTC more valuable because there's less out there. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 16:32:05
Yep. But that's in combination with difficulty uncreasing as well. After a while, transaction fees will take a larger share of the earnings until the block reward becomes zero, where transaction fees will be the entirety of the miners' earnings.
@_date: 2013-06-15 16:34:31

And I like how you're using something that doesn't just use the standard QR code for an address thing. I should look into this.

About your last point, another way people can be rewarded for helping on a project like that is paying bitcoins based on how much processing power they offer.
