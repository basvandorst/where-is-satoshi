How much time does it take you to work to be able to pay for netflix? How much time do you think it takes people there to make the same amount of money?

Ukrainian banks are the same as GOX, this is they you get 20% on your saving account for Hrivna, and ~10% for USD.
Look at 2004 and 2008 banking crises in Ukraine.

The miners confirming the block are the 3rd party, and fees do exist. If you do not add a fee, your transaction might take much longer to confirm, this lag increases with the number of transactions per seconds. I believe with the current block size of 1M there is a limit of about 7 transactions per second.

If the price goes on a downtrend or even flat lines, a large amount of bitcoins will be offered for sale (by the speculators) which will crash the price, as there will not be enough short term demand for it.
The main issue is that bitcoins are a new an unproven product for most.

Are you aware that it is possible to track every bitcoin all way back to the blocks were it was mined. It might not be a simple task, but it is a task that can be automated. You can also track all transactions back to exchanges, where the account will usually have people or companies tied to them.

English is not my native language. Wikipedia provides a good list of sources at the bottom and I do not really see a reason to retype what is says.
Also there is a big difference between a Communist country, and a country ruled by what is called the Communist Party.
Marxist revolutions did start both countries, but Power corrupts and Politicians are similar in all countries.

I guess then this person has not tried to sell anything online. As the hardest part is actually getting clients to start trusting a merchant.
If you are a seller you should price into your product the price is dealing with cheats, which you will get no mater how you take payment.

What you call "communism" is not what I call "communism". A 1 min video of a comedian stating something does not make it a fact. I would like to see some more evidence or analysis supporting your point.

The simplest and easiest way to kill of bitcoin and the lot would be to tightly regulate what data can and cannot be transmitted over the Internet. Basically killing off p2p connections or severely limiting them would cause chain forks, and then making owning servers in data centers more difficult. Big companies that own data centers would love it (Google, Facebook, Yahoo... and the like), as they will be given a monopolies on niches on the Internet, basically turning the Internet into Cable TV 2.0.
A person needs to be a naive idiot to think that this will not be resisted. 
And most of the worlds population would be supporting the resistance, as like you said they will be majorly screwed by this change.

A "Bank Run" is the wrong word. The right term is "Selloff".
There is a set amount of Currency (not bitcoins) in the System that is being traded for the Bitcoints, and people want to trade their coins for the said amount before the price drops down too much, which will actually drop the price as all ~~that~~ the people who wanted to buy at those price have already done so.

Let us say you have 10 BTC in your wallet, and you buy something for 0.001 BTC, the ledger will log two transaction: 1 - 0.001 BTC (your payment) 2 - 9.999 BTC (BTC going back to your wallet), so the volume transfered will 10 BTC even-though only 0.001 BTC were used. 
As opposed in Western Union, a transfer does not include the total balance of your account.

A large lot of bitcoins that were mined are lost for multiple reasons, like deleted wallets and formated systems, or bitcoins sent to invalid addresses. Most of this happened when bitcoins where under a cent.

Linux is much safer by design, but is not 100% safe. So my advice, is moving to Linux/BSD does not mean you can be stupid and go hopping to untrusted sites and installing things without knowing what you are doing.

Same issue exists with bitcoin, and it is even worst. If you overpay, and they do not want to review the books then you are screwed. With a CC you have the option to escalate the issue to your card provider.

Creationism is not a logical argument, it is a 'belief' system.
From wikipedia:
Science is a system of knowledge based on observation, empirical evidence and testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena. By contrast, creationism is based on literal interpretations of the narratives of particular religious texts. Some creationist beliefs involve purported forces that lie outside of nature, such as supernatural intervention, and often do not allow predictions at all.

People are forced into employment through monopolies. If a corporation has a monopoly on an activity and can undercut all others for a period of time (outspending). Look at Big box stores vs mom &amp; pop stores.
Moving to the woods is actually not an options, as people are forced to pay land tax and other bullshit, that you in the system.

Children and pensioners usually fall below the thresholds. Also how does that calculator handle these situations:
Family of 4 with 2 kids, with a combined income of 150K. Since the kids are not working and not paying taxes they will not be counted as tax payers.
Family of 4 with 2 kids, where only 1 parent works with an income of 150K. Since only one parents works does will it report that 75% of the population are not paying taxes?
With the above situations, people will not consider those families as non-contributors. But in one 50% contribute, and in the other only 25%. When those stats are shown, people immediately think of that the non-tax payers are slacking off, but I am not sure a stay at home parent slacks off (in most cases), no kids or the elderly should be expected to pay much income taxes if any.

A couple of points to consider:
1. When paypal started Github did not exist.
2. The mature and well defined API for paypal does not really require more than one implementation per language/shopping cart out there.
3. There is one paypal, while we have 10's of exchanges each with their own API and way of doing things.
