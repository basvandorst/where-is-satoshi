Sweet. Pasted the address that was in my archived  section on Blockchain.info into that and it shows my cash, gold etc that I can claim. Still totally confused as to why the 12 word seed isn’t working on electron cash, and zero balance showing on Blockchain.info wallet where I got the address from though. I’ll keep reading.

No this was pre the 12 random words time I think (but can’t clearly remember)

Install telegram messenger 
Then use the cryptoping bot to set custom price theshold alerts. It also notifies you when it sees large transactions on any coin

To those of you who wished me luck. Thank you. I just found an old password from around that time, on an old computer I had to rebuild, and it worked
Very relieved.
Question now is what to do with them. Sell or wait?

Hi, Thanks nekotribal, 
yes I have the encrypted wallet, and in fact Dave is on the case as of an hour or so ago, I’m trying to figure out if the possible password was something I made up (hope) or the app (2013 version)  made up (doomed)

Well done mate! I was there. Bought in 2013. Got the passphrase correct 2 weeks ago. I think only if you’ve lived the soul crushing, sleep disturbing, personality lacerating fear of never remembering can you empathise... 
This article is a good related read

This mindset is what starts mass hysteria. Or, ends mass hysteria.
