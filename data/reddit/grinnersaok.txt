Diversifying your Bitcoin with other 'crypto' (aka leveraged bitcoin with increased risk of total collapse) isn't diversification.
Diversify your Bitcoin with shares, fiat, real estate, gold etc.

@_date: 2018-09-16 01:27:35
It depends on your definition of money. I consider both fiat and gold to be money. 
I use gold as money, as do others saving ~$8 trillion worth of wealth in it. 
I transact day to day with a different money (fiat) as it works better for this purpose currently.
I 'use' Bitcoin in the same sense, and see that it's absolute fixed supply brings with it a whole new value proposition. It would make sense for an increased amount of 'wealth' to be stored in this asset for that reason; the monetary policy of a perfectly fixed supply cannot be improved upon in terms of a savings medium.

It can be a good learning experience to play around with SHA256: For example, this is an oversimplified version of how bitcoin works:
Pay Me Current Coinbase (12.5BTC) + All the transactions currently in the mempool + Nonce to find a hash starting with current difficulty number of 0's (11111111111111111
The above line produces a sha256 hash of "029F57FF0875262B3AA2DCE1222B2DEA170DAB2428C78145583ED2039824C1EA" 
Note it starts with a 0, (technically in hexidecimal code this is 4 zeros), so if the current difficulty required a starting hash of 4 0's, then the above hash would be a solution to my simplified bitcoin block above.
What is a part of the genius of bitcoin, is that the coinbase  reward (the payment to the miner) is part of the hashed data, so every miners solution will be unique. Further to that, each transaction in the block is also part of the hashed data, so that is what 'locks' transactions in the chain (so to speak).
Play around with the generator if you want:

My point is that people are conflating tracelessness with fungibility.
They are not the same thing:
Anonymity and untraceability are protections that help guarantee fungibility, but a lack of both doesn't negate fungibility.
@_date: 2018-09-16 06:14:09
For people interested in monetary theory it is pretty amazing to be alive to see an asset go from being 'not money' to 'money' in a single generation. This, being the first time this has occurred, is a once in human existence type event. Literally (without hyperbole).
I use the term 'money' in a broad sense (SoV/MoE, gold etc). 
@_date: 2018-08-21 11:49:37
I don't agree with the popular suggestion that anonymity/untraceability is synonymous with fungibility. 
Anonymity and untraceability protect fungibility, but they are not necessary to it. 
Cash is fungible (in some jurisdictions fungible by law) but not traceless (serial no.).
Saying Bitcoin is not fungible because Coinbase doesn't accept some UTXO's is like saying Cash is not fungible because John Doe only accepts notes with serial numbers ending in '888'.
Again, anonymity and untraceability are protections that help guarantee fungibility, but a lack of both doesn't negate fungibility.

I disagree, but it's better to put your money where your mouth is, so if you want to send me your tainted bitcoin, I'll buy them for 50 cents on the dollar. Not interested? I didn't think so.
Money (always) gets declared fungible by law (  ), this is the case because without fungibility money doesn't work. 
You seem to be confusing anonymity with fungibility. I understand the importance of fungibility, and understand that (just like cash - which is marked by serial numbers) bitcoin is (and will eventually be enshrined by law) fungible.
Having said that, I have no issue with XMR, and can appreciate that it's privacy/anonymity features offer another level of fungibility assurance.

It's not black and white :
When discussing this incident, Bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell said:
Sort of a mixed bag there, you can actually take a pre BIP-50 node and fully sync the blockchain, I last did this with 0.3.24 a few months ago. It just will not reliably handle reorgs involving large blocks unless you change the BDB config too. So it’s debatable if this is a hard fork either, since it’s quasi-non-deterministic. There were prior bugs fixed where older versions would get stuck and stop syncing the chain before that too… So I think by a really strong definition of creating a blockchain which violates the rules mandated by prior versions we have never had a hardfork.
@_date: 2019-03-31 21:58:08
You have this entirely backwards:
"The acceleration of inflation has been so fast that people have been trying to get rid of money. Money becomes a hot potato that nobody wants to hold, so what economists call the velocity of money starts going up." 
"This imbalance between the abundance of nominal money and the lack of goods and services in the marketplace triggers a drop in the real value of the bolivar and the purchasing power of citizens, who due to their expectations of higher inflation rates in the future avoid saving in the national currency and rush to spend the money they currently have.
"There's a rotation or a velocity of money much greater than in previous years," Garcia said of this phenomenon."

Respectfully, you are the one who is misunderstanding. Consider a complete chain re-write, and then compare this to a 'DOS' attack. A chain re-write is certainly more devastating. 
For more information,  has up to date data on the current number of days required for a complete chain re-write to occur if one were to get 100% of the hashing power. This time increases as the % decreases, to where if your % falls below 50%, you reach 'infinite' time to rewrite.
"Proof of work equivalent days to rewrite the complete BTC or BCH chain with 100% of available hashrate. Basically the same idea as the "fork rewrite" chart only for the entire blockchain".
Currently the network requires 50 days at current hashing power to rewrite the entire Bcash chain, and 242 days to re-write the entire Bitcoin chain.

Rather than downvote you should consider the possibility that you are wrong.
You can verify that you misunderstood by going back to the source and changing it to 4 years. You will see the graph doesn't change, it remains at &gt;15 million and the black vertical line moves. 
Try changing it to 7 years when 15 million coins hadn't even been mined and you will see the red line still shows &gt;15 million coins. The black vertical line is the important point.

It is what we're talking about. Specifically my responses have been to the person who stated "there [is]... certainly nothing that is a bigger danger than the denial of service". The suggestion that a 51% attacker can do nothing more than DDOS the chain is false. 
I've explained how a 51% attacker could cause a 96 block re-org in a 32.6 hour period as a demonstration that this is false. 
I guess I led you to respond that way by mentioning that it is technically possible to reorganise the whole chain, but I was only trying to show there that talking in absolutes is bad when there are outlying possibilities (even, as you correctly put it, if the chances of that specifically occurring is infinitesimally small).

If you have 51% hash power, and mine in secret (read: without broadcasting found blocks) for 100 blocks, then broadcast those blocks, you will create a 100 block re-org.
The only way this wouldn't occur is on the below average chance that the 49% of the network openly mining found more blocks than your 51%.

You have misunderstood the graph.
The vertical line shows the coins which have been dormant for 1 year, and it is at 7.97 million.
The red line is total coins that have not moved since the date stated on the X axis. Naturally, the closer to todays date the graph gets, the more coins there are that haven't moved since that date -&gt; This is why at todays date there are nearly 17 million coins that haven't moved since yesterday. 
You can tell this by changing the variable of years dormant.
Edit - Seen as the OP seems unwilling (or unable) to understand, I'll leave this here for others to see:

The hard part is getting the 51% hash power, after that it is basic math. I'm talking about the damage a 51% attack could do here.
It wouldn't take long. 100 blocks x 10 minutes / 0.51 is 32.6 hours. During that time, the 49% public chain would have produced 96 blocks (96 x 10 minutes x 0.49 =32.6 hours). You'd publish your 100 blocks, become the main chain (with a 4 block lead) and cause a 96 block re-org.
This isn't in a normal miners (bitmain et al.) best financial interest, but we are talking about what maximum damage an attacker (state sponsored for example) with 51% hash power could do, and its more than just DDOS.
I think your confusion might be coming from the fact that I am talking about a specific type of 51% attack from "secret mining" or "surprise attack" where the attacker doesn't publish his blocks as he finds them, thus the rest of the hashing power is unable to build on that chain, and aren't even aware of its existence until it is published.
If you want to read about it more, Gavin Andreessen talked about it years ago on github here: 
Andreessen refers to it from a financial gain standpoint, rather than a state sponsored attack to inflict maximum damage via re-org but the logic is the same:
Scenario C: an attacker works on a private chain for the purpose of pulling off a multi-confirmation double spend attack. This almost looks like a network split, except that the apparent hash rate doubles as soon as the attacker announces their longer chain.
Note - Step (3) will take, on average, twice as long as expected (e.g. ~2 hours for 6 confirmations), since the attacker withdraws a majority of hashpower to work on the secret double-spending chain.
@_date: 2018-10-13 03:31:32
Have you considered a 51% attack causing a re-org, and thus reversing blocks that were once rewarded to miners (and thus users who bought them from miners) to the 51% attacker? 
Technically, with enough hashing power, an attacker COULD recreate the blockchain from the second block onward, thus taking every bitcoin and reassigning it to themselves. Obviously the further back this goes, the harder it would be to do, but it is possible.
I acknowledge that this is incredibly unlikely, but you have to be careful when speaking in absolutes such as "there [is]... certainly nothing that is a bigger danger than the denial of service".

Medium of exchange does not equal method of payment. 
When you realise why the concept of a maximum transactions per second for the dollar doesn't make sense, it may help you see why this doesn't make sense for Bitcoin. 
Looking at transactions per second to determine Bitcoins value is (IMO) performing a category error.

If you're interested you can compile a list of addresses via the Electrum console. Step 1,change amount of addresses you want. For example here is 100 addresses:
Then restart Electrum
Then again on console:
listaddresses(True, False, False) 
This firstly produces 100 (or any number you choose) addresses beyond what you've currently used, and secondly shows your addresses in an easy to copy/paste format.
The (True, False, False) refers to (Recieve Addresses, Change Addresses, Labels). Vary them to change, so for your change address list it's: listaddresses(False, True, False). 
Capitals/lower case matters. Let me know if that helps.

"confirming cryptographically that is it correct" IS running a full node. That is how you 'confirm cryptographically'. You cannot otherwise know the balance/existence of your UTXO's without trusting an external third party (or parties) 
Your statement "you can have trustlessness, without your own node" is untrue. Your later assertion "Yes, but you do not have to trust their reply. You can verify it with another node if you want." is more correct; you are trusting others, which is fine, but tell it how it is. 
You are trusting another person that they are relaying the correct information from their node (or multiple people from their respective nodes).

Who decides which random block producer is the chosen one? How are disputes resolved? How are newcomers to determine which chain is the correct chain if there is a split in the chain?

If fees don't return (eventually) to those levels, then the security of the chain will be compromised. Fees are what pay miners as the mining reward gets smaller and smaller.
It is fees which guarantee Bitcoins monetary policy, and therefore scarcity and value. If you are hoping that fees on-chain stay low forever, then you have misunderstood Bitcoin and are going to be a prime target for someone to scam you into buying 'the next bitcoin' with 'transactions per second, low fees, instant, cheap' buzzwords.
Transaction fees are currently about 1% of the mining reward ( and this will eventually be 100% of the reward, so to ensure sufficient hashrate, you better hope for sufficient fees.
You either pay through inflation, or through fees. I want sound money, and as such, acknowledge that people using the blockchain will have to pay for said security through transaction fees.

No, that is a warped government definition of inflation.
Monetary inflation is a sustained increase in the money supply of a country (or currency area). Depending on many factors, especially public expectations, the fundamental state and development of the economy, and the transmission mechanism, it is likely to result in price inflation, which is usually just called "inflation", which is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services.[1][2]

Gold, to me, is insurance. Insurance against debasement, collapse, asset seizure etc. I've been investing since before Bitcoin existed, and as such Gold was the ONLY asset that provided these benefits.
Now Bitcoin exists, with a potential upside 100x of Gold.
But also significantly more risk of catastrophic failure. 5000 years of monetary excellence is not something to be overlooked.
Golds inflation rate (which works to dilute your wealth) is equivalent to a yearly management fee of ~2%, which was cheap before 3rd of January 2009.
Then Bitcoin came along with a new definition of scarcity!
Bitcoin allows someone to aquire a slice of the pie which cannot be diluted.

If someone re-orgs the chain, re-mining the block that produced the mining reward that you eventually ended up with, as far as the blockchain is concerned you will never have received said coin. It will be in the new miners wallet and he can spend it however he wants. 
Generally speaking, a 51% moves forward from a point (so your simplisitic notion that it can't steal coins is true), but a 51% attack can also begin mining at an older block, re-organising the chain, taking coins from owners from that older block forward, and reallocating them to themselves (via the block reward).

The major issue with the Winklevoss ETF was that it would be based solely on one exchange, owned by them, namely Gemini. This left the market maker, issuer and exchange too close to be approved.
The SolidX ETF proposal attempts to address this by proposing an OTC Method for purchasing the Bitcoin that will back the ETF, not just from one exchange, responding to liquidity concerns as well.
Further to that, the SolidX ETF increased the basis unit from 0.01 BTC per share (Winklessvoss) to 25 BTC Per share, addressing concerns from the SEC about the appeal to retail (unsophisticated) investors.

If something is invented that provides the same benefits and assurances that bitcoin does, with significant improvements and no trade-offs, it would require an almost as big a creation/discovery as bitcoin itself.
It might be possible, but in life (generally) there is no 'free lunch'.
If it happens, and supplants bitcoin in market cap/share/psyche, I won't be storing wealth in it OR bitcoin, as it will call into question the longevity of that next project; will it again be replaced by a new and improved system? 
Just as I wouldn't be converting my gold to silver if silver were to surpass golds market cap; instead I would be out of monetary metals entirely, unable to reliably store value there.
With all that said, if such an enormous trade-off free improvement were to be discovered, I suspect it would eventually be forked into the bitcoin protocol.

Block times are Poisson distributed which sometimes causes large variance in block intervals. If several slow blocks happen in a row, it makes these estimates spike down.

It would mean that the ability for a metal (gold) to maintain it's 5,000 year position as a focal point and monetary metal par excellence had been undermined, and that it's replacement could therefore too be overthrown. 
Not only would gold be undermined, but that very same undermining would also affect it's replacement. 
Instead I would start to rebuild/store wealth in other areas (property, index funds, cash, bitcoin), over adopting the new 'monetary metal par excellence'.
It is hard to rebut your comment, as you haven't even formulated an argument.

ALERT ALERT 16,000 Mt Gox coins have moved! ALERT ALERT
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:12:43
You're almost right. However the bitcoin client only checks that NO MORE than the current reward has been awarded. There has been at least one block where (as a proof of concept) less than the full reward was paid. Hence the maximum ever mined was reduced further and may happen again. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:08:27


Can you explain your maths here? 
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:09:52
I'd really appreciate a few links. I thought I had a good take on current events but this slipped by. I said "alert alert" as someone before asked "what are you talking about" the only other time I saw it mentioned so I believe not many must have known.
I would have thought a move that potentially brings 160,000 new bitcoin into the market would have multiple threads and people analysing the exact movements etc to determine exchange / OTC.
I'll stick to the script from now on hodlers... When moon, when lambo...

You're welcome to check my post history. I am as bullish as they come. I see the Mt Gox liquidation as a buying opportunity.
I check the Gox wallets weekly and hadn't seen this change before. Follow Antonopolous, Szabo, Samson Mow, Charlie Lee etc on Twitter and hadn't seen it mentioned.
Looked on reddit r/Bitcoin and saw no mention of it.
Decided it was worth posting in case someone hadn't seen it.

Alternatively, mining will become more about maintaining security in the underlying bitcoin protocol, and profitable to businesses not simply for the mining rewards, but for securing their layer 2 businesses etc.

Because my brain prefers whole numbers (even large whole numbers) compared to decimal prices.
A bottle of milk for 25,000 Satoshis' work fine in my head.
Not having to worry about ever changing to a lower denomiation (re increased BTC price) is a benifit too (with the possible exception of mSat (LN)).
For large transactions, our numbering system does a fine job of naming schemes for appropriate amounts (hundred, thousand, million, billion), adding other words (bitcent) seems to be unnecessary additional mental computation.

Luke, any chance of using knots to demonstrate the ability to use hardware wallets directly with a full node?
I think this would go a long way towards your goal of more users using full nodes. If people could use their hardware wallet directly with Bitcoin core it would be great.
Edit - Even the ability to import an xpub/ypub/zpub would be a great first step for core (I am unsure if it is available in knots?).
@_date: 2018-12-30 23:33:15
Regarding xpub import / export, is that because there isn't an agreed upon standard? Cross compatibly between ledger/electrum/samourai has worked for me (albeit with selecting the correct derivation path).
Would having a standard set out in a BIP help here for further cross compatibility (or is this already set out in BIP32 and I've misunderstood what you mean)?
Is there a better way of creating a watch-only bitcoin core wallet imported from a hardware wallet than by importing each public address individually? (Ie: by importing the extended public key?).

Paraphrased "my main gripe with bitcoin is that it will become too valuable".

My only question would be why you chose 3000 to stay at? If you wrote this 2 months ago would you have said 6k? And if it drops to 1300 will you say we're staying at 1300 for a while?
I agree with your sentiment, but I hope we drop to &lt;2k (1,300 would be a dream) for a while. Starting a run up from the top of a previous high would be clean :)

Hey Pieter, has consideration been given to increasing the default dbcache value? I see a lot of people with good hardware posting about their initial sync taking much longer than it could otherwise have taken as they're not aware of this setting.
Is it possible to have the dbcache default set to (for example) [whichever is the higher of 100 or 1/4 of system RAM]? 
Or a popup option upon first running Core?
"If you are using a low power machine, leave this setting at the default level of 100. If your machine is more powerful, consider increasing this value to xyz".

Hard drive storage space is not the major concern. It is block propagation time and initial block download. Bitcoin works by propagating blocks through nodes on its network; keeping the time this takes low is extremely important.

When lightning has dual channel opening/funding, will you be able to open an evenly balanced channel with a single transaction (with 2 outputs)?
For example, if I want to open a channel to someone, could I take a 100,000sat UTXO, send 50,000sat output to them, and 50,000sat output to myself, to create a 50/50 balanced channel via a single transaction?

By your numbers a 2in 2out transaction at 1sat/vbyte fee would be ~7cents at $20,000.
$20,000 / 100,000,000 x 374 bytes = $0.0748
