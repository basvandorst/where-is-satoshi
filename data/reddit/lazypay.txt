We thought we needed to get across the wider Bitcoin message for people to engage with it at all. Majority of the population in the UK still don't know much about Bitcoin. Obviously we talk about the product quite clearly, and the benefits it brings. No doubt this could be better focused on the product but riding on the coattail of Bitcoin was deliberate because of the audience at the early voting stage. Round 2 pitch is quite different.

Great company, but the popular kid at school was never the successful adult. Bitcoin is still growing up, let’s see how we all mature. Besides, the Guardian recently quoted "(Coinbase) The AOL of Bitcoin". And look what happened there. :)

Thank you! The support of the Bitcoin community is vital to make this possible. If you like what we are trying to do then please vote for us. Should we get through to the next stage, the exposure will help to get Bitcoin itself in front of a wider audience.
