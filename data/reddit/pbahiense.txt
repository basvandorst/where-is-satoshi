I'll get downvoted for this, but damn... I bought this dip.

It's the 'depression' fase... This is what happen right before the next bull run

Where have you been told that anarchy is chaos? 
Anarchy is every activity that you do that government is not present.. In other words, most part of them

I'm wondering if THIS is not the exactly moment where everyone has the chance to buy altcoins and will regreet not doing it later.
Ps: i'm all in in bitcoin

I don't know how much you invested, but i put a good quantity in the market (like a 1 year income).
I'm down 50% and i'm sure that it will return even more than what i invested.
Crypto is THE THING invented in this century (last one was the internet).
HAYEK told once that "Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends".
Crypto just breaks all of the "control" part!
It's like a path for the people's freedom from the government, banks and institutions!!
This is one of the biggest thinks EVER!
There's absolutly no reason to be worry.
Just enjoy.

Selling the dip... Good job! Buy the top in a few weeks
@_date: 2018-08-06 16:15:31
Better buy the dipping of the third dip inside the dip

If it explains better, im an anarcho capitalist.
Its one of the arms of libertarianism.
 That confusion is because in Brazil we just call libertarian those who defend freedom abd property rights at its ultimate consequences.
Syria is not an anarcho capitalism simply because it doesnt respect property rights. 
But i dont wanna to discuss it by here. It can take hours typing xD

SEC's postpone is already priced. Selling now is crazy
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:17:27
Reserch for libertarianism... There is a lot of ethical, moral and pragmatic arguments.
I'll not explain here because it takes time.
Have a good night

If you think so... Im not changing your mind
@_date: 2018-08-06 16:13:21
Do Btc stuff

Bitcoin's domince has grow without new money enter the market. In other words, money has been transfered from alts to Bitcoin. 
Imo the next movement is new money entering the market pumping bitcoin and growing even more its dominance.
 Then this new money will be transfered to Alts pumping then as fast as january 2018.
This happened before and its goong to happen now.
Smart decision is to be in bitcoin and wait for the new money. But idk
Those who still are in alts must stay after all this bleeding because is too risky leave now and lose a possible reversion on this trend.
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:09:51
Annnd... You were right rsrs
But i still think selling now is not an option
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:45:59
Man calm down.
 I think you will regret more selling now than not doing it.
Since you are in, enjoy your position. You are between the 0,5% early adopters!

Look at how amazing is crypto.
People somehow will realize that your money in a bank is not yours indeed.
If you think this kind of independence will be ignored by the world, maybe you should think about it again.
@_date: 2018-08-30 20:01:17
The oposite is true
@_date: 2018-08-06 16:52:50
Sometime the money will start to arrive in the market and it will enter by bitcoin.
What im saying is that no matter the type of money is entering (institutional or retail money). It will be exposed to the altcoins and the risk lovers will join altcoins.
This is the reason of the altcoin's pump after bitcoin's.
Maybe just the biggest ones will do that movent, because of this 'burn' you sid, but imo its a fact that they will pump.
Besides, the money you need to double an altcoin is much less than you need to double bitcoin

No... We will stay just like we are today, but with no authority to rule your life and steal your property.
Feudalism in ireland was just an example of a society based in this principles.
@_date: 2018-08-09 02:20:25
Pré-capitalist world (feudal) where several regions didn't used to have a burocratic authority (like ireland and iceland).
In this societys, rules were done by natural market process, behaviors and traditions... Not by a burocratic politician that take taxes against your will and says what you have to do.
