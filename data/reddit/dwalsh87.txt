It says received 5 hours ago but its actually been 32 hours. Now that I think about it, i dont think the fee was high so it does make more sense

Cool. Don't mind waiting. Thanks!

Are you being sincere? Thanks if so

Isn't there only a set amount of it in existence?

I put it in quotes because is money really ever extra.

Yes, I am sending to a middle man wallet before I put it into coinbase. And no, it's not the above wallet �� thanks

Cool. That looks very neat but will have to see if the fees are worth it. Thank you for the info!!!

Hmm. I do have a coinbase account. Not sure where GDAX is? Just scanned through my coinbase account. My bitcoin ignorance is showing.

Looks great. Just have no idea if we even have one of those around here (myrtle beach , sc)

I never really thought of that because the whole bitcoin thing is intimidating and confusing to me honestly. I've only used it because sometimes on this site, my card gets declined so i would buy bitcoin and deposit that way. I'll keep an open mind though.

Thank you

Okay. Thanks! I'll have to play around with it at the office tomorrow. Im curious as to how much I would clear after fees. Say I deposited $300 USD of bitcoin to GDAX, by the time I sold and transferred to my bank account, what are the fees like? I know I'm asking a lot, but I'm curious as this bitcoin world is uncharted territory for me!
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:40:23
I think I'm starting to understand. I send the bitcoin to my coinbase wallet and then do I have to send from coinbase to GDAX so I'm able to transfer to my bank account? Or is it already tied in together?
