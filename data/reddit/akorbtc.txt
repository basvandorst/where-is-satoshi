for a small blocker like me, the eth mess is the best thing that could have happened to btc - in that it illustrates the possible fallout of a contentious hf.  the latest meeting taking place between miners and core is a meeting of like minds.  the only thing being discussed is how the foregone conclusion of no hf is presented to the community.  just mho....  thoughts?

get over yourself, mr. serious.  ftr, i think his delivery was perfect for a lead-in/intro but it lasted the whole flick.  too much.  i couldn't relax, too much anticipatory mojo....  all in all, it was damn good, i just wish dude would have mellowed out a bit and let the content make the impact instead of the non-stop james earl jones impression.  it was borderline SNL/onion ridic.  
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:21:49
Haha!  Classic.  Now that is progress I can get behind.  Actually, I'd like them to hard fork that decision and rollback the meeting to when they held that particular vote.  moral hazard and such....

i think most of your confusion and your questions boil down to calculated semantics and intentional vagueness.  i support utilizing these two obfuscational techniques as i believe they are being used to protect/support bitcoin.  however, they are confusing to people and contributing to some strife within the community.  tip   take a break from reddit as often as possible.  take it from me, this place is an echo chamber/false narrative/confirmation bias hell.  i wish i took this advice more often....

nobody that loses coin to an exchange hack equates their exchange account with a real bitcoin wallet.  they are trading.  they are taking a calculated risk to be able to participate in the market place.  crypto traders are savvy to the ways of the bitcoin, stop making them out to be mom and pop buy and holders.  i'm not blaming the victim here, just calling it like i see it.  i am sincerely sorry for all that lost funds in this hack.

all the obvious/less sexy stuff that we like to glaze over, that is actually, and always has been/will be, the true drivers of price.  21M coin limit, halving schedule and rising public interest (FOMO), possibly a couple others....  don't get me wrong, the ETF is exciting, i have my popcorn ready too but i think Vinny's -150/+1000 call is pretty spot on.  however, i don't agree with his 15% probability of acceptance number (me thinks its a dead heat 50/50).  sorry to be so vague and mildly dismissive but i think you're assigning too much of this last six months to the ETF.  we see......  best to you.

fair point.  i should have said "pls sell me on a btc pos algo that can rival the historical and futuristic immutability and security of btc's current pow algo".  what would this pos algo look like that can provide the same level of immutability and security that btc's blockchain currently enjoys? i realize this is a slightly unfair challenge and that your OP is more theoretical but that is where my questions/concerns lie.

interesting thought re: intentionally changing language....  my retort would actually be the words google and yahoo.  when i first heard there were "real" companies opening up with those two words as their names, i instinctually dismissed them both.  not sure exactly why but i know it had to do with something deep seated and ingrained re: language/words.  you know the rest the story.  not sure if that is really an argument against your point but it is what comes to mind.  


prolly not...  especially since i see killer app as store of value/reserve currency and not digital cash/medium of exchange (of course btc is still both of these but you know what i mean...).  all that said, i run into this a lot when preaching the good word....

I'm guessing the reason there isn't much movement is because cold storage is just as good if not better than a hw...  or the difference is so negligible that it isn't worth transmitting coins to the network that are meant for long term savings anyway.  the bulk of the hw users out there are newer hodlers, i believe.  not intended to be derogatory just conjecture....  best to use valuable dev time on stuff that moves the needle....

for years, i've felt that we need to revisit the denomination discussion.  my reasoning is different than op's but i think its important to keep asking the question - is our terminology working against the goal of adoption (even if just fractionally/barely)?  my concern revolves around post-moon valuations and noobie perception.

i realize you're just trolling but your post brings up a valid point. i would counter by saying "what is the harm in making it an option?". we aren't advocating for going to only accepting bitcoin, we just feel that it is a logical addition to the basket of other payment options used with airbnb. is that so wrong? maybe only 5% (prob a lot less) will use it, but having the option would be nice. btw, consider buying some bitcoin when the price drops a bit, its pretty interesting tech.... even a smarty pants like you might learn something too.

thank you for the measured response.  i appreciate your civility and earnest engagement.  however, i disagree with your characterization that btc is akin to central banking because of core's stance re: block size.  in fact, i think raising the block size to advantage companies that rely on faster throughput, stupid cheap fees and micro txs, to the detriment of security and decentralization, ffs, is akin to the worst things about crony capitalism.  many a congressman has had his pockets stuffed to tweak the rules of an economic system to benefit the business class.  i'm proud of core's indifference to the whims of casino owners like roger ver.  read what i originally posted again.  bitcoin is on a path that is veering away from some business models and veering towards others.  i object to your urge to steer it towards your flavor of the month btc start up.  succeed by reading the environment and reacting in a way that is beneficial to your cause.  fail to do this and suffer the defeat you deserve.  re: your mention of side channels....  ok, whatever.  no segwit = an inferior LN.  thanks again for your thoughts.

initially, to help the network and to participate in maintaining the highest level of decentralization possible.  after going through the process i found out there's security related benefits to running a node.  avoiding the need to use an SPV wallet or acquiring blockchain info from a server/third party is a huge benefit.  others around here are more knowledgeable on this stuff but, that's why....

i just posted the following in the same thread on the other sub.  not looking for up votes, just wanted to share an observation i had:
i have to mention the needham conference call that roger (for some unknown reason) was invited to participate in. i read the whole thing and recommend it to all bitcoiners. my observation: when roger has a seat at the grown up table, he stfu and lets the adults speak. this was a prime opportunity to grind his favorite axe to some of the biggest names in the ecosystem. what did he do? he said barely anything, made no waves and thanked dr. back for allowing him to hang out with the cool kids. if he had any balls, or at least any true conviction, he would have piped up and really tried to move a needle. nope, crickets. this was very telling for me. bottom line: when in the company of his fanboys, sock puppets and teenaged followers, he is a lion-hearted trail blazer. when allowed to swim outside of his gene pool, he politely lowers his head and says "thank you, sir. may i have another?" 
@_date: 2016-11-29 16:57:28
been thinking this for years.  i think it is a psychological factor that bubble-dwelling bitcoiners are missing.  its almost as if they (we) understand the dynamic but have no interest in coalescing with it.  i've picked up on a weird "if noobs don't get it....  fuck 'em"-vibe.....  its too bad cause i think OP is right on this one.  lastly, i've run into this problem (noob thinks 1 btc is way too expensive) when conversing with ppl, its real.  yes, we know - explain that one doesn't have to buy a whole coin/btc are divisible - i get it.  its still a real phenomenon.

i disagree with you.  if new ppl don't adopt bitcoin, for their own reasons, i see no reason to tweak it in a way that makes it more attractive to those ppl that aren't involved - if you can't see the beauty, move on to something that does attract you.  also, i don't see why new adopters can't get involved.  is it fees?  pls don't tell me its the difference between a couple pennies.  that is disingenuous.  i think ppl that believe how you do are more beholden to the payment processors and exchanges and not the average joe savers/hodlers.  in other words, you are a shill and you think you are an altruistic saint.  digital gold, period.  you wanna buy your coffee with crypto?  adopt an alt, fork btc or use fiat.  in all sincerity, i apologize for the crude language and bad energy.  i won't promise it won't happen again, but I'm never happy when it does.  best to you.

I don't see where he says this possible move has to be up.  We could get a $200 cratering and he's was technically still correct.  I do like the added drama of a smart/experienced person chiming in.  Orville redenbaucher.

wow.  project much?
i'm no GA fan, but.... sheesh.

hahaha!  op, this dude is trolling you.  period.  
@_date: 2016-10-07 19:40:43
thank you, kind sir.  glad you liked.
@_date: 2016-10-10 18:21:16
how's that hash rate figure looking now?  sub 5% currently.  sorry to say i told you so, but....
@_date: 2016-10-24 15:18:27
totally agree.  as predicted.  i've been watching this unfold for a couple months.  I'm not sad about it.
@_date: 2016-10-11 16:52:22
full disclosure - i fell for this about a month ago and lost some bits.  don't be like me.  if it seems too good to be true....
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:17:53
and look at that - 2 week old sock account.  knucklehead...
@_date: 2016-10-10 13:54:22
gotta love numbers....  show me a number and i can frame it in a conversation that supports any narrative i want to support.  this is fud.  period.  carry on.
@_date: 2016-10-11 17:14:14
sorry.  probably should go in another sub but i got giddy about the HUGE /s price rise and all the charts being posted...  look at me, look at me, i have ideas too...  
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:10:48
the 2 more halvings theory?  
@_date: 2016-10-11 22:21:28
i like this.  not sure if it applies to all of us, but i like it.  btw, it applies to me.  so you're telling me an emotional, indecisive, panic seller should sit rallies out?  noted.
@_date: 2016-10-29 03:59:02


we are so far ahead its barely worth discussing.  your concern trolling is insulting and annoying.  the fact that you are wrong is only part of why i wish you'd stfu.  
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:16:10
you must be new here.  actually, you must be new everywhere.  the intrinsic value argument is dead.  you may not like that, because you're new and you think you're the only one who understands IV, but, nevertheless, its dead.  welcome to bitcoin.  actually, welcome to money, noob.
@_date: 2017-07-20 03:16:30
Iirc ur wallet.dat file HAS to be named wallet.dat when it is imported into the app data file.  Adding the 2 May screw it up.  Of course, you'll need the wallet to sync too....  Maybe the forum experts will confirm whether I'm right or wrong....  Good luck and pls keep on this thread as I think others could benefit from it. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:06:33


couldn't we argue this is the intrinsic part?  


apparently, this is a photo that can't be photoshopped, duplicated or stolen.  i needs me one of these immutable, censorship resistant, cryptographically protected photos....


riiiight, because the bond market is completely transparent, unmanipulated and not under the influence of centralized institutions.  maybe we should start calling it the bond blockchain...
i hear you and i understand your position.  how?  cause its the go-to for all fiat believers.  but muh .gov says its the real money....
best to you.  sincerely.

roger doesn't have friends, he has biz associates and groupies.  when you exude condescending assholishness like this fucktard, your friends have likely long left you.  and about that polo.....
@_date: 2016-10-07 22:18:17
thanks so much for the reply.  


do Bitseed nodes do these things?
  
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:38:13
Stupid polo.  Stupid pollo. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:36:33
Contact polo support, they can reverse the tx and refund ur BTC.  Will they?  Idk, but they can. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:06:32
Yes, considering this is ur only choice.  I made this same mistake and they were able to fix it.  Unfortunately my episode happened during  a much different era.  So much going on these days, hard to say how they will react.  I'd be patient and expect a somewhat lengthy wait for a resolution. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 15:11:19
i tend to agree.  not sure about 500s but i do agree we will fall back a good chunk.  me thinks 615 or so.  interesting to watch the current resistance/support levels currently being tested.  thanks for comment.
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:13:08
So if u lose a OD, and someone finds it, can they break the seal and spend the coins?  Can OD be encrypted?  Thx. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 03:50:57
thx. i'm looking seriously at the "medium" sized version, 1 TB i think.  site says should be good "enough for 5+ years with full backup at current block size limit".  thx for info.

r/btc = the zerohedge of bitcoin.  i love it.  instant classic.
@_date: 2016-07-12 13:44:38
a 13 yo w/ 5000 r/bitcoin karma?  jesus, have i been flaming and trolling a bunch of middle schoolers this whole time?  bearish.
@_date: 2016-07-29 06:31:34
yikes.  left no buenos.  bearish.
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:34:02
increased cost due to dealing with needy/annoying/econo-ignorant bitcoiners could be risky to your bottom line - too many resources allocated to one customer class (likely the smallest of the three) could be a financial burden.  just guessing here cause it isn't obvious from the article....
@_date: 2016-07-07 21:29:24
So which is it?  Interesting developments or a pump?  It can't be both yet you seem to imply it is.  Or isn't....  Actually, I don't know what you are trying to convey....  Do you?
@_date: 2016-07-07 21:36:50
ahhh, that's better.  ty.
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:22:43
Your guess is as good as mine....  maybe today, maybe never.  I'd be persistent, but not overbearing, and polite.  Remember: u fucked up.  Now u are relying on the goodness of a tech support person to help u.  They provide a disclaimer/warning when they show ur receiving addies so they don't HAVE  to help u.  I've always had good interactions with them and sincerely believe they will help u too.  Be patient (ur only choice). 
@_date: 2016-07-29 06:29:32
oh crap, i own a black cat.  that makes 3.  bullish.
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:56:56
this guy gets it.  great comment.  hall of fame level.  thanks.
@_date: 2016-07-29 05:45:13
total shit post, i admit.  couldn't help it....  the sideways price boredom made me do it.
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:36:27
