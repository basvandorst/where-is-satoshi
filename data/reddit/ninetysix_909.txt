you are absolutely right.  Crypto has attracted the most vile of criminal now... the underbelly of the financial world has pushed the price here and is now playing volleyball with it and will eventually take what they want and leave the government to clean up the mess... they saw their hole and made their moves...

I think the finance people that take advantage of situational loopholes are pretty vile... I dont blame them and they dont hide their intentions but it does not sit well with me.

Yes... Just like the first banks in America were supposed to rid the colonies of the evils of the Empire...  And how Uber was not going to be just another cab... And airbnb could just let anyone stay with anyone.  People seem to love the idea of governing themselves and yet when shit hits the fan look to big government to save them... Crypto was not created for profit... It was created to help people

The fact that people are just realizing this is possible is alarming when you consider the confusion the majority of people could have if BTC took a 99% dive and a bunch of random rich people magically got richer

I also saw Some odd activity last night... When the Bitcoin Cash was added to the site it said I had a balance for about five minutes then the app froze and "reset"
Seemed very odd
