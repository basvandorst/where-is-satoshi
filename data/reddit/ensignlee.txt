Refute the piece then. That's a lazy counterargument, especially considering that the NYT is one of the most respected newspapers in the world.
Go to politifact and show me that Obama has as many pants on fire lies to his name as Trump.
We'll wait here. If you don't respond, we'll know you came up empty.

Possibly the fed government shutdown because Trump is an idiot and refused to sign anything without enough funding for his stupid wall, despite the fact that the bipartisan solution included funding for increased border security.

No, there wasn't a huge amount of research regarding it. It just "was".
The main resistance point against increasing it now is that it is not backwards compatible, and so you would leave a lot of people and businesses with screwed up wallets if you implemented it.

Blatantly not true when you add up the confirmed lies. Trump lies 5-6x as much by the numbers.

"8.1.2      Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
In 2017, Bitcoin users adopted an improvement proposal for Segregated Witness (known as SegWit, where transactions are split into two segments: transactional data, and signature data) through a soft fork. SegWit made it possible to store transactional data in a more compact form while maintaining backwards compatibility.  However, a group of users had different opinions on how Bitcoin should evolve – and developed a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain titled Bitcoin Cash. Rather than implementing the SegWit changes, the developers of Bitcoin Cash decided to simply increase the blocksize. When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash."
Got a response! Looks like they'll be revising it!

To be fair, if hash rates drops SIGNIFICANTLY, it won't be just for a week or two. It might be for a month or two. Or, if it's a huge enough drop, a YEAR or two.

They can do NONE of those things you mentioned. WTF are you talking about?
We literally just had a huge hard fork last year because we couldn't come to concensus on how to scale, and you think that Core can ban addresses (has never happened), unlimit the number of bitcoins (has never happened)?
What weird place do you learn these things?
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:39:31
Your title implies that they EACH hold 21,000 btc.
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:05:48
I concur, but that doesn't change the fact that it's somehow a billion dollar industry, so yes, it might be reasonable to assume what Essexal said

Do it from gdax and you should be good to go. I think someone earlier in this very thread mentioned that he got his USD the very next day, despite gdax covering their asses and saying it would take 4-5 business days.

and bcash doesn't have segwit. There's that.
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:45:24
If you have a coinbase account, you have a gdax account.
Market maker orders there are free, and market taker orders are only .25% . Much cheaper than coinbase sales.

@_date: 2018-01-25 00:38:39
There is like a 0% chance they understood the signed message, though props to you for that.
All that they really probably want from you is a statement from gdax saying it's your account, and when it was created.
They are just covering their asses in case it's not you on the other end of these transfers from their end.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:53:33
According to this, median transaction size is currently only $6, which, while obviously not ideal, is still a ton less than $10-$40.

What you say in jest is true. Politifact is NOT biased towards a party. They are there to point out political lies.
Just because your dear leader likes to lie a lot and politifact points that out does not make them biased. It means Trump lies a lot, a lot more than Obama did at the very least (which was the orig topic)

Thanks for posting. People are more inclined to post complaints, and even though coinbase is not my favorite exchange atm because of their non-segwit hijinks, accusing them of tying up funds for most people is currently false imo.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:05:04
The threshold for mandatory reporting of transactions is $10k. If you wanted to say, deposit $33k, that would be a reportable transaction.
Some people, in order to avoid reporting, would make deposits of $8k, $8k, $8k, and $9k to try and hopefully not get reported. That is called structuring and it is actually a crime.
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:09:29

I think wire transfers would get the money to coinbase more quickly, but it does cost money.
Also, locking the current market price is a thing you can do with coinbase directly, but they do charge in essence 1.5-2% for it.

Gdax is an exchange. The people willing to buy and sell coins on that exchange currently are trading higher than elsewhere, presumably because there are more dollars chasing fewer coins there.

Wait, if I'm reading that correctly, the CMEs are physical futures? Bitcoins have to be delivered at the end of them? They're not cash settled?

Bitcoin and crypto is still too speculative and too much like "magic internet money" to be a flight to safety asset.
In another recession, nobody is going to sell their risky assets (equities) for EVEN MORE RISKY ASSETS (crypto). I would expect to endure losses at magnitudes worse than what the equity markets would see.
Like 50% at minimum, 95 to 99% at worst.

B) If someone hacks your account, wouldn't you be happy that the thief could only make off with $10k of your btc instead of ALL of it?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:33:14
This is honestly a fantastic idea. No one confuses 1000 and 100, but some people will surely confuse .001 or .0001 . Imagine paying 10x what you need to for something by accident and having no way to recall said payment. THAT will be a large hurdle to mainstream adoption.
And on top of that, you would not believe how many people I've heard say they're going to buy ethereum because "it's cheaper", because they don't give a shit there are already 100M ether out there and only 16M btc. The price is a psychological anchor.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:06:22

Well, imo, at least. It has no purpose.
If I wanted a coin with lower fees that is similar to bitcoin, I'd buy litecoin. It has every advantage that BCH has, and more (an actual dev team, segwit, non-toxic community heads)

You're pretty great, yo.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:26:55
Oh right, good call.
Let me know if you go into this rabbit hole further. How does an individual investor trade on the CME for instance? I'd be interested in running this experiment with you.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:02:25
Bitcoin or USD withdrawals?
My USD ACHs to my bank accounts were usually there in 1-2 business days, faster than their estimate of 3-5.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:07:42
Okay, so provide some reasoning then to back up your statement besides "you don't know what you're talking about."
Let's pretend that you're the bank. You see some guy who's only ever had a total account balance of maybe $25k, $30k, suddenly deposit $50k, but only in increments of $8k-$9k. What do YOU think is going on?
Tell me why your first assumption isn't "That guy is structuring". No random risk officer at a bank is going to first look up what coinbase is, then figure out that the normal transaction limit is $10k, vs just saying "yeah, we should report that guy and let the government handle it."
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:35:08

ETH fell from a high of $850 to $500, a fall of 41%. It's also already kin
Litecoin fell from a high of $400 to $240 of 40%
To be "super depressed", shouldn't they have fallen MORE than bitcoin did %-wise?

One thing to keep in mind is that the future at CME or CBOE is a cash settle, so you won't actually get said bitcoin at the end of it. You'll just have the money, which you'll have to then wire to an exchange, bearing that time risk, and then you'll have to re-buy your btc there.
That being said, what you described does sound like an attractive option.

@_date: 2017-12-07 20:24:00
To be fair, that was kind of an extreme real world scenario. And the $9k -&gt; $9 thing is kind of a worst case OH SHIT scenario as well in term of liquidity.
But that's what stop orders do. Wanted to make sure you knew what you were getting into.
Some places will let you place stop LIMIT orders instead of stop MARKET orders. But the problem is that there's no guarantee they fill.
If you place a $9k stop LIMIT order at $9k, the price could keep on falling to $8k or $7k or $5k, and your stop LIMIT order would still be sitting there at $9k, never filled. You would never have sold your coin and you'd still be long, even with the price at say, $5k.

@_date: 2017-12-07 19:59:52
I assume you mean if it hits $9k from where it is now. In that case, that is a stop order, probably a stop MARKET order, which means you will take any price under $9k as long as it is there.
Be careful of those. What you're saying is "Okay, if it hits $9k, I want to immediately sell x btc, for whatever price." You might get filled at $8,999 . Or you might get filled at $8.99 and sell your bitcoin for $9. Depends on the order book at the time.

I don't see an option for a stop limit vs a stop market, no.
Keep in mind if you did find a way to do a stop limit, there is no guarantee your position would be filled, so you could be left holding bags on the way down, kind of defeating the purpose of a stop order.
tl;dr are you SURE you want to do a stop order? They can cut you up, whether they are stop MARKET orders or stop LIMIT orders.

@_date: 2017-12-07 19:15:27
It's called a limit order. And the cons are that it blows way past your price, or conversely, that it never hits your price.
Like if I put one out there at $24k now, it might never get filled. Or it might get filled on the way up to $25k and I'll miss out on $1k. Those are the risks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:52:15
If you're talking about the first time, yeah, I get it. But the second time we got to 19.5k, it wasn't a false number. Coinbase wasn't having issues then?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:00:50
You will be selling half your coins, with proceeds of $10 and a cost basis of $5.
So you would owe taxes on the difference on that. $10-5 = $5. From there, it's your marginal tax bracket * $5 = your taxes owed.

They added BCH as a new coin. Then they crashed their own servers.
Some (imo valid) speculation about this all being another of Ver and BCH's attacks on Bitcoin, since this coincided with the difficulty adjustment, the CNBC interview, and the large news about Ver's business associate "giving up on bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:10:16
Because your stop market order basically said "Hey, if the price hits $9k, I want to immediately sell x btc". That's what it does.
It can't automatically sell for $9,000 if there is nobody there willing to BUY for $9k. Who are you going to trade with?
That's how we fell IMMEDIATELY from $10k to $9k just a couple weeks ago. There weren't enough orders in between $10k and $9k, but there were some at $9k, so people sold at $9k, only to see the next trades happen a couple minutes later back at $10k.

They're not super depressed though?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:36:48
One piece of advice. You left "worrying about taxes" for the end.
Worry about them FIRST.
Assuming that you're earning $100k for hte year (just for easy math), you will only be able to sell about $100k more (to $200k) at the long term capital gains rate of 15%. The next $200k (to $400k) will be at 15% + 3.8% Net Investment Income tax. And then everything past that will be be at 23.8% (20% + 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax).
You will be able to mitigate that quite a bit by spreading your sale across two years. So sell half this year, and then sell half in January, if you're really going to just up and sell it all.
That will help save you taxes on about $400k, since that amount will be put into next year's taxes instead of this year's.
Good luck. Let me know if you have any questions. But you absolutely should NOT worry about taxes last. The last thing you want to do is do all that stuff that you said you wanted to do, and then figure out that you owe the IRS $200k-ish.
P.S. As someone else pointed out, don't forget to cash our your bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, etc as well.

To help give you some insight, many of us that are HODL now are the idiots that sold earlier. We're scarred from our previous decisions.
For instance, I sold 200 coins at $10 when that was the peak, thinking I'd easily be able to buy again at $8.
...still have my limit order set at $8. Or at least, I would. If Mt Gox was still a thing. :/
Experiences like that scar you.
I didn't sell again until we hit $1k, $2.4k (when Mt Gox bankruptcy was solvent), $4.7k, and $10k. And now I regret all of THOSE sales too! I could have been retired man...
If only I'd just hodled...

But this would also be true if you got paid in Euros, and you lived here in the US. You would hold your euros, and if they appreciated (relative to the dollar), then you would pay income tax on that appreciation when you spend it if you found a store willing to transact in Euros instead of USD.
Do you see the difference then between the sales tax you're talking about and income tax?
You are paying tax on the (speculation) income of holding Euros in this example, just like you would pay tax on the (speculation) income of holding BTC.

That's not the way income tax works though. They tax you for income you make while in their borders basically or while you are a citizen.
(1) A Chinese citizen comes to the US. He makes income in the US. He owes US Taxes, not because he got paid in USD, but because he got paid while in US borders. He could get paid in Yuan and the result would still be the same.
(2) I, a US citizen, go work in say...Australia. Since I am a citizen, I still owe US Taxes on money I make there, even if I get paid in Australian currency.
Neither of these situations is different from bitcoin. The main difference here would be that you either mined your bitcoins, or got paid them for doing things. If you mined them, the act of turning them from bitcoins into something else is a taxable event. If you got paid them for doing things, getting paid is a taxable event.
The point I'm trying to get across here is that the tax doesn't follow the currency - it follows the *income* generator, namely you.

"Safe and solid hedge fund?" What?
Hedge funds are the opposite of safe and solid. They try to get more returns by getting into more risk.
Hedge funds are not fancier (and more expensive!) index funds.

Sorry, the boat has long since left for PC mining. When we say you won't get much, we mean even if you were in a pool, you might end up with $.02 after a month's worth of mining, and that's BEFORE you factor in all the electricity that you've used.

How would no raises be the fault of the federal reserve? They set monetary policy, which can make prices rise, but it would not also have the effect of stifling raises.

Moreover, you still haven't proven your point. Show me they are lagging behind their peers. You can't just make statements and will them true.

B) Leave it at coinbase until you've done A

**I** am the lazy one for not looking for evidence of **YOUR** assertions?
Your rationales are mind boggling. How would you feel if I told YOU to find evidence of something **I** was saying? You'd happily go do it?
And your article again only talks in raw numbers. And is for one month, after one specific incident. You were supposed to show a general trend of CNN ratings falling behind their peers.
So, at least this one was on topic. Partial credit, but your assertion is still not yet a credible assertion.
ESPECIALLY since you had to change your original argument in the first place.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:27:42

And where did I say that?
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:21:48
Something funny to share from a news organization, about how he has accomplished the least of any president in the last several decades.
So yes, it does compose an argument. You'd have to actually *read* the article to see the arguments, but I think we both know that's too much to expect from you.

"it's an editorial, not an article."
You are literally getting your news and arguments from editorials. That should have ended this right here. I'm not linking you to someone's blog, which is basically what you're doing. Just because some news is slightly slanted doesn't mean you should be getting your news from editorials. That's lunacy. That's the equivalent of saying "Oh, well sometimes people lie, so that's why I only trust my cult leader to tell me what to do. It's all the same. Everyone's the same, so I may as well just listen to my cult leader."
You also did not address the renewables jobs that would be lost because of withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords.
And you didn't even bother with a 2 second google search of "How many permanent jobs will the Keystone pipeline create?" to address my 32 jobs comment. You just said it was wrong.
Well, I was a *little* wrong. 35, not 32. 50 at the most optimistic. And that's from THE STATE DEPARTMENT. lol at one of his biggest achievements being at most 50 permanent jobs. The ones for construction will only last a couple of years.
And lol again at you saying that pulling out of something is progress. He has so few achievements, you're grasping at straws.
His entire presidency is one giant dumpster fire. More than that, it's one giant HYPOCRITICAL dumpster fire. Look no further than for glaring examples of his hypocrisy. "But her emails" "lock her up" . lol. It's like everything he accused others of doing he had done himself.
With a majority in both legislative houses, he should have steamrolled his agenda, and yet he has accomplished almost nothing legislative-wise. Obama, on the other hand, passed the biggest nationwide health care bill possible.
Trump? He's relying on "I'll let what this other guy built fail, because it's too hard to create something on my own. And then I'll call it a success."
Idiots, both him and you.

No, we live off seeing his inability to function well as a President. He has the easiest road ever for a President.

CNN, along with several other news sources. Or you know, I can just use my brain and see exactly what he's saying and doing.
And lol, it's his lack of salesmanship that got Republicans to vote against his repeal and replace. What happened to his plan? The super great one that was promised? Why did he have to rely on Mitch McConnell to craft one from scratch.
Because he sucks at governing.

@_date: 2017-08-06 12:20:40
Well, first off, it's an editorial, not an article. It's important that you recognize the difference between news and editorials. That's why Fox News got so off the rails in the first place, presenting editorials as news.
But okay, let's talk about the article.
lol at "What else? Well, Trump pulled out of the Paris climate change deal, which as we noted in this space is a yuuuge win for the economy." which is patently false and super stupid. We, along with Syria and Nicaragua, are the only 3 countries to not participate. Way to go us. Also, pulling out of it will cost more renewables jobs than it will save, so so much for the argument of this "saving jobs".
and then it goes on to say that Keystone XL is a huge win. That pipeline that will create a whopping what, 32 permanent jobs? Hooray /s
That's what this guy is hanging his hat on? lol.
You're right about one thing. I am super intolerant of stupidity, which you reek of.
But you're wrong about yet another thing; I don't own skinny jeans, or a mask. I do have a bike lock, for my bike.
I'm a gun toting Texan who isn't even *that* liberal. The definition of "center" moved so far right, apparently I'm "liberal" now. Me, the free market loving, high income, gun toting Texan. Because of idiots like you.

Oh, so *I* have to find the details to back YOUR assertion? Is that what you just said?
No, that's not how you prove your argument right. You had a hypothesis/argument. You then failed to back it with any evidence, and told me to find evidence for you.
Absent any evidence, your claim is invalid. Your claim literally has the same amount of evidence as "Clouds are made of cotton candy."
That's where we are. Ridiculous.

I still actually really like gdax. They gave plenty of warning to get your coins off of there if you wanted BCH, and more importantly, THEY PAID OUT THE LOSERS OF THAT FLASH CRASH FROM THEIR OWN FUNDS.
They didn't rollback the trades; the winners kept their winnings. Gdax just made the losers whole. That is AMAZING.
Plus, their interface is easy to use, and their fees are .1% to take, free to make. .1% is so small to basically be negligible.
I'm sure I've cost them more in bitcoin transaction fees moving btc in/out than they've made off of me in commissions tbh.
That all being said, as a direct answer to your question, why not use gemini?

Those decisions have cost me about $1M this year, AND I owe a gigantic fucking tax bill. :/
Gamble with what you're comfortable gambling. If it's making you sweat too much, sell to the point where you're not.
I would note, however, ask yourself what you're going to do with the money afterwards, because that's a problem I didn't give enough thought to. Are you going to invest it into equities? Leave it in a high yield savings account?

Or I can ride this to Mars apparently, since I'm already underwater on the sell I put out there yest at 9989. O.o In that case, I should only sell very tiny bits, enough to be in the 0% tax bracket for long term gains and ride the rest out.

You're basically saying that absent a PERFECT solution, you'd rather have NO solution, for MAXIMUM fuckery.
We both agree that a truly free market would be best, but I see that as an impossibility, and you're saying "That perfect solution, or IT DOESN'T EVEN FUCKING MATTER." , whereas I'm saying that it very much does matter.
You can be for mostly free market stuff, but recognize that not EVERYTHING the government does is bad. For instance, I don't think free market police are a good idea. Or free market roads. Or a free market military.

@_date: 2017-11-22 15:27:25
And also, I get the argument of "just because they CAN screw with customers doesn't mean that they WILL" screw with customers.
And to that, I present a sample of the actions by many ISPs that caused net neutrality protections in the first place:
(credit to ):
MADISON RIVER: In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.
COMCAST: In 2005, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.
TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.
AT&amp;T: From 2007–2009, AT&amp;T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&amp;T when it came on the scene in 2009.
WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.
MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.
PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites.
AT&amp;T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.
EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace.
VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.
AT&amp;T: In 2012, AT&amp;T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&amp;T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&amp;T’s own products.
VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.

Because if you remove the Title II protections, then SOMETHING can happen.
Here's an analogy. Imagine a storyworld, where no one had ever hurt another. That's the internet before 2015.
Then, people realized, hey, these sword things. I can use them to hurt other people, and or use the threat of hurting other people to force them to give me stuff.
So the governing authority (the FCC in this analogy) created Title II, which said "Hey, no using swords to hurt people."
Some of the people with swords (the ISPs in this analogy said) said "Hey, nobody ever hurt anyone before. We don't need those stupid rules to tell us not to. Just repeal those stupid rules. We promise we won't hurt people "
That's basically what you're saying now.
Just because nobody thought to do something BEFORE the FCC made it illegal doesn't mean that those protections were unnecessary.
They are WHOLLY NECESSARY.
**Those Title II protections continued the status quo from before 2015. REMOVING them puts us in a dangerous new area.**

AT&amp;T: From 2007–2009, AT&amp;T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&amp;T when it came on the scene in 2009.
WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.
MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.
PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites.
AT&amp;T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.
EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace.
VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.
AT&amp;T: In 2012, AT&amp;T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&amp;T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&amp;T’s own products.
VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.

When the seller transfers bitcoins from his localbitcoins account to yours, there isn't an undo button. Any transaction you do on localbitcoins should happen in real bitcoins.
It's not craigslist fortunately.

Just a heads up that if he sells half (about $1M) worth, he shoudl set aside 23.8% , since that will be where most of his money will be taxed at (long term gains of 20% + 3.8% tax after $200k)

@_date: 2017-11-30 04:33:58
There isn't any.
Quick back of the envelope calculation for me though. World populatoin is $7B. Let's say 5% of the world uses bitcoin. That's $350M. Let's say each of those 5% want $1000 worth of bitcoin on average.
With 21M coins, that implies a valuation of about $16,667 per coin. And that doesn't count coins that are lost forever via satoshi or otherwise.
That's always be my "quick and easy" fundamental value.

I'm interested in bitcoin because I was interested in the protocol. I've been here since Bitcoin was $3-$10, back in the GPU mining days. 
Easy money helps too of course, but it's not the only reason I'm here.
I mean, I get your point, but I could easily make the counterpoint that it's weird that I need to express views for a free and open internet in a forum for "magic internet money". They could just as easily blacklist (by not whitelisting) all known nodes and then where would bitcoin be? In a worse place surely.

Did you really just cmopare us to _the_idiot?
Ugh, disgusting.
That being said, the answer to your Q is to make sure that you're going against long term capital gains vs short term (which is taxed as ordinary income). And then now that we're closer to the end of the year, try adn split your sale half this year and half next so that you minimize the amount hitting the highest tax bracket. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:06:02
That is functionally no different than borrowing money to invest in bitcoin though.
And we always talk about "Don't invest more than you're willing to lose" here.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:47:52
You're misunderstanding. I'm saying that it takes more money to move a higher priced asset a given $ figure, which is a smaller % figure.
Hence the lower volatility in a larger priced asset.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:28:46
The other way to view that is that you're now leveraged long on bitcoins.

For some of us, it lets us reset our brackets. For instance, I can't sell any more coins this year unless I want to pay 20% LT gains + 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax on the incremental coins.
I can get some coins in the 0% LT gains bracket for next year, and avoid 3.8% tax on anything less than $200k in sales.

What's the alternative?
Without net neutrality, comcast or any other ISP could decide to blacklist your node, or any node. Or Coinbase's ISP, and then how exactly will we use our magic internet money if not all of us can connect to each other over the INTERNET?
You can't just "go to the competitor" because many of these ISPs operate virtual monopolies. Your other choice is no internet.

@_date: 2017-11-26 16:48:26
Let's take each one of your points.
1) So I don't know who has been saying "it'll help you get rid of mortgage and student loans", but you should stop listening to them. They sound like "get rich quick" conmen. That is NOT what bitcoin was designed to do. The whole point is for it to be inflation-resistant money not controlled by a central government and that is easy to move around the world.
2) This isn't really different than the money you have in your bank account right? That's ALSO just 1s an 0s somewhere.
3) This is actually a valid concern, and what I consider one of the largest barriers to mass adoption. If you don't think you can trust yourself to stop yourself from getting hacked, it's probably a bad idea to get into bitcoin. Because you'll have no one to turn to if you accidentally give someone else all your money. There is no way to roll back those transactions.
That being said, if you're worried about "a mass hacking of bitcoin", you probably don't need to worry about that. It's one of the best parts of bitcoin - there isn't really a way to hack the protocol itself. You can hack USERS of bitcoin, but not bitcoin. And the fact that that hasn't happened despite the HUGE incentive to do so proves its resiliency.
4. Wait, what? Who says you have to BUY a wallet? Just download one onto a secure PC that you have (and don't get hacked).
5. If it's the big scary number that bothers you, remember that you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. A millibit (1/1000th of a bitcoin, and a perfectly usable unit) is right now only $9.10 . You don't have to own a WHOLE bitcoin. You can just own fractions of them.
As far as your ruples question, I googled "ruple" and google autocorrected to rupee. So 1 bitcoin would be about 580,953 rupees right now.
6. Those aren't buzzwords - they're actual terms. And they're very important. You should be able to google to figure out what they mean in the context of bitcoin, or just ask somewhere.
Hopefully that helps!

Currently, ATT doesn't even service my area, and even if it did (a) it is ALSO against net neutrality (b) I would be limited to speed &lt; 40 mbps, like my friend, who hates comcast and went with ATT nearby. He constantly complains that his internet is not quick enough to play online games without a lag that gets him killed.

Check your receiving address on blockexplorer. I bet that receiving address doesn't have anything yet and that's why your coinbase account isn't reflecting anything yet.
What I imagine happened is that the transaction hasn't gone through on the network yet, but Virwox already deducted it from your account balance with them.
In which case, they technically have your btc, they are just in the process of sending it still.

(1) Can you provide some links showing that these were overturned?
(2) Even assuming that they were (which I am not conceding), that still doesn't change the fact that they DID try shady stuff, and courts had to be involved before they stopped. Which was kind of the point of the citing them in the first place. Court should not be necessary, and if it is, a monopoly/duopoly exists that should be regulated.

That doesn't make any sense though (about tether). If they wanted to manipulate the price in that way, why use tether at all?
Just create USD credits in your own exchange and then buy them up, dragging the price up at other exchanges. Nobody would ever be the wiser.
Regarding your "this kind of growth cannot be sustained", yeah, I kind of agree. The problem is when do you jump off. Too early and you miss the boat. Too late and you're a bagholder. I sold some at $1100, $2400 (where MtGox was solvent again. Figured that'd put a cap on things...I was wrong), $4700, and $3400...and I regret EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

A free market would be great, but not realistic in the US because of how big it is landwise.
Romania is a lot smaller than the US, and thus there are multiple ISPs that can compete.

You're going to need to elaborate on that.
Because without net neutrality, Comcast, Verizon, Time Warner, ATT, and other ISPs literally get to control what you can access on the internet.
Don't see what that has to do with Roger Ver.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:59:56
Happily, knowing that without people like him, our bitcoin would probably still be almost worthless.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:13:02
Those two resources are godsends.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:08:37
I mean, we can just keep talking about ISPs honestly.
For instance, the onerous cost of putting in fiber leads to a natural monopoly there. Technically, it's a duopoly, since for most places you *technically* have the choice between Comcast/Time Warner and ATT. That's discounting the fact that ATT actually can't reach the same speeds as cable (Comcast/Time Warner). but let's go with that.
It's not financially viable to lay fiber everywhere just to compete. Look at google fiber. Google themselves said they weren't out to make a profit, just to provide competition, since otherwise, the cost of laying all that fiber would be too high of a barrier to entry.
It's not feasible to expect a new entrant to have the resources to lay all that fiber. Comcast / Time Warner only got to do it because they were given huge amounts of money by the government to do it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:38:31

Their primary demographic is one that bitcoin doesn't have a lot of exposure to, so this could increase the userbase.
On the otherhand, if they're just going to have Sheldon or one of the guys lose all their money, this could be bad news because the older demographic will be like "lol, only stupid people invest in bitcoin."
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:50:27

@_date: 2017-11-22 14:38:06
It *would* be a huge opportunity in the market to fill that gap and make money, but the barriers to entry are too large to make it happen. In part because of government enabled monopolies.
Comcast is literally the most hated company in America, and yet in many places, it's still the only ISP around. Why do you think that is? Because people aren't motivated enough to switch? No, it's because they CAN'T switch.
So you and I agree that government fuckery is bad - but the only option here better than having net neutrality rules is to abolish the oligolopolies and monopolies that are there. That decision is currently not up for vote though.
@_date: 2019-04-10 16:10:16
lol, what was I thinking? :D
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:06:16
There's no way to put the genie back in the bottle now without government intervention.
So at this point, if your solution is to DO NOTHING (which is what repealing Title II would do), then you leave us with the worst of both worlds. A monopoly that exists, and no way for consumers to deal with it.
Your solution is "end the monopoly", but you can't functionally do that now.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:04:17
So let's take an extreme scenario. Tons of dollars go into shorting next month's financial futures and bring the futures price of Bitcoin in January to $2000. Meanwhile, physical bitcoins are at, let's say $9,000 for nice round numbers.
Rational actors holding bitcoins would then see that hey, if I want to sell at get $9k now, that's way better than waiting until January when the price will probably be lower than $9k.
So they, sell. And others sell. And others sell, until the final price going into January is some amount &gt;$2k probably, but also &lt; $9k.
This is how you could create a lower physical bitcoin price without ever owning any bitcoins, or having to borrow any to short.
Yes, you'd need a ton of $$$, but that's something that many CME trading firms have in spades.

@_date: 2018-03-28 15:14:29
You understand incorrectly.
GPUs made to mine can ONLY mine. GPUs made to game can game AND mine.
You get mildly better performance and more robust heatsinks and stuff with cards made just to mine, but imo getting a gaming card is less risky because at the end of the day if crypto goes kaput, you at least still have a gaming card.
That's how I felt way back in the day when you could actually mine bitcoin directly with GPUs.

But before you do it, let's make a bet. I'd bet you up to 10 btc (can be smaller, that's just the max I am willing to risk) that the people answering "crypto" would be at least 10:1. We can ask one of the mods to escrow or or something.
As far as my "people like you" comment that you seem so offended about. You said yourself you would go to crypto in a market crash, so I'm not really sure why you seem so offended.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:16:06
Okay, this helps to ease the pain a bit. Ty. :D
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:14:05
While this is good news, they're definitely late to the party.
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:22:27
Weird. They're the same co...?
Thanks for the datapoint though!
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:43:07
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:38:08
But don't you have the same problem with coinbase?
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:44:51
 They specifically said to withdraw your coins if you wanted bch
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:30:25
He didn't lead with the helmet. He went in for the tackle and incidentally did that because of the way the receiver moved his head.
Your priorities in that situation as a a defender are, in order, (1) bring the ballcarrier down, THEN (2) try not to hurt him. Not the other way around.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:24:29
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:29:34
Why does the person seem scared?
Seems like this would be more appropriate in a falling market.
That being said, for now, WE PARTAAAAY
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:11:56
That's not even true.
Stop acting like people who are good with money are the enemy.
I'm a proud member of both, and was a member of before I even got into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:43:05
This should have been the $6k bitconity gif haha.
I LOVE IT. TY
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:43:36
Yes, and another important thing to note, is that difficulty reset times would also be 10x longer. So instead of an average of 2 weeks, it would be 20 weeks. Which would...suck.
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:29:28
Gdax at least has been fee free withdrawals for me.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:49:16
Ya sure why not. If he was going to throw it in your face, just air quote exactly what he sent you.
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:56:59
wtf bitpay?
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:08:23
"I had bitcoin to experiment with and when it shot up high, I said, 'I don't want to become one of those people that watches it, watches it and cares about the number.' I don't want that kind of care in my life," 
Uh...shit, that's me. Maybe I need to re-evaluate my life.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:19:11
This is funny, but not quite accurate.
BCH is still trading at what bitcoin was just 18 months ago.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:36:26
You must have invested a metric fuck ton if your cost basis was $2991. Damn!
Also, don't forget to pay your taxes.
@_date: 2018-07-28 23:45:19
Dude this is crazy. Thanks for writing the replay protection code and for putting up with crazies like this for all of us.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:54:08
Most people there despite Dave Ramsey's advice.
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:57:11
I mean, if someone was pointing a gun at people I loved and said I needed to send over btc, is probably be coerced into doing so...
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:52:38
Using btc as collateral for my house loan?
So if btc were to drop, I not only lose a ton of money in bitcoin, but also might have my mortgage due immediately? Ehhhh
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:19:19
Ignore . He doesn't seem to understand that greater merchant adoption helps EVERYONE in the bitcoin community.
You're a Ford dealer?!?! OSHIT. LET'S TALK.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:36:44
Coinbase is as easy as paypal.
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:16:30
That's how we started. And that's how I still think about it. I remember giving and receiving random tips in bitcoin back it was like $3-$10.
Right now, until the implementation of the lightning network though, fees are high for small purchases.
On the plus side though, I found someone who is willing to sell Fords in bitcoin (, and THAT'S REALLY COOL.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:01:12
Um...we are in a thread with the original post...? Why would he have to link back to the thread that you are talking in?
But here, I guess? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:25:20
okay, that's kind of funny lol.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:33:10
Why don't you buy on gdax instead? It's the same login.
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:50:43
Huh. Weird that Coinbase and Gdax have different policies. My bad.
Anyway, back to your original point then, I don't know why the transaction fee would stop anyone from getting control of their private keys to get their BCH unless they had such small amounts that meh, it wouldn't really matter in the grand scheme of things anyway?
Better than not having access to your BCH at all?
@_date: 2019-09-03 23:28:42
Did that just tell me to buy Fiji water in a recession?!
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:15:02
4% is assuming you only have 25 years left to live usually (normal retirement).
2.5 to 3% is supposed to hopefully be self sustaining forever.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:16:57
will sell you Ford and Lincoln cars from his dealership!
I'm getting my next mustang from him, guaranteed.
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:23:39


Literally yes. You keep talking as though I'm some nocoin bitcoin non-believer (aka a shill).
Your original point was that in a US market crash (the original linked article), people would buy more crypto, to which I said no - they wouldn't, and provided reasoning why. And then you went way off the rails.
Take your combative attitude and autism and go fap and take the edge or something. FFS dude.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:58:49
I doooo
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:40:04
Lol true that. "Oh no my small speculative investment has now become a LARGE speculative investment all by itself!"
Truly first world problems here haha.
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:48:24
Don't steal from [Viva La Dirt League]( dude...
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:07:50
Except we all did here... regardless of whether we had coins in gox
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:51:10
Um, a lot of us that want to trade on gdax?
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:51:37
No way. They wouldn't go from risky assets (equities) to EVEN RISKIER ones.
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:49:48
Think of them as two separate coins now that had identical starts.
Yes, if you can find a safe BCH wallet, you can import your keys and then send you BCH to an exchange to exchange for BTC.
As a precaution, I would say move your BTC to a new address that you control BEFORE you do that, but technically this step is optional.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:19:27
Okay that's actually pretty great. Bravo!
@_date: 2016-10-26 20:48:11
lol even better.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:01:20
This is actually pretty funny. Bravo haha.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:45:11
Yeah but isn't about highly speculative investments. That's or well...here haha. 
It's supposed to be about good, lower risk decisions that involve your personal finance.
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:28:20
As a member of both and no we're not.
The two subs have VERY different philosophies. We're moonkids here, but at slow and steady wins the race. Keep things simple, live below your means, don't gamble.
Don't get your panties in a bunch just because not everyone wants to be involved in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-26 20:43:00
Hmm, that sucks. Maybe ask fiverr what to do.
Your transaction definitely got lost in the current backlog though.
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:25:23
To be fair, Coinbase is just the largest company around, so if this guy that called you wanted to be shady, he'd just shove that name around.
It is entirely possible that Coinbase has nothing to do with this.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:12:30
For serious, WHO DOESN'T THINK WE'RE AT THE MOON NOW?
We're trying to go to Mars now.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:23:41
I'd join this lawsuit and help pay legal fees. How do I do so?
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:17:25
Kudos to you for receiving the point well!
Not that common of an occurrence on the internet. :)
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:43:26
You owe taxes on your realized gains. If you're really planning on not paying them, I sure hope you're getting all this in cash on localbitcoins or some other relatively untraceable way, or you going to have a hefty tax bill in the not too distant future.
{edit: and actually, even if you sold on localbitcoins, a deposit of $75k is probably way out of the norm for your activity, so that will probably still be huge red flags that will set off an audit. Pay your taxes dude.}
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:48:15
'ish. It was more of a "buy the rumor, sell the news" kind of a situation.
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:49:13
How did he possibly help you get it back if you threw out the hard drive?
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:22:32
I dunno about that. I've been here since $3 coins and I was definitely the [roller coaster dude](
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:10:30
MY FAVORITE
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:39:11
uh I dunno about you, but to me $2500 was the moon.
Now, it's whether or not we can get to Mars. Or if this was the end of the line and we have to go back to Earth...
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:49:13
Just say it's a two factor authentication device.
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:02:38
Welp, much less fun hodling on the way down.
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:44:27
There need to be more charts on that last pic of "What I really do"
But otherwise lolololol
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:43:57
I dunno. That seems like a reach to me.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:00:56
Two whole months ago? haha
...or with Gox? before the bear market that last years?
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:45:35
This is amazing. Thank you for writing that.
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:24:39
Woah shit it's my cake day?!!?? THANK YOU!

F that. I LOVE MY ROLLERCOASTER DUDE GOING UP

I LOVE THAT WEBSITE where you screenshotted that from haha.
My favorite price checker now.

@_date: 2018-04-24 13:25:40
Fuck Block Explorer. I used to love using them. And then they betrayed us all.
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:08:02
I stand corrected.
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:51:27
That's pretty slick. I would definitely do it if I were you hah.
@_date: 2017-05-08 13:26:18
Free $22,500? That's nice. Kudos
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:44:18
Bitmain. And no, Jihan Wu owns it. Sucks for us.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:42:58
Good enough? :D
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:02:22
The answer is yes.
Also, because your professor would not have put this as a question unless he/she believed the answer was yes. It would have otherwise just been otherwise ignored.
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:01:25
Oh shit. I need a debit card? that's why I couldn't figure it out.
What are the limits? Anywhere near the $15k/day that Coinbase has?
Thank you!
@_date: 2016-10-26 20:42:42
Um that is literally one of its uses.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:18:40
yeah but he's disappointed. Are you?
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:17:16
What? Haven't they all seriously outperformed even btc's amazing performance over the last 2 months?
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:01:28
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:35:16
So then how are the bitcoins lost?
Sounds like you deposited into your account, someone took control of your account, and then moved the money to Gdax, where they presumably bought coins, and then sent them to themselves...?
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:32:12
One of these things is not like the other...
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:42:17
If you timed this correctly, you might have actually sold at the top around 1600. Congrats on that and on the house dude!
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:44:58
:'( That was me, looking sad just a few years ago.
@_date: 2016-10-13 21:05:03
No, because we're not operating on a fractional reserve system.
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:50:26
Noway, really?
Shit, I should go say nice things to my 7970. It's been retired from btc mining for years now.
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:48:57
Too late. The euphoria seems to be arriving.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:19:01
Yes, seriously. Like yay for us hodlers, but let's not pretend that our foray into btc was anything but wild speculation that (so far) has worked out.
They have different risk appetites than we do. And that's okay.
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:18:45
How do I get my full node (the full client from bitcoin.org, right?) to signal for UASF 0.3?
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:11:54
Well, I was going to type something up, but that's more eloquent than anything I was going to say.
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:44:03
You can say that, but you'll have to *prove* it, with sales receipts and purchase recipts at that price.
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:02:55
Gdax seems fine for me...?
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:26:29
No, actually. I didn't use google. I used to mine on slush's pool. I respect him immensely, and if I was still in the mining game, I would still be with his pool.
Beyond that, I "get that sentiment" just from being active here in the community.
Just because he values stability over GAINZ doesn't mean that he's trying to manipulate the market.
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:51:27
... :/
Hilarious is one way to describe it...
horrifying would be mine. Like wtf, you can't make this shit up.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:20:11
How were you in the red for 5-6 years? You should have been breakeven within 2 if you were still buying cheaply.
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:15:13
That wasn't my point. I wanted cautionary stories of "oshit, look what happened to this person." to temper the euphoria of MOOOOOON
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:49:21
Uh, how about not.
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:36:57
Holy shit... O.o
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:30:09
I still don't get how to get bitcoin on circle.
I signed up a few weeks ago since I was tired of essentially paying 2% each way on coinbase and... I'm just left going ???
@_date: 2016-05-31 17:38:56
Oh that's cool. I was looking for a new book. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:52:12
UNLIKE REAL LIFE ROLLER COASTERS, GOING UP IS MORE FUN ON THE BITCOIN ROLLER COASTER!
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:40:22
beat me to it lol
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:16:15
Ohhh. I thought you literally threw it out, like in the garbage.
I was like "wtf did he do...?"
Congrats on reclaiming your btc. :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:28:57
How would a hardware wallet help you with coinbase being up/down?
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:55:33
"wiped his computer"
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:48:40
I mean, it's still almost $60k, which is more than most people have in their bank accounts.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:28:04
Holy shit. YOU'RE REAL
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:00:34
Yes, that's how bubbles work?
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:38:28
Slush is, and has been, the most friendly and responsible pool owner, even since bitcoin was still mined with GPUs.
He is doing this not to hurt all of us, but to protect us from rash actions.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:17:55
Oshit, that's actually a lot of money now.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:41:48
Sounds like you got your account hacked...?
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:08:28
I imagine it's just a lot more difficult than we imagine to change the automatic fee calculated.
Either that, or it's low on their list of priorities on their "to do" list.
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:06:04
You could have bought more bitcoin at the time.
You sold it at $202.
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:15:23
Yeah but that doesn't make him crazy...?
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:23:59
I'm less concerned about them relaunching, and more concerned with them basically putting up a 200,000 btc sell wall at 2480 or wherever it is in order to pay back creditors.
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:40:39
Well, if it's supposed to be a clone of bitcoin, except that it does segwit, I can see why *some* people might prefer Litecoin...
Competitive advantage and all that.
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:34:04
Thanks for spreading the news. It's crazy over there.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:06:30
They didn't rollback the trades. They only gave back money to the losers. I fail to see how this is anything but a good thing for the community at large.
Winners kept their money. Losers got refunded. Gdax was poorer.
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:54:45
Ya, signed up for them because they're a major sponsor of Pod Save America, my favorite podcast.
They're trying to become relevant. Hopefully they will make it. Would rather deal with them than venmo tbh.
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:39:24
That's not how hodling works...
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:29:18
Are we not at the moon yet?
We're going to Mars now if this keeps up
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:51:32
I mean, a 5% move in normal investments is ALSO a big deal...
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:44:08
All good! Props to recognizing your mistake and owning up to it. It's a quality sorely lacking in most convos on the internet. :)
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:57:15
Absolutely terrible. You might earn like $.10 before you factor in electricity costs.
Maybe ethereum would treat you better.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:18:33
...because we live in the real world, where most transactions occur in fiat?
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:56:02
Yeah, that's true, but I like to "confirm" that my wallet actually holds it, so I connect it whenever I deposit.
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:18:21
Maybe nothing. Maybe the red wedding.
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:28:45
FUCKING STOP POKING IT FFS!!!
@_date: 2015-02-23 15:07:35
except that technical analysis *only* works if nearly everyone does it...
@_date: 2017-07-22 13:56:04
...how would this mechanism work exactly?
Let's say I have 1 btc in my desktop wallet. How will I get the btcc? Do I have to go and download a btcc wallet and import my wallet.dat into *that*?
Surely my normal bitcoin wallet wouldn't know wtf to do with btcc.
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:48:00
I was literally googling this xkcd for . Thanks for doing that.
Idiotic that someone can really think that climate change is not man made in large part and real.
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:37:15
...how do I read that?
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:05:42
Ohhhh thank you
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:10:17
They're not making extra money though? You can see the fee paid in the blockchain, right?
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:45:50
Fiat is FDIC insured, so you're good in fiat imo.
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:30:59
Something something zombie gox, something something 200k coins. something something Mt Gox is solvent at around 2400-ish?
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:49:41
Yes. They might be fine, but history has shown us time and time again that entrusting others to hold your btc is &lt; securing it yourself, unless you're just an absolute idiot about it.
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:34:36
He sold it and they drug his company into the ground (and his name in the process). I'd be pissed if I was him.
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:42:06
FUCKING STOP POKING IT. FOR FUCK'S SAKE.
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:37:00
They're not a regular thing.
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:19:28
Depends on your exchange. And depends on what kind of position you have with said exchange (leveraged long, leveraged short, futures, etc).
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:20:58
Definitely not. A rising tide lifts all boats. A falling tide sinks all boats.
And people don't go from risky assets (equities) to even RISKIER assets (crypto) in a market crash.
Even Gold fell during the 2008 financial crisis, and it was a safe haven as a flight to safety.
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:09:14
It's $650
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:31:37
Well, I definitely blame this drop on you. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:16:22
Well, for my part, I have my wallet connected to a computer with almost nothing else but windows and my wallet on it. And that computer only connects to the internet when I make a transaction into or out of the wallet. That way, no one should be able to remote in and fiddle with my wallet or grab my wallet.dat.
I also have a backup elsewhere.
Mycelium wallet is the one I use. You have to input a really long password to transfer any money out.
But if you google "how to keep your bitcoin wallet secure", I'm sure it will give you good ideas. :)

If it's not there...I'd say those btc are gone... :/
@_date: 2017-05-06 20:24:58
Just last month I was able to withdraw, and even though they said 5 business days, it was there in 2.

@_date: 2017-07-24 22:49:58
FDIC insurance works for anyone who pays into the insurance. Coinbase is one of those entities.
Why the downvote?

lol, bitcoin used to be that way until guiminer came onto the scene.
...fuck I'm old.

To be fair, most people would be like "this is a random piece of paper" vs instantly recognizing it as a seed. But ya, I hear you.
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:26:21
I looked into it. I heard it isn't worth it for 7970s. Something about memory constraints?

It's been awhile since I was able to use this phrase from fatwallet finance.
"Pay your bills, deadbeat." If you're up that much, you're probably a long term hodler, so you're paying long term cap gains tax anyway.

Well, yeah. What good is a currency you can't spend?
Even the pizza guy was like (and I'm paraphrasing) "No, I don't regret it. It was proof of concept that you could actually use this as a currency. It encouraged others to treat it as such."

23.8% is the highest. 3.8% surcharge after $200k in income, on top of the 20% long term capital gains.

I remember when I could mine with GPUs and the difficulty was in the millions (not even the tens of millions).
Good times. I loved slush's pool.

What incident are you referring to? Link?

Yeah okay, have fun with your problem then.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:53:03
Yeah this was...unexpected.
@_date: 2016-07-18 13:37:53
Mined lots at $3-$10, sold a ton (like 5/6's of my holdings at $10 :'(   )
But I still have some from those days. Also, I bought at $1000, $900, $800, $500, $300, $250...
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:21:13
Okay, that's pretty good

You could try localbitcoins?

Yeah, also, there is AMT to consider.
I got fucked when I thought I was SOOOO clever, doing specific lot accounting to reduce my cost basis. But wait, nope - got hit with AMT for an additional $7k. Felt like an asshole.
Especially since I waited to sell some coins at $20k "because the new tax year is so close. I'll use fresh tax brackets"
joke was on me...
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:30:22
You fucking broke it...

Oshit, maybe this is the top now then.

With civil forfeiture, that tends to just be with pure hard cash.
If you put it into a bank account AND pay taxes on it, you should be fine.
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:38:17
Do it ASAP. Gdax, for instance, only allows withdrawals of $10k/day.
There is no benefit whatsoever to waiting.

I'm so happy I mined with his pool way back in the day.

So what you're saying is that the drop from Monday is basically as much as Bitcoin was worth for me a year ago.
...hmmm, shit? O.o
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:43:27
localbitcoins is the only option if they don't want to go through identity requirements.
Coinbase is about as easy as it gets, but they do have to cover their asses with KYC language.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:15:11
Oh okay, we're on the same page then.
For me, it was easier just to have the cash in there and trade at an average of .05%, than to pay the almost 2% for an instant buy.

It's ALL the media outlets. It's the entire sample size.

That's pretty even tempered, especially for a conservative leaning publication.

Wait, what about Gargamel and smurfs?
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:20:35
What are you talking about? That wasn't Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:05:08
Yeah, fuck that guy.
He is the reason I never got into ethereum in the first place. I figured any coin that had to do that was 100% a scam, and then the Dao happened and I was like "well fuck that."
Never even looked into it further because of him. I could have been mining with my GPUs like I did for bitcoin way back in the day if that PM hadn't poisoned me against it.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:16:20
That would be epic, but it would also mean that he could do that at any time to the chain he favors as well. It would be massively bearish news.
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:20:14
What do I need to change?
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:58:41
Okay, this is pretty funny hahaha
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:54:27
Oh man, guess I missed the ethereum mining boat.
Sucks, since I got into bitcoin on the bitcoin mining boat WAAAAY back in the day at $3 coins.
My poor graphics cards, sitting idle all this time.

You can laugh, but it doesn't make it less true. It's not like they're Breitbart or OccupyDemocrats or something.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:00:25
No? You either have the cash on the exchange, and have your btc instantly. Or you don't.
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:31:25
No, they are telling him to withdraw his funds, but not allowing him to.
Left hand not talking to the right hand kind of situation. Only the brain can see the full picture and come to a solution, but he can't reach the brain.

NOW WE FALLING. IS THIS BETTER?!??!!
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:57:25
Don't feel bad. Better than the 200 coins I sold at $10, trying to buy back at $8.
Or the 40 coins I got scammed out of back when it was $10 and that I didn't rebuy.
Or the windows 7 key I bought for one whole bitcoin back at $32 (I felt SO SMART after the value fell after lolol).
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:22:58
Wtf is "btc recover?"
Is your wallet on your phone? or not? I don't understand what your computer's motherboard has to do with ANY of this if your wallet is on your phone.
Your original post strongly implied that your wallet was on your computer (whose motherboard malfunctioned).
{Edit: okay, so apparently the one way you can get your btc off of your phone is with this program? Get a new motherboard then. Or use another computer}
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:25:08
Well on the plus side, if it's just your motherboard that crapped out, you should be fine?
Your wallet is stored on your hard drive, so bring that drive to another computer, access your wallet.dat, and you should be good to go?
Alternatively, you can replace your motherboard if you think that's the only problem.
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:28:16
I'm pretty invested. Been around since "the gold old days" of GPU mining and $3 coins.
I watch CNN.

Welp, these are not rosy scenarios.
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:39:15
I *was* being kind. You'll notice I'm one of only two people in here that responded to your question, and everyone who has tried to respond was under the impression that your wallet was on your computer. My response has the highest number of upvotes in here, meaning that other people ALSO thought that your wallet was on your computer.
At this point though, you've probably chased off anyone who could help you answer your question about an S8 being powerful enough to run this software you're talking about. Your best bet is to try it and see.

To you and me, bitcoin and ethereum are very different things.
To the laymen, they're very similar, and if one burns them, they will never get into the other one.
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:46:57
I withdrew 2 weeks ago to my bank account and it got there within 1 business day, less than the 4-5 that was quoted.
I requested a btc withdrawal last night and it was in the blockchain a few minutes later.

Yeah I'm sad I missed the 2nd go around of GPU mining. Stupid spammy message here in turned me off of it completely.
