Funny how PayPal claims BitCoin is their `original vision` but now they block accounts of people with different opinions.

No joke Sherlock.

People know to protect their credit card, bank account, and social security number? That's news to me.
Other sources inform me that bank and credit card fraud are almost as common as theft. Source: 
Not to mention that cyber crime would surge far past the moon when BTC becomes the de facto currency.

They go hand-in-hand. If S2X becomes the mainchain then these "criminal bankers and corporations" won.

BitCoin is already accepted by lots of companies, there's absolutely no reason to believe it won't be.

Negative. It'll be dead when S2X passes. Bitcoin is only `truly` dead when the philosophy dies, which is then.

I think it's more about the direction BitCoin is heading towards than it is about actual technicalities. S2X might not directly cause a destruction of decentralization but the direction will eventually lead there. When you give people a finger they will rip your entire torso off, every, single, time.

I'm astonished that you compare the two. Old tarts fall for every phishing mail sent to them. Except with BitCoin, they'd lose all of their money. _That_ is why it won't be mainstream anytime soon.
