you may see huge sell volumes on exchanges. but keep in mind that the average joe can't even get to exchanges, ATM being the easiest way to get any bitcoin for them

just use bitstamp or i think u can use our services here called bl3p with sepa

real average joes don't know what bitcoin really is. you will be surprised with how little average joes know. but ATM is universal

we have it in netherlands....fun, until u see the 7-12% premium
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:55:15
35% extra!? i do'nt think it's that much. the ones i know follow bitstamp price  + 12%. even that is huge

it's not so much as they ran out. but they ran out of bitcoins to tell at that price. Why would they sell their whole stash at such low price.

i am a bit sad cause it happened to some poeple in america who got conned.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:54:28
That's the strength of FOMO. when poeple hear stories of people getting rich. they will jump in

look at linkedin. he has tons of blockchain people for hire. he is playing the masses like fiddle to when he wants btc to go up or down

Holy shit this is nuts. i was installing it on my new device and was utterly annoyed by it and thinking of getting trezor. Yay team ledger

Yea but we already heard that you had to cause chrome apps are going away. At least one good news that you are doing a unified app. The current one is awful

I am quite invested in this and I started in April! lets just say if I perform even half as well as you I can retire very well

that's amazing! USD x30. how did u do it? alt coins? margins?
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:18:33
either you are a very good trader or lady luck is by your side. either way. a big win!

i have a ledger. all apps don't work properly. new app coming in Q2. Ledger hardware look plasticky but the new one looks nice. the usage looks easier on youtube  videos.
haven't used trezor, but with my ledger i wish i went for trezor
*oh forgot to mention ledger is good on one hand because it's integrated to more sites eg idex
