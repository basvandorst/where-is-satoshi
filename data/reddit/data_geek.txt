I understood that you could build a strong server, free OS like Linux, and have high bandwidth that is 24x7 reliable, then follow a guide on getting the node setup and running. I don't understand why that would be costly? At least to me, I'm an IT guy that does this type of thing for a day job. Then from there, I presume you can perform mining, you must have your own node setup to conduct the mining on, correct? 
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:18:37
It's source and history is deception and misleading 
@_date: 2017-01-18 12:37:58
Yes, do you understand what "Fake News" is, which often comes disguised in the form of an op-ed or opinion.

It does all that then the two tiny different values charges and inputting that in any combo and it still says not found 
@_date: 2017-01-17 04:10:20
Is mining, whether you join a pool and do it on someone else computer, or if you do it on your own node, is it a time consuming manual process you physically carry out, or is it a matter of setting up a configuration in software, and the letting it loose to chew away? 
@_date: 2017-01-18 03:48:26
But the lies are so ridiculous that its basically fake news 
@_date: 2017-01-18 12:20:55
This type of op-ed, from the source, makes their content (almost) by default fake news in a sorts. Sorry, Prez O and the last 8 yrs and their main stream relationship has me a little more than ill and distrusting 
@_date: 2017-01-17 03:55:32
Perhaps  I'm misundertanding, I'm new to this and am researching, and I have gone through all the links prior. So, you can mine Bitcoin, without having your own node? Can you still mine somewhere somehow and not have your own node? Seems I may have been mislead, but I had the distinct impression that building a strong high 9's box with wide reliable up/down bandwidth was all was needed to get node into the matrix.

yes, it seems BTC is a honey Badger once again while alts all went up, and makes me wish i wasn't 100% BTC and moved some out to thealt markets but oh well next time
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:30:54
Did you mean 2nd ref to BTC was BCC?
3 days ago I was 90% BTC, 5%ETH, 5%XRP, over last two days watching BTC tank and BCC moon, I decided to remodel my portfolio, Now: 45% BTC, 44% BCC, remaining 11% across ETH, XRP, LTC, &amp; NEO. Between now and EOY, I’ll add more high cap Alts like DASH, XMR &amp; XEM, stop buying BTC, buy more BCC if it remains strong, add into existing Alts, and HODL the new BTG and watch what happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:14:43
Is it plugged in?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:24:46
I know it jumped and pulled back, but segwit2x has had a bad effect for so much that it created uncertainty. And if it happened I think the coin split and pricing/valuation on them would be super degraded and I was afraid it would be the pin in the ballon of Bitcoin as a whole. Why do you feel it may go down? And why do you say I’m looking I. The wrong place? I ask as I want more understanding for my own edification 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:28:13
And Im sitting here wondering what hi cap Alt I’m moving it from bch, manipulating like that is short lived. Now when I move out I have nothing but fill in the blank, everything too 10 Alt Coin

Perhaps they should investigate illegal use of U$D as well as Securities and themselves with how they spend our taxes like drunken crack whores.

IOTA was one of two (NEO) that I’m considering pulling out of BCH and wait for BTC to get on its feet, if ever. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:13:44
Sorry, didn't follow you, are you saying that that the can of s2x and the price going up (then down, then sideways) don't have a connection with one another?
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:36:05
Personally, I've gone back and forth as to whether or not it's a real bubble, or if it started at some point being bubble like, then morphed into something that we may never have seen before, perhaps, simply a growing market that's long overdue. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:43:43
Hell to the Fork Yeah! I hated the NYA and SegWit2X crap-a-dinka from day one, it was to do nothing but fork up real Bitcoin, perhaps kill it, now it's tiem to go to the moon

My question too, what happened that cause a sharp dip, when will it stop, buy more now? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:18:23
You sir, are awesome 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:58:41
And the surge being to buy more traditonal BTC1 as in good ole BTC, and not the futures of B2X, correct? I had the impression people were loading up and were on the Segwit chain in hopes it splits and they have free token rain down upon them. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:23:04
Some ass at Bloomberg yesterday said Bitcoin is a fraud and will go bust. There has also been the Chinese crackdown. N Korean said they back off on nukes due to new sanctions. Not sure the real impact of all this on digital-coins

That is true, as a matter of fact, you can select one or the other. Nice. Another reason why I feel good about the NanoS

Of course I have, I want real hard answers and I want them now 
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:55:45
Thank you for clarifying. I had specifically moved them recently after buying more to a Ledger Nano S, and it costs a small fee to go moving back and forth. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:40:26
So I conclude after reading everything, that NYA are a bunch of A-holes who are effing up good ole legacy btc and are generally reckless with their hard fork en-devour, and is creating serious FUD around Bitcoin anything in general. So it seems now, don't buy BTC, get out of BTC, and buy Eth or spread it around the top 10 altcoins and wait for the NYA dumbasses to get out of the way. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:03:57
Same question here, though I have my btc account in a hard wallet, and moved it from bittrex, it originated from Coinbase/GDAX. When I check on it with Nano S HW, I select the traditional Bitcoin and not SegWit. So that’s my question as well, can I leave it where it is, as I’m also about to drop a very large deposit into it as well. I understand you will get airdropped free coin when the hard fork happens in November.

Monero the bastard step child 
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:14:02
I understand that I hold the keys on my wallet and the coin is in the block chain. However what’s confusing is what I read from bittrex, sounded like you had to leave the wallet account on the Exchange in order to get the new coin. So as long as I have BTC in the blockchain, doesn’t matter how I hold the keys, I still get the new coins? Does it matter what Exchange you deal with?

I’ve been asking this very question in regards to having mine on a hard wallet in several groups. Some kind people have said no it’s ok leave ok hw and you’ll still get gold and x2. Buy quite a number have been major dicks and assholes in the quest for the right answer. So here’s the scoop, leave in a wallet where you hold the keys, after all the splits, the exchanges that will support gold and x2 will help you split the cost off your device. With hw’s and the like, coins you have never leave the chain, it’s where your keys are located, the site can hold them or you can.

Thanks for the feedback, let me ask a few questions albeit perhaps dumb..., Core plowing ahead with scaling efforts means to make the hard fork for betting Bitcoin scaling a mute point? B2X, what is that, F2Pool is not longer getting ready for the impact of a SegWit2X hardfork? BT thats the token that gets created by SegWit hardforking, and people are buying its futures and the hard cap and about gone now, so that means by the time the fork (if it) happens theres no free tokens raining down?
Bottom line, should I buy BTC and not care about any of this, or if I drop $5K USD into BTC make sure im in SegWit Exchange and not traditional? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:38:19
That’s awesome, excellent perseverance, and major kudos to this group and others like it. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:35:36
It's humorous how traditional banks and financial institutions are truly scared of Bitcoin and what it brings to the worlds table can only bad mouth it and come off sounding like loons at this point. Even the common man parrots to me what the big fear mongers are squawking at them. I just clutch my hard wallet, smile, and move on.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:54:08
I've had it for just less than two weeks, and flashed it with firmware when I got it, and then d/l'd new apps from the ledger manager into it, so I get the impression they must be trying to get in front of having a new block-chain for it, and BTW its the same for LTC withing the Nano
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:38:03
You sir, are extremely awesome

I would think if everyone did that then the miners have to mine on legacy btc and not pirate x2
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:13:36
I meant the Hard fork coming, or not, in Nov17, and people loading up to get on the B2X coin, being in the SegWit Block chain? and not the traditional. Maybe I'm misunderstanding, as when I use Nano and go to connect to check my Bitcoin wallet, I have to choose which block chain, Bitcoin or Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:09:40
So you’re saying I need to move my btc off hard wallet and on to the bittrex exchange wallet in order to get the BTG? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:19:53
Same here, please dwell 
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:11:10
Is this to say don't hold it in your Ledger Wallet? But instead move it out and onto a legacy BTC exchange like Bitrex? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:18:41
Ledger Nano S, HODL a lot of wallets plus can act as a security key on websites. One way to use it is once the ledger is full of wallets and you need more, get Electrum and use the Fido U2F on Electrum to secure that access to the rest of your wallets.
