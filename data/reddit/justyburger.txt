You know a coin is being pumped when the illiterate Floyd “Money” Mayweather shills it. Anybody remember “Centra”? They raised $30 million, and are now being sued in a class action lawsuit. Anytime someone famous starts talking about a crypto currency, I know to stay away.

So only 4? Because let’s be honest, Montana has maybe like 75 people looking to trade crypto?

Man, I’m sorry, but btc is going to die a slow, agonizing death. There will never be another 20,000 again. The technology is outdated, and people are starting to realize this fact.

It only hurts your score if you don’t pay on time. If you pay on time, it helps your score.

Honestly though, why do you think that? When is lightning coming out? When are transaction fees going to be less than $40.00? I hold BTC, and only because I think we might bounce, but what is the reason we will go up again? Bitcoin REALLY feels like it has had its day already.

Yes. Never buy or sell on Coinbase. Just use it to transfer fiat in and out of gdax.

Yes, but don’t let anyone in here know we are talking about this.

Yea, with like ten companies.

Open a Coinbase account.

Lol that was dumb

How much did the transaction cost you? Did you stand there at the register for 8 hours to wait for confirmations, or did the cashier just trust that it would go through?

Jesus Christ you people are delusional. Please, quote me in that, if bitcoin ever gets back to 15,000+, or even has any real world applications. You know how many people came before all of these successful inventions that failed?

Umm?
