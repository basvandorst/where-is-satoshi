Really? You should have known its a fraud... Do everyone a favor and stop trusting people just because they use bitcoin. 
In fact, the whole point of bitcoin is that you don't trust anyone.
Ask a simple question, if you wouldn't trust them in the fiat world, don't trust them in the bitcoin world.

Those are pre-owned cards. That's an entirely different product altogether

Google learns about your preferences and only shows you what you want to see. This speaks more about you than about either google or bitcoin.
View it through an anonymizer and you won't see bitcoin anywhere

Haha. Same here

But where do you actually buy the tickets? I can't see anyplace online to pay with bitcoin

To be honest, I've yet to go to a place on coinmap and have them actually take bitcoin. Been disappointed so often, I think coinmaps largely a joke. Did you really go there and pay or just see this on coinmap?

I try to shop there too but they just don't have the huge variety that Amazon does
