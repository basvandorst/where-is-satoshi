Pyramid Scheme more than a Ponzi Scheme.
Everyone is trying to make money off the people who buy into the system *after* them, and no one wants to be the last one holding BTC when the bottom falls out.

Meanwhile you can just effortlessly PayPal them $40 at no cost and it happens instantly.
Ironic how Bitcoin started as a hassle free way to send money without being nickel and dimed. Now it's 100x worse than the thing it was created to beat.

Currencies have low levels of inflation on purpose to help the lower class laborers such as yourself. 
It would be hell to live in an econony where all currency was deflationary. The rich would get richer at exponential rates and the class divide would be far greater. 
It baffles the mind how so many people making minimum wage are upset inflation affects their labor currency. It's literally there to **help** laborers try and have some semblance of a chance to catch up with families that are already vastly more wealthy than them.

Dollars aren't going anywhere. If the USD collapses, life as the world knows it is over. Bitcoins would quickly be worthless since no one will even have power or running water.

People have made a fortune selling rare Beanie Babies, but it doesn't mean Beanie Babies are a good long term investment. 
Many of us have profited greatly off BTC, but that's no reason to get cocky and refuse to acknowledge changing tides. No investment is good forever, adapting to changing circumstances is the future, not blindly betting on the same BTC horse regardless of circumstances.

I don't understand how "low fee" and "convenient" are associated with Bitcoin. 
You know what's low fee and convenient? *Fiat currency.* I can go on Amazon right now and buy a keyboard with a **single click,** and have the purchase auto-deduct out of the zero-fee bank account that my paychecks are auto-deposited into. 
There's literally no fee and no hindrance to these fiat payments. Meanwhile with Bitcoin you have transaction fees and most store transactions take at least two steps of converting the USD price to BTC and then you sending your payment over with your order number. 
I just literally don't understand how anyone can say BTC purchases are "easier" than a payment with a fiat currency via ApplePay, PayPal, etc.

That's because most people here have put significant savings into BTC. They aren't here to debate the technology and challenges of it, they are here to try and protect their investment and keep bad publicity away. They just want the public to see positive news and for BTC to go to the moon so they can cash out and make a profit. 
Very few people actually care about the idea and promise of BTC. To them, cryptocurrency is simply horse racing, and they don't want people to spook the horse.

Western Union charges 10%? What the fuck. 
Then use Paypal, seriously.
I don't work for PayPal or anything, but why the fuck would you ever use Western Union when PayPal only charges 0.5-1% for international transfers. That's just ~$10 for your transfer of 1200 USD.
I love bitcoin, but for just $1200 transfer I'd still use paypal. I'll pay the $10 for the convenience and for not having to teach my parents in another country how to sell the bitcoin and go through that work. 
...but if I ever transfer &gt;$10,000, then yeah, Bitcoin all the way.
