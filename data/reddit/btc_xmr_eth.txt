If you look on the App website, one of the features is the ability to remotely wipe your bitcoin account via SMS if your phone were to be stolen (even if the SIM is swapped, apparently). There is also a mode where samurai is completely hidden from the home/app screens, and the only way to open it is by dialing a special code on the phone. I assume these two features are why it needs those permissions.

Just in full disclosure, I'm very biased in favor of ROTH IRAs. If you are eligible to open one, in my opinion its about the best place to put your money outside of any employer 401K Match.
The way that the ROTH IRA works, is that you can put up to $5500 into it per year. The Roth part is just the type of account, you can invest in any asset you want once it's in the account. It's a post-tax account, so unlike a traditional IRA, you can't write it off your taxes when you put money into it. Instead, however, all growth is tax free forever (in theory anyway, they could change the rules in the future). So, as an example, lets say you put 5 thousand into it this year, and in twenty years it's grown to 500,000. When you withdraw that 500,000, you do so completely tax free. It has other advantages as well, such that you can always withdraw contributions (but not growth) penalty free, and you are also allowed to pull money out for first-time home purchases penalty free.
It's technically possible to put BTC into an IRA at the moment, but its pretty convoluted (and expensive). If the ETF is approved, however, it will trade on the normal exchanges, and so you should be able to buy it through whatever brokerage you normally use for your IRA.

Well, in general you would transfer it to an exchange (e.g. Gemini, Coinbase, etc) and then sell it for USD. 10K BTC is a LOT though - around 12 million at the moment. So depending on how accurate you want your screenplay to be, I would imagine there are many more hoops to go through if you want to cash out that much at once. Someone much more well off than I will have to guide you for that, =).

No, certainly do not use that unless you know a lot more about it. They could very easily be logging all of the private keys. At a minimum you would need to download it and run it from a non Internet connected machine. But only do that if you genuinely trust the source code, as they may be using some deterministic means of generating the private keys.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:02:23
If it were me, I would continue to just buy pure BTC on an exchange. The one exception, is that I might use the ETF in something like an ROTH IRA for the tax advantages.
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:21:49
Yeah, the issue is that if you aren't familiar with the technology or the source code they are using, there may be backdoors that will allow them to sweep for any address created using it at some point in the future. 
I use a hardware wallet, so I'm not too familiar with the paper creation methods. There should be a few reference implementations of paper wallets that have been well reviewed other redditors can recommend for you. You may have a bit of trouble getting an answer today as most of the Bitcoin universe is fixated on the upcoming ETF decision. If someone doesn't come along with a better answer, I would ask again in a couple days when all this blows over.
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:59:00
Yeah, that's going to be extremely difficult. I do not know where you intend this story to go, but one option would be to track down a buyer willing to pay in cash off-market. He would have to be willing to accept a significantly reduced price, but if he were willing to sell 12 Million worth of BTC off market for 6 million (lets say, some connection he made via some online forum), I'm sure he could find a taker. It might be a neat story arc in the danger of meeting up with someone to transfer millions of dollars, =).
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:11:01
Yeah, I didn't mean to imply anything with certainty. There is certainly a chance that will occur. I just think that at this moment in time, given the zealousness of BTU supporters (several of which are very large holders, at least), the lag that BTU would have in reaching the exchanges, and the uncertainty that everyone would have - we likely shouldn't assume a massive BTU sell off is a forgone conclusion. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:17:24
Would that happen though? I mean, some of the ideological purists certainly would. But what percentage of BTC holders are in it for the money, and have no idea this is even happening? I can't see holders in that category dumping either until they know which is more valuable. On the other side of the coin, virtually all BTU supporters do so for ideological reasons, and so I would imagine a much larger portion of those holders would sell BTC. To make matter worse, wouldn't it take additional time for BTU to even be listed at first?

Hah, brilliant. Go Team!
Edit:  , I'll take your bet as well

If you are interested in the raw details, he would have to download some wallet software (e.g. Electrum, Breadwallet, etc). He would then enter the private key into the software, it would then scan and see that there are 10,000 bitcoin unlockable with that key. He would then want to transfer it to an exchange (e.g. Gemini, Coinbase, etc). To do that, he would create an account, and would be provided with a "deposit" address. He would then return to his wallet that has the private key loaded, and initiate a transfer from that wallet to the deposit address. Once on the exchange, it can be swapped for US Dollars. The issue is the amount. In general, most exchanges limit how much you can transfer out at a time. I have no idea what you would type of verification you would need to be able to transfer that type of money.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:43:33
I don't want to bring you down, but given we're talking an hour or so, I think you aren't going to have much luck. Any place that allows you to buy instantly without verification is going to have ridiculous fees because of the inherent risk of charge backs. One possible option would be to try and see if there is anyone willing to sell on localbitcoins for cash (or try to find a BTC ATM). You'll probably end up paying 15% or so premium, but that will still be less than online methods that aren't scams. I will happily stand corrected if anyone else has a better suggestion.

There is the belief among many (most?) that there is a non-zero quantity of institutional investor money (e.g. trust funds, pension funds, etc) that would like to invest in Bitcoin as a hedge against other assets, however are currently unable to as its not traded on any approved exchanges. The thought is that the ETF would give such investors an avenue to invest in BTC. There are other advantages as well, such as it makes it easier to include BTC exposure in tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401Ks. There may also be potential investors who have not yet invested in BTC because of fears of its future legal status, or concerns about the technical challenges of securing it. An ETF approval provides a sort of tacit approval from the government that investing in BTC is acceptable, and offloads some of the technical burden on the investor. Since BTC is deflationary, any ***new*** investment requires acquiring existing coins, which would thus result in upward pressure on the price.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:36:49
I did as well, but if my memory serves me, in addition to the minimum, they had pretty hefty fees - both on deposit, and annually as maintenance.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:00:41
Haha, I agree with everything you wrote, however I'm not sure Xapo is going to allow you to fill up $12M on their debit card, =). 
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:36:27
You assumed correctly. The fees are implicit in the difference between the total outputs and total inputs. So if I have 1.1 BTC with of inputs, and 1 BTC worth of outputs, the TX fee to the miner is 0.1 BTC.

I'm not an expert, but I think the problem with your analogy, is that bitcoin doesn't derive its security from the 'size of the building', but rather the amount of energy that was consumed to create the building. In other words, a proof of work system gains its secure properties as a result of the work itself, not the final product. Thus, if I reduce the work required, I've reduced the security. I don't think it would be an issue if all nodes has this optimization, as then the system would recalibrate the difficulty to compensate. 
It might help to take it to think about an extreme form of such an optimization/attack. Let's say I found a way to reduce work to a single hash, or somehow got a 98% speedup over other miners. That would allow me to create blocks significantly faster than others on the network, and would allow me to launch attacks of the 51% variety with significantly less than 51% of the actual hash power.
