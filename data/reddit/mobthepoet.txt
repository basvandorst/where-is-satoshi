Well yeah, of course it’s speculation. But it’s speculation based on history, current trends, and future projections from people that know a helluva lot more about this stuff than I do. Would I say it’s smarter to invest in bitcoin if you need to store money or need a house? No. But a vast majority of investors are looking to make money, not store it. Based on that, as of right now it is absolutely more realistic to say that bitcoin would lead to more returns in the future than a house would. 
It’s not safer than a house, and yes theoretically at some point it will level out and function just as a currency, but is that going to happen in the next 5-10 years? I’d say no. So it’s something you put money in to make more money as there’s no reason to believe as of this moment that you *won’t* make money off of a long term bitcoin investment. 
Tomorrow a $1,000,000 house will be $1,000,000. It will most likely be around that price in 5 years as well (obviously a simplification but you understand my point).
Tomorrow $1,000,000 in bitcoin *could* fall to $500,000. But in 5 years it could be worth $2,000,000, $3,000,000, $4,000,000? Who knows exactly?
Maybe it’s not technically correct to say it has “better” holding value, but it’s value will most probably improve if you hold it, where a house’s value will most likely not.

My personal philosophy is any small (1-200$$$) investment is worth hodling because the loss isn’t all that substantial. Any amount you’re ok with losing is worth investing.

This makes me confident that coin bought now has tremendous long term value. Even if BTC isn’t the eventual top coin, the fact that it’s the front runner of the crypto boom means that it’ll most likely be one of the first to hit the true mainstream, which should also mean huge increase in value.

Bitcoin’s utility is as a currency. Once the value of Bitcoin as a currency becomes cemented over time, it will see less and less growth. It’s growing right now because it’s new and still hasn’t found it’s settling point as a currency.
Same reason you don’t see the value of a US dollar fluctuating a lot. It’s found its value and stays relatively the same. Bitcoin isn’t a good or service, so it’s value is literally only determined by its backing a currency.
Did you think it could just go up forever?

Don’t predict this confidently and don’t try to tell people to buy.

If Facebook released a centralized coin system people would use it. You have to remember that cryptos are still relatively uncommon and absolutely not mainstream. If a huge company like Facebook or Google released one with added centralization it would be the first big mainstream one and honestly no amount of outcry from the crypto community would stop it.

Unless you really need the House bitcoin most likely has better holding value. Or is real estate coming back?
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:17:20
I wasn’t referring to the stability of the values, I was referring to the values themselves. $1,000,000 in bitcoin will *most likely* make you more money in the next few years than a $1,000,000 dollar house will.
You can’t determine holding value over a relatively short period when there are obvious, longer term trends which suggest the opposite of short term trends. Of course most houses won’t lose half their value in in 40 days, but when was the last time the price of a house doubled in a year?

Volatility and speculativity do not equate to neither a decrease or increase
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:06:18
It’s about people from that altcoin spreading misinformation to people that don’t know better. It just slows down progress and the ensuing arguments hurt both sides.

Which was soliciting the sale of illegal substances.
They are condoning it by allowing it.

Isn’t Bitcoin going to give me superpowers and fuck my wife too?

Unfortunately I don't think this is a problem of the consumer - it's a problem of bitcoin. This shit is really difficult to understand and it only seems to get more complicated with time. Most info graphic "simple guides" are huge monsters to process, and there's no real tutorial of sorts to tell people how to use private and public keys. 
The fact that someone can buy Bitcoin without ever encountering an explanation of how an important mechanic works is awful, and it feels like the bitcoin community *prides* itself on this kind of thing. I think once it teachers a certain point, bitcoin is going to need a reworking and the committed community isn't going to be happy about it.

Aaaaaaand it’s gone

What they do instead is a fucking crime :)

I don't know a whole lot about the specifications of how bitcoin works in terms of hardware, but I was just saying that a ~50 dollar hard drive can be just as effective as a 100 some dollar 2TB hard drive. I could be missing the mark, but I literally looked on amazon and found a 30 dollar 500gb hard disk that runs at 7200 rpm, which is a standard high speed rpm.
Basically you wouldn't be losing any recording speed from your hard drive for the "50 dollar hard drive" that the commenter was saying. Though again, I could be completely misreading the point since I'm not too knowledgeable about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:43:11
I mean, the person I responded to initially said that a 50 dollar hard drive wouldn't cut it for ethereum. I was agreeing with you in essentially saying it's not the hard drive that matters - even a common 30 dollar drive will do just fine.
Sorry for not really addressing the question that was put to me specifically 
Quick edit: Read/Write speed is *still* an important part of hard drives though. The term "read/write speed" is actually specifically for hard drives, and refers to how quickly a hard drive can either save or present data to or from itself. Digital SSDs are faster than standard spinning hard disks at loading and saving data, meaning their read/write speeds are faster. Not entirely relevant to the bitcoin discussion but just wanted to clarify!

Is there some sort of guide that will teach me how to maneuver bitcoins and about actually owning coins? I was under the impression that I could just keep my coins there and use them from Coinbase.
I don't really want to keep asking menial questions here so a guide would be really useful :)
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:50:55
I suppose this is a much more self learning curve than I originally thought. Thanks to you and to everyone for being very helpful!
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:52:40
I mean you can mock the person or you could educate them
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:46:17
As a less involved but still enthusiastic Bitcoin user, where should I move my Coinbase balances? I have the Blockchain wallet app but I just recently bought bitcoin for the first time and I'm not sure how to transfer ��
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:46:32
You can get a 30 dollar 500gb hard disk drive that reads/writes at standard high speeds. Storage for data is insanely cheap nowadays.

It’s kinda gross that any dissenting opinion gets brigaded on account of being “shilling”. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 17:40:05
It’s not really an opinion when he states it as a fact. If he wanted to back his fact though, he’d have to show some proof as to how other coins are “fundamentally” better.
If there are better coins, that isn’t an opinion. It’s a fact. Only option I could think of is ethereum though because others are too small to even consider at this point.
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:16:15
I think what he's saying is that he has so much faith in Segwit that he'll put all his money into BTC if it goes through 
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:46:47
He may be referring to fiat currency, which is money such as USD and British pounds
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:12:16
This right here. It isn’t even a question of good or bad trades, it’s just shit business. He’d be stupid to use this even if he wasn’t bad and lost all of his money.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:14:11
The problem is that there really is no quantifiable pattern to BTC. You can go off of recent price history to predict, but it isn’t a stock. It just doesn’t fluctuate in the same manner. The best bet is to just buy over time and hodl imo.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:08:56
It’s a high risk move to be sure and I wouldn’t ever suggest someone do this with anything other than personal forex trading if you’re confident
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:10:54
That’s not what he’s talking about, he’s talking about using 3rd party trade orgs to artificially leverage your own money to eat more buying power in the market.
2:1 leverage means you have double the buying power than you’re money, and your profits/losses will be roughly double. Some people trade leverages of up to 1000:1. It can be a big money move if you only go in when you’re Uber confident, but it’s a good way to lose all of your money.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:15:03
He was also obviously shorting for the long term in big numbers rather than essentially Day trading. Biggest mistake.
