It only takes a few words from somebody powerful and from somebody they trust for people to abandon ship. Example, Trump says something regulatory, reddit users post novel length FUD and shit gets hodl turns to "oh fuck"

Now HODL something going in the opposite direction until it eventually gets delisted from exchanges and tell me who wins that one. HODL something until you find out the CEO is a criminal or dies, for example. Unlikely but it's not out of the question at all.
There's risk in both and while it's simpler and less riskier to HODL, you could make a lot more money trading (not considering capital gains tax) if you do it right.

There are a bunch of young bucks who make a lot of money on the internet. The barriers are so low and while I myself was poor at 14 and still relatively am tbh, there are a lot of people who could've simply asked their parents for money. Wouldn't have worked for me but some people just have richer families. Plus if he somehow had a job at that young age it wouldn't be difficult to save that much with no bills..

That's why altcoins are the way to go if you're trying to make money right now off of short-medium term trades and a small-medium amount of money. 
Plus if 20 is all you got to start out with and you end up turning it into 40, you did pretty good for yourself. That's motivation to work harder/somewhere else and make more money to put into cryptocurrencies.
