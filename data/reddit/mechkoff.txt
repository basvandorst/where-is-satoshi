Use Local Coin Swap. It's perfect
@_date: 2018-08-19 12:51:04
It depends which generation you are talking about. For the millennials it's quite easy I guess 
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:28:19
Only upside can be seen 2019. That's for sure. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 18:59:46
I personally assume a year after the block will be reduced. Based on previous data. Let's say 2021. 
@_date: 2019-03-11 08:41:34
Do you think we had capitulation?
@_date: 2019-03-05 09:40:03
On the opposite! That's the best can happen to BTC and all of us
@_date: 2019-03-14 10:42:08
Too late for love 
@_date: 2019-03-11 06:47:44
It is worth taking. Especially now. I would invest some now and have some back money in case of final capitulation. Which I believe haven't happened yet. But keep in mind that it will take at least a year after the halving to go to ATH. May be more. And next time sell just a bit at the top. We all learning as we go. Good luck
@_date: 2019-03-14 10:36:21
Still couple of years to go 
@_date: 2019-03-11 12:04:15
Yes. Agree with you mate. No one knows. Go ahead and best of luck. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 06:38:17
Absolutely. It can be great in terms of introducing so many people to crypto. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 18:08:43
That's where we are heading
@_date: 2019-11-17 06:24:02
I used Local Coin Swap and it really works quite fine for me
@_date: 2019-03-11 08:58:44
I can suggest to wait until middle of April. There roughly the 60 days cycle ends
@_date: 2019-11-17 06:23:39
Great. Thanks man
@_date: 2018-10-24 07:39:20
A testament to the revolutionary power of nonviolence, Gandhi's approach directly influenced Martin Luther King, Jr., who argued that the Gandhian philosophy was “the only morally and practically sound method open to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom”
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:42:24
Sure. Thanks mate
@_date: 2019-11-20 15:46:42
You are awesome. Thank you very much. Cheers.
@_date: 2018-10-24 07:30:10
I still believe we are at the end of stage 3 with Bakt and Fidelity boarding on. I guess couple of years until the next halving and we will Winn 
@_date: 2019-03-10 12:25:34

Can someone please tell me what is the best way to make a paper wallet bitcoin
@_date: 2018-10-23 10:27:54
Just checked it today. It cost 600 usd to purchase 1 BTC 
@_date: 2018-10-02 07:05:35
Congratulations. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 10:46:00
I think it operates only buying
@_date: 2018-10-24 07:06:38
Yes ��
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:43:49
I love Czech beer mate. But I can pay for my beer. Thanks for your offer
@_date: 2018-10-26 13:03:41
Agree. Thank you for the meaningful comment. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 07:35:24
You can use Local Coin Swap. Works great and has many options for different types of payment
@_date: 2019-03-11 07:06:43
If we capitulate In April I will go full blast. You can buy next dip ( I usually but Cardano and BTC) sell 30_40% when the price correct after the dip. Redeem the 60,70% In Your hardwallet and leave an open order if the price dip again. It's like a hedge against lower price in the future. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 06:42:26
That's a very interesting question. I guess should be OTC but let's see the community suggestions
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:37:50
I understand that. And I support it. I just suggest that you pay a beer  for someone that has never used BTC or made a transaction. I am an old timmer. Efforts needs to be towards new people
@_date: 2018-10-27 15:45:48
I agree. Even I am from Europe

Goodbye Tether 
@_date: 2018-10-28 05:38:30
Try Local Coin Swap. You be got there many options for fiat payment plus is peer to peer and no KYC required. Works great
@_date: 2018-10-22 16:52:01
Agree. Both are :)
@_date: 2018-10-22 10:39:53
Yes I will. It's been set up last week. So far not been used. Apparently it's in a place where I buy coffee every morning so the coffee guy will report on use. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:05:22
Goodbye Tether
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:35:59

@_date: 2018-10-24 08:24:36
Excellent choice
@_date: 2018-10-24 07:50:13
You make a deal with big miners for a large amount on a certain price.

Plus the 1 mil Satoshie coins needs to be excluded as well. They will never be used in my opinion
@_date: 2019-08-26 06:10:48
Wow �� that much
@_date: 2019-08-26 07:42:10
No it doesn't. Lost coins are the one you don't have the private keys for some reason
@_date: 2019-08-26 11:35:52
Yes, sure. I will ask some tweeter guys to help me a bit :)
@_date: 2019-08-26 07:53:41
You can not prove it. But there should be some realistic rough estimate ... Right?
@_date: 2019-08-26 11:02:52
With 18 mil mined , that's really a lot.
@_date: 2019-08-26 09:17:05
Yes, that's a quite a good guess
@_date: 2019-08-26 06:00:43
Thanks a lot mate. I thought some rough number can be figured out
@_date: 2019-08-26 10:45:11
My calculations are something between 1.5 and 3 mil. Most of them lost during early days. But hope to get some help from community. Could be actually more
@_date: 2019-02-21 06:06:17
It will get you there. But will be a longer drive
@_date: 2019-08-26 06:11:23
Sorry to hear that
@_date: 2019-08-26 07:14:07
Makes sense. Thanks mate

@_date: 2019-12-22 09:46:16
Can you also sell? Or it's just one way
@_date: 2019-12-15 12:30:00
It's up to you. I just shared my opinion

@_date: 2019-12-15 12:07:53
No. Not safe. Not your keys not your coins. It will be like this always.
@_date: 2019-12-15 12:23:34
The only interest you will ever get will be by  hodling BTC.
@_date: 2019-04-12 07:26:04
No. Never.
@_date: 2019-12-15 12:00:11
But it helps you to understand what you are doing !!!
@_date: 2019-04-16 07:58:04
Big days are coming, agree. Right after the halving in 2024
@_date: 2019-04-16 08:06:36
The halving in 2020 isn't that relevant to mass adoption and growth. What was the original post. If we follow the exponential curve of adoption then the year after the halving in 2024 will be huge
@_date: 2019-04-16 09:02:37
Internet adoption started at 400 mil it wasn't complete at 400 mil
@_date: 2019-04-13 13:51:06
Correct! You only need the seed ��
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:47:39

Try Local Coin Swap. It's no KYC and works great
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:26:33
There is only two risks with investing. Loosing all your money or missing the moment. If I was you, I would go and buy. It wouldn't really matter in a long run.
@_date: 2019-04-16 08:01:36
You can try Local Coin Swap. No KYC it's peer to peer and they support hundreds of different payment methods
@_date: 2019-04-03 08:50:46
@_date: 2018-11-17 09:18:51
I think people that doesn't understand the ecosystem should at least have some time frame for their investment. You can not spend 1k and expect to turn it into �� k next morning. Just give your self couple of years and don't bother the price. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:28:22
Now is more then a great entry point. Problem is I ran out of money on the way down. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 08:50:01
Yes. Try Local Coin Swap. It's much better than Local Bitcoind. 
@_date: 2018-11-04 17:19:52
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:24:43
Nothing unusual. But it's a great opportunity for people as an entry point.

Local Coin Swap. Peer to peer exchange and community owed. Much better the Local Bitcoins 
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:37:18
Same here mate. I even started to love the dips. And usually buying when the red shows -30% in some altcoins. I only regret for people that hurry to sell.

Anybody has an idea how the price of BTC will reflect on inflation? 
@_date: 2019-01-22 06:03:31
Rewards halving into 2BTC per block in 2020 ? I guess it was a sport journalist who written this article. How come this people are not even little educated about the topics they write. And so many people are reading shit all around the web and suddenly all become experts. And they all have opinion. Opinion on a bull market, on a �� market, on cycles, on price. 
If you don't know why some asset has a price in a first place, how come you know that is worthless or how much will be in future

Most of people a price driven which created and will create speculation bubbles. But fundamentals are becoming stronger with every day.

@_date: 2018-12-06 19:12:45
Bloomberg are great. I really like them. Whatever they say should be looked the other way around. If they say 25k by the end of the year, that pretty much means sell asap. If the now say bottom is at 1500 that's quite a good buy signal. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 15:10:40
You can also use Local Coin Swap. In my opinion work much better and has more payment options
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:13:48

@_date: 2018-12-16 12:01:13
I hope you are right. But in my opinion is not the bottom and it's not the end of the �� market. I guess there is still a lot of money �� to be shifted from altprojects that are vaporing into BTC. And you need few more shakes in order to happen. That's what I feel. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 12:56:47
Ha ha ��. May be it will go below 0 ��
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:39:22

What makes you think that is happening? 
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:49:14
No mate. Local Coin Swap doesn't have KYC. It's peer to peer and has many fiat to crypto bridges. It's not local Bitcoin. Don't mistake it
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:36:24
Many of us does. Trust me. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:07:44
Capitulation will be at around 2k. Unfortunately never thought we may get there , but obviously we are on the way. The most important I guess is not to sell. I always say to my self: They want YOUR coins ��
@_date: 2018-12-16 11:42:51
Yes. Thanks for sharing it 
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:13:00
Because of CME ?
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:25:25
Why would you buy in the first place if you don't know what to do with it
@_date: 2018-12-02 12:08:07
No. 10 mil one year after the 3rd halving.
