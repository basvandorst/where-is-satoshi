Do some reading, start with stuff in the side bar ---&gt;
TL;DR is: mining difficulty has gone up so much that unless you have free electricity, you'll spend more on elec than you'll make from the BTC you mine. Even with free electricity, it's not guaranteed at this point that you'd make much.

Come back and post again once you understand what Bitcoin is. Your ignorance is showing big-style right now.
For example:
- "Bitcoin is a scam" 
No, it's a peer-to-peer payment system and digital currency which is open source, which has been checked by many eyes (and will be in the future) for security, for flaws, etc. 
- "A fucking hacker can literally sit on his ass right now and take all of your money".
No, a 'fucking hacker' can sit on his ass and spend quite literally billions of years trying to guess the private key to my paper wallet. Good luck to the 'fucking hacker' here. 
Btw, do you blame 'the dollar' whenever someone gets robbed by a confidence trickster?
- "Currently crypto is b.s. because investors only care about their pockets not the actual currency itself as opposed to a stock where you buy based on earning calls and announcements etc... bitcoin buys and sells are erratic."
How long have you been a successful mind-reader?
- "dogecoin is well a fucking dog"
No, Dogecoin is a peer-to-peer payment system and digital currency which is open source. I think we've covered this idea already.
- "We need something safe and secure and if we have to build it from the ground up so be it."
Yeah, roll-your-own is a brilliant strategy which has never lead to any problems or flaws, particularly in the area of security/cryptography and cryptocurrencies.
- "This website grows exponentially and with its growth and influence on general populace we can spread the word, slowly but surely."

Properly random selection from a good dict (use a dice if you like) is a good method.
You could try hotbits for a service that gives you atomically generated randomness. 
That said, a dice in your own hand is pretty unbeatable for known randomness (if not loaded).
And the disadvantage of hotbits is that it's online and so the traffic could be snooped or theoretically used by someone at hotbits.

You are comparing Gavin trusting CW with the person you are replying to trusting what many in the community have verified, while showing their working.

He's not relying on the others' authority. They've shown their working. Their steps can be reproduced. They've not called each other out on problems in their working, as far as I've seen. 
To believe all these people are in cahoots to fool OP or others, you'd have to believe there was a conspiracy.

Bitcoin is a decentralised cryptocurrency. There are no banks, no controlling bodies. If you allowed chargebacks, you then end up with the question "On whose authority would a chargeback be made?" Do we end up by just listening to "both sides" and then the bitcoin network users somehow decide? How are you going to stop chargebacks being used dishonestly? Who would arbitrate?
Allowing chargebacks in a system like Bitcoin would get messy really really fast. It's just not practical. 
You're not protected by banks here, you're protected by hard mathematical facts. Maths can't prevent human users being sloppy and making human errors though.

Bitcoin public/private keypairs are protected by two cryptographic hashing functions. Once you send btc from an address, your public key is made public information, and in theory only one hashing function is still in effect.

The coinbase wallet is an online wallet. I and many others regard online wallets as dangerous because at least two online wallet websites recently got all their btc stolen; it may even have been the site operators running off with the btc.
The safest place for your wallet is in your own possession, not on some webserver of an unknown party. 
You can't open the coinbase wallet from your own client. But Coinbase may offer you the option to send your bitcoin from their online wallet to another address. If this is the case, send the amount to a public address that you have generated in your client.

This. The deterministic seed is the really cool thing about electrum. One backup needed only for all time.
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:33:03
1) In order to understand bitcoin properly, know that bitcoins actually live in the blockchain, not in your wallet. Your wallets contains public+private keypairs which give you the right to send certain bitcoins in the blockchain to other addresses.
So, yes, you can send your btc to another address if you get there first (before the thief transfers them).
2) Depends on the kind of wallet. In Electrum client you can make a deterministic wallet from a seed phrase. This means you only have to back up the seed phrase and nothing else. By running the Electrum client elsewhere and putting in the same seed phrase, you will see your addresses and btc. The btc balances are fetched from the blockchain where they live.
Most other client software doesn't have this seed feature, and so they won't necessarily "sync up" wallets in the way you're hoping for (like Electrum does).
3) Yes, all but one of your transfer attempts should fail, due to the double spending checking.
Remember, btc actually live in the blockchain not the wallet. The wallet is just the details of your public addresses PLUS the authorisation for you to send those btc to other addresses (i.e. the private key).

What do you mean by "the price"? You mean the amount you could get for your btc?
No matter, it's still just bitcoins in the blockchain. What you've actually done is move the information about the public and private address(es) from an exchange into your own wallet.
Technically speaking, bitcoins exist as numbers in the blockchain, and nowhere else. Wallets and exchanges just contain the 'secret' private key that allows someone to send bitcoins with a given public address elsewhere.

@_date: 2013-12-23 11:27:51
There's no such thing as "an individual bitcoin" or "an individual bitcoin amount". The blockchain keeps track of numbers representing bitcoin amounts. As long as the numbers going into a transaction add up to the same amount as the sum of numbers going out of a transaction, it's valid.
Put it another way: if you have 1 bitcoin at an address, then I send you 1 more btc to the same address, you now have two bitcoins. 1 + 1 = 2. It's impossible to say what part of that 2 is "my" bitcoin or not - it's not defined. If you now sent 1btc from your address somewhere else, you can't say "That's the bitcoin brosnoids sent me!". it's just 1btc that you have the right to send.

Yes, Bitcoin supports m of n transactions. I suggested this very idea recently.
You'd want, say, 7 of 10.
To select the 10 people, everyone interested in being one of the ten volunteers themself. Once volunteering is closed, you use some unknowable-in-advance data from the blockchain the next day or week to pull out your 10 people (and this algorithm is published in advance).
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:25:33
Buyer provides a public crypto key to you. You encrypt source using it. Send encrypted source to escrow, who sends it on the buyer. This way, escrow cannot get at the source, and the buyer can.
You still have potential problem that buyer lies and says "That encrypted data isn't what I expected! It's gifs of bewbs!"
Ultimately, there has to be the option for dispute and dispute resolution.
This is a tricky problem because even if the source is open to the escrow, they probably don't have the skills or interest to know if it's the source for the agreed item.
If this kind of escrow is a biiig deal, a way of doing it is:
1) buyer sends btc payment to escrow
2) buyer, you, and escrow meet in a place that escrow has set up. Buyer has access to a computer containing the source, without abililty to send the source anywhere or walk off with it. Buyer gets to play with source and satisfy themselves it does what they want within a time frame (e.g. 8 hours)
3) If buyer is satisfied, escrow allows btc-for-source exchange to happen

Erm, the site said something like 3 or 4 bitcoin in pot so far (I notice that text is now gone), but that wallet only shows 0.05 in the pot. What gives?
How does the winner know the stated amount in the pot is the real figure? I think more transparency would be good here. For example, you could publish your incoming address for entries. The person's guess could be a comment on the transaction. Then the winner has their winnings sent back to their address used to enter the comp. and because the entry address is public info, anyone can see how many people entered.

Key concept you need to understand: Bitcoins only exist in the blockchain. Your wallet is actually just recording public+private address pairs, nothing else. The only reason Electrum can show address balances is that it asks the blockchain for balances.
Also, the blockchain has no idea which addresses belong in wallets or which addresses are in the same wallet - the blockchain doesn't even have a concept of wallet.
Therefore, even transactions between just addresses in one wallet go out to the blockchain. And you need to provide some sort of transaction fee.

Free advice for anyone reading this:
Ways to help avoid getting trojans/viruses:
* Don't use windows
* If you do use windows, use anti-virus software with live protection
* Be extremely suspicious of opening/saving email attachments or opening links in emails
* Know that even emails that appear to be from people you know might be spam/viruses sent after their email account was compromised
* Consider using gmail for your email. Google's spam and crap filtering it pretty amazing -- I've not had to wade through spam for years now. Can't remember the last time a dodgy looking attachment ended up in my inbox either.
* Use Google's free DNS service. This blocks some known dodgy IPs from being opened by you. For more info see

*do not use brainwallet passphrases*. It's a terrible idea. If people were good at choosing good passphrases, then no probs. But they're not. Generating a truly random private address is more secure. I think the only good advice about brainwallet passphrases is not to use them.
Some people are now brainwallet mining, because so many folk are using shitty passphrases.

I do wonder about this also. It seems any serious volume of business done via bitcoin would be an insane risk at the minute.

If the words are chosen truly randomly, then no, guessing the correct words and order of words isn't easy at all.
For 12 words to have 128 bits of entropy, each word needs 10.666... bits of entropy. So basically if each word were chosen from a pool of only approx 2^10 = 1024 words, that gives you about 128 bits entropy.
If a human chooses a really bad combo of words, e.g. a song lyric or line from a book, it's much easier for people to crack using culture dicts.

@_date: 2013-11-21 03:45:43
Yes, you don't have to send all of the btc from an address - you can send half of it, say. As you've noted, once you send money from an address, it in theory is slightly compromised because the public key (which the public address is a hash of) is now public. 
Some software automatically helps you send any remaining amount to a "change address", so nothing remains in the theoretically-now-slightly-compromised address.
A practical consideration for sending only part of the btc from a paper wallet address is the fact that you may have broken a tamper-proof seal on the wallet to get the private address. So you need to be able to reseal the private key part again.

And why should exchanges accept unquestioningly the conclusions/work of the druggies chasing their btc? It could be flawed. Exchanges would have to spend time/money verifying the results. Don't see it happening. Nothing to see here, move along.

You can't really find out their location. That's part of the whole Bitcoin thing, didn't you get the memo? Unreversible transactions and relative anonymity.

Why would you expose your valuable btc to potential attack?
Even with best intentions, there may be security holes in it, or bugs that cause btc loss.

I mean 'let them off with the mistake', not 'let them have your cash for nothing'. derp.

Once it broke $400 barrier, it rocketed through. Don't be so impatient! The current price seems to be pretty well supported by people looking to buy in at a reduced price.

Ok, as long as you understand you're going to lose money doing it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:31:50
It's as safe as you are, pretty much. If there's a weak point, it's usually the human operating the wallet, not the wallet.
Ways to lose your money include:
* Running sensitive wallet ops on a Windows OS
* Losing unencrypted wallet backup e.g. on a USB key
* Not backing up your wallet or wallet seed (electrum)
* Using a rubbish brainwallet password
* Not understand change addresses and losing change
* Poor security for other services. Use 2FA for your gmail account and sites like localbitcoins.com!
etc. etc.
Basically, you are the weak point, not Electrum.
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:04:16
YA Coinbase thread. 
This is why I take extra markup of using localbitcoins when I bought in. Yes, it was more expensive, but I did know what price I was getting.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:27:33
If you think that address is compromised, make a paper-based wallet and move what's left from your address to the paper based wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:11:56
Moving a decimal place three places is hard? You've got bigger problems than mBTC being used.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:32:12
Don't forget localbitcoins take a cut too.
@_date: 2013-12-13 09:03:21
Changing basic units ("bitcoin") is silly and will only cause confusion. A new word for mbtc makes more sense.

I'm hoping a few years down the road that they finally twig on to Bitcoin and realise they abused the guy trying to give them $100 of BTC which would by then be worth &gt;9000 internets...

I'm thinking Localbitcoins.com for selling. Possibly in person using cash.

They're not tracking the dirty coins so they can make a blacklist. They're more interested in catching/identifying the robber(s).

Online transactions only so far. Not been scammed or had any funny business so far (but only buying so far).

You need to stop focusing on the negative thoughts if possible. Yes, you could have made shitloads of money. So could I. I wish I had bought shitloads of coins in 2010 or even Jan this year, but I didn't. That's that.
Might I suggest you look into cognitive behavioural therapy? It's useful to addressing destructive thought patterns and thought habits.
As others have said, you (probably) have your health. When all is done and said, health is number 1.

Hi Jeff,
Sorry for my over-arching cynicism. It's just that there are so many scam sites, when I see a site without any identifying company information or contact details or real names, I'm immediately suspicious.
Good luck with your venture!

See the second section here:
As it says, Electrum and Armory allow you to have an online 'watching only' wallet. 
I use Electrum and quite like it.

It doesn't mean that you can't use windows for regular stuff. But when you're doing bitcoin wallet stuff, steer clear of windows. Use either a different OS, or boot your windows machine in Linux using a LiveDVD (e.g. Ubuntu).
Scanning your windows machine for viruses etc. and finding nothing *doesn't* mean your machine is clean. In this case, it probably wasn't. New viruses and trojans are coming out all the time, and it takes time for vendors to catch up with them. And a lot of viruses/trojans are coming out right now that target bitcoin.
I'm considering buying a Trezor when they come out - I think it's $200 for a device that in theory means your PC can't get at the private key, even if it's trojaned up to the 9s.

Day trading is not a great idea in Bitcoin IMO. Doubly so if you don't know enough about Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is very volatile and the delay between market movements and executing a move is not acceptable IMO. The surge in interest in BTC and the newness of it makes for some unpredictable infrastucture (e.g. exchange sites going down at peak times, etc).
You'd be safer off putting some money in (only money you could afford losing mind you) and sitting on it for a year or two. Even that's not guaranteed, natch; you could end up with not much left this way too.

Double check that the address you sent to isn't a change address in multibit, or something along those lines. If it's truly an address that you have nothing to do with, then yes you're pretty much screwed.

"We all know this version of btc cannot possibly be the endgame. But, hey, who knows?"

Don't risk important everyday life money (that you need for rent, utillities, etc.) by putting it in Bitcoin. It would be a pretty silly thing to do.
