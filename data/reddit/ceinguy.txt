Yup it's completely stupid: exchanges have limits, for example Coinbase  has max 50 000 EUR daily withdrawal limit for me.  But if I cash 3 m EUR doing 60 times 50 K EUR tx, then it'll be called structuring.
Then why the f---- don't you just let me withdraw 3 m EUR at once!?
It's politicians coming up with fucking laws all over again: we put limits, but dare to respect the limits and we'll find a way to consider you're a frauder because you respected the limits.
Then make the fucking limits 10000 USD at once max and no more than 10 times a year or whatever... But don't come call "structuring" people respecting the very fucking limits you imposed, you crooks.
Fuck the state. Just fucking fuck it.

Can't you connect your Trezor to the "Electrum" software wallet and do that? (no need to compromise your seed or anything).  Electrum can be used for sure with the Ledger Nano S hardware wallet.
Don't know if it allows you to do what you want to do but may be worth looking into.

Yup, they're called "checkpoints".  A "checkpoint" in the BTC codebase is just that.
Here are some for you, at various blocks:
        ( 11111, uint256("0x0000000069e244f73d78e8fd29ba2fd2ed618bd6fa2ee92559f542fdb26e7c1d"))

So get a life, loser because I do know what I know and what I don't (which is why I'm asking question).
And just in case you want to nitpick that a "checkpoint ain't a checksum", then you're all wrong too. The checkpoint is a cryptographic hash, and, as per Wikipedia:
_"They (cryptographic hashes) can also be used as ordinary hash functions, to index data in hash tables, for fingerprinting, to detect duplicate data or uniquely identify files, and as checksums to detect data corruption. "_
Eat it, really bro. Just eat it.
Now in case you want to actually answer, feel free to do so. But don't waste other people's time.

My best is: most of these largest wallet were still belonging to exactly the same people, but they moved their funds to other addresses, for a variety of reasons.

I'm trading crypto since years to make more BTCs but I'm no real trader and no finance guru.
My one concern is that we'll end up with 100x more "paper Bitcoin" then real Bitcoin and that all these Wall Street products will manipulate the value of the real Bitcoin.
For all I know goldbugs (which I'm also) do complain since years and years and years that the amount of fake / paper gold, non backed by real gold at all, is the one deciding the real value of gold because there's like 100x the actual gold supply (don't know the real numbers).
So +1, is this a concern at all for Bitcoin now that Wall Street is coming?

There are of course ppl doing arb but...  How did you like your arb when you had 100 BTC at Mt Gox (say instead of GDAX) and Mt Gox then goes all willy bot on you then "we got our coins stolen" and reimburses you at 1/4th of the price of BTC today and we're now 4 years later and BTC is worth 16x more or something like that? (so basically you got ripped off by something insane like x60).
That's the "counterparty risk".
First thing you're missing is the huge, gigantic, counterparty risk.
Also note that GDAX in the US is insured per account, up to 250 K USD per account, not 1.6 m.  So your BTCs ain't safe ("you don't control the private key(s), they're not your coins") and your USD neither.  On neither exchange.
Then... Imagine the gap doesn't close: if it's always quite higher on GDAX.  What you gonna do now?  "Just" move 1.6m USD from GDAX to Kraken, in a day?
You plan to do that hundreds of times a year?
How's banks going to like these?  How the IRS going to like this?  How are you going to compute what you owe in taxes?

As the other have commented: if you're in the EU you should know that fiscal laws ain't supra-nationals but national (and even in a single country, you can have, depending on the country, quite some variation between different regions of that country).
In any case when taxes are due and *if* they are due (which is really not the case in many EU countries), it's typically on realized gains. You didn't sell your Bitcoins, there are no realized gains. No taxes to pay whatsoever.

As I believe that "BTC you don't control aren't yours", nearly all my BTCs were on wallets I did control. So I got the BCHs for free.  No need to do *anything*.  Just HODL both in case the "cashening" were to happen and I was hedged.  Same for ETH: bought in at the very beginning, at tinier than tiny amount... Was enough to be hedged should the flippening happen.
What I don't get is: where were your BTC you bought @ $24 in 2013? On an exchange which didn't credit you your BCH?
And why sell them all?  If you believe BCH can "win", you just need to sell part of your BTC to be hedged should the cashening happen.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:28:05
2009-2011 were the very first adopters.  2013 pre Gox is still early. Heck, 2013 post Gox @ 230 USD were still early adopters.
I'm pretty sure the Mt Gox splash was in 2013 because I entered very early, months before the Mt Gox crash and I'm nearly sure this was 2013.  Maybe late 2012 but I don't think so.
Back then nobody: none of my quant friends, nobody, ever talked about Bitcoin.  People started talking about it during the Mt Gox / willy bot pump: when it went to 1300 USD or so.  That was the first time media started talking about Bitcoin everywhere and is probably the first time _some_ finance guys learned about it.
Before that people talking about Bitcoin were on some forums, like the 2+2 poker forums (which is where I learned about it).
I'm sorry mate, but I got in in BTC pre Gox and in ETH presale. I'm an early adopter.  Finance guys totally missed the boat back then.
But I'll leave you the last word on this. Cya.

They want to audit people who bought over 20 K between 2013 and 2015.
Us people who did that made 7 digits figure. They're going after the easy targets where lots of taxes are due in case people decide to sell.
Thankfully I'm in that case but... Not from the US and not from a country with taxes on Bitcoin gains.
If you bought 20 K in Bitcoin recently, you're gains, if realized, are pocket changes compared to those who bought during the time where Bitcoin stagnated around 230 USD or so.
If you're from the US (which apparently you are) and if you bought for 20 K USD or more during 2013 / 2015, then you're probably among the 14 000 accounts who were transmitted to the IRS.
Note that all the HODLers who didn't sell still owe exactly zero taxes and there's very probably a huge number of these 14 000 accounts who owe just that so far to uncle sam: zero (which I think is the exact number it deserves, but that is another topic ; )

He's correct that many exchanges have allowed people to short sell bitcoins since years.
You may be the one confused, thinking short sale of a futures contract is the only type of short selling? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:15:51
Nope that is totally wrong, they're still not safe.  There's at least one trading bot or "helper" out there that was reasonably successful and when sufficiently enough people were using it, all with "withdrawal disabled" (wrongly thinking they were safe), the trading/helper went rogue and made _all_ the users purchase a complete shitcoin at a totally pumped price.
Give me an API with withdrawals disabled but trading enabled, and I'll find a way to empty your account.
BTW for this very reason several exchanges allows to put the API key in "read only" (with both withdrawals *AND* trading disabled).

There's no inheritance tax on something already in your name. You can't sell it atm but it's already yours.
I don't know about real estate but if you're a fiscal resident in the US you're supposed to declare all you bank accounts. How are you going to sell that real estate? I mean: where are you going to first wire the money? Because it has to be in an european bank. And that european bank _must_ transmit all the infos they have to the IRS. Do you already have a bank account in europe? Did you tell your bank you were a US fiscal resident?
You have to check with a lawyer specialized in these matters. The ones bank provide to their rich clients tend to know about these topics ; )
Besides that: just keep that real estate an become an evil landlord!

Several ppl in Cyprus and Greece if I'm not mistaken got quite a haircut on their savings at the bank not long ago. And it's even a thing at the EU level: there's a procedure in place to "bail in" banks (that is: using ppl's account money to prevent the bank from failing).
People in Venezuela are also enjoying a lot the money they have safe at the bank, except that it's hardly worth anything anymore.
Now you're correct: it's a major PITA to be in control of your coins. To be your own bank. Thankfully the landscape is looking better and better by the day: hardware wallets makes hack way harder to pull off. No people have to scam people out of their coins because using a 0-day to hack into a computer just ain't cutting it anymore to access coins stored in a hardware wallet.
**EDIT** also I just realized: the money I have at the bank may be "safer" but it certainly didn't bring me +5000% return over two years. Let me check: no, I didn't make more than x50 on my EUR in my bank account since two years : )
**EDIT 2** My stepmom, because she was sharing a family name with someone who owned money a lot of money to the local IRS, got her bank account frozen by mistake for weeks. Bankers weren't even legally allowed to tell her why she couldn't withdraw money. Being your own bank may suck in some ways, but you're certainly giving a big middle fingers to bankers and/or to the state.

I did re-turn the lock on: tried it just to report here.
It's not normal that unprotected account can be drained so fast but... 
Please do turn on 2FA. Do turn on global lock (even if it's a major pain in the arse), etc.

Anyone who has your 2FA seed (QR code or "letters+numbers") can initialize its own auth app with your 2FA.

I'm on Polo since 2014 or so... They've often had extended periods where their showed thier sheer incompetency when it comes to reliability, communication and customer support.
Now on a good day they're making millions in fees alone I think: that's enough money yearly to not want to screw your customers.
Poloniex has to be one the most valuable privately owned company on earth: reminds me of PokerStars in a way, a private company which ended selling for billions.
Being a US citizen, last think Tristan D'agosta (Polo's founder and owner AFAICT) wants his to go in a federal pound-me-in-the-arse prison for the rest of his days. I'm certain he prefers enjoying fine champagne and fancy yachtes with the insane amount his company is raking in fees daily.
Now maybe they got or are going to get hacked or maybe their incompetency shall lead them to losing customer funds: who knows!?

@_date: 2017-08-27 19:01:33
It totally and definitely sucks balls. Especially seen that there are many countries which have 0% tax on, say, capital gains and/or FOREX gains.
0% tax on capital and FOREX gains makes a lot of sense btw: many put money their earned working, after they paid their income tax, into BTC. Why is that money taxed again?
In my country cryptocurrencies are considered currencies: you can legally use them to pay. And there's 0% on FOREX gains. If I've got CHF and the EUR falls 30% in one day vs the EUR (which happened not long ago, when Switzerland removed the peg), I don't have to pay anything to my local IRS. Same when Bitcoin go up.
I'd add that if only for the burden that it represents (calculating how much you have to pay, which is not trivial at all) it's not a fair tax either.
BTW: the genesis block of Bitcoin contains a pretty revolutionary statement, which I take you've got a problem with.

I found Bitcoin by myself one day in 2011, on a forum about online gambling. I started reading on it, got super excited.  I wish I had put all my online poker winnings in it...  Like I said I would in a fraking email I sent to my bro that very day in 2011.  But then I procrastrinated and didn't do it. FML.
Thankfully I entered in 2014 and I'm doing very fine (both on BTC and several alts on which I got in early, like ETH).

Ideally yes. That's what I was doing at the beginning: religiously moving out all my BTCs out of Polo at the end of each trading day.
But now that I made a lot I don't bother anymore: I let at most 10% of my crypto belongings on exchanges, spread over several exchanges. While my main warchest stays on hardware wallets.
Also Bittrex 100 BTC daily withdrawal limits: much love : )
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:37:24


Yup this makes no sense at all whatsoever.
The craziest thing is that several are going to jump to your throat with some "it's your fault" mixed with some schadenfreude.
A password reset should lock the funds for days. An email address change should lock the funds for days.
Some exchanges allows to do something kinda similar: make any important change start a 72 hours "freeze" process during which the settings aren't modified yet, leaving the real owner the possibility to stop the bad buy from owning the account. Don't remember which exchange (too tired to check atm but I'm 100% positive I turned that on on at least one exchange).
No words of wisdom: you're not seeing things. The entire ecosystem reeks of amateurism hidden behind PR talk.
I hope these weren't all your crypto belongings mate!
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:06:44
+1 but... Another problem is the fear it causes. I've got quite some in crypto and I'm selling some for fiat on Coinbase, both to trade fiat/crypto but also to lock some profits in fiat. The problem I have (and I sure at least some others too) is that I know that should any shit happen, I *fear* it'd be a major PITA to get someone from Coinbase to actually help.
So for me atm it's "so far so good" and I thank them for their service.
But it'd be great if I wasn't always living with the following risk: "EUR not on your bank account aren't yours" (and BTC too but at least BTC you can withdraw easily even though their lame ass daily BTC withdrawal limits do suck big fat ball).
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:30:35

I still have about 6 K USD there... I log in once each blue moon to verify my balance. I've 10x that amount at Bittrex and 5x that amount at Poloniex (and, no, don't worry for me: the real stuff is on Ledger Nano S: this is stuff I need to trade and can lose).
Last time I tried to trade there orders took 15 seconds to confirm !?
It's a shame. A complete shame.
As a result Kraken is seeing zero of my trades now: jack shit. Nada. Zilch.
I voted with my money and, dear tentacled friend, I voted you out and I tell to anyone reading this: OP is 100% correct, Kraken atm suck and you really shouldn't get there.
Never go to this exchange.
I'll only advice people to go there once:
they'll get their shit together
they'll explain what went on and apologize for the mediocre experience
P.S : just to show I'm not anti-Kraken only: it's insane that Poloniex can be laughing all the way to the bank with millions they rake in fees *daily* yet provide close to zero official statements and social media presence. It's plain maddening.  So don't go to Poloniex either: they suck fat balls too.

Bittrex's (latest [*]) official statement says that they'll do their best to credit 2X coins to those holdings BTC _on Bittrex_ but don't say when. They also say they _may_ open new trading pairs using 2X (not a guaranteed). And they say they'll disable deposits/withdrawals approx. 24 hours before the fork.
The only exchange so far that says they'll credit the 2X coins immediately is Coinbase/GDAX but on Coinbase/GDAX trading shall be disabled 4 hours before and resume 4 hours after the fork.
So many people who'll want to dump 2x shall start dumping on Coinbase/GDAX when Coinbase/GDAX resumes trading _and_ opens the 2X trading pairs (B2X/BTC, B2X/USD, ... no idea), 4 hours after the fork.
It's nearly guaranteed this shall happen before any 2X action on Bittrex.
In addition to that other exchanges may be quicker than GDAX in giving people access to their 2X coins.
[*] It seems "posh" to change your stance on 2X and emit new statements every next day or so Bittrex may, too (like Trezor, Coinbase/GDAX and so many others), change their tune in the coming days.

On exchanges it's the first price at which a sell meets a buy but... Often during the very first minutes you see crazy things, like people selling 0.0001 ZEC for 3000 BTC / ZEC and someone actually buying that 0.0001 at that price.
Now for segwit2x there are already exchanges allowing to trade futures, which at least give an idea as to what the starting price could be (you'd have to google: I haven't followed that lately).

Well people who cannot legally buy, say, a property using crypto-currencies (which is the case in many countries) are going to consider "real money" the money with which they can buy a property.
Or the money they have to use to pay their taxes.
I hate quantitative easing, I had the chancellor on the brink of second bailout, I hate empty Fort-Knox...
And I have more in Bitcoin than 99.5% (a guesstimate) in this sub so it's not as I didn't have skin in this game, but right now I've got a yearly property tax to pay and I'll be forced to use "real money" to pay it.

Ah ah: I didn't say my country didn't have any tax on all capital gains. I said my country had no taxes when trading currencies. An an EU court ruled for the entire EU that cryptos are currencies. So the EU decision makes crypto currencies, than national law on currencies gain (and losses) apply. If I buy USD with my EUR then sell them later on and make more EUR, I'm not taxed on that gain. Same with cryptos. There are several countries in the EU like that, including Malta and Belgium if I'm not mistaken.
Also I'm pretty sure there are countries without any tax at all on capital gain whatsoever: maybe Monaco, Singapour, Cayman Island, ...
I have a friend who went to live in Monaco (rent he pays is 10 K EUR / month for a two bedroom appartment that said): I'll ask him about capital gains taxes there.

Yup. This is the absolute worst.  Poloniex does that too: close to zero communication.  Poloniex saw obvious manipulation on 15 alts that then got delisted (or 13 or 17, don't remember): not a word.  Someone obviously knew and coordinated a pump and dump before the delisting: not a word.  They suddenly removed the Poloniex "trollbox", which was a way to "talk" to the company moderators could help with tickets / stuck/pending withdrawals: not a word either. It was an entire community, were online friendships were made, and they pulled the plug without any warning (I lost touch with many fellow traders when that happened).
I think there are new exchanges coming, including altcoin.io, which have been developped with traders and for traders and who do put emphasis on the fact that they'll communicate.
You may not like, say, Coinbase, but at least Coinbase has a social presence: heck, I even saw that the CEO was sometime commenting on Reddit. Same for Vaultoro, Ledger and I don't know how many other players.
But in this day and age of social media, raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions per day in fee and having no communication at all?
It's not acceptable.
So newcomers: don't accept that. Do not go to Kraken. Do not go to Poloniex.

Counterparty risk: an exchange goes rogue or kaboom, you can kiss goodbye to your coins (or receive 1/4th of the price settled at it's all time low, and then have the owner cash in hundreds of millions: like just happened with Mt Gox / Karpeles).
Risk of SNAFU'ing when doing BTC movement: you control your own money.  If you send your BTCs to a wrong address (ie an address with a correct checksum, so looking valid, but which is not the intended recipient), you may lose them all (well, all of that one transfer).
Risk of having malware modify your Bitcoin deposit/withdrawal addresses.
Risk of getting caught on the wrong side of a trade if you didn't put stop-loss in place. I saw someone lose 700 BTC on Poloniex 18 months ago (?) or so in real-time trying to short ETH during it's mad rally which triggered a cascade of margin calls on shorters.
There's also a huge opportunity cost if you don't understand how to have you BTC transactions included in the next block, by paying huge fees if needed. These last days I made a killing on BTC/BCH, paying as much as nearly 700 satoshis/byte and always got my conf in the next BTC block, while most noobs were crying here that their tx were "stuck".
Now if you're at ease with tech, if you can control emotions, if can do technical analysis, if you know how to "shuffle coins around", etc.
Well, there are fortunes to be made?
Now, long story short and although this forum doesn't like Coinbase/GDAX very much, easiest and safest if you want to simply day trade BTC/USD is probably to open an account on Coinbase/GDAX and do all your trading on Coinbase's GDAX exchange.

Say I've got the equivalent of 400 BTC in crypto and I want to trade alts. Putting 5% of these 400 BTC on an exchange ain't totally crazy.
I try to never let more than 5% on any single exchange although at time after crazy pumps I went above that. For example I had a huge Sia bag back from when Sia was one of the very last alt to pump although nearly all of them had already pumped, so I loaded waiting for a pump: and when Sia pumped, suddenly I had like 8% of my "net crypto worth" on Poloniex (not a safe place to be IMHO) and it took a while to reduce my counterparty risk because I kept hitting daily withdrawals limits.

It's not news: since BTC started rising several wrote that BTC would be able to pay back everybody (stupid settlement in fiat with no recourse in case price would do 10x)...
And it's much worse than that: he's now in a position to completely crash the BTC price... Again.

Of course there is. The Ledger Nano S uses BIP-39 / BIP-32 / BIP-44 type seeds / hierarchical deterministic wallets and they work by having pairs of master public keys and master private keys.
The list of 24 words (if you take 24 words) is itself a 256 bit number with a checksum. And that 256 bit number is pretty much a master private key, from which you can derive any public and private key.
The BIP-32 doc even has a section called "Master Key Generation".
So you're pretty much... Completely wrong?

No need for a reward for me as I've got huge bags too (and lots on Bittrex too) but...
If you're either rich or crypto rich (or both)... I mean: if these 21 BTCs are not your entire life savings, then lawyer up.
I wouldn't hesitate: the second they do that to me, I go to the fanciest fiscal lawyer in my hometown and have him send a letter to Bittrex asking them to give me access to my coins immediately or this would go to court and I'd ask for compensations, my lawyer fees paid for, etc.
They do that to my account and I lawyer up if they don't get their shit in a hurry (as in: I leave them a few days before they have to call their own lawyers).

I think he was asking why you were willing to pay a "tax" of 16% to move money around.  I mean: I certainly did move a *lot* of BTCs these last days (to trade) and I paid up to 12 or even 17 USD per tx (honestly don't remember), but these were tiny percentage of the amounts I was moving.
Paying $8 to move $50 may just seem like bad money management to many.

As I wrote: the "easy" route is to decide to simply day trade or swing trade BTC/USD or BTC/EUR... For example if you're already experienced in stock of FOREX trading: then just opening an account on Coinbase/GDAX and trading on their GDAX exchange may be an easy way to get your feet wet.
But if you plan to trade that and also other cryptos, then you'll need account on several exchanges, understand how to coins around, etc.
But, yeah, I do this full time since two years now... It's quite crazy, exhausting (markets are 24/7 and there's already a dull moment: I mean, there are some times were everything goes sideways for days or even weeks, but lately it's been getting really rare) but also exciting and it can be rewarding.

What I still don't understand if what are the security threat models for the Nano S. For example: can a rogue Chrome app (or rogue Electrum) somehow make the Nano S leak the private key?
Or this one: can a rogue "Nano app" (the ones you install using the Ledger Manager on your Nano S) steal your private keys in any way?
One thing I don't like: Ledger (the ones who make the Nano S) are forced to come up with new Nano S apps all the time to keep with latest development (say Segwit support) for various cryptocurrencies... So you're basically forced to upgrade your "Nano apps" kinda regularly.
What if a rogue employee puts a backdoor in, say, the Komodo (KMD) Nano S app? Can he steal the KMD private key?
Can he steal the master private key protecting all the cryptocurrencies?
I could ask in the Ledger sub as the CTO is very active there but I can't bug him all the time.
I'd like to see a detailed blog post on the actual threat models affecting these devices.
Having said that, I own like seven Nano S and they hold a seven digit sum. So fingers crossed : - /

_(first let me say again I don't think this is going to be the scenario but...)_
Difficulty _would_ "simply adjust" in... three months. So you'd have three months of mining with blocks taking an average one hour to be found. Do I need to explain how this would fill the transaction backlog, make fees skyrocket and give the impression to many that BTC is "not working correctly anymore" which _may_ crash the price. While at the same time you'd have another chain with both bigger blocks and no mining issue and tiny fees.
Now _should_ the price crash, even more miners would leave. Turning the three months into six months etc.
Why do you think core devs already talked about emergency hardfork with a difficulty adjustent / PoW switch?  They simply don't want this scenario to kill BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:26:14
It's not Photoshop'ed... I installed the latest Ledger Chrome app a few days ago and when you check _"Show advanced options"_ as in the screenshot above, you get the four choices.
Also when you select, say, Bitcoin, you can then choose between "legacy" or "split", due to the Bitcoin cash fork.
Which I'm sure is going to get amazing soon: you'll have "legacy / legacy", "legacy / 2x", "split / legacy" (?) and "split / 2x" etc.

I'll answer in reverse, with the scariest last:

@_date: 2017-11-07 12:40:58


"nothing" is a strong word.  If 83% of the miners do _really_ leave the BTC chain, you'd realize that miners means something.  That'd mean huge tx backlog, gigantic fees, overall chaos, etc.  The current BTC chain simply wouldn't work correctly with blocks taking one hour on average and I'm really not sure the price would keep going up (or even stay stable) during the weeks/months needed before the next difficulty readjust.
To which you may answer: _"But 83% of the miners aren't going to leave"_ (I don't disagree with that).  But then that'd be conceding miners do mean something after all.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:23:50
It's not the same scenario at all: in the current, agreed on (well, mostly), sceneario you follow the current protocol and do no hard fork and continue to use what everyone considers to be "Bitcoin" (which happens to follow, among others, the original inflation curve from Satoshi's white paper).
While in your scenario people not only do an hard fork but they do it to change _the_ sacro-saint inflation curve. Not gonna happen.
I"m pretty sure game theory, which is _"the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers"_  (not my definition) can explain why intelligent rational decision makers aren't going to hardfork to modify the Bitcoin supply (no matter if it's up or down).
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:55:54
Can you explain how you came to that number? (it s obviously a scary number you picked: implying a 51% attack would be possible). Are they mining empty blocks? Not mining at all? (in which case a difficulty readjustement would fix the problem no!?).
I don't see miners mining temporarily a more profitable chain being "not bitcoin friendly" : they're just rational on the very short term.

I'm more of a BTC HODLer than an ETH one but still have quite some in ETH.
What I wonder is: is it good that the supply of ETH is reduced or bad that it's near impossible to get trivial smart contracts right and that hence it'll lead, again, to "bail out by Vitalik" (with the community circle-jerking at how great they are to accept yet another bail-out).

Yup exactly. It varies a lot, from as much as 50% (in countries where they can consider your crypto trading activities are a full time job and tax it as regular revenues: and some countries do tax revenue very, very high) to 0% (no just in the countries you mentioned).
You can also fully legally open a company in a country where capital losses aren't deductible and where capital gain taxes (made using corporate trading accounts) are taxed at 0%. You can have your own company pay yourself a salary or dividend or whatever and pay what you need to pay on these.

Not a bad move but... Austria is in the EU.
An EU court of justice ruled cryptos to be currencies, exempt from VAT when buying/selling. Capital gain taxes on cryptos that apply are basically the same as FOREX gain in many EU countries.

They did a lot for cryptocurrencies and back in the old days the trollbox was a great place. Mods could usually help with small issues (like failed withdrawals) without requiring you to issue tickets (that'd take weeks or months to resolve).
It was also at one point, I think, the biggest alt exchange.
Then all started going downhill.
I don't understand how in 4 years all they added to the website is a checkbox saying basically _"Update order book only every x seconds"_ (which was basically done to ease the load on their server: a downclocked Raspberry Pi apparently _and_ which should have been a server-side fix anyway).
So, yup, in 4 years I think the only change in the UI I saw is that checkbox added and a one-pixel wide green line for the buy order book and one-pixel red line for the sell order book.
One checkbox and two one-pixels wide lines. In four years. So logically they got r-ped pretty badly by Bittrex and Binance.
They got pwned so badly that they add to sell at a discount in the face of their endlessly falling market share, with a guarantee that US authorities wouldn't come after their cheaters' arses.
Because they also cheated pretty badly with pump &amp; dumps before delisting coins (just an example).
The recent wallet issue?  I hope that after being Gox'ed and Cryptsy'ed I'm not gonna get "Polonie'd" for the few BTCs worth of alts I've got there (but it's tiny compared to my overall stack: _"coins you don't have the private keys for aren't yours"_ etc.).
But honestly I think it's more Poloniex delay, lack of communication (sickening) and overall incompetence than a hack.

With the munnies I made selling at 14 000, I'll rebuy shitloads of BTCs (and crypto overall) if if goes really low.

I've got the exact same issue... I've got a _lot_ in BTC (and alts now). And sometimes I wish I could just go in full bear mode, sell it all for fiat (or gold, whatever) then come back in to buy more crypto.
(well I have to pay 0% tax on "capital" gains made trading FOREX so not exactly the same use case)
However there's no way I'm putting all my eggs in one basket, no matter how "legit" Coinbase/GDAX do look.
There's the counterparty risk (Coinbase/GDAX getting raided by the govt, Coinbase/GDAX getting hacked [I know, I know: they've got insurance], people at Coinbase/GDAX going rogue) and there's the risk my account gets hacked.
Even if they were a bank, they couldn't be trusted either.
Banks and insurance companies are precisely the kind of institutions crypto-currencies are fighting.
You cannot fully trust Coinbase/GDAX.  You cannot trust the banks where they keep their funds (what happens, to EU citizens, when the bank where Coinbase/GDAX keeps its EUR goes bankrupt and does a "bail-in", taking a haircut on every account that has more than 100 K EUR on it?).
So I "trust" them with something like 10% of my funds. Meaning I've got no easy way to get in/out of my entire position.
Also I do not trust them at all regarding the way they could abuse KYC/AML to freeze your funds: _"Where do you have all these BTCs from?"_ (geez, retard: I bought BTC in 2013 FFS!) or _"All these withdrawals look like 'structuring'"_ (geez, then change your withdrawals rules: if you write "max 10 K weekly", it's not to then come say _"You withdrew 10 K weekly for 20 weeks, that looks like structuring, we're freezing your account"_).
That's a major problem IMHO: no easy way to go in/out of entire position.
Maybe in the future we'll have real, working, crypto assets/tokens pegged to USD/EUR/Au/whatever and fully working provably trustable DEX allowing to go in/out of entire position without taking any counterparty risk.
But we're obviously not there yet.

Glad that you sorted it out.
The same SNAFU happened to my mother-in-law because she had her family name identical to someone who committed some fraud. Worse thing is: there are crazy "rules" in place here in Europe where bank employees can't tell you what's going, can't tell you why your account is locked etc.
This took months to sort out.
As a line of defense against this I've got accounts in _many_ banks (other reason is deposit warranty is per bank, not per person and I'd rather have a higher risk of one bank going bankrupt than the one where I keep all my fiat go kaboom): at least in case there's a mistake at one bank it shouldn't replicate to the other banks. Banks over several countries may help too: but that's easier to do in Europe than in the US.
 
Bitcoin has other issues (someone steals your seed/private keys and it's game over) but, yup, this solves the question of incompetent banks pretty nicely.

In countries where there's a big public sector and lots of government debt, yes definitely. Increasing the minimum wage of public sector workers is a sure tell that the government is going to print more money.
And it's actually worse than that...
Several economists are actually considering that big raise to the minimum wage of public sector workers is the first tell that hyper-inflation (not just inflation) is coming.
Venezuela is a "great" example of this.
People in this thread are partially wrong to think that it means "less job": public sector jobs are hardly ever shrinking. And this alone creates inflation when minimum wages are raised.

Sure. My country has 0% tax on cryptocurrency gains (and 0% on FOREX gains). 
Now even if it's not your case, depending on where you're from and how rich you are, there may be legal options. If you are, say, in the US and haven't cashed yet you could buy a passport from another country (requires to be rich already), renounce your US citizenship, pay your "exit tax" to your country, then cash out once you're not a US citizen anymore. It's only worth it if you really have a lot in BTC, like thousands of BTCs.
Note that several people have done just that and dodged US tax on insane crypto stashes (like Bitcoin jesus if I'm not mistaken).
There are also illegal options but, well, they're illegal.

_(first note that there are rumors of copy/paste malware changing BTC addresses during copy/paste)_
If it's a big amount and if it's two wallets of mine, I do always _"warm"_ the wallet first: I first test with a tiny transfer.
I do it from hardware wallet to hardware wallet: I note down the BTC address (say first 6 chars, last 6 chars) displaying on my hardware wallet's screen when I first do the small tx... Once I see the coins listed on my other hardware wallet, then I'm pretty sure I've got the address right and I do the big transfer: this time by verifying that the destination address I need to confirm on the first hardware wallet matches what I've written down.
This is failsafe even against malware changing addresses on screen (during copy/paste or whatever).

And the exit tax if you want to move after staying there more than 10 years out of the last 15 years (something to take into account too).
Correct move would hence be to sell first while being fiscal resident of an EU country with 0% tax on crypto winnings (there are several) but I digress.
Other great move would be to buy real-estate in Spain, rent them, and not actually live there more than six months per year (and also never more than 60 days in a row): that way you don't become fiscal resident and don't have to pay the yearly tax on wealth and yet get to get the returns.
What you're talking about is called "geographical arbitrage" if I'm not mistaken btw.
You made a great post and you're right: my point is just that I actually was there and while 1 million sounds like a lot, you still need to count and be careful... That's how I know about all this.  I own two piece of real estate, one of which gives me a nice little monthly rent (about 900 EUR / month for something I paid 90 K EUR and which is now worth close to 200 K: not a return as good as the ones you talk about spain for the montly rent, but not bad, especially considering that it did appreciate a lot).
It's just now that I kinda made bank on crypto and that I'm comfortably above that that I'm beginning to get more in a _"I can spend quite some without risking to get broke"_ mindset.
Now... Funny you mention Spain I just got my "NIE" (the number for foreigners in spain, doesn't mean I'm fiscal resident there) because the plan you talk about is basically my next plan: geographical arbitrage, sun, buying real estate in spain (you must have a NIE to do this: basically two visits at the police station), etc.
In Valencia for 275 K I think you can even have more than two rooms. Heck I think you can find stuff in Campolivar (Valencia / Paterna, posh neighborhood just outside of the city) for close that price: for 500 K you can buy a real baller villa.
We're on the same page and we see things the same way. I just meant to say that 1m USD is not "post wealth": you still need to be careful and if you're not, it'll go down fast (for example if you have to pay the yearly tax on wealth in France or Spain). Also there's the risk of tenants not paying their monthly rent etc.
So basically "you still need to count".
BTW: the "financial independence" (FI and FIRE) sub-reddits seem full of interesting infos but very US-centric, if you know about any sub-reddits where we can discuss stuff like that but more from an "investing and living in europe" standpoint, I'm all ears...

Thought a bit more about it: what would make sense for a rogue packer would be to buy himself five Nano S, then print sheets looking like an official Ledger doc (with the Ledger logo etc.), everytime with a different seed he knows, put one in each box, and re-seal the box with cellophane.
Then he'd go to work, keeping on him the 5 "compromised" Nano S boxes. When he has to pack a real one, he replaces it with one of his compromised one. Rinse &amp; repeat everyday: everyday he takes back brand new ones at home.
That's scary: it's something to be aware of.  It's a very real attack vector.
Makes me sad that some low-life motherfuckers may be reading this and now try to scam people.

Trading on Coinbase/GDAX shall be frozen "approximately 4 hours before the fork" and reopen "approximately 4 hours after the fork"...
Leaving very big players plenty of time to manipulate the markets.
Also Coinbase/GDAX is known for having their server (apparently powered by a Raspberry Pi) badly fail when there are many users online and big price movements.  Their API, for those who use that, seems to have a slightly better uptime than their website during these times: but nothing great.

They could be used in 2011 for sure (because that's when I discovered it), maybe before, in exchange for "player to player" tx on poker sites. Say you had 100 BTC and wanted 100 USD on PokerStars, and someone else had 100 USD or more on PokerStars and was willing to accept BTC, then there was a deal.
Deals were made on big poker forums.
It's not the first one, but it's among the first ones: basically using the poker sites' infrastructure to bring in real money and to allow player to player tx of real money, to buy BTC.
Quite creative.

I'd rather keep a low profile but... In the EU by an EU court of justice cryptocurrencies have been ruled to be, well, currencies (for example they're not considered to be a commodity nor stocks, etc.). It's then the country's national (or regional) fiscality considering FOREX gains which applies. And several EU countries have 0% tax on FOREX gains. Malta is such an example if I'm not mistaken (not necessarily saying I'm fiscal resident of Malta : )

"Coins on exchanges aren't yours".  If you want to risk being goxx'ed (that is: having the exchange steal your coins or have a thief stole your coins while at the exchange), you repeat a few cash outs, instead of going "all in" with 250 / 300 K.
You could sell your coins on Coinbase (or Gemine I guess if you're in the US), then withdraw to your bank account.
Then pay your taxes to uncle sam.

I'm not a US fiscal resident nor citizen: the country I live in has no gain tax on FOREX gains and cryptos are considered currencies so...

You get visual confirmation of transactions on the Trezor itself. Compromised PC could still try to trick you into sending your BTCs to a wrong BTC address but that's it (so triple-check before sending, or send first a small amount before sending a big amount, etc.). 
The whole point of hardware wallets, like the Trezor and the Ledger Nano S, is that the private key (really the master seed, which allows to generate a huge number of private keys) never leaves the hardware wallet. You can plug an hardware wallet into a fully compromised PC: your coins are still safe.
The whole mindset is: "I don't trust PC not to be full of 0-days, NSA backdoors, Intel backdoors, GAFAM backdoors, script kiddie exploits so I want a device that I can plug in a fully compromised machine and still be safe".
Now Trezor at one point did fuxx0r up badly: I don't know how they manage to do it but under some circumstances they'd like the private key.  They fixed the issue now. Ledger said their Nano S cannot have that same issue because they've "done it right" on the first try, unlike Trezor.
I still trust both the Trezor and the Nano S.

1 million USD sounds like a lot to most people but sadly it really isn't that much.  1 million in crypto is great to try to make it really big (I'm in that position) but it's not a "post wealth" life.
Depending on where you live it's about one house, one Lambo (if that's your thing) and then no revenue source from your wealth left because you just spent it all.
Moreover if OP is from the US or another country that taxes crypto winnings like crazy, that's, what, only 700 K left?
In the financial independence reddits you can see some retire at 1m USD but those who do have to adopt a frugal lifestyle: typically most are going to work a few more years and put a bit more aside. Those in the "retire early" mindset are targetting more like 5m to 10m.
I'm at about 1m in crypto (not quite) and 1.5 m not in crypto: that's enough "fuck you money" to never have a boss again but I still have to be careful in my day to day life. Some would say I'm crazy to have that much in crypto but it's all from money I could afford to lose. I don't want to re-balance yet.
1m USD in crypto at this point in time is a nice amount to try to become rich but it's not enough to be "rich".

An easier way is to add a few coins _from someone who already did split_ on chain A to your wallet. Then withdraw all coins on chain A to a new wallet you control on chain A. Because on chain B your wallet doesn't have that amount of coins, it cannot replay the tx. When you see your coins in your wallet on chain A, you move all the coins on chain B to a new wallet you control on chain B.
That's what I did to cleanly split my ETH/ETC back when ETH forked and my tx kept getting replayed: I created a tx that couldn't be replayed because of insufficient funds on one chain.

Can't you buy "real" BTC wherever you want (and download them to a wallet you control), then sell futures on OKEX (or somewhere else) and _also_ sell future B2x at the same time?
Say you buy a real BTC @ 5750 USD, which costs you 5750 USD for one real BTC + one B2X. And at the same time you sell a BTC future on OKEX @ 5250 USD and you sell a B2X future at HitBTC (or wherever) @ 1000 USD.
You're printing 500 USD per BTC you do that with (but you live with the counterparty risk: I take it you need collaterals on the exchange(s) on which you sell the futures).
Don't how if it actually works nor if some doing/trying that may be what's explaining the price diff.

This requires several things: to be good at trading, which most are not. It also requires having most of your BTCs on an exchange, ready to do such moves. Many keep their BTCs safely stored on paper wallets or hardware wallets.
But you're right: BTC has made x20 since I first bought it (around 2013/2014) and yet I've constantly outperformed it by trading it (and keeping the profits in BTC).
Basically it's a full time job to be a trader.

The "blockchain" doesn't know if a Bitcoin address has a corresponding private key or not.  All that is known is if the checksum of the Bitcoin address is ok or not.  If it's ok, you can send BTC to that address.  If on the contrary the checksum not ok, you cannot send BTC to that address.
It's when you want to _spend_ these BTC that you have to use the private key corresponding to the address.

I did a withdrawal of 100 EUR at a Santander ATM in Spain... 1.85 EUR of fees because the card I was using was from Caixa and not Santander.  I had no idea it worked that way, it is pure theft.  I needed the money immediately (so no time to find a Caixa atm: also I didn't know why I was being charged so much) and don't give a crap about such amounts but it's just insane.

As long as you don't believe that a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S is backdoored, then you don't need to d/l any blockchain to transact in BTC / ETH / ZEC / XMR / KMD / whatever.  Because _any_ transaction has to be confirmed on the Nano S itself, where you see the full destination address and amount you're sending. Coins cannot leave unless you confirm on the device itself.
So there are two possibilities: either you believe a Nano S is safe and hence you can _safely_ do transaction from your desktop/laptop/smartphone *without needing to download full blockchains*, or you believe the Nano S has a backdoor.
And should the Ledger server your hardware wallet is connecting to stop working, you're still free at anytime to download the full blockchain and enter your wallet's seed in a compatible software wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:47:57


Nope. That's only if you decide to "initialize a new device". I never ever use this function because I initialize my Nano S with a seeds I created by throwing dices (I'm not shitting you).
If the paper looks like a Ledger paper and says: "Click on 'restore configuration' and then enter the words on this piece of paper", I can assure you a lot of people would be fooled.
That's the whole idea: tricking people by presenting them 24 words already written down, in a paper looking like an official Ledger (or Trezor) paper.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:11:37
Yes... Because then in the case your tx gets replayed you end up at the beginning, which is not bad.
What is bad is, precisely, not sending to yourself: because then if it's replayed you end up sending coins on both chain to "not yourself" and you have to trust that "not yourself" to then send you half your coins back.

Another easy way: say you have 1 BTC on wallet X pre-fork.
Withdraw 0.01 BTC or something from someone who already did split/secure his coins on chain 1.
Move 1.01 BTC to wallet Y (wallet that you'll only use on chain 1). That transaction is not valid on chain 2, so cannot be replayed.
Move 1 "BTC" on chain 2 to wallet Z (wallet Z that you'll only use on chain 2).

Ledger Nano S in itself is unusable. You need to install "nano apps" on it. Not only can the hardware detect non-signed "nano-apps", but as far as I know it works both ways: nano apps, before installation (from your PC), are going to warn you if you try to run them on counterfeit hardware. I think the whole point is they contain some hardware security module and that module can't really be hacked/reproduced. Especially not with such a small form factor.
Now of course even without tampering directly with the Nano S I could imagine quite some mischief that a packer (not OP) could do. For example by "adding" some extra information / procedure to follow. Like, say, adding a piece of paper with 24 words saying: "This is your super secret seed of 24 words, follow this procedure to enter them into your Nano S...", which sadly would probably fool some people.

I think he's saying that because of the old beaten to death "5 USD wrench" attack when an attacker beats you to death until your reveal your PIN to steal your 0.1 BTC.  If the Nano ain't initialized, you could prove that to the attacker by plugging it in and saying "I don't know the seed, it's in a safe in my mom's name in switzerland", which is more plausible than not knowing the PIN of a device you have at your place/on you.
Ofc there's no need because the Nano S has a "plausible deniability" feature anyway, where you can have two wallets: the real one, with your fortune and a fake one, with 0.01 BTC, that you give if an attacker beats you to death.
