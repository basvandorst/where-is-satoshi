I'm not providing predictions, just stating price points at certain levels of adoption.

J.P. Morgan Chase level size would put BTC at $120,667.  Their assets under management would put it at  
It's already bigger than Deutsche, RBC, Credit Suisse, UBS, BNP Paribas, Santander, BBVA and more.

Price stability and predictability comes with scale, liquidity, and low barriers to entry. You can't start a global currency from $0 over only 10 years without some volatility on the way up.
Complaining that Bitcoin isn't stable enough or big enough is like bashing Macintoshes (the Lisa) for costing $10,000 in the 80's. The tech is still in its infancy.

Totally, better technologies have risen and fallen, we can never be certain of anything success whether it's promising or not.

The average person is not going to go through coinbase's KYC. They'd rather use their retirement accounts, for which the only current option is GBTC. GBTC doesn't affect the ecosystem since it's a trust. This is why it cost 40% to 60%  more than the Bitcoin it was worth, that's pent up demand. The premium is now down to a reasonable level, yet BTC remains above 6k.
Technology often takes a very long time to catch on. Email wasn't widely used until 20 years later. Bitcoin has time. Also many people have heard about it, but barely anyone has bought any, somewhere under 25 million or so. That's nothing Bitcoin is still tiny. That's why it's volatile, it's an emerging asset class and nobody knows how much it's gonna be worth.
As far as deflation, we've never seen a commodity or currency with a slow deflation rate, only currencies with runaway deflation. Runaway deflation is just as serious as runaway inflation. As Bitcoin becomes more widely adopted, the deflation rate will slow and should plateau at full adoption (wherever that lands). As the Bitcoin economy grows, whales also begin to have less power as they become a smaller and smaller percentage of trading volume.

Plenty of people trust and believe in Bitcoin, that is evidenced by the billions invested into it and the business ecosystem that has popped up around it. While volatility has been high over the past year, Bitcoin has still been up about 200% over the past year the entire time. While that gap is dropping, not too long ago Bitcoin was worth like $250. Bitcoin is a global currency that has operated 24/7/365 with 0 downtime and 100.00% accuracy, bringing it from literally $0, to cents, to dollars, to now thousands of dollars.
I said Bitcoin is small, and yes, it's so small that speculators have pushed it up and down wildly in effect because they see it as insurance against global monetary policy or maybe even as a lottery ticket. After all, it's incredibly cheap right now if this thing is ever gonna catch on. That being said, there is a lot of real belief in Bitcoin, and that is reflected in the fact that it has appreciated in value over 10,000% since Nouriel Roubini first laughed about it's fall in value from a "bubble" bursting in 2013.
