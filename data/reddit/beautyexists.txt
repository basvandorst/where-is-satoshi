DING DING DING we have a winner!
There isn't one for a true libertarian.

Strawman/false dilemma in the first sentence? Really?
You really can't answer your own stupid question? Especially in this type of subreddit.

Who says what we pay them for? You are happy about warring against other nations for the fact that you pay taxes?
@_date: 2013-07-22 14:54:00
My honest, extremely biased answer? Because I think a lot of ancaps see principles and ideas behind words, whereas other people get caught up on such abstractions as "government" or "the state" without knowing the idea behind them... and in some cases, blatantly ignoring facts that are right in front of them.
Sorry if that's not the answer you were looking for. Like I said, very biased.

I'm opposed to taxation, so even though I personally find it immoral, I wish people like yourself who don't find it immoral would think more like you do.

Oh, and for reference's sake, I didn't downvote you or anything of the sort.
Funny, though, that you *preceded* your "plea" to have an adult conversation by mocking me when I did nothing of the sort. 
Yes, I'm sure you really want an adult conversation. Grow up, asshole.

I guess this is why I was confused about your other post.
Ancaps hugely stress ethics. Property rights and, to a lesser extent and more unofficially, the NAP, is the basis of the philosophy. That itself is what ancaps believe necessitates the first part of your post. The free market itself is a CONSEQUENCE of that, not the other way around. Definitely, definitely, definitely not the other way around.

I was responding to your general idea with a general aside, not talking specifically about that guy.
Sorry, but this conversation is going nowhere. I frankly don't care enough about Reddit mechanics to discuss it, it seems pretty pointless.

You seem to not understand the reason Bitcoin was created. It is not exactly about trust, as you put it. It's about what should and should not be.

You keep ignoring critical points and cherry picking one or two points to go into some tangent. Why don't you respond to his following out your legislative reasoning even further than where it is now? 
That's a pretty critical point in your logic that you're failing to address.

Comparing, on equal terms, the organization of a group of people to a separate group of people that can "legally" force people to do things against their will, when they haven't done shit to anyone? Yeah ad hominem I know, but you are fucking RIDICULOUS if you really think that.
And your "argument" of the Wikipedia article [makes zero sense](


Like I implied, you don't seem to understand the difference between organizing peaceably and organizing forcefully. 


Again, is there some magical wonder that the imposition of force creates? You're kidding yourself. You are implying in logical terms that we wouldn't be where we're at without the threat of force. So are you saying that it's in most humans' nature to be a completely helpless organism, incapable of advancing technology (contrary to a simple view of history, of course) without someone to light a fire under his ass? Like I said, history, of course, proves this wrong, but whatever I guess..?

I had written a response to all that until I got to this. Sorry if I won't give the time of day to someone who just told me that, if need be, he will kill to take what's not his. Your little arbitrary situation doesn't change the fact that you're perfectly fine with aggression. No need to beat around the bush here.
Have a nice day.
@_date: 2013-07-22 14:25:27


Implying what, exactly? The quote about liberty implies over anything else that he sympathizes with libertarian views.
I wouldn't expect to see conservative Republican remarking how the software he created would greatly benefit liberal Democrats, but you're saying you would expect something like that?
@_date: 2013-05-11 18:38:14
Oh, right, when you replied to ME saying "you guys", he wasn't addressing me because he didn't specifically name me.
Right. Silly me to think that.
PS: The posts I usually see downvoted to oblivion contain some of the worst logic I've ever seen and, not that I advocate group downvoting, they seem to be justifiably downvoted. And a lot of the responses from the downvoted user are generally nasty, defensive, or flat out dick-ish. But then I don't visit the subreddit very often so I can't know for sure.

You're twisting words. That would be a fascist system. The ancap "system", if you want to abstract the idea by calling it that, allows people the freedom to set up such a system. So long as the people in it truly submit to it and don't impose themselves aggressively on others that don't want such a system imposed on them.
It is rare to meet an ancap or read ancap literature that opposes or doesn't recognize the NAP.


The thing about anarcho-capitalism is, it doesn't have to. Not that the fact has stopped many prominent ancaps from coming up with alternate ideas or enhancements to the stagnated system.
Maybe I'm not sure what you're trying to say.

Because the problem is inherent to the state and has been for hundreds/thousands of years.
