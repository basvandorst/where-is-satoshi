Heifer International provides long-term solutions to give people a hand up so they can pull themselves (and ultimately, their whole community) out of poverty. Heifer’s programs start with education, feature a common sense approach at a local level, and have a proven track record of sustainability!
I discovered them through Patrick Rothfuss' WorldBuilders fund, constantly hear great things about their work.
