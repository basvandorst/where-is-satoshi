Hello guys, yesterday I sent some ETC from my Polo account to my MEW ETC address which is the first time I use it, and when I check the balance of the address on gastracker.io it shows the balance as if I had received the ETC and it shows the transaction as type IN, it has 4000+ confirmations already but when I check the balance on MEW it shows ZERO BALANCE and zero transactions. If I try to send funds from it it says I cant because there are no funds.
Is it possible that my transaction anyhow got lost ? Ive checked the address a million times and it is correct.
Do I need Eth funds in order to receive Etc???
Please help.

So it happens a lot to me when trading on bitmex that de stop limit is triggered yet the order does not fill, I leave about 10 dollars spread between the triggering price and the limit price. Is it because of a gap or am I missing something ???
Thank you for taking your time and helping.

It seems to me that we're heading back to 8k.
