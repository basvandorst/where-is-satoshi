Why did you store USD on an exchange that wasnt regulated in the US? I dont want to sound like a smart ass and I know most people in the space go "derp a derp free market principals", but seriously some regulations are made for this exact reason!

Pretty sure he's from South Korea and owns an exchange there (competitor), and this innocent post along with previous ones are his attempt at a FUD campaign. Hell we havent even opened yet lol.

Multiple errors, blatant wrong assumptions made, and omission of significant information. This reads more like an advertizement then an "article". 
All in all a poorly written article.

The very existence of complex trading you and other exchanges offer is not only detrimental to the crypto currency movement, but also are unethical. Instead of offering a wholesome product, you and others have managed to transform it into the same complications that we have today within banking and finance. You should be ashamed of yourselves letting greed take over and setting back a natural evolution of crypto currencies with passive manipulation of the price via leveraging, derivatives, and other complex trading.
I don't expect you to change your business based on a single post, however you need to put some serious thought into your business model and try to put safeguards in place in order to remove such significant risk to everyone. You are not helping spread awareness or adoption, only lining your own pockets with dirty money.
I read a comment one time, and I believe that this type of situation warrants repeating. "It's like we moved the assholes (wall street traders) from one place to another".
I am asking from an upstanding crypto community member, please take this seriously. At this point we as a community (everyone in crypto's) can not afford to have exchanges continue to do these types of trading without safeguards in place.

What does that mean? Are you saying that with 50% more the money you are asking for, you are going to put the entire reason you are getting that money at the bottom of the list?

I can assure you that the last 10k you are receiving is more or less coming from the Litecoin community. We have been pushing hard for it on both and Litecointalk.
There are a bunch of people interested in Litecoin. And it would be a huge let down if you decided to put LTC the back burner.
@_date: 2014-11-23 00:39:03
Two things, first of all when I was running my pool back earlier this year I had similar experiences. We had an auto switching pool that paid out in LTC, and used Crypsty. Quite a number of times there was "issues" and it made us very difficult for us to operate when every other week we had to state that there were yet again issues with the exchange we were using. At one time crypsty sold a batch of coins 15 times over in a bug on their end, and once they patched things up made us pay for it out of our own pool account! The pool is no longer operating partially because of the crypsty issues we had.
Second thing, please reach out to me on Litecointalk if possible. I am going to be introducing an exchange called Koinyx, and would love to talk to you about a few things. :)
Here is the direct link, please send me a PM (or if you have an email address let me know).

This is a common misconception with wallets in general. Technically the coins you have do NOT reside on whatever medium you chose to store them on. All coins reside on the blockchain itself. Wallets are merely the interface to access the blockchain and your specific address/coins. 
The same thing goes for cold storage. You are not putting your coins in cold storage, just the private key itself. If Joe smith over in India right now created a cold/paper wallet with 100 BTC and I had the private keys, I can get a hold of his coins.

@_date: 2015-07-25 19:29:25
I fully understand, and as I have stated before I have nothing personally against Blockstream. They are a company who has investors and should make money.
The problem is the conflict of interest and how exactly the monetize the companies work for the benefit of their investors.
There is an issue in regards to the max block limit. There also is two parties that are involved with trying to determine how to fix the impending issue. On one side is a proposition to tweak a parameter in order to alleviate the issue for now (I dont believe this is a full answer and something else needs to be done). On the other side, there is a group who is working for a company that proposes a solution to a foundational problem (who is also funded by VC's that expect to get paid).
My issue, as has always been, is a private company (even with the best of intentions) is planning on fixing a foundational and fundamental problem. There are just to many questions that need to be answered. 
I also understand that this is not a simple issue to fix either, because whatever is done will ripple throughout the network to all users, businesses, miners, etc.

Additional thoughts of mine.
Ian DeMartino: Do you have an opinion on the block size debate?
Andrew Vegetabile: I have been forming an opinion yes, but it’s still forming due to what little time I have dedicated to researching the topic. I am leaning towards increasing the block size as opposed to the sidechains suggestion for a few reasons so far (however I also recognize that might not be a final solution either). On a philosophical level, the purpose of the Bitcoin’s (or any coin’s) developers is to produce a foundation in order for others to build on for third party applications (perfect example, smart contracts). Having a company propose a solution to a fundamental problem and implement it scares me. What would happen if they fold up? Who would then be responsible to fix the problem? Will the code be open source for others to help pick it up? And for that matter, will the code be open source at all so we can have multiple eyes on it to ensure that 4 billion+ dollars are safe?
In addition, and this is by no means a knock to Blockstream at all, they have received $20 million in order to work on this (which companies do, they need funding). What I do not know is that how they will monetize this system to pay back their investors.
Lastly, from what little time I had to look into sidechains, I believe that it’s going to end up being more of a novelty than a solution to today’s woes. The step in the right direction so far, from what I have gathered, is an incremental increase in the block size.
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:09:26
Thanks for proving my point. Now the question that I, as well as others, need to have answered is how Blockstream plans to incentivize their work.
Getting an answer to that will show what their true intentions are.

@_date: 2015-07-25 15:39:37
I'm sorry but im not personally buying it. There is no way that they need such a substantial amount of money from "investors" (venture capitalists) in order to fund this project as a non profit, which is what you are suggesting.
*Additional investment firms that contributed to the round included Crypto Currency Partners, Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors, Future\Perfect Ventures, Mosaic Ventures, Ribbit Capital and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang’s AME Cloud Ventures.*
Sure are a lot of philanthropic VC's on that list.........
In addition, if this really was a project in which people are doing it for the love of there work as opposed to having a financial incentive, it would have made much more sense to open it as a non-profit as opposed to whatever they are registered as (I assume an LLC).
It all smells fishy, and unless they change to a 501c or something similar I will not trust the intentions of Blockstream.
@_date: 2015-08-16 04:41:39
Ironic that a thread about censorship is allowed, especially since the topic of what is being censored is allowed in the body of the thread. 
At any case, discussion about XT is paramount to the evolution of crypto currencies.

You obviously have nothing better to do if you not once, not twice, but now three times in a single thread slam LTC for no reason than for your own delusional thoughts.
Nice way of basically chickening out of putting your cards on the table and not being able to back up your assertions other then some nonsense post you created nearly 2 years ago, which might I add is very old and outdated.
@_date: 2015-07-27 07:18:06
OP has not posted once since posting this (unless its under a hidden comment I missed).
So either they really are intimidated by the amount of male chauvinists in this thread, or they are looking for attention.
Im betting it the former......Shame on you guys.
@_date: 2015-07-25 18:40:28
You dont need to explain how Bitcoin XT is an alt and hard forks of the main chain. I literally wrote the paper on it ;)
*Nearly every alternative coin (altcoin, or simply “alt”) in existence is a code fork, a fork of Bitcoin, either directly such as Litecoin and Namecoin or indirectly such as Dogecoin forking from Luckycoin (itself a Litecoin fork). This is well known to those within the industry, but it isn’t really talked about and is rarely considered. Parameter, algorithm, and name changes are made,and the industry accepts the new fork as something brand new. However, technically speaking, what the crypto ecosystem really has is another rendition of Bitcoin. In terms of name changes they could easily be labeled Bitcoin – Litecoin, or Bitcoin – Dogecoin, an updated version to the Bitcoin Core client. Counter to that, once a forked coin (altcoin) grows a community and internal ecosystem, they could be considered separate. But the inception of said coin still has its roots firmly planted in the technology that Bitcoin gave to the world.*
@_date: 2015-07-24 01:16:35
For you being a "leader" in crypto currencies (only by nature of the fact that you are a core developer), your attitude speaks poorly of the community you represent. Not just with this, but on a few topics/occasions.
Regardless, I'm very well aware of your anti-LTC stance. So aware of it that im more than happy to have a one on one discussions of your stance and why you are wrong. Feel free to pick a podcast or radio show of your choosing, im sure whichever one you pick we can arrange to host.
So you up for it since you are so certain that LTC is a scam? Put your cards on the table if you are going to continue this facade.
