Do you know if they are still going to give you the bitcoin since you are not 18 yet?

Mt Gox says that a bank statement is not valid.

I assumed they were safe considering that they were the largest and oldest exchange. I should have just kept my money with coinbase.

A very expensive learning experience.

3k USD.  I don't know what I would have done if I had lost $1.5M

I didn't want to trade bitcoin daily. I just wanted to be able to sell my BTC incase any bad news came out, and to protect my self from a drastic drop in price.. The firs time i purchased from coinbase, I bought 1 btc for 980 , and i was unable to sell it when it was around 1.1k. A few days later,when the BTC was finally in my account the value of that BTC dropped to about $800.

Dude Congrats. Try to not spend your money on unnecessary and useless stuff. 9k is a lot for someone our age,and you might be tempted to "ball out".

Fuck off
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:29:21
Yeah it's a bunch of bullshit. I knew that they required verification to withdraw USD, but did not know that they also required it to withdraw BTC,other wise I would have never deposited those BTC with them

About 3k total.  I deposited my coins there a couple of months ago and I have been trying to withdraw them ever since. My account was not verified because I was under 18, so I was unable to withdraw them whatsoever. This is a lot of money for me since I will be going to college next year, so it looks like I'm going to apply to every single fucking scholarship out there to try and gain back my money. I seriously think it's unfair that mtgox let people deposit bitcoins without being verified, but not withdraw them .

I applied for a bitstamp account, but i was underage. I just turned 18 yesterday.

Dude, that's a lot for me. Im still a H.S student, and will be going to college in a couple of months.
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:14:16
I don't have a cellphone bill or anything else.
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:15:06
I will just stick to coinbase.

Yep. He has only been a member for 14min
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:46:36
Thanks I pmd the guy, hopefully he got everything sorted out . I turn 18 in February , so it's really no big deal asking as bitcoin doesn't keep dropping in value .

I registered about 3-4 weeks ago and I used my own personal info .
