I wouldn't have so many Bitcoins at this point if I spent them.

The problem with coins like dogecoin is everyone knows Ebay, Amazon, etc. would accept Bitcoin before them.

Yeah but it's the main headline now
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:21:35
Thanks, that was the first time I laughed today
@_date: 2014-12-11 03:41:33
This is a very good reason for the Bitcoin price to drop, as it normally does with such news
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:00:00
I meant it's the main headline for the first time... sorry mistype in title
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:24:25
Maybe Mark Karpeles was bribed to make Bitcoin crash!
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:06:22
Good question. I've been too obsessed with Bitcoin for too long now, so I'm not sure if I can think about it objectively.
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:15:19
Talk about the exploitation of children, of course. /s
@_date: 2014-12-14 05:04:51
Because Bitcoins are like gold. Any argument about Bitcoin's price can also be applied to the price of gold.
@_date: 2014-12-14 05:25:49


It was obvious to me, that's why I invested a lot in bitcoins in 2011. Everyone I knew thought I was crazy.
@_date: 2014-05-30 14:47:31
This has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:41:26
So does the internet.

Gavin has been developing Bitcoin for years and is (or was?) the lead developer. The buttcoin people have been trolling the bitcoiners since 2011 or so. Gavin is probably annoyed by them. I'm not sure if there are any recent events in the last few days that this is in reference to.

I was wondering the same thing when I bought a whole bunch of Bitcoins between $100-$520 from Coinbase. Guess not!

There is exponential growth in users beneath a speculative price bubble.
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:29:48
Poor people don't buy bitcoin, or sell it too early, because they are too risk-averse. Only upper middle class and upper class buy lots of Bitcoin to begin with.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:05:08
It's possible, but probably very difficult. You would need to hire people to investigate whether each claim for lost bitcoins is real or fradulent.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:09:30
The transaction fee for this happened to be 0.
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:53:30
I'd like reddit to pay me 50 BTC also, can anyone send me it? 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:06:29
That doesn't mean he made the transfer, and also the cost was 0, not 37 cents.

I first heard about them in April 2011 when Bitcoin posts kept appearing in I remember thinking something like, "Wow, these Bitcoin people are so nerdy, I can't believe they think they'll accomplish anything." I thought it was like play money. But then I read into it more, concluded it was a great idea, and bought some.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:57:11
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:51:24
I don't think Bitcoin will stabilize unless it can reach gold parity. Which would be absolutely ridiculous (and amazing) if it happens.

@_date: 2013-11-20 14:58:27
just go to coinbase.com and buy bitcoins... it isn't rocket science
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:17:15
Bitcoin would probably crash really badly, as would most speculative things.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:23:06
Do you have a link?

GH/s is gigahashes per second, not gigahertz.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:21:25
Bitcoin usage is at a consistent all-time high, so I think it could level off at $3000 or so.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:29:08
That doesn't mean he was the one who made the transfer though. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:12:06
Ok, but that doesn't make it more of a bubble than anything else we find valuable.

Clinkle is an optimization of the status quo. Bitcoin is revolutionary.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:53:28
Well maybe the effect wouldn't be immediate
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:30:43
Yeah, my first reaction was to laugh and scoff at it. It took me about a month or two before I started to see the potential value and buy some.
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:57:15
You could make the same arguments about gold. Is it really worth 6 trillion dollars?
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:25:38
no idea

Bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous.

I doubt it. Probably takes a day.

I first bought Bitcoins when they were at $16 in 2011. They eventually crashed to $2. I felt really embarrassed by it all, since I had hyped it up to my family, and basically stopped thinking about them until one day I noticed they hit $250 or so in the news. Fortunately, I still had the Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:31:41
What if your Bitcoin investment appreciates to be the majority of your life savings? Do you advise selling all your Bitcoins?
