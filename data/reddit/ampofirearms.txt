You could be the first person in the world to buy a Barrett with BTC!  We were thinking about getting our SOT in July when the new tax year starts, however with eforms currently down, it is probably more headache than it is worth.  I believe we can drop ship suppressors if you are looking for a can.

I believe we only have the Liberty 9mm+p in lead free in stock plus some various rifle ammunition that is more geared towards hunters.

He was selling guns illegally.  Didn't matter what currency he was using.  We are federally licensed by the ATF and will not sell to a prohibited person.

If you click on our advanced search, and select the ammunition category, you can search for either 223 or 556 and it will bring up everything we have.  Sign up on our website to get updates from us.  You can also set back in stock notifications.  Our inventory is always changing and you need to be quick on the 556 ammo.

We use Coinbase as our BTC processor.  Unfortunately the firearms industry is very limited in credit card payment processors because of society's stigma against firearm ownership.  After you go through the headache of finding a processor that will accept a firearms dealer, you have to pay higher rates than a normal company.  Bitcoin solves all of these problems.  But you can still save 5% no matter what your payment method is.  We will be posting daily specials starting next week so be sure to check us out!
