There no reason anyone would have to send any coins to this address. So this is a non-issue.


The username whiskers75 is verifiable only through a signature from the the address 
The address generated from the password "whiskers75-bitcoin-username" with is only used to identify 1whiskrpGeZVd5ormX2ihifc9uB2YSz82 as the owner of the username whiskers75. The fact the password is public is of no concern because signatures from that password can not be used for authentication.

Have you ever considered where that 2% loss in the value goes to.
If you think it goes to funding schools and fixing roads I have some bad news for you.
It is (almost entirely) spawned into existence by banks who lend it out with between 3 and 50% annual interest.
If you buy a plot of land, building materials and pay workers to build you a house and the entire project costs you $400,000. To fund it with an average mortgage (30 years at 4% interest) you will end up paying the bank $287,000 in interest alone.
I dont know about you but I don't think that the value of the service provided by the bank is worth anywhere near the 30% of the cost making a house from scratch.

Bitcoin transactions (once in a block) cannot be rewritten.
nLockTime when added to a transaction specifies a time which that transaction cannot be confirmed (added to the blockchain) before.
GreenAddress signs a transaction sending all your bitcoins to an address you specify that cannot be confirmed until a certain time (for example after 1 year has passed) and gives it to you.
If GreenAddress disappears (if the coins are still there) you can transmit that transaction once the time has passed and regain control of the bitcoins.
You (or GreenAddress, or a thief) can at any time create a new transaction without a nLockTime and send the bitcoins elsewhere immediately. This would make the nLockTime transaction useless (because it would be a double-spend).

The circular logic in this logic is flawed.
What you are describing is known as a [deflationary spiral](
The theory is that everyone will save bitcoins because instead of spend them they would rather wait until they are worth more at which point they will then continue to save because instead they would rather wait until they are worth more...
This theory completely misses a crucial detail: people don't save for the sake of just having as much money as possible when they die, they save it to spend it later. If this wasn't true then high interest bank accounts would have ruined society by now.
In reality people invest or buy consumables when the value to them at that point outweighs the prospect of being able to possibly get more in the future.

4. 1NFq92ve9VHUqAARobLZPxsPNRMMv4RPGg -&gt; 15xJJKHzSvnfVoYttsnA3gVM4QUZD5rbSJ 
In both cases the transaction consists of 1 input: 1 BTC from 15xJJKHzSvnfVoYttsnA3gVM4QUZD5rbSJ and 1 output: 25 BTC to 15xJJKHzSvnfVoYttsnA3gVM4QUZD5rbSJ

This is a pretty unique threat you are talking about, if the malware is on the device with the wallet It'd be much more practical for it to directly steal the coins than to manipulate addresses.
I imagine you're talking about malware that has access to the network communications (for example from a compromised public hotspot) or webpage display (such as browser plugins or extensions).
Both of these issues are solved in the payment protocol by using X.509 certificates (the system that produces the green lock and a name for verification while on your bank's web page) to create an encrypted tunnel between your wallet software and the payment recipient.

To compare bitcoin with the internet we are only just beginning to see VC investment and still using raw bitcoin addresses. 
In 1994 The World Wide Web was introduced which (amongst other things) hid scary looking IP addresses underneath domain names. I believe this made the internet more intuitive for the general public and was pivotal in helping the internet become what it is today.
The payment protocol should be able to hide bitcoin addresses but its still being developed and is a ways widespread adoption.
Based on this I reckon the progress of bitcoin is comparable to the progress of the internet in 1993 or earlier.

What most people don't realise is when the government creates for money for themselves to pay for these things there is no value being created. The only reason that money it can be used for anything is because that value is being sucked out from all of the other dollars already in existence.

If the TXID is a hash of that stuff alone could someone purposefully create multiple transactions with identical TXIDs For example:
Alice Sends 1 BTC from 15xJJKHzSvnfVoYttsnA3gVM4QUZD5rbSJ to 1NFq92ve9VHUqAARobLZPxsPNRMMv4RPGg
Then sends 1 BTC back to 15xJJKHzSvnfVoYttsnA3gVM4QUZD5rbSJ and creates a new transaction that has the exact same inputs and outputs as before.
Wouldn't that second transaction have the same TXID as the first and wouldn't that potentially break stuff?

If someone had a hashed password list with passwords hashed in exactly the same as what bitcoin uses:
Then ASIC miners might be able to be adapted to do faster bruteforcing on it.

You don't have to take his word for it.
I have spoken to quite a few people about bitcoin and the one thing I've found that turns people off the most is the volatility and it's just too unintuitive.
I'm sure if you ask around you'll probably get the same response.
But if you asked someone "Is the internet a good media distribution platform" a mere 5 years after it's inception the response would have been a resounding no.

If we adopted [Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLTs)]( all blocks would be the same size regardless of the number of transactions included in them.
The limit on supply would still exist because a block is likely to be orphaned if it is too dissimilar to what other nodes are expecting.
So if a miner included thousands of spam transactions that block would probably be orphaned.

Bitcoin aims to move control of money away from financial institutions but its these exact organisations that are holding bitcoin back!
You can't just buy bitcoin like you can buy for example a song online because why would any financial institution allow it? They are competing with bitcoin and using their monopolistic control they are saying no.
The only other option is to use cash which simply doesn't work online.
Bitcoin is the solution to both of these problems.

A worrying number of people are misinterpreting these numbers.
For the majority of the time only a fraction of the bitcoins referenced in a transaction changes hands.
Say I received 100 BTC in one transaction and I buy something for 1 BTC the new transaction will show 100 BTC.
There is no way for anyone to know that 99 BTC went back to the me.
[Here's why](
Another thing inflating these numbers is the use of [mixing services]( they potentially generate hundreds of times the transaction volume of the BTC actually held.
TL;DR: Transaction volume ≠ bitcoins changing hands.

A web site to use in conjunction with cold storage!
Electrum and Armory both have very good offline wallet support but require running the full version of the software on a computer to use.
We could really use a website where you can input your watching only wallet (armory) or master public key (Electrum) and enjoy the convenience of an web wallet (for receiving bitcoins) but with the security of an offline wallet (for sending bitcoins).
I made a thread to discuss this some time ago idea here:

Money is hinged on the concept of saleability which is basically 2 things:
1. The ease in which the monetary objects can be subdivided and transacted.
2. The trust people have that that they will not decrease in value.
 
This concept has been historically researched at length by economists such as 
[Carl Menger](
When you compare bitcoin to existing systems looking at it from this perspective Bitcoin (and other crypto currencies) have some distinct advantages.
Cash (and commodities) are simply not (practically) transactable over the internet.
The only alternitive is to rely on third parties who [can]( [and]( [do]( [screw people over]( - Not a problem for Bitcoin
The value of goverment backed currencies [can have have been devalued]( for the benifit of special internests. - Also not a problem for Bitcoin.

I just watched the entire thing and I was surprised because there didn't seem to be a single person in the room who understood the technology behind bitcoin.
Something that I think was completely misunderstood is the fact that blockchain is not encrypted, this is extremely powerful from a regulatory standpoint because any bitcoins that goes through a known address essentially turns into a super marked bill with a gps tracker attached.
For example we know that 3,171 BTC was stolen from betcoin in April 2012 and on 15 March 2013 some of it made its way to Mt Gox. Authorities will be able to get the ID used to authenticate that Mt Gox account. Compared to the trail there would be if this was cash that is a substantial lead.

I disagree:
Every single bitcoin client and miner would have to agree to use and adopt the new PoS bitcoin client and anyone that failed to do so would continue to operate on their own fork of the blockchain. This could be disastrous. Therefore the bitcoin devs would never do it.
Also the people who have invested in mining hardware would never agree because it would essentially make their investment worthless.
If people wanted PoS then they'd exchange to a PoS coin.

You could encrypt the wallet using a counter based OTP(One Time Pass) supported by google authenticator and re-encrypt it with the counter incremented every time it was opened.
This has a couple of major flaws:
The OTP is a number from 0 to 999,999 so could be easily brute forced.
If someone had access to a copy of the encrypted wallet they could reuse the OTP.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:22:43
I'd like to run through a few common counter arguments and misconceptions:
 
 large proportion of Bitcoin opposers think because the early adopters made a lot of money it must be a pyramid scheme. 
Bitcoin, by design behaves in exactly the opposite manner to pyramid scheme, instead of following exponential growth (and inevitable crash), the supply of bitcoin is following a [reciprocal curve](
 people believe that because Bitcoins are not backed by anything they are not worth anything
US Dollars aren't backed by anything either. All currencies are valued only by their users in regards to their usefulness and availability. But unlike with any conventional currencies there is no risk of them being affected by a large increase in supply (like what happened to Ugandan Shilling).
 
 Many sceptics believe bitcoins are "Created out of thin air" and therefore can be devalued by a huge increase huge increase in supply by a creator.
 
The new Bitcoins are given to "miners" who essentially solve a mathematical problem equivalent to throwing 100 dice and the if 16 of them land on one (Approximately 1 in 5 quintillion chance) they are rewarded with a few Bitcoins. Thousands of people all over the world are trying this millions of times a second and the first one to do it is rewarded with a few new Bitcoins. The only way someone could manipulate the supply is by spending literally millions of dollars on equipment to reliably beat everyone else in the race.
 
 argument against Bitcoin is they are not safe because "X amount of Bitcoins have been lost from service Y".
There has never been any stolen money from a vulnerability in bitcoin network or the official wallet!
Bitcoins (like with all currency) are only as secure as where they are stored, If you entrust your Bitcoins to anyone else, just like with any other currency there is no [guarantee you will see that money again](
I also strongly recommend you have a look at [this page on bitcoin myths](

I just think that the fact it it is even possible to work for bitcoin at all is promising.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:09:23
Every update must be forward compatible or adopted by every Bitcoin client simultaneously otherwise a hard-fork is created which will inevitably create double spends.
If an update created a new non-forward compatible version of the blockchain than both versions could exist simultaneously in disagreement meaning Alice could send btc to Bob who in using version A then send the same bitcoins Charlie who is using version B and then Alice would have spent Twice as many bitcoins as she actually owns.
[This has happened before!](
Fortunately at that time bitcoin's user base was small enough, everyone updated and the successful double spend was not exploited. 
There is almost a 10x increase in bitcoin users now and there is even a variety of bitcoin clients. Making any future forks much harder and/or more damaging.
