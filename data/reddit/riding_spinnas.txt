I realize this is r/bitcoin and not r/lawyers, but nevertheless this raises an interesting ethical issue. Of course I don't know the specifics of your attorney/client contract, but typically a "retainer" is an up front amount that the attorney bills against. From an ethical standpoint, the client retainer is to be placed in the firms "client escrow or trust" account. When work is done and the client is billed, the attorney can remove the amount owed from the client trust account as a payment for their services. Technically the amount held in the client trust account is the property of the client until it is billed against. The ABA rules of professional conduct (which most if not all states have adopted almost verbatim) has very strict rules for client trust accounts. Additionally each state makes you register your client trust account. So unless the attorney is collecting a flat fee or non-refundable retainer, he's committing a pretty serious ethical violation by not keeping the client payment in the appropriate account. In top of that mismanagement of client funds is one of the easiest way to get your license suspended or disbarred.

Is this a retainer you're billing against or a flat fee/ non-refundable retainer? If the former, how are you able to get by the rules requiring retainer to be held in a client trust account?

What exactly does it mean to lock in during "this period?"

Would this apply to a credit/debit card purchase, or only a bank purchase. I though if it was through a card it was more or less instant.
