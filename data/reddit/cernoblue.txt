Use a paper wallet. The 'paper wallet dangerous' are just shills telling you to buy trezor or ledger or some other stupid usb stick that costs waay too much.
Been Bitcoining 100 bucks for over a year on a paper wallet and it's stil there...
Moved it a couple times , NOTHING happened.

This is what will really happen and has been happening you fomos.
up up up
original pumpers sell
fomos get in (up up up)
fomos get out
stronger fomos get in (you right now)
pumpers still slowly selling as not to shock the market and actually get their profit
Hence why the "don't Britcnoi!!1!!11" news.

It's whales. Nothing more. 3000 floating were only the hodlers keeping it there, if not for them it would've dropped to $50-200 easily.

Paper wallet is your friend.
Learn the basics and principles behind crypto, how to send, receive, braodcast, sign, verify etc all that jazz OFFLINE. If you can't be assed to do *at least* that, you're plain and simple too stupid/naive for your own good.
Crypto is anarchy. It is OUTSIDE the system, so you ned to 'fend' for yourself or lose what you have.

Buy the stable dip then wait for the whales. Set a clear goal on when to sell and don't be a fucking retard yelling
LKOOK GUIZ GREEEEE SOON MOON 1.000.000!!! HUURUEEE
Tell yourself instead that if you buy at 2k, that you WILL sell once it reaches 5k. Even if it goes from 2k to 5k in a matter of days - SELL AT FIVE THOUSAND.
150% profit earnings is *really* good.
