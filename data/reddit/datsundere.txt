They said fiat not USD.

Did I miss something? Its locked to 10k ?

thanks. Most i've heard banks offer is like 1.2 - 1.4% interest gains here in America. Does that sound right?

Whats the difference between xrp and xlm?

This. Transactions fees are stupid. The miners are getting bitcoin every 10 minutes? Why is the fee added to their profit? What happens when all the bitcoin is mined? Miners dont have any incentives to find hashes

But what if you bought bitcoins for a higher value than market? I can say I paid million for a btc

What does capital gain mean? Like you gain money by having capital?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:45:23
I'm stumped on the transaction fees rn. Way too high
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:48:32
What happens when only a few people hold all the bitcoins? The economy will still funnel all the money to the rich folds if they start using bitcoins too. Bezos will get richer and end up with more than anyone else and bitcoin is limited so people that missed out don't have any. Don't give me that bs of but btc can change value and is divisible to 1 satoshi. Can imagine how absurdly rich the first guy who got btc will be vs the last guy on earth. Ridiculous. I want to believe but it sounds implausible. I believe in omise, atleast they're starting real world application

You all just naming wallets. Which ones are full nodes? How do I not run a full node? Whats a hot wallet vs cold?

ETH isn't going down either. Get it while its not too late. It will follow bitcoins
@_date: 2019-12-19 14:19:47
Or use something that doesn’t rely on proof of work but other means like proof of stake or selection which is way more efficient. There are better technology for reaching consensus and bitcoin isn’t one of them

"Nothing else changed". Aside from exchanges getting hacked or losing millions of coins into thin air.
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:22:28
what will stop btc1 from changing the difficulty of the mining algorithm to suit their needs and generate tons of coins before anyone can join? That way the supporters can stack up the coins and also make it the defacto bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:52:17
I might just move all my btc to eth with all the drama with btc
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:56:42
I dont see gemini in the list. is that a good place to put your coins? downloading a wallet will take forever..
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:39:41
where do you store most of your coins? seems like bisq doesn't require you to validate your id

Here is the comment from the bitcoin core developer to add on 
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:26:09


If all commodities were priced in terms of bitcoin, then I could agree but right now BTC doesn't have any other base other than fiat. How much BTC should I pay for my coffee? 1 mBTC?  100 BTC?

Can someone put detailed steps to use the replay attack for research purposes? it doesn't seem like the s2x folks understand what security vulnerability can do or are planning on using it to gain profit instead. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:54:02
how did your buy bitcoin then?

And finally from the person who coined the term 'segwit':

What's interesting is, the person leading the s2x fork is the same one that led the ethereum classic fork
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:01:48
Here is some background as to why core devs don't support it: 
It's a political move to control bitcoin.

The uncertainty of losing value as well as losing your coin is there if you hold as far as I understand. Could you clarify?
