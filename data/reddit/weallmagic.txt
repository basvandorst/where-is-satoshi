So the only arguments here are "we [Core] didn't make or approve of this" and "a contentious hard fork can lead to significant confusion (potentially made worse without replay protection." I already said I don't care about A and B is preferable to me than a crippled chain with slow confirmations and/or high fees so I guess there's no reason not to support 2x.

Do these arguments hold up still, given that we've had the contentious hardfork and the divide in the community already?

i don't see more here than "potential confusion" because "hard forks are hard." I don't care about whether core supports it or not. What are the actual arguments against segwit2x?

I believe that the current state of affairs, which allows people to write things like this...
"Despite the fact that neither Bitcoin nor any of these cryptocurrencies are especially useful (on and offramping fees are insane and writing a check is more efficient in terms of transaction fees), the price continues to spiral wildly out of control with, seemingly, no end in sight."
...is damaging the brand much more than supporting a hard fork to help alleviate the issue. If we all support the hard fork it doesn't even damage the brand, it's just a mandatory "upgrade". But fine, we can't get everyone to agree... but what are the REASONS to oppose 2x? That's all I'm asking for in this thread and so far the only response has been the twice repeated "clarification" post from Core which does not list reasons to oppose 2x unless you're slavishly comitted to whatever Core wants to do.
