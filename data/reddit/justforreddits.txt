I don't know how... With BTC is easy as Coinbase does accept it but I don't want to share that many private info once again to any other exchange and no one wants to pay me cash for 1 Bcash that I have. At least I successfully separated it.
Aloo.... from two Bcash blockexplorers I get two different $ amounts ?! And I like the one that shows more but is it real?

Very bad reviews.... I'm not taking a chance...

Are you sure you used the real software? Did you make your cryptographic verification before installing it? If so how and can you teach me too?

I want to sell my Bcash flower but can't:( 
Any one can help?

Censored in my territory.... :(   So I might loose the BCH trapped money by not being able to sell it that for the market looks like "I'm holding" it which in return falsely gives the impression of lack of offer...and slows down the inevitable crash....too bad BCH!!!!

No, BTC is the one I'm in!!! That's what convinces me for a long term valuable stash - like this word - as it has standed so many attacks of all kinds from unintentional to accidental to intentional and seems to be stronger and stronger. That's my personal opinions and beliefs.....

I'm good with my btc ( cold wallet created off line ) 
I have my bcc in cold wallet sitting with some $28 of btc too. So I'll clean up that $28 and then sell the bcc that's sitting there....
Thanks again for following up with my questions....

How does this news change what Bitcoin is? The only thing it changes is the addoption time which is not important unless you deal with day trading. The impatient will not have fun with Bitcoin.

So I am a new user but before thinking of buying BTC I studied it, asked about it, compared different answers for same questions, installed a node and then bought a small piece of BTC... THEN I LIKED IT, bought more, told my friends how to educate themselves first and THEN buy if they liked it... My money that I put into BTC is earned and I continuously do care how BTC goes and more importantly WHAT MAKES IT UNIQUE!
I AM A NEW USER....and I think No2x.
