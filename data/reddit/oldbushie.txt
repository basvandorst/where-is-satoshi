Bandwidth is the main issue for me. Disk space is not a problem and RAM usage is normal. However, since my p2pool VPS node (Linux, even) has super fast speeds, it was serving ridiculous amounts of bitcoind requests until I finally gave up and blocked that port. If there were a way to constrain the amount of bandwidth used  (or heck, make it a lot more efficient) I wouldn't mind unblocking the port again. I can't afford the amount of bandwidth it was requiring.

This one is also relevant; is this Mark perhaps?
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:50:14
Fair enough. I'll just wait for further clarifications this year and amend returns as needed. I usually get my taxes done much earlier in the year than this. I'm not one of the lucky few who made millions off of Bitcoin so I'm at least low on their radar.

Bitcointalk is up for me... Freenode is still down. There's a LOT more on Freenode than bitcoin...

I have been careful to not use bitcoins for anything besides direct purchases. I have not sold a single bitcoin (or fraction thereof). I was really hoping that I would not have to be accountable for 2013 at least, which is when I first got into bitcoin. I keep seeing conflicting reports on whether I should report 2013 stuff; my tax guy says that there's no way for the IRS to effectively enforce the new Notice on past years, and that the stance is likely to change soon anyways. I still haven't filed my 2013 taxes... should I try to wade through the madness of 2013 in time for the April 15 deadline or should I just forget about bitcoin for 2013 and track from here on out? I have several hundred transactions... many of which are from mining.
@_date: 2014-02-22 16:01:30
Maybe, I don't have the full channel log since I have some stuff on automute (join/part messages for people who haven't spoken in a while). So it could be rapid nick changes happening for a lot of people, intentional or otherwise.

Not bad! A couple notes though:
1. It's Password, not Passwort.
2. "Active miners on this node" keeps getting bigger and bigger instead of updating single entries properly. But that might be because I'm on Opera 12.

@_date: 2014-03-30 09:10:00
Yeah, that is a pain. My hope is that as e-giftcards are on the rise, it will be made easier for people to be able to enter those in at registers. Shouldn't need a manager for that.
@_date: 2014-04-29 17:18:25

We have a Shopify store and I was wondering if this funding drive is still valid. It's been sitting at 36% funded for several months now and I would hope that now that Bitcoin is valued more, it could get some more forward momentum. I'd love to make our games available to Bitcoin users!

Yeah, they do sell some gift cards straight through their website and eGifter cards are definitely usable on their site. There are several that are only available in-store though, possibly to support local businesses.

My main concern is that some games aren't giftable, and I often make spur of the moment Steam purchases especially when there's a sale that ends after a short period of time. Also, I tend to buy many games at a time and it can be a pain to request multiple games at once. I do have SteamBits as one of my bookmarks just in case, though.

I'm fine with 0.0005; that currently equates to about 4 cents per transaction. I have a feeling that will trend further downwards over time, maybe 0.0002 by the end of the year. A lot of people don't realize they can change that setting in their client and just leave it at the default, which is often set rather high (by today's price) in many clients. In comparison, Dwolla charges 25 cents per transaction, so anything below that seems mostly reasonable to me, provided said transaction is a significant amount.
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:11:38
I'm definitely interested in a debit card I can use in brick and mortar stores... I take it this would be auto-converting BTC to fiat at point-of-sale (unless the store explicitly desires BTC)? If so, who's accountable for the tax end of that? Am I essentially perceived as buying purely with BTC since I'm not depositing the resulting fiat into my own bank account?
@_date: 2013-10-14 16:52:16
Ahh, so internal conflict then. So if someone *does* decide to purchase it then it will be okay. I thought maybe they pulled a BitFunder.
@_date: 2013-03-24 09:55:13
You're welcome. Hopefully Coinbase will expand out of the USA at some point, right now they're still scaling up. I'm sure there's an option out there. Perhaps you could check out the bitcoin-otc irc channel.

If you *must* try gambling, use PeerBet instead. They have no house edge at all. And the minimum is one Satoshi. Just don't bet away your life savings; even with zero house edge it's very easy for gambling to go pear-shaped.

Gyft just crashes on me whenever I try to buy anything... maybe I'll try their latest update and see if it works on my phone yet.
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:34:50
This is certainly true. And if most people agree on using the same transaction fee there won't be as many people wondering why their transaction is taking forever to go through.

As stated elsewhere, I mine bitcoins. It's not "circuitous" to try to use those bitcoins to buy stuff. It's just slightly harder than it needs to be with stuff like Steam. Plus I get 95% of my games from Steam these days.
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:39:28

@_date: 2013-03-28 08:25:05
My best guess at this point is that we're dealing with a large influx of new people, and that at the very least the BTC price will stabilize. I am definitely appreciative of vendors like yourself and am currently looking into how to do as much of my transactions as possible in BTC.

Thanks! I hadn't seen that website before; I love that it has a good collection of links in addition to the video. :D
@_date: 2013-03-24 09:50:55
EDIT: Crap, I just saw your update about not being in the USA. Yeah, right now Coinbase is only in the USA. Good luck finding a workable option!
There is a 1% fee, yes, but it's a huge convenience when trying to buy on the fly. And they cover all mining fees for BTC-&gt;BTC.
I considered Bitfloor but it would have the same delays involved as MtGox when trying to get BTC in the middle of the night. You'd have to ACH to Capital One 360 and then ACH again to Bitfloor, making for a week before you could even purchase. You could conceivably use the cash-at-bank option but that would have to wait for banks to be open and LocalTill charges 1-4%. And the wire transfer option is $15 fee (bigger than 1% unless you're making a huge BTC purchase) and slow.
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:37:27
Thanks for the review! :D I'm thinking of giving them a try for buying Steam games, for instance.
@_date: 2013-11-03 04:36:49
What's fiat?
Seriously, since I'm mining bitcoins, it would be nice to spend them once in a while on non-essentials. :)
@_date: 2013-11-03 04:05:56
Only for "goods and services" in some stores apparently, and gift cards fall in that grey area of being neither. I noticed that limitation on a number of store gift cards, including CVS and Amazon.
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:11:01
Definitely Valve, though that's not a critical service expense. ;) I do think we should all gang up on them though. I'm not very close to a Whole Foods... our closest specialty store is Wegman's. Every attempt helps, though.
@_date: 2013-03-23 23:50:52
Good luck!! At this rate I'm just hoping to trickle in more USD-&gt;BTC before it eventually hits $100 per BTC. :P
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:42:45
Phew, thanks for this! I thought that transaction got lost in time, I was worried. Good to know I wasn't the only one with this problem.
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:57:45
Any luck with this so far? I'm anxious to have a pure BTC debit card.
@_date: 2013-05-18 13:08:06
Hrm, okay. I'll try contacting them at some point to see if it would be possible. Ideally we'd like to manage everything from one storefront so we can better notify people of sales and such.
@_date: 2013-03-28 10:53:25

I confirmed this by actually going in store and buying with a gift card, yes. I also verified that you cannot do the same at CVS by asking an employee.

There's this: 
It implies that you can schedule BTC payments, though of course with this kind of subscription there's no "pull" ability on the vendor's part. Which is a Good Thing. I can see push-only BTC subscriptions being viable.

Typo on your privacy page: anonynimity
Seems like a neat service, though of course some level of trust is involved. And what if for whatever reason an order takes more than a month to ship? I would presume you send a tracking number email at least. What if you need a refund if you get something from Amazon, for instance, and it's a faulty product?

Abecedarian Bank (covers the A to Z of currencies)

That's all the good ones I can think of for now. None of those names are in use.

Coinbase. There's a way to instant-connect to your bank account, though of course you would have to wait for the ACH transfer before you see the BTC. The price you bought them at would be "locked in" for the duration of the transfer though. They're still dealing with the sudden upsurge, but it seems like their system is almost completely caught up now.
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:53:40
There are quite a few vendors that take Bitcoins, and there are even services (Bitcoinrunner, Bitspend) that will interface with normal merchants on your behalf so you can spend Bitcoins directly. They haven't closed all the loops yet, but I'm hoping to eventually pay my bills in Bitcoins.
