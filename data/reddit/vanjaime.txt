Question, how do you cash out $500K from BTC? If buying $1000 from coinbase is incredibly complicated.

Venezuelan government is not banning anything. Is just a cartel at the customs asking for being bribed if you want to get your mining equipment. They don't care about anything else but personal profit.

Thanks for your comment luke-jr, If there is no extended block... Where the signatures will go? To be backwards compatible I understand that the signatures field will be NULL so it doesn't take space on the block. Is that correct? Is there a diagram of the new segwit block structure that you can point me to? Once again thanks.

Are we talking about SegWit 2x? If the signatures remain the same how is malleability been addressed? 
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:25:16
I'm sorry, I'm confused. are you saying that the signatures are still part of the block in segwit... So, how is the block smaller of the signatures are still there? Is there a change in the way to sign the transaction that reduces the size of the block?
