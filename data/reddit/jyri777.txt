There is many, "nakamoto consensus" a.k.a POW was the first one build top of older concepts of controlling state of distributed system. Example concepts how to write in database which many people access same time and may overwrite each other if there is not some rules to avoid this problem.
Other consensus mechanisms are POS, Delegates, POC and so on. I don't know which one is the best, some tools work for other problems better than others. It is more like more different tools you have, easier it is build a house :D

Other chains may not use "nakamoto consensus". In your opinion others still can be come the "true chain". Then logically "nakamoto consensus" is not needed to become the "true blockchain". 
Purpose underlying function of algorithm might change in process. But I would like to see why original purpose was what you state as "one true blockchain"

`&gt;Compare them to the original unpretentious whitepaper; it has very simple very solid design, an analysis of attacks, and zero marketing nonsense.`
Actually I have been comparing them, by what I know I didn't found the winner. But what I found was different features and consensus mechanisms to different scenarios.
One example is ARK and its DPOS.
In my opinion, Ark's got their consensus system nailed. Evidently, it easily outperforms POW in terms of long term sustainability and scalability. More over, it offers a very good balance between efficiency, leanness and decentralization in comparison with conventional POS.
The 51 delegates are responsible for running the network. If they don't do their job properly, their voters can change delegates and this will push bad delegates out of the forging system. Another thing I love is that there are a lot of different delegates with unique proposals. Some are great for returns, there are those who are doing extra work to secure the network, you have delegates who are there for the community, delegates who focus on development or marketing. This consensus is decentralized. ARK is not run by any cartels which you may see with different projects. I might be wrong but right now I believe ARK is the only DPoS project who is doing it right.

Money is just one application of blockchain. Blockchain is just software that can be updated. It is awesome that you found out these problems. We have many objectives to take account when searching optimal solution. We can figure out some software solutions already and as we understand more the solutions can be bettered. 
The real thing in crypto is possibility to heal the root causes of problems we experience when dealing with fiat. This begins with trust to intermediary that is the root. Because this trust is exploited it causes sickness which can be seen as greedy allocation of fiat money and other data resources like purchases and id. But I am very thankful that we have invented and developed banking system as it is, lot of things in humanity work better with it. It is just that there is problems in banking system and banks and politics are trying to heal these problems by not solving the root cause but instead trying to manipulate money like printing it more. So when we develop bitcoin, we know root causes are healed. It is just these problems that follow from it that we need to solve. Bitcoin is opensource, anyone has possibility to invent and write code that implements solution. Then update.

**Lets take Eth and Btc**  
Around 1 January 2017 till this day.  
Price multiplier looks like this.  
**BTC** 741usd to 11818usd: Growth is 11818/741 = **15.94 times the original price**  
**ETH** 7.9usd to 294usd: Growth is 294/7.9 = **37.22 times the original price**

Can you argue deeper on this rather than just stating it is like this?
I would like to know

I did read whitepaper and without trying to read between lines(figure out latent concepts), i found only one mention about participation not straightly linked this. But how I understand your arguments is that we need one chain because it is most secure as all computation power will go to it,  so attacking becomes most impossible. With same logic 10 blockchains each have only 10% of computational power to use so attacker could buy only 11% worth of computation to overpower 10%.
There is couple things that counter argue this in white paper.
First is incentive, profit attacker would likely make would be better by using attacking power to honestly main new coins.
1. " The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth." \*Bitcoin whitepaper
Second problem for attacker is that he can only target his own account and transactions from there.
2. "We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent." \*Bitcoin whitepaper
So clearly 10 blockchain with 10% of computation power or participation like you put it, dosen't seem to be in such a great risk overall. Sure if blockchain is very small and can be cheaply overpowered then manipulation could happen, but then validity of this small blockchain would likely diminish as crimes would come public, lowering the value of chain and attackers loot.

I agree, Bitcoin will not replace FIAT in its current state. However in reality when we predict how things will evolve, it would be naive to consider only current state to predict future behaviour, how things will change. From here we could look how things have changed in past to this moment. We can look commit/update history of bitcoin in github. From graph we can see that past three years there is approximate avg of 40 commits per month. Compared to first three years the avg is clearly below 20 commits per month *(source).
So we clearly have doubled the amount of updates to bitcoin source code. We can see the current state is at constant shift with growing rate of change.  
Naturally banks have been securing our funds and in one future scenario they would continue to have this role as securing the btc-keys and providing secure account connection to layman. Just the underlying money would be different from fiat. This could be one synergetic system where we combine to best from both worlds, connect centralized to decentralized. Banks would naturally take some money from this service.  Example we would see if bank is manipulating our btc account to move money to its on investments. If under some bank there is lots of breaks to account, this bank would lost its trust from users in old good way. 
Banks are already mostly automatically securing our bank account keys. For me it wont seem very big leap to build system which works between btc and bankcards in secure way. These debit cards actually exist already and work just like layman has used to. *(Source 2)
Perfect security is always illusion, as it is that sub-population of criminals have resources to attack every target. So securing encrypted private keys in encrypted file, some where in encrypted instances of provider of service that has multiple copies of file in cloud.  That is something I consider safe as todays corporation standards and reality where we operate anyway. Maybe we just have opensource program that does this and returns access pin codes to hotwallets. Then connects to cold wallet when hotwallet begins to be empty. This connection could be secured by device similar to ledger nano, you cannot write in(a.k.a hack in) but only write out from device, output would be unlocking secure key for coldwallet by press of button. Basically google has just implemented this feature to android phones*(Source 3). This seems easier and easier for layman.

Tribalism is the instrict need behind bitcoin. It lives and dies with people building and using it as fully opensource software. Survival of whole thing is directly dependent on community

Banks holding bitcoin keys is small drawback for part of population, compared to everything else that Bitcoin and blockchain can do. There is lot more in Bitcoin than one single thing you can perceive. Example it is public ledger, banks own your keys or not. This public ledger means we can see and gain knowledge from all the global money transactions. This information has been secret from now. Just put some AI and Datascience to public ledger data

Should we ask if Coinbase needs helping hands to work?
