HODL and continue to buy small amounts every week

How long do you think we will be stuck in Limbo (&lt;19k)? 
When I was asked in late December what I thought the average January price would be and I said “11k”, a lot of people chastised me! IRL &amp; in multiple crypto reddits. They were easily triggered.

Alright. Maybe i’m off by a little or a lot, but I don’t see over 20k again until February. There’s too many WEAK HANDS!
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:29:35
The same thing happened to me!
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:55:25
Anywhere from 14-21k, LOL
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:55:04
Hmmm....it seems that dips are now less than 1k and they only last a day or two, it’s going up almost 2k every week since Nov. 1

I didn’t pull hear numbers out of my ass. I wasn’t rude to you!!! just a guess. You know it can’t go up exponentially if it the new number of coinbase drops in the next month!

This frenzy can’t last forever, the growth has to either slow down. If this growth doesn’t slow down in the next three months, there will be a 50% correction!

Thank you for the opportunity to buy more!!!

Yes, you need to find ways to center yourself! Add more distractions, or to clarify, activities that you sincerely enjoy doing when you are not working! Please take my advice, as someone who has suffered in the past from irrational health anxiety. Until I had i such severe rolling panic attacks every day that i had to take a benzo for 6 weeks just so I could sleep 4 hours/night. I had to gather the courage to improve my life before it became impossible. It is unhealthy to dwell on matters in life that you have almost no control over. It will only aggravate the problem and you will feel horrible to have squandered your precious time! If you have trouble changing your situation, i'd highly recommend seeing a therapist/psychiatrist. Lastly, you need to avoid dumping any $ into bitcoin that will injure your bills, living expenses, and 401k. Even the most optimistic economists advise no more than 10% of your entire savings in crypto, but I think if you keep less than 20%, you will be fine. Make sure you occasionally cash out some of your gains and pay your capital taxes.

I think it will dip further and we won’t see it substantially over 20 until February. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:26:55
Agreed 100% although I really don’t want too many people in here who intend to quickly profit on their investments; it does nothing for the integrity of Bitcoin’s future!

What do y’all think? Is this a cause for worry? Please read the article before posting your opinion!

I bought a little over .02 today! Bought at 6.7k, 7.4k, &amp; 16k as well, I am HAPPILY HODLING  even if it corrects up to 50% more; it always rebounds stronger!!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:59:09
100% with you. I’d much rather utilize btc as a strong global currency than cash out! I’d like to buy commodities, stocks, food, clothing etc with Bitcoins in the near future. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:41:54
Who else is not fucking selling?!!!
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:16:14
I bought this major dip today and am not sweating it too much! I will be buying small amounts every week no matter what the price is. I’m laughing at the people who started to buy in less than 3 months ago and are planning on selling at a loss if it continues to go down. If you invested less than $10,000 and are willing to sell for a loss very soon, you are a fool. Never put in what you can’t afford to lose. Good news is that there is permanent support at $800, bc that is roughly the cost of production for 1 coin.

This is healthy and investors should be concerned if it doesn’t correct a little further! 65% returns for Dow Jones in 2 years

I wonder if Mcafee is still absurdly bullish on BTC or if he is actually starting to get worried!
