I think you can buy from a Bitcoin ATM with your card, under a certain amount of $. There will be a high premium on it tho. That is the price of having no SSN for conbase.

Maybe they gave a withdrawl limit to non KYC people. If anything, i would not worry.... you have $159 of BTC... that is nothing hehe

Read up on using and holding bitcoin in a hardware wallet. Two hardware wallets i would suggest you look into is Ledger nano (no open source) and trezor (open source). Exchanges prey on "newbies". I do admit exchanges are needed to trade coins but when holding bitcoin or other alt coins for a longer time period, it is better to practice holding your own coins, ie: your own private keys.

I thought bitcoin was always earned solving math problems.... mining.

Edit: my comment was not helpful.
It is not advised to lock up bitcoins into the far future because it takes on risk of the bitcoin network changing. For example, if there were an ECDSA or RIPEMD-160 algorithm break that made any coins spendable with a few months of CPU time, the network might need to to prohibit moving old unspent coins after some transition, but long locktimed coins could not make such a transition.
OP_CheckSequenceVerify allows locking for at most 65535 blocks (about 455 days) or for at most 65535*512 seconds (about 388 days). OP_CheckLockTimeVerify could be used to lock up coins for centuries.

A seed and a private key are the same thing.
Edit: So no, a seed cannot have more than 1 private key and vice versa. Unless maybe you add a 25th word, which would make it a different private key (seed)

If it runs off of an SD card or able to use an external hard drive i believe you can.

"How to earn 0,0001 BTC while watching videos.
1.Turn on or uncover your webcam
2.Enter your BTC address"
Uhhh no thank you. Seems odd.

Newegg.com , overstock.com or you can put bitcoin onto bitpay app then turn it into an amazon gift card and buy one off amazon.

I personally would not trust coinomi or bitpay. That is just my gut feeling. I cannot speak on samourai or wasabi. Tho i believe wasabi does not have a mobile wallet yet, but wasabi is open source. I used mycelium for over a year, and never had any problem, not even once. Advice is to never take a screenshot of your private key.
Edit: id take first profits and buy a NEW hardware wallet. Never used. People spend more $ on leather wallets or designer bs wallets for fiat. Hell, just dont buy fast food for a month or something we waste money on and get a hardware wallet. 
You can also add a passphrase to your seed to make it way more secure.

It would be a better use of time to buy bitcoin and dream of it being 1,000,000$ per btc.

ChangeNOW’s AML/KYC procedure is supported by an automated risk prevention system. If a transaction is marked suspicious by this system, the exchange is put on hold and the customer in question is then asked to confirm their identity.

Take fiat out of your atm. Buy from a local person
@_date: 2019-01-07 04:27:34
It would have to be a side chain. Pretty sure this has been talked about since around 2016.  I do not think mimblewimble will ever be a part of bitcoin. 
Edit: we will see if Tom Riddle comments on this subject.

Not a problem. Always double check the address you are sending bitcoin to.

No, you can have infinite bitcoin receive address per seed/private key. Your address is basically like your home address where you get mail. You can move homes over and over but if you give someone your address they can send you mail/btc, while also still receiev mail from old address's Most wallets change your address auto as a more privacy oriented way of getting bitcoin.
Edit: i think you meant to ask how many wallet address can be spawned from a seed/private key, which is almost infinite. As long as you have your seed/private key you can get the bitcoin off of all address's associated with that specific seed/private key.

I do not know what you have read. And i could be wrong. I do think that a paper wallet gives you 1 address when you create the seed/private key. So, if the book you read is outdated and only speaks on a paper wallet. That is why you might be confused.
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:25:46
Lol i personally wouldnt use a vpn with logging into any crypto account. You have no idea who is reading what you send through it...
@_date: 2019-01-10 03:26:32
If binance is giving you the address then use it again. There is no need for a new one. A new one does nothing, if you are trying to be private.
