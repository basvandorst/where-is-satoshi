Already change your thoughts ? First you said scarcity was it's unique purpose. Now you admit that it's also a store of value, but not so good... 


Yeah, what are they ? A bank account ? You're kidding right ? 
1/ You can't send and receive money from/to some countries.
2/ Even if you have no fee on the withdraw itself, a bank account is not free, banks charge you for various things... (in case you didn't know) and it's not cheaper than BTC transaction cost..   


Ignorance for some, unable to have an internet access, laziness, sheep psychology..

Maybe because it's not the sole purpose of BTC ?... It's also a store of value... A good way to receive and send money...

Exactly... We haven't all the same aspirations...
