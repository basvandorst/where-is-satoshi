Coinbase isn't that bad.  I've used them for years and even got my non-tech girlfriend signed up with them recently.  I've had nothing but a pleasant experience with their support unlike the stories you hear on here.

Coinbase is a bank/business and money drives profits.  You can't spell profit$ without a $$$.

Know when to hold'em and when to fold'em.  OP is doing fine.

Bitcoin Cash was released... every noob is thinking they can buy 18k bitcoin for 3k, (now ~8500) not realizing it's BCH... Hold on it's going to be a fun ride!

Wait... when did bitcoin cash hit $2400?  I've not seen it nearly that high?

So what if I sell x amount of bitcoin for pizza (or whatever) and I pay tax on the pizza, do I owe taxes?

I had an issue once and I promptly heard back from Coinbase support.  I expected to go through the horror stories you hear about on here, but they were great at helping me out with an order that took longer to show up in my wallet.

No one knows that with certainty.

Thanks, sometimes the fingers work faster than the head.

These guys have only known how traditional money has worked over the years.  So when something new comes along they can't see its potential.  I liken it to Blockbuster who refused to see Netflix's potential.

I made the switch from Blockchain to Coinbase a couple of years ago.  I've been very happy with Coinbase.  Blockchain was just a bit "clunky" and I like how Coinbase come on this subreddit from time to time to discuss things.  Plus I trust an American based company more than a Eastern European or Chinese shop.

I think the US government is doing a fine job of destroying the US dollar.  The national debt went from 10 trillion to 19 trillion in 8 years.

You'd be a natural over in I love these kind of posts.

Any idea on when we'll hear about the ETF?

Ecuador uses the USD as its official currency.  When I was on vacation there last summer they said they had a real illegal immigration problem with Venezuelans coming over because they want those USDs.

Back up to over $1000.  Hold on mother fuckers!

What about the ones who have been holding, spending and buying?

Excellent!  Loved these commercials.

Wait... I thought bitcoin was a cute goat?

The one person that raised their hand that could explain Bitcoin was a 20-something male.

A two toed sloth.  They can be very aggressive.  Three toed are way more gentle.  Both stink to high hell.

And here I am just happy I bought in at 340 a coin.  You can gamble a buy in now or later (for who knows how much).  End of the year will be just under 2k afaik... remindmebot

Near future, probably not much.  However, remember an investment takes TIME.  If you believe what bitcoin stands for and it's premise, then you're investment is solid.  Don't buy into bitcoin if you think you'll have doubled your money in 6 months.  Just let thing play out and your investment will pay off.  It just takes some time.  And as young as you are you have time on your side.
