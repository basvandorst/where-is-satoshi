Gartley —a prelude to the crash
The imminent crypto crash starts once the following price levels are crossed below to the downside:
BTC/USD (Bitfinex): $11,651
BTC/USD (Coinbase): $12,500
Afterwards, the crash then accelerates with terminal velocity once the lows of 22 Dec 2017 are crossed to the downside.
At which point many exchanges may likely experience outages, preventing fund deposits/withdrawals and the closing/opening of positions. 
Slippages on stops/limits may also occur.
Fun fact...
Contrary to popular belief during the crash, the flight from crypto currencies and into fiat currency, is false.
The US dollar is in a bear market.
The flight to safety from crypto currencies is into gold.
Updated roadmap as of 16-JAN-2018 13:00UTC
Once the 22 DEC 2017 lows are taken out, i.e. BTCUSD 10700 on Bitfinex, the core part of the crash termed as "Fear" commences.
At which point many exchanges may likely experience outages, preventing fund deposits/withdrawals and the closing/opening of positions. 
Slippages on stops/limits may also occur. This is where the tsunami of Elliott Waves breaks the surf, where the speed of decline is at terminal velocity.
This is where man looks in the abyss, and there's nothing staring back at him. At that moment, man finds his character. And that is what keeps him out of the abyss. 
The next wave of the crash is expected to commence when $11,325 is crossed below; and, it would psychologically only just begin the "fear" stage once $10,700 is crossed below.
A speculative short position entered at $11,325 with a stop-loss at $12,100 may serve as a favorable aggressive risk/reward swing trade to ride the next wave down to approx $8,000.
A more conservative entry would be to enter when $10,891 is breached.
Prices quoted are BTC/USD (Bitfinex).
People still think this is a 'correction' and are still refusing to acknowledge a 'crash' is underway.
Can you believe the thread on Reddit still has zero votes?!
The drop through $10,700 will be shock &amp; awe, a spectacular sight to witness in human history.

Many exchanges will experience outages; that's when the 'fear' stage begins as depicted on the charts.
Anatomy of the crash: The wave structure of the core part of the bitcoin crash is exhibiting 'beautiful' Fibonacci relationships. It appears the structure of each declining a-b-c wave formation is creating golden ratio relationships where the length of the c-wave is 0.618 times the length of the a-wave. This produces short-lived, short-length, but sudden intense final c-wave capitulation points (illustration attached) —wonderful phinance! The crash is now half-way through, with core "fear" stage yet to unfold.
The next wave of the crash is expected to commence when $10,535 is taken out to the downside; and, psychologically it would represent the apex of the "fear" stage. The point of recognition and self-realisation. This is where price action is submerged within several degrees of deep fractal formations; i.e. the depths of the abyss and a seemingly bottomless chasm.
A speculative short position entered at $10,535 with a stop-loss at $11,497 may serve as a favorable but aggressive risk/reward swing trade to ride the next wave down to approx $7,116-$8,061 (or $7,588 on average). A more conservative entrance would be to enter when $9,940 is breached. Since volatility is expected to peak, exchange outages will occur; and hence, the trade suggestion is higly speculative as price action whipsaws.
Prices quoted are BTC/USD (Bitfinex).
 
As the day transitions from Tuesday to Wednesday across timezones, the Crypto market has paused taking stock of the first leg of the crash.
Since its all-time high set on 17 Dec 2017, Bitcoin has now declined 50% in value and is currently finding support at the $10000 level near the 22 Dec 2017 lows. This is an illusory psychological place where both the bulls and bears mull over their next move hoping for support or resistance respectively.
After pausing, deliberating and moving sideways for 11 hours thus far, eventually the bears are scheduled to take control. It appears the second leg, and more intense part of the crash is going to unfold during the London session were the opening bell has rung over an hour ago. Alternatively, a sideways and whipsaw behaviour to trap more buyers and sellers may extend into the US session and early Asia session. Either way, the next crash leg is looming. 
The overall grand target is an approx 78% decline with a target capitulation range of $2000-$4000. Hence, the crash is just half-way through. Another 50% decline in other cryptocurrencies suggests that many shall become extinct.
Estimate for the next level of support remains unchanged from overnight, in fact the previous trade speculative short position, is still in play. 
The second phase of the crash leg psychologically represents the apex of the "fear" stage. The point of recognition and self-realisation. This is where price action is submerged within several degrees of deep fractal price formations; i.e. the depths of the abyss with a seemingly bottomless chasm.
(See attached chart for following illustration)…
At $8061, wave-C equals wave-A in length (the larger A-B-C structure).
At $7116, wave-c equals wave-a times a Fibonacci 1.618 extension (of the larger C wave).
At $7600, represents a 61.8% decline of the entire Bitcoin market.
The average of these three price points is $7592. Hence, this represents an approx possible area of support and pause for the forthcoming second leg of the crash —naturally a place to close partial profits from a short position.
Interestingly, the wider markets are remaining unaffected. 
Initially thought there would be a flight to safety in gold, or erroneously the US dollar by misconception; however, both remain steady and even crypto stocks like NVDA are unaffected.
This is a provoking insight illustrating the small isolated footprint of the cryptocurrency market.
Just a 1000 people own 40% of Bitcoin, with them now gone, are the small millennial accounts going to support prices?
This doesn't bode well for Bitcoin, dare I say even my range of $2000-$4000 may be lofty.
Attached is a tentative look into the internal wave identification of the first Primary wave of the crash.
Should the tricky speculation be correct, it may suggest a final flush down to $8061/$7600/$7116 ($7592 average) during the early Asia session.
Guesswork of course!

Simply see a bear market in cryptocurrencies since Dec 2017 and reporting the observations and nuances. An experienced trader isn't tied to a particular market direction, trade with the flow of direction. Also notice that despite the accuracy of the observations, all posts have been down-voted —what does that say about the state of mind here at Reddit and the crypto market in general?
