I received the coins from a mining pool, so I never sent them *from* anywhere.  I'm just a novice to intermediate at cryptocurrency, but from what I can tell the sending address was in my OP: 1EeCRLCksdBRJ7SUkAAFKk1TssVv62hoTQ
Thanks for the reply.

I have already done a -rescan and a -reindex and the blockchain always reports the same thing.  Help says "This program uses Qt version 5.7.1."  Screenshots are authentic, and I can provide more.  Where do I find an uncorrupted installation to try again?

Thanks for the reply.  I will post a screenshot from Bitcoin Core showing several of the unconfirmed transactions from years ago.  Posters on the other forum were commenting many things along the same lines that it's not found etc.  Big question is if it truly isn't found then why does syncing my wallet with the blockchain report these transactions back?  There must be a way to solve this.

I guess I will have to post this on a bitcoin forum instead to see if I can find a developer.

OK, so here is the problem.  I'm not trying to *send* anything.  I mined these coins years ago, and they were sent to me through the mining pool.  I am only trying to receive them, but they're unconfirmed.
If they don't exist, why do I have detailed transaction ids, raw transaction logs etc.  What is wrong with the blockchain that it would sync Bitcoin core and send this bogus information back to me if the coins truly aren't mine?  This is equivalent to me having a legitimate ATM card going up to an ATM, scanning my card, putting my pin in seeing I have a bunch of transactions that came through, printing a receipt, going to the teller and then the teller tells me you never actually had an account here.  Um if I never had an account why does my ATM card work?  Why am I able to print a receipt showing transactions?  What is wrong with your bank that you are able to read the card and show me the ledger history, but you can't tell where my money is???

BTW, I was able to unlock this wallet using an old password in an attempt to send coins, but it still reports the balance as zero.  If this was an empty shell wallet that was never used I doubt I could get my password to work on it.  There is a reason why the blockchain is reporting these transactions into my wallet.
