He's a lot like Bush actually. He's an evangelical Christian, social Conservative and not particularly fond of what makes Canada... Canada.
Canada is governed by a Westminster style Parliament with our Prime Minister as head of Government and the executive branch (comparable to a President). Since 2006 the Conservative Party under Harper has held power in that body for various reasons (electoral fraud and lack of a viable and cohesive opposition to name a few). Hyperbole and scare politics are their modus operandi, so hence their "Bitcoin funds terrorism" nonsense.

Or we've returned to the dot-com era with massive P/E ratios, buyouts and sustained negative growth. There's gems in technology today. Cryptocurrencies are one of them. Whatsapp offers Facebook a massive user base, they could care less about the application. It's a costly endeavour for Facebook to buy and retain users for click/advertisement (fraud) revenue. But it's the only way they will survive.
The problem with saying Bitcoin is undervalued is that it's focusing on the price and only the price. Price stability and less volitility should be seen as a good thing. Not parabolic, sustained explosive growth. Facebook as an application is slowly becoming irrelevant to the social media world. Platforms survive if they deliver value or perceived value, their instances do not always share the same fate. The Bitcoin platform is revolutionary, its current instances however are not.

The issue is more nuanced then you're making it out to be considering that many countries and many regulators consider fait to BTC transactions to be suspicious by themselves. While it's true that criminals can and will use Bitcoin to launder money I think there's an expectation that regulators and finaicial authorities wouldn't cast suspicion on someone for simply transacting fait to BTC and back.

It's unlikely (and I know this comment is going to be buried). Having another method of transaction cannot save failing or flawed business models. That's not to say some sucessful companies haven't already gotten on board and that others will not in the future. It's just that no one should be overly concerned about this news.

Anymore? Not that I disagree about money laundering, just that you can't peg it on every single person who frequents this sub or uses/holds BTC.
Edit: That said I think the linked thread did raise an interesting discussion about the subject. My guess is you'll get that a lot from the libertarians here. Not that I am one but I don't think the state should have the right to ambiguously track a BTC transaction (or fiat to BTC and vice-versa) or presume that one is suspect without proof of wrong-doing.

Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Charity like all kinds of altruism is good stuff. So too is commerce. Nothing overarching like that defines Bitcoin besides what it already is; a decentralized way of looking at value and commerce through the use of technology.
TL;DR: Grown ups see the charity gamit in the same light as turning Bitcoin into credit card 2.0 (I.E the over-preoccupation of getting retailers on board).

Even then it's not as if they can disrupt the network or would have the interest (or the ability) to do so. They can put up road blocks for people trying to move fait into and out. But the true test of the network will be in what actually happens when people start turning their mining equipment off, not in how badly the exchange rate gets beat up. The regulators are not the issue. Bitcoin is much more likely to be affected by "people" like coin validators or assholes attacking the network in some manner.

@_date: 2014-02-03 02:56:31
I told you. The nature of Bitcoin is that it is a decentralized P2P network. There are certain philosophies and economic viewpoints that are favorable towards this kind of technology. But there are no "ideals" or set of principles the community follows or believes in as a whole. Your opinion holds the same water as mine until we can convince the community of an idea that gets incorporated through consensus or we 51% attack the network and take it where we want (which hopefully never happens).

That was only stopped when the Cypriot legislature voted down confiscating funds under 100,000 Euros. The 6.75% 'levy' on accounts below that threshold would have gone through otherwise.
Canada has also been in the news recently for this and it's not clear yet if our version of the FDIC (Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation) would kick in even for accounts with less then $100,000 because it's meant to facilitate in the event of a bank failure which a bail-in technically prevents.

How? I said he has a tenuous grasp meaning he doesn't have a good handle on economics, and it's more of an indictment of his politics today then anything else. Saying he's part of a group of neoliberals who are conspiring to depress and undermine the Bitcoin market to their own ends would be.
What I said couldn't be further from that nonsense. The network will surrive him and it will survive as long as it is not undermined from a technological standpoint. The fact that you can transact Bitcoin for fiat currency, like its going exchange rate, is again the least important thing about it. I forgot this wasn't BitcoinMarkets for a second so yes anything negative has to be some massive ass conspiracy meant to kill Bitcoin.

It has always done this. And will do this at different highs and support levels. If you put dumb money in, your college tuition or grocery money into BTC hoping for a payday: You just got fucked, probably isn't the first and most definitely won't be the last time.

About what?
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:55:36
I think it's a valid criticism. Most people who do online banking (a close analogy to this situation for most people) don't give a shit because if your bank information is stolen or someone charges something to your credit card the bank will reverse the charge (most of the time). And most banks have paranoid security systems. A lot of people are betting that some other kind of cryptocurrency will actually become the "gold" standard and not Bitcoin because it doesn't have inherent security features and doesn't really have much utility for small or quick transactions.
Still when you're putting $12,000 US of your own money into something, you should have some basic knowledge of it. People should know that there's no central authority or bank to reverse sent coins, unless you secure it yourself and learn it's about as open and vulnerable as leaving your physical wallet out in public.

You know that selling on Ebay/Paypal can lead to reverse transactions. You MUST have known that yet you did it anyway. And now you come to asking us to "track this guy down". I'm sorry but it's gone. Even if you track him down the police aren't about to make a Federal case out of a couple thousand dollars, to say nothing of confusing them with Bitcoin.

The way MCXNow "shutdown" wasn't really normal. The MCXFee product, most of which is owned by RealSolid (the owner and operator) is paid most of the fees (assuming here more then the currency transmission fee when withdrawing). Had he done things right he would have froze MCXFee's price, eliminated all but the base cost of withdrawing each cryptocurrencies and paid out the owners of MCXFee at least the market price for their shares, given that he released a large amount of this equity product weeks before the "shutdown". Since it wasn't closing due to finaicial stress it was wrong to allow MCXFees to languish and to charge people fees for the same reason to leave.

If our housing bubble blows up tomorrow (we are beyond the level the US was at for their bubble in '08) it will hurt the Canadian banks but be a huge blow to the Federal Government that insures so many mortgages. The real fear is that with the Big 5 so overleveraged and the Feds taking a massive loss on loans, if one or more of them start to fail there won't be any Government money on the table. The other fear is that for political reasons (the party base, vanity, contempt for Eastern Canada and "his legacy") Harper and friends would pull a Hank Paulson and let them die or more likely allow the seizure of their clients' assets even below the CDIC (100k) limit.

Yup. Your regulation is a lawsuit, but good luck trying to serve him. RealSolid's identity is unknown and while he's not a true scammer the guy has questionable ethics. I suspected all of this was just a way to pump MCXFee which seems to be verified due to it being only partially shutdown.

His argument would be valid if gold had absolutely zero value today outside its commercial applications. Until the end of time humans are going to value what is rare (and added to that what is easily fungible and transmittable), nothing is going to change that for our civilization. Yes we don't use the gold standard for currency today. Does that mean that gold is worthless, became worthless when we adopted fiat currency? Absolutely not. 
Is Bitcoin worthless simply because he sees firing up the printing presses as "progress"?

Most exchanges already do sort of serve that function. There was that Crypto Financial thing a while back. I don't know where they're at right now. Most sites that offer interest payments on BTC end up either being scams or scam-like operations like MCXNow. Two factor authentication is good but at the end of the day an offline or paper wallet is the best solution for now. Even with 2FA you're trusting the security or basic deployment of an exchange or other website. I would think the multiples, volatility and security issues of BTC would make it hard for any BTC bank to function taking losses for user screw ups, fraud and other security events.

Litecoin is not "identical".
People have Trillions in assets that are not used for basic everyday commerce yet are stores of wealth and can be transacted. Gold, platinum, petroleum and other base materials. The difference is while it can be difficult sometimes Bitcoin can be and has no storage fee and is very fungible.
Ripple is garbage and was mostly an attempt by its creators to strike it rich, like you say everyone here is only concerned with.
There are 12 Million Bitcoins in existence. If someone with a large number of these is going to freak out and panic sell, they are more likely to lose them. It's more likely they have a majority of it in cold storage and are either long on Bitcoin or bought in at an extremely low price.
Greed is not always a bad thing. And contrary to Libertarian thinking, not everyone is motivated by it.
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:06:40
I did the same as the OP and with other cryptocurrencies. Buying and selling is not wrong. But speculative buy/selling, buying beyond your means, day trading, panic selling because you bought in "too high" and buying looking for a quick payday are stupid and foolish things to be doing here. If you've lost 30-35% already, do as you wish. If you sell, stop coming back. And if you hold stop looking at the freaking charts.

There's plenty "stores" of value besides currencies that are not very stable. If Krugman were proven right then gold would be off the radar entirely. But it is still at $1200 an ounce. Is gold simply $1200 an ounce because a bunch of "guys with guns" have warehouses full of it? To me that's 16th century economic theory and doesn't describe the current order entirely.
Bitcoin may not be useful for small transactions but as a commodity and as a means of moving money around the world its got its niche. Other digital currencies may fill out other niches; quick transaction times and a network more apt to dealing with micro-transactions.
Edit: Others have also pointed out that we're not pricing things solely in Bitcoin. When you buy something almost always you're paying the US dollar equivalent in Bitcoin at the time of purchase. Yes, the merchant is taking the currency risk in accepting Bitcoin. But again others have pointed out that as the price rises and settles at higher supports, volatility decreases. If the centeral banks and Parliaments of the world don't want to create more risks for private businesses already using it, stop creating flash crashes threatening regulation or strangling exchanges out of existence. Work with the business community, the Bitcoin community the Bitcoin Foundation to ensure local regulations and anti-money laundering laws are respected.

There's a couple sites like MCXNow that offer interest on BTC deposits. "Investing" in sites that offer out loans using deposits is probably more risky then that. I think it's all a bad idea considering the multiples required to earn anything of significant value and the security issues many sites and exchanges have been having lately.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:01:07

He might have a tenuous grasp (at best) on the world of economics but the man sure as hell doesn't understand the technology. The only reason anyone listen to him today is because he's the Chief Bastard and evangelist for the Keynesians (and most of the world, post 2008 has been playing to that tune to sort of survive).
Regardless of what people like Krugman say the blockchain will keep turning. As long as the technology is not compromised and provides people a secure and effective store of value (at any kind of valuation) than digital currencies have a future.
We can mock and refute his claims. But his criticism should not be unwelcomed here. Far too many people are too caught up in the Bull and Bear war playing out here to see that.

Anyone doing this here honestly needs to fuck off.
The price while neat is not all that important to Bitcoin. If it's adopted widely at $1 US to BTC it's still useful, cool and disruptive. Same goes for $1000, 10,000, whatever.
