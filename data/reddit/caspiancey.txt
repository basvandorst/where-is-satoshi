Look up: buying on margin, fraud, 1929 Market crash, and the Wikipedia article for Economics.
If you need links I’ll provide them.

I don’t want anyone to think I don’t believe in crypto- I do. However, and I understand wanting to stay in, Tether will bring crypto to 1/5-1/10 it’s current value. That doesn’t mean ETH or BTC is dead, it means this’ll be a long, strong dip.
Keep safe out there and good luck.

Actually the auditor never audited them and never promised a 1-1 backing. The fact that they scrubbed Bitfinex and Tether from their website should be incredibly concerning to you.
But if it isn’t, the fact that they haven’t been able to provide an audit for about a year and claim to have 2.25 billion dollars is reason enough to never use Tether and be worried the price of all Cryptos are inflated.

Though I understand why watching an investment decline and rise in value with such an intense volatility would make you question your decisions, here's a good thought:
You put money into a concept that may or may not change the future. You invested (hopefully) because you believe in it and aren't just chasing returns.
By realizing this, stepping away, and holding you've actually done what a dirt poor sewer rat would never do: invest, hold, stop worrying, check another time (probably make some money, probably not TO THE MOON LAMBOS).
Take your own advice and stop freaking out.
