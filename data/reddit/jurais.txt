# number 1 advice for crypto: do not invest money you cannot afford to lose
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:49:46
Real estate is traditionally a good long term investment. Can you afford to lose the down payment?
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:56:11
that's not a trading firm, it's whales who have a ton of money starting a pump so that other people who aren't knowledgeable will jump on board and start pumping with their own money due to FOMO, then they just let all the other dummies pump and pump then they cash out, been happening for years
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:58:29
there's no definitive news, just a bunch of loose hands freaking out over bullshit like usual
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:46:24
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:42:05
There used to be one that people used all the time, but people aren't really tipping out entire coins much any more, and tbh I don't even know if that bot is up or has funds
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:36:22
they just turned it off completely it looks like
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:43:48
I'd like to see a good explanation from coinbase on what happened and why those orders made it into the books after they said the books were post only, I tested buying on the site and it didn't work. Maybe their API was allowing orders
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:12:05
Slides *checks price* above 10k. Ok then
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:40:20
5k is a crash, this is typical fluctuation.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:02:42
Coinbase saying they'd name a different fork bitcoin if it gained traction was so ridiculous
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:30:04
Coinbase does this all the time during a crash
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:30:07
yup, newcomers are scared of 15% dip *laughs heartily*
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:44:05
Evaluate the ROI 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:53:22
Verify with coinbase and just transfer into the exchange
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:59:23
which could imply that the government wants to take reign of crypto trading, which is better than trusting your crypto with some random people who are aiding in tax evasion
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:46:20
Because the name shouldn't just arbitrarily change??
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:35:36
Just too many new buyers who thought they were gonna see some immediate gains with no drops honestly
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:24:16
Fake news
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:47:48
The biggest problem with these articles is that they come out in between price swings so they almost immediately lose relevance
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:22:25
Nobody is gonna take that risk on
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:11:59
Nice fud post
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:32:52
Yeah, sure is dead...
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:30:31
Coinbase does this all the time when the market is in a correction/crash
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:00
so, trading is halted, but why is the GDAX book actively processing USD buys, I'm pretty confused on this atm 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:02:20
Any time I've sold I regretted it, unless you immediately need the Fiat just hold
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:48
If you owned BTC during the fork then you got BCH, it's not hard to figure out
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:32
sounds like fud to make the price show as $8500 on coinbase frontpage
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:50:09
Bcash is being pumped again
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:10:57
I support legitimization
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:29:53
Honestly I'm surprised they sold stock they didn't have, was it actually sold by Newegg or one of their third party sellers
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:43:57
They keep doing this shit every weekend
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:37:58
Ok and?
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:59:10
Take the twenty bucks and gamble on an alt
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:35:11
A week warning seems pretty short sighted to suddenly decide to do it
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:06:41
yeah that's pretty much everyone at this point though. I know a ton of people in real life who would constantly give me shit for having money in bitcoin, now those same people are hitting me up every day asking which coins to buy etc etc because they want a piece of the pie.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:09:26
from what I've read they haven't actually enabled withdrawals, only trading
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:51:06
That's nothing new sadly, most exchanges have a terrible support setup
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:50:26
I agree, and they are hiring, but holy shit how are they still having these problems
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:19:11
Hey man good on you, feels good to eliminate debt
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:00:30

@_date: 2017-12-03 21:44:10
This sub is getting retarded with the newcomers
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:43:41
Depends how many coins they hold
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:32:55
You must be new here
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:18:31
could be backlog on the chain, a transaction requires a certain number of confirmations before it is considered to be validated and complete
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:24:57
Yeah I moved some btc there to shuffle in alts then their verification system didn't work at all, frustrating
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:01:05
oh, I don't doubt that one bit, Coinbase is definitely in leagues with Ver after this disaster
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:11:41
If you're day trading I'd do markets on gdax, if you are just holding them coinbase is probably fine imo
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:32:55
More people coming in has helped establish stronger floors
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:03:59
GDAX is busy trying to sell coins at $8500 for fud pump orders, you aren't gonna have a good time trying to move out of it rn probably
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:06:27
If they full on cash that out they could heavily influence the price, but 100k fills would be hard to pull off at full market price imo. They would be better served to just slowly shave coins off over time, they are also rich on Fiat alone so they really don't have a good reason to not hold. If anything, they could abuse their Fiat stance, drive the price with pumps, and just slowly sell off gains from the pumps and continue the cycle. I would be surprised if they try to do a full dump all at once, they aren't idiots
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:50:49
You must be new here huh?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:20:47
fwiw GDAX did send an email, guess Coinbase didnt. Frankly IMO it was a bad time to add it, they should have given users access to that when the fork happened, not open the flood gates when theyve just added millions of new users
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:32
GDAX fucked up and was allowing actual buy orders when the order book was supposed to be Post Only, someone abused this to manipulate the price up to $8500 buy putting an insanely high sell order in way past current asking values, then putting in buys at that price against themselves, I feel bad for any newcomers who got suckered into buying at $8500
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:32:26
I don't have strong faith in moving anything to them as temporary "Fiat"
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:49:24

Lightning network
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:04
Coinbase sent out multiple emails and posts that they were adding bcash, what's shady? They probably should not have added it during a blatant pump though. Coinbase is clearly backing Ver manipulation
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:40:59
I've done some alt moves during the day with some success, you could also try to game arbitrage
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:45:33
There isn't a bubble. If you want to play safe, buy ltc or eth, eth particular is still undervalued. If you really want massive gains though you'll almost have to play alts, which can be risky but would give you massive returns with the amount you can secure. Powr or iota aren't bad choices, but you should do your own research on alts before buying in
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:02:30
Asian trend is nothing new, daily adjustment since forever

@_date: 2017-12-05 04:54:40
Do you believe bitcoin isn't already heavily manipulated??
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:10:34
this is the August 3rd email, its probably gonna get mangled in formatting cuz reddit:
Dear Coinbase customer, 
We wanted to give our customers an update on the recent Bitcoin hard fork. You can read more about what a digital currency fork is here:
Forks enable innovation and improvements to digital currency and we believe that we will see an increasing number of forks in the future. We expect this to be a vibrant and innovative community.
When a digital currency forks, it creates a new digital asset. Adding new digital assets to Coinbase must be approached with caution. Not every asset is immediately safe to add to Coinbase from a technical stability, security, or compliance point of view. 
Our top priority is the safety of customer funds and we spend extensive time designing, building, testing and auditing our systems to ensure that the digital asset we support remains safe and secure. We may not always be first in adding an asset, but if we do, you can be sure that we’ve invested significant time and care into supporting it securely. We believe this is the best approach for us to maintain customer trust.
In the case of bitcoin cash, we made clear to our customers that we did not feel we could safely support it on the day it was launched. For customers who wanted immediate access to their bitcoin cash, we advised them to withdraw their bitcoin from the Coinbase platform. However, there are several points we want to make clear for our customers:
Both bitcoin and bitcoin cash remain safely stored on Coinbase.
Customers with balances of bitcoin at the time of the fork now have an equal quantity of bitcoin cash stored by Coinbase.
We operate by the general principle that our customers should benefit to the greatest extent possible from hard forks or other unexpected events.
Over the last several days, we’ve examined all of the relevant issues and have decided to work on adding support for bitcoin cash for Coinbase customers. We made this decision based on factors such as the security of the network, customer demand, trading volumes, and regulatory considerations.
We are planning to have support for bitcoin cash by January 1, 2018, assuming no additional risks emerge during that time.
Once supported, customers will be able to withdraw bitcoin cash. We'll make a determination at a later date about adding trading support. In the meantime, customer bitcoin cash will remain safely stored on Coinbase.
Thank you,
Coinbase Team

Correction will happen, newbies will panic sell like dummies, we'll all buy more before they catch the dip, the usual
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:19:26
GDAX order book is open to view.
Someone put a large order sell at $8500 then somebody (read, the same person who put the order in) started filling the order at $8500 to artificially push the price to $8500 on the coinbase frontpage. It's blatant manipulation, the price is completely frozen because nobody is buying at $8500 when its $3300-$3500 on every single other exchange except for the guy trying to fud the price. Now everyone who got BCH today is trying to cash out at $8500 too and adding fuel to the fire.
GDAX should suspend trading.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:21:20
yeah tbh I thought they were only allowing cross-coin trading of BCH atm
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:12
GDAX is supposed to be in Post Only mode on their order books, not sure why there are orders coming in for it at $8500 usd, if someone has a clue on that lmk
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:49:19
The title is very misleading click bait

Bad timing also with the explosion in sign ups etc
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:58:34
Don't stress it, you will need to use an exchange if you want to day trade, bittrex might work for Canadians
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:48:23
$500 fluctuation is nothing, if that scares you then bitcoin isn't where you should be
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:11:20
At least they actually have support now, it used to be much much worse if you can imagine that
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:23:18
Fiat does
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:37
this sub has been pretty toxic for awhile unfortunately
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:53:23
Sorry buddy just misread it
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:48
They originally said 'before end of the year'. Coinbase is clearly in bed with Ver though, convenient to go live during a bch pump
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:43:29
Eventually maybe, but given current drive sizes I wouldn't worry
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:44:47
If you do not control the private keys for those coins when the fork happened then you are at the mercy of wherever you had them stored as to whetehr they are exposing those to you
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:32:09
Regulation establishes legitimization, nothing but positives
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:48:49
Potentially, but the legitimization outweighs everything else
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:51:56
Coinbase was very open and public that they were adding BCash support before the end of the year dude. It's being pumped as usual
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:30:37
Their exact words from the email in August was "by 2018"
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:20:15
Correction has been in the wings for awhile man
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:57:50
Hope you can one day be open with everything and embrace who you are openly
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:17:53
They sent out emails July 7th and August 3rd
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:48:25
Interesting, if you've already invested coding time I'd say keep at it

@_date: 2017-12-05 00:14:48
It's pretty ridiculous that they basically hold your coins hostage
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:02:13
Don't have weak hands, dips will correct, don't invest what you can't afford to lose
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:09:50

Bitcoin is crashing dude, end of times
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:28:54
Idk maybe if someone opened an escrow service, but imo it's just too risky, you're gonna be open to manipulation regardless. If btc suddenly had a five grand run up I'm sure anyone who just used some to buy something would start trying to weasel it back.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:24:49
dont use it. Bitcoin.com is owned by a guy who pump dumps bcash, you'll probably end up with a bcash address that screws you over when you try to use btc

@_date: 2017-12-20 00:59:32
Do you not read your fucking emails?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:52:45
I wouldn't put in a large order during a movement, you can easily get stuck trying to have the whole thing processed while the price is all over
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:25
that shit's gone
@_date: 2016-03-15 01:51:05
it is way too late in the game for mining on anything other than a multi-asic rig

it's coming from all sorts of random usernames -_-
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:04:38
Weak hands selling when it takes a $60 plunge in a week after hitting the highest point it's been in awhile, those aren't weak hands, those are smart people seeing bitcoin falling apart thanks to infighting, ceos leaving, and large exchanges hiding massive breaches for over a year
@_date: 2016-01-13 09:40:28
Would this have had a hand in the dip yesterday
@_date: 2016-03-05 03:01:08
welcome to bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:32:51
yeah, can someone clear up what the fork will mean for existing coins in tl;dr;?
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:49:30
You'd probably have to BS your reason for taking out a loan, I doubt any financial institution is gonna hand you $5000+ if you walk in and tell them you are planning to buy some bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:21:28
I don't know for BCC tbh
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:35:08
yeah it's only at 8300 on gdax

You can definitely game the differences if you want to go that route - 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:01:38
"crashed to 8100", you don't understand the term crash man
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:45:31
my mistake then, thanks for the further information
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:46:46
$400 at 7k isn't a worry
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:31:41
Coin base is being fucking retarded
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:26:25
Coinbase is extremely slow to integrate forked coins
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:01:41
You can't withdraw btc from coin base am either, so unless you proxy through eth coin base is totally fucking everyone
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:12:11
This is fud extreme
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:42:04
not the best article when there's reaction to bch pump driving it down, fwiw
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:25:33
Yeah it's apparently happening all over from cb 
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:41:57
vague fud post with zero actual information to back up claims, good shit post
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:22:39
yeah, BCH lost a TON of value once the pump ended, if you're gonna try to play that game you better have market orders in to sell that shit off when the fall happens again
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:02:02
the resistance had already been wittled down earlier today, wall just fell apart
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:33:55
There is massive resistance at 7k

@_date: 2017-11-24 08:16:23
I've just seen it mentioned quite a bit, could be fud posts from people trying to seed disarray, dunno man
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:57:01
coinbase fees are generally pretty high, I just use GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:31:21
Wish I could, moved coins into bittrex not realizing they won't let you even move your coins back out of their exchange without being verified. Gonna be riding this one out for now
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:49:04
Nice fud post
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:40:14
fwiw Virustotal scanned it as clean

It's an ad
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:04:12
Idk I'd buy into bch but with that test transfer stuck I'm just gonna stay in Fiat and not risk similar issues from them with eth
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:06:44
good thing this sub is well moderated...
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:56:59
Welcome to Bitcoin, if you're scared of that happening then you need to just pull out and not look back
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:16:49
welcome to coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:07:46
My best advice would be to setup market sell orders or alarms if you're gonna go for it, I almost moved a few btc in then decided to just go to sleep, woke up and it had dropped half it's value. Catch the early pump if you wanna gamble or just hodl as usual
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:56:49
Dip earlier from bch pumping
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:08:11
Yeah it's painful that there's no access to bch there right now
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:58:09
Thanks for the constructive post
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:56:23
The frustrating part is that it doesn't look like it's even due to transaction congestion, coin base isn't even trying to send it
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:11:18
it was below 7900 just a bit ago, there's some BCH pump action going on that'll force some dippage
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:58:50
I saw the commercial for it, looks like they find an old wallet and are trying to crack it or something like that
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:47:22
whales could be shuffling into BCH for the quick gains thanks to the korean pumping
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:17:02
that moneys gone my man
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:00:58
Bitcoin isn't a tax haven if you cash out, nothing new here
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:13:22
kinda lame that it's taking them this long to implement BCH, but when 2x was on the horizon they were quick to start talking about switching which fork they would call 'BTC'
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:45:41
This is nothing for coinbase, they used to go down all the damn time
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:52:34
You must be new
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:49:13
BCH is setting a new all time high every minute
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:59:06
We there fam
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:31:10
Probably their Bank, mine blocks coinbase because of the country of origin, have to call whenever I'm making a transfer
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:18:57
It's worth controlling your keys
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:21:01
I know in the past that I've had issues transferring through Coinbase via my cards because of their country of origin, as a heads up to anyone looking to go that route. I usually just call beforehand and make sure the card is whitelisted for any transactions.
I know Coinbase has or is in the process of allowing immediate transfers via bank transfer though, I just don't think all accounts have it yet, presumably only accounts in longer standings got it at start. I love Coinbase just wish they could step up their game on handling network issues / support response. Last time I had to reach out I got a blanket response that didn't even answer my question from Coinbase, then Gdax took 4 days to even respond.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:06:37
lightning network?
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:05:39
the fact that it's holding above 7 is a good indicator
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:50:34
difference alignment on which fork should survive, mods on both sides silencing meaningful discussions that don't align with their visions, etc. I take both subs at face value, there are agendas in both corners
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:08:30
There's no Bitcoin fork coming
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:44:35
Read your email ffs
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:47:19
BCH is up over 100%, and still being pumped, worse investment calls you could make
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:34:07
Coinbase sure as fuck is not gonna refund you for a bad financial decision
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:32:28
episode airs tonight I believe, so probably will
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:36:15
43% of active volume is coming from same exchange that was pumping last pump
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:55:25
Ok and? Welcome to how trading money works
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:15:27
I made a withdrawal last night and they haven't sent nor announced it on the block chain, there's some fuckery going on over there
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:00:15
Look at the market volume, it's extreme Korean pump, they have traded 1.2b more than the next closest exchange
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:13:03
Gdax used to be way worse, you must be new here
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:39:20
volume is coming from korean currencies, fwiw
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:21:09
It's the same as the last bch rise, magic pump out of nowhere that'll eventually bubble off
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:38:02
oh hey it's a shitpost
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:20:47
yeah a correction was inevitable, it'll bounce back, don't panic sell at a loss
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:23:59
the BCH pumps have seen a massively weighted amount of volume coming from a Korean based exchange, which suggests it is coming from asia, but there is also strong opinion that while coming from there that it's also being heavily influenced by Ver etc
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:22:43
Market volume for reference 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:24:57
They haven't made a transaction. There is nothing pending confirmation to the address
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:43:42
Coinbase emailed every member about it, they're trying to support the fork
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:02:22
7800 fell on gdax and bittrex, starting to slide back as orders dump in tho
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:59:47
You just said it was wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:22:20
Majority of the bch pump is coming from Korea, it's probably artificial pump to drive price up
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:36:03
I don't expect it to affect prices
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:53:37
makes sense, I mean we all had seen rumors that this round was on it's way so makes sense timing wise
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:41:04
yeah, some people managed to sell at 7900 so they made the right move, if it crashes below 7000 it's gonna be a blood bath
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:15:50
Idk I'm not sure I'd buy during an ath run, if price was idling sure, but it's up 400 since I woke up
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:08:15
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:33:26
FYI I made a small withdrawal out of GDAX into Bittrex, GDAX shows transfer as complete, but it is definitely not showing in blockchain yet, so not sure what crap they're trying to pull now
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:01:00
the GDAX order book charts are a good way to visualize buy/sell walls if you pull them up
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:09:06
Price hike makes it technically more profitable to mine 
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:48:39
And no shit there's a dip from an ath, that's how the market works. Ath = people and market orders cashing out in droves and immediately correcting the price
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:25:28
BTC is only real BTC, hell yes it is
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:44:53
I mean, think about what they'd have to deal with if they were gonna return btc, you'd definitely have people trying to game them. Buy some 1080ti card, btc price suddenly sky rockets, run back to Newegg wanting a refund. They aren't trying to become an exchange for you to tie coins up with
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:17:29
they invested knowing full well that it was a gamble, that money is gone, investing doesn't have a parachute to bail you out if things go south
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:29:24
It was just people trying to pump eth and mass spamming about it, I said fuck it and bought some eventually at dirt cheap
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:47:09
Shit, 5800, five mins later 5500
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:47:52
Nobody can accurately answer these kind of questions with any certainty
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:48:32
If you can't afford a date without your Bitcoin you need a financial advisor
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:37:48
read their post
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:22:14
7800 was excitement over unification, subsequent dip was people sad for no free coins, current dip is bch pumping
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:03:10
Panic on a small shift is lol
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:32:50
massive walls leading up there
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:09:16
My low support floor guess would be 4500 in the most extreme
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:46:09
why do people post these articles that aren't even relevant to current state of things? crypto moves way too fast for articles being posted 24 h later
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:02:30
could happen, I expected $7000 to hold but it just fell on gdax
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:39:32
you'll be at the mercy of the exchange in terms of when you are able to actually get your forked coins, which can sometimes mean you miss out if the exchange drags ass on implementing support
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:18:32
$100 limit? I don't think I've ever had a limit that low there
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:47:57
Bitthumb is the exchange that cash uses for fud dumps, who cares
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:13:22
S2X might be cancelled so
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:17:05
(either way, Coinbase locks your price in even if you have to do a bank transfer for the funds, so if you bought the dip via bank transfer you'd still be in at the price of the dip, you just lose the leeway of being able to get the btc back out if price starts tanking in the interim)
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:15:17
gdax is fighting 5900 atm
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:52:20
You didn't lose anything until you cash out, 1 btc is still 1 btc.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:32:50
1 btc = 1 btc
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:37:21
Yeah there seems to be strong support at 8
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:06:34
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:21:22
it could spike to 10k and this  be a crash in the future, nobody knows man
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:05:02
might happen, $6K just fell on GDAX, massive sell waves are flooding in
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:12:43
Good start but other exchanges offer more currency and better fork support
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:19:52
Past 3 years there has been very little fluctuation directly tied to it being black friday, so take that for what it's worth. Cursory glance at some charts suggest it actually tends to see a small increase on BF
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:16:04
Last attack lead us into all time high, who cares
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:00:20
Why does a place handling billions of dollars daily have so much security involved??
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:59:18
Standing rumors this week have suggested another pump attempt over the weekend, good chance you could catch the start and cash before the dump. Today's pump did not sustain nearly as long as last time
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:17
Nice fud post
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:41:29
fud alert extreme
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:21:04
it barely dipped then kept going up, there was no major dip
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:03:25
Bitcoin probably isn't what you should be buying
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:50:45
Split is not happening
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:44:40
Yeah it is news worthy, but the news in the header of the article you posted isn't even accurate of the current state of affairs
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:50:30
There is no way you did not get the email, both coin base and gdax sent it out. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:38:23
they won't
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:21:42
I would say the fact that they are not processing BTC withdrawal requests  atm (past 24+ hrs?) and are sticking the coins into 'Pending' status and not submitting the transfers into the blockchain is pretty damn sketchy. How does coinbase still not have 24/7 support coverage, blows my mind.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:19:31
Yeah you want gdax, coinbase isn't for active trading
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:44:49
the spike was caused by the 2X cancellation, dip was probably people selling who were only holding BTC to get free extra coins, was a guesstimated 10% profit to be made for free
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:36:30
yeah I checked, same issue showed up
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:42:02
people wanted free money, now they arent getting it
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:46:38
Coinbase probably hasn't actually made the transaction yet so it's not in the ledgers
Block chain.info is good for looking up things
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:04:15
Getting there, I still believe we can make 10 by end of year
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:46:29
The exchange they are funneling into has no fees, so they're just fud pumping the price with no incurred loss, then dumping and leaving people who followed the trend SOL. I guarantee there are people in the sub who tried to hop on the train and took heavy losses cuz the dump came quick. If you didn't have solid market orders in to cover your ass you probably got fucked
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:20:35
ya I really don't understand how they have such a terrible support system still too, like how does a group with that much money not have 24/7/365 support available, support tickets are 'we'll respond in days' and twitter is 'maybe some intern is online'
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:31:49
It's telling that nobody caught the issue, where was the actual testing
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:43:11
Hence lightning network??
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:20:27
Overall value is significantly higher than when that fork happened so
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:06:35
non-amp link: 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:43:41
to my understanding their hard fork is not generating a secondary coin, just a divergence for technology improvement
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:26:40
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:28:45
Are you buying an asic?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:34:56
better hodl
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:53:12
Good call that would probably work
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:48:00
I'm curious to see how Asia reacts, there's strong resistance at 7k still
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:54:34
yeah, I almost bought some BCH as the pump went on, woke up and value had dropped significantly, dodged a bullet on that one
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:03:45
Nobody is making you buy btc, just go play in the alt coin kiddie pool
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:47:39
Btc is up from last night so
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:34:13
there is MASSIVE dumping going on on gdax
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:11:44
100$ isn't a bit
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:02:13
The bcash fork isn't generating a new coin right, just forking for tech change?
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:36:32
Yeah they need to stop dragging ass on fork support, people who couldn't get out during the weekend pump are probably pissed
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:42:26
great as the article sounds the fact is it almost immediately started a rapid descent to sub-morning levels once it peaked out
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:48:57
Their support has always been notoriously slow 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:02:23
the support got hit due to BCH pump, if you really want to take a hard gamble you could try to buy bch during pump and get out before it falls under itself during the dump, if you plan to go this route I highly advise that you set up auto sells cuz it will probably happen during a late evening
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:34:31
took 14 hours for me to transfer funds out of GDAX this weekend
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:50:08
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:02:42
Nobody is panicking except shaky hands
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:12:47
It's down a hundred bucks, that's not a free fall
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:07:20
The bch bump is almost entirely coming from Korea
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:00:38
There are zero Amazon crypto rumors with any legitimate backing
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:21:12
Bitcoin corrected from a rapid rise, happens all the time
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:11:46
doesn't look like pullback
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:26:13
The only reason anyone is selling is to cash out long term gains, there is nothing to panic about
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:24:58
why are you spending money you can't afford to be without?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:38:25
You should be able to look up the wallet address and see what's in it
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:48:49
Yeah, people going all in at an ath then coming here panicking over a hundred dollar drop is getting old
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:14:47
The entire episode is about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:46:48
think it's just usual gdax capacity issues, it's not consistently refreshing on my end
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:09:40
Coinbase can be so to respond to questions but I'd consider it safe, ultimately you should control your keys
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:43:49
I feel bad for everyone missing out on the pumps to cash out
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:30:31
there is still a small group claiming they plan to fork and activate, but the primary S2X development team has said they are putting things on hold, you may get some free coins still but without the large backing don't expect any large free money gains out the gate
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:32:48
you definitely make some tradeoffs for convenience with the coinbase sites, overall I still recommend them though
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:15:59
Are they doing instant payments on all accounts? I was of the impression it was only enabled on a subset currently. FWIW credit card payments have always been instant from Coinbase though
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:50:57
come up with a legitimate use case for why you would need to take a small loan out, maybe you have some school loans to catch up on or something?
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:35:36
how many bitcoin coppers for 1 reddit silver
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:24:21
I really wish GDAX had implemented BCH support by now just so I could more easily move btc to bch and vice versa without having to send into another exchange
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:25:42
implying coinbase has a worthy support system to contact
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:44
Welcome to coinbase
Nobody here should be surprised
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:37:14
There's been strong resistance at 7k, it's been under constant pressure but keeps bouncing back, if you don't buy before the fork then you miss out and have to pick one or the other, so really up to you
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:19:16
Use an exchange that supports it?
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:11:02
If this is cause for panic then crypto is not for you
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:51:37
It's called a correction, it was bound to happen
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:30:49
8k is a large wall to break through, gonna take awhile before the people with faith and hodlers can get through it
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:09:39
yeah probably the same pump and dump bullshit
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:59:00
Could be
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:10:28
Yeah, some slow transactions sure, but they aren't even passing the transactions, which makes no sense of their exchange can actively do them
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:10:46
they maintained the pump for a couple days last time, they're using a fee-less exchange to pump
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:25:13
man it's all over the place right now
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:23:30
S2X officially cancelled, to the moon dude
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:58:42
You aren't enjoying any fork coins if you're in coin base
@_date: 2016-02-14 01:17:45
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:39:24
Cuz 19 year olds are worth listening to
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:15:42
obviously there are major influencers on the market, look at how much of the chain china controls
@_date: 2017-10-21 07:45:37
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:57:04
Honestly I think the 5k drop was just sell orders, current drop is definitely panic
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:42:38
yeah I was surprised how high they hit
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:01:20
Yeah check it out now buddy
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:08:17
you can stop posting fud, thanks bud
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:01:52
Op probably got hacked and ran to Reddit as if we can manually return his money
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:58:55
Just hold man, you'll make it back
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:33:21
If they flat out block 'all' crypto, expect a dip. It will recover in the longterm, but will definitely have impact due to panic, the previous announcement was only around ICOs
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:10:04
ICOs have done a great job of ruining rising prices
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:48:34
there is nothing about crypto/btc in any of their earnings releases or slides, so I'm not counting on anything coming out during the call
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:14:01
the Chinese Congress started this week, so far I haven't seen any statements directly about crypto, but this would be a strong time when China could swing to a strong chance on crypto on the whole, and unfortunately they still have a strong influence on the currency value
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:08:17
you can stop posting fud, thanks bud
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:02:57
I would take regulation as a good thing personally, it shows that China will longterm support BTC in a positive fashion
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:54:08
The thousand marks are full of sell orders
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:01:10
hopefully no dump if chinese congress goes south
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:08:26
Nobody cares
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:58:51
it was due to correct eventually a bit, I'm waiting to see what comes out of China
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:55:14
math looks right to me, $100 of btc at $4271 is only 0.02341~ BTC, 0.02341 * $6000 is ~$141, not sure where the confusion is. You aren't going to be making large profit in BTC without large investments at this point
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:38:01
just plowed past 5600
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:12:52
aren't there already massive sites doing the same thing?
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:35:04
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:15:36
coinbase support has been helpful for me in the past, but holy shit do they take forever

I'd wait there's a dip happening
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:32:45
nothing in the slides about btc, maybe someone will ask in the stream
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:54:58
depends on where you were storing the coins, if you had them in an exchange youll need to see what they said about it
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:08:29
stop posting panic sell bullshit articles?
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:42:31
been a slow climb, no news out of China yet as to whether chinese congress is going to go full regulation or not
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:57:04
Honestly I think the 5k drop was just sell orders, current drop is definitely panic
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:58:48
oh boy, fud
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:01:10
Eth is holding it's price better than btc atm, js
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:14:42
fork is estimated to happen in 12 hrs atm
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:02:48
They're also talking like asshats in response
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:21:18
yeah, I'm not sure how anyone would expect they would refund you bitcoin with it being a volatile market
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:21:48
That announcement came way earlier in the day, atm you should be following Chinese Congress news
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:17:08
I've heard 25th based off developer discord talk
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:42:42
it had a change in the short term regardless of the bounceback, shaky hands will panic and cause a dip after buying into the CHINA BANS BITCOIN posts
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:09:07
I thought the fork is targeting the 25th
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:16:06
Breaking past the 5k wall was an important boundary
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:09:47
Yeah coin base drags their feet on making forks accessible
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:08:49
they've probably already pulled the funds and are waiting for your bank transfer to complete, welcome to using bank transfers with coinbase
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:37:30
today is probably not the best time to buy in tbh
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:01:56
coinbase is starting early and locking July 31st apparently
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:14:06
if you're comfortable with coinbase holding your USD I would just do some transfers into your instant wallet so you can move money around, or start using GDAX instead for high volume trading, if you hate the limits now you're gonna hate the buy/sell limits if you try to make moves
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:26:20
Alt coins will probably dip across the board as BTC dips leading into the hardfork, I haven't heard of any exchanges halting specifically non-BTC transactiosn, though I'm not sure how things will play out with BTC transfers locked up. There is a good chance that it would be wise to pull your alts into USD and buy the dip, but frankly nobody can tell you for sure that's gonna happen or not gonna happen, up to. Things will probably bounce back so I wouldn't panic either way.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:12:57
tl;dr; you probably don't want your coins in an exchange on august 1st, a good majority of them are halting all transactions while they wait to see what happens with the hardfork
@_date: 2017-07-18 01:43:30
nobody can 100% predict the market
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:20:48
use a local wallet
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:07:45
yeah I agree, but coinbase just put up a giant banner on their site about it so who knows if they'll turn face
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:15:34
can you afford to lose that $2100? if so, keep it
