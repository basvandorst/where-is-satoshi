"Bitcoin has the opportunity to decouple the economic world from the political world."
Brilliant observation. Bitcoin is inherently apolitical.

This is why I never verified at bitstamp either. Left .08 coins there...

That's because he's a Randian A-hole.

It's called a tear sheet, and yes.

He's not "pro-bitcoin." More of a wait and see approach coming from him.

Just sent $1.

From the guy that sold something worth nothing for billions...

I think the finite supply might make it tougher, but I can see a company like lendingclub.com for BTC. Why not?

That's quite timely, since certain members of my family were mocking the "great nation-state diplomacy of the Basque" after bumping heads with a stubborn Spanish in-law this week. :)
Regardless, I'm looking at Graeber's book, however; I'm of the belief that Debt is very useful and beneficial if managed correctly.
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:46:50
Ah, ok... A bit misleading site.
@_date: 2013-12-29 14:58:02
It's called "trolling."
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:48:31
I definitely wouldn't call myself a libertarian, though I do have that streak. I think Ron Paul is a (mostly) whackjob and Ayn Rand was a monster, however; I do see the need to hedge against "Keynesians gone wild."
I really don't complain about "fiat," but I do hold precious metals and bitcoin. All of my PMs and BTC amount to less than 10% of my net worth.
In addition to the need to hedge/diversify, I do see bitcoin as a viable digital payment network and would love to invest in BTC related companies. 
Bitcoin has not even started creating wealth yet (and I'm not talking about the price).

how come every article about bitcoin uses images of physical coinage?
Where do I get one?

Yeah, I suppose you are right, just looking for a way to build up BTC without having to play dice.

While you are at it, explain what a dollar is....
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:40:34
One thing that annoyed me was that Peter kept harping on the transaction fees...
He's under the assumption that BTC holders will NEED to convert to another currency. I think the point is that spending BTC is as important as owning it. He's looking at it as a commodity like gold and not a currency, thereby, missing the point completely.
If I were to get $1M worth of BTC, I would try to spend them and avoid tax issues. Why do you need to convert to USD?

Lending is never a terrible idea if the structure is correct. That site does not exude confidence "Comming soon"

Same boat.
I'm holding a bunch of silver and a little BTC. My time frame is long, so not too worried, just wish I had more BTC.

1. Buy low, sell high. 
2. Buy in scale, sell in scale. 
3. Never risk more than you can lose.

Would you hold $1 trillion in cash?
Those coins get spent on the way up. Diversification at the very least
