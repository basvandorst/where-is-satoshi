This guy sold at the bottom
@_date: 2014-06-04 02:26:38
He never even sells he just moves his wall as the price moves...
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:37:26
Then go move on to something you believe in...
@_date: 2014-06-04 02:09:25
Lol hes been moving that wall around for days...
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:56:22
Telling us what we already know? The source called my brain told me this as well...
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:10:00
Exactly. Its the one factor of Bitcoin I worry about, especially when its price is higher and more coveted. How will people keep themselves secure at all times? We may pay through banks but at least they are a trustworthy source to hold our wealth, rather than body guarding it ourselves.

Cold storage...
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:09:33
Looks like zero to limited fees and extremely convenient. Why is this not a better solution than going through the headache of acquiring and sending bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-16 12:36:29
Because they know you sold at $550...
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:28:55
How would they not face the same problems they do with their own setup?
@_date: 2014-09-24 00:11:42
I got the same email...
@_date: 2014-12-14 00:07:44
I'm confused. It's not going anywhere as in it is here to stay or it isn't going anywhere because it's not useful?
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:53:18
Do they ship to Canada?  
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:20:59
$10 in the next five minutes.
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:33:31
Why to reassure you? There isn't enough information out there for you to read and draw your own conclusion? (Which it seems you already have).
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:36:39
Thanks but that doesn't look like something your everyday Joe can complete seamlessly with no issues.
@_date: 2014-09-26 23:59:42
Are trezors really full proof safe? I haven't heard much feedback about them...
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:45:26
Yes. Bitcoin is doomed. One flash crash because of a noob-run exchange means its going to 0. People...
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:29:25
$10 in five minutes
@_date: 2015-04-11 03:55:22
Don't do it man, it will change your life...
@_date: 2015-04-15 02:20:13
You dont have to own or have owned bitcoins to try to feel rich or elite. Some people dabble in them for the interest and potential of it. Dont have to go so far with a pretty harmless observation.

Is the bear market over?
@_date: 2015-04-11 03:30:44
@_date: 2015-02-28 03:48:09
FWIW...I downloaded firmware update recently, saw this, double checked and it's fine...just for anyone being scared by this...sounds like a glitch that will be rectified...
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:57:04
Why is this important?
