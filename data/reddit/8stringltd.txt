actually not to poop on your party but if you've got economic hardship given the potential Bitcoin has, the last thing you should do is sell it to buy Xmas Presents. that .02 in 2 Years from now could be like hitting 5 numbers in the lotto or something. Just saying.

Hmmm, I have to disagree with you right here, its very easy to make a dumb comment like this but as much as you might hate on ripple, the FASTEST and CHEAPEST way to send over a transfer as of today is Using XRP. Bitcoin might be our Flagship but as flashy and bold as he is, he is outdated, slow and very very expensive.
