This just sounds so incredibly cocky and greedy to me. “We want to be in the middle” just sounds like “we want to control” to me.

Coinbase has a wallet, honestly thought that was all I needed. Trying to find good ones, coinbase was almost always in the top 5-10 wallets recommended so I went with what I thought would be good. Started doing that long before I knew there was a sub and before I even used reddit much at all. There is definitely a wealth of info here and far less bias than your typical “top ten” lists on the internet. Better late than never.

Just downloaded Electrum which lets me control the fees. Slower transactions = lower fees, faster transactions = higher speeds. It’s good to have that control.

I try to use it immediately, sending it as soon as I buy it to the wallet of the site I’m using to purchase goods. So I’ve never really had a reason to use an in between service but I’m now rethinking that plan.

Thanks for the reply. I’m still learning as I go and it can be very frustrating to deal with but it’s the only method of payment these sites accept so it is what it is. Just trying to make things a little easier and less fee-intensive. I don’t usually have much cash to put into it so I buy the amount I need and go from there but I’m the end it ends up costing me an arm and a leg so it might be worth it to just add $10-20 to my needed total just to ensure I can cover fees and whatnot and then let that sit in a wallet and grow (hopefully) or at the very least be there to help absorb fees for the next transaction. I’ll definitely be looking into another wallet.
