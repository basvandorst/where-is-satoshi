instead of focusing on making btc a better product with increased usability, people hear focus on character assassination...

you only bother looking for things to support your narrative, you never spend any time validating whether it is true or not

Yes anyone running an LN node will comply with the laws to be able to run long term

there will be a state-backed attack on LN hubs and everyone already knows this. KYC AML will force LN hubs to turn into banks.. HOW DO PEOPLE NOT SEE THIS

Ok, hey anyone can spin up an LN node, so why don't you spin one up, run it for months/years and see what happens with you and the law. You'll be functioning as an unlicensed money transmitter.

i agree, The institutional money just got on board and the first thing that happens is a big sell off. Recover, and moon... but BCH throws a fork in it

or maybe you can set it to ping you after the 3rd or 6th confirmation depending on the deposit requirements of the service you are using. and maybe it could have an estimator depending on where you are in the que. And if the mempool gets flooded with fees higher than you, it could also alert you and say, "the mempool is growing, your transaction as been delay X hrs..." or maybe it could be a wallet and lets you pay a higher fee if you are in a hurry or something

Most of the 7 billion are living on ~ a dollar or so a day. With the roadmap and fee structure laid out by the core dev team, it would appear the the 7 billion are "priced out"/cant afford to use btc
