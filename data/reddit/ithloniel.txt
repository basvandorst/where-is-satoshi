Manulife doesn't offer crypto investment recommendations.  If you walk in thinking you want to learn about Bitcoin, you'll either walk out disappointed, or convinced Bitcoin is stupid gambling compared to the "investment opportunities" companies like Manulife can offer you.  That will change in time, but for now, this is our reality.

You are entitled to your opinion.  Personally, I think "which is the original vision" is the wrong question.  2nd layer abilities were built into Bitcoin from the start, intentionally, as was the ability to increase blocksize.  Nakamoto consensus on the chain accepted segwit, leading the project toward LN.  BCH forked, but only after consensus of blocksize increases were largely ignored.  Some think it was too soon to add a micropayments layer and more time was needed with blocksize increases.  Others believe blocksize increases are secondary to adding the new layer.  This is not as binary an issue as many make it out to be.  The chain that wins will have better scalability and/or security and/or network effect.  Atm, BTC has network effect, which is why it has a larger base supporting it, and a headstart.  As for security and scalability, I've heard arguments for both, and while I have my own assumptions, only time will tell.  Also, Ver and Jihan are pretty scummy, regardless of how one feels about BCH.  BCH would do well to distance itself from those two.  People flock to authority figures, like the mythical pseudonym Satoshi, and those two are a PR nightmare for BCH.

Thanks for this.  I deleted everything in this original post, and my comments, mostly because I felt it wasn't going to go anywhere, but that was before I read your comment here.
So why wouldn't transac fees be a concern?  Wouldn't we want Roger to be able to use BTC to purchase said coffee without worrying about the extra fee?  Isn't that primary to adoption?  I agree that decentralization and censorship resistance are serious concerns, but wouldn't this still negatively affect adoption?  Thanks again for taking the time to write the above.
EDIT: From what I understand, scaling blocksize without second layer still runs into the fee problem, actually.  I guess if it is a problem anyway, that supports 2nd layer arguments.  The fee still concerns me, as far as adoption is concerned.  Would PoS resolve this?  Can BTC even go PoS or is it pointless to even consider that?

Or they keep buying the dip, avoiding the crash in the first place, because they're expecting a major recovery.  Honestly, I think this is more likely.  I do think bitcoin will suffer a strong crash, but calling it a "popping of the bubble" would be inaccurate.  Expectations for the market's future performance will likely soften the blow.

This really cleared things up for me.  Doesn't that make Bitcoin Cash's claim kind of erroneous?  BCH wants the name bitcoin, but if they want to function as cash for the blockchain, they can do that separately.  I guess they are trying to take the name, due to the weight it holds?

I agree, but I don't really view it as a problem.  I think btc still removes some of the major threats of centralization in our economy, and while others remain, while there are still issues, it is an improvement.  Furthermore, a decentralized  autonomous organization (DAO) may be capable of doing what more centralized organizations like banks have done in the past.

People use credit/debit due to its greater convenience over physical money.  BTC needs to emulate, and surpass, that convenience, regardless of consumer protections.  Whether this is achieved through a card of its own that is globally functional, or through mobile NFC, or a RFID pin that taps for payments, BTC and other cryptos need to become as, if not more, user friendly than the opposition on a global scale to see strong adoption.
@_date: 2018-03-13 06:13:35
I somewhat disagree.  I think there is value in a third party creditor providing consumer protection, but btc isn't competing with that system directly; however, it does force change in it.  Btc is competing with cash.  If you bought new bedsheets for $70 cash from Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond, what method of recourse do you have if the product was somehow damaged or flawed?  The reason you bought there rather than a tiny no-name store was that you likely knew their returns policy was good.  Similarly, online distributors, like Amazon, can offer consumer protections.  This is not to say a 3rd party cannot develop, offering consumer protection for your purchases with crypto.

Get a Ledger Nano or a Trezor.  They are name brand hardware wallets that will only cost you around 80 to 100 bucks, and it will provide you secure storage.  Remember: your private key is not your public key.  Keep the private key secret.  Public keys are just cryptographic references to your private key, so the public key is safe to share.  Also, make sure you don't buy a hardware wallet with pregenerated seed words; that is a telltale sign of a scam.  You want to generate the seed words yourself once you have the wallet.

This is an argument I frequently hear, and I can never agree with.  The problem with the banking system is not simply that it is third party, but rather that they control the supply.  The Fed Reserve is headed by the banks, and gov. lobbying lets them dictate subsidies based on every dollar printed, forcing inflation for others while cushioning themselves.  Btc can't be force printed, or counterfeited.  It is an immutable global distributed currency, regardless of any organization that hodls large quantities.  Also, tech like this allows highly decentralized companies to potentially develop to compete with the privately built centralized companies of the past and present.  This goes for exchanges (eg. Dex) and eventually banks.

It was a security issue, as Bitcoin's original design included the possibility for contracts with mempool replacement.  This feature was disabled in 2010 and later removed, due to being a potential security risk.  It was always intended to be the next stage.  Here's a fun old lecture that explains it a bit more, with Mike Hearn:  .  He also explains the idea that eventually became the inspiration for LN; micropayment channels.
In case you don't have time to watch the vid, here's the most important quote from it:
* *"The design supports a tremendous variety of possible transaction types that I designed years ago.  Escrow transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multiparty signature, etc..  If Bitcoin catches on in a big way, these are things we'll want to explore in the future, but they all had to be designed at the beginning to make sure they would be possible later."* - Satoshi Nakamoto
Note that Satoshi doesn't use the term "smart contracts", but perfectly describes them, claims he designed them years ago, and had included code in Bitcoin for their potential implementation.  The avoidance of the term "smart contract" seems purposeful, considering the term was coined by Nick Szabo, who was almost never mentioned by Satoshi, although they were both colleagues of Finney, and interacted with Cypherpunks frequently.  It seems highly unlikely he was unaware of Szabo, while being colleagues with all the same people, and integrating &amp; discussing concepts identical to smart contracts (and bitgold).
Further reading:
* [Transaction replacement]( also known as mempool replacement.

This.  The volatility is less about the number of people holding now, and more about transaction volume.  BTC is now the 8th largest currency in the world, but is barely used to transact for goods and services, largely due to fear of volatility and the scaling problems that are only now getting resolved (Lightning Network is growing).  As trust in BTC &amp; crypto increases, as oracles and merchant platforms are built, we will see more acceptance of crypto for transaction purposes.  As a result, the volatility will stabilize, and BTC will become the first widely adopted global decentralized currency, to be followed by other future cryptos.

The hypothetical predecessor to bitcoin, bitgold, as named by Szabo, seems oddly relevant in the comparisons of bitcoin to gold today.  Szabo seems to put a lot of importance on how gold functioned as a currency, and it seems this was important to Nakamoto as well, given his chosen "birthday": April 5th, the date the US confiscated gold from its citizens (in 1933), and 1975, the year that law was rescinded, allowing people to own gold.  Given Szabo's penchant for articles layered with currency-focused history on unenumerated, this seems like something he'd choose for a pseudonym's fake birthday.  It is also worth noting "Satoshi Nakamoto" is not simply an alias or pseudonym, but a "nym".
Nick developed an idea based on masking true identities online with something called "nyms".  These later became a commonplace reality, online (anonymous), but the concept seems to piggyback on bitcoin with the Satoshi alias, and private/public keys.  Like having a nym with economic identifiers.  It seems unlikely to me that the same man who proposed nyms, smart contracts, and bitgold is not Nakamoto. 
Also, there's the Hal Finney connection.  Hal was mentioned several times in the BitGold paper, due to his work on DPOW, with Szabo mentioning how this is the technical basis for bitgold.  If Szabo were to start making bitcoin, it would follow he'd reach out to, and wish to work closely with, Hal Finney... recently I heard someone mention they saw Hal respond to that very post for "help building the predecessor to bitcoin" that Szabo made.  I think it may have been an invention of their mind (memories get like that), but if others can confirm this, that'd be pretty hefty evidence... Szabo and Hal start working together 3ish years before Bitcoin's debut.

Prediction: BTC will outpace them so far in tech, BCH will feel pressure to upgrade in a serious way; this will lead to a horrible security flaw, and BCH will experience double spending first-hand.
