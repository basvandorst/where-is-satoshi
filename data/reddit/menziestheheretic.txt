So if a Russian individual does something, it has to be considered 'bad' and 'dangerous'?
I think you found refuge in the false consensus propogated by media manipulation just right.
**edit:** I actually think you're a paid shill. So many upvotes and only 2 replies... sad times indeed.

What does this mean? [image](
There are lots of sellers selling at one particular price, and lots of buyers buying at one particular price. And the only way to be able to buy at any other price is by buying and selling untill those bars are gone?

I can’t generalize? Why not? Because it’s an accurate generalization? Or because you think every exception should be mentioned?
You explained your equality of outcome pretty well.
@_date: 2018-05-20 10:35:30
In the contrary, you posed as an example of my generalization. Equity is an abomination.
Everyone had the exact same opportunities to go to college. That is, everyone pays the exact same college fees. That is far different from letting to poor go to college on the cost of society, which is equality of outcome, and could be applied to every aspect of life. Which is basically socialism, which may sound good, and looks nice, but actually doesn’t work in reality.
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:45:27
Equality of outcome, a true abomination. Group identity, taken care of by the government. Taking down the richest, so they can pay for your abortions and free Obamaphones.
The right believes in equality of opportunity. Inherent rights of the individual, not provided for by the state. Capitalism. Small government.

No I wasn’t. Saying that something is at least not as bad as something worse is not actually defending it.

They aren’t students, they are people hired by CNN, or in some cases actual CNN reporters.

So you’d rather have a reputable news source like CNN tell you what happened during a shooting?
Perhaps google what the pictures are about, to prevent yourself from hurting your reputation from now onwards.
CNN interviews “students” that are actually their own staff. Let that sink in real deep.
