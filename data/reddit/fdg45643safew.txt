If you want WU, maybe try  - you could also check localbitcoins.com in case there's someone selling in your area..

honestly it doesn't take much.. it's basically a branding/marketing exercise - lots of companies are setup with whitelabel websites so no real technical work is needed... however it's a crowded market space it's difficult to be competitive against the larger players (especially since you won't really be in control of your pricing).. bitcoin isn't a big enough advantage IMO. Some people might buy it for the novelty, but then you'd probably have like 100 customers who bought it for fun but never make any phonecalls and eventually you'd get bored and shut the whole thing down.

Well I'd be happy to pay your phone bill for a 10% markup in BTC.. I don't really see what's in it for you though.. and I can't imagine this service being popular with the public.

The cheapest way is going to be a GBP international wire transfer to mtgox - mtgox can receive GBP so you don't end up paying bank fx rates which are around 3% for retail bank accounts. mtgox now require verification so you will need to upload a passport scan and utility bill to get started on that. Another thing to be aware of is that although mtgox can receive GBP your bank and the banks they deal with may not be entirely clued up on that fact and may attempt to convert the funds into USD or JPY and they will charge you for this.. it probably makes sense to send a test transfer of a smaller amount first in order to make sure this isn't happening first.
A quicker and slightly more expensive way is bitstamp.net - you make a SEPA transfer to their slovenian bank account. This costs around £5 at most major uk banks, however you will also pay your bank's gbp to eur fx rates which could lose you around 3%. This will still generally work out cheaper for smaller amounts because the £5 sepa fee is much less than possibly the £50 wire transfer fee. Also bitstamp does not require any verification, you can pretty much just create an account and immediately go to your online banking and do the sepa transfer so you'll end up with bitcoins a lot sooner.
