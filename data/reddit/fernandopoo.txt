I had a very similar experience where after a week, they got back to me saying they would solve my issue and then...nothing, no response at all to multiple follow up emails over the course of months.
I mean, I get it that they are overwhelmed by new signups and support requests. But that's an even better reason to have some sort of orderly, systematic process for handling this stuff. I have no idea what their system is now, but from the outside it looks completely random. It's completely unclear to me what it's going to take to get them to even give me an update at this point.

Aren't there other examples of cryptocurrencies that are created out of thin air though? In what way would the price of Bitcoin be impacted differently by exchange with a dollar-backed currency vs. a currency that is entirely based on social consensus?
Just as a thought experiment, assume Tether was completely transparent about operating on a fractional reserve model and people accepted it anyway and traded it for Bitcoin. Would the price of Bitcoin be lower in such a scenario and if so why?
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:59:24
Can you explain how Tether is artificially inflating the price? Let's say I exchange some Ethereum for Tether and then use it to buy Bitcoin. I don't see the problem there, I have simply exchanged one digital currency for another one.
Now maybe there are issues around how much Bitfinex keeps in the bank. And that if literally everyone tried to cash their Tether in at once, they wouldn't be able to. But that's a different issue from saying that the recent growth of the market is fake or artificial (which is what Bitfinex'd and people like Nouriel Roubini appears to be claiming).
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:34:00
OK but again, how does Tether equate to fake demand? When someone buys Tether, presumably they have to pay the equivalent of one dollar USD in the form of other digital currency.

This is sort of a myth. The polling average before the election was a three point lead for Clinton. The actual result was a two point lead for Clinton.
What people in the mainstream media failed to imagine was that Trump could win blue states, and win an electoral college victory while losing the popular vote. 
People went on to interpret this as "the polls were completely wrong" but the national numbers themselves were actually surprisingly accurate for a country of 350 million people.
Trump himself recently tweeted out a poll that put his approval at 45%, with over 50% disapproving. That's far more favorable than other polls which generally put him in the high 30s -- but still lower than what he got elected with. 
So...is Trump himself wrong? And what do you think his approval actually is?

Elections told us he won by a minority of votes and his popularity has fallen since then. 
I'm sure there are shills on both sides but not everything is a conspiracy. Lots of Americans like Trump, a larger number dislike him.

Yeah that's why you take an average which is what I posted above. Trump's average is currently 38% positive, 56% negative. 
Now maybe that is off by a few points in one direction or another. But off by 13 points (what he would need for a majority)? Unlikely.

Yes the media falsely created an impression that a Clinton victory was inevitable when the actual polls were much closer. You can blame the media for that, but I'm not sure the rational response is "we can never trust polls again" when they were literally just one point off.

I agree with him more often than not when it comes to liberty and individual rights, but I wonder if his arguments are really all that well thought out. For instance in the video above he talks about how governments adopted greater regulation in the years following the Great Depression and how, in his view, this didn't solve anything, therefore regulation of monetary systems in general is always negative and that Bitcoin shouldn't be regulated.
In this case I happen to agree that there is no reason to regulate Bitcoin. But Ron Paul didn't arrive at that conclusion through a careful analysis of what Bitcoin is and how it works. He used an ideological argument that says don't regulate because regulation is always bad. Essentially using Bitcoin as a way of easing into a familiar rant against government that of course people who like Ron Paul are going to applaud. When it comes to people making policy, I'd prefer someone who thinks through the nuances and looks at problems empirically rather than adhering to an ideology that tells them what to do in every given situation. Unfortunately that's what most politicians do and it's more like a religion than a science.

Put the grammar and attempts at analyzing his writing aside. There is no reason to think he is in any way involved in Bitcoin. The only connection is the name (which is a common Japanese name) and the fact that he worked in a vaguely similar field.

Just because Newsweek erroneously zeroed in on this guy doesn't mean there is a very convincing case that he is the real SN.

I can imagine pretty easily how a monopoly can arise with no government interference. Take Google as a recent example. I'm not aware of any heavy-handed government regulation on search engines, but Google has nonetheless grown to completely dominate the market in many parts of the world (if not technically a monopoly it's pretty close with 70% of the market, especially since it's easy to picture a scenario where Microsoft never bothered to pour millions into their own search engine to try and compete). 
And the reason is simply that they got into the game early and leveraged their success to get so far ahead technologically that competing with them becomes extremely difficult. Yes, technically speaking anyone can start a search engine tomorrow, but good luck ever catching up with Google in terms of technology and  infrastructure.
In fact, the internet, which is far less regulated than other sectors of the economy, is full of monopolies or near monopolies.
@_date: 2014-06-07 03:44:42


Actually it's almost 70% [as of this spring]( and that's basically the same as the past couple years. Remove Bing as a competitor (propped up by Microsoft's influence and millions in investment) and they have almost complete dominance.

How does net neutrality possibly result in censorship? All it consists of is the principle that companies are not allowed to charge more for certain kinds of traffic, which leads to anti-competitive behavior. 
So this is a restriction on ISPs (i.e., you can't speed up your own video service while slowing down Netflix) rather than the government taking any kind of action to interfere with the internet themselves. If they ever did take some action to censor the web or reduce internet freedom, it would have nothing to do with net neutrality and shouldn't be considered part of it.

That's an interesting point, but I don't think the answer to this is as simple as you are making it sound. What would happen if we did away with patents and copyright completely? I think the advantage would simply shift to another terrain - in this case, ownership of infrastructure. 
After all it's not as if Google's algorithm is the only basis of their success. There are other decent search engines like Bing and Duck Duck Go out there that rival Google purely on the basis of the search functionality itself. But the fact that Google has hundreds of data centers around the world and are able to index a much larger portion of the web than their rivals makes them the authoritative option in search. 
So in the end we get back to the issue of private property, whether real or virtual. You raise the question of whether Google would have had success in the first place without being able to patent their invention. Maybe not, but in that case wouldn't their algorithm simply have been co-opted by an existing company with access to already-built infrastructure? In this way, destroying patents and copyrights doesn't necessarily kill off monopolies, but could even strengthen them in many cases by handing the ability to dominant players to crush upstart competitors more easily.

Everything is a voluntary choice on some level. But if that choice is severely limited due to a lack of good choices, it doesn't necessarily amount to a clear vote for approval for something. 
So going back to the example of search, Google is the only search engine that offers the caliber of search that a lot of people require. They have advanced so far in this area that it's hard to imagine anyone catching up anytime soon. 
At the same time, Google does a lot of things I don't really like. There's the intrusive gathering of information for the government, constantly forcing login to Google Plus, etc. But because I run a business and I need reliable search results, realistically Google is the only viable option at this point. So is this a "good" monopoly? No, I would argue it's not good, it simply reflects Google's technological dominance in the field, but is far from the best of all possible worlds.

There's not much room for misinterpretation considering that he flat out denies it on video, and doesn't even seem to know what Bitcoin is. Either he is lying (and is a very good actor) or we have to accept what he says.


What I would say is that there should be a very high standard of proof for running a front page story like this. Millions of people will now see the issue and walk away thinking this guy invented Bitcoin when it's rather doubtful that he did.

There are real conspiracies, and healthy fear and skepticism of the government, and then there is type paranoia. There is zero evidence that the infiltration of online sites Greenwald reported on has anything to do with attempting to control public opinion on obscure (to the average person) issues like Bitcoin. 
Can you imagine the scale of resources the government would need to devote to remotely make an impact doing that? You would need to employ thousands of people on a daily basis, and the incentive for one of them to spill the beans on the whole thing would be high.
I'll also note that every group out there - from Bitcoin enthusiasts to conservatives to socialists - think THEY are the ones who are being targeted because the government is on to what they doing and working to actively disrupt them. This is giving the government, which couldn't even accurately predict the fall of the Soviet Union, way too much credit.

The entire "proof" is the acknowledgement Nakamoto supposedly provides. But the reporter's version of events is so strange - the cop knows who Satoshi is? Nakamoto admits to being the Bitcoin founder after calling the cops? - that you have to question whether it really happened that way.

Doesn't moralism ultimately have its limits as a way of looking at the world though? For instance, according to communists, capitalism is always bad because it exploits workers. There is plenty of evidence that a market system results in more overall good for workers in spite of some degree of exploitation, but communists reject this because they object to it on principle.
Similarly, I wonder if (some) libertarians are failing to see the forest for the trees because of their focus on the NAP. Yes there is an element of coercion involved in government. But ultimately the role of government is to act as a giant pooled risk management tool. Mitigating risk and enabling stability is what allows you to have actual freedom. I think you can make an argument that in a society where it is truly voluntary and the poor are excluded, you end up actually being less free and more oppressed because of the overall deterioration in living conditions and resulting social conflict.
TLDR: Just because something violates an abstract principle doesn't mean the overall outcome is not better than the alternative.

I know it's far-fetched, but just theoretically...if it turned out Karpeles was actually Satoshi, how would this affect the Bitcoin community/future of Bitcoin?

The furious downvoting of anyone who raises a question is a little over the top IMHO.

Well of course :) But that just goes to show that oppressive organizations can exploit people without necessarily being challenged or overthrown.

I don't know if you can draw too many conclusions from the lack of pictures and other personal info (although I noticed that [someone does claim to have a picture of him]( If someone isn't into social networking and cares about protecting their privacy, what would you expect to find? 
Maybe some blog posts, some random info here and there from school or work, a couple entries on "find this person" websites that may or may not be them? There's probably more on Szabo than there is on many people out there who no one cares about finding.

That was simply the writer's speculation.

Pump and dump aimed at one of the biggest audiences on the internet as well as the most gullible. 
Jones' viewers have got to be a dream for advertisers -- he can go to them and say look at what these guys believe, you can literally sell them anything.

"Anarcho" simply means "without rulers."
Anarcho-capitalism = an ungoverned system of capitalism. What other term would you use to describe it?
@_date: 2016-05-04 15:50:10
I don't necessarily disagree with that but by the same token leverage and power is going to exist in an anarcho-socialist society as well. You could imagine a society like that actually being kind of oppressive with all that pressure to constantly participate in your local community, resolve disputes democratically, never aggress on anyone, etc.

If a government collapses leaving people free from laws and socialism, wouldn't you be expecting prosperity and free trade to emerge under your theory?

Not everyone has the opportunity to peacefully earn trillions of dollars. There are always going to be haves and have nots. And when people feel they have something to gain by using violence, some people will take that route. Historically, it has been one of the fastest and easiest routes to wealth and power. 
As far as reputation and liabilities goes, ask ISIS about that. None of the incentives you mentioned have stopped them, or other militias around the world, from violently taking over land and slaughtering their rivals.

What's to stop a sociopath with enough money and resources from starting their own army?

I thought there were chat logs rather than journal entries. Are you saying he falsified all of that with the intention of later writing a book about how he murdered five people? Doesn't really add up.
I agree that the murders probably never actually happened. Seems more likely that he was being scammed by the person he was communicating with.

So you are acknowledging the fact that there are violent people in the world who might not swayed by the chance to peacefully trade with their neighbors? Maybe years down the line they need to rule the territory they conquered and so they set up a "government", but that doesn't disprove their existence in the first place. 


I don't think it's accurate to say that ISIS was entirely created by external funding. It was a reaction of Sunnis who felt persecuted by the Shia regimes in Iraq and Syria, taking advantage of the power vacuum in those countries to set up their own society. 
For the record, I'm not saying that in the absence of government you always get ISIS. Just that power is a real thing in the world, and when you have a power vacuum someone will inevitably step into that vacuum.

Look at actual lawless regions of the world, whether it's modern day Syria and Iraq, parts of Africa, or the favelas of Brazil. What emerges there is not peaceful anarcho-capitalism, but gangs and violent militias. When people are desperate enough and feel they have something to gain, they will take up arms and commit violent acts. 
It may be hard for those of us in the first world to relate to, but that just shows how far removed we are from how most people lived throughout history.

It's true, in a world where everyone is a trained medic, policeman and soldier, you might be able to avoid having those institutions. The question is whether most people want to live in a society where they have to do all of that, or whether they would rather just live their lives. 
A lot of the reason we have society in the first place is because humans figured out there was a huge amount of value in pooling resources and delegating certain tasks, instead of everyone walking around defending themselves all the time.

One of the great ironies in all this...he was an idealistic libertarian and Silk Road was an experiment in constructing a marketplace free of coercion and government. A couple years in, Ulbricht was giving people death sentences in order to keep his business running.

As far as the stuff about ISIS goes, I think we are getting into "no true Scotsman" territory here. In a world filled with governments, how do you ever prove that government wasn't the thing that caused the problem with ungoverned areas? But we can look back through history and see that humans were violent and fought over territory long before anything like the modern nation-state emerged.
So domination and coercion by other humans is a real problem that has to be dealt with, and can't simply be wished away. Paradoxically, modern government could be seen as a way of containing power. Limited, representative government could be considered the "least bad option" vs. a completely lawless system which would result in direct domination by whoever is the most powerful, who then goes on to impose a tyranny. 
Maybe an anarchistic, completely decentralized system can provide the same defense against tyranny. All I'm saying is that it hasn't been demonstrated yet. The world is a complex place, and well-intentioned ideas that sound good on paper often have unexpected and even contradictory effects when actually implemented. I get suspicious when I see people enthusiastically jumping on board and evangelizing an idea, without waiting to see if it actually works.

Graphic designer here. IMO, a logo doesn't need to convey everything about a company or product, which would be impossible after all. You have to take the context into account. People will read or hear about Bitcoin and learn what it is without needing it illustrated for them in such a literal way.
Also, you need to consider different uses of the logo. Sometimes it might appear scaled down on a webpage or elsewhere, and the Matrix zeroes and ones don't read very well in that context. Same with trying to print something like this, reproduce it on a T shirt, etc...you run into difficulties with such a complex design. So while your illustration looks nice, a simple coin is probably better for a logo.
