Don't do that.

What a shitty company PayPal turned out to be. Back in the day I loved PayPal. Now they pull shit like this all the time and I won't use them anymore.

Any idea if this could drive value up? Prices have been so low lately, now might be a good time to buy.

Banks are not allowed to know what is in safe deposit boxes. I work for a large bank. Only the safe deposit box specialists that are called to drill out troublesome locks or abandoned boxes get a peek inside sometimes. Under normal circumstances bank employees can't know, which is partially why they leave you alone in the vault.

That's pretty lame. I will not be using or recommending your service now or in the future. I am currently trying to make a purchase but it will just have to time out because you don't support my wallet.

I lost twice in a row and don't plan on playing again.

You might be right, I'm still learning about how this all works. It's fascinating.

A good thing about this is that idea is that it would allow completely anonymous payments. There would be no record outside the porn account.

Same. I am young and never had a credit card (although I have a bank account and debit card). Do you think this will work if I do not have a credit history?

Parents have a tendency to do that. I used to want to share everything with my mom, but stuff like this would happen. She either doesn't understand what I'm talking about (like at all) or she completely overlooks the point and finds something to criticize or prod at, even if it's a simple pun. Simple things I did to try to help her would just get her upset and anytime she was wrong about something, no matter how polite I was in correcting her, she would still get mad at me. I got to the point where I just kept to myself and moved out right after high school. 
As far as Bitcoins go, I don't tell many people about it, mainly because they don't care. I've heard it called an "imaginary currency" that "might as well be monopoly money." For a while I kept a few close friends updated on the price constantly because the higher it got the more money I was making - it was exciting. But even they don't really see the potential. One friend bought like $20 worth and barely broke even after the crash; he has no intent to buy more. I am the only one that I know who has taken advantage of and made money on this "imaginary" currency. 
Basically, just ignore your parents and don't let them tell you what to do as long as you make smart investments. If you are making money there is nobody that should stop you.

I've been really happy with Coinbase other than the speed. However a large part of the delay when you buy or sell is the bank transfer. There does need to be a faster way though.

I did not think of this. I guess it's technically not his obligation (unless they ask for rent/whatever) but if they see he can make $100 with a few clicks and waiting a week they might not be too happy.

So you can use Coinbase directly with SatoshiDice? I've been curious about playing the Dice but have all my BTC in Coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:40:47
Why are they rejecting? Coinbase is sooo nice! The other day I couldn't buy because they had sold their daily limit. I just kept trying often and eventually got it after several hours. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:28:51
I didn't sell because I don't currently have much invested, 1 BTC total. I did the math from all the little purchases and if I sold now I would lose like $40, which isn't much. I would rather just hang on and enjoy the ride. If it gets low and doesn't look like it will recover anytime soon I will gamble it away on Satoshi Dice to at least get some fun out of it. If BTC never takes off I can at least say I was a part of history. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:44:37
I just bought 1 BTC the other day and its already increased $15 in value. Pretty cool!
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:36:31
Well I thought $20 was high, I was waiting for it to drop to buy. Then $30 passed, then $45. Finally got it at like $50 and it is not even that low now.

Nobody realized this was posted by Cameron himself!

I had this idea at one point but no way to make it happen.

We really shouldn't care if we ever want it to be a usable system. Think about it, the value of the USD changes all the time as well (not as much obviously), but nobody thinks about that. A dollar is worth a dollar to most of society. You need to be able to think in bitcoins and not have to convert them to dollars first. 
But yeah, watching the price is fun. I made my first purchase when they were in the $20s
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:47:55
Wow! Can't wait to try this.
@_date: 2013-07-12 00:55:15
I just tried to verify my identity to get level 2 access and it told me that it could not verify me. All the info is correct...
Anybody else have this problem?

I rarely downvote and I downvoted that one just because of the political crap. I didn't want to, but it served no purpose other than making those opposed to Obama opposed to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:09:08
The problem is that all my friends on facebook think I am crazy for owning Bitcoins. I even got them at $75!
@_date: 2013-07-12 00:47:31
I'm so glad I have stuck with Coinbase from the start. It's been hard waiting at times, but they are such a great company. I'm going to go buy some right now!
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:43:15
I had this problem the other day and just had to keep trying until it went through. This was overnight, but mid morning the next day I got it. You just have to be ready to buy when the 24 hour limit resets or they will sell out again. 
This is a good thing! They are literally selling out of bitcoins, making the value increase.
