Usually the store owner gets a part of the fee for allowing the company to stick their machine there. So from a 20% fee, 5% goes to the store owner 15% to the machine owner.  Or if the ATM owner has to pay rent on the location like at a mall then the % fee covers that rent.  It's not like bitcoin atm owners are making a million dollars a year off a machine, most are like this dude, got charged $4, 100 more of those and he can pay the monthly rent for his machine, most are owned by individuals like some of ya'll in here.  Bitcoin ATM's get significantly less traffic than a regular ATM, the guy probably makes shit on a dollar basis, if it's too crazy for ya just buy on coinbase and support evil companies rather than your own community.  No, I don't own an ATM but it was a thought once back in the day.

Great you found out about Bitcoin and now you're here to fix everything that's wrong.  Cool story bro, first time I've heard it. /s  In the beginning memes kept Bitcoin going.  Not everyone is a Programming nerd, some people appreciate bitcoin on a deeper level that can only be expressed through meme so go lick Roger Ver's taint you loser.

I started buying bitcoin in 2011 with $2500 and in 2017 it was worth a fuckload.

dude, you can't use an image of a paperwallet as your main example then.  Paper Bitcoins on CME is NOT Bitcoin, it's fiat.  What does it matter if they play with monopoly money that says "bitcoin" on it?  You quote people with literally less than 100 followers on twitter and think they actually know what the fuck they are talking about?
@_date: 2018-11-05 15:57:48
Yo like I said, many people that are conservative left reddit already due to bans and because this site is toxic to them.  Who cares if it's hateful, what's the point of a safespace if you can't say what you want.  There's subreddits that are fucking disgusting as fuck on reddit and I used to go to r/greatawakening and NEVER saw anything toxic there.  I hear the left talking about violence towards conservatives but nothing the left does gets them banned, they don't get banned because their friend mods let it slide because of shared values.  But anyone who would have complained about it is already long gone and banned.  
@_date: 2018-11-01 12:12:06
This is the problem with crypto, y'all will follow anyone who says bitcoin even if they are fucking shit people.  Jack allows for censorship on his own platform for anyone who disagrees with his viewpoints and you think he gives an actual fuck about the future of decentralized things?

Actually, I was a life long Democrat.  You assume shit like you know me but you don't.  GAB was fucked by more than just their host, paypal fucked them too but I'm sure all these tech Billionaires don't sit around and talk strategy against the evil online nazis in their free time.  Safe spaces like all the ones that get deleted by reddit mods like r/greatawakening?  Subreddit being deleted is not Safe, it's literally the antithesis of "Safe Space", it's vulnerable to anyone with the power to censor (and there's a fuck ton of y'all here in reddit). The reason Reddit is far left leaning is because all the mods are left leaning and LOVE to ban any right leaning person.  There's no discussion now because all the even slightly conservative have already been Banned in all major subreddits even non-political ones.  The left has literally taken in authoritative positions and use their judgement and power to censor anyone who has even a smidgen of difference in values.  Literally the only subreddits I feel free at reddit are r/Bitcoin and r/T_D and the mods don't have the balls to delete r/T_D and the Mods of r/Bitcoin are actually fucking awesome.
@_date: 2018-11-05 16:05:55
You use arguments like this and it's fucking dumb.  There's rules and tools here that say it's a SITE WIDE BAN if you try to bypass a subreddit ban by making a new account.  Are you a noob or just purposely saying false shit?  It is enforced but ONLY ON CONSERVATIVES!!!!  YOU FUCKING CANT SEE IT CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO FUCKING SEE IT.

There's no proof cause the people who were fucked can't speak up in places where you hang out and you don't listen or take them seriously in the places where they do complain.  And you're right, freedom of expression does go Both ways, it's you who can't see my point though, not the other way around.  It's you who have the blinders on.  There's an expression, walk a mile in someone else's shoes.  If you walked a mile in conservatives shoes, you would actually see this grand conspiracy taking place.  
@_date: 2018-11-05 15:28:06
Yes you can have those things, it was like that for MANY Years.  Only recently has censoring become a big thing where social media have thought they could use it as a tool.  Freedom of expression used to be a thing until it hurt your feeling too much.

Uh yeah I do, I've been banned in many subreddits for nothing more than a difference in opinion leaning to the right.  I know many people who have been, I got banned in r/nike for saying I don't support kaepernick.   And why are you sitting around in subreddits that you hate?  Just so you can find something to fuck them over with?  Just because you think something is hateful doesn't mean that it is.  YOU are not as important as you think you are.  I can find a thousand tweets where people are calling out for VIOLENCE towards conservatives REAL VIOLENCE and you think calling someone a name which does literally nothing but hurt your feelings is somehow more fucked up?

Nah, probably at that point I would say fuck it and go all fuck you pay me mode cause that would be the end of the last stronghold.  If bitcoin goes down then decentralization was just a pipe dream and at that point it's time to make way for the new centralized crypto party. I've already lost faith in humanity at this point so it wouldn't surprise me if it happened, although it would be a very sad day in crypto..but not the death.

Don't fucking think just because this account is new that I haven't been around.

I HATE assholes like you that think you need to police the internet, get over yourself.   It's assholes like you that are censoring this whole site cause you have some fetish need to control peoples speech.  If you had the power, I bet 1000% you would abuse that power and censor.
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:22:48
you should totally buy a bitcoin atm and charge less if you feel it's a rip off.  But the fact is, you'll just complain about it and that's the end of it.  Most of these machines are owned by just regular people and small mom and pop operations and for the amount of business they actually get 15% is not crazy.  Sure if you're just looking for the lowest fees, just go with the big boys like coinbase.  But there's people who are willing to pay the fees to help move the industry.  It's the same as the people who say you need to spend your bitcoin, well buying bitcoin with a 15% fee is also the same as spending it since you're paying a 50-100% markup on the product anyways, why not just pay a 15% markup and hold bitcoins, most of you are holding bags of -85% anyways so who really gives a real F about 15%.
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:51:41

You can also do it on localbitcoins but the disadvantage is time.  Middle men are not necessarily a bad thing, these atms are around 24/7 and can give you what you need in a convenient known location in relative safety.  Do you pay a company  to make you your coffee even though you can make one yourself?  How's that not also a middle man but you just don't think about it that way.  You pay for the convenience of not having to make that coffee yourself and also you pay a company for the convenience of getting your bitcoins quickly without having to worry about getting ripped off by some random dude you met on the internet and his $5 wrench hack.  Middle men are only bad when they FORCE you to use their system, just having a fee to use the ATM is not the same as credit card companies trying to get rid of cash.

There's a big difference between Can't and Won't.  You can do lots of stuff with Bitcoin and you can spend it on whatever you want but most choose not to.  Gold on the other hand is basically useless, you really cannot buy anything with gold on a daily basis.  They will come, a very important 90 year cycle is about to be over.
