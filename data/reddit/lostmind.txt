Thank you. I appreciate your reply. If I'm not paying through an online wallet.. how do I allocate the fee?

I'm not fully verified yet, so I don't have the ability to transfer instantly, but I bought coins yesterday and it let me cancel one of my transactions. 
Are you fully verified and it has been 30 days? Not sure about lack of cancelation option.

I know it has been asked before, but I'd like to ask it my own way:
1) I don't need to worry about miner's fees if I'm moving a little BTC every now and then, right? When should I be concerned about miner's fees, what is acceptable % per transaction? How does one pay a miner's fee (let's say I'm sending from a coinbase account. Is there a field for this?)
2) If I have a computer disconnected from the internet and store my info on it, is that cold storage? The wallet.dat file is a combination of my public and private keys that I set a password to? Is the wallet.dat file the ONLY thing I need to care about as far as "losing" coins? (other than the password I create and carry in my brain).
Sorry for the basic questions, but that's what this thread is for, right?

All good questions, but you have not done nearly enough research to invest 20k. 
good luck with the research.

Like I said, they were all good questions. I think it is great you've been able to be a part of bitcoin to that extent. 
The way you framed the questions seemed to me like you were starting from scratch, not that you were merely exploring other approaches from a blank slate.
If you have to ask questions like that, you aren't ready to invest that much imho.

gotcha. thank you. Assuming app versions for in-store transactions have something similar. 
Thanks!
