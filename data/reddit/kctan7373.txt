there is no point doing mining these days, just reg an account in any of the exchanges and start doing trading will be likely to be more profitable than become a miner. The solo miner era has long gone......

BitStamp, CoinBase..etc. If u possess certain amount of Bitcoin, u better get yourself a hardware wallet, such as Ledger, Trezor ..etc

not everyone out there are interested in owning bitcoin, they like shit coins , so u will have more bitcoins to share 
@_date: 2019-03-30 07:23:06
people are saying how extraordinary to own a full bitcoin, or there are only a few percent of people on earth that could own fractional of bitcoin...well, maybe the truth is that people out there are not interested at all to own bitcoin, they prefer alt coins, shit coins that will make them rich in sort period of time...
@_date: 2019-02-23 06:46:25
are they trading bitcoins, or just some logo sticking on the glass window?

Trezor is open source ....but Ledger is not ....so ..... yes ,u r right , we might one day wake up with empty wallet.. I strongly recommend using brain wallet.

@_date: 2019-05-19 04:33:53
well on the other hand this is not quite a good news  - reason being if the number of coins left is around 17M, that means the fraction of bitcoin is also getting less and getting harder to own even a Sat, ppl would look for alternatives
