Limited understanding indeed. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:01:17
Thanks guys. So the Amex option is a no go eh? 
Second question: say I purchase my BTC at Gemini, will they then give me the option to transfer the coins to a different wallet (using its address) without hold ups and difficulties? 
Third question: how long is the verification process with them? Time is an issue here for me

Exactly. You guys seem to think these huge spikes in BTC encourage institutional investors to show interest. It does NOT. As any junior options trader learn on his first day on the job, volatility is a statistical measurement with no direction, and huge spikes increase the standard deviation even though they are “good volatility” - there is no “good volatility”, it’s volatility nonetheless, and institutional investors like mutual funds, banks and insurance funds won’t touch it, nor are they allowed to by law even if they wanted. No institution would put such volatility on its balance sheet, period. 
Today I met a BTC ideologist who claimed passionately that sooner or later some central bank will declare BTC as the country’s reserve currency. I looked at him and laughed. 
You guys are dreaming. 
This forum seems to be mostly about the petty ego wars agains bitcoin cash, instead of discussing the true value of BTC as a value-storage vehicle. This is sad, like a bunch of kinds playing gangs. This type of atmosphere is partly what’s keeping this asset class from becoming something more. 
I’m prepared to get downvoted, I don’t care - downvoting me simply proves the point that instead of an educated discussion, this forum is merely an echo chamber, not to say a circle jerk.

Yup. Thanks for saving me the time to post that Guy’s adorable bubble. One thing though - Wall St. would come near  BC at its current state. I’m not talking about the occasional millionaire saying “eh what the heck, put a mil or two on this thing, see what happens”. That’s not Wall St.  pension funds, mutual funds, money managers and investment banks - they will not, and cannot, put this type of volatility shitstorm on their balance sheet. Nope. Never.

This sort of comments, and attitude in general, is exactly what’s wrong with this community. It’s one thing to believe in a certain idea, or vision, and then there’s just being blind to reality. This is not a good investor’ mentality, hysterical, zealot-like enthusiasm is the mirror image of hysterical fear.

I laughed

Binance is my solution as well. Got fully verified within 24 hours (to increase withdraw limit) and I withdraw from them with ease. Why won’t you be withdrawing? Of course, they don’t do any fiat, so eventually in order to realise my profits in dollars I’ll have to convert my alts into BTC, and withdraw the lot in BTC to some BTC/USD exchange

For the uninitiated, could you please define “win”, in your view?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:01:29
Correct. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:44:01
I agree. Bull trap
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:24:33
Same story for me with GDAX, Gemini and CB. Verification pending for over a month now
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:43:14
Lol. When people on r/bitcoin prefer PayPal... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:09:19
10-20%? Update your numbers. People who bought in three days ago at the highs are now down nearly 40%. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:10:07
Shhhh don’t tell people what they don’t wanna hear man. Just post memes, trash on BCH and end every message with HODL and you’ll be gilded 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:49:57
So for how long will morons here start cheering “the dip is over!!! To the moon!!!” Every time the bloody thing botched up $500? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:43:53
The the type hedge funds you are referring to are the last thing you as a bitcoiner want in your market.

If these are the “communities” the bitcoin community is associated with, I don’t want any part of it and it deserves to fail. What the hell is he on about anyway
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:25:10
Why not both? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:02:12
Uhmmm try 40%. And counting.
