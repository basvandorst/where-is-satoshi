Uh, why?  You (and I) WISH we had a spare 40 BTC to buy a Lambo with (insert “duh” here).

The owner is a friend of mine. And yes, he’s very aware of stray rocks that strike the vehicle if he hears them when he’s driving (wouldn’t you be???) 
I’m sure the insurance is very expensive, as are most things in his life.  But he lives the life of a rich dude, he isn’t a guy like you or me that made some money and put it all in a super-car.  The car is just one small part of his life, just as your car is to you.  You know how your car is kinda shitty compared to how nice your house/apartment is? It’s the same thing with him, except he drives that Lambo, so do the math on his house.  
Don’t hate, it is what it is.  
By the way, ground clearance isn’t an issue for owners of supercars like this.  When he rolls up to his house he hits a button that elevates the car’s suspension so it won’t scrub the ground/pavement as he pulls into his garage. ��

This is my friend's Lambo.  Trust me, at the time he paid for it, 40 BTC was reasonable.  He did not spend all of his BTC on the car. Just the opposite, it was simply a portion for him. He was one of the fortunate ones. 
Last week when he was driving me around, every time we pulled up to a stop light, I spotted every dude pulling out their phone to take a picture of us as we pulled away.  I don't blame them, I do the same thing if I happen to see them. I mean, they rock.
Here's a view from the inside:

The owner is a friend of mine, and trust me, he isn’t a guy who “only” had 40 BTC and spent it all on a car.  That would be silly. No, he was one of the early adopters that did very well. When he bought it, 40 BTC was just a small portion of the total amount of his BTC, the equivalent of the portion you or I might pay for a car, or perhaps a hot tub or nice swimming pool. To him, it wasn’t a big deal really (at the time).  And isn’t THAT big of a deal to him now.

Your link "get better friends" is in reference to him double parking.  But consider the circumstances.  Yes, he double-parked.  Yet I was with him when he did the exact same thing and even made a crack to him about being the asshole that double parks because his car is more precious than the others.  And if you'll notice, just like with this photo, he picks the most distant spot from the door, somewhere where double parking won't affect anyone.  It's always in the darkest, most lonely corner of the parking lot.  
If he pulled up in a normal spot up front and did this, I'd straight out tell him it was a dick move.  But since he chose the farthest spot from the door to hopefully avoid a ridiculously expensive repair (for what would be a super-simple non-expensive ding for you or me), he did what he did.  Get... the fuck... over it.  Walk in a rich dude's shoes for a year and see what you'd do.

No sir, neither of us are dirtbags... at least not in comparison to someone like you who would write such a comment without even reading my post.  He's actually a genuine guy who busted his ass his entire life until (and still to this day) he happened to profit from a wise investment in time and energy into cryptocurrencies. 
But, yeah, keep on hating.  See where that gets you.  I'm guessing, quite far (this is where I roll my eyes.)
