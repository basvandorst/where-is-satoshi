Nice of the governments and their men with guns and tanks to give Bitstamp permission to exist in Europe.

BTC price is up 100% in the last several months.  If anything it is being kept artificially high.

You could buy 20 Gox BTC with 1 regualr BTC on BitcoinBuilder right before the owner shut it down (after saying that he wouldn't and you could trade them indefinitely...instead he shut it down with less than 24 hrs notice).  
But yes most likely 20 Gox BTC for 1 BTC was a great deal...at least if we get more than 5% of our Gox holdings back.

They dumbed down software with very few options to customize.

OB will probably not be very successful, mainly because scammers will abuse the system and make it too risky for honest buyers and sellers.  
And it does seem to be 100% censorship resistant from what I understand.  Why do you think listings can be censored?
It isn't 100% anonymous, but you can still list anything you want on there and not risk it being removed.  You could risk yourself being removed into a prison cell, but that's a different issue.

I have some gold too.  I started buying in late 2013 and the chart looked ugly but I bought anyway.  It's starting to look better of course, but chart still doesn't look great and could be the big bubble has more time to deflate before it truly levels off and heads higher over time.
But difficult to store gold, compared to BTC of course.  BTC is a better store of value, imo, although the volatility isn't great.  But gold has been heading downwards steadily for years so not much better.

Sounds like he is saying that Bitcoins are a joke and that there really isn't a great alternative to gold, which is the go to safe haven (according to him).

Yeah kiddie porn and everything about it just makes people nuts. And combine that with the bomb parts and midwestern usa moms with 85 IQ will be scared about someone taking pics of their fat, fugly kid and then being the victim of a terrorist bombing at the local walmart.
They will be all for banning bitcoin and everything remotely related to it.   If you tell them banning the $100 bill will protect their kids too, then they will vote for it.

Very poor analogy.
But yes of course the majority of people want dumbed down interfaces. That was my point...that Apple figured this out and profited nicely from it.
@_date: 2016-02-16 22:58:30
No, apparently the claims totaled something crazy like 20 million bitcoin.  So for those who didn't bother to file, there are plenty of other scammers who put in bogus claims.  
I only claimed what gox.com showed was in my account.  I hope they don't accept claims that run contrary to that.
@_date: 2016-02-17 16:31:58
They really dumbed down computing in general as far as the user interface goes.  Good for half the population with sub 100 IQ, but not great for the other half.
@_date: 2016-02-06 09:01:39
That's excellent...you did an incredible job with it.  Hopefully this is shared and a lot of people see it.
(The only thing that I don't like in the original and yours is how Ben Franklin is one of the "Old Money" people.  He was a badass and probably would have loved Bitcoin.  But I get the point and just an aside).
How long did it take you to put that together..obviously very professional and just as good as the Paypal one, as far as production values and editing goes.
@_date: 2016-02-18 15:11:21
Notable how he frames his entire argument and equation in terms of "security"...what makes us more or less secure.
He never once mentions privacy and citizens' right to it.  Because to him, that is not part of the equation.
@_date: 2016-02-17 21:51:17
I am mainly talking about Iphone and apps and also software in gneral.  Not sure what Linux has to do with it...the avg person never uses Linux.
And not talking about the "interface"..talking about menu options that give you greater control over the program and more things you do with it..customization, etc.
@_date: 2016-02-06 16:41:01
especially when they are holding a pair of 4s.
@_date: 2016-02-24 15:37:55
Yes and it's only beginning. Wait until someone kidnaps a kid and does a "Lindbergh baby" type of deal....gets paid millions in BTC and then kills the kid.  If you don't think that will lead to crazy new virtual currency regulations, then you are delusional.  The public doesn't care and the banks and politicians do.  Writing is on the wall.

Btw, the Google Drive and DropBox links aren't working but the Tinypics one is.  I'll to upload it to youtube myself if i can and will link back here to give you credit.
@_date: 2016-02-08 22:39:46
Ok thanks for the info and I will check out your site and reviews for sure.
@_date: 2016-02-12 13:24:13
I've seen this before and yes, absolutely amazing.  Oligopolies always lead to consumers getting f**ked hard and especially true in this case.
@_date: 2016-02-17 21:51:35
Don't forget that the computer/phone must be in a pretty color with rounded edges.  That is the most important thing.
@_date: 2016-02-16 18:14:12
Yes of course they will try this.  They will try to confiscate everyone's $100 bills just like they did with everyone's gold in the early 1900s.  
They want you to only have electronic money in the bank, which of course means that you don't have any money at all and are totally at their mercy.  And of course they will charge you negative interest rates on that IOU that they are holding for you that they don't necessarily ever have to pay.
@_date: 2016-02-06 08:57:16
Sounds very complicated. That's why I sold my bitcoin for now and will buy back lower after the hard fork. Do you think the price is going to rocket upwards with all this going on?
@_date: 2016-02-09 01:16:48
That's just the kind of thing I'm looking for, but I want a site that's been around awhile and a good reputation so low probability I'll get Gox'd along the way. I'll check it out though.
@_date: 2016-02-11 09:01:56
That's great.  Just like Backpage.  Just brings more people to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-15 20:33:34
Yes 10 to 15% is what I'm thinking too.
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:50:29
They already have plenty of ammunition, but you are right that they will appreciate another more.  
Of course they will present OB as a way for people to buy and sell weapons, identity theft documents, and child pornography.  Even if that is .0000001% of whatever is sold on there, they will focus on that and of course the dumb mfers out there will believe all of it and be fine with Bitcoin being banned
@_date: 2016-02-15 20:33:01
Yes the US gov't stole that money from Gox and of course, by extension, stole that money from Gox account holders.
@_date: 2016-02-16 20:57:23
When I click on anything, I get:
 "Invalid Request
As a security precaution, you must manually navigate to all account pages."
Does anyone know why that happens and what it means and how I can get past it?
@_date: 2016-02-17 16:29:11
Yes same here and it's important to realize that Tim Cook is not Steve Jobs.  
And not saying Jobs would have complied with this, but Cook does seem to have some integrity in some important areas.  Maybe the fact that he is gay has caused him to be the victim of oppression in the past and he is more aware of it than some others.
Plus, it's safe to say he's a brilliant guy (high IQ) and has taken a logical approach to this, although does take courage to stand up to the FBI and US gov't for sure.  (!)
@_date: 2016-02-11 09:02:48
Good for them...just like Backpage (or rather what was done to them), they will only inspire more Bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:51:17
No openbazaar is not as anonymous as Silk Road and the like.  They designed it so it wouldn't be.
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:46:53
If you don't know what is attractive about it over ebay, then you are happy giving away 15% of your money to ebay/paypal when you sell something.  And nothing wrong with that at all, but many other people would rather keep that 15%.
