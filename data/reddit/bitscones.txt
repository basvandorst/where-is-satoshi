Bitcoin seems non-ideal for this use case since bitcoins cannot be easily traded for goods, services or local currency in most of the developing world.

"hackable private data" is a problem that plagues all systems including bitcoin. Way more people have had their bitcoin wallet stolen than have had their bank account hacked and drained of funds. The same problem would persist if people were responsible for securing their medical records.
This isn't to say that people don't *deserve* to control their own data, but the reality is that the average user has no idea how to correctly secure their data and decentralization is only going to cause them to get hacked *more* not less. IMO, this is a consequence you accept along with the freedom it affords.

Why does that have anything to do with bitcoin? Storing credit card information is not a requirement, most businesses avoid doing so specifically because of the security implications; bitcoin is no different, if you allow a company to store your private keys on their server, you're in exactly the same situation if a breach occurs, the only difference is that credit card users are not liable for fraudulent transactions whereas stolen bitcoins are unrecoverable. 
UPS doesn't need to store your credit card information any more than mt.gox needs to store your bitcoins, this is about a single company's poor security practices, it doesn't reflect on either payment system in any way.
@_date: 2014-09-18 23:01:29


I'm talking about storage *in memory*. You don't need to use a math library because an int64 perfectly models any possible balance of satoshis with perfect accuracy, there is no loss of precision to consider.


Ok... true, but irrelevant. The point that everyone is trying to make is that you can avoid the need for fuzzy floating point calculations altogether by simply using the most fundamental unit of value that you're attempting to model. As another poster noted, if bitcoins accrued interest this might be an issue, but they don't, so it's not.


That's a very strange and incorrect accusation. Anyway, *any* additional dependencies add complexity, period. Why add another lib to your dependency graph when you could just use a long integer.

This is pure incompetence from a security engineering perspective. Information security 101: *never* transmit sensitive information over the network unless **absolutely necessary**.
It's one thing to be lazy, but this:

Whenever services like these get compromised, we can always look back and see tell-tale signs that the company had poor security pracitces and was bound to get hacked, this is one of those signs; save yourself now.

A difference in theory, but in practice there is no difference since almost everyone volunteers and the result is many centralized databases full of personal information that exists *right now*.


Huh? People will always have the choice of whether or not they want to use an exchange, and for most bitcoin users this is already the reality, people aren't going to suddenly stop using exchanges just because it becomes mandatory to give information that they already have to provide 95% of the time in the current setup.

Frankly, blockchain.info created this mess and it's their prerogative to do due diligence in determining if claimants fall within the range of vulnerable addresses. If they *do* end up getting scammed out of a few coins in the process, I think they just have to eat that damage, because that's the cost of being irresponsible with other people's money. This type of ridiculous shit that makes bitcoin look like a joke. If money suddenly goes missing out of my fiat ban- I don't even have to finish that sentence because everyone knows what happens in that case.
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:17:15
It is risky to store your bitcoins with them because they're not at all competent with regard to security. You can see an example of this right now as administrators are asking users to provide their passwords over plaintext e-mail in order to restore funds that were lost due to blockchain's incompetence. A safer solution would be to provide an https encrypted web-form so that users can supply sensitive information, but they've instead chosen to request user information in the least secure manner possible (short of asking users to post their passwords publicly on reddit)

No, you're incorrect. Intrinsic value refers to value that is derived from properties inherent to an item. A common example is a loaf of bread which derives intrinsic value from the fact that bread can be eaten by anyone, regardless of any external factors such as anything related to the market. A huge surplus of bread does not diminish the inherent value in the capacity to consume bread for sustenance. 
Any value that shifts based on external factors is *not* intrinsic by definition.

Send successful bitcoin purchases to cold storage, send successful bitcoin sales to bank account, you don't *need* to store your private keys on a centralized server, but in practice *people do* for a variety of services, and when they do, just like with credit cards, they are put at risk. 
If coinbase were breached tomorrow it would be the exact same scenario, all the KYC info leaked, lots of wealth stolen and lots of people pissed about poor security practices, nothing changes because it was bitcoin.

Savings from fees are nice but marginal, especially for such a small fraction of incoming donations. Bitcoin is cool but just doesn't generate enough sustained activity to stay on the radar. Promoting bitcoin doesn't really benefit anyone except those invested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-26 22:47:26
bitcoin is only really useful for black market transactions. In that sense, it's quite excellent because the actual price of bitcoin doesn't matter since the goods are priced in real money and adjusted to match whatever the bitcoin rate is, that's why bitcoin was already being used back when the price was like $3 per coin. 
For the rest of the world, there really isn't any particular advantage to using bitcoin. The be your own bank crap is fraught with needless risk that 95% of consumers will deliberately eschew in favor of a bank that keeps their money more secure than they ever could.
Remittance as a use case is a joke. The price spreads and conversion costs are significant even if you're an affluent westerner, but poor people in poor regions  also have to deal with the reality of limited internet access, very limited computer literacy, and almost nothing in terms of a reliable way to spend or cash out their bitcoins. 
Bitcoin is here to stay, but it's about as useful as its ever going to be. 
@_date: 2014-09-05 20:24:10
That is not what the word intrinsic means. Intrinsic value does not vary based on factors that are external to the natural properties of the item, especially a factor like how many people use/own this type of item, that is pretty much the definition of extrinsic value.
@_date: 2014-12-16 00:09:17
That assumption is incorrect. It is not a waste of time, in fact, nothing short of tls encryption is acceptable for the transmission of user data over the internet. This is common sense security.

Bitcoin didn't prevent Karpeles from stealing millions of dollars. It makes no difference if it's a credit card number or a private key, both are just a string of numbers equally capable of being compromised on centralized server. If you decide to trust a company with the keys to your money, be it a CC or a PK, you do so at your own risk. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:37:45
This is bad advice. The e-mail response from support shows that they are incompetent from security perspective, you **cannot** trust that your information is secure. 2FA isn't magic, even google has had their 2FA services compromised through clever exploits, the key point however is that competent security professionals limit the damage that a hacker can do if a breach occurs, VoS is laying out your entire financial life on a silver platter for a would-be hacker. Nobody should use this service.

Isn't that obvious? The purpose of offering it at all is to allow bitcoin users the ability to donate with bitcoin; the location of the donation link doesn't matter for that function. If your goal is to  support Mozilla, then the bitcoin donation page satisfies that function perfectly.

My point is that if I wanted to send money (for example to my aunt in Senegal), it would make no sense to use bitcoin for this purpose since the only way she could use bitcoin would be if she arranged a meeting on localbitcoins which is not a trivial task for someone of her technical level not to mention scam prone.

Anybody who wants to donate with bitcoin has the option to do so, they just have to visit a different URL. They've optimized the UX on that donation page to match the needs of fiat users which represent nearly 100% of their incoming donations. 
For the tiny fraction of incoming donations that arrive as bitcoin, they have a special page to accommodate it. This seems pretty reasonable to me.
@_date: 2014-08-18 22:17:22
Yeah, that's true. I should have prefaced that with "since the inception of bitcoin" since the banking system had a big head start.
@_date: 2014-08-21 17:18:38


This is misleading. The default scenario is *not* to store credit cards, the exception to the rule is building PCI compliant infrastructure to legally store CC info. There is no vigilance required, it's much easier and cheaper *not* to store CC info.


They *could*, but they generally don't because the customer can easily perform a chargeback which is a serious headache for the merchant. There is just about zero incentive to be nefarious because you cannot get away with it, the customer gets their money back and the merchant becomes liable for the difference. The push scenario has its own merits, but those merits have nothing to do with this particular situation in which poorly secured data was compromised.
Poorly secured web-wallets are stolen all the time, the fundamental issue here is poor security, bitcoin doesn't provide a unique solution to this problem because if the company stores your private keys on their server (AKA a web-wallet) you're facing a nearly identical security scenario, regardless of payment method.

What are you saying? What claim have I made to you or yours? What exactly do you suppose I feel entitled to? Just to be clear, I'm not suggesting that you provide food to me or anyone, I'm explaining that claiming "a right to life" should override a woman's right to govern her own reproductive cycle in absolute terms, contradicts the idea that the right to property should override the need to redistribute wealth in order to guarantee that people can continue to live. 
My point is that **you conveniently invoke the right to life when it overrides the mother's rights but you dismiss the right to life when it overrides your own rights.** Hypocrisy. 


I hope you don't think I'm talking about you personally. What I'm saying is that if you don't support a government or societal apparatus that guarantees people can eat (which necessarily deprives you, me and the rest of society of some property), then no, you do not support a "right" to eat. 


Now we're on the same page. There is no "right to eat", just as there is no "right to life". Society and government define our "rights", and in this society we favor the rights of "self determining individuals" over the rights of zygotes.


Once again we agree. It seems like we would make great friends. When considering the scenario of an abortion, it's evident that a zygote has no power of self-determination; but the *woman* does, so it is not moral nor ethical to deny her that right in favor of the zygote. By definition, a zygote is **not** a parasite, but science and history has clearly demonstrated that pregnancy is actively hostile to the human body (not to mention extremely uncomfortable, painful, and expensive), thus the only ethical option is to permit the woman to make her own choice before giving any consideration to the potential future whims of human sex cells.

Well, you're just being willfully ignorant in that case. Anyone who's ever watched a zygote split into a mass of cells can clearly see the distinction between a human being and an embryo. You might as well be arguing that a seed is the same thing as a Redwood. It's clearly not.


That's easy for you to say when you can have as much sex as you want and never risk the possibility of becoming pregnant. Pregnancy is *extremely* physically and emotionally stressful and demanding; if you truly believe in individual freedom, you'd *never* insist that someone be forced to go through with such a process if they didn't want to. Further, most people with this mindset have no problem allowing the child to starve to death anyway if they regard the mother as a "welfare queen". Allowing abortions is clearly the route that affords the most freedom to the individual, including **you** the taxpayer who won't have to foot the bill for a child the mother cannot afford to feed.

Every sperm in your sack meets that criteria and the vast majority of them will die. 


What about when you have to foot the bill for its food and healthcare? Although you did not say so, I'll point out that "parasite" is a common term used by those on your side of the debate to describe poor minority families that subsist off of government entitlements.  I'd respect your argument more if you believed that the state should be required to provide food and healthcare for poor children until adulthood (unless circumstances change), but I'm assuming that you don't (as is the case for most people who oppose abortion rights). 
You can't have it both ways, if the kid deserves life then you should be willing to foot the bill to sustain that life, otherwise you should back off and allow the woman who actually will become legally responsible for this child to make the best decision for herself **and for you**.
@_date: 2015-04-20 23:29:39


You claim I'm building up a strawman but you conveniently weaseled your way into addressing said strawman without actually providing a rebuttal for the argument. I'm ever so slightly disappointed to see I was right about your hypocrisy though.


Your supposed "right to life" notion rings hollow in the face of your dismissal of the need for food and healthcare as "feeling entitlement to property". A right to life necessarily means a right to the minimum essentials required for living. If you don't support a right to eat, you don't support a right to life and thus you lose the moral authority to judge a woman who terminates her pregnancy by your supposed standard that the fetus deserves to live. 
I guess I shouldn't be surprised, it takes the same level of mental gymnastics to ignore the distinction between a human zygote and a human person as it does to claim that a zygote has a right to life but that the baby formed by said zygote doesn't have a right to eat.

Well, they wouldn't really have much of a choice would they? Of course, most people would bow down to a violent tyrant who demands to be worshiped lest you face his torturous wrath. Personally, I'd probably submit to a god in the face of torture, but in my heart I'd never forgive the fact that god created us, created evil, and decided to wager our souls with the devil to prove a point. Your supposed god deigned to build us such that  we are incapable of understanding why he decided that bone cancer in kids is a necessary part of the master plan for the universe, so I don't think he can really blame anyone for rejecting him based on the world he's given us to live in.

As you can see, almost every poll shows Clinton leading the GOP candidates by a wide margin, and even though I don't think Hillary Clinton will win the general election, if you think polls are worth a shit, it's pretty obvious that Rand Paul has absolutely no chance of being selected as the GOP candidate.

They're not *unjustified*, they're just wrong (in the assertion that a fetus is a person). The problem is that "person" doesn't have an exact definition, so it allows room for the disingenuous argument that a fetus is a person, when it's clearly *not* one based on 99% of the qualities that we attribute to person-hood. 
This doesn't address the argument that "life begins at conception", but there *is* a clear consensus among intellectually honest individuals that a fetus is *not* a person. Hell, the majority of people couldn't even tell a pig fetus from a human one prior to the first 12 weeks.

Minthos is correct. 
The value of -50 is consistent with all operations that were applied to the database,  we only say that -50 is an error because a negative balance violates the business rules of the application. To extend the example, some banks offer an automatic credit to transactions that overdraft the account balance, putting the balance into a negative value. Even though real banks don't use eventual consistency, the -50 value would be *correct* as far as the business logic is concerned in that case.
