They already accept btc for reddit gold.

Sorry. You are the only one.

It will either A) go up B) stay the same or C) go down. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 23:43:01
I would like it. No worries if anyone else really wants it though. :)

$18k! Too high for a good quality controlled machine. You can get a functional one for $100.
Oh wait, the functional one is $7k. Oops.
This is you right now.

If the battery life is longer than a couple weeks i don't think it would matter much either way. The reduced cost might be better than additional life. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:45:14
Yes because it doesn't feel like a cost or wasted time if you enjoy it.
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:09:02
Might as well throw synergy in there too.

That implies intelligence though.

If you're super paranoid, unplug the data connection to your hd too.

I'll agree with penguins, I think industry stopped trying to improve HDDs, so the price flatlined. SSDs are where the research has all been for the past 5 years. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 05:13:44
That is so.. not BTC friendly.

Start kind of hardware are you looking at to make it that expensive?

 I keep hearing bad things about mt. Gox. And recently only good about coinbase. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:49:10
Ive noticed they are higher on buy and sell both, so I wasn't worried about that.  I may gamble my coins a bit on justdice. Bittrivia is pretty fun too, when people are there.
@_date: 2013-10-18 17:30:21
I do consider this gambling as well. I just wanted some reason to start using bitcoins. I'm very interested, I just haven't needed them. I don't plan on trying to make a real income from it. 
So buy in coinbase, trade with mt. Gox or another and transfer back to coinbase to cash out?
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:44:30
Dude! So helpful! You answered every question I had. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 16:32:13
Is using Mt. Gox to trade and then sending those coins to Coinbase to cash out a good solution?
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:43:17
This is the only correct answer.
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:45:18
@_date: 2013-10-18 16:33:00
A few days to buy and sell each time?

Since you're meaning besides overheating, no. All it does it work your GPU, so besides the wear and tear, there is absolutely no way for it to damage it.
