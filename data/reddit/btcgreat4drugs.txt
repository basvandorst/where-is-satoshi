SO SHOULD I SELL MY 0.05 BITCOIN OR NOT
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:42:37
I now have all of the pieces to the  puzzle. Mt. Gox acted alone and in desperation. Comprehensive post after I lawyer up.
Edit: Due to some angry Gox depositors, I've been advised to disclose that Karpeles was overstating the fact that he had "lined up" investors. The truth is, in a move of desperation, Mark asked several investors for a bailout, all of which seemed to have immediately notified the authorities once they learned the extent of the fraud, negligence or incompetence at Mt. Gox.
That is to say, my leak did NOT cost depositors their investments. There was no chance of a bailout. Please direct your anger at Mt. Gox, and please do not blame me for your losses. Even if you disagree with my reporting, there was nothing to gain by continuing to cover this up, but much prolonged agony for Bitcoin and perhaps additional damage for new depositors.
Thank you for your support and understanding.
SELL SELL SELL !!

Yes, I like how Reddit always downvotes anything about governments and banks being anti-bitcoin! It is so nice to see this community hates the government and banks, and that everyone supports bitcoin, a currency which is mainly used to do things which are forbidden by the criminal government... It's also nice to see that the Bitcoin Foundation supports my/our opinion, as most of the platinum members were involved in laundering and other ''criminal'' activities according to the criminal government!
I hope they will never forbid bitcoin because if they do a lot of the illegal things you can do now with bitcoins, will be a lot harder! Now nobody notices because of the exchanges, hacks, etc. Hopefully the government will never consider banning this great currency! :)
