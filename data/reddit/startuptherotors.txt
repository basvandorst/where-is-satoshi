I'm sorry but I've had to report you to the police, what you're doing is EXTREMELY illegal and dangerous and I can't stand by and watch.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:34:26
Probably some idiotic US regulations.

That subreddit has become exactly what it used to mock. Now that's  what I call comedy gold.
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:22:40
I heard they're into big black blocks in that subreddit
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:47:21
Are you so scared of the 3 regular users that remain there?
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:11:10
Nice name, is that what daddy used to call you? Seems like he used a good name for you, considering your apparent inability to process basic logic behind statements.
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:52:05
I wasn't sure what language that last word was in, though.

u/spez confirming he's a disgusting cuck once again

expecting more from the chinese mining mafia? mistake!
@_date: 2017-04-27 23:57:45
People bought some bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-04-08 12:10:18
And why should we care about the opinion of these stupid people?
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:24:35
Feel free to elaborate on the mysteries of the free market that are apparently unknown to an uneducated pleb like me.
@_date: 2017-04-13 07:50:13
wtf are you even talking about?
@_date: 2017-04-13 15:15:42
I don't show a pizzeria my dissatisfaction with their service by making my own pizzas you fucking retard, I do it by going to a different one next time.
@_date: 2017-04-06 00:38:06
but only if you want fuck
@_date: 2017-04-28 11:10:17
And the most stupid one. Anyone falling for this shit in 2017 is an embarassment to humanity.
@_date: 2017-04-04 11:24:02
Buy high sell low, that's the way I do it too!
@_date: 2017-04-04 00:07:16
land of the free
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:03:13
like the guy above acting as if this debate in some mysterious ways stands in contradiction with the concept of "free market"?
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:40:17
I realise, but:
1. In our beautiful, democratic world so many ridiculous things are illegal, that the government should have no say in, that I'm happy if people have a way to launder their legitimately obtained money and not get fucked by idiotic laws.
2. "Money laundering" boogeyman has been used to severely limit our financial privacy and liberties, so I'm happy when these laws are made less effective.

But my hands are larger than yours. And they're not *literally shaking* since the last election.
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:04:58
Thanks! You've explained my point better than I could have.
@_date: 2017-04-12 08:02:59
What a god
@_date: 2017-04-09 17:57:02
Calm down, Jihan.
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:13:48
ooh, this is good stuff, thanks!
@_date: 2017-04-08 12:16:37
u/blockstreamcoin is not a satire account. He's an actual delusional idiot.

How can I 'communicate' with bitcoind when it's running? With a default node installed with apt-get there is the bitcoin-cli, but how do I do it in this case?
@_date: 2017-04-08 12:11:26
Good. Money laundering should not be a crime.
@_date: 2017-04-20 01:49:05
This man is a criminal who murdered plenty of people and almost destroyed America. Jail this fucker already.
@_date: 2017-04-20 01:51:19
yay mob rule! fuck all forms of democracy.
@_date: 2017-04-28 10:50:25
That's why many traders denominate in btc and that's the number they try to maximise, not the fiat value.
@_date: 2017-04-09 11:13:46
how do I signal for segwit UASF?
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:16:13
Their courts have already switched up whether bitcoin is money/property/whatever based on what suited them in the particular case. So apparently they can. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:15:07
This is probably Roger.
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:02:57
Bitcoin is whatever the state wants it to be, and they choose that based on how they can extort the most money from you in fines. Gotta get the money to bomb brown people from somewhere.
