My 2 (or 3) sats: 
1. "Unconfiscateable" only works if you can physically stay out of reach of the government. A lot of countries also have tax treaties and will cooperate in collecting tax for another country.
2. In criminal/civil law, the burden of proof might be on the party bringing the action, when it comes to taxes, they don't need to have conclusive evidence to make your life hell. Filing a fraudulent return can be punished with up to 3 years in prison, and up to $100k in fines, tax evasion is good for up to 5 and $100k (and you still have to pay the taxes too).
3. Information has a tendency to last a little bit longer these days (and I'm not just talking about the blockchain). Maybe you can get away with not paying taxes for a couple of years, but at some point they will have badgered, I mean REGULATED, the shit out of every exchange to the point where they'll just hand over all their files in a an easily searchable format. Going through 100k or 1M or 10M users doesn't really require that much manpower if you can just let an algo sort it out and flag discrepancies. The fact that they are prioritizing high profile cases now doesn't mean they won't come for the regular Joe later on.

Yeah... not entirely true. Trezor has a vulnerability that allows someone with physical access, the know-how, and some hardware to extract the private keys. This can be solved by adding a "25th word" (or passphrase). Having said that, I don't see physical access as the biggest threat.

Seriously, why are people putting down Bisq? For a lot (if not most) people trading p2p in your own circle isn't an option, and Bisq is still a lot better than the really centralized, KYC/AML compliant, custodial exchanges. Is p2p the best? Probably. Does that mean there aren't any other less bad options? No.

I disagree with you on the nodl being mostly marketing. It's not cheap, but it's a solid product.

In my case, I pay for the convenience (and the slick interface and cool box). Like I said in my other reply here, I have set up a node on a raspberry pi in the past, and it worked, but required quite some maintenance. For some people that is part of the fun, for me it got a bit annoying. I no longer have to keep an eye out for updates, and updating is just a click. I need a solution that works when I need it to, nodl gives me that. For me this makes it more fun/less stressy to play around with raspiblitz as a project/learning experience, because I know I can always rely on my nodl. I am just skilled enough to follow a tutorial and set it up, but I will always be uncertain if I haven't overlooked something, or made some stupid mistake. Not a feeling I enjoy when it comes to my btc.  
Anyway, I think every solution that lets people run a node is a good solution. What the best solution is for you, depends on your skills, budget, and time you are willing to spend on it.   
Just thought that it was a bit unfair to say the nodl is mostly marketing (I haven't seen much of that, besides a twitter account).
@_date: 2019-11-24 13:48:03
I hope this works, because I bought the Nano X because I got tired of deleting and adding the apps because of the limited space of the Nano S. Only to find I still have to delete and re-add all the apps whenever the bitcoin or ethereum apps need updating. That kind of defeats the purpose of the Nano X for me.
@_date: 2019-11-03 11:26:18
I can wholeheartedly recommend the nodl. I have set up my own node on a raspberry pi in the past and it works.... kinda. Every couple of weeks I had to do some troubleshooting, or resync, which got pretty annoying after a couple of times. The nodl is a lot beefier (it's a Pine RockPro64) than a raspberry (haven't tried the rpi4 yet, so that might make a difference). Some users have even setup a monero node alongside, and it still runs without a problem. Initial Blockchain Sync took just over 2 days (they don't come presynced, so you can be sure your device verified the whole blockchain). That would take a couple of weeks on the rpi3. The dev is solid, regular updates, configuration is dead simple (interface with tiles, only install and activate the components you want to use, with a single click), privacy is a top priority, full tor integration. Strong community, quick support. It has a sturdy metal case. I have the habit of rebooting after updates, but it will run for months without any trouble. It has an easy to use interface, but still allows you to tinker with it if you like (you can simply ssh in, I think it's headless Armbian/Ubuntu). For me, one of the killer features is that it comes with ElectrumX, an Electrum Personal Server. This means you can use Electrum, but instead of connecting to public servers, you connect to your own node, without leaking your addresses to external servers or the risk of connecting to a malicious server, or being left powerless when servers go down (which I have experienced with Ledger). Finally a way to use your hardware wallets with a feature-rich wallet (coin control, multisig etc.), without using third party servers.  
So, if you are adventurous and like to tinker and learn, go the raspibolt/blitz route, it's fun and rewarding. If you want something you can plug in and get started, I would definitely go for the nodl. If you are a bit more of a beginner, and also unsure about seed management, Casa might be a better option (I think you can just buy one and not use the subscription service, not quite sure), but I have no first hand experience with it, so maybe someone else can provide more reliable info on that.

It's a joke that started in the gun community:
 
*The boating accident meme is a joke  from the gun community, detailing how they would go about responding to  anyone seeking their firearms during a hypothetical confiscation.*
*The  joke began on /k/ as a response to numerous inquiries towards users  about what they would do during a hypothetical confiscation of private  firearms, caused by whatever reason. These questions where met with  responses similar to:*
*"Guns?  What guns, officer? I lost all my guns in a tragic boating accident"  with the implication that they would in fact never actually surrender  their firearms.*
As far as I know, Monero's fluffypony introduced it in the crypto community.

Congrats man! All the things I wanted to say (mainly concerns about your safety) have been brought up by others (but I would probably would have used a bit more friendly wording than some) so I am not going to repeat that. You also have been told about "not your keys, not your bitcoin" and your answers show that you are aware, and made a conscious decision about it. That is the only thing I really care about. I would probably made other decisions with regards to custody, but as long as you made an informed decision (and not out of ignorance), who I am to tell you it's wrong? So hey, I hope it all works out and you stay safe long enough to enjoy a really early retirement!

I do, and I use it to verify and broadcast my transactions using ElectrumX (an Electrum Personal Server implementation). I'm running a nodl ([nodl.it]( which I highly recommend. For me it's the perfect balance between convenience and customizability.

Equally or even more important, don't use Gmail for any bitcoin related business (like exchanges).

Both Trezor and Ledger support Bcash.
@_date: 2019-10-25 10:27:51
Just to be clear: I think there is no "one-size-fits-all" perfect solution for everybody, and it's definitely not my intention to lecture people on how they should handle their bitcoin. Also, I wasn't suggesting that you use the Ledger app for btc, I would stick to Electrum, but with a hardware wallet. The Ledger app would only be for bch. I might have misunderstood, I thought you said you already had a Ledger (but they aren't really that expensive anymore, both Ledger and Trezor offer their older models for €59).  
The added safety of using a hww in your setup would come from the fact that it provides the same security as a cold wallet, but in a lot more convenient way. Usually, convenience comes at a cost, but in this case, convenience can prevent what is called "procedural fatigue" (the more complex a procedure that you have to perform regularly is, the more likely you are to screw it up at some point). I don't know what you use as a cold wallet, and how often you move funds from there, but doing a cold wallet properly takes a lot more effort, and has more room for user error than a hww.
@_date: 2019-10-25 07:20:48
One thing I think should be mentioned too, is that claiming your fork coins can lead to privacy loss as it can help cluster your addresses. Probably not a big deal to most people, but it would be good to at least be aware of it. In general, consolidating coins is not a good idea, as it partly negates the idea of no address reuse. But if you carefully try to prevent address clustering on the BTC blockchain, but at the same time move the fork coins all in one tx, your addresses still can be linked to each other. Electrum and it's forks all allow you to send your inputs individually, without overlap. If you don't want to make it easy for chain analysis companies, you should first move the btc inputs one by one to new addresses in a new wallet (new seed), and after that move the fork inputs one by one to an exchange that allow you to create new deposit addresses, like Shapeshift, Changelly or SimpleSwap or something like that. The only regular exchange that I know of that allows generating new addresses for every transaction is Kraken.  
Again, for most people this will probably already seem like tinfoil hat territory, but I think it's important that people make a conscious decision about this.
@_date: 2019-10-25 09:29:10
I don't think that's how it works.
@_date: 2019-10-25 08:14:30
Electrum supports hardware wallets, so you could use the same setup with the added benefit of a hardware wallet I think (haven't tried it on an rpi) for btc. For bcash, you would probably have to use the wallet that the manufacturer provides. Ledger has a standalone desktop app now, also for linux.

Not just that, you also end up providing Google with a lot more detailed information: If you make a withdrawal, exchanges will usually send you an email, with details like amount and address. It's cool that you use a VPN, but if the exchanges keep sending you emails with "Login from new IP address" with the address, Google can tie that to you. And if they are subpoenaed by a government agency like the IRS, I don't think they are going to put up a fight. It may not be important now, but those records are for ever. If you use Gmail, have a look at [

I personally would like to see a full color emoji of the bitcoin logo added. It's great that the bitcoin sign has been added as a character, but as an emoji it would be a lot easier to use. There is a lot of difference between inserting a character with alt codes and picking an emoji. Also, emoji's aren't limited to mobile use. Windows has a built in emoji picker (WIN+.) and a lot of messengers like Whatsapp and Telegram also have versions for desktops which come with their own emoji pickers. You open the emoji picker and just start typing what you are looking for, and it instantly shows you the results that match the search. I just tried to insert the bitcoin character, and 15 minutes later, I still haven't succeeded. As an emoji, I could have done that in seconds.

Yeah, it's actually quite possible to get txs throug with 1-5 sat/byte, but 0... I haven't used breadwallet, but a lot of wallets allow you to set a custom fee, or at least offer you a wide range (more than just slow-normal-priority). But it's my observation that in general, wallets suggest a higher fee than necessary. I use [mempool.space]( for fee estimates. You can see the fee range of txs included in the  last blocks.

Fee is calculated in satoshis per Virtual Byte. I am not 100% sure why the "Virtual" was introduced, but I 'm guessing it has to do with segwit (segwit moved part of the data outside the block, maybe this compensates for that?). But anyway, you don't pay per amount, but per transaction size. Transaction size can vary, depending on how many inputs and outputs will be used. In general, when it's not too busy (for example in the weekends) 1-15 sat/vB will do if you are not in a hurry. 125 sat/vB should get your tx through pretty quickly. I usually try to send tx's in advance. If I know I want to trade on an exchange tomorrow, I try to send it the evening before, just before I go to bed (prevents me from checking every 5 minutes). If you are paying online most of the time you will get a rather limited window (usually something like 15 minutes) to make the transaction. Although most services just need to see that your transaction was broadcasted and don't necessarily require a confirmation within that time, I use a slightly higher fee. But that wasn't your question.... never mind :D
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:02:54
Yeah, thumbs down for bitcoin.com and bitpay. Wallets I like use: 
Desktop: Wasabi (works only with bech/native segwit addresses, has the option to use your own node for blockchain data). Electrum (feature rich, slightly less intuitive but worth it imo). 
Android: Samourai, Mycelium, BlueWallet (has a Lightning wallet built in).
And of course, for anything more than trivial amounts, please use a hardware wallet.

There were some security issues that have been patched, but the vulnerabilities are not really easy to exploit. So I think the risk of losing the btc is pretty small - but not zero. As others have mentioned as long as you have the mnemonic seed, you can always restore the wallet, but updating might get more complicated over time. There have been a number of cases were the device got stuck while updating the firmware. Most of these problems were solved in the end, but it took some time and sometimes even required the help of Ledger support. That's why I would update. If bitcoin goes crazy all of a sudden, you don't want to find out that your dad's device is one of those that gets stuck. Because if bitcoin goes crazy, every crypto currency related business will see an enormous influx of customers and support requests. I sent a support request to Ledger yesterday, and the autoreply said that it might take 5 days before they get around to it. You can imagine how long it would take if it's really really busy. You might be talking weeks here. The same goes for buying a new hardware wallet, or verification for higher withdrawal limits. Don't wait till the last moment, things can move really quick all of a sudden. Be prepared.
