Yep, I did a project where we were converting prop trade messages into swift like messages. Had to scan every trade against known members on the ofac list of i individuals to avoid. Now think of coming up with logic to scan for Barbara 1 vs Barbara1.2

It is becoming old, and it’s also becoming old when my associates in finance say “what are the fundamentals?” Bitch there is a fintech revolution going on

Economist are definitely a special breed. You bring up an interesting point when analyzing economic data do you form your hypothesis first or do the analysis and come up with hypothesis later?
