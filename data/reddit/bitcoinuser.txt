I am one of the damaged users and still waiting for my money from the Polish Bank Account. Since progress is so slow, and it involves a lot of money, I contacted a lawyer in Germany who will get involved in that whole mess. There is a lot of money at stake for everybody, and I think we should have much more updates on a frequent basis from the current lawyer/polish authorities.
To reduce the cost for the lawyer for each individual, it's possible to perform a class action, anyone who is interested, please write me an email to btc24.classaction and I inform you about further details.
