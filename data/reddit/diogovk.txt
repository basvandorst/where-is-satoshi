How exactly the price of any physical commodity (such as metals) can go to zero?

He said it can go to zero, not close to zero.

Are you telling me there are garbage men finding gold bars in the trash?
Ok let me rephase the question. How does the value of a pure gold bar goes to zero?

Gold please

I thought Bitcoin was "Digital Gold" and you're not supposed to make small purchases with it (such as a drink), at least until we have Lightning Network.
It this correct?

Seeing things like this makes me wonder if we're going to see suicides in the next big crash... People, please read about the dot-com bubble. 
Especially when talking short term (and 2 months is definitely short term), just because your investment went up doesn't mean you were right, and just because it went down it doesn't necessarily mean you were wrong.
I actually believe crypo currencies will completely change the world, but I'm starting to worry about a bubble.

Gold still better than fiat government currencies, though

The particular guy I saw, actually ended up taking the profit just a few months after he invested, so his story didn't have such a gloomy end.
That said, I'm pretty sure others didn't have the same fate, and those are not likely to come gloat in the forums.
