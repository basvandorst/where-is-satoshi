I've been out of the bitcoin loop for a while now (investing in other cryptos). Can someone explain to me why everyone hates BCH so much? Isn't it exactly like BTC but with a larger block size so that fees don't get so high?
Is it just that people are holding BTC and don't want to see it replaced? I mean if I had any BTC I'd probably sell it and buy BCH instead, but maybe that's just because I don't know enough about the situation.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:15:05
I know it sounds like I'm shilling for BCH over BTC, so I want to make it clear that I hold neither and don't have plans to. My point was that if BCH is BTC but slightly better, even if in just one respect, then I'd be more confident in its future. I've yet to hear a reasonable solution to BTC's problems, so I cannot reasonably expect one, can I?

I'm heavily into Ethereum *because* I know there are issues with BTC, but I didn't know the details.

It's really weird being subbed to both where the solution is "give everyone money" and this sub, where the solution is "make sure not to give everyone money."

Reasons why gold is a great store of value:
- Easy to identify  
- Difficult to counterfeit  
- Rare  
- Limited supply  
- Doesn't tarnish over time  
- Easy to transpor...
Oh wait I'm sorry these are all qualities of Bitcoin.

If the internet and electricity disappear on any sort of long-term basis you've got a lot more to worry about than how you're going to store your retirement money.
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:34:47
To whoever got it - congrats. I'm not gonna ask for a piece, but I would like to know what the solution was.
@_date: 2019-02-25 13:57:07
Too bad it's never working.
@_date: 2015-07-18 19:22:26
Sometimes I worry that when people Google 'bitcoin' they'll find things like this and dismiss it immediately.
@_date: 2015-07-20 07:10:20
I thought these were the rules that were *ending* today. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2019-04-19 04:34:06
There a lot of complaints right now about wealth inequality and people like to talk about crypto like it's going to save us. Isn't bitcoin wealth inequality a billion times worse?
@_date: 2015-07-13 07:35:49
Just stay calm. If you don't think the technology is a good idea, or if you're speculating with more than you can afford to lose, then you're in the wrong place.
EDIT: This dip that's happening right now is almost certainly temporary.  The only catalyst for it is that the Greeks reached an agreement? That's not a reason for a long-lasting price drop. Probably just weak hands leaving the market.  The real things to keep an eye on right now are China's stock market and the debt ceiling thing that is set to happen before the end of the year.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:23:50
Imagine if someday Bitcoin drops so low that it's a liability to hold it. You have to *pay* someone to take it from you.
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:40:29
I've been waiting almost a year for Top Secret. Maybe this is what's holding them up.
@_date: 2017-05-30 01:31:22
You're a little late to the table this time, but long term it will likely continue to increase.
You need to be okay with being in the red though, because that may happen before new highs. Same goes for Ethereum and other cryptos.
@_date: 2015-11-07 19:10:37
I'm fairly confident that the wealth distribution in bitcoin is already worse than it is in fiat.

Cashiers hate him!

You're mistaken. The Ethereum community is united, and the price is driven, by memes.
@_date: 2015-10-28 08:29:27
You're pitting my love of money against my love of adblock and it makes me uncomfortable. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:42:16
More people need to realize this.  The smart money is getting out right now.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:15:36
And this is the *exact* reason you don't see many businesses accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:37:05
Sure it can, but the fact that you can anonymously pay online is really the only upside that I see right now.  It's true that there will always be a black market, but consider the following:
If I'm a drug dealer, I'd rather not exchange my product for something whose value fluctuates so wildly.  Sure, I could win, but I could also lose.  I'd be much happier doing business in a stable currency, but I can't because of the paper trail.
This means that if I'm going to use bitcoin, I'd like my customers to convert $ to BTC, pay me, and then I'll convert it immediately back to $ so that I receive the same number of $ that they paid.  BTC, in this way, is effectively no more than a laundry - an anonymizer for illicit purchases.  Because of this, the exchange rate doesn't particularly matter.  The money will only be in BTC for a split second while the transaction is executed.  The fact that it's anonymous is all that matters.
So crash or not, bitcoin can survive as a black market currency.  What's going on right now is, in my opinion, little more than wild speculation over something that has no real value.  It's merely an anonymity provider.  Congratulations to the people making fortunes, but you're a fool to think it's not going to crash eventually.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:52:04
*Another* thing that could go wrong is if a capricious whale suddenly decides to offload his entire holding.  If one guy (or group, I suppose) has enough, he could trigger a panic.  The market would probably recover from this eventually though.
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:50:17
A rational person would say that it's like playing the lottery.  For a small fee you buy the chance to free yourself from ever working again.  But only fools invest *everything they have* in the lottery.  If you can't afford to throw the money in the trash, then you can't afford to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:38:29
I've been following this and you for a while - congratulations on your success so far!
I'd like to ask you a question though.  You invested $30,000 at ~$14/BTC.  Would you be confident in investing $30,000 right now at $140/BTC?  How much higher do you think it will go?  Do you ever plan to cash out?
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:10:53
This isn't a popular opinion, but I expect to see a crash.
Bitcoin is a lot like gasoline - it's very useful (it provides anonymity at negligible fees), just not as a currency.  Some people will trade gasoline for goods depending on their situation, but it doesn't really make sense to keep more than you need on hand, especially when you consider that a single accident can wipe out your entire inventory.
I'm really happy to see it gaining traction at a few retailers and the bitcoin bot is really giving it some serious exposure on Reddit, so the price might keep climbing for a while as the userbase grows.  You might be able to ride that wave and make a tidy profit, but expect a crash eventually.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:30:50
I don't know.  Maybe he knows something we don't.  Maybe he's sitting on 50,000 BTC and knows about some legislation that is going to be introduced tomorrow.  Even if the legislation turns out to be smoke and mirrors and is completely innocuous, bitcoin's value falls as a result.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:01:03
What I want to know is who's gambling with bitcoins?  That's like playing poker, but every time the turn comes around to you, you have to spin and pull the trigger as well as make your call.  Bitcoins are *already* a gamble.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:10:25
People who believe in Bitcoin's future:  If you had to argue *against* Bitcoin, what would you say?  What's wrong with Bitcoin?  Is it a problem that can be solved?
@_date: 2013-10-20 14:55:44
The Bitcoin protocol seems solid, so you don't have to worry about someone gaming the system.  If you're going to be skeptical, it should be because of this: currencies have value not because they're backed by anything but because they're widely used and trusted.  Bitcoin is not widely used at all (yet?) and many people don't trust it to retain its value, which is reasonable - it's highly volatile at the moment.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:07:29
Why would they crash the market rather than simply selling during the bubble and then buying back in afterwards?  The idea that they would devalue their own holdings doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:48:49
Another thing that could go wrong is if governments start to legislate against it.  The likelihood of this is a topic for a whole different discussion, but if it happens I think we'll see a severe loss of confidence in bitcoin's future.
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:34:45


Isn't it a concern that once all 21 million bitcoins are in existence, the number will gradually decrease as wallets are corrupted/forgotten/abandoned?  Won't this make them scarcer and scarcer, thereby increasing their value?  Deflationary currencies do not promote spending.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:53:21
I'd imagine they are.  Back when it was cents per bitcoin, people had to pay thousands of BTC for anything on there.  It wouldn't be hard at all to amass 69,000.  Now obviously not every seller held on to them like this guy did, but there are bound to be a few lucky people like him.  Maybe he sold on SR for a while then stopped and is only now revisiting his bitcoin cache since the price went up.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:48:37
I like you and what you're doing, but I'm going to tell you this anyway.
You're pushing into the realm of fanaticism.  You're putting all of your faith in an extremely volatile and unproven currency and making claims that it cannot fail.
I understand that you're still *way* up from your initial investment, but you need to take a step back and consider this realistically.  It's certainly possible that BTC is *not* the way of the future.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:46:06
Except they bought in last summer when it was $15/BTC.  They're still up.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:15:18
*Excellent* decision in my opinion.  I'm glad you finally decided to take the advice of just about everyone in here.  Your risk is now 0 and you stand only to gain from where you started.
EDIT (4/10 - 2:00 EST):  It looks like you might have picked a pretty good time to get your 30k back!  You should count yourself incredibly lucky.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:29:51
When the frenzy ends and the media stops celebrating it, then it will grow normally.  The value of $266 was entirely due to speculation.  It belongs around $30.
@_date: 2013-10-26 02:39:17
Typically seized assets relating to illegal goods are sold at auction to the highest bidder (with the proceeds often going back to fund the criminal justice system). It's somewhat ambiguous though - is BTC a currency or a sale-able asset?  My bet is that they're going to sell. The question is whether they're going to do it at a private auction like they usually do or if they're going to do it on an exchange. Either way, the price of Bitcoin will fluctuate wildly when it happens - first down, then who knows where.
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:22:27
Can anyone comment on Coinbase for someone who is interested in buying and (for the most part) holding?  Is there anything in particular that I need to watch out for with them?
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:36:07
Do people really think that it's a good idea to use something as volatile as Bitcoin as a currency?  Do people who support Bitcoin expect it to eventually become more stable (like fiat currencies)?
EDIT: *Ok, based on these answers people have been immediately cashing out BTC transactions in order to avoid problems with volatility.  If that's the case, then BTC is merely a vehicle for anonymity, and can't stand alone as a currency until it's more stable.  Fair enough.*
What's the best way to buy and sell Bitcoins without having to provide a huge amount of personal information?  Is MtGox really the best option right now?  I'm not a fan of their long waiting periods for transfers/withdrawals.
EDIT: *I've heard of localbitcoins.com and I've considered using it, but it feels like I'm putting a lot of faith in people who may very well be scammers, robbers, or murderers, especially if meeting in person.  Is that a concern?*
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:05:25
I don't think it will be as severe as that chart makes it seem.  I think it will be a gradual decline, much like the "crash" in 2011.  It's not going to happen overnight.  Once it bottoms out (in maybe 5-6 months) I think it will start to grow again - *that's* the time time buy.  Let it cool down.  Let the media stop talking about it so much.  The seed of doubt has been planted.  You don't just bounce back from that.
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:37:25
Why is that?  Have they had security issues or is transferring them just a precaution?
