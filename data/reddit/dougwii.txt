Got in back in September, as a broke college student.  I have invested 400$, and with everything going on in my life currently, I am going to have to withdraw soon.  Hopefully I have an opportunity to make more money with BTC in the future.

No.. I do the transactions with cash.
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:08:19
Used it before.

If you would have done this back in September, you'd have turned it into $25,000
It's worth the risk if you have more than just $10k, but dont invest all you have to spend.

I turned 400$ back in September into $1900 today.  I'm fucking ecstatic as a broke college student.  Still beating myself up cause early on i spent like $200 (which is now 600$).  Still have $1300 worth.

Exactly... lmfao
edit - ahh you have the 'redditor for 2 days tag.'  no wonder you're being a loser asshole on a crypotcurrency forum.  Probably in high school.

@_date: 2017-12-08 23:49:18
Same, got in in September at $~3700

Don't be the first one in, Don't be the latest one in.

I invested $400 at $4k, dumbly spent some while it was rising, but now have .07 worth $1000.
Just keep hodling.

I wish I was not a broke college student.  In September, I put in $400 and turned it into $1500 as of today.  But BOY if I had $1000, or $4000, I would have invested it.
Still happy with the gains

bought .1 at $4k.  Stupidly, in hindsight, spent 04 of it over time.
Still have .06, waiting for it to go back up to $20k then I have to sell for fines owed.

BOOYAH GIMME SOME BITCOIN
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:47:51
Currently 20. In college.  Not a single person I have ever met or know has $50k to invest.  Maybe one, and I don't even know him personally, just by word of mouth.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:14:53
any wallet?  
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:58:13
So this isnt talking about the physical devices you have to buy?  I can just move my BTC into the virtual blockchain wallet I have set up?
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:17:42
Wait, what? Im sorry, i know very little about BTC.  I have about .104BTC I got from gambling and withdrew $400 worth about a month ago.  I have this all sitting in an exchange, should I move it over to a wallet?  
None of this all makes much sense to me hahaha.  
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:47:17
precisely.  It's just about lived its life.
