Well, TIL! Thanks!

Heck, even Polish doesn't have one and it has the same alphabet as English. ^(though it did supposedly use the Korean writing system a long time ago...)

Internetting is hellish enough already with a 5 year old phone. Rotation would be the least of his concerns.
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:52:42
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:13:22
I don't think there even is a way to do that without a neutral third party.

Then arbitrage happens.

No, that's a vault full of wallets.

I can do it in the drop-down menu. I also have an app called Rotation Control that lets me use any screen orientation I want even if the app disagrees.

 open the above link.
This is a dude who buys Reddit accounts and has them spam links to his websites to rake in ad money. His site looks like a regular image host but you can't even post images on there.
If you pay attention to it, his comments are almost always unrelated to the comment chain and vaguely related to the OP. He just picks the comment chains with high potential of getting big to get more clicks.
Have a nice day!

The only other thing most people use P2SHs for is multisig, which doesn't really apply here since it's specifically *his* wallet.

There's a pretty high chance that it's too old to even support emojis. Some apps (such as Messenger) support them everywhere, but only because they replace them with images. You'll either need to get a new phone (I suggest the Xiaomi brand for a reasonable quality at low cost ^(not sponsored)) or hope that someone has figured out a way to update your current one.

For the same reason that the US can't get richer by declaring that every dollar is now worth a million dollars. The total value stays the same, so everyone will technically have more dollars, but they'll be worth less.

Transaction fees aren't wallet-dependent. You can set them to whatever you want, but it'll need to be higher than other people's if you want the miners to even consider your transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:13:48
If you're counting truthfulness by the amount of words, you could say it's 90% true because only the "Universal" part doesn't apply. Then again, that one word does make a big difference, so...

Not much, except that he said he likes it.

I messed around with faucets a few years ago, back when I thought they were worth it. Now I have a measurable amount of money in my wallet and it's pretty exciting.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:07:07
A rich weirdo, though.

New coins will be made regardless of where you're hodling the old ones. A fork is just a clone of the current blockchain, complete with all its transactions, but with new rules starting from the fork point.

Remember when 9000 used to be an impressive number? Yeah, me neither.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:50:54
Never too late.

Are you guys talking about Cory in the House?

Elon Musk, a really rich and really innovative and really cool guy who likes space, maybe a bit too much.

You might be on to something here.

It's a service to top up your pre-paid SIM card with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:51:49
Except it does it all the time instead of just downs.
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:25:29
My Reddit browsing app does that for me anyway, but you're welcome, I guess.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:20:11
What did the person say? The comment's deleted now.

Even though Coinbase can't see your keys, ever, thanks to the magic of client-side encryption.
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:33:24

@_date: 2017-09-06 20:58:24
Seriously though, how can Bitcoin become a widespread method of payment if everyone just hodls? Is there something I'm missing?
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:03:44
Can't you use bits instead?
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:41:18
Yes, and it's exactly what we're looking for. If you add the requirement for the hash to have enough leading zeros, that is.
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:56:36
It's actually checking if the hash is smaller than a specific value, which basically amounts to leading zeros but way more precise.
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:34:40
They can though.
@_date: 2018-03-27 08:26:07
That's not how Bitcoin fees work though. Bitcoin charges per byte, not per bitcoin. Sending $0.01 costs the same as sending $10000, as long as you received the $10000 in one piece and not in multiple transactions.

Time to make a plugin that changes "ld" to "dl".
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:38:41
This is the correct response.

Or both.

@_date: 2017-06-28 15:39:58
Probably the latter.
