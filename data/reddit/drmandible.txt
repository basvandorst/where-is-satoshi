I didn't mean that there are zero iPhone users interested in Bitcoin.  I mean that our collective effort is probably better spent in other areas.  For all the effort we spend trying to bypass Apple, we might get Bitcoin to a few people.  But I think that effort would be more effectively spent attracting other users.

Perhaps I don't understand what the investment is supposed to represent, but my understanding is that each share represents a fixed amount of mining output.  So I'm not owning a person, I'm owning a future interest in a portion of the profits of that mining output.  That is legally enforceable, regardless of whether there is a corporation.  I understand there are potential problems with finding the person to seek relief.  But I don't think the stocks were ever supposed to represent a share of owning a person, merely a share of the output in a mining rig.

Mutual funds are just one way to use a currency and conceivably bitcoin could have mutual funds.  And just look at the ridiculous amount of regulation imposed by the government in mutual funds.  This creates a barrier to entry for entrepreneurs to start mutual funds because if you violate anything in any of those books, you're basically done for and you'll lose your entire investment.  This is why private currencies (like bitcoin) have so much value - as long as the government doesn't manipulate them.

Bad form.  His question was a rhetorical device to try and point out that Dwolla has nothing to do with bitcoin's trustworthiness.  You asked if you can trust bitcoin and implied that somehow Dwolla would make bitcoin untrustworthy.  But that connection simply does not exist.  [edit] "They were/are a major player in the funding of this currency."  That is untrue.  Nobody funds bitcoin except through one mechanism - Bitcoin mining.  Dwolla is simply a currency exchange.
So he actually did answer your question.  Try and relax next time before lashing out at people.

If I invested money and made oodles from that investment, I'm a fool?  Can you explain that one step by step for me, please?  I only ask because I would typically classify that as a good move.
[edit] Lots of downvotes and insults.  Depressingly typical when people talk about Pirate.  It's like I've somehow offended simply by the way I've chosen to use my money.  I was under the impression that this was a much more live-and-let-live community.  I don't understand why some people take it on themselves to insult people who make different decisions, but it's very disheartening.  That's the kind of attitude that creates unnecessary conflict.  Thinking that one person's choices are worse than yours, and that such a person should be chastised for their choices, is *exactly* what created the state and fiat money.  Why do any of you care what I do with my money?  And how does putting some money in a risky investment make me so contemptible that you feel justified in publicly castigating me?

That's an interesting consideration.  It seems like a simple workaround (for smart phone users, at least) would be that a customer would enter a payment amount.  Then the phone app could generate a QR code which the merchant could scan (much like swiping a credit card).
With the newest version of Android, there are apps which transfer predetermined data when users bump their phones together.  That might even make the transaction faster.  I imagine a merchant device which is set up to constantly receive wireless data transfers.  Then customers could just enter a payment amount and touch their phone to the device, automatically transferring the data.  A screen on the merchant's device would then either read "Accepted payment of X amount" or "Error ______"

In that case, you might want to check out selling the food a la carte.  By that I mean, post what you're about to harvest on something like [BitMarket]( and see if anyone will buy it.  Admittedly, that's not exactly a reliable business model.  But it might make you a few bucks.

This scheme only works if the price fluctuates up and down.  My concern is that this new price would spike then gradually fall back to its previous point.

What you said is typically true of an economy.

I completely agree with that critique and I've been downvoting any calls to government action.  (You'll note my response in that thread you're referring to [here](  But not everybody there is talking about government fixes, which I agree are a hornet's nest of unproductive and unreliable results - at best.  Mostly they are still trying to articulate what a declaration of internet freedom should include.  Not sure if you're American, but I see a parallel between this and the Declaration of Independence.  It wasn't a call to government action.  It was just a list of what free people should expect.  It didn't all go down the drain until they sat down to draft the constitution.
@_date: 2012-07-12 19:59:51
Gigamining is worth about $373k, according to their listing on GLBSE.  It's true that they could run off, but then they would lose any chance at future business.  It seems like they have a strong incentive *not* to screw their investors, apart from any legal enforcement mechanism, because they're making more money with the current arrangement.
[edit below]
I was thinking about what you said, and I've come to the following tentative conclusion.  Whoever made the representations to GLBSE would be solely liable for any non-payment for the stocks bought through GLBSE.  The lack of a corporate form simply means that I couldn't go after the enterprise as a whole.  But a person who enters into that agreement would be legally bound to make good on their end of the bargain.

That looks like a list of things that free people should expect to me.  I never said they were anti-government, just that the Declaration did nothing to establish any form of government.  It's intent was to describe their theory of liberty.  Why is that so different from a Declaration of Internet Freedom - a document name which, I might add, is strikingly (and probably intentionally) similar to the Declaration of Independence.

All good advice here from others.  As for me, I used Dwolla/Mt.Gox.  And I'm very happy with the service.  Admittedly, it took a week to get my funds through Dwolla.  But, hey, nothing's perfect.  It's the cheapest option - by far.  Eventually some competition will come in and make them provide a faster service.  Personally, I used that week to study bitcoin and make sure I really knew what I was doing.  Made 5% on my first trade.  Been averaging about 3% per month since.  It's not a scam.
Lastly - do not use a shiesty website.  It's not worth the risk.  Use a trusted source, even if it means waiting a week.

Love the idea.  But I sort of wish the price wasn't pegged to the USD.  I mean, I get that Bitcoin prices fluctuate and it would make accounting and risk assessment difficult.  But there's an intellectual disconnect between writing a magazine that studies and advocates for Bitcoin adoption while simultaneously and ultimately preferring Dollars.

Well said.  I try to stay away from my lack of faith in fiat currency because I think it scares people away.  When people talk about credit cards being easier, I like to point out how credit card merchant fees create an artificial barrier to entry which crush small businesses.  I've personally known several business owners who have had very real financial problems because credit cards were taking such a high percentage of their sales.  My mechanic, for example, was paying as much as 10%!  That's pretty darn high compared to Bitcoin's 0%.

Ah, I see your point now.  Still the essence of OP's question remains, though.  Is Bitcoin fundamentally at odds with government?  For example, what if all people abandoned the fiat currency in favor of Bitcoin.  The government would no longer have a tax base since, according the the U.S. tax code, income is only taxable when it is realized in U.S. Dollars.  But if nobody ever converted their bitcoin back to dollars, there would be no taxable income.

There's a very real difference between explaining to others what you have deduced from the information available to you and your background/education versus labeling people as mentally challenged non-sapients who don't deserve the house they live in.
I don't understand the vitriol.  I **literally** think I would have been insulted less if I had just taken money out of the bank and lit it on fire.  
People around here talk a big talk about how Bitcoin is about a market free of government interference, but the first chance they get it's a damn witch hunt.  I'm only glad people on Reddit don't have the power to legislate "for my own good."

Admittedly, I'm not sure how enforcement would be handled for non-payment.  My first thought would just be that people would be unwilling to loan much of anything to someone who didn't have a really good rating.  Prosper.com was a mostly good concept, imo.  But they charged a transaction fee to pay for those collection agencies.  Because of that, they only allowed people to borrow a minimum of $1,000.  If a service dispensed with collection agencies altogether, relying instead on a rating system entirely, there would be less overhead.  In turn, that would allow the borrowing of smaller amounts of money and help trust-worthy people to build their rating up.
I'm just thinking off the top of my head here.  But I know there are lots of people who could really use credit at lower rates than they currently receive.  And I'd bet there are people willing to lend to those people at a lower rate than the existing creditors are willing to lend.

That's all I ask.  And I would add: I don't give a fuck what any of you think about it.  When people commented about Pirate being a thief, I didn't say anything because a) I don't know; and b) it's none of my damn business what one person thinks about someone who isn't me.  All I ask is that same basic level of decency, that when I post something about lending Pirate money, that people don't string me up for it.

"First instinct" is misleading.  OP said s/he already tried the website.  That was obviously the first and correct step.  I further assumed that OP had tried to contact TradeHill in some other way and that TradeHill didn't respond.  If OP had e-mailed TradeHill and they refused to respond, then what other option is there?  There are only two choices that OP has: 1) Ask TradeHill for the money back; or 2) Demand the money back in court.
Maybe I was wrong, but I assumed OP had already asked TradeHill for the money back.  This downvoting brigade and character assassination is completely fucking ridiculous.  I was just trying to help OP understand his/her options.

I'm not saying you don't raise valid concerns.  But I don't think they're insurmountable.  People are pretty creative.  :)
Off the top of my head answers?  A person with a 0 rating wouldn't be *ineligible* for a loan.  It would just be up to potential lenders to set a high interest rate.  And they probably wouldn't lend much.  eBay sellers took *years* to build up their credibility when eBay first started.  And I think it might be a similar process here.
Sure people might take a small loan at just run out on it.  But people did that on eBay when it first started too.  Recall that in the late 90's there was basically no way to enforce an eBay sale except through their internal rating system.  (That has since changed but the principle applies, I think.)  The people who are being loaned large amounts of money would have a reason to pay it back; they would want to borrow again in the future at low rates.  
If a person decides to pull a heist by building up good credit over years and years then running off with the money... well that would suck, hahaha.  But, if the money was sufficiently crowdsourced, it would likely only be a few dollars per person.  My hope is that *most* people borrowing at that high level would have an interest in borrowing more in the future.  And if most loans are repaid, then everyone is making some money and borrowers are getting cheap credit.
I know these aren't perfect answers lol.  But Bitcoin is new stuff.  We can't expect every new idea to have a perfect execution plan on Day 1.  That's why I came here.  :)

This is not a sharp decrease in demand.  The demand here is a demand to obtain more bitcoin, not a general want of bitcoin.  In other words, "demand" measures only the market capital available to purchase the good, not the entire population who seeks to own that good.  (See: Wikipedia *"[The term demand signifies the ability or the willingness to buy a particular commodity at a given point of time.](
Now if you reconsider the analysis with the proper understanding of demand, you will see that there is no sudden decrease in demand, only a gradual slowing of a growing demand.  In concrete terms, this means that as the price of bitcoin slows its increase over time, the velocity of deflation (and therefore expected short term returns) is decreased.  This will in turn slow the demand.  The pool of marginal buyers and sellers will become increasingly smaller as each successive price correction occurs.  This ever-slowing cycle will create a new, stable price equilibrium.  At a stable price, spending will resume.

The problem with the "just let them do whatever they want" argument is that you contradict yourself immediately upon starting that argument.

Rockefeller was at the head of a state sanctioned corporation with limited liability.  People were dieing working on his railroads but they couldn't bring him to court.  This is the effect of *state* policy, not freedom.  As I mentioned in my other comment, consider the works of Rothbard and Mises for a look at how the catastrophes can actually be prevented.  Governments only enable this predation.

Sure.  Barriers are always good for people already in the business.  Ask any doctor or lawyer.  The point is that it makes the market less capable of serving people's needs and will eventually calcify.

He's a self described free market anarchist, but he ditches the word capitalism because of the circles he's in.

I strongly disagree.  The contempt for saving began with Keynesian economics as a way to prop up fiat.  A strong currency recognizes that saving is merely deferred spending.  After all, I didn't buy my bitcoins and then immediately set fire to my computer.  The coins are still there, waiting to be spent.  And spent they will be, eventually.
Bitcoin is a hybrid currency and commodity.  The current spike in price is functionally identical to hyper-deflation which any economists (even Keynes) will tell you necessarily leads to increased savings.  You can't expect to berate people into changing their spending and savings habits.  When the price of bitcoin is more stable, spending will increase *dramatically*, I promise.
And, in case I wasn't clear, [here is a nice analysis]( of the "paradox of saving".
It concludes with:


Here we must substitute the phrase in the second sentence "supply of goods" for "purchase of bitcoins".  What trades do occur are magnified by the savings which causes the value of bitcoin to rise.  So, while it's true that there is less spending, that spending which does occur is magnificently beneficial to the producers.  I hope that made sense.

How do you account for predictions made by Austrian economists which were correct? 
I think most, if not all, Austrian economists would agree that economics is not a science. The difference is that the few testable theories which Keynesian economics has put forth have all been debunked, only to be revised as "neo-keynseian". In my studies of Keynesian economics I have noticed a disturbing trend of assumptions, confirmation bias, and jargonism. 
So I agree that Austrian economics isn't a science. But, unlike Keynesian, it doesn't pretend to be.

It's impossible to say with scientific certainty. The sudden increase could be artificial OR the previous price point may have been artificially low. 
As with any investment, we can only look at post rationalizations and future expectations to guide us. My expectation is that there are two interrelated causes for increased demand. The first is global financial uncertainty which breeds portfolio diversification, including btc. The second is the functionality of bitcoin in reducing transactional friction has expanded existing markets to include marginal producers.

It seems that most of your exposure to Austrian economics has not come from scholarly works, but from Internet users. There is a lot of utility in the works of hayek, rothbard, and Mises.

Lawyer here.
Yes, you can sue them but it will be extremely difficult to get your payment in bitcoin.  It's possible but impractical.  This isn't specifically a bitcoin problem.  You'd have the same problem if, for example, you paid someone for a car and they never delivered it.  If you sued, you would sue for the money, not the car itself.
As someone familiar with bitcoin, I recognize that bitcoin *is* money.  But that's going to be a complex story to tell a judge.  If you decide to sue, I would recommend filing for relief in USD.  It should be a matter of bringing in a printed screenshot of your order confirmation and proof that the order wasn't delivered.  Unfortunately that proof is likely a print out of the blockchain history of the specified address.  It could get complicated if the judge doesn't accept that as evidence.  I know of no jurisdiction which will allow you to bring up evidence from the internet while standing before a judge.  It all has to be printed on hard copy.
This is my long winded way of telling you to try exhausting all your options (repeatedly) before suing.  Depending on your jurisdiction, there will be a statute of limitations for how long you have to file a claim.  The lowest I've heard of is 1 year.  So you probably have a few months of berating them with emails until you start hitting deadlines.

So although the euro is being inflated, more solvent nations won't allow it to inflate enough to hide the problems in the least solvent countries.

The dotcom bubble was foolish investors putting money into things they didn't understand.  Honestly, that's probably what just happened here with bitcoin.  That said, bitcoin isn't comparable to just the bubble period of dotcom.  It's comparable to the Internet as a whole.  If we trend out the value of the Internet since 1995, I think we'll agree that the dotcom bubble was a forgettable speed bump.

But that's also the reason that Spain and California have cut back on service spending dramatically. They can't print money and the more solvent states/countries would be hurt by the levels of inflation necessary to maintain spending levels in CA/Spain.
I'm focusing on the impact of people in those insolvent places. Proportional to more solvent areas, they will experience higher taxes, reduced spending, and lower public employment opportunities / salaries.

When it happens, there won't be a warning. It was the same way in Argentina in the 90's and with basically every other currency collapses. The people running the show want to get their money out first. 
It's like this. Imagine you have all your money on btc and you knew for sure that bitcoin was going to collapse tomorrow. Doesn't matter why. Alien invasion or something. What would you do?

These are straw men.  In fact, they are worse than straw men because they are actually implicit in my argument.  I concede both of these points readily.  Bringing them up again as though they are arguments unto themselves is just plain wrong.  My rebuttal to these concerns has been explained: "The price will stabilize eventually. At that point, spending will increase." 
Eventually, of course, hoarding will stop because there will be substantially less wealth flowing into the bitcoin economy.  This will cause the price to stabilize and spending to resume.
There is no reason to believe that delayed spending will create a decrease in price.  A sudden decrease in the price of bitcoin will be the result of one of two things.  1) a sudden increase in supply; or 2) a sudden decrease in demand.  The first is entirely unpredictable since only those with large reserves of bitcoins know if or when they will cash out.  It is meaningless to try to divine their intentions.  The second is a non-scientific argument about maybes and hopes.  You claim that deferred spending will create a sudden decrease in demand, but how?  What is your evidence?  Specifically, I am referring to your statement:


How can you sustain this claim?  Why, for example, would a retailer continue to do business in bitcoin with the sole intention of eliminating their reserve of goods and closing their business?  It seems to me that as spending increases, we can expect retailers to buy in - not cash out.

Question is confused. Of course you can make money in bitcoin. You can make money in any currency (or commodity or service) if you do it right. 
If you're wondering if you can buy btc and just wait for the value to increase, consider this: Nobody knows. Everyone is making guesses, sometimes educated. As there is no practical way to short btc, most interested parties are longing or transactional. This means that most responses are going to encourage you that btc will increase in value, thereby prompting you to buy which, in concert with others in your shoes, will raise the price. 
Tl;dr: Buy now!

I'm not sure I follow your argument. Correct me if I'm misinterpreting you, but you seem to be implying that there is a causation between the expected value of something and the number of people who use that thing. Is that your premise? 
You'll need a lot of evidence to support that claim, but let's assume that it's true. Why then is bitcoin trading so high compared to other economies of similar scale? Your answer is that it is over valued. But that is only one of many possible explanations, the most obvious being that people who buy bitcoin are typically *far* more wealthy than people who use those other currencies. Another possible explanation is that there is a sudden, but legitimate market demand which has driven up the price. 
There are more options, I'm sure but my point is that if you make a claim about what the price of something *should * be, you are implicitly stating that everyone who pays market price is wrong. And that may be true, but you have only given a possible - perhaps even plausible - explanation without much evidence to support your narrative.

World economies are crumbling and people need a safe place to store some wealth for a while. You aren't going to have any luck convincing savers to spend. I'm holding bitcoin for at least a year and I don't plan on spending one red satoshi. Sorry. Reddit needs to come to grips with this reality.

California has made plans for future hiring. Spain has raised tuition rates among other things. But I was mostly speaking of expected future actions. If you want examples of this occurring in the past, look no further than Greece and Argentina. I'm not clear on the argument you're making here.

Of course. That's why I was speaking in generalities. Not all business is impacted but the net effect is negative.

This implies that the only way to generate wealth in the bitcoin economy is to mine Bitcoins, an absurd proposition. I've never mined in my life, yet I have increased my wealth through bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:06:44
The second option seems like a bad idea, imho.  If you want those bitcoins at a later date, you can always buy them then.  Hell, you could deposit directly into mt. gox or bitfloor and have your coins in less time.
FWIW, I find it much easier to use coinbase on their android mobile app.  It doesn't even ask about the second option.  And it's easier to repeatedly attempt a buy order.
@_date: 2013-07-18 03:20:36

When the price is doubling in a matter of weeks, you need to lower your price, even if that means selling for lower than you paid. Admittedly that's risky. But imagine if you had made a sale at 90% price last week. You'd be way up right now. 
My point is that upswings encourage saving. So you can either wait for the price to stabilize or you can offer a discount. But selling at normal price isn't going to work at this particular moment.

I completely agree. When I said disprove, I meant it in a colloquial sense which, as you rightly point out, is not *proof* in the literal sense. The real thrust of my point is that many people lack the basic understanding which is common to all (or nearly all) branches of economics, such as supply /demand, price discovery, etc. This lack of knowledge makes them incapable of understanding the arguments put forth by any specific branch of economics, much less to critique those branches. 
I hope that makes more sense. 
@_date: 2013-08-30 17:38:56
"Hoarding" as you call it only makes the coins on circulation more valuable. There are perfectly legitimate reasons for saving. It doesn't hurt the bitcoin economy one bit. It's time to realize that the Keynesian analysis of fiat money doesn't apply to a free economy. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 18:10:46
Sure thing. Typically the evidence used to say that we are in a bubble is the sudden increase in value without any corresponding change in functionality. The inference is that the demand is driven by an unfounded belief in an increased expected future value. 
The inverse explains how an artificially low value can occur. Demand is low because there is an unfounded belief in a lower expected future value.

I don't understand how that's possible. I've clicked buy literally hundreds of times at this point. 
Also, since I unsuccessfully tried transferring my coins, the mobile app is giving me an error that it can't sync. I'm not saying they're trying to scam me. But I am saying that this is completely unacceptable service combined with utter silence when I tried to contact them. 
They've lost my business for good. Several friends of mine are planning on buying their first coins this week too and they're asking me to guide them. I can't recommend coinbase after this debacle.
