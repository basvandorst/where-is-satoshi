Bitcoin is Bitcoin,
Dyl000 is Dyl000
If I make Dyl000 Cash forked from Dyl000, Dyl000 will still be the Dyl000 as it always was and always will be. But sure, go ahead and keep calling yourself the original Dyl000 if you feel the need to point it out. To anyone else, it's pretty clear already.
How does that sound Dyl000, or would you rather want me to call you Dyl000 Core or Dyl000 Legacy?

Yea, your profile looks definitely better. Redditor for 3 months, 1 post karma, 4 comment karma. You can't find single valid reason, why BCH promoting channel should be on BTC related page (similarly to BTC content not making any sense on BCH page), so you start attacking people personally.
Bitcoin's strongest weapon is it's community and people like you are just very pitiful beings. No idea what drives you to act this way, but I don't care. Just STFU and go do some promo over to r/btc. 
Also, not going to reply to any further post, I expressed myself clearly.

I know your intention was good, but people in the world are trying to scam everyone... if you are listening to them, it's actually only your problem. Everyone who buys something properly is doing some research first and easily figures out what garbage Bcash is and what their methods are about.

Meanwhile @ Roger:
"Someone is spamming the Bcash network and it is very sad that core puppets are acting like this. This is targeted attack against me... I meant... Bcash. And whoever is doing this, he should stop immediately, because this kind of attack is bad. It's totally unlike when I'm spamming BTC network! Wait... I meant.... err... that's not how it is, I'm self made millionaire and you should listen to me!!!"

This high fee argument is becoming so boring. It's as if someone tried to get you to his cheap thing by saying:
"Lambo, you say? Do you really want to drive such expensive car where you need to pay high price for fuel? You can't even buy a coffee while in car. Just come here and use this cheap skateboard..."
Whoever would say this to you is probably missing the point of Lambo as much as Bitcoin.

Thank you, but I'm not. I wrote "paying with crypto where possible". Crypto means not only BTC. I use BTC, LTC, fiat, depending on the circumstances, but usually the cheapest, but fast enough method. Right now BTC is not as fast and convenient to use for payments, but I'm a developer. I know what development means and that good solutions take always some time.

My touch bar shows data in format:
Price in satoshi | Value in BTC = $Value (% Gain)
For example:
50 | 0.05 BTC = $800 (200%)

@_date: 2017-12-22 12:55:44
Just be patient guys... it's being worked on and I'm sure we will see everything resolved in next few months. If Ver wants to keep this going, he should better prepare escape plan. Because if someone like him managed to make Bcash, there are many more people who want to try and get a piece of this cake. And if companies like Coinbase are working against us, I bet we will soon see a solutions. And either those idiots get in line, or stay behind with regrets.
There is NO TURNING POINT for anyone who can comprehend what's happening right now. Just stop watching charts, go out for a while and enjoy your life. It will be more rich every day no matter what and everything fixed in no time;)

**You're not the only one.**
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:05:46
You are right, I didn't say anything else than if you buy thing you really need for 1 BTC or $15k, it is irrelevant as both of these piles represent same value at the time of purchase. Even if only for very short time.
I wasn't suggesting you should prefer BTC or fiat, it was just plain fact. If you are interested in my opinion, I'm paying with crypto where possible to help the adoption and then recharging with fiat (if needed). At most places this is not possible yet, so fiat is mostly preferred payment option. 
However, I see the value in this tech and see it highly undervalued. But even if you believe in it, you are missing the point. Let's say you have both BTC and fiat and you need to pay for living. You can do it two ways:
1) pay with fiat
2) pay with btc (and optionally: buy the btc back with fiat if you have more fiat left)
This is not only helping the Bitcoin and showing merchants people are using it, but it's actual use of it as a currency. If you are unable to see the bigger picture, you are doing it wrong and should not be giving anyone any advice.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:15:29
I didn't say anything about what I believe in or not, I'm just presenting it as valid approach and will repeat it for you:


I'm seeing BTC as store of value right now and that's it. If it becomes fiat-like usable currency or not, I have no idea. But it's fact you can buy stuff with it right now.

It's like getting investment loan and once you are slightly in profit, pay it all off, leaving you just with a bit. I would personally just keep it all and once a year, use 10% to pay debts. First year you maybe pay just part of it with 10% of your crypto, but next year the 10% can cover the rest.
But I personally would keep it all and pay it once the debt is no more than 10% of your assets. You are risking ofc, that it drops to zero (not an option for anyone properly educated) before you can pay the debt, but how would that be different without having this unique opportunity? The risk/reward is amazing and worth taking if you ask me. And difference between paying it now and paying it in a year is difference between getting your life a complete freedom in 1 year, or next 5 years. Because the more value you own, the faster you get more. Paying entire debt now is foolish and huge leap back. Your call...
And those who think that it's good to pay it now and get freedom, I say no matter if he pays it now or later, he already has the freedom. He has resources to get rid of it instantly and he has freedom to do so anytime he wish (actually, his wife does).

Yes, I'm aware that vast majority can't understand this. They are chasing hype and doing it wrong. But it's ok, we need such people.
If everyone did it the right way, it would simply work for everyone except the last few % of population who would jump in to see correction, but the price would stabilize after and slowly increase to new ATH as the coins in circulation would decrease (based on key losses and higher world population).
But as most of people do it wrong, there are losers too. And all just because of greed and fear my friend, greed and fear.
Finally, when it comes to fees, I couldn't care less. If I wanted, can get transaction confirmed in 2 hours for fair price. It's people's stupidity they pay more and use services that don't want to add segwit. But this will get solved soon and whoever is trying to block the evolution will get hurt the most powerful way - in their wallets.

You don't get that everyone has some living costs and basic needs? If you want to invest, do it with excess money. But some people are keeping it in bitcoin because they actually believe it and acts as store of value, but it's not preventing you from using it for payments as well. Let's say that what you needed to buy was food. 2 options only: either you buy it with BTC or die hungry. I don't know anyone, who would choose BTC over his own life. That's all I'm trying to point out.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:46:59
I agree with you absolutely, I'm rational person, following logic:) You know, the initial comment was meant to be short fact... it wasn't my intention to make it look like advice. For expressing all my opinions, I would need several pages. But the fact is there there are individuals who are simply using BTC for payments. And there are merchants who accept it either directly or via gateway. Yes, all of those are early birds, but it's actually proving it can be used.
What it means for different sorts of people is different story.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:05:24
He doesn't have to. If you want or need to buy something, it doesn't matter if you pay it in fiat or btc. The value at the purchase time is equal. The question is only if you need it now and if you won't regret it later.

Normally it's correct that most of people is wrong. But when most of weak hands leave and only smart/patient/strong hands remain, you can't use this rule anymore. Ultimately, at the final bottom, everyone still holding is right:) And at the end of every cycle, there is more people who know there is no way back for them and who are in not to make money, but to replace money.

Someone should make few more and get them to exchanges:
- Bitcoin Crash for people who think Bitcoin is a bubble. This coin has special consensus rules. Each block any miner is signaling "It's a fraud", inflation will kick in and next block reward will be 1% higher. Price crashes guaranteed on daily basis.
- Bitcoin Clash for people who like to argue over blocksize increase. This network's software is automatically setting up virtual node for fees from mined block and trying to force UASF blocksize increase two times. This is forcing users to create more and more nodes in order to keep the blocksize low. If users screw up, noone will be able to run nodes soon.
- Bitcoin Cashh which is Satoshi Nakamoto's true vision bla bla bla... It's using domain BitcoinCash.com and it's the only and real Bitcoin Cash.

Greed causes people to seek advantage in any way possible. Making better HW and secretly using it is one way to get there. ASIC is just specialized HW and will exist for any application where people are incentivized to do so. With ASIC-resistance, they may not be 100x or more faster than multi-purpose HW like GPU (which is kind of ASIC too), but even if taken to extreme, 1.5-3x is still worth doing so and XMR is good example how ASIC-resistance is failing miserably.
Networks have two real defense lines. 1st, it's hashrate and ASICs are good for it. Either they are well distributed and this defense line works naturally, or they are not well distributed (or even secretly used) and that secures the network as well, because such party is incentivized to do so. They do it for money and attacking network is not on their shopping list ad it's equal to turning their entire manufacturing/operations into very expensive brick walls.
Second line of defense are full nodes. Individual users and parties running the software who can proceed with fork.

Bitcoin innovation is like: horse wagon -&gt; train -&gt; freighter ship -&gt; teleportation

This will hopefully change. We may not enjoy it for long, but our kids will. Nations, religions and walls are falling over time. It's the same with Bitcoin, it's still early, but the old world and rules is dying with it's users. I'm 33 now, I was born into the technology explosion and remember well how it was before and how it is now. Could I imagine this all back then? No way... Can I imagine now what will be one or two decades from now? Nope. But I know that technological progress will play major role in it and thanks to internet and manufacturing progress any shift is going to be way faster. Kids that are born today won't understand those people we are right now the same as we are wondering about sanity of those who rule the world now. I don't know what happens, who wins or who loses, but the world will either be in ashes, or more open and united with cryptocurrencies backing the evolution.
Am I naive? Am I dreamer? Definitely. I know how it looks like to those who can't see beyond their tiny borders. But it's this kind of people who are working on change no matter the odds.

There will always be inequality because people are not equal in their skills and conditions. Some are smart, some are dumb, some work hard, some are lazy, some can only talk while few can actually do something to change their state. Don't be ignorant.
World where everyone is absolutely equal is impossible. Would you want to feed those who have absolutely no interest in changing their life and can only come up with excuses and bad mouthing others? History made sure that only strong (or lucky) ones get successful. You need to do something or risk something in order to get better.
But no matter who you are and what are your skills, you don't need to be rich to enjoy the life with your close ones. There are things money can't buy you.

I'm tired of this and while I was just respecting BCH as alternative currency, people behind it are simply pushing too far. Will NEVER touch it, even if it was 10 times higher than BTC. It's scam coin with fraudsters in control and only someone insane or foolish would trust them.

There will be corrections, but Bitcoin is long term a good store of value. Those who are using it this way couldn't care about high fees less. High fees will eventually decrease as the scaling improves and even now, you can send Bitcoin around at a low costs. You just need to wait longer, but if you are moving it from exchange to your wallet to hodl, couldn't you care less about the time? Bitcoin is our flagship until CCs are mainstream and publicly accepted by majority. In the end, all that really matters now is just trust.

Alright, great job John and I say this as person who made own research and own opinion. Not brainwashed, not brainwashing.

These sites that promise you big rewards are called ponzi scheme. Users are motivated to get in as many new users and get big bonuses for it. But this only works as long as there is influx of new users who keep putting money in that are used for paying rewards for higher level users (with top level users being creators of that site).
Check out BitConnect in google or youtube and it's story. People didn't listen to warnings that it's clear ponzi. Then one day it suddenly stopped and quickly went to zero.
Btw, you just answered it yourself... "this sounds cool" -&gt; always rationally think about intentions and business model behind any project. You cannot trust any company to do something for you and for free. There is always price, or it's a scam.
If you want to do something good for you, use this opportunity to educate yourself about Bitcoin and what it truly is. Most of people see it as investment, but in reality it's something way more, it's the world's most solid form of money, the only global money that you have absolute control (and also responsibility, there is no support to call for help, no company you can sue for your mistakes) of no matter what your government or bank are saying. You can send it to anyone who you teach how to accept it. You can leave your country's economy without physically leaving the country. This is the true power of Bitcoin. Most people don't need Bitcoin yet, but with traditional finance systems collapsing, the need will grow, one by one.
Now, start reading. Your first task in 2019 is to learn how Bitcoin works. Jameson Lopp made really great job by putting everything you need in one place: [

It might take years, but it's inevitable and all the manpower you mentioned works on making this better, faster and super easy to use. Bitcoin is the money, hardest money that exist and the core user base cannot be shaken :)

The main problem of S2X is not in the block increase (which is not really needed to be rushed right now), but in the missing replay protection. It's attack on bitcoin by bunch of greedy miners. We as a community should make sure that only one who loses will be them.
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:11:35
After reading several comments, I have to add my thoughts:
- whatever any nation's government will attempt to shut this down will fail, because so many people and companies are looking forward into this and invested that each of them will be doing the best to protect his investments and beliefs, either by relocating mining, or enabling every possible phone or computer to serve as miner until the crysis is over... all these issues are just tests showing the way to real decentralisation
- if this is war, war against technology, development, evolution, we already won, just look at every past war... and every new tech will just help to make this easier and more affordable to anyone... long range communications are getting faster, computers are getting faster and in not so distant future, everyone might run a node at home... try to shut that down, lol:)
- if you wanna really, like seriously, shut it down, only way is to shut down internet... but trust me one thing, I don't think anyone wants to get back to medieval and especially not the younger generation that didn't have to live without it... you can see people raging when major services have few hours of outage... shut it down and you have them all in the streets:)
- if I was anyone who is being threatened by this, if not earlier already, by now I would absolutely be working on way to embrace it and see this as huge opportunity instead of fighting it
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:17:38
Yes, I don't mine BTC right now, but when the fork gets near, I will switch to BTC in order to help. I don't care it's not efficient as with ASIC. We need to protect our Bitcoin and long term, it's profit anyway:)

This. No matter how big sell offs we see, the only question is at which price even more massive buys will get triggered. There is too many people who know how the bitcoin works and won't be fooled easily by anyone saying opposite, to stop this.
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:11:03
1) You're right that not every non-miner is against it. I should say majority, because there are simply people like you. The Bitfinex trading clearly proves where the true support is.
2) Coinbase is licensed exchange and unless they want to be sued, they won't ever list B2X as BTC. You should read the licensing conditions. They will list B2X if the hard fork happens, but not as B2X. Majority hashrate may be B2X, so it's true. Also, while majority support may be B2X if miners really wan't to lose money, what is important are the nodes running latest Core software. And I don't mind if we have to wait for block a bit longer. It's only temporary anyway until miners switch back as their loyalty is only to money.
3) Replay protection - Yes, it's optional and sucks as well as all other arguments about need to increase block size.
4) Core is not an company, it's title that represents everyone who made Bitcoin what it is today. Everyone who makes the code, runs the nodes and helps the Bitcoin community is part of it. It's open and you should know by now. You sir, are clearly heavily involved in S2X to support it. And I respect it. But the community will decide the outcome and you should stop this crap. Because S2X is best thing that could happen to Bitcoin... it will make it stronger and prove that not even this kind of attack can bring centralization to it.
As long as people are educated and can make own opinion, no such forked altcoin can succeed. If you wanna continue in this argumenting, be my guest. But please, explain your standing in more detail and technical background, so everyone can see the logic behind.

I wonder why every S2X supporter thinks it's only core against it. I'm not associated with core or any other party. I follow my personal interests. And as a Bitcoin user, I am against S2X, because it's threat to something I believe in. Blaming Core for everything is nonsense. People have own brains (only some of them obviously) and follow own interests. And number of nodes speaks clearly.

I said "bunch of greedy miners". Not all miners are like those. And while the whole thing is mostly being driven by greed (after all, it's a store of value), greed should also prevent this thing from happening. Because if we are really greedy, we should make sure we picked the right side.

I'm totally against S2X, but instead of doing compromises, I think it's better to just stay loyal to original chain (if you can, run latest core full node) and wait till B2X falls into oblivion. Let the Core do what's best, I don't think compromises are on their roadmap, especially such compromises that are not needed at all.
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:04:09
If hashrate dropped by 95% for short time, this would send clear message from the community. Strength in numbers. And that's significant. (however, of course... getting some more ASICs would help more:D)

@_date: 2017-10-08 00:40:44
Just so it is clear to everyone. Didn't you make this decision just because other S2X supporters say so and because bigger blocks are so cool, right? I assume you did own research, so you figured out the reason why every non-miner is against it, why big and especially licensed (like Coinbase) exchanges will have to keep user's coins safe and why they won't ever list any forked chain with BTC ticker. People want BTC and any forked coin will just get dumped into oblivion. Especially one without proper replay protection and without miner's support. Or you really think that anyone will mine coin with same difficulty that everyone just keeps dumping? It won't be worth mining and miners are following profit. I'm quite sorry for any users of your site that trust you.
And I ask entire Bitcoin/NO2X community to keep educating and under each post like the one above answer with how the things really are so not a single user gets confused that S2X is good. It's not good and not even necessary. It's only aim is to take control from Core and do as much damage as possible to main chain.
By the way, do you wanna buy my old card? It's gonna have "Lambo" ticker after the hard fork so it's the real thing, right?:)
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:58:56
90% is only majority of miners. In next weeks this support will collapse terribly under the pressure of users. What I'm curious about is... if few days before scheduled activation this support drops to be low enough that even supporting miners will be in minority, shouldn't they finally admit that implementing replay protection is their responsibility?:)
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:25:28
Just ignore them:) It's the meaning of their lifes. The vast majority is fine.
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:50:12
Argumenting that replay protection is not needed is really poor argument. You think that everyone will follow, trust and give all that Bitcoin represents into hands of single developer and bunch of so-called hashrate majority? Just because "you know, we have majority of hashrate". I don't think so. 
Bitcoin was designed to resist such threats and attempts of centralization and is only as strong as are it's users. Until now, I wasn't running any node, I was just mining for few months, but everyone who is involved in crypto should take steps to protect their investments. No matter what you or the miners will do, I'm going to setup and run latest full node by Bitcoin Core today and anyone who cares should follow and run &lt;the software of his/her choice&gt;.
And 100min blocks? I couldn't care less... I don't believe you and the miners supporting S2X. You think that market must follow miners and you are trying to force it and spread all your lies, but the reality is that miners will have to follow the market... or lose money. They need to make money and any time spent on S2X altcoin won't generate them any.
However, I respect your opinion and I'm not trying to persuade you. I'm writing this for everyone else to make own opinion and instead of simply trusting someone else, try to research as much as you can, because only then you will know where the truth is.
@_date: 2017-10-07 09:34:02
And that's the only reason why we need to do it immediately? You can't really see how wrong this is? Increasing block size now is not a solution. Core is doing great solutions and thanks to Segwit there is a way for activation of more exciting features that actually solve problems.
By the way, you answered it yourself by saying "slightly larger blocks fixes that for now". FOR NOW. It's not a permanent solution, it's not a good solution. It's just a distraction from the main problem - lack of replay protection.
If you really only wanted to see larger blocks and lower fees, you would have no problems with implementing proper replay protection, right? If you believe that S2X is the future of Bitcoin, what are you afraid of that it has no replay protection?
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:25:27
Bitfinex introduced Split Chain Tokens few months ago for those situations. If it was the opposite (everyone supporting S2X), don't you think that by this moment, B2X would be traded higher than bitcoin right now?
You can see it for yourself:
BTC/USD - $3400
B2X/USD - $1100
B2X/BTC - 0.25
It's just one exchange, but it has quite a lot of users to show where the community's loyalty stays. People will dump it hard as they did with BCH, because you know what? It's free money. Why risking supporting such dangerous (it's not really dangerous, only for people who are listening to the wrong people) fork and losing money?
I cannot understand why anyone thinks that he can use someone else's work (it's open source, so it's alright, no issue with that) and try to release it with not a single upgrade and present it as the real thing under same name.
Imagine if game like GTA 5 was open source made by hundreds of people, someone then took it, increased texture resolution 2x and tried to sell it as GTA 5 on same channels as the developer company. Company, that's meanwhile working not only on much better resolution scaling, but also amazing new features making the gameplay much better. That's how this situation looks like.
Whoever wants to support S2X, just do it. Unlike the miners claiming 95% support and forcing everyone into S2X by their agreement, that most of us didn't ever agreed to, no one is forcing you into BTC here. You are free to chose.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:03:58
I think you get it a bit wrong. If B2X gets to 30 or even 50% early, it will be dumped to ground by big hodlers:) No-one sane is going to buy B2X, only delusional people trying to get rich quickly by buying the "new BTC" cheaply:) I don't think the market works this way. Bitcoin is only as strong as it's community and if it can't withstand this attack easily, there is no future anyway and going with B2X would just make resistance against contentious future changes even more difficult.
For me, personally, the idea beyond Bitcoin, it's update process and consensus matters the most and there cannot be compromises. If BTC shows as weak, there is no future to it anyway. So only way is to stick with BTC and dump any forked altcoin. I'm not interested in any centralized 3rd party telling us to follow their behind-the-door made terms. That's not how it works.
And yes, I will keep my BTC even if it becomes minority chain. I will keep them for years and grab some more as long as there is progress in development. Because when the things over other chain get bad (and it will), guess what happens.
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:06:44
Let's say:
- BTC goes up at least 2 times per year on average, after $50000 it goes up by $50000/year and each halving increases this increment value 2 times
- each halving will double the price quickly, next one is in 2020, then 2024, which is 7 years from now
2017: $7000
2018: $14000
2019: $28000
2020: $56000 -&gt; halving -&gt; $112000
2021: $222000
2022: $322000
2023: $422000
2024: $522000 -&gt; halving -&gt; $1000000+
This is not actually something I think it will happen, because mass adoption would create absolutely different type of curve, but I'm just trying to point out how $1M would be possible using historical performance of Bitcoin and fact that halving is like steroids for it:)
@_date: 2017-10-07 09:00:56
Better question is: What 2x has to offer that you and "The Almighty Miners" support it? It's not solving anything, it's not needed at all and it's only feature being no (or very poor/optional and confusing) replay protection is not really an upgrade.

Fact you can't see masses of users opposed to this is not making the opposite be true. There are no masses of users supporting it. You explained it pretty well, 99% of bitcoin ecosystem doesn't care about this. But people care about their assets, which bitcoin is. They invested in bitcoin, it's full ecosystem and not into hard fork forced by miners. It's nice to post percents around, but next time you do it, please post stats of entire ecosystem, not only one part trying to play the god.
@_date: 2017-10-08 00:24:40
This thread was meant to express my belief that there will be no support for S2X once the dust settles and any company that would dare to use BTC ticker for B2X will just ruin itself. Any sane user should be careful and move their BTC to safety before it ends with tears for them.
@_date: 2017-10-07 08:49:02
I don't think so. It's about education and money. I believe in fact that people want to protect their investments and best thing to do is if each home runs own multi-purpose computer. It can act as node, miner, storage host and so on. People don't need to know how it works, only that it pays it's own running costs, including internet connection, serves as media/IoT center, makes them some extra money and most of all, secures the network, makes it trully decentralized. I hear about people doing this every day and I'm going to do the same. Someone will surely make huge business out of this:)

At your age with no existential issues, you should not only put into bitcoin, but also research another coins being traded in pairs with btc and split your portfolio a bit. It's best way to increase your btc holdings if you pick a good coin with solid project, strong community and talented team behind.

I think that the right answer is in between. It's good to have plan, but at that range it's best to keep your resources split. You don't have to go 100% fiat, because again, you don't know what will happen to it. Better to reduce the risks and keep holdings in both crypto and fiat or other investments (as long as fiat or the other investments have any use).

You responded on question if mining is still viable. I suppose the guy was interested if it's worth it starting now, not on the cpu as in 2010. And starting now with current HW made for mining is definitely viable and worth the electricity as long as you believe in this tech.

You, sir, are just proving your inability to see the bigger picture and understand the technology behind. Posts around explained it nicely, yet you keep going about this blocksize increase right now, when it's not really necessary and you are not realizing what consequences it has. Your only argument here is actual network, but you can't comprehend the entire ecosystem and it's development.
Yet, I think this attack on Bitcoin is necessary to happen and there are many more to come, each making it stronger. What you see is decentralization at it's best - Bitcoin's auto-immunity system kicking in to fight the virus. It's nice to watch, as those community reactions make me actually believe in it.

Probably it's best to watch this discussion between S2X/NYA signer and guys that understand Bitcoin really deeply. The discussion starts around 10:00 and Vinny (S2X) joins it after 25 minutes.
TL;DR: S2X is 51% attack on bitcoin and aims to disrupt and centralize it, also giving control over it into hands of few companies. They want to reach this by claiming they have majority of hashrate and support (dropping every day as signers realize they were abused as they initially signed it believing it will solve scaling issues), while completely ignoring that community doesn't want it and shows it by running and upgrading full nodes (0.15 or higher versions) with overwhelming majority. Full nodes are core of bitcoin network, not the miners. Hashrate is only service that gets paid for the work. Also everyone should know that if S2X succeeded, defending the Bitcoin against any other future contentious change would be even more difficult (bigger blocksize means less devices would be capable of running full node) and they could even change crucial parameters of Bitcoin.
Main features are: 2x block size (not needed, we have Segwit activated already and it's better to let core devs come with more long term solutions), lack of proper replay protection (will result in confusion and money loss) and code repo being mess maintained by single developer, J. Garzik.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:22:44
At that time, I hope BTC mining will be more decentralized again with more players and individual people in the field. And I suppose many would be running it even while less profitable or temporarily not profitable, because they don't care about current price, they are in for the long run. Price will adjust to reflect the scarcity.

If it was me, I would tell him to shut up and listen. If they don't want to take care of the fiat money on my account anymore, we can cancel my account right away. I can operate fully without any bank account, get directly paid for work in bitcoin and spread the word across significant number of people near to me.
And also I would recommend him to put a picture showing  historical graph of "total bank account users" growth over his bed, because it's obviously a bubble, it will burst soon and all he has left are the memories.

The thing is it's not a single rig. That's why. First rig is limited to 4 GPU, second is my gaming desktop pc that mines with both GPU and when I want to play sometimes, I mine only with one GPU. And since I plan to mine in future only with ASIC, there is no need to change the HW I currently run.
With any number of GPU you want to run, you should look for 4GB (6GB preferred) memory cards if you want to run it long term and make sure your MB has sufficient number of PCIe slots. I personally would get 6x 1070s. While more expensive than 1060s, they have much bigger hashrate and higher resale value, so if you get ever tired of mining, you can sell it to pc gamers. But also, those GPUs are on market for some time, so it's up to you if you want to start mining now or wait for next generation HW. I'm no oracle, but what's great one day can be obsolete soon.

With 1 BTC, next year you can buy at least 10 computers and pay the guy to make a comic about it.

I don't know, if the market showed us something, then it is that we are always too low with the expectations and it will surprise us again.

What are you trying to tell me, that I won't have to when the market is ready?

Then it should be good they won't have much gains this year, right? :) /s
