Not to mention the morbid curiosity. I am scared of learning about chemical warfare now because it might end me up on a list...

My curiosity is boundless.

Except there is no regulation on bitcoin to prevent it from bursting. It is entirely free market and it does not self regulate.

You can go to a casino with the same money, bet it all on the third row at the roulette and make about the same.
Doesn't mean it is a good idea. Bitcoin could have crashed, but didn't. I hope he did his research before investing, cause if not, then he is a big idiot, but with more money.

And a bitcoin is electronic. There is no weight behind it. You can't get paid on it and you can barely pay with it. 
Also, someone that owns 30.000 bitcoin can sell it all, dip the market, buy it again and profit. Do it with any regulated currency or stocks and you are a market manipulator that gets hefty fines and even jail time. 
I like bitcoin, but it is alarming how fast it is rising. It will burst. 
Bitcoin is like any other currency in that if you want to exchange it, someone has to buy it. Banks or governments usually do that and are kinda required to do that the currency is stable. Bitcoin has no such mechanism in place to support it. 
Bitcoin can barely buy anything without being sold first. 
And I say this as a bitcoin investor (small scale). It will burst. 
Right now, the main attraction of bitcoin is that you don't need anyone else to be in the chain. It is anonymous. It's also a online currency so you don't need coins and thus can be split indefinitely. Which are really good things when you can't mine any more (at around 21 million I think). 
However, if no one can buy with it and no one is buying it, you can't use it and it crashes. It is rising in the hopes that it will be similar to a legal currency in that you can buy your groceries with it.

Good fucking luck. Icelandic and dating a foreigner. It was a nightmare getting her here.
You should try to get a job before getting here. Or marry an Icelander. Or start school here. 
Then you might be able to come here.
Unless you're European. Then you could be the poorest bastard with crippling addiction and a plan to live off of the welfare system and people would be like "he's from Europe. Open the gates!!!"
