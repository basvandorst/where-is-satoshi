Still fairly new to cryptocurrencies. I set up a small test transaction of BTC from one exchange to another. It went through in about 2 minutes. 
Sent a second, much larger, amount of BTC to exactly the same wallet address and while the transaction is confirmed, the second total hasn't shown up in my second account yet. Does this take longer sometimes?

I truly hope I'm wrong, that's why I kept 2/3 of it. But usually nothing that grows this fast is sustainable. I didn't mind holding through the Chinese closing exchanges. I didn't mind holding when Jamie Dimon made his comments. But +40% in 40 hours is truly remarkable. Time to take back my money and let the rest ride.
Absolutely buying back at some point but I'll wait for a correction.

Joined the bitcoin club and was wondering how to send/receive bitcoin. Do I give someone my deposit address and have them send it there?

Bought at $4000. Sold 1/3 of my coin this afternoon. This is too stressful and anything can happen going into next week. I feel so much better knowing everything now is house money.

His entire approach to investing is based on valuation. There's no book value vs stock price when it comes to crypto. People ask him the same question all the time about bitcoin and his answer stays the same. He's not going to invest in something he doesn't understand.
I don't think he hates bitcoin. I think he's just getting tired of the questions

Isn't that the guy that gave a tour of his house in a youtube ad and it came out later that he rented the house for a weekend?
