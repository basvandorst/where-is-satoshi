I dunno, they printed/issued $200,000,000 today and a total of $750,000,000 in January.
Perhaps big exchanges are indeed getting that much money in fiat from people wanting to get in on the dip and then the exchange converts it to tether. But it's a hell of a high amount.
They could solve a lot of FUD by just making an audit by a legit 3rd party. But for some reason they wont.

There are 420 days in the past years where the value has been more than 30% lower than it was exactly one year prior that.
A majority of these days are from the 2013-2015 dip.
Example:    
On May 4th 2014, price was 429    
On May 4th 2015, price was 237 (-45%)     
This would count as 1 dip
On May 5th 2014, price was 438     
On May 5th 2015, price was 239 (-46%)       
This would count as another dip   
There is just a lot of days in 2015 that is more than 30% lower than the same day in 2014 that is boosting the numbers

That site is buying a share in robot trading, so depending on your investment and how well the robot "works" (which is probably completely chosen by them) you get a specific share of profits.
For example for 2017 they list a 100% return in a year where bitcoin went up 1600%. 
They claim on their site the daily profit is 0.38%. Which would be about 6 dollars per day for you. Regardless of how much bitcoin actually rises. Their own calculator actually puts it at $2.51 dollars per day, which would be a measly 0.14% return. This would equal 0.91% return in a week where bitcoin went up 17%.
Next time, maybe do a research where you put your money first. You clearly have no clue what you bought, it's all cleartext on the site.

This is great, but the more I read the more I realize I misunderstood ln. I so while felt it was a passive system that would help relay smaller transactions by routing through people's dormant nodes.
But now it seems its very much an active system? Leaving a lightning node alone for more than a few days seems to be at risk to get punished with loss of stakes?

A recent survey on this sub showed there was an even split 50/50 if people thought they were early adopters or not.
So it is a matter of opinion.
But considering the timespan of some mechanics of BTC, like the halving every 210,000 blocks, 99% of coins mined in 2035 and 100% of coins mined in 2140 you could argue 9 years is nothing.

If the hashrate goes up/down it still takes a little while before the difficulty is adjusted, this would mean that blocks are discovered faster than every 10 minutes temporarily until difficulty is adjusted. Over 9 years I believe this has moved the estimate from Sept 2140 to April 2140.
So over the course of 120 years, it might be enough to nudge it a few years.

I dunno, I think their "printing" lines up pretty well with times when people would be depositing huge amounts into exchanges, so I really don't find it impossible that they simply are converting deposited money into tether. 
But of course I can understand why people are suspicious.
In the end there is no real proof of either way and it's based on trust and a little bit of ignorance right now.
Still no major reason to spread FUD, the btc price does correct itself, has dips and generally does healthy things. I would be more worried if it never stopped rallying from December.

Lately, as in the few days transactions for 2-5sat/byte has gone through and been confirmed. Not sure where you are getting 190sat/byte but it is crossly inflated (coinbase?)
Now, past few hours the mempool has been filled with pretty expensive tx up towards 100-140sat/byte, so the 2-5sat/byte might not be valid now as of today. It is impossible to say if it will go down again right now. 
But my guess is that 5-10sat/byte will clear within a few days, but that is a guess assuming the number of transactions doesn't increase.
Edit: 8sat/byte and 9sat/byte just got confirms, so 10sat/byte should be good for the moment.

210 times it has gone down +30% over a month   
420 times it has gone down +30% over a year    
Seems reasonable   
But I see your point, I did some quick math and this adds up to like 3600 data points, which is surprising considering bitcoin was coined only 3300 days ago and coindesk data is only 2500 days or so.  I guess I might be just as confused as you now.

You actually take half the profit and half the initial investment, since you are only taking out half of your holdings
Lets say you bought 0.1 bitcoin at $10000. Total $1000.
The price increases to $20000 and your holdings is worth $2000.
Now you buy a burger for 0.05BTC. Then it's is calculated from that sell alone. So it checks what price you bought it at, which was $10000, so it was worth $500 in the start. When you sold it that 0.05BTC was worth $1000, so you made a $500 profiit and that gets taxed. 
You now got a $1000 burger, Some Capital gains tax to pay and $1000 left in your account, of which $500 is the rest of the profit that you have not realized yet.

I am still confused about the punishment in LN. I imagine I would want to just be a hub/node with balance, having a few open channels that makes the network stronger and expands the number of routes others can take. In a very passive manner.
But as I understand lately is that in order for to be a LN node I need to be pretty active and maintain it? Because if someone tries to cheat and I do not discover it, they get away with it after a week?
Is there a system within LN where I don't use it as a payment system at all, but rather as a passive node that just connects people?

Since transactions are getting confirmed for 2sat/byte and even 1 sat/byte it means coinbase is overpaying the fee by over 10000%

You are still thinking of Moody's or S&amp;P which indeed did rate AAA+ and similar because they basically had monetary incentive to give good ratings.
That doesn't make Weiss bad, which had E rating on 90% of failed 600 banks in the past decade at the point of collapse. They had one single A rating out of those 600, which was due to false reporting of accounting.
Do I agree with the bitcoin rating, of course not, but the attempt to paint them in bad light cause you remember hearing some shit about rating agencies in the past and just assume Weiss was one of the bad ones is not the way to go.

Of course it is speculation, what if some exchanges keep most of their fiat funds in USDT instead of USD. if Tether crashes, would they then become insolvent and close shop or would they still be able to deal with it?
But would it cause anything else than "Told you so" moments and maybe a few chaotic days/weeks? Doubt it.
Then again it is impossible to know how people would react, some of them seem to be selling for the smallest bad news and USDT problems would not be small in their eyes.

Hyperdeflation in a "real world" currency is basically purely hypothetical as it really never happened in a scale we would call "Hyper". It has natural brakes because the more a currency is worth, the more willing people are to spend it and borrow it, causing higher inflation.
In the end people do pay taxes on using and earning dollars as well, it's just such a natural thing you probably don't think about it as much as in the crypto world.
In any regard the previous poster is correct, using your BTC in any capacity is a taxable event. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:11:39
This is correct, segwit does not fit in more transactions in the same blocksize. It rather segregates the witness (segwit) so it is put in an extension of the block at the very end. So it's a pseudo blocksize increase. The Witness part is not scrapped, it still has to be included somehow.

It's called FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and in my honest opinion its the wrong reason to get in. Bitcoin is not a get rich fast scheme and it will at some point drop 20% or 30% or even more, then it will go up again and then it will drop a little again. Most of us are not gonna be around when the final bitcoin is mined in 2140, even less can tell if it truly will be around then.
If you believe in BTC, then I advice you to set up a buy where you feel you are standing safely with your feet on the ground. Do not invest recklessly based on emotions, you will react with emotions when absolutely harmless things happen (e.g Sell when it drops 5%) and then you will be even more anxious about buying back in if it starts rising. Its a dangerous vicious cycle.
Slowly buy in with what you can afford, bitcoin has decades to go, not weeks or months.

It was merely a response to someone calling it a tribalist slap fight, so he didn't offer much of a base of a discussion.
If Bitcoin cash/coin can stand on its own feet, then let it. Both coins probably benefit equally from the bitcoin name, but the weird attempt at hostile takeovers of the "brand" is really off-putting.
If anyone of us has the good coin, either BTC or BCH, we should not need the name or brand at all. We should be able to name them whatever. 
Hard forks is just hard forks, they are not inherently bad or good in any way, other than perhaps splitting the community a bit, but I dont think different approaches is a bad thing, if anything the BCH/BTC fork showed that both ways would have worked just fine with a small favor for BCH, cause BTC still undeniably needs to expand segwit and some kind of scaling solution. Even if few truly seems to ackknowledge the emergency.
But as noted, I dont honestly think either BCH or BTC is the future, inherently I think any coin that can have name dropping and "celebs" attached to it, goes against its own purpose.
I however do believe crypto is the way of the future, whatever crypto that might be, I leave unsaid.
But I can apologize for things said, but at this point neither BTC or BCH seems to give two fucks about crypto. Its greed and

I think it mainly was caused by CB introducing BCash in the fashion they did, even if it was known for months. Also there was a ridiculous amount of FUD ("Sell now or you are gonna regret it") type of news and information going around. The coupled with BCH having 4 minutes of fame it triggered some weak hands. It felt a little inevitable with so many new investors not wanting to lose their xmas money.
Then we have the irony of people not wanting to lose money end up being the ones selling low, but that's how it is always gonna be.

They are posted as a scare tactic in both ends. People see huge sell walls, they avoid buying and if people see huge buy walls, they get motivated into buying, thinking it will hit that wall and jump back up, the price momentarily goes up, letting you sell for a higher price before it drops again.
But as soon as it gets close to the wall, the wall is removed, letting it drop even further. Once stabilized, a new fake wall is put up, repeating the process.

If you wanna bet $1500 on bitcoin going down, the contract would be as example $15000 bitcoin with a 10% margin. Now when the price moved up to $16500, you are forced to settle the bet.
The margin is just a kind of security that ensures you are able to settle the bet no matter how the price moves. They are not allowed to "wait it out" when you get margin called, they did bet on it going down after all and they were wrong. It is not far from gambling.

@_date: 2017-12-10 10:46:08
When it comes to futures, you can expose yourself to much more coins because you only need money to cover the losses.
When investing in futures you need to put a margin, a kind of security that if the price moves more than X amount, the contract is settled right away (a margin call). Typical margin is 10%.
For example, if the investor wants to invest $15000 into Bitcoin priced at $15k, he can either buy 1 bitcoin or a future contract holding 10 bitcoin (10% margin for 10 bitcoin = $15000). Now assuming a $1000 increase in price of Bitcoin, if the investor would have invested in the coin, he would earn a profit of $1000, whereas if he took a position in an Bitcoin future contract his profit would be $10000. The obvious risk if it the price drops more than 10% (13500), you would be margin called and have to forfeit the full amount of $15000 to cover the loss.
Another bright side is that you never deal with keys, clients or anything since it is cash-settled. For bitcoin this effect isn't that noticeable, but if you are trading futures in corn, it's nice to not have to deal with tons of corn.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:59:48
This is called arbitrage trading and yes some people do that, but you need the spread to be probably 10% or more (between highest and lowest) to make it viable. In the ones listed there I see at most a 8% spread or similar.
The reason it fails it usually due to fees and other things, you have to do a lot of transferring for this to happen.
transfer fiat to exchange1  
buy at 100  
get bitcoin out of exchange1  
transfer bitcoins to exchange2  
sell at 110  
get fiat out of exchange2  
Depending on the exchange and other factors, you are getting the 10% return once, but you might get a 2% fee on every step, making you lose money.
This is not exclusive to bitcoin and used pretty much everywhere where applicable. It is one of the reasons prices eventually even out to just below 10% spread, because if the spread is bigger than about 10% and fees are reasonable, people start arbitrage trading because there is a profit to be made.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:00:04
You are correct, you can make the margin bigger if you want, increasing the possible loss. One bright side however is that you know that you aren't losing more than the 15k mentioned in the example. Remember they are "betting" on the price going up. The 10% margin of it going down is not what they think it will do.
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:26:22
The price is the last trade made. The bid is what people are willing to pay for it and ask is what people want for it. The lowest ask is sold first and then the price moves to whatever the last trade was.
So the price is not an dictated number, it's the most recent sale price. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:00:38
Cue it being worth a lot more than 3500, as you expect.

The only way to cancel an unconfirmed transaction is to double-spend the bitcoin with a higher fee, so the new transaction is mined/confirmed before the first one and invalidates it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:13:56
The problem is not that they introduced BCH, that is fine. Nor that they did it before January 1st, as announced.
The problem is that the price went up a lot several hours before it was live. The problem is that a few reddit users said they had information from coinbase employees before the introduction.
There is a reason coinbase prohibits their employees from trading BCH. Privileged information is a dangerous thing.

Because people do not sell at the last traded price, but rather a lower price due to high sell pressure.
Say you want to sell 100 bitcoins at $15000. The chances are someone is gonna try get their coins sold before all yours and they will post a $14999 price instead to undercut you. If the buy pressure is high, it would not be a problem, people would buy the $14999 coin, your $15000 coins and keep going up until they fulfilled their orders, thus raising the price.
But if the buy pressure is low, then those at $14999 aren't being sold, your coins at $15000 is definitely not being sold and the order just stays there, opening up in time for people to start posting $14998, $14997 or $14996 bids. 
People buy the lowest $14996 and the price is set to that. Your 100 coins is now worth less and you get more and more reasons to post below market price of $14996 if you are willing to make sure your coins are sold before the price drops any further, so you start selling at $14995 to undercut everyone else. Now the price is $14995, down from $15000. 
Other reasons of undercutting the price is because you want to sell fast and be sure your supply gets sold, for example when you are day trading and want to end for the day.
TL;DR If Demand is low, time allows for new lower bids to come in before current supply at a price is sold out, constantly lowering the price of a coin.

I generally dont talk to people how much my bank account or investments are at all. So don't know why I would tell them about any bitcoin investments either.
You can still participate in the discussion about Bitcoin as someone simply tech-savvy/informed without revealing commitment. Bitcoin adaption is gonna be fine without your co-workers. If you really wanna help them out, just reveal you are thinking of investing in Bitcoin and tell them why. If they are truly interested, they will look it up themselves.
They should not base their decision to invest based on the amount of other people like yourself are investing anyway. That's a bad FOMO approach.

You can't, ether simply doesn't follow this line or trend at all at the moment. I believe Ether best follows standard linear regression, which predicted a $500 price at end of 2017 at the start of the year, which seems to be pretty accurate.
But in the end its all guesses and estimates and no one knows.

It counts whenever the sale/buy was made, which is easily checked cause there is a ledger that records every single transaction of Bitcoin.

Absolutely, sales/buys orders all range from 0.00001 to 100 BTC. As for finding buyers, BTC trading volume is many billions every day.
If you look here you can see most sells/buys are not even close to being a full BTC:

He probably means the 82% drop over 2 years. Bitcoin hit $1100 in Nov 2013 after going up from 200, slowly dwindled to back to $200 in 2015 and did not return to $1000 until Early 2017 I believe.
But he makes it sound more dramatic than it is I suppose.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:26:04
It duplicates the ledger, so there is two coins. It's still 925 + 6000 or 6000 + 925 assuming prices stays the same, which they wont of course
Your private key will  work on both chains, so you own both coins, assuming you own Bitcoin whenever the fork happens or happened. I believe coinbase simply gives you both coins.
Im 98% sure of this Answer, maybe less, maybe more.

Of course? Bitcoin is fractional in every way. You can buy a coffee with 0.0001 bitcoin if you so like, even if the several dollar fee wouldn't really be worth it for coffee at the moment.

Correct, it is called capital GAINS tax, it comes in effect when you sell or use the asset to buy something and made a profit. Then you have a % of profit tax to pay, the amount varies from 0% to 40% of profits depending on country and tax bracket, but commonly 15-30%
*Example*: You buy $100 worth of Bitcoin and HODL it until it is worth $1000. No tax is yet to be collected.
You then buy something for $200, paying with bitcoin, now there is a tax to be paid. You bought these $200 at $20, so $180 profit is to be taxed, at 15%, that would be $27 worth of tax.
You now have $800 left and decide to cash out all of it. You bought these for $80, so you made a $720 profit, with a 15% Capital gains tax, you are expected to pay $108 in tax.
All in all, your $100 investment is after tax is worth $865 and has yielded you $765 in profit.
If you held your $1000 and sold it all at once, profit would be 900, tax would be 135 (15%) and final profit after taxation would be still be $765.
Different countries have different rules, tax brackets and all that, so check with your local tax agency to find out what your tax would be, unless you practice tax evasion in a system where every transaction is recorded forever, which sounds risky. If you are busted at a later date, you might have to pay penalty fees and similar for not declaring your taxes sooner depending on countries.

Your first problem is asking that in a extremely biased place like r/bitcoin. Do you need someone to blame if it turns out it loses you money?
Do you think bitcoin will rise in price and is the future? Then probably consider getting in.
Do you think bitcoin is a huge fraud and will crash and burn? Then buying it would be a bad move.
But honestly no one knows more than you do, there's extreme predictions of both ways happening, from $2 million valuation to crash and burn.
In the end it's your money, your decision and your consequences to handle.

Is every event taxable? I think this is a question that pops up a lot and seems to have some confusion on it.
• Selling Bitcoin and Buy an altcoin     
• Selling Bitcoin and later buy back Bitcoin, only keeping money in exchange and never "cashing out"     
• Buy altcoin using bitcoin profits    
• Buying something else with bitcoin profits    
In my mind all of these above are taxed. Am I thinking correctly?

I did mean the act of trying to not spend your initial investment and only spend "profit" as some people try to do. But yeah, I meant buying something directly with bitcoin. My bad for using the word "profit" when the amount of BTC hasn't increased, just the value of it.
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:47:04
If you make profits from selling something like a stock or commodity then the profit is in many countries taxed. I think it's usually called capital gains tax and yes it would apply when you buy stuff with bitcoin profit. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:56:31
Would require some really heavy selling and I'm not sure what would trigger that. People already seen it dip to 5100ish and return back up, which causes people to buy in at such amounts if they would appear again making the drop below 5 even tougher.
But if some "bad" news or events occur, of course it could happen. But would be impossible to predict that. Question is if the fork won't boost it the other way when people sell their 2x and put it back into btc.

That's the sound strategy, which people used when it hit $105 something all-time high. 
They regret it that they sold probably. 
That's why people buy when it's high, they expect/hope it will go higher. You can always say it will dip and you will buy when it does. Like people did on 4800ish ATH. Instead it went up to 5800.
It's a tricky business with plenty of depth.

First of all, there is usually checks against insane differences in ask price to prevent market manipulation.
Second of all, it should sell the lowest ask first, in order for the 100,000 to be fulfilled, the buy order has to be big enough to buy every coin below $100,000 as well before it buys the $100,000 coin and then sets the price to $100,000.
At least that is my understanding. Im happy to be corrected as I am still learning.

I don't think Bitcoin will ever replace fiat, but that it's more likely that it replaces gold, so we go back to an fiat backed by something, but instead of the old days of being backed by gold, it will be backed by BTC.

Futures is basically agreeing on a price and a date for a product. For example say I offer you $6000 for Bitcoin every day for a month.
Every day the score is settled, as long as bitcoin is below 6k, I would lose money and have to pay you the deficit, but if it goes above 6k, you would be losing money because you would have to pay me any amount above 6k for that day. No actual bitcoins are moved AFAIK and unlike regular trading it is settled daily and not when it's sold.
It is simply put the opposite of a short position.

You would definitely need some kind of way to launder the bitcoins. But with these amounts and for transactions that are so heavily traced and followed it would be very hard indeed to cash out the majority of it. You could probably sell parts of it outside the web to maximize the anonymity, but there would still be a receiver address and a person that met up with you, creating a trace.
Either that or just sell it all and use the cash to disappear.

You sell high and wait for it to go down in price to buy in again, giving you the same amount of btc, but with a profit.
Now of course if the price just keeps going up after you sell, you could end up having to buy in for more than you sold for in fear of missing out.
