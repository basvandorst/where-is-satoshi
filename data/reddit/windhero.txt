Generally foreign governments that pay more do so because it is being paid in a currency with higher inflation. Japan, European countries debt yield even less than US and they have less inflation.
So you might get a better yield but your position in foreign currency will depreciate because of inflation. You can't get high return without risk.

Dude that's like 8% interest. Current 10 year treasury bond yields are Government notes pay 2.38%.

Yeah the whole point of bitcoin is to quickly double your money by buying from someone who quickly doubled their money and then selling to someone who hopes to quickly double their money.

No people buy shares of Apple because that entitles them to the future profits of Apple. Yes you may sell that later to someone else but you can also hold it and receive the profits when they are distributed. That makes all the difference. The only way to make money on buying Bitcoin however is to sell it for more to someone else for a higher price. It's pure speculation.

Apple makes profits that can actually be eventually paid out to shareholders. Otherwise without profits I agree with you the stock market would just be a ponzi.

Lol you have no clue what you are talking about do you? Even if a stock doesn't pay dividend it still has value because it has the ability to earn profits and to pay out shareholders via dividends, stock buybacks or even liquidation. Business and property ownership, including stocks, is by far the single greatest source of wealth creation in the world right now. It clearly beats inflation. Because it generates profits for the owners. Just look at literally all the rich people in the world. Business ownership is fundamentally different from owning a currency that doesn't entitle you to anything.

Cold hard truth right there. Think of all the cash flows of bitcoin so far: early adopters taking payments from new converts who all think they will become millionaires by selling out at a higher price to more people later on. What does this sounds like?

No. At maturity, the price has to converge. This is by design of the future contract. The future contract will settle at maturity based on the spot price at the time of maturity.

Yes but arbitrageurs would have to find a way to short sell actual bitcoins... which might be difficult to do. I'm not to familiar with the bitcoin trading landscape.

This community sounds like a bunch of losers pumping a pyramid scheme.
"Buy coins now and you will become a millionaire when someone else will buy them from you for much more money in the future hoping to become a millionaire by selling it to someone for even more money. This has never been tried before! It's guaranteed that we will all be rich!"
Jamie Dimon is right. Sure a bunch of people will make a ton of money with bitcoin, but a bunch of suckers will lose the same amount. It's a zero sum game. Every profit will be a loss for someone else.

Even in a high inflation environment, owning gold just preserves your wealth. As an investor you are much better owning businesses or property that generate profits / income that will also increase with inflation.
Bitcoin is just a riskier/worse version of gold because gold at least has some usability that ensures that it will stick around. Sure bitcoin can continue to rise faster than inflation as it becomes more popular over time. But there is no limit on how the bitcoin scheme can be copied (even with improvements). Inevitably, because of human psychology, bitcoin will collapse as the "hot money" moves to the new fad of the day. Maybe just another slightly better crypto-currency.
No serious investor should hold/invest in fiat over long periods of time either. Their is no value in currency. True value is owning a business, property, having the ability to tax, having the ability to do something that you can get paid for, or at least owning a commodity that other people value. The currency that you use to trade your goods and services doesn't actually matter.

Yes it is a separate market. But it is still linked. If a bunch of people want to buy bitcoin futures, the future price of bitcoin goes up on the CME. As soon as there is a large enough difference between the spot price and the future price, arbitrageurs will come in and will sell futures, borrow USD and buy actual bitcoins. This creates a risk free trade that earns them money as long as the price differential between future and spot BTC is enough to cover the cost of borrowing the funds.
All this to say that buying volume on the futures market will translate to the actual BTC market and vice versa. Trading futures might just be an easier way to speculate on bitcoin.

Good point, you should sell your bitcoins and buy real estate.

I know more about finance and less about tech so I can't speak that much for the bitcoin network but my understanding is that the costs / volume / delay issues would certainly make things complicated.
 You could have a situation where the futures become out of sync with the actual bitcoin market but due to cost / delays / liquidity problems you can't arbitrage it.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:51:34
Not because of the price forecast. Because you can make a risk free trade if there is a disconnect between the current spot price of bitcoin and the future price.
As you say, the future price is only determined by traders on futures. So if a bunch of people want to buy futures and no one wants to sell, the price of the future will go up, regardless of the price of bitcoin.
In that situation, an arbitrageur can borrow money, buy bitcoin and sell bitcoin futures. Then you just wait until the future contracts comes to maturity at which point the future contract will settle at a price equal to the price of your bitcoins. Either your bitcoins will have gone up, or the future price (which you have sold) will have come down. You make a profit in every scenario, as long as the payoff is greater than the cost of borrowing the money.
So because of that arbitrage opportunity, buying pressure on futures will end up creating buying pressure on bitcoin itself.

Worried about money laundering
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:16:11
If you have a million dollars worth of bitcoins, you have to show how you earned that million dollar. If you claim you bought early and became rich, you have to prove it. Otherwise it could be $1 million of drug money that you are just trying to launder through Bitcoin.
