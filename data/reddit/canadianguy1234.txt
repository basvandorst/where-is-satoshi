plus it's also kinda skewed because such a disproportional amount of bitcoin is held by so few
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:16:59
It would be nothing for me to retire on, but it would be a nice vacation for sure.  
  
And it would be even sweeter if my altcoins keep the same exchange rate to bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:43:12
too right shibe

"This is good for bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:03:53
have they not already?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:29:33
dogecoin best coin.  
  
It's a joke coin and the most serious coin at the same time. And it's going to the moon!
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:08:03
I thought the same thing until I bought bitcoin at 10k
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:06:26
to be honest I don't really know why normal bitcoin has any value at all
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:03:28
I think he's serious. Going from dollars to bitcoins back to dollars gets rid of the transfer fee from person A to person B.
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:17:44
well, I don't know everything about this, but let's say you wanted to send someone $100. If you sent it through a bank, there would be lots of other fees, as has been pointed out around here. So if you can transfer the $100 to bitcoin, then send the bitcoin to the recipient, and then they transfer it back to dollars, they should have almost the full $100.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:00:12
how is anything I said fear, uncertainty, or doubt?
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:34:48
I bought a few tenths in 2014 for 200 canadian dollars and immediately converted them to an alt coin. I now no longer have the passcode for the wallet and it's all gone :)
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:40:11
believe me, the "what could have been" can be really shitty too (although I realize you don't need me to tell you this since you already know how it feels)  
  
When I just think about how much money I could have if I bought bitcoin when I knew about it and was tempted, it drives me insane
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:37:56
just realized I can't even sell the bitcoins on coinbase in Canada... this just got a bit more complicated. Do you know of another site where I might be able to?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:14:59
does gdax work in Canada?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:55:05
I vaguely know about the technology, and I was a huge believer in crypto during the first peak around 2013-14 but I also remember how in 2014-2016 it seemed like it was just an old fad 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:51:15
Do you know how I would get into something like that? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:13:10
"an error has occurred" lmao
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:58:33


please, god, I don't want this valueless currency on my computer any more, it's taking up too much space. I'll pay you to take it from me
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:05:31
there are too many ways to buy lol. Anything special about GDAX I should know before using it?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:22:35
I hope you're right. fuck, why won't bitcoin crash for a couple days? It feels so wrong to be buying in after a year straight of growth considering it's been so stagnant before that.  
  
What made bitcoin suddenly take off?
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:38:12
shit. I had a similar experience but this is WAY worse. I lost the password for my doge wallet, and I can't access $200 worth.   
  
If it's any consolation, you made me feel better about my misfortune :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:46:46
I would but coinbase is down
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:35:44
where did the publicity come from?  
 
I know there was a lot during the first "peak" in early 2014, yet it went back down 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:04:07
yeah probably. I'll be honest though, I think I'm kinda worried about losing anything I put in in some convoluted way. Like the computer crapping out or an exchange stealing it, or being charged ridiculous fees I never expected. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:34:45
yeah that's one thing that scares me about bitcoin. I recently lost the passphrase on an altcoin wallet that I had collecting dust for a few years. $200 down the drain and they can never be used by anyone. Eventually, due to stupid mistakes, a substantial amount of bitcoin has to be permanently lost. If someone stupidly drops a quarter into the ocean the government can just reprint the money, but if someone loses bitcoin, nothing can be done.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:56:36
back down to 10760 now
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:51:41
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:10
I wish i heard some of that media coverage lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:17:27
yes, because i don't know for sure that it will grow another 1000% 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:59:05
Methinks a certain person whose last name rhymes with "graphy" is invested in Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:52:44
smart. That way nobody will see it
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:56:15
lmao I bet if I don't buy we'll get there right away and if I do it'll crash. Probably best for everyone if I stay out
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:28:14
Still waiting for the crash. I'm pretty risk averse, so I'm not buying in until I see true despair on this sub. I'm talking "I put my kid's college fund into bitcoin, now what" despair. I've seen it before. If it doesn't happen then so be it, I lose out. But I'd rather feel dumb for missing an opportunity than feel dumb for losing money to magic internet coins
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:45:02
apparently BTC/USD trading is not available in my region on GDAX...
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:04:21
jesus christ, coinbase charges a 4% "convenience fee". What is this shit? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:04:45
I wish I was someone who could toss a thousand dollars around willy-nilly
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:54:09
alright! It just went from 11k to 10760! So far so good
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:12:14
oh cool
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:31
oh well, gotta be some way
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:39:24
you got it, bud!
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:52:38
yeah but theoretically eventually the entire supply will be lost, or it will get to a point where not enough is being sold to make it practical for transactions
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:21:02
doesn't it say it's just an over/under?
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:10:20
BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:49:29
how do I even get bitcoin as a non-tech savvy person? It can be confusing for people like me. And you don't want to be throwing money at something you hope is the right thing when you're confused about it
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:32:03
where's the logic saying that it isn't in a bubble?  It's been pumped up like 2500%. Why did this happen? I think people are going to cash out. I could be wrong and I know this. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:43:52
yes but I also happily accept bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:22:15
just looking at it from a risk-reward perspective right now, I feel like it the price could shoot up or down no matter what. I believe in bitcoin, but I think that we're in a bubble right now. I'm not going to wait until it goes down to $10 each, but I'm gonna wait it out a bit and if I miss out I miss out.  
  
I'm definitely more of a casual investor
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:51:24
exactly this. Not to mention I'm worried the computer I will put the coins in will crap out on me and then they're gone.
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:29:30
I was here 4 years ago, but I'll admit I wasn't really paying attention during the long &lt;$500 spell. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:25:46
Same here. Being able to sell is pretty big and this site and most others are us/euro centric
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:36:17
from where?
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:12:39
I have just about only good memories from that span of about a year
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:09:55
remindme! one week
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:36:13
nobody on this subreddit will tell you to wait. Both because they strongly believe in the future of bitcoin, and because they are all already invested themselves and the more people invest, the higher the price goes
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:20:35
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:40:40
how do you know?
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:30:41
Now I'm even more paranoid. Any way to make sure there isn't anything like that?
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:37:00
why? And if this is common knowledge, wouldn't the market adjust for this already?
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:16:23
also if it actually made it to 6k lol it's back down to 5940
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:43:35
yeah dogecoin! what a fun little community we were back in the day :)
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:35:51
Where's the logic in any of this? It just doesn't seem to be the right time to buy. You gotta buy low sell high and right now it seems like I would be buying high
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:23:54
It used to be the  crypto. And the community is, or at least used to be, amazing. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:22:45
be careful what you wish for ;)
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:50:15
no idea, but I was a part of the dogecoin community in 2014 and we did all sorts of things like this. We sponsored a nascar driver and we helped send the jamaican bobsled team to the olympics, among other things. The way it worked was we had a huge fundraiser and people just donated what they could, because we all wanted to see the jamaican dogesled team, or the doge racecar in action. The funds were managed by a trusted member of the community, they were exchanged for dollars and I don't know the technical details after that. It was a great time
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:47:33
where's doge?
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:31:03
Everyone's reading off of something. Once I realized it, it's ruined a lot of illusions
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:15:32
It would give you better returns to make this bet than to buy the bitcoins upfront. I guess because of the time nature of it.  
  
If you bet $100 and won, you'd get $165 whereas if you bought bitcoin at today's price with that $100 you would only get $130 assuming it just gets to the $7250 mark
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:56:37
I for one would like to know where you got your crystal ball
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:04:25
I'm waiting for a legit crash so I can buy any lol. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:33:53
Wish I did that. I'm sitting here with my dogecoins waiting for the next bubble
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:59:55
yeah I'm over here wishing I didn't miss out. At the same time though, I only had a few grand to invest and not afford to lose, so I wouldn't be a millionaire or anything. If I went all-in, I would have 2 million dollars tho
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:17:24
I'll buy it for you in a few hours. Just send me your banking info and I'll complete the transaction once bitcoin falls a bit more
