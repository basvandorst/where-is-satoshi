That's the whole point of Bcash dude. Trust miners! Adoption now! Moon now! Who cares about the future when you are rich? Other people gonna solve that problem. If shit hit the fan don't be the one holding bags and you will be a-okay.

It gives you 2 options of Segwit and Legacy when you first setup the wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:17:34
I disagree.
Bcash offers a permanent solution: just replace banks with miners and trust them 100%. Bcash can scale easily to any size.
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:17:36
Man with all the crap he's pushing on rbtc sometimes I think he works as a double agent! If Bcash implemented everything he suggest it would die faster.

It's a good thing. Bcashers chose their own fate. They will be an example for the following generations of crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:24:07
Bcash are flip flopping. Previously they were pushing Craig's 1GB narrative for 100% on-chain scaling.
They didn't think LN would go online this early, now they are panicking and trying to change the narrative, last year we have a ton of shills spreading FUD on LN, insulting the Core devs over and over again. Now suddenly Bcash is "not against layer 2".
They are fucking themselves over already, now a true Bitcoin supporter should spread Craig Wrong's message on rbtc to end their suffering earlier.
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:19:59
Lol of all the people they picked on Andreas. Bcash is desperate that LN gonna be here this year. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:44:21
They can't use LN as it is. Read the OP's link. 
LN is designed for frequent purchases like grocery or bus ticket, not 1 time casual shopping. We need LN payment companies for that kind of thing
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:30:22
It's here: 
They compare LN wallet to a hot wallet. Which is more similar to the personal wallet you carry everyday, rather than your bank account.
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:55:22
You think they have that many people? There are the same few guys making daily reminder that rbtc is being attacked.
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:34:08
Try  on twitter. They demonstrated LN successfully a few days ago. 
@_date: 2019-07-13 01:02:20
You wont. rbtc mods are employed by Ver.
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:31:38
If you are talking about Bcash, there are other reasons. Bcash is highly political, and they already vilified Segwit and LN, porting them over will damage it's brand.
For other shitcoins, most of them are not hardfork of Bitcoin. It's not easy to port LN over at all. You need to port Segwit over first. See how Garzik2X fucked up, and that was only a hard fork.
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:08:30
Because you need competent developers to port the solution to your shitcoin.

Since exchanges began batching, tx volume is no longer an accurate reflection of activity. Check out  . All time high.
Beside LN there's also Blockstream's Liquid for off chain tx. But idk how well it's being used.

Before the bcash fork it was filled with butters as well. Not sure if they stay around tho.
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:07:36
They said they are implementing LN, but I don't hold my hope too high with their track record.
@_date: 2019-07-14 08:41:18
It is actually pretty easy for exchanges to implement LN due to their custodial nature. They can create and operate a LN wallet for you, similar to BluWallet's custodial option.

You cannot delete information from the internet. Anything you put up stay forever, and each mistake piles on another. Even real spies mess up their opsec, do you think you will do better than them?
Sharing personal information is a bad practice, don't make it into a habit.

Did the balance add up?
If Copay on another device doesn't work the only option left is to import your private keys to another wallet app.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:45:52
Try to browse your Copay addresses on blockexplorer, money should still be there. I know Copay is buggy af, got scared shitless by it myself for a good 30 minutes by a similar bug.
It does let you control your private key, export that and put it on Electrum. Or install Copay on another phone, restore the wallet and move the fund. 
PS: I recommend everyone to migrate away from Copay to Electrum or Ledger Nano S. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:27:42
Get some screenshot or error log for people to debug
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:28:37
Well that is bad :(Try to check the rest of the addresses to see if they add up.
Anyway the fastest attempt to fix you can do right now is to get another device, put Copay on it and try to import your old wallet to the new phone. Or use their [chrome app]( or desktop client

@_date: 2017-12-31 05:32:05
You don't trust anything. Fund transferred on LN also gets 1 signature from each party in the channel, same with normal btc transaction. They just get grouped together into 1 batch.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:17:35
Copay app -&gt; Setting -&gt; Click on your wallet -&gt; Scroll down -&gt; More options -&gt; Wallet Addresses 
You should see a bunch of unused addresses, and below them are "addresses with balance". These should show some money.
If all your money doesn't add up here, note down the unused addresses, then click on "view all addresses". Check each of these on blockexplorer (no need to check unused addresses you noted earlier)

The node count requirement boils down to Satoshi's SPV doesn't work as intended, eroding security (he left before implementing it). 
I'm not technical enough to understand why SPV doesn't work, but Bcash fails to provide decent explaination why it works as well. So I'm undecided in the blocksize debate, but leaning toward bigger block.
On the other hand I am very convinced that multi-layered approach like LN works (I have background in networking). Bcash's terrible arguments to smear layer 2 ended up convincing me to stay away from them.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:26:00
Gonna be the same with Wikileak getting banned by banks, they will be banned from these banks' lightning nodes too. Nothing can stop people from sending the money directly onchain, or route the payment throu other LN nodes to Wikileak. And by other nodes I mean nodes from ~~McDonald, Costco, Amazon, Steam~~ Taobao, IKEA, non American companies.

LN is designed for microtransaction, so there are incentives for merchants to setup huge LN nodes for themselves to serve their userbase. I don't see a problem with that.

If I understand it correctly, the bug allows a miner with significant hashrate to burn 12.5 BTC to crash all nodes connected to them.
So how does a blackhat hacker profit from this bug if it was not reported?
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:15:05
One benefit of Bitcoin is letting user and merchant **bypass** middlemen like Visa (they charge 2% fee I believe). Now with LN nodes merchant can set the fee by themselves, which is predictably be 0% or even negative fee as bonus. **And these nodes can be interconnected.**
Where is the place for Visa and Paypal in this future? I guess they can advertise themselves as a "convenience" wallet? 
Fractional reserve not possible with LN. You can't lock your coin on 2 different channels at the same time.

I already said I'm not informed enough about the SPV thing. I'm unconvinced by both sides of that issue, so I choose to believe that SPV works because Satoshi said so, not because I understand why it works.
That makes me a big blocker. But I find Bitcoin community and developers to be more rational, so I hold Bitcoin not Bcash.

It's the same with owning 100x $1 coin, or 10000x 1 cent.

Although I still believe in Satoshi's SPV being "safe enough", I agree very much about Bitcoin's direction toward optimization first. 
I'm too sold on LN to give priority to big blocksize right now. The idea of recording a coffee transaction publically forever is flat out stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:51:55
The thing is they don't even need LN. Bcash can easily fork 1GB block in 2 weeks, most of their nodes are in Alibaba datacenter anyway, no bandwidth or storage issue at all. 1 sat/byte transaction til the end of time!
Maybe Craig Wright is the real Satoshi working as a double agent! After all if Bcash implement all his ideas today it would just die quicker :) 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:58:00

They literally can't afford to hear it.
The very existence of Bcash depends on LN not working. They can't even implement it.
Bcash reached a dead end by using ETH's "move fast and break things" model. They bought into altcoins' sale pitch of blockchain 2.0, thinking those centralized shitcoins can actually dethrone the KING.

Bitcoin: layered approach. Limited but secure base layer, compromise upper layers for transaction throughput. 
Bcash: classic altcoin approach, compromise base layer for throughput. (note that Bcashers don't believe low node count is a compromise).
Pretty much every single internet protocol uses the layered approach. It's tried and true for much longer than the history of cryptocurrency.
I believe the blocksize can be increased right now, but Bcashers are not the people I want to implement changes.

You know what's funny?
**Bitcoin doesn't need Bitmain**. If Bitmain goes under, difficulty gonna drop and there will be even more incentive for new companies to get into mining. That's the power of Bitcoin, the ingenuity of Satoshi's design. Jihan arrogantly thought he can dictate the system, now he's punished for it.

"Secure" is not just about holding private key. 
I do tech support, and I've meet a fair share of people that I think will never be able to keep their private key safe. And that's not because they are unwilling to learn: some of my clients are 70+ with bad memory. To these people, a centralized, insured solution like bank is the only option. At least they can still get their money back in case they lost the piece of paper that has their password.
And not every country has shitty credit cards like America. Europe's debit cards are good, no cash back bullshit because the fee are low to begin with.

Holy shit you are so dense.
The average bitcoin transaction value is larger than 1 coin, or 3900$ in your wrong calculation. 
This can be calculated by anyone because all bitcoin onchain transactions are public. You can trust the number provided by blockchain analyzers or write a program and do it yourself. But I don't expect you to be capable of doing the later, so maybe ask other buttcoiners. So far you are the dumbest I've seen so there's a good chance you will learn something from them.

ETH is closer to Bcash than Bcash is to BTC. 
Both shitcoins' devs display radically high time preference. They are focus on the "pump now" and are willing to sacrifice the future for it. Look at what they achieved instead of what they market. Dapps usage close to zero, best use case being gateway for scamcoins, full nodes crumbling under their blockchain's weight.
ETH dies the moment a true killer dapp is born. That dapp either turns itself into a standalone token for mad gainz, or get cloned into Bitcoin's layer 2.
The only alt that I found with low time preference is Monero. And I don't own any Monero.

I argued that Bitcoin is the most liquid trustless asset, not the most liquid asset ever. 
Trustless asset cannot compete with fiat money in term of liquidity. Even the best trustless asset that is Bitcoin has a 10 minutes blocktime hard limit. 
So far we have 2 major consensus mechanisms in Bitcoin: on-chain transaction and LN network. Liquid will be the third one. Each of them was made with one specific goal that they do best. Coppola intentionally mix things together to spin her narrative. 
Bitcoin was not designed to serve high speed traders' arbitrage need. Traders want instantaneous confirmation, and that is exactly what Blockstream gave them. Remember, the act of trading on custodial exchanges is a forfeiture of your private key to begin with. Liquid is not a loss of trustlessness because there were none in trading.

Bitcoin has a publicly known set of rules. And everyone has to follow these rules including devs, miners and users. Anyone tring to break the rules are thrown out as [their version of reality get rejected by **the rest of the network**]( In fact this is a key feature of Bitcoin. So I think it's not wrong to say everyone is permitted **by the whole network** to participate, as long as they follow the rules.
The part of him being wrong is claming "It's no different than any other banking system in that sense". For Bitcoin it's not the devs and miners giving permission, it's the whole ecosystem making the decision. That's where it's different than a corporate bank.
Remember Bcashers getting kicked is a feature of Bitcoin. If the majority of the network had sided with them, they would have the right to propose changes to Bitcoin's rule set. But that didn't happen.

As much as I hate bcash, it doesn't work that way. 
Centralization IS security. Or to be precise, centralization is consistency. You can't 51% attack an excel sheet.
Both bcash and ethereum demonstrated this. They can simply fork off an attack and call their centralization a feature.

I would like to add a bit to 's second point: we don't need to write everything from the supplychain's database on Bitcoin blockchain. 
You use a regular database with activity auditing then calculate a CRC hash every 10 minutes and write it on Bitcoin with high tx fee. That's enough to tell whether our database was tampered with, and when. You can split the database into multiple parts and calculate CRC for each parts for finer tracking. The fee cost is negligible compared to the security provided by Bitcoin.
Traditional database is superior to supplychain in every aspect, except for the need of a trusted bookkeeper. Give your book to Bitcoin and problem solved.

A simulation was neccessary years ago, but not anymore. Today we have real data of what's happening to a chain with bigger blocksize: Ethereum. It processes roughly twice the amount of transactions that Bitcoin does daily. Vitalik could be considered one of the original "big blockers", and Ethereum is the "real" bcash. 
[And things aren't pretty for them]( Check out section 3.2








While this doesn't justify 's push for smaller blocksize, it does prove that bigger blocksize does not work for today's infrastructure.

It's been 2 years since Segwit activated. Look at the results: 
 - "Segwit anyone can spend": An obvious lie.
 - "Segwit is useless": Blocks have never been bigger. Daily tx counts are back at record level while 1 sat fee tx still get cleared.
 - "Flippening": Bcash reached it's lowest point in history in all metrics: lowest hash rate, lowest price, smallest blocksize. Flippened by fucking EOS. 
We could have had Segwit since 2015. Wasted 2 years of "civilized discussion" on trash like Peter Rizun or Roger Ver.

ETH has much lower block time. Bandwidth usage and block propagation are determined by size/time. Currently ETH processes only 2x of BTC's transaction capacity. 
It is a living example of how big block doesn't work, read these 2 articles:

For currency, there is Bitcoin. You really should read the whitepaper or a summary of it to understand the game theory of blockchain technology, proof of work and mining. 
For contract, there is Lightning network which ultilize [HTLC]( which is a form of smart contract. There is no proof of work and no miner, the final settlement is carried out on the Bitcoin blockchain. Essentially it's a law contract with Bitcoin system being both judge, jury and executioner. It's security and decentralization piggyback entirely on Bitcoin itself.
I have yet to seen a standalone smart contract blockchain that is useful. Same with voting.

Fiat processing is slow, and the amount of legal issue involves with fiat is not attracting either. 
Trading is gambling, and the only "sure win" gamble is arbitrage trade (betting on both sides). You need to move money very fast to snipe these opportunities. For example buying BTC at $3800 on Coinbase and sell at $3900 on Finex, then move USD back to Coinbase to repeat.

I used to hold both, but sold BCH 1 year ago when began promoting conman Craig Wright's contents. 
Limited transactions capacity is one of the biggest weak points for Bitcoin, since Bitcoin doesn't sacrifice decentralization for capacity.

Deploying checkpoints exposes their chain to risk of splitting: when an attacker secretly mine a 10 blocks chain and release it to half of the network, their blockchain get split it half and immediately lock in to each half's longest chain. 
Half will have the attacker's blocks as the longest chain while the other half has the normal blocks as longest.
The reason nobody did this is because they can't make profit from doing this (exchanges require 20 blocks confirmation for bcash anyway). And the split can be manually fixed at no cost since bcash is utterly centralized, same reason nobody attacks Ripple.

Appealing to authority is a lost cause for bcash. 
Who does Bitcoin BTC have on it's side? Adam Back has his work cited in the whitepaper. Nick Szabo who created the term "smart contract". Or Bram Cohen, author of the BitTorrent protocol, I assume he qualifies as an expert with decentralized systems. 
And who does bcash have? Conman Craig . Roger "saleman" Ver . Gavin "Craig is Satoshi" Andersen . Jeff "off by one" Garzik.
It's not even fair for bcash. You never see Ver inviting people like Andreas A. or Nick Szabo to a debate, because they would murder him in cold blood.

You should keep your coins in private wallet before the fork happen. 
 - Scenario1: Jeff caves in and add replay protection, which means air drop for you. 
 - Scenario2: No preplay protection, chaos follows. Best action is still to hold and wait til the dust settle.
And move your coin in advance, in case everyone rushes on the last days and congest the network.

- Read on the ETH classic fork. Their developers have the power to roll back literally **any transaction**. 
- Check out [this thread]( the very first result from googling "ethereum full node sync". [See how ETH blocksize grow]( and remember ETH is only 2 years old.
However this is not a problem for ETH since decentralization is not a priority for them.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:38:02
Changing block size requires a hardfork. The argument is you should bundle hardfork with as much bug fix as possible, this takes time. And Segwit just activated not long ago, the best thing to do is to wait for higher adoption and see if any bug show up. 
"Feel" is not an argument. You can't future proof the blockchain with S2X since it's a linear increase, once fee drop there will be people spamming.

@_date: 2017-09-08 20:08:59
Here's my theory on these series of news from Japan:
 - All the shitstorm going on with Bitcoin in the last few months are all connected to China. Especially the threat of Jihan's mining cartel keeps getting bigger.
 - Japan is on the move to mass adopt Bitcoin. But given the bloody history of the two countries, **things won't end well for Japan if China manage to gain control** (for example holding hostage with hash rate)
So, to me, it seems like Japan decided to take matter into their own hands, even with a disadvantage (they'll never have electricity as cheap as China). These farms could defend Japan's crypto market against their big neighbor if shit really hits the fan.

That sub degraded over time. It had less bitcoin bashing during the prime time of bcash when it freshly forked and appeared to be a contender (bcash hashrate almost reached 50% at some point). 
Overtime the bitcoin economy rejected their idea, and bcash has been free falling in all measurable metrics: hashrate, price, transaction count, the already small community even split itself into another abomination that is BSV. 
Everything about bcash is all time low. When you have literally nothing positive to cheer on, I guess hatred and jealousy will take their courses.

If you got in this early enough you will know that bitcoiners didn't start the shit talk battle. 
Ethereum was the original big block chain, the original bcash, the original shit talker. They just shifted their sale pitches so quickly to trick newcomers. From "world computer" to "code is law" to the current "defi". ETH even have unlimited blocksize before bcash. Look how that work out for them.
They don't come up with good ideas at all. They came up with dog shit ideas, get shot down by bitcoiners, proceeded to put dog shit ideas into ETH while calling bitcoiners "toxic maximalists", and later moving to other dog shit ideas when their old dog shit ideas revealed themselves as dog shit.

The way I understand it, capitalism started out when humanity was still using hard, un-inflatable money. During this period of time western countries accumulated wealth through colonialism and trading. And this massive amount of accumulated capital is what made industrialization possible, propelling the West over the East as the leader of the world (communist countries failed to industrialize because they had no capital to start with). 
Then comes the World Wars, and the need to inflate currency to fuel war efforts ([this is not a new thing]( And the consequences of inflation is people saving less, spending more. It is the opposite of capital accumulation, the opposite of what made these countries successful.

**19 . "Hyperinflation is a form of economic disaster unique to government money. There was never an example of hyperinflation with economies that operated a gold or silver standard"**

the currency, and those who receive it earliest. This is termed the Cantillon

42 . “With unsound money, only returns that are higher than the rate of depreciation of the currency will be positive in real terms, creating incentives for high-return but high-risk investment and spending”

47 . “It is an ironic sign of the depth of modern-day economic ignorance fomented by Keynesian economics that capitalism - an economic system based on capital accumulation from saving - is blamed for unleashing conspicuous consumption - the
exact opposite of capital accumulation”

While I don't believe in Luke's 300kb proposal, I am certain 10x capacity does not work today. And I have proof for that.
Bcash choked at 4MB during stress test. Ethereum got choked by cryptokitties at the peak of 3x Bitcoin pre-segwit capacity. And Ethereum is already centralized to the point that their own dapp developers complain about the ability to get a node running:  (Section 3.2)

If cryptography no longer works then the price of Bitcoin is the last of our worry

On paper a switch to bcash is a net gain for Veriblock. With 5% hash rate they turn a profit if fee is 20 times lower. 
However nobody has time to wait 200 minutes (3+ hours) to achieve the security equivalent of 1 single bitcoin block. 
Bcash is a dead end.
@_date: 2019-05-08 09:58:18
You need more than 51% because the attack happened quite sometime ago, only 51% will take too long to catch up. The longer Binance let the original chain (with stolen fund) builds on itself, the harder it is to attempt a reorg.

 - The very first thing you need to do right now is to check whether you got Bitcoin BTC, the real deal, not bcash (BCH).
Bitcoin dot com promotes bcash as the "real" Bitcoin (it is not). The real Bitcoin is called "Bitcoin Core" on that site.
 - The second thing is to move your coins to a non-custodial wallet. I use electrum.org software wallet for small change and a Ledger Nano S for my main stash.
@_date: 2019-05-15 05:48:47
I don't think Bitcoin is fit to be the absolute king in it's current state, but most coins are outright scam, ETH in particular.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:57:44
We also know ETH got choked by cryptokitties, and at it's very peak it could only process 3x the amount of BTC's transaction capacity before segwit.
Unfortunately scams like ETH and BCH are not going away easily :(
@_date: 2019-05-27 09:31:40
Safe in the sense that nobody can spend your coins without the private key. But people can beat you up with a $5 wrench for that private key if they find out you are GODDAMN RICH.

Bcash is not the first attempt for cramming bullshit on a blockchain. Vitalik came up with the idea way before bcash, and was shot down by Bitcoin devs. Ethereum is the original bcash.
This is a great explanation from Peter Todd about the Ethereum scam:  27:16

One with a marketing team bigger than the dev team. Bcash, tron for example.
One that works better with an Amazon server or can't work without trusted third party. Storage, cloud computing, anything that needs an oracle
Etherum is it's own category of shit.

I call ETH and BCH scams by definition. Both employ false marketing to mislead people: "world computer" from ETH and "easy scaling" from BCH. Both slandered Bitcoin in their scam attempts. 
ETH is not a different project with different goal. It is the exact same big blocker scam, like BCH.
@_date: 2019-05-02 17:23:10
Bitcoin is not that good as fiat money in the digital currency aspect. It's closer to a bank wire than Paypal. 
My first Bitcoin was salary from a freelance job. Bitcoin and bank wire are much safer at that task, compared to Paypal which can be charged back later. And bankwire costs me 40-80$ for each transaction.
But if you want the currency aspect, almost nobody takes Bitcoin as a payment, just like no vendor takes bank wire as a payment option. 
Lightning network was created to compete with Paypal, it's not popular yet but there's a good chance Square will be the first major tech company to bring it mainstream in their Cash app.
TLDR: Bitcoin is not ready to be used like Wechat payment for coffee. Need layer 2 protocol for that.

Peter Todd explained this very well in his podcast:  27:15
"A bed of lies".
IMO it's similar to the alternative medicine scam: essential oils, chiropractic. They take something with real but vague functions and blow it out of the water with marketing. When it gets called out they immediately switch to new buzzwords. Eventually it takes too much effort to call out the scam and people give up.

Sorry but no. Bcash has nothing to do with the bear market, it's just a random shitcoin like any other shitcoin. 
It certainly **tried** to market itself as something that matters, but the fact is real people don't care enough. Bcash daily tx count is the most obvious sign. 
If anything Bcashers are enjoying the "decoupling" and "flippening" that they yearned for. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:19:51
That is a legitimate concern.
ETH for example is choking under it's own weight: [full validation is 5x longer in Oct than in Feb]( 5x in just 8 months, during a bear market no less. Too bad it's price doesn't go parabolic ;)

Most of you guys don't need Bitcoin that much for it's intended purpose. 
Who actually need Bitcoin: people in Venezuela getting screwed by their government, a freelancer in India getting robbed by Paypal, or a Vietnamese expat trying to send money home to her family.  I guess the Silk Road guys also fit in this category...

Luke has stats about blocksize growth, and number of full node count on his site. Check out the video of him giving presentation today.
His argument: blocksize is growing faster than hardware improvement rate over the past decade. And node count does not grow. Hence the 300kb suggestion.
I did not delve deeper into his math because I don't think that 300kb proposal will ever be considered at all.
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:37:09
bcash price, like other shitcoins, is not related to it's actual security. Nobody is in the shitcoin scene for the tech. And you don't need security to trade.
btc.com can fall back to mining Bitcoin at any time if bcash fail. They however cannot fall back to bcash if they decide to attack Bitcoin. 51% attack was mentioned in the whitepaper, and it's a lose-lose situation for miners by design.

Centralized at the equivalent of 3 MB blocks. Which is during the time Ethereum got choked by cryptokitties, it was processing about 3 times the capacity of BTC at 1 MB without Segwit.
This is an Ethereum dapps devs survey: 
Read what they say about the **current state** of ETH network at Section 3.2








That's the current state which is processing way less transactions than their cryptokitties peak. Said by dapps devs themselves not BTC maximalists.
Another commenter pointed out that bcash choked at 4MB during stress test.
Therefore I conclude Bitcoin's 1.7MB capacity with Segwit is a good limit.
