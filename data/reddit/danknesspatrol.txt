I'm talking about selling btc futures contracts next week having already stockpiled btc, then dumping all the btc on gemini driving the price down and creating a panic. Shorting btc has existed for a while, but nothing remotely similar to the volume of a futures market, and its been largely inaccessible to big institutions.

working perfectly now. thank you. will let you know if i encounter any other bugs. also, what source are you using? do you scrape from exchanges directly or from an external site or from the exchanges twitter? Thanks again for making this

Ok thanks. It is working but I get 4 texts every time there's an alert. Probably because I subscribed 4 times. How should I fix this? Unsubscribe and resubscribe? Maybe you should consider adding something that limits you to max 1  subscribe per phone number or something? Thank you, and this is a great service that you have created!

Yeah I've gotten burned trying to time markets, it really isn't worth it. Just dollar cost average, hold and chill.

I'm just hodling because I never have any clue what's going to happen in the short term, but I truly believe in btc and think it will be worth well over 100k (not that you'd want to convert btc to USD at that point anyway). I have no idea if the theory I presented will happen. I really just want to understand what would prevent that manipulation from occuring.

added a ton from 13800 to 14600. see you guys at 50k
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:54:12
This seems plausible, but I also think it becomes more difficult to manipulate as the overall market cap grows. It's so much harder to dump a lot of btc and drive the price down when the market cap is 1 trillion vs 250 billion. I could see it being a viable strategy to sell futures contracts, dump btc and drive the price down, then buy futures contracts and buy tons of btc at cheaper prices

ill eat my own dick if btc doesn't have 2x the market cap of any other crypto on 1/1/2022
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:00:53
Yeah I agree with this. I think holding btc long term and just ignoring any potential manipulation will be a very profitable strategy. I'm considering selling futures contracts to hedge my btc holdings short term since it's become an uncomfortable portion of my net worth, but I really don't want to sell any btc

Thanks for making this. just tried it out with my phone number and replied Yes but verification didnt go through.

let's play tummy sticks
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:50:16
I agree with this generally, and think that there's a reason a lot of banks/institutions are against a futures market being created. It adds a level of legitimacy, since after all there was never a futures market for tulip bulbs or whatever other stupid analogies people make. But I still don't really know what would prevent this short term manipulation from occurring. Hoping someone who trades futures can explain what measures are in place to stop this type of stuff from happening.

yes I understand CME Group is offering the contracts, but I need to find a broker that is actually allowing me to trade them. I've gone down the list of CME brokers and they are all taking a "wait and see approach"

nano s ledger already had this. imo it's significantly danker than trezor, although if you already have a trezor I understand not getting one.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:33:54
obviously this was going to happen because miners are choosing bitcoin over gold

avg inflation is 3.22% so the purchasing power of $100 after n years is just 100(1+.0322)^-n= 100/1.0322^n so using n=20 we get $53 and using n=10 we get $73. so assuming average and constant inflation rate $100 will have purchasing power of $73 in 10 years

@_date: 2017-09-02 16:53:45
well it isn't quite linear but yeah pretty much
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:06:42
Maybe you are right. I have no idea. I don't really believe in technical analysis. My strategy is to buy as much as I can afford to buy at all times.
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:47:05
assuming average inflation rates, purchasing power decreases roughly 50% every 20 years. so in 10 years if my bitcoins are worth 100k maybe I won't be completely broke? idk math is hard
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:06:21
it's crazy how many people listen to this fool. last time he spoke about btc price dropped almost immediately. can't wait to buy the dip. lol at people dollar cost averaging and not exploiting super obvious psychologically induced inefficiencies in teh crypto market 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:07:03
this is faulty logic. by ur reasoning u should never buy. for any given price X theres a very small probability that X is the all time low, so you might as well wait to buy at price X-$.01.
