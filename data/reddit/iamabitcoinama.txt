The idea with the club is that less (edit: fewer? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  ) than one million people can own at least 21 BTC.

bitquick.co, I've done four purchases through them, no ID needed. They hold the seller's bitcoin in escrow, you deposit money in the seller's account, they transfer the bitcoin to you.

I bought some bitcoin Monday in the middle of the stress test and the transaction went through just like usual. Maybe I got lucky.

I don't know why they would be missing so long, but eventually they will propagate to all nodes and won't be missing anymore.
Edit: Actually, they were just missing from TradeBlock, blockchain.info has them.

Larger block size means more transactions can be accommodated. It wouldn't cause more bitcoin to be created. Why would you think it would cause bitcoin price to drop/cause inflation?

Blocks 362077-362079 are currently missing, when they turn up some of these unconfirmed transactions will probably be found in those blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:54:22
And OP shouldn't worry about the old transaction, as once the new one goes through, the old one will never get processed anyway because it will be considered invalid.

Numbers are not stored as characters, they are stored in a more efficient datatype. Integers from zero up to 2^32 (a little more than four billion) can be stored with four bytes. There is a similar special data type for floating-point numbers (those which have a decimal point in them).
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:57:52
Sorry for the late reply. They've been around more than a year, from what I can tell. They have customer service, but I've never needed to contact them. Try it with a small amount and if it works, go bigger. I don't expect you'll have any problems though.
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:25:30
I've used bitquick.co twice now. Seller deposits the bitcoin in escrow with the company, you deposit cash in the seller's bank account, bitquick.co transfers the bitcoin to your address. Once the bank teller asked for my ID, once he didn't. Next time I'm going to try to tell them I don't want to present my ID, to see what the bank teller says. Anyway, it's fast and you don't have to be subject to the whole "know your customer" stuff you get with the big players.
Fee is 2%, paid by the buyer.

It's happening because the miners need to change something besides the nonce to hash on, so since the block time is in the header, they increment the time and then go through all the combinations of nonces again in their eternal search for the golden hash.

Make sure your LinkedIn profile is 100% up to date with both Bitcoin and finance information, and get your LinkedIn network to endorse you for those skills. Then companies which are looking for that expertise may contact you.
Other than that, keep an eye out for positions available advertisements. For example, Nasdaq announced they will be using the block chain to store private stock transactions. Maybe they will be hiring.
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:59:22
Just to be clear, NASDAQ is not going to use the blockchain for publicly traded stocks, at least not yet. The recent announcement has to do with privately held companies that have shareholders, who use NASDAQ to clear private trades.

The nonce is a 32-bit number, which allows for 2^32 or 4.29 billion tries for a given block header. But it now takes, on average, more than 200 quintillion attempts to successfully solve the proof of work, according to Wikipedia. Therefore the nonce field in the block header is insufficient for the purpose it was created, and miners have to find other things in the header to change.
Artificial block time changes would not be necessary if miners were limited to 4.29 billion hash calculations per second, but the market leader appears to be able to generate [6 terahashes per second]( (or six trillion hashes per second, to use similar units) which means it has tried all the nonces within one millisecond.

I've bought twice through bitquick.co. They don't verify your identity, so there's no three-day waiting period.
The seller puts the bitcoin in escrow with bitquick.co. The buyer transfers the money to the seller's designated bank account (in the U.S., that means going to the bank in person and depositing cash). You upload your proof of deposit to bitquick.co, and they initiate the bitcoin transaction minus 2% to cover the bitcoin fees and for their service.
I am not affiliated with bitquick.co in any way, I am just a satisfied customer planning to make more purchases through them.

@_date: 2016-06-06 21:30:10
Your situation seems like a natural for cash transactions. You have to take time out of your day to handle the transaction, but you don't need anything other than your ID. I've used cash to buy bitcoin from localbitcoin and from bitquick.co. The latter site just got back up and running after a lengthy period of downtime. I buy in the U.S. but as far as I know, both sites also operate in Europe.

How to beat the so-called "attackers" at their own game:
* Buy bitcoin

@_date: 2016-06-22 21:57:33
Before this week, we had demand from the following sources:
* Chinese nationals buying as a safe haven
* The impending halvening attracting speculation
* Safe haven investing due to the British polling pointing toward a brexit
More recent polls indicate a brexit is less likely, so that takes some of the demand off the table. The price slide may be self-reinforcing by causing some scaredy-cat speculators to get out. This is a short-term shakeout and I will buy if it continues to drop. In the long term, Bitcoin will be just fine.

What separates Bitcoin is that governments can make it more complicated to buy it, but they won't be able to completely outlaw it. So yes, it may be problematic from a price standpoint (temporarily) if the Chinese government were to crack down, but the genie is out of the bottle and their government will never be able to put it back in. And more importantly than price, from a human rights standpoint, the Chinese people will have some access to asset freedom.

First, good on you to run a full node.
Second, your issue is probably with permissions, check to see if the user the Bitcoin software is running as has write permission to that location.
Third, once you solve this, I'm pretty sure you will find that the Raspberry Pi 2 isn't fast enough. You will get 50-75% of the way to syncing up with the blockchain and then it will not ever finish. The issue is not enough physical memory to be able to manipulate the blockchain database in memory.
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:19:38
The odds of scoring bitcoin mining with a Raspberry Pi are about the same as winning the lottery.
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:24:55
If node 8333 is open, there is a good chance there is a Bitcoin wallet along with the node there. So this might give your customer a target to investigate more closely looking for vulnerabilities.

You upload your proof of deposit to bitquick.co, and they initiate the bitcoin transaction minus 2% to cover the bitcoin fees and for their service.
The reason why I use this company is because the bitcoin I buy is not tied to my identity, so the government does not have a record of the purchase. I believe this is what you're looking for, also.

To recover from a 50% revenue drop requires a doubling of the price of Bitcoin. A 50% price increase only gets you halfway there.

Open-source software, such as Bitcoin, is numbered differently from proprietary software. This article gets the gist of it right:
["The free-software community tends to use version 1.0 as a major milestone, indicating that the software is "complete", that it has all major features, and is considered reliable enough for general release."](
To this I would add that open-source software developers (and I would consider myself to be a minor member of that community) view everything they do as a work in progress, and going to Version 1 on anything is a huge decision not to be taken lightly. There is an element of hubris, as well, in releasing Version 1.
In Bitcoin's case, I would consider the current product to be functional, but we're still observing to see how it operates. There are always surprises and in particular, the mining market is still developing.
I would not presume to understand Nakamoto's thinking; I'm just providing a rationale for the current numbering approach.
@_date: 2016-07-05 14:45:10
The difficulty target adjustment, occurring every two weeks, guarantees the next halvening will occur very close to the intended date and therefore it will not be in the early part of 2019 as you suggest.

You would get more help linking the article, but I think I know what the author meant.
When you print money, you print using a printing press, which uses plates that are engraved with the currency design.
The article referred to the plates as a metaphor for printed money. They are saying that the metaphorical plates will be destroyed and no more bitcoin will be created. That is true. But that doesn't mean bitcoin will cease to exist; it just means that the bitcoin will continue to circulate without any more being created. This is a feature of Bitcoin.
