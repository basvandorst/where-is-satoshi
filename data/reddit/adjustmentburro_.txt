i'm surprised there's no way to take a secure snapshot.  surely that can be fixed easily?  i imagine the first snapshot would be the hardest one to take due to the size of the blockchain over the past 10 years
@_date: 2018-09-15 15:49:09
it just sounds like there will still be a lot of on-chain tx's with this system meaning the blocksize may still be an issue?  unless things like schnorr can make place thousands of tx's into one single tx somehow?
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:30:10

i might just do that.  so if i set up a node with say... eclair wallet, is that node limited to the eclair wallet?  or can i use the seed from that node to open that node in another lightning wallet later down the line?

if they have an open channel already with somebody, can they split that channel and connect me to it with the funds they have in that channel without opening a new channel with new funds?
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:34:14
it seems like under these circumstances, mass adoption would cause a lot of strain on-chain even w/ Lightning or am i missing something?
@_date: 2018-09-11 20:36:11
so if i had no BTC, and wanted to buy BTC from coinbase via lightning, they could open a channel with me and send it to me via lightning?

what do you think of Nano?  it uses PoW partly combined with PoS.  all the nano has already been distributed.
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:19:37
i totally agree.  i have been interested in Nano but after studying the nodes issue, it sounds like it's just another centralized coin like bcash but who knows, maybe there will be multiple currencies with tradeoffs for each (centralization, decentralization, etc)

bitcoin was created during pluto in capricorn which we are still in through 2023.  it is all about changing the establishments.  we are seeing govts crumble.  fiat crumble.  colleges crumble.  etc etc etc.  the old world is DONE.  we HAVE entered a new world.

@_date: 2018-10-22 14:14:20
so one of them just told me in order to get my lightning channel funded, i would first need to make an on-chain tx and fund the channel.  for example, i wouldn't be able to create a lightning wallet and buy btc via Lightning from an exchange without first making an on-chain transaction with funds, and then spending those funds and then buying the btc via Lightning from the exchange to refill my channel.  is this true?
@_date: 2018-10-20 18:50:24
thanks, friend, for the answer.  
@_date: 2018-10-19 17:46:42
so they would be strictly limited to using 2nd layer solutions and never touching main chain, right?  which is technically putting trust in exchanges/federation (a la Liquid)?  not saying that's necessarily bad entirely as it's more decentralized than the Dollar, however not as decentralized as obviously 1st layer. 
i assume that as we scale to higher layers, decentralization trade-offs are required, would you agree?  almost like having Ripple on a 2nd layer of bitcoin?

@_date: 2018-10-07 17:09:30
i see what you're saying and i've been warming up to the idea.
however, bitcoin being deflationary, ppl may not need a savings acct w/ "interest", prices of goods/services will simply lower everyday to reflect bitcoin's deflationary nature.
let's be real.  ripple/stellar/dash/bcash, these are all centralized to varying degrees (some not even being a blockchain).  now we could view multiple currencies as a form of decentralization even if some of them are centralized, kind of like what we have today with multiple centralized national currencies, none being the One World Currency.
at the same time, you have to question how much value ppl are going to give some of these centralized currencies like ripple, stellar, etc.  i feel like bitcoin is the most safe/secure/decentralized and will capture much of the value of money.  of course, this depends on lightning/sidechains succeeding as these will be the cash component of bitcoin.  1st layer being the gold standard.
@_date: 2018-10-05 21:52:50
or you can respect what america has done for bitcoin.  when it comes to the Core devs, the first exchanges, the first big players, the first big advocates, etc.  
who bought all of china's products that made china go from a poverty country to where it is today?  american bought them.  who gave more aid than any country in the world in the past 50 years?  america did.

@_date: 2018-10-18 20:15:42
if lightning can solve cheap/fast tx fees (including on-chain fees whether they be 1x/year or 1/x week), then i'm happy staying in btc 100%.  i just wonder if lightning is capable of this for all ppl.
@_date: 2018-10-18 01:39:57
hm, seems like keeping on-chain tx fees is the only way lightning would work then as a transactional "coffee" currency
@_date: 2018-10-30 19:27:00
I shouldn't have to be subjected to the dollar's fluctuation and penalized for it through taxes.
I should be able to denominate things goods/services in BTC. I should have the freedom and choice to do that. 1 BTC = 1 BTC
@_date: 2018-10-05 14:12:48
@_date: 2018-10-04 23:23:07
because it would be like denominating things in cents today.  pretty silly if you ask me.
@_date: 2018-10-19 18:51:11
been here for over a year and still getting mixed answers from devs and ppl in the space.  adam back has said there may be $1,000 on-chain fees in the future should it get lots of traction so it feels like that means a lot of folks would only be able to use btc on 2nd layer.  that's fine, just was seeking confirmation and straight forward answers.  i understand this is all still being developed and no one may know for sure how things will be, and that's fine, but to treat a fellow bitcoiner like this is not constructive.
@_date: 2018-10-05 00:21:01
when bitcoin is 1 million dollars, pricing something in 10,000 satoshis would be like pricing your $100 electric bill as 10,000 satoshis instead of just 100 bits.
to price things in satoshis would only make sense if 1 satoshi = 1 dollar.  and bitcoin market cap would need to be 2 quadrillion, not to mention we would need more than 8 decimal points.  hey, that's fine by me, but ok.

yeah i am not sure 1mb block size would be able to handle even that.  perhaps most ppl will just stay on lightning layer since most ppl dont even have more than $1,000 in their savings.  or actually, yeah most ppl just keep all their money in checkings accounts, and elizabeth stark has said lightning is a checkings acct while main chain is savings account.  which means most ppl would always be on 2nd layer, would you agree?

so like Channel Factories, right?
could you help clarify me on these?  if you and me have a channel open on LN, and there are 10 other ppl who want to get onto Lightning, how do they use OUR channel to open their own LN channels and where do THEIR funds come from?  i guess i'm confused on who a channel between two ppl can become multiple channel between 10 other ppl w/o more on-chain txs needing to be made from the other 10 folks.  also, with 12 of us, is it like a web of channels where 1 person is connected with the other 11?  or is that something we each just designate

@_date: 2018-10-05 04:32:26
it's not about dollars, it's about how we value things today.  are we really going to value a candy bar as 100 satoshis or 1 bit?  are we going to value our $100 electric bill as 100 bits or 10,000 satoshis?

ok, so if the employer and employee open a channel up with each other, only one of them pays the on-chain fee to open it between them, correct?
also, can employee connect that same channel with a friend?  so that if employer closes channel, the employee will still have their funds on Lightning and a channel with their friend?  and will employee have to pay any on-chain fee when employer closes channel between them?
@_date: 2018-10-22 14:12:01
oh wow.  that's kind of limiting, isn't it?  that means everyone would need to make an on-chain tx to get a lightning wallet with funds on it to use which would be a ton of on-chain tx's....
so do you see Lightning as something that 7.5 billion ppl could use as cash one day?  or do you think that's what altcoins are for?
@_date: 2018-10-08 00:33:09
i'm not a big eth fan, and id ont claim to knwo everything.  i feel it's very centralized however it may be less centralized than banks/corporations/govts we have today which is still a positive.  i am not sure however.  eth may go to 0.  but i dont know.  i can see it going either way honestly.
i know the chinese do not like bitcoin or ethereum because one, jihan wu and his antics, and two NEO.

what do you think of altcoins like ripple/dash/etc?  do you think they serve a purpose/niche?  there are obviously decentralization trade-offs however not sure if that's just how the universe works or if those ppl are just being impatient with lightning/development of bitcoin in the long-term
@_date: 2018-10-05 00:21:56
yup.  bitcoin market cap would need to be 2 quadrillion for 1 sat to be $1.  and then we would need more decimal places.  hey, that's fine by me if bitcoin goes to that market cap!!!!

@_date: 2018-10-18 19:17:12
hey, appreciate the write-up.  my portfolio is basically all btc also.  however i do question if btc will just be digital gold instead of a payment currency long-term which is why i asked.  i do wonder if coins like ripple, while they are more centralized than bitcoin, perhaps they are less decentralized than the dollar/federal reserve which is still an improvement on our monetary system today.
for example, ripple can have validators in any country meaning it is decentralized beyond one country where the dollar is centralized to one country and even worse, one corporation called the Federal Reserve which isn't even federal.  i do agree tho that the fact that ripple holds more than half the supply is alarming.

not saying it has to, but do you expect bitcoin to exceed 1 million dollars per bitcoin anytime soon?  if so, that's FINE BY ME.  but dude, if you're going to transition today, you do it to bits for the time being and even that's pushing it, thus why it's still denominated in Bitcoin.

thanks, peter.  i was wondering, do you see bitcoin lightning as something that can be cheap enough to use for everyday user considering on-chain tx fees that may arise should btc be adopted by the mainstream in the future? 
or would you say bitcoin is destined to be an advanced digital gold 2.0 while more centralized altcoins (but still decentralized to a degree and more decentralized than, say, the fiat Dollar) would take the place of everyday cheap/fast cash transactions?

@_date: 2018-10-19 19:29:14
yes, i am familiar with reloading via an exchange's lightning channel.  makes me wonder tho how we transition from using the dollar to only using bitcoin.  yes, i know that's far away.  also, still not sure that really addresses on-chain fees and sovereignty over your coins if you can't afford on-chain fee.  i really am not trying to talk crap, just wondering how it works/how it will work.  so far, i've asked quite a few ppl and gotten many different answers.  which is fine.  i dont think anyone knows for sure what will happen.  
it does make me suspect that bitcoin is perhaps destined to be solely digital gold 2.0 (a much better form of gold with more features) and other coins are meant to be cash.  kind of like today where gold is solely a store of value and cash is utility but not as secure/decentralized but still mostly used.  altho i still feel bitcoin can be used as cash under a custodian like sidechains/lightning but not sure it will be the only cash crypto as it has similar decentralization/scaling trade-offs as other payment altcoins
again, i think bitcoin/lightning/potentially payment altcoins are vastly different than what we have today with gold and the dollar.  the former being way more decentralized, more censorship-resistant, way more efficient/far-reaching/etc  however they may still hold the features of the latter where one is a store of value and the other is about mass utility.

that's fine but 1. america is the top country in the world.  2. bitcoin is largely american more than any other country.  the dollar is the monetary standard for the world.  sure that's changing, but america leads much of this world when it comes to things like money.

i just stated facts.
sorry the truth can be hard to handle initially.
and no, trump is not your typical right.  you're thinking of bush.
trump is more outside of left/right, like ron paul.
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:07:08
how would you compare that to how Ripp1e claims to solve these issues?
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:27:52
it is
@_date: 2018-11-08 18:47:41
thank you for the write-up.  
it seems like 1MB will always be the block size considering how conservative bitcoin is (which is fine), but i hear guys like andreas say we can raise the block size, or people like Matt Corralo who say other projects may be more useful by trading scaling for decentralization as this seems to be a well-understood trade-off.  it seems like there are different levels of trust for each trade-off.  that makes me wonder if bitcoin will just be a digital gold standard and other cryptocurrencies (possibly Lightning, too?) will be like a form of digital fiat but better than fiat today and still more decentralized than fiat today.
what do you think of Lightning? can it be a currency for billions of ppl or is bitcoin just too slow for that?  and if so, would you consider other cryptocurrencies to be more like the fiat to bitcoin's gold?
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:24:02

interesting, altho they would have to have same cap on coins like bitcoin to compete with the monetary policy it has. 
i am not sure we'll see 300 different coins we use.  many people say we'll only have like 5-10 coins max that we'll use on a widespread basis in the future.
you say Lightning is too complicated, but i think the goal is that most people will never make an on-chain tx ever or very rarely (as it will be too expensive, and Hal Finney also said this).  they say on-chain is like a savings account (most people do not have savings accounts as they live paycheck to paycheck or just leave it in checking accounts) and Lightning is like a checking account.  so it would seem that people would just set up channels with a Lightning bank or employer using Lightning, get paid and set up channels thru those institutions using Schnorr/batching/etc where they can set up thousands of channels through one on-chain tx, right?

gotcha.  surprised there's not a way to agree on an objective true pruned node that ignores all 0 balances, say, every 2 weeks, that way keeping the blockchain smaller to carry is much lighter and just as objective as a full node.

yes, trump is not perfect.  he's between bush/obama and ron paul.  sorry, but that's the pill the masses were willing to swallow.  it's better than shillary by one million miles x one million miles.
you guys all act like he's the devil incarnate when actually that was bush and obama.  you guys have ZERO clue what the devil incarnate was really like.
trump is an ANGEL compared to those two.
so i'm sick to death of ppl acting like he's the devil.  ppl are brainwashed by fake news and i'm TIRED OF IT.  you ppl have NO CLUE what the real devil is.

why can't a SPV node be spun up by connecting to another SPV node? i mean, if it's all the same info, i don't see why not.
re: tx pruning, apparently according to greg maxwell in this thread, some already do pruning and it's considered a full node.
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:06:33
how does Ripp1e solve the double-spend problem?
@_date: 2018-11-08 15:22:32
i guess i'm just confused because the whole block size debate was about everyday ppl's ability to run a full node and wouldn't tx pruning solve this issue?  i think Stellar does tx pruning kind of like that Section 7 of the white paper? below is what they told me:
"You need archives to bootstrap nodes, but the archives don't need to be complete.
Aside from including just the hash of the directly preceding ledger, ledgers in Stellar have pointers back to ledgers whose IDs are multiples of 50, 500, 5000, 50000, 500000.
Right now, at  we'd probably only need ~50 historic ledgers to prove the current state correct."
given that, they are working on Lightning for their network too so i'm assuming even tx pruning does not solve ability for everyday ppl to run a full node unless we keep block size "small"?
i appreciate you helping me understand this.  
@_date: 2018-11-09 21:48:34
i agree with you.
labels can be harmful. he's not a 100% conservative but he's more conservative than bush/obama.

can't you just base your pruned node off someone else's pruned node who already based their pruned node off a full node?

well my thinking was:
bitcoin - gold, slow, most decentralized/censorship-resistant
litecoin - silver, faster, less decentralized/etc
stellar - fiat cash, fastest, least decentralized (but still more decentralized than national fiat currencies, thus making it an upgrade to current system)
i picked these three also because they all have Lightning and can use LN to interoperate. sure there are others with LN but these are the main ones.
what do you think?
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:33:17
