Some body told me you can turn an old car battery into a solar / wind battery if you knew where to get the acid to fill them up after getting them from junk lots

One thing you can do is get one of those cheap Android phones and use your wifi to make a wallet then just use that as your wallet and don't activate the phones plan. Saw one forn 25 bucks at walmart

What if we want to sell to coinbase and buy back after it dips. Should I worry about the usd in my coinbase account or immediately transfer it to my bank then retransfer after it drops and buy back? If so do I need to calculate taxes for my gains or just ignore that?

This is a good idea if you know how to do it. These people obviously don't and it is likely the only profitable way to mine Bitcoin these days. If you can get a cheap setup with some wind or mechanic alternator and have batteries set and ready to charge and switch it might not be a bad little side job

i think with the koreans and chinese getting into it, that this is the slow and constant growth that we are seeing.
