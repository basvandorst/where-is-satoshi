It sure is. Dreamhost is having issues again  they haven't been too impressive these past few days. My site has gone down for an hour or two each day. Boooo!

Looks like it's back up now, hopefully it stays that way...

Thanks for that info. I guess the most important thing I need to know is if I would lose the coins acquired after my latest backup.

Could you point me in the direction of instructions on how to do this? More information?

Thanks for the advice. How does it work without the block chain? Isn't that needed to legitimize the transactions? 
@_date: 2012-04-12 16:00:08
Cool, thank you.

Added, thank you.

I was worried that it might come off that way, but I really just wanted advice to make sure I wasn't screwing this up, I couldn't think of an easier way than to just post the page. I'm not asking for donations or anything, I just want to make sure I'm not building my page in a way that limits my ability to accept bitcoins, or exposes me to some security flaw. So far, I have already received some good advice that I responded to right away, and am quite thankful for. Sorry if it came off all spammy, but it isn't my intention.

Wow, this is enlightening. It seems like quite a breach of privacy. Would dynamically generating new addresses be something that is very difficult to set up, do you have any links to instructions for such a thing? I would want to make any transactions as anonymous as possible. I think what people do with their money should be their own business.

How would such a link work? Would it open something in the browser?

How do I sign my address?

Thank you, change made. What is the the distinction between encryption and cryptography?
