Yes.  And I will sell you 1$ in Monopoly money for $1 US.  But Parker Brothers is printing a lot of Monopoly money, so I wouldn't assume you could exchange that back. 
If Tether literally had $1 for every 1 USDT then everything would be fine.  But there is no possible way some tiny polish bank has $2.3 B in assets.  They are printing more USDT just like Parker Brothers.

Imagine if tomorrow you could buy IBM stock with monopoly money.  All of a sudden, a bunch of people would be raiding their game closet and buying IBM stock.  More demand -&gt; increased price.
But that increased price would be fictional.

What is the scam?  Are they as stealing people's money?

2FA doesn't help if you get phished.  It is a man in the middle attack at that point.

It can be both.  Open source means anyone can study the code, or copy it to make their own coin.
But the consensus Bitcoin version is controlled by a select few.  They can reject any proposed changes they don't want. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:57:32
Well, as near as I can tell no one wants any of the coins.  They just trade them back and forth all the time.

I'm calling the CEO of Bitcoin tomorrow and giving him a piece of my mind.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:35:01
Because hardly anyone was using Bitcoin to pay for things, so why bother switching to an alt coin?  There is no demand.

The dotcom bubble pop didn't make people hate the internet. It made people realize that simply having a company on the internet didn't make it valuable.  They grew to hate the silly companies with no real value proposition.
Just like people are starting to realize that simply because something is provably rare via math doesn't mean it is valuable either.

During the dotcom bubble, you couldn't have really invested in "The Internet."  I think most people at the time knew the Internet was going to be around in some form forever, not so much all the goofy companies trying to tie themselves to it, getting millions in funding just for having ".com" in their name.  Kind of like adding "bitcoin" or "blockchain" to your name now.
If there was a way to invest in the internet now, I would do it in a heartbeat, but the internet is not a thing, even though it has pretty much a 100% guaranteed future. Similarly, crypto in some form has a 100% guaranteed future. But a *particular* crypto?  Who knows?

By that logic no one would ever sell any investment.
Would you keep buying it if the price gets down to $5?
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:49:47
You would sell at 3K if you think it is going to go lower.
You do realize that when you buy crypto, there is a corresponding seller somewhere?  Each of you thinks you have more information than the other.  You buy because you think it is going up and the seller sells because they think it is going to go down.

I remember the dot-com boom.  You could copy-paste many of the posts here and replace "bitcoin" with "furniture.com" (or whatever .com) and it would sound exactly the same.

I think it is meant to encourage long term investment.  The stock market always goes up over time, and you make a reasonable profit.  But if you get greedy and try to time things you are going to get hurt.

I can technically buy anything with objects that have value.  I can go buy a cup of coffee in exchange for a $50 coffee maker I bought at Best Buy.  Someone will make that deal with me.
It will cost me the same as if I did it with Bitcoin and it will probably process faster too.

So the safe way to secure your decentralized ~~currency~~ store of value is in a vault that is part of the centralized banking system?

Sure.  I was giving an example of bulls.
A bear would say "I won't invest in X because the fundamentals aren't there or the economy is in a downturn" and stick to that.  You can effectively make money by not investing when it is a bad investment.  Maybe you stay in bonds for a while or whatever.
The key is that you have a strategy and stick to it instead of being greedy and trying to time the dips.
A day trader would be the prime example of a pig in the metaphor.  And most day traders do get slaughtered.

What?  Merchants are dropping bitcoin left and right. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:58:28
Currency has utility for trade and is backed by governments.  Bitcoin has neither of those things.

In the early days of Bitcoin everyone was encouraged to spend and hold.  But back then you could actually spend it.
