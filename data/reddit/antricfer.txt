IIRC Satoshi Nakamoto is a very common name in Japan, like John Smith.

There was a spanish city that implemented Linux and open source on all it's schools and administration . It went horribly wrong. People didn't adapt to the new systems and it cost a fortune to port from Windows , training and support. I don't know how it ended. I'm on phone can't source.

"...This kind of financial transfer is clearly what Bitcoin is for. It should be between the two parties conducting the transaction. Enough with these middlemen." This is the best Bitcoin sales argument I've seen so far. This simple argument, in these words, is what will convince the masses to switch over to Bitcoin, imho.

What about drug cartels connections? I always wondered how did the first drug seller get on silkroad? Silkroad was based on trust, how the fuck are you going to trust someone you don't know or cant be found? There must have been some kind of deal to kick the whole thing off.

I found out about  btc around 2013 I think, on r/trees. There was a discussion where to get weed when you move into a new town and someone quietly mentioned the silk road. Went there and the only way to order was with bitcoin so I researched. At the time the price was usd20 and fluctuated wildly. At some point I had 20 btc in a wallet and I didn't want to risk losing 400 so I sold it all at 19 before it would go down even more. I try not to think about it too much.

Google has a dead man switch now that checks on you periodically . I mailed myself an encrypted mail with my coins and other stuff. If I die, my son will receive a mail with instructions and access to my Google account. The encryption password is not written anywhere but is something he will know when he reads the clue.
@_date: 2016-07-24 21:50:22
It's a numbers game. The royal mail handles 8 million items daily. This fact and denial plausibility makes the risk much more acceptable. The hard part to stay anonymous, I read in an article is acquiring bitcoins.

Let's face it, bitcoin IS complicated. We need this animation, we also need a simple app with just two buttons: send and receive. That's it, no fancy menus. Just good ol cash in the screen. Is it doable?

I always get the sr argument when I introduce people to bitcoin. My standard answer is "how did people pay for that before bitcoin?" 
Now I have a more sophisticated answer. I'll just send them the link for this article.

You r lucky, usually banks charge an hefty fee for international transfers. Transferwise, from the creators of Skype, only charge 1 pound and use interbank rate instead of the ripoff rate banks give you. And they're fast too. Im never using banks again.
@_date: 2013-04-19 13:59:58
Thanks for that. I thought transactions were irreversible, how do you override a transaction?

Man... You r in uk. Use transferwise to bitstamp. It took me literally 5mns to do it online. Funds usually land next day at bitstamp ready to buy those yummy coins..  And the whole process costs 1 pound. No other fees and you can use your debit card. Really, it cant get any easier or cheaper than this...

I strongly disagree. Quite the opposite actually.

You just said up there that govs wouldn't be able to educate you to perpuate them in power. Look at you, already planning to pay your taxes to your master even without him asking you to do so. 
I think you are already educated.

It's not about if will happen, but when. Surely we cannot expect that big business, banks and govs, to take it in the chin and do nothing about something that is directly threatening their livelihoods. We know this is coming, the question is: Are we ready for it?
