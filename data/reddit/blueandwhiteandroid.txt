Joe smokes a ton of weed, yes, I think an otherwise laid back cat would be a little on the paranoid side under the circumstances.

A slow clap is now in progress.

now Walter White can convert some that cash in his storage unit.

I am not truly onboard with a concept until it the hit piece from Salon drops. Finally, I push all chips in cryptocurrencies and never look back. If Salon has anything insightful to report, would someone contact me?

I have bounced back and forth between reading this subreddit and cursing it and swearing off of it. I love the reddit platform, but this is my favorite subreddit to talk shit about. I appreciate the passion here, but stay classy San Diego.

I hope this post prompts more people to closely watch the blockchain and report on it. I know I will.

I am for contributing, as long as the result is that Newsweek is the one apologizing. Does that rag have editors that have a brain?

"millions of real dollars", I think Joe Rogan has plenty of fiat money. I consider bitcoin to be more real than Joe's millions of "1's and 0's" as he calls money. Of course, I knew what you meant, but I thought it was an interesting interaction between Andreas and Joe. I think Joe was just a bit suspicious over what things Andreas might do upon gaining access to his phone. I know I might have a similar nervous reaction.

I hope the phrase "51% attack" is removed from the Bitcoin lexicon. It makes no sense unless there are exactly 100 nodes in the Bitcoin P2P network. Furthermore, it doesn't even need to be a majority of nodes to cause damage. Maybe a better phrase is "bad actor problem". I catch your drift though.

can the feds just take the BTC they got from the silk road bust as payment for them to just go away?

I mean no disrespect, but can we not upvote "bitcoin accepted here" stories? Good for you and all, but it isn't news for the vast majority of us.

China thinks that Bitcoin is the enemy of the dollar, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Anything that unseats the dollar as the world's reserve currency will do. And yes, it is possible to crack down on Bitcoin once Bitcoin serves its purpose. They'll do it the same way they have always done it. By pitting neighbor against neighbor and scaring people into never transacting with Bitcoin. Very devious, but it will work.

I would definitely get it mining ASAP, but 5 Gh/s is a drop in the ocean compared to the network hash rate of about 5 Ph/s. I hope your electric rates are reasonable. At least you have a "vote", albeit a small one, on the P2P network.

"By cycling as much fiat into BTC as possible and then spending that, you do the BTC economy a great amount of good." A better way to say this is that you do the exchanges very good by giving them their cut. You take a 2-3% haircut on this exchange and take 100% of the risk during the long transaction cycle. You can make up for this if the vendor gives you a discount, but is it really worth it? Maybe, maybe not, it is still a pain in the ass that very few will actually do.
