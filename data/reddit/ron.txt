As we type, the Keyboard Commandos of the 101st Chairborne are furiously writing about how fiat currencies cannot be trusted because they aren't "backed" by anything.

Profitable investment, or stable currency. 
Pick one. Can't get both.

One government just triggered a 40-50% loss, which would make this one of the more easily manipulated currencies on record.

A "principle" that's been demonstrably wrong for five years in a row, probably one of the most public and embarrassing demonstrations of wrong that has ever wronged in the history of wrong.
I mean, it'd be right if the red line in [this graph]( tracked the blue line at any point at all since 2008, but, it doesnt, so, it isn't:

Begs the question, are there reliable ways to short bitcoin?  I never gamble when I can't bet against the other players.

Or are seasoned veterans of the bubble wars with the capital losses to show for it.  Or studied economic theorists and historians. 
But yeah, it's probably just totally Jew hatred and crippling depression.

Sounds stable, to whom do I give my fiat currency

Wouldn't be prudent to specu...sorry.
What I am certain of is that I can still buy 100% of the Christmas presents I intended to buy this year, and approx 98.93% of last years Christmas presents if their prices were adjusted for inflation.  
Curse these fiat shackles!

Haha, a cursory glance at my comment history will show how little interest I have in bitcoin and its peers.  Philosophically, I see lack of convenient shorting options as being a method to manipulate prices upward; I've only anecdotal quotes from friends asking why I'd want to do that.  Presumably they'd hate seeing a mechanism to temper the uninhibited growth of their wager,  which would lead them to invent what we now call financial regulation, piece by piece.  But that's just an anecdote.

ah, no, it's my bad, longtime lurker, first-time poster, etc.

Peg the value of BTC to comedy gold and we're all millionaires by February.

Can't speak to the orphanage issue, but coin volume and spam are irrelevant.  
Volume just means one adjusts the price of goods/services sold to reflect volume/value of currency in use.  The absolute value of such doesn't matter.
And spam? How exactly is that any different than how BTC got its start by basically saying by fiat, "hay we're here plz use us plz"
