If you hold them for 1 year, you pay no capital gains. I'm not sure what the situation is for mined bitcoins.

That the NSA created it seems plausible to me, sure.

So you have a few thousand?
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:56:10
That means trusting the random number generator of bitaddress.org.
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:41:54
Apparently not, since the browser complains that /src/crypto-js/crypto.js failed to load.

So you're retiring off of your bitcoins? How many do you have?
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:12:36
All you have to do to get the submodules is append "--recursive" to your `git clone` invocation.
The problem is that the crypto-js repository (now under src/crypto-js/ or something in my pull of your fork) uses a completely different build process. One which I'm not familiar with enough to actually build it.

Do these prefixes have security implications I should worry about? I suppose I can be sure that 6Pf keys have never existed in memory somewhere, except that I test all of my keys by rebooting and decrypting them (wouldn't want to have made a mistake copying them out)..

I would say someone with 10000 btc can retire. That's over 11 million usd.
I would also say someone with 5000 btc can retire. But what about 1000 btc? I would say they have retirement covered, but shouldn't quite their job.
Would you agree with those numbers?
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:19:35
Then what key length should I go for?
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:31:03
bitaddress doesn't directly rely on Math.random or window.crypto - it uses these to seed the pool of an rc4 stream. If there is something broken with this implementation, it could significantly reduce the entropy of all private keys generated from bitaddress.org, regardless of hardware.

Which island refused?
What's the state of trading BTC in person in Barbados? Is there much of that happening already?
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:44:44
Just send the prize money as BTC to the genesis block address.

Could be an interesting way to sample the rate of bitcoin adoption. Print out and leave behind paperwallets at random locations, recording the gps address for each one. Then map the time a transaction occurs from a mapped address.

Can someone provide a solid estimate of golds global market cap?
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:01:19


I think this is wrong actually. I think the passphrase just encrypts the otherwise randomly generated private key.
You could in theory decrypt the private keys and re-encrypt them with a different BIP38 passphrase.
I could be wrong though.

Nice! url of the video?

Do you understand why the addresses generated this way all start with 6PR, while the address generated in batch by bitaddress.org all start 6Pf?

"free man's money" doesn't float on bandwidth.
Why do you care who created it? It's open source.

if bitcoins really take off most people will have most of theirs managed by a third party. They might have their own hardware wallet as a checking account though.

Those of you who feel like your lives have been changed financially by bitcoins, how many do you have?
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:42:48
/demo/split-key.html still points to /src/crypto-js/crypto.js, which doesn't exist after running `grunt`
Does that demo work for you at this point? I might be doing something wrong.

I don't get twitter. It looks like coindesk said this, not 
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:26:04
I tried to use your fork but it seems like crypto-js git submodule isn't built by the Grunt build process?
How do I build crypto-js, or better yet, how do I add it to Gruntfile.js?
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:27:03
How many bitcoins do you have then?
