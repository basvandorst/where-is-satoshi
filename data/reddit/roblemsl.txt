You know I heard sending a paper money order through the US post office might take longer than an electronic method like BTC or a CC, but I always thought, no why would it take any longer? After all, I wants my stuffs now! 
Now we all know, thanks so much for clearing this point of confusion up for all of us...

I don't follow "Mish" but he is obviously a gold thumper, and still fairly misinformed about bitcoins. He did a nice job in cherry picking the time frames in order to get a "9 percent drop in the price of gold was matched by a 70% plunge in the price of bitcoins". You can easily pick points that show a 30% "plunge" in the price of gold and the recent relative stability of bitcoin.  No real understanding that bitcoin valuation is so high recently due to injection of value and greater acceptance as a legit currency. It's cute that he has upgraded his status from "scam" to "a game". Metal in your pocket is still only worth what people agree what it is worth, no more no less.

Since when does .com have anything to do with where a domain is hosted or where that company resides? virwox.com is based in Vienna, Austria and owned by Virtual World Services GmbH.

IF I understand your intent, I think you are going about it the wrong way. You are unlikely to to get much of a positive response from established organizations. No more than you would expect a grocery store to just take Bitcoin. (you might as well be offering them fairy dust, and even DOUBLE fairy dust is nothing to them)
If you placed these offers out into the independent freelance community you would likely get a much better response. I know this is a lot more risk on your end than picking a specific established firm, but there you go.
