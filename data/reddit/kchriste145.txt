That's what I was thinking too.  F2pool was involved in this Segwit deployment, so perhaps it's a rehearsal for the big leagues?

After reading some of his previous tweets, it seems as if he's being deliberately vague and unclear about which direction he'll take.  Many back and forth messages and nonsensical justifications.
I think he has a clear idea of what he wants to do, but he can't say directly what his intentions are.  Actions speak louder than words, and he's helped implement Segwit on Syscoin, and now Litecoin looks like it will activate.
I wouldn't be surprised if he comes up with some strange reason why he signals Segwit on Bitcoin when the time comes...

They were the most ardent opponents of SegWit.  They still have the 'why I oppose SegWit' tweet pinned, but they've probably seen how the other alts have increased in price and want a way out of their past pronouncements and get in on the price action.  It could also be a reaction to the alts' increase share of the overall crypto market.
It doesn't really matter to me why they're considering a change.  As long as we move forward!

So ViaBTC posts a poll asking what the public's opinion on SegWit is, knowing full well that the vast majority of the Bitcoin public wants it.  When the poll predictably ends up favouring SegWit, ViaBTC basically tells us "Tough sh!t.  We don't care what users want".  It's almost as if they planned it this way - like some kind of power trip.
Dick move.

Maybe... But F2Pool did something very similar - trashed SegWit for weeks on end, then did a poll and quickly implemented SegWit thereafter.
So either they grossly miscalculated what the feedback would be despite the widely available information favouring SegWit, or they're wiggling out of their previous position because it won't be profitable and they'll end up on the wrong side of history.
