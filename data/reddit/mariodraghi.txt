People paid by the old system,  are shilling the old system. Who would have thought? 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:09:22
There was a python script someone wrote on bitcointalk to create the addresses. You would have to install python and all the libraries he is importing and then insert the first 12 words into the seed variable and the 13th one as the password variable and then run the script.

What country are you located in? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:09:58
Before I wanted to donate I took a quick look at the address you posted which was "1GLoEUV1QBuuyJHseaKCXiQDsvH5Jpehqi". That address however has outgoing transactions to the address "1Fu3iBR2EMQWeYGi3XvrPmcPUkne8ZWj9h" which supposedly belongs to a gambling site source:  Can anyone clear this up or did I missread the transactions?
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:07:39
Coinomi or mycelium for example let you send from paper wallets. So just start with the Bitcoin wallet and send that to your segwit address. Afterwards you can sweep your bcash on coinomi and then send to an exchange from there or whatever. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:50:06
But those bitcoin wouldn't stay at the exchanges? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:33:08
I salute the Koreans for their great response. I can only hope citizens of other countries will voice their opinion equally if governments start to come for their crypto.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:17:24
No thanks I'll stick to Amazon coins
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:22:43
Well some wallet of your choice that supports those addresses that start with a 3 such as a Trezor for an example. You sweep the bcash with the app coinomi on an android phone for instance. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:26:52
With bitcoin you are your bank. Quite a few people dont seem to realize how big the responsibility is that comes with that. To me that means when it comes to security you should leave nothing to chance. Of course adjust your measures according to the value you want to store but if its meaningful to you definitely try to make it close to impossible that you lose that money. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:40:08
Thats debateable. For the average joe in the western world crypto provides no urgent usecase like drugs where the scenario you describe applies. Maybe in countries with harsh capital control measures but that also implies that there are still countries with fiat entry points left.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:52:54
Thats because you have to "stake" or "loan" some amount for a fixed time length.

Wow are you the real Charles? Do you know why you remind so many people of Steve Jobs?

You're right. Im switchting to bitconnect the only real crypto not manipulated by tether.

How can you not hate politicians?
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:09:51
Because currency is about more than paying for your coffee at starbucks. Wait till cash is abandoned and everyone is forced to pay negative interest while there is rising inflation. You better also never make a payment that gets you flagged for money laundering or is against the will of your government/bank because by then your access to the financial system can be turned off at any time by those in charge. Not to speak of all the private/public bailouts, QE that you are forced to pay/endure because of centralized power over currency in the eurozone. If you don't believe me travel to cyprus or greece and ask them what happened to their money and how much control they had over it after shit hit the fan.

This guy is insane or a scam lol. After I told him he shouldn't trust anyone he pmed me and asked if I want to buy them. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:53:14
Well the guy did not specifically ask for native segwit. Is the benefit you get from native segwit addresses over those starting with a 3 that big? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:55:32
I did think the same. Then I discovered this

I agree but sometimes its not always clear if you're investing or gambling.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:11:24
Do you still have a backup in form of the seed words for an example?
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:16:27
If you actually still know your bitcoin addresses that store the money that might be very helpful if you're dealing with stupid thiefs. Once the coins enter an exchange there might be a chance that the police can actually find out who stole that money from you.

Why does the person have to transfer funds there instead giving you signed message of the funds where they hold their coins currently? Be cautious guys
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:20:42
probably more like an address that has been used otherwise you would be stuck in an infinite loop for the first seed you try.

So if someone is taking that loan to buy crypto and hopes that it will outpace the interest rate its investing?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:25:41
Lightning with 1mb does not either. But where is the vote about it?
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:02:39
copy paste them into a new text file? Or write a script if you know any programming.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:54:02
Yes of course millions of new people in the market have nothing to do with it must be a conspiracy instead. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:30:49
Well you could try it in electrum and make a watch only wallet where you import the addresses. Don't know for how many addresses that works though.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:46:36
I was there. My memory is unfortunately not good enough to remember a day to day story. What I do remember however was that trading was basically completely dominated by mt. gox which caused constant difficulties as they weren't able to handle the traffic. During busy days or crashes especially their trading engine would lag horrendously with an hour+ blacklog. For some time there was also this weird feeling of the price going artificially up despite that everybody knew that it was fueled by people who would buy for inflated prices as they could only get btc out of the exchange. Even when this was common knowledge and there was a relatively large margin to the price on other exchanges it still drove the price up everywhere. When it was official that they have gone bankrupt it felt a little bit like doomsday and mark karpeles(ceo of mt.gox) hate went through the roof. In the long run that was a good thing though as now we have access to much better run and distributed exchanges.

Fair point though I think they are not quite comparable yet. Crypto has drawn in a rather different crowd than your average stock/index fond investor combined with a lack of institutional money. Also try having a decent conversation with these newcomers its absolutely mind boggling it really feels like we are back to the pets.com days.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:50:26
Since the private key is just a number you can divide it into many parts with Shamir secret sharing method  You can decide in how many parts to split it and how many of those are necessary to recover the key. If you want to keep it simpler you can also take the number in binary format and make a one time pad out of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:13:49
I'm not sure whether blockchain uses the same standard but you could also try to recover the private keys with this tool 
To be safe try it while being offline
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:22:23
Spamming? Do you really believe that this is just spam when all metrics point to a huge increase in people actually owning and using bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:09:52
So you had the forked coins and still panicked? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:55:44
Thats not how you measure irregularities. Give some meaningful data otherwise its just nonesense.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:31:41

@_date: 2017-12-07 08:36:59

@_date: 2017-12-26 06:53:04
Installed new apps recently or have a rooted phone?
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:23:50
Ok yeah well that downtime event is nothing compared to what happened on mt.gox back in the days. Considering the guys running backing it Im pretty optimistic that they will scale much smoother and have done pretty good in my opinion considering their influx of new users. However their opinion on 2x confused me as well.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:44:32
Yeah also don't get run over by a truck and try to stay out of planes that crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:23:59
He already has been there just search on youtube
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:39:35
The forked coins suggestions sounds somewhat reasonable but then he is still pretty much gambling whether they had money there on the fork date and even then it probably isn't worth that much. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:46:39
I'd be much more concerned about most alts and tokens. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:23:28
I don't know their strategy is really confusing. Bitcoin has been treated fairly well by their state sponsored news for years but government officials have mostly spoke negatively about it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:18:54
Well it would but comes at the disadvantages that were mentioned here countless times. But I have never seen an actual vote about it despite people claiming to know what the majority actually wants.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:23:54
The market has been on a massive bull run did you really think that this would go on forever?
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:07:14
There was no attack just millions of new people... It's Christmas holidays time for most people hence less transactions and decreasing Mempool. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:03:04
He is right concerning taxes in Germany 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:01:24

@_date: 2017-12-15 12:45:09
I guess we need a sticky post to warn newcomers. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:25:42
We are above 20mil blockchain.info wallets alone. Why can't you guys do some simple math to figure out that all it takes these days is a tiny percentage of the existing userbase to fill the Mempool just by totally legitimate use such as sending from/to exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:00:46
It does actually. If the transactable value is a mere couple billions and is spread among the whole population what economic activity can you expect to be there? Maybe a few coffees and chewing gums purchases.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:55:37
To be fair you could only send a couple billions back then nowadays even bill gates could transfer his whole wealth in bitcoin.

Hey at least  he's using segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:19:52
This point hast already been proven wrong in the past by Bitcoin being used for bitpay, silk road, crypto credit cards... The main reason it's useless as mainstream currency for now are its onchain scaling limitations that have led to very costly fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:13:10
It doesn't really matter where you store it outside. You can have various weather conditions such as extreme heat, humidity, extreme cold etc. probably not best place to store a cheap flash drive. Then flash drives are super unreliable as they get older anyways, plus having only one copy and in only one medium is not good practice either. In an ideal way you would store these things distributed so you have no single point of failure like for instance in a secret sharing scheme and preferably both analog and digitally.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:28:36
This only works as long as nobody uses it..
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:39:15

Greece is also not really comparable since they aren't financially sovereign plus the dollar basically is the global reserve currency.

Any good resources to read up on the tech and how to use it? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:00:20
Or maybe the price just had a correction after a massive bull run and new people panicked and all wanted to get their money to exchanges to sell.
I feel like that's exactly what we saw the last few days.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:07:51
There is no mistake 1mb will never be enough. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:11:42
Try  on an offline machine to restore all your keys manually. Afterwards you can check each address separately on blockchain.info and then sweep them with a different wallet if there is no way for mycelium to find your coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:00:36
Did you maybe restore the wrong seed then? Or maybe try more then 20, you can select how many keys to generate from the seed below the derived addresses field. Otherwise I got no explanation for that.
@_date: 2018-09-13 11:05:59

Due to lazy-/selfishness I never donated even though I felt he would totally deserve it after watching all his youtube videos. If you can't do it in an act of kindness think about it as an investment as without people like andreas our coins wouldn't be nearly worth as much at this point as they are.

I don't get how so many people seem to want to read about alts here. I come here to read about bitcoin, when I want to read about other currencies I go to their sub. I find it awfully distracting and painful to read through all those posts by idiots who can't stay in their own sub but rather have to spread their bullshit everywhere.

unfortunately I don't.

What sort of "research" do you expect to be there? You can write all the papers you want on what you think what might happen, truth is no one really knows.
What you should really ask yourself if you could stand seeing the price crashing like hell without panic selling for a loss. Also don't fool yourself there are definitely long term risks involved as well.
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:50:26

I agree with you that the decision between 1MB or 2MB seems arbitrary. 2x does not solve the problems were facing now in any way it may only kick the can down the road for a few months/weeks while introducing new difficulties.

Limited issuance is not 100 percent guaranteed its just a promise.
Also exchanges would be the most crucial part of hft as that's where the price is decided. But more importantly I'm pretty sure you can front run someone on the blockchain level when you have influence on big miners and know which transactions you are competing with. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 10:34:24
Does have nothing to do with segwit. If no one ups their sat/byte, fees don't rise even when the Mempool fills up. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 13:23:36
You are talking about the time/effort it takes to fill up the mempool. When the mempool is already full and keeps growing it doesn't matter if you got segwit or not because then fee price is all about how much competition for validation in the next blocks you got.

Sure there might also be spam I wasn't denying that. However we are past a point where the mempool can also fill up by legitimate use such as for instance during wild price swings when people want to transfer to/from exchanges. Are you really thinking that the current system scales to 10mil+ users without any mempool congestions?
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:22:51
You don't have to believe me the info is out there.one instance I can recall is this debate on youtube  
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:05:44
Shill? Im in this game for 5 years as you can see by my post history and I do think that core generally does a good job. But I can't stand this talk about how we only have these problems because of supposedly spam transaction. There has been a huge influx of new people over the past 1-2years there is now way on earth that 1-2mb can provide a "bone dry" mempool for all of them at all times. Even with 100percent Segwit adoption further scaling has to be taken very serious and needs to be seen as an urgent matter.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:52:22
Harder to deal with and to be safe you need an offline computer that signs the transactions and never goes online again. In terms of security they are just as safe as long as you create/use them with trusted software and offline only.

For miners that are only active on Litecoin this might be true. But once they hold/mine many coins they could also be concerned about implications for their other coins which possibly cost them more overall than what they gain from LTC.
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:10:02
Well if the price drop wasnt predicted by the model it obviously was a bad move since you could have just cashed out to fiat and then got 4 btc after the drop. But the first thing to know would be how accurate it is for each single currency against the dollar. All the rest is build on top of that anyways.

You can also recreate that on bitaddress.org on the brainwallet section. Basically the idea was to let users create a bitcoin address/private key by imputting an arbitrary passphrase.
Also do you still know where you bought your coins? If it was an exchange you could log in and find out to which address you sent them and then search for that on your computer.

@_date: 2017-10-26 15:38:07
That doesn't make much sense. You cannot have the benefits of bitcoins by centralizing it. While they eliminate the risk of 51% attacks they only do so by becoming the potential 51% attacker themself.  And as people may not really care about the fact that its decentralized they do care about its scarcity and lack of supervision which is guaranteed by decentralization. Also this blockchain for banking talk to this day has been mostly bullshit spread by people that wouldn't even know how to use one let alone implement one. If you can think of any good reason why banks should switch their current system to a private blockchain please tell me as I have yet to hear one.

Miners follow value true. Its not that simple though as they could feel like that the expected reward in the longterm is much bigger if they follow the less valuable chain right after the fork.  Even the shitty trading lags at mtgox have caused major dips in the past and in that event nobody would be able to move funds in a timely manner. That might be really scary especially for all those newcomers that bitcoin gained in the last 12 months. I think the situation is a lot more dangerous then the common opinion on this sub seems to be.

Holding is what made a lot of millionaires in cryptos, stocks or assets in general and takes less luck than maneuvering through endless random daytrades. Also why would it go mainstream at this point? You don't need cryptos to pay your bills, western currencies are relatively stable at this point, a lot of people have no considerable savings that they can afford to put into a high risk asset such as cryptos and financial illiteracy is pretty common as well.  
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:42:15
Yes tell us what it looks like when you open the files. I mean not literally copy pasting it but just the starting letter and the length of the whole key. That way you can figure out if it's just storing the address to look at the funds or if you can actually spend them.

You're right this really looks like spam. Is there any research about how much of the overall transactions came from similar transactions? But the point still stands that even with conservative estimates of usage by the total amount of users the mempool gets filled pretty quick. There are 20mil+ blockchain.info wallets and probably quite a few million more of other providers. Max amount of transactions processed per day was like 490k. So If you say you got about 30-40 million wallets in total you max out the networks capacity if even 1-2% of them send just one transaction a day. So how do you expect the network to absorb this going forward without us seeing a clogged mempool from time to time?

I think there is another way. If a secure way to split coins is communicated large holders that support core could force the 2x price down for as long as possible and hopefully force miners to decide between extinction or switching back to the original chain.

So my question stands why not buy up every property then if its riskfree money?
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:42:09
Technical aspects aside have you spent time studying relevant aspects to money such as creation, use and implications. If the answer is no and the topic is interesting to you definitely look into it. Personally I found bitcoin interesting before spending time on it and just afterwards through bitcoin got hooked on the subject of money itself. It made me appreciate Bitcoin even more and might make you see some value in it. If not fair enough the normal banking/money system normally works just fine on the surface.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:28:36

How is SegWit on-chain scaling? Isnt the increase a twofold increase at best? Scaling would imply 100-1000x .

Its not equivalent when you consider the actual amount of dollars necessary to raise the price by that level. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 07:46:24
I think its gonna happen at 3841.14$
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:19:37
From the forum you can read that those 10k coins were worth around 41$ which means 0.0041$ per coin. At the time of this writing they are worth 1700-1800ish  so an increase by a magnitude of 426829. If the price would increase by such an amount again the current market cap of 30B would rise to 12.8 quadrillion. I would say you can safely order your pizza without having to worry about this.
@_date: 2017-05-05 18:47:44
Its not an assumption. I never said the amount of bitcoins for sale is equal at both price levels just that if it were the dollar amount would differ significantly to give an example. You are right though that it is absolutely possible that the amount of bitcoins for sale can vary quite a bit. This is another reason why the original argument is pointless and the price rise is not equivalent.
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:45:24
How do you calculate 420k per coin? Price of a single coin is 426829 times higher than back in the pizza days. Which means if coins were to increase by that amount again a single coin would cost : 1700*426829 = 725609300
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:45:40
Well with 10% per year it shouldnt be hard to raise more than enough capital. A guy called Madoff did just that he ran a Ponzi though if you can do it legit its a no brainer I guess.
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:29:43
To be fair I said 10-15% and I also said without high risk. It might totally work for some buildings and areas but to say that this is essentially money printing is BS unless you can back that claim up with data.
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:48:06
Youre right most people dont fund their life through their capital. There is this thing called work that pays you a salary which is how most people actually fund their life. Also how can you believe that there is such a thing as generating 10%-15% return by doing virtually nothing and not exposing yourself to high risk.

@_date: 2018-04-25 07:49:46
The amount of dollars spent is meaningless as you can create huge transactions that take up lots of space and therefore are obviously more expensive in absolute terms. What matters is sat/byte which was at roughly 100 sat and can be reasonable at times where the transaction is urgent but the mempool is a bit clogged.

The answer does not make any sense and it does not matter what we think. If an equal amount of bitcoins have to be bought up before the price can rise at both price levels the necessary amount of dollars differs by a factor of 4.

You said "Real estate prices will crash down. Bank interest rstes will go to near nothing." 
The exact opposite happened since interest rates have been set close to 0.
Concerning food costs I don't need the media since I know for a fact that Im not spending considerably more than when QE started but if you got one you're welcome to provide stats that show a tremendous increase in all QE nations. Average rent might have gone up but not to the point where the average guy can't afford it anymore if you exclude outliers like london,SF etc. again if you can provide stats on massive homelessness in japan/europe/US feel free to do so. Debt has gone up for sure but thats what it usually does in our system.

Twofold at this point is just kicking the can down the road. If bitcoin continues to grow like technology usually does we would have the same problems in no time. No idea how this is scaling to you. Lightning might do the trick but that obviously isn't on-chain.

@_date: 2017-05-05 21:00:13
Read properly. 10% steadily per year is good enough to have money thrown left and right at you which said person used to run a ponzi. So if you somehow found a way to do this in a legitimate way you would be an total idiot for not exploiting it to the fullest right now. But then again I wonder why people still buy billions of government bonds for low single digits if they could just print 10%.

As you live in the euro zone I'd recommend  or  .
First one is french, euro funds you hold on the site are secured, has a little low volume at times though but has been working pretty good for me so far.Fee is 0,498% per exchange. They accept SEPA or normal bank wires.
Other site is the biggest exchange in germany but also works for english speaking customers. Also accepts SEPA wires and obviously also doesn't have the same amount of volume mt.gox has. User experience has been very good for me so far though. The Fee per trade is 1% which is split between buyer and seller.
Oh and both sites also let you use two factor authorization and my account was verified after about one day on both sites. 
So as long as you don't want to invest six figure amounts both sites should do just fine.

"Debated answering here but... 33, combined worth of just under 2 mil(wife and I) so technically, I am not a millionaire, by myself.
How'd we do it. Combined income of over 350k while living below our means (I drive a Jetta), working hard, making smart investment choices and not being afraid to try shit out. Started by flipping a house at 25 that netted 135k in profit, was able to afford down payment on another property along with a bigger house. We also skim 20 off the top of each cheque and invest in low cost index funds, started doing that in about 2007, so the bulk of my investments have gone swimmingly.
Lastly after trying several business ideas out I finally made some dough with some algo trading on crypto currencies, this has really boosted net worth because I do it on the side. I don't think my situation is unique though, at best I would say I'm just slightly ahead of the curve, and most people that read this will likely be worth at least a million in their life.

Earning by mining probably can be ruled out unless you have a rich family that supports you. So you can either spend a few bucks to buy some or sell stuff/offer work for recieving them in return. Considering your age I would certainly not worry as bitcoins are a really good way to learn about money in general.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:26:03
Dont worry the seller loses control over those coins as soon as the coins enter the market. They get credited to your account after the seller verifies your payment. If theres any problem about it just contact their support. I never had any problems though.

It's even possible without all these conspiracy theories of governments trying to manipulate the markets. If people simply sit on their coins and don't spend them merchants might turn away what could be a huge blow to the price and trust into the currency. With its killer application in the drug market bitcoins in my opinion can't be killed entirely though.

So for me its rather obvious that you're target customer probably is very rare in the bitcoin community and those who are in there probably aren't aware of your service. I can only speak for me personally but I for an example wouldn't buy a watch for 2k+ no matter how many bitcoins/dollars I had and since most bitcoin holders are pretty young I guess that applies for many of them as well.

Litecoin was a creation of guys who were angry that they missed out the early days of bitcoin and therefore copied its system. They have no big merchants accepting them and just recently got their own silk road clone no idea how successful that is though.

They seem to have a relatively small user base in the first place so its quite obvious that they wont get flooded with bitcoins just because they accept them. 
Plus just what Micro_lite says why would the average joe go through the process of not only researching what bitcoins really are and then purchasing them on a platform where they have to go through the hassle that comes with it when they can simply use paypal which they are probably familiar with and offers them protection.

Martingale does only work with an unlimited supply of funds which would take away the whole purpose of gambling in the first place. I would say you have two options either cash everything out or put them into a cold storage and give them to somebody you trust 100% who only gives them to you for spending or selling. Also avoid any gambling opportunity(includes trading) for the rest of your life as you seem to be a risk candidate, if you cant you should seek professional help.

@_date: 2013-05-12 13:30:05
And you determine that this makes it worth on what calculation exactly? 
@_date: 2013-03-02 13:08:14
Bitcoins wont make it without users willing to spend them. Way too many people still think like you and keep hoarding them solely as speculative investment, this is wrong and was one of the reason why the bubble burst happened. 
Its also crucial to get more companys to accept them thus increasing demand and trust into bitcoin which in the end will decide about its success and prize as without its use as medium of exchange bitcoin would just be a ponzi scheme. There is your economic reason.

Flip a coin. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 17:16:24
So I send you 1000 bitcoins and will get 2000 back?
@_date: 2013-07-15 13:54:34
I think It would be even cooler to put private keys on them with a little amount to claim. Kinda hard to organize effectively though.
Nevertheless good job!
@_date: 2013-04-02 10:42:37
Well I guess no company would pay a fixed amount of bitcoins but rather adjust monthly 
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:04:33
wtf are they somehow related to bitcoin-central?
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:14:31
Even more important than getting them to accept it is using it as a currency yourself. Just buy everything you need/can with bitcoins and if you dont want to reduce your btc holdings just buy those btc back on the market. So in the end your effectively spending fiat but also help adoption.

You can sell stuff at bitmit.net it works basically like ebay. And yeah work depends on your skills
@_date: 2013-04-17 14:38:31
I second that. Plus otherwise id probably not find out about all these cool places where i can spend my coins now.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:28:19
There is no way around volatility on the road to success for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-22 11:39:58
Short answer: nothing but a far more superior system and lots of work. Good luck with that!
@_date: 2013-03-24 10:18:25
You should rather get them to accept bitcoin donations.

Relax man we survived 2011 and we'll get through this as well.

Looks like its quite a large porn site. Alexa ranks it at ~1000
@_date: 2013-04-27 12:17:52
Have you even read the book?Because I dont think your take on it fits it very well.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:39:36
I must be blind I cant see any of these explanations in my post.
@_date: 2013-04-03 11:39:06
I would argue that no one is able to predict the future of bitcoins/cryptocurrencies. Some people will eventually be right but that doesn't mean their prediction was in any way more profound than the opposite.
@_date: 2013-05-16 18:07:03
Max at his best. Nuff said
@_date: 2013-06-15 15:31:52
Yeah that should be valid.
@_date: 2013-05-12 12:50:21
Id rather say acting stupid than lucky but I suppose thats a matter of taste.
@_date: 2013-04-27 09:50:21
Ok. Do you own an ASIC because otherwise its probably not worth the effort.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:47:27
Why shouldn't they?
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:12:01
Well they are some kind of a middle man they hold his coins and as long as you can proof that you send him the cash they will credit his coins to your account in case the seller doesnt act.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:00:32
I was rather talking about the circle jerk thing which you can't deny is certainly not much different than here. And of course they have to think  this way because litecoin would never exist without bitcoin in the first place and also won't exist for long when bitcoin fails due to being almost identical.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:44:42
Does this 2200 second lag mean if I were to put in an order right now it would have no chance to get executed before that time was over?
@_date: 2013-02-17 16:00:57
Good Job! Keep that spirit up.

I wonder why it seems so hard for people to wrap their head around this simple idea.
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:05:36
Very interesting maybe tell r/litecoin about it and stop spamming this sub with that nonsense.
