Is it really Fud?  It happened.  People reacted obviously within minutes of the announcement.  I'm holding out for a while, it's just a blip.

Bitcoin won't,  when government creates a crypto and assigns it value and regulates it, that one might.  The fact is, everyone in BTC is placing their bets that the whales won't sell.  The other fact is, when the whales DO sell, they have enough impact to buy it back low and sell high, ad nauseum.  The big holders are banking off the little holders speculation.

Well it certainly isn't money because it has no fixed value.  An ETF pulling currency out of circulation could be a boon to stabilizing the price, and allowing semi fixed prices for products, allowing the potential for Bitcoin to be a currency, and not a lotto ticket.  But it still leaves the doorway open for value manipulation, and that is why it'll never be a currency.

I think you're mixing up decentralized with unregulated.  The fact that all of Bitcoins 'value' is measured in fiat means it is not a currency.  It is at best a commodity, but it's intrinsic value only lies in the fiat value applied to it by investors. 
A government run crypto currency would disrupt banking as we know it.  Centrally regulated, but in a proof of stake model(earning interest for those who secure the network) rather than proof of work, it would make it completely decentralized  as people are paid in it and pay with it. 
You use the term fiat like it is a bad thing, but Bitcoins goal is to become the next fiat.

I believe that is all it is...less than speculation, more like lotto ticket.

BTC will never truly be treated as a currency.  It's too volatile for one.  It doesn't have a monopoly of faith in it's intrinsic value.  The fact that that everyone is trying to move it to ETFs and the like, tells me it'll end up more of a security.  The thing is, it's a very limited security, and what you say about leverage and price manipulation by an ETF is very true and a very real possibility.

Because they hadn't yet learned that one investor could short circuit their entire investment

Coming the day one single whale manipulates the price with one order and drops it 20%?  Today is the day that crypto lost any chance of getting an etf in the us
