I think you’re projecting stances on me that I don’t hold. Your comment is a bit all over the place so I won’t try to hit all the points you’ve made in one go. If you’d like to have a conversation I’m game. 
Let’s start with the purpose of my first comment. It was in response to your remark that bitcoin has no intrinsic value. I simply pointed out that no money that people use as a means of exchange really does. The point of money is to simplify transactions. It’s easier for everyone to agree that some useless thing has X value than it is to exchange chickens and cars and PlayStation games for other goods or services. Whether a thing is visible or tangible really has no bearing in my opinion, as it’s the goods/services you acquire with it that have the real value. Do you disagree?
@_date: 2019-07-15 04:39:47
Predictions for the long term price of Bitcoin are a big joke too.

Is there such a thing as being too cautious with a potentially life changing amount of money?
@_date: 2019-07-20 15:58:58
I don’t. Just saying if true it would destroy the current price.
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:11:09
I definitely recommend getting a cold storage wallet, but that won’t be a solution to the problem you are describing. You’ll still have to transfer your crypto to an exchange to cash out.
@_date: 2019-07-30 20:20:48
Send me 3 BTC and I’ll get it back for you.
@_date: 2019-07-30 20:25:29
Lol. Good job, you’re catching on.
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:09:02
Ah. Well I would recommend doing a bit more research before diving into this game. The penalties for oversights can be steep. Anyway, I believe there are ways to verify if a wallet has been tampered with, but if it were me, I would cut my losses and junk it. Save for a new one and leave your crypto on a light wallet or exchange until you do.

If you bought a watermelon at a store for $5, then the next day you drove by a farm that sold them for $2, would you give up eating watermelon? I think you’d just buy from the farm in the future.

The bottom line is that nobody knows the right move friend. You just have to make a move with no regrets. If it works out, fantastic. If it doesn’t, you had no way of knowing, so carry on with life. If making multiple smaller purchases feel better, then do that. And after you do go give a hug to someone you love and remember that even if you lose that investment you still have your life, and the people that make it worthwhile.

No, because if you believed the value of bitcoin was going to go to 20k+, why would you spend it on things you can easily use fiat for when bitcoin is at $6500? There are plenty of folks that spent bitcoin early on just for the novelty of it, and they spent what would become thousands of dollars on pizzas and gift cards. It’s not that difficult to understand.

One negative aspect about bitcoin I don’t hear mentioned at all is the fact that you have to spend no small amount (depending of where you are) of money per month just to be able to be a use it. What happens if you can no longer afford internet access? There are still many people in the world that have limited or no internet access at all. 
For my family to all have phones with internet access and my home supplied with high speed internet I’m paying over $300 month. What if I suddenly can’t afford it? Bitcoin requires a monthly expense right? Or am I missing something?

Possibly, but the sooner I pay it off the sooner I can turn it into a rental and collect monthly rent so that’s an avenue to consider as well.
@_date: 2019-06-15 13:35:19
I don’t see that happening, at least not until crypto solves some problems with simplicity. Libra is going to be ultra simple for dummies to use, most people don’t have the interest to learn about hardware wallets, word seeds, sending test transactions to make sure you don’t lose all your money, stuff like that.
@_date: 2019-12-12 21:52:24
Absolutely. Only catch is I’ve just recently refinanced so legally I’m not allowed to rent it for 24 months I believe. They would have no way of knowing, but still.

That’s what I thought was the case. Not sure how anyone with any responsibilities can afford to be paid in crypto with this structure. Massive tax headache and possible 30% pay cut for capital gains...Crazy.

Of course, I should have clarified. Credit card/car etc vs. mortgage

Why would you organize a brigade of bad reviews on a company that did nothing wrong? You made the mistake, not them. You may be a kid, but you can act like a man and own it, then figure out a way to make it right. There’s almost always a solution, and sabotaging a company’s review score is not it.
Edit: I didn’t read the post closely enough, and this exchange does in fact need to present the customer with the KYC requirements BEFORE they allow crypto to be purchased.

Sounds like you need to step back and take a look at your life. Looking for excuses to be unethical is not the path forward for you. Blaming others for your mistakes is not the way forward either. 
I’m just a stranger on Reddit so I won’t lecture you on integrity and responsibility, but I will say that from a strangers perspective you paint yourself as a bit of a low life. Even your user name makes you sound like a hooligan. Deep down you know the way forward, but it’s a difficult path from where you stand now. Take it and earn the respect of your fellow man. Continue on the way you are and earn contempt. I hope you find your way.

There will always be poverty, because there is no such thing as equality of outcome, even if there is equality of opportunity. The reason for that, is that we are not all equal. If you think crypto or precious metals will somehow provide economic equality, you’re mistaken friend.

First off, there are no “experts” in bitcoin price predictions. They’re all guessing, and all full of shit. Make no mistake, what your friend is doing is gambling. Highly risky gambling at that. 
There is no guarantee that Bitcoin will ever clear ath much less $100k.

There’s no guarantee that it would skyrocket. It’s not even close to a proven system of currency for mass adoption, so it wouldn’t necessarily be the go to for folks in a crisis. I guess you could call me cynical, but I think of myself more as a realist. I like crypto, the idea and the technology, but let’s be real, it’s not ready for prime time yet.

Being “aware” of it, and understanding it are vastly different things (this may be mentioned in the video, I haven’t watched it yet). There’s quite a hurdle for average folks to clear to go from being aware, and knowing how to obtain, use, and secure digital currency. There’s a long way to go to streamline things for the general population.

I like George Carlin, but he’s a little further to the pessimist side than I. Still was a brilliant comedian!

The world is not ready for crypto to be the only money. The vast majority of regular people don’t understand it or how to secure it.

If you don’t want to impact the price of others crypto by selling yours, you are welcome to give it to me free of charge. That way nobody feels cheated.

If the French put 20% of their bank deposits into bitcoin they would collapse the banking system and lose the other 80% of their money....

Fookin’ droogs! 
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:46:54
That’s cool! I wasn’t aware their were internet providers that accepted bitcoin. Who do you go through? I’d be interested in looking into doing that myself!

Why would anyone take a video seriously when it has haunted house fonts all over it?

Then don’t drive or use any publicly funded resources or you’re just a leach.

Come on man, it’s okay to be excited by crypto and the alternatives it can provide without being delusional. The US dollar will be around for a long, long time to come.
