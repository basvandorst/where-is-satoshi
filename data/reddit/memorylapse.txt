[The IRS treats bitcoins received as income as income:](




So, no, you cannot legally claim capital gains on crypto received as income. OP is screwing himself out of being eligible for capital gains exclusions, or else he is evading taxes.

That's actually totally accurate. A supply curve represents the quantity people are willing to sell (supply) at any given price and a demand curve represents the amount people are willing to buy (demand) at any given price.
Where they meet is the equilibrium price. Whether supply and demand are stable are entirely immaterial to the concept. This is literally economics 101.

Yes, Microsoft and Apple have a great deal of what us real finance folks call "good will".
In essence, it's the part of their value that cannot be attributed to any of their income producing assets. It's the part of their value that is backed *by nothing*, and that was my whole point.

Yes, yes they are. But middle managers that want to impress their bosses are easily drawn into the hype, so you end up with corporations that have private block chains that would be better served by standard centralization and access/version controls.
All the drawbacks of decentralization with none of the benefits.
Google "distributed ledger technology". There are plenty of shyster consultants that would like to sell you it.

The computational power used in mining isn't what's backing Bitcoin, it's simply what's used to makes it tick. Computational power is what makes VISA tick too, but that's not where it's value comes from. You might have a point if you were able to capture that computational power, but as it stands, it is essentially wasted.
Bitcoin has no underlying asset. As it stands, it provides no utility except to people trying to get their money out from places with strict capital controls (China, anyone?). There is nothing to sell off if it goes to zero, unlike a corporation. It simply has value because people say it does--and unlike governments, markets have no ability to enforce the idea: the U.S. Government will only be willing to collect taxes in U.S. Dollars, they'll only be willing to buy fighter jets in U.S. Dollars and they'll only be willing to sell assets in exchange for US dollars. As long as the government of the United States exists, people will need US dollars. You cannot say the same thing about Bitcoin.

If the technology is what's valuable, why is Bitcoin more valuable than any of the other thousands of different coins?

Stores of value don't fluctuate by 50% in a week, just like your store of perishable food isn't 100 degrees one day and 36 the next.
"Store of value" is actually a finance or economics term that refers to an asset that is predictably valuable at some point in the future due to the stable value of its underlying assets. In the case of real currencies, that refers to the faith and credit of the government backing it.
There are examples where that faith and credit is no longer present and money becomes useless as a store of value--the late Weimar Republic, the Zimbabwean dollar, etc.

"Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should totally charter a private plane for a guy who has enough money to *buy* 100 private planes. This guy, with more money than Jesus, definitely needs random r/bitcoin users' help. It's our responsibility to defend the honor of this valiant multimillionaire, who is completely helpless without us. While we're at it, let's fill his neighborhood with a bunch of people in trench coats and fedoras and watch over him like guardian angels. If anyone comes up to his door? Accost them. Hell, shoot his mailman. ALL GLORY TO BITCOIN!"
You guys are hilarious.

This is an utterly ridiculous argument that grasps at the smallest of straws. Paying tax is different from hiring hitmen.

What US dual citizenship jurisdiction doesn't also have a tax agreement and/or extradition treaty with the United States? Tax evasion is a felony; they will haul your ass back here and then you're **definitely** going to need a lawyer.

If I lend my friend $100 and he uses that $100 for a special opportunity available only to him to make $1000, then gives you back your $100, you haven't paid anything. Other people getting wealthy does not make you any poorer.
If you really thought you could make money underwriting loans, why aren't you doing that right now?
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:12:04
Well yes, generally you would expect some kind of interest for lending out your money. The bank pays you to hold your money with services, and they also charge other people money for their services.
Personally, I would rather be given services by a bank than get nothing for holding it in a digital wallet, because--again--other people making money doesn't make me any poorer.

Entirely untrue. The entire basis of real GDP is that our real productivity is increasing constantly.
If you buy wood from a lumber yard and then turn that wood into furniture, both of you win. No one would ever make a transaction or trade if the utility of the thing they were trading for wasn't worth more than the thing they are trading away--hence, transactions for market value only have winners.
The economy is positive-sum, not zero sum. Open an economics book sometime.

Those who are paid a lower-than-minimum wage have agreed to the terms of employment with the understanding that their income will be supplemented by patrons. The employer does not have to increase their prices by 15% to compensate. It's like sales tax; it isn't rolled into the price but it may as well be. Rest assured, if people stopped tipping, prices would go up.
I get what you're saying. As a matter of principle, it seems funny that this one service in particular requires gratuities. Yet, that's the world we live in, at least in North America. I prefer it-it allows you to reward good service and punish bad service.
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:19:07
You're an asshole. Tipping is part of the price of eating out. It doesn't matter if you don't agree with it; you still pay it, just like your taxes.
