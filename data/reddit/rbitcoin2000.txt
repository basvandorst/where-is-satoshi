I totally agree with you
@_date: 2015-12-25 12:40:55
My best moment was reading your mail on a sunny Christmas morning!
@_date: 2017-02-08 12:47:52
Sorry, it was me. I had some money left and bought this morning some more Bitcoins. As always, shortly after that the price plunged ...

As I understood it, it is not allowed to operate Bitcoin-ATMs in Germany. You would need a BAFIN licencse.

Fees are not good!
Because there are many phantastic applications which are only possible with no or low fees. For example the Internet of Things (Iot): Machines are talking to other machines. They offer services which cost money. The payment must be fully automatic without any bank account. This makes only sense, if the services are very cheap (some cents or even only a part of a cent). But with high fees most IoT-application make no sense.
Other example: electronic payments in developing countries. Most people in these countries have no bank accounts but need to transfer (small) amounts of money. If they have to pay high fees, it makes no sense.

Payment channels are not available.
In Africa most people have a smartphone but ony few people have a bank account

Not with 1 MByte blocksize
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:52:56
Exchange 2MB with 16MB and we have a deal!
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:13:19
I give it up. To much stupidness.
@_date: 2016-06-30 14:08:12
And bitcoin is supposed to work with censorship to solve probelms?
Or insulting other people?
Or blocking?
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:16:59
It has already started crashing ....
Oh no, wait, ... moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon

I don't see any socks with Bitcoin-Logo. Can you add this?
@_date: 2016-12-08 10:25:16
A compromise can always help.
If Core would agree to increase the blocksize, many SegWit-blockers will change their mind ...

2020 would be a drop of nearly $5000
... uhhh you mean the year 2020 
@_date: 2016-02-24 16:34:27
This is cool!!
I have several questions:
Can it display also other currencies, for example Ether?
From which exchange is the price?
How often is the price updated?
Can the display be configured by the user?
Is it realtime?
@_date: 2015-07-14 09:46:06
When I buy a Bitcoin ETF, does the company that has issued the ETF also has to buy a Bitcoin (or a fraction of a Bitcoin)?
@_date: 2017-04-11 07:35:35
What will you do with the coins that will be not withdrawn?
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:24:39
At the moment I like to see BTC and Ether. But this could change in the future. If you add a configuration tool where I can select from different cryptocurremcies, I will definetly buy one.

First, I thought to buy the magazine to read the entire article. But then I read this bullshit in the introduction. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 13:49:02
2016 is not over yet ...
@_date: 2016-10-25 15:45:40
A bank will never (and is even not allowed to) trust a system, where most of all processing power is centralized in China and where the development is in the hand of a small group which is paid by a company

Input Current = 0.2A
0.2 * 220 = 44W
If it would use only 1W, I would buy five of this devices
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:02:48
1: 5$ - 260$
2: 60$ - 1200$

You will be a millionaire when bitcoin is higher than $36,124,597 
This will be not before 2025
@_date: 2015-10-11 08:50:18
Thank you very much !!!
@_date: 2016-10-17 07:39:05
Maybe it is because of the hateful fanatics of rBitcoin which are slowing the scalability process for politics. Technically it would be no problem for anyone to increase the blocksize but it is not imlemented.
@_date: 2016-05-17 14:23:28
True words. 
They closed my account without any explanation. Since I was really a very good customer, the only reason can be that I trade Bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-10-11 08:35:34
Here are some explanations for my intention: Of course, I do not expect that I get rich with this idea. I want to show that bitcoin enables many new ideas that were impossible to realize before. I never would print my bank account on my car. This would be too dangerous – but with bitcoin it is no problem.
The sticker is also a little bit too small. It is not easy to scan it while driving. Anyway, future cars (luxury cars have it already today) will all be equipped with camera systems to support driving assistance system. It would be easy to integrate a QR code detector in these systems. If I would have a “donate button” in my car I would also use it when I meet a friendly driver.
Finally yet importantly, this is a good promotion for bitcoin. At least some people will be curious what bitcoin is, when they see this sticker. Many people are still unaware of bitcoins.

Thank you very much !!!

The moderator asked me to blur the QR code. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 08:48:30
Thank you very much !!!

I was a taxi driver when I was a student. Now, it is a private car.
@_date: 2015-10-11 08:48:09
Thank you very much !!!
@_date: 2015-10-11 08:49:27
You are right. 
What would you write on the sticker?
@_date: 2015-10-11 14:08:51
Thank you very much !!!
@_date: 2017-07-14 07:43:37
Good ole times

The mod asked me to blur the QR code.
@_date: 2015-10-10 18:55:52
I made it in a Internet print shop. You can upload any image and define any size.
@_date: 2015-10-10 19:00:28
Ask the mod
@_date: 2015-10-11 08:50:29
Thank you very much !!!

The difference is: the Y2K-problem was fixed before it got a problem. The scaling problem of Bitcoin is not fixed and it is already a problem. And there is no solution in the near futere in sight. It is like the Y2K-problem was fixed not before 2005 ...
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:44:21
This is exactly how losers talk ...
I want to invest in the best coin and not into one that gets more and more unimportant!
