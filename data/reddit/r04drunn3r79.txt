Exactly, I just remembered and counted the BTC I lost in bad investments, wrong sell and buy moments, crazy giveaways and stupid spending.
You could buy a house for that, even with the current 'low' price. So yeah, anything above 100 USD isn't so bad.

What are you going to do with that?
Mine for Bitcoins?
You should have spend that money on buying Bitcoins.
If you would dissolved the hardware in acid and then melt it down, the gold you would get form that is worth more than the Bitcoins you would mine before your cards break down.
I hope you have a other purpose for that machine, otherwise this is going to be the worst investment ever!

"I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of  credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most  completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a  Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men". -Woodrow  Wilson.

No, Nigger is related to slavery. The correct term would be negro or more PC Afro-American.

@_date: 2016-12-01 12:54:27
Your reaction is so typically 'Gen Snowflake' or 'Millennials'.
Immediately you feel offended.  
That's why we call your generation Snowflake, because your generation feels really quick offended and you need concepts like 'safe space'. 
But you do realize that it is just a name given to a group of people born in a certain time frame. 
It's just a name for a generation, just like 'Gen X' , 'Gen Babyboomers', etc.

Let BFL run it self in to the ground. I'm done buying ASIC's from BFL.
It took those f*ckers a year to deliver.
Don't believe anything that ButtFingerLinking_Josh has to tell you. He is a Scam.
BFL is a SCAM. They took the money from early investors and then started to develop there ASIC products. They had no investment capital. That's why those F*cks took a year to deliver. Don't fall for the same SCAM with Monarch ASIC PCIe card. If you are lucky you might get it in June/July of 2014!!!!
BFL = SCAM!

ME : yes
**BFL: Did you try to use this in another order?**
ME : Thanks for quick reply.
     I have a voucher code BFL-IOS01xxx how can I use it?
     It tells me it's already used.
**BFL: Payment was not funded. BitPay must have logged you out after 15 min of inactivity. 
     Please place another order. That order is not valid anymore.**

Let me tell you a story.
Ones I was poor than rich and then poor again then rich again and poor again.
But, looking at the exchange rates we have now, I think I'm rich again :-)
So don't worry, Bitcoin is like a rollercoaster, sometimes it lets you laugh out loud and sometimes it almost makes you puke.  but in they end it's going to be worth the ride, so just enjoy it.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
