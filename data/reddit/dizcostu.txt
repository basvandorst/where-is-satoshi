Hard disagree. Why alienate those who may want to just try to use it as currency? Your reaction is based on the flawed assumption that every newcomer is a dummy who wants to buy BTC to get rich quick. You want growth? Get people in. Period.

I suggest looking into SmileTrain or similar organizations that provide surgeries for children with cleft lip and palate. My brother was born with a minor cleft lip, but thankfully with insurance and surgery in the US he is now an adult where it is barely noticeable. Children of lesser means and in poorer countries suffer lifelong both physically and socially from clefts. I think this would be a very worthy cause.
Thanks for doing this!

Maybe you're right but maybe it's just a correction to unsustainable ATHs. I'm not trying to time the market, just using it as a potentially higher yield supplemental savings account. If it tanks it just means it's a good opportunity to buy more for less. That's just me. I think there's a reasonable limit to how low the price will drop though. There are still a lot of eyes who could see 10k as a bargain after 17k. People willing to buy slows and reverses the fall

Tough to say. There's the FUD crowd and the shitpost Hodl crowd. Neither knows anything. Historically though it's pretty easy to say that the Hodl mentality makes money while FUD means panic sells and missed opportunity. If you're gonna buy just dollar cost average. Now's cheaper than 17k. Might even call it a bargain. Price should go up long term

Also by moving them to your wallet you are insulating yourself from panic selling it the price drops. It will take a little time to move back to the exchange and the trend could very well reverse. If you can't stomach peaks and valleys it's probably not a great vehicle for your money

What I do is use an Acorns account to do round ups whenever I swipe my cards. I also have a recurring withdrawal weekly. I basically use it as a staging area to track what I can afford to invest whenever I feel like buying BTC. Loose physical change is getting more difficult as fewer bank branches offer change counters. I just put it in a giant container and plan to deal with it at dinner point in the future. Probably just a long day of rolling coins. I also treat dollar bills as change. In a few years I should be able to go on a vacation. Of course, I'm losing money to inflation so I might switch it up and start putting it into crypto as well.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:22:44
No problem. This is from the coinbase site: "You can find your wallet address by navigating to the Addresses page or by clicking the Tools menu from the menu on the left." Copy the long string of characters - that's your public key. Go to blockchain.info and paste it in the search box. It should return the transactions that have occurred both to and from that address. You should see at minimum the transaction from Coinbase to your blockchain account wallet. If the transfer back from your blockchain account to the coinbase wallet was successful you would see a transaction as well (since you're not seeing it in coinbase, I doubt you'll see that transaction). You should also be able to see if there are any unconfirmed transactions.
You can do this same process with your blockchain account wallet - you should see transactions into and out of that wallet. Take a couple minutes, try it out, do some googling if you get really stuck. It's worth putting a little effort in for that kind of $ especially when btc keeps posting all time highs. Best of luck, I hope coinbase is able to sort it out for you!

If you're considering getting in, go for it but don't plan on playing the market. Just throw in whatever disposable money you'd normally blow on consumables like expensive liquor or impulse Amazon purchases when you can. Treat your wallet like a second savings account that's a pain in the ass to withdraw from which in this case is a good thing. If shit goes sideways it's not a big deal since that money was going out the window anyway. If shit works out you're definitely getting a better return than a savings account or probably your retirement investments.

Yeah, for sure. I wasn't trying to diminish your point. Since I was curious what $100 in 1929 is equivalent to I went and found the conversion. Since I put the effort in I figured I may as well post it so anybody else who was curious but too lazy to check could see it. Good original post, btw. Much appreciated

Get it fixed but for God's sake make sure it doesn't get wiped. Don't say Bitcoin at any point during the transaction. Get your coins and come back to this comment and update us. I wish more people would follow up

Keep this guy far away from any association with btc if you want mainstream adoption

Pretty sure the operator just has to nuke whatever creds the machine was using. I super duper doubt the machine has private keys stored on it

Dear bitcoin, please give me a head's up before you drop so I can put in a limit sell. Also, kindly give me warning at the bottom of the dip so I can buy back in and increase my meager holdings. Thank.

$30 profit? Or before you calculate electric cost? What's the expected breakeven point to recoup the cost of those two expensive cards?

It depends on which exchange you plan on using. Some have the ability to schedule buys on a timed interval, others have limit buys to purchase or sell when a certain price is hit.

I believe in order to withdraw you would need to link a bank account.

If you're really concerned about buying at a high, spread out your buys over a period of time. With $200 though, prepare to have Coinbase fees take a considerable bite out of that. Otherwise, just go with your gut and buy if you want to buy. Good luck.

Hope so.

I wish I had known this when BTC was $200. I thought it was too rich for my blood. Putting even $20 in would have been nice. Knowing myself, however, I would have pulled it out the first time it hit $1000 and paid expenses.

This kind of thinking is why adoption is still low. Average people associate Bitcoin to two things: crime and now getting rich quick. Traditional media can't help but mention ransomware, the silk road, etc when talking about BTC. Talking about tax evasion does not help. Pay your taxes. If you don't want to, that's on you, but personally I think it should be considered against sub rules to ask for advice on how to evade paying taxes

Keep going, finish up. Get a job and put your disposable income toward btc if you can. Education is important, despite what some say. You're less likely to complete later if you stop now. Your income potential will also be higher

That 1929 $100 would have been equivalent to about $1400

Honestly mostly out of curiosity and trying to expand my tech knowledge. I'm a developer but I don't have the same sort of drive that you see in rockstar devs. This genuinely interests me, so I'm running with it.

Not sure how we can expect adoption to increase when there's little confidence in the platforms used

I just think it's tacky. Good for you, anonymous millionaire. Go do some good in the world or stfu. That's my knee jerk to those posts. Sure, great, some average joes came into some wealth. Why exactly should I celebrate for them? They're not generously donating anything to me, someone who's time and again decided that I should put my money into paying down debt instead of putting large amounts into BTC. Of course, at a time like this, its easy to use hindsight and say that I would have had better returns putting my money into BTC but that's not the sort of play available to someone trying to start a family. If shit went sideways, as it often does, it would be all too easy to look at someone who put money into BTC instead of paying down debt as a gambler who made bad debt.
I dunno, I guess I'm just really salty that for years I looked at BTC and didn't get in for one reason or another. I have some in now, but 1000x returns aren't in the cards anymore. As the price increases, potential for really huge returns decreases.
Anyway, sorry for the rant, just blowing off some steam. There do seem to be more posts recently. Unsure if its conspiracy or just an influx of people bragging. I just know that the people I keep close in my life aren't the type to brag or talk about finances in general, so I'm pretty averse to it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:44:28
I agree that the price updates need to be related to a single sticky and all others removed. Last night was a cluster. Other than that, all I have to say is fuck BCH

I don't think there is an ounce of value in what you just said. It's the white noise of the deranged.

Your best bet (if you plan on buying a card for gaming as well) is to check out nicehash. You're not going to make anything solomining btc with a gpu these days. With free power, you could pay for the card sooner than without, but it will still take a while. Check out the calculator on their site.

I have no idea. I'm assuming in traditional markets this sort of move would be considered a no-no due to regulation. I would assume that Gemini/Coinbase wouldn't threaten the future of the market in the US by manipulating so overtly.

To buy more for cheap. Twice as much for the same price as now.

I bought btc awhile ago to pay for a VPN and had a few cents worth left over. Now it's 40 bucks. Then I promptly bought in. Not expecting that kind of return but i figure it's a long term savings account for a portion of my savings. I also started regularly withdrawing from my Acorns account to put into BTC, basically using it's transaction roundups to put into Bitcoin. Beats the 6% return I'm getting their "aggressive" profile. Little by little, fuck it, why not.
