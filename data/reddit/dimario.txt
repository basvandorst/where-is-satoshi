My cat just applied for that job.
Granted, he has subessential typing skills, so I helped him along a bit.
~~I~~ He can't wait to hear from the Googol.

Speculators will speculate.
I'm waiting for the markets to offer options to buy or sell options to buy or sell bitcoin for a certain amount of cash.
Kinda like a meta option.

I declare an *contradictio in terminis*.
The very nature of being intelligent is tied in with being able to follow,if not produce, abstract thought.
Also: 


Pray, regale us with the lecture you gave your little sister, and apparently for no reason withhold from us, the broader audience.
tl;dr: your're full of it. Put your money where your mouth is.

Once it starts, where will it end?
Kind of spelling it *banana* instead of *bana* or *banananananananana*
The possibilities are endless.

The problem with bitcoin is that it depends on many abstract concepts that cannot be precisely described accurately without knowing a whole lot of background.
"I'll trade you two ounces of gold for that fine looking horse" is a proposed transaction any one can understand.
"My mining operation found a key that confirms a certain sequence of pending transactions and makes them solidify" on the other hand, is not understood by anyone.
The whole concept of bitcoin is so unlike "normal" currency that it will take a more than average intelligence to grasp it.
The problem with "normal" currency is that there are many people out there who don't understand how that works either, hence crippling credit card debts.
