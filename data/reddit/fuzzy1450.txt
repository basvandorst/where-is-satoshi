Put yourself in a position where you have no government assistance at all. Then let's say someone sets fire to your house. Due to the lack of government, no one is coming to stop this criminal, nor is anyone coming to put out the fire. 
There are pros to a government. That's why we have one.

While that's all well and good, can you take a moment and look at what out government does for us that is good? I am aware that out government has bad aspects, but no world power can give us the world.

It's not that we are down voting due to an anti-bitcoin statement, or at least I'm not. I down voted him because he stated an absolute, with no evidence to support it.

Are you saying that if I kill a child, I will be a bad person? Blasphemy.

I've actually tried running the nodes of BU and Classic. Resource wise and setup wise, they were both just as easy. 
How does BU give large miners control of the mining barrier in a way different from Classic? In both cases, larger miners are able to gather incredible amounts of hashing power that the average enthusiast couldn't hope to match. Am I missing something here?

Of course. But was not praising every little thing that the government did. He was simply saying that the government did an OK job at providing necessities for basic life. i.e. government organizations.

This is very poorly written and sounds like a rant more than someone trying to make a point. You don't offer any solid proof of anything you claim, you just define what your points mean. "BU is anti-decentralist because it is." is circular logic. I don't make any conclusions on the BU debate because I don't know the facts. This rant has not help me learn any facts.

You don’t have to take his word for it. I didn’t say that. Just look at everything going on around trump. There are a large amount of very powerful and affluent people making a concerted effort to unveil some kind of dirt on trump, and they have failed for 2 years. 
The notion that they couldn’t find something but Assange could is wildly misguided.

Barr seems to be the one trying to “bury” the report, and I’m not sure why. It seems to have exonerated trump, and it doesn’t seem like muller disagrees with the report. 
And he’s probably trying to hide his tax records because he exploited some loophole, like every millionaire+ does. I don’t think that’s a shock anyone. 
I’m not saying there isn’t dirt on trump. I’m just saying that none of it is a shock. He’s a millionaire sleezebag who bragged about grabbing women by the pussy. Everyone has known this forever. The people who voted for him knew this.

Considering that trump has had 92% negative media coverage, and it’s been happening 24/7 for the past 2 years, along with the fact that he’s suspect to numerous investigations, I think it’s safe to assume that any dirt that could be found on him has been found.

They said they didn’t leak anything about trump because everything they had on him was already public knowledge.

Slight typo, I had thought the market cap would be at 21 Billion, and not million.
