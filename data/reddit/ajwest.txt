Is it possible to make a deterministic redeem script mnemonic? I want to make a 2 of 3 multisig paper wallet, but the complex redeem script has to be saved too and that kind of defeats the purpose of the mnemonic.
If you don't have the redeem script you have to "know the order" or there's always some other caveat. I would very much like to see a new BIP rooted in solving this "redeem script problem" (a term I just shamelessly made up).
@_date: 2016-04-06 23:03:37

I agree with you in general, this is an early (first) release and there are more features to come. You make it seem like OB is meant to be some sort of under layer for other software, but I thought it was literally the frontend solution for P2P online stores. The "bottom layer" is Bitcoin isn't it?

@_date: 2016-04-22 16:21:32
I thought it was that people couldn't withdrawal their cash fiat (withdrawals delayed indefinitely by Mtgox) and so they traded for Bitcoin hoping they could get something out of the exchange. When everyone started doing that and nobody wanted the fiat currencies (because it seemed Mtgox might not send it to their bank), the Bitcoin became more scarce and value went up.

And the word "Coinbase" is also term in the context of this technology, so the "BLOCKCHAIN!!!!" argument still applies there to some degree. I don't think it's insidious though, it's just annoying to feel the need to clarify the differences between the company's name and the technological concept.

Same here but I used [these punches]( with a hammer to have my private key (WIF) "written in stone" on a piece of aluminum I found at a craft store. If I took a picture of the plate it would defeat the purpose, but here it is before I inscribed the keys: 
@_date: 2016-04-06 22:03:08
Thanks, that [was suggested]( to me by but it's also been said this could be a tiny security risk (ie. if quantum computers become an actual thing). I think I'll risk it and spend a tiny bit of BTC from the multisig so I can just forget about the darn redeem script. I will rest easier knowing that I have all my keys and the ability to send the funds than I would worrying about a far-fetched attack vector.
@_date: 2016-04-27 03:17:59
I am in awe at how the miners continue to be so benevolent by refunding these obviously erroneous fees. The culture of Bitcoin is vastly misrepresented by the big players arguing; this isn't the first time we've seen such a large sum of money returned to the original (stupid) owner.
@_date: 2016-04-04 02:58:15
A little off topic but since I know you're a mnemonic guy, do you have any advice for how to store a multisig as a paper wallet that way?
I want to make a 2 of 3 multisig wallet, giving a piece to my parents, a piece to my brother, and a piece to save myself. [From my understanding]( I have to keep the redeem script somewhere safe too.
But now that I have to save a really long redeem script, it sort of defeats the purpose of the easy-to-remember mnemonic, doesn't it?

My highschool was named an acronym called NKEC. Northeast Kings Education Centre. We lobbied to have people refer to it as "N. E. K." but the masses overruled and to this day 10 years later call it "Neck Eck." This is what I think about when I see people pushing the BCash, BCore or anything other than the community's usage. The point is, we have no choice, people actually involved in using Bitcoin Cash will use the words that they use and we need to stop wasting our effort trying to convince people how to refer to things.
For example, the word 'marijuana' is politically incorrect but how would we possibly get people to only call it 'cannabis?'

That's not true at all, the Lightning network is perfectly secure and uses cryptographic/signed proofs to make sure you can't just steal or otherwise "attack" the funds you have on that network. I detest this whole scaling solution but we are not more vulnerable to attacks by using it.
The problems people have with Lightning is the chance of centralisation, the continued need for a larger blocksize, the fees required for opening/closing, and ultimately the upfront cost of "adding funds" into a channel.

As an Android developer working on a free-to-play game, I would absolutely love to accept Bitcoin for my hard-currency purchases. However, given that my game is pretty much forced to be integrated with Google Play Services (for sign-in, push notifications, and ultimately marketing by virtue of listing on their store) I am bound by their Terms of Service which clearly states how digital goods must be purchased through the in-app payment flow and does not allow BTC as a form of currency.
In this case, my only recourse is to make another version without Play Services integration (in addition to the Play Store version) and republish the app somewhere it can be downloaded and installed directly. This then requires the user to enable the "Install from unknown sources" checkbox and seems much more sketchy when I'm offering my game to people.
I should also mention the significance of recreating a way for users to provide their credentials, which is possible but it's more work and yet another flow/logic to learn and figure out how to implement. If I wanted to allow micro-transactions with traditional credit cards in this 2nd non-Play Store version, I would need to find a payment provider (or just leave this other version as bitcoin payments only).
TL;DR: I would love to, but I'm just one man with too few resources for this to be worth it in my target demographic.
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:33:25
Well to be honest I don't think I'm underestimating the income I would get from it, surely I can't expect much from my lone little app (especially having an alternate download link and purchase-flow specifically for accepting Bitcoin payments).
With that being said, I would concur that the general proliferation of Bitcoin-optional games is "worth" something and it continues to flutter at the back of my mind as a member of the community.
Ideally, Google Wallet would allow transactions in BTC and I wouldn't have to do anything at all.

Yes that has been suggested and I will add Segwit labels soon.

I made this Preferred Miner proof of concept site and it does "work" in that I do collect transactions and petition miners to take them, and there is an API they can check for pending transactions... But if you're getting at the issues we've been discussing, it's true that the service isn't very practical, mostly due to the fee requirements.
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:15:08
That's the spirit! However, it was pointed out that a miner will have a slight extra risk when they accept these transactions for inclusion in their found blocks, basically working out to 5-10 times the required fee just to offset the risk. See [comment here.](
@_date: 2017-02-01 15:12:29
Yes exactly, and when blocks are always full,  on the list below isn't going to happen.
From when [I first posted Preferred Miner](






@_date: 2017-02-01 16:31:56


I'm a little confused by the question, OP simply posted my Preferred Miner website again... nothing has changed about the reality of the situation as I again described above.
@_date: 2017-02-03 13:28:44
Sure but in the context of this comment thread, Segwit is not the scaling solution, it just happens to have an effective block size increase.
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:11:45
Oh I like the idea!
You create and sign a transaction, then broadcast it and switch to the role of a miner where you look for the block and include the transaction, then the next person gets the outputs which are essentially reagents to make a new transaction.
@_date: 2017-02-01 14:54:00
I think this is kind of funny because when I released the website I posted it on and but the crowd [was very supportive with ideas, had tons to say and even a miner came in to explain some nuance](
So to see it posted again here in with primarily Segwit supporters, and then had Bitcoin Unlimited supporters, I think this is a beautiful illustration of the community split we've got going on over this scaling issue.
@_date: 2017-02-01 14:47:47
I made this Preferred Miner service, and while it 'works' in that I am actively collecting transactions and will try to get them processed by your preferred miner(s), it's still kind of impractical. A few people have discussed the possibility of adding 'broadcast to preferred miner' feature in Electrum as a plugin, but even still the reality is that these transactions must include something like 5-10 times the fee before the miners will even consider including them under normal financial incentive. Perhaps the political message of "hey I'm trying to support this miner" will have a few of them accept the extra effort (and apparently there is some extra risk in missing out on a mined block from network requests).
Really this is more a proof of concept to discuss the idea of treating miners like service providers, pointing out how little say we have as bitcoin end-users, and thus far it has been a huge success in spurring these conversations.

I think the counter-argument is that we still have to process the spam transactions, which takes legitimate work by the miners.*


Well technically all 'legitimate users' can make transactions even during a spam attack; the problem lies with the speed at which the network can clear them because we can only fit 1mb worth of the latest transaction history into each block.
*That said, even the spam transactions should have been posted with fees, so it's not the craziest idea in my opinion... miners can just ignore the crappy transactions with less than a few satoshis (or whatever a realistic fee is these days).

Hey, that's a clever 'backup' solution, I'd like to do that! Thanks for your response, but now I have one followup question because this [Paper Bitcoin Wallet]( service says:
*"Plan on importing your entire balance. Afterwards, discontinue using the paper wallet—as if you were breaking open a piggy bank. If you try to spend or withdraw only a portion of your funds, you risk losing the remaining balance forever."*
Why is it important to transfer all the funds, and does this mean I shouldn't make even a small outgoing payment from the multi-sig wallet (as a means of backing up the redeem script) like you suggested?
@_date: 2017-02-01 14:59:32
Are you on mobile? It's not really made for mobile but it's a fair point; that font is huge. I was trying to make it very easy and step-by-step based.
As you might have seen me mention elsewhere, the service is kind of a proof of concept so I don't think I'll spend much more time on this unless there is a glaring new reason people want to start using Preferred Miner en mass or it becomes cheaper (less required fees) for miners to include these ‘private’ transactions in their mined blocks.

It came up on a [question I asked about multisig wallets]( Then I read more about it...
Quantum computers can find factors of numbers in a way that doesn't totally suck like today's conventional processors. Encryption works because we take long prime numbers and add some fancy exponents, so it ends up being impossible to figure out how to turn the information back into something useful. Quantum computers however, can find these huge prime factors, making many of the encryption methods we use today obsolete. In fact, with enough money you can probably rent a quantum computer (and a team) to factor something for you.
You want this article: 
When you make a wallet, you are generating a privatekey which is used to make a publickey which is used to make the wallet address. When you make a transaction, you have to sign it with your private key so the network will agree that the funds have been transfered (network sees that the math checks out). That process permanently inscribes in the blockchain your signed transaction (as designed), but the fear is someday you would be able to take that transaction and determine the private key through something like the factoring I discussed above. To avoid this problem, you simply generate a new address and move all the funds for every transaction or right after.
TL;DR: To quantum-proof your Bitcoin, the funds are safe at any address you control until you post an outbound transaction (you send any amount of Bitcoin to anyone). So if you have spent BTC but still have some left at that address, simply make a new address and send them there for safe keeping. When you spend some more, repeat the process.

I love this idea! As a laymen I've been following along for the past ~year, but this is the first time I have actually understood and agreed with the proposal.

Is it truly non-gameable? I can see a horde of critics finding some corner case where they might suggest miners will work together to make smaller blocks or something else to do with this proposed 1.5  hard limit multiple 'voting' system.

I agree that sidechains are analogous to an intranet, but I'm not sure why you added "that is not connected to the Internet" on the end of that thought. Intranets, like sidechains, aren't necessarily designed to be 'off the internet' and I don't think a sidechain *could* be completely sandboxed into a specific network and remain successful.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:37:37
It really works in that I am actively collecting transactions and try to get the miners to take them, but there has been a lot of feedback which pokes holes in the feasibility of the service. Mainly that the transaction propegation time adds more risk of orphaning your recently-mined block considering the transactions aren't already in mempool and you have to send them around to nodes for confirmations, which takes only a tiny second but is enough to make the required transaction fee something like 10 times that of a mempool transaction.
@_date: 2016-01-12 19:21:38
OP I'm sorry that the only answers you've received have been "Don't store bitcoins in Coinbase" which I don't think addresses your question. You're worried about the recent news regarding Coinbase having been removed from the 'recommended' list on bitcoin.org, which was recently reverted and everyone is now friendly again.
You will not have a problem buying Bitcoin with Coinbase and the functions for transferring bitcoin (to yourself or other bitcoin wallets not in Coinbase) all works very well and is used by thousands of people and businesses daily.
The key wisdom this subreddit tries to express is that you don't control your bitcoin if you leave it in the wallets of these services. Over the past 3 years we've seen really crazy stuff happen to people's bitcoin when they don't "take it out" of the exchange and store it in new wallet(s) created with Bitcoin software you control and trust yourself. For example, if you bought bitcoin from the exchange *MtGox* and didn't transfer them to your own wallet, you may have fallen victim to a big theft where the CEO took everyone's Bitcoin and ran off. He's in jail now, but the point is that he wouldn't have been able to do that if everyone controlled their own wallet keys.
Coinbase is one of the largest and most regulated services (and is much more than a simple 'exchange') in the US, and I don't think you'll see any similar funny business. The reasons the company was removed from bitcoin.org was purely idologically/political... and it doesn't really matter anyway because only a few people control that website (versus bitcoin as a protocol which is controlled by everyone).
Ideologically people don't like Coinbase because it seems 'centralised' and they necessarily collect personal information for anti-fraud. Some people (including you?) want to stay completely anonymous, so obviously this service isn't good for that considering the US Government could subpoena your account information or use other means to connect your wallet address to your person.

Google Alerts told me to come here because you mentioned my website Preferred Miner. It's legitimate and I'm collecting transactions, but your preferred miners won't be processing them in a very short period of time, possibly never. Use this service if you're interested in expressing support for a specific miner or pool, but not if you're​ hoping to actually have the transaction processes in any reasonable timeframe.

If we're making a feature wishlist, I'm sure we would all add a few.
I want the intricacies of addresses to be less overwhelming. Change addresses, private and public, sweeping keys... I hope someday people won't have to learn about these concepts or they somehow become more obvious to new users.
I suppose this points to the overall problem of user education and in-turn user adoption. I have a hard enough time explaining to people the base concept, let alone hardware wallets, multisig wallets, paper wallets, how to store, how to encrypt, how to do your taxes, why you should care, etc.

That's not even true, Coinbase [recently posted]( that they're deliberately going to start distancing themselves from wallet services. They don't need to compete in that space, and why should they? They've got people *buying* Bitcoin through them and they're taking a cut, which is much more than a centralised wallet service.
Coinbase has shown time and again that they support Bitcoin as both an investment and as a transfer of value. They've done huge work forming industry opinions and if you ask me, they deserve the market share they've created.
Centralised wallets are a byproduct of a solid service. I have a few satoshis in my [chopcoin.io]( account too, it's just a situation right now where people leave their wallets in the services they use.
@_date: 2016-01-07 21:35:16


No to both. Did you read the article? I'm not even very well read on the subject and I understood the proposal.
BitPay wants to make it so miners can choose how big the blocks are, but they [miners] need to stay within 1.5 times (or whatever ratio we agree) the average size of the previous blocks. That way miners can make their blocks a little bigger or smaller to their taste, and they still get an overall say on the size by choosing. Naturally, the average size from the previous x blocks will be dynamic over time. In this sense you could consider it "unlimited" in that the block size will increase forever (as is expected regardless) but there is a dynamic limit which will increase in response to Bitcoin's transaction volume. This way we don't have to guess how big blocks will need to be down the road because blocks will be based on the average size of the previous blocks.

Actually my game is free-to-play, with optional purchases for players. In-app purchases must be implemented through the Play Store if the user downloaded it from the Play Store. I am happy to host my own APK for free, it's more about how to charge people for in-app items. Right now I'm using the Play Store as a payment provider, but for the version I host myself I need to implement a different payment provider (like PayPal) alongside bitcoin purchases. Or as I said, I could just have this version be "bitcoin" formatted and be done with it; offer the same functionality but if you want to pay with Bitcoin you just have to download the version from my website instead.
Google Play Services handles charging creditcards well, and it's got a lot of people with their card information already willing to buy small units. It's all just a lot to do when the app idea and design itself needs countless more hours of work, I don't have as much time to fool around with bitcoin as a payment option in an ecosystem that doesn't support it yet.
If people have other suggestions, I'm all ears. Maybe Google will read this discussion and begin working out a solution...

Thanks for your reply, it's nice to be acknowledged and I appreciate your warm feedback. I'll try to add SEGWIT labels this weekend because I agree that's a thing people want. That said, it is just a proof of concept (although the site works and is sincere) and nobody has really submitted transactions anyway so I don't think that's an urgent addition.

To me that's a real 'fee market.' When I broadcast a transaction, I expect to compete with the realworld availability of computing resources. I really don't get how everyone here is so libertarian yet they want to artificially withhold my ability to negotiate with miners whatever amount I want to pay for the transaction (by capping their ability to process the transactions).
Why do people like care if miners make 1 or 25 cents off of me? It feels like it's none of anyone else's business; as far as I'm concerned if there are a million transactions and somebody feels it's worth it for them to process all of them, just let them do it (they're pending transactions, that's what miners do!!!). If the total fees don't cover the cost, then the miners won't include the transaction and I'll have to pay more if I expect somebody to accept my transaction.
When I read the whitepaper it really seemed to me like the idea has always been supply/demand of computing resources... what we have now is the same thing but with an extra limitation messing up the whole plan, so now instead of supply/demand of computing resources it's supply/demand of blockspace.

Well I already did that, and it works in production as you see. I admit this is a useful feature (can we call a label a feature?), but as it stands you can find the miners signaling Segwit yourself (it's not like you're unable to select only Segwit signaling miners).


There have been 4 BU mining pools and they are very explicitly supporting Bitcoin Unlimited. Until recently there were quite a few pools who were 'ready for Segwit' but did not yet start signaling. I don't know the intricacies behind why there were so many more 'Segwit supporting' pools than 'Segwit signaling' pools, but either way let me stress that people aren't using this site for other reasons; whether or not I add a label for Segwit miners probably isn't going to change the reality of the situation. I'm happy we're discussing the concept, that's why I made the website, but after all the feedback I've gotten I just don't see this service being a viable long-term way to express end-user political support for BIPs unless people are willing to pay 5-10 times the fees, which we know they probably won't.
That said, *yes ok everyone can stop tweeting at me because I will add Segwit labels.*

Well you weren't the only person to suggest that, and it's still a good idea but it's just hard for me to manage who's signaling what. Bitcoin Unlimited miners are obvious and easy to label. Not to mention the fact that people won't actually use this service in practice considering the various pitfalls discussed in the [other thread when I originally posted it](
If people use the service I will begin tracking and labeling all the miners signaling for Segwit. Until then, it's just a proof of concept and that's a waste of everyone's time if nobody even wants to submit transactions and miners don't seem to want to accept them.
@_date: 2016-06-03 04:33:51
I don't know that just sounds like an example the person was using to illustrate something that could be powerful. We could poke holes in any idea.

Hey I'm the creator of this proof of concept site and that's totally the idea!

@_date: 2017-01-31 14:29:17
I am the creator/operator, the site was just released this month so there aren't actually very many transactions that have been submitted yet. But basically for now I just send the transactions to the preferred miners in an email. I have an API if a miner ever wants to collect them more regularly and automatically, but I don't think we'll see that happen unless people adopt the service in greater numbers. You should read through the [comments from when I first posted]( it because I think the discussion is interesting.
@_date: 2017-01-31 13:12:48
I even emailed a few and got some supportive comments, just no formal commitments to accept the transactions. If you can collect a bunch of transactions with a super high fee, I'll certainly petition your preferred miner(s) to process them.

Yet *another* example of Luke omitting the whole story and labeling the situation as "a lie."
Segwit2X has legitimate people working on it as a scaling solution and *their* intention was always to upgrade the Bitcoin network with this plan. That intention has nothing to do with Luke-jr or an altcoin. It would seem Luke does not like the plan, but instead of explaining anything, he said it's "a new alt-coin" and "a lie." It certainly could become an "altcoin" by his definition if people don't go along with it, but that hasn't been determined yet and the project is interested in scaling Bitcoin itself (not an altcoin).
Plans change, or maybe those developers won't even care about it anymore, but it's morally wrong to say that they are lying or working against Bitcoin. It's also wrong to imply that they intend to produce an altcoin (especially for the purpose of securing a specific ideology).
Replying to Luke's comment for context to future readers, as I believe this is an explicit "tactic" he takes against the spirit of informed and educated discussion.

I feel ya. When I was 13, I played a Half-Life mod called 'Stargate TC' (surely long dead now) and it was so small that there weren't a ton of maps to play. Living in rural Nova Scotia down a long dirt road, we had dial-up, but thankfully my parents didn't balk at long hours using the family computer. I made 3D environments all day and night one summer for that mod, finally playing them with my one friend I could convince to log on and join my public game server.
Back then I think I would compile the map to a .bsp file or something and clients would download directly from my computer as I was hosting the server. But since there were so few official maps for the game, when somebody saw a new one in the list of game servers, they would naturally join to check it out.
Woah, I don't think I had ever seen so many people online in the same server at once. There were probably a dozen people playing in my ~2mb map they miraculously downloaded at the start, by one or two people, from my dial-up connection. The re-sharing of my map allowed others to join my game (I would never have been able to upload it to so many players). To me, that was the epitome of what has since become everything; this something was important to people, valued, communal, downloaded and maintained by each other, etc. Then came torrents, now we're at cryptocurrency - you (in particular of all people) know the story.

I'm sorry but I don't agree with either of your suggestions. You most definitely should not leave your coins on any service or exchange unless you are actively using that service for something like trading or any number of reasons *other* than holding your Bitcoin long term.
As for how to do that, a paper wallet is a good suggestion in general but it's probably easier and safer to use one of the multisig wallets which provide a mnemonic set of random words you can back up on paper in a safe place. With a normal paper wallet I always worry people are going to keep putting money on it and then someday try to spend only a subset of the coins. As we all remember, it's important to spend *all* your money from an address (don't reuse addresses) and there are many stories on this subreddit of people accidentally giving the miners a huge fee instead of using a change address. All this to say, use Electrum or any of the various [other multisig wallet software options.](
@_date: 2016-12-07 18:45:49
Well there are two issues really, the first is kind of an optional quasi-privacy one, which you're not really solving if you keep using the same address even if only for incoming transactions. The second issue is a bigger deal but more of a "future" problem, where if you've sent Bitcoin from any address the signed transaction becomes part of the blockchain. Today that's not an issue, but it has been suggested that some day quantum computers will have the power to take that signed transaction and calculate the private key used to sign it, thereby giving that person access to any remaining funds in the address.
So it's important to make a new address for incoming transactions if you don't want people to be able to figure out your net worth. But it's even more important when you spend funds to spend *all* bitcoin in the address, sending any excess to a new address (people sometimes refer to that as a 'change address') and never using the original address ever again.

@_date: 2016-11-20 07:36:52
I see where you're coming from with most of those concerns, but isn't a coloured coin managed by a central body? Ie. Stock splits and dividends are just a matter of the entity running the coin saying "ok, everyone with 1 now has 2." But also, why would you need to stock split something with so many decimal places? Stock splitting is only really done to lower the entry point so people don't get priced out of being able to buy, it creates liquidity by allowing stock owners to sell portions of their position instead of necessarily selling a huge chuck of value. With crypto you just sell 0.5 instead of 1.0 which is essentially the same thing as a stock split. Wanna split again just make it 0.25.
As for the income payments it's obviously going to differ entirely by country, but it's not totally crazy to do what you're suggesting (automatic tax payment to government).
TL;DR: Colored coins are not decentralised in the same manner as Bitcoin, they are by their nature designed for these types of applications with different rules set by the issuing organization.

That's a very subjective statement. *You* are the one who decides who is making a rational argument? I've read tons of very valid (what I consider valid I guess) criticism. I'll give three from memory: 1) Witness data treated differently and given an arbitrary number, 2) the fact that people have to actually use/implement SegWit for a considerable benefit, and 3) the fact that it's not a hard fork (not as "clean" of a change).
Now I'm not suggesting there aren't counterpoints to these concerns, and feel free to express them, but ultimately I do consider these to be more than "a single valid rational argument against SegWit."

I am not a member of the Bitcoin Unlimited team, but I feel the need to respond to this possibly misleading statement for anyone else reading this thread now and for the record. Bitcoin Unlimited clients currently work on the same Bitcoin blockchain we all know and love; it is not another coin or "altcoin" as Luke-jr just stated.
The "political attack" as he calls it, is some new proposed features which Bitcoin Unlimited hasn't developed into their client, and a differing viewpoint on the implementation of these features. Now you can decide if that's a political attack or not.

Nobody knows all the users, that's why "knowing people" isn't used as a metric in studies. I was never speaking to the other point but the rest of what you are saying seems reasonable to me. Segwit without 2x does work right now you're right.

Surely we can (as a community) create a "checkpoint" hash where we've all agreed to independently verify all transactions up that point. Maybe there's a yearly or monthly publication vetted by various organisations who we can trust (together, not individually of course). If Core, Coinbase, Kraken and a few developers all told me, "You can start with prune x, which we've verified to have the known hash of y" then I would easily accept that over checking all transactions.

I like it, it's a nice alternative to [Vanitypool]( and easier than using your own computer with the [Vanitygen software](
That said, I've found Bitcoin enthusiasts (people who want vanity addresses) often have many computers around the house and are patient people. I actually started ['pooling' together]( my own computers.
OP, I'm curious as to how you're mining the addresses. Is this just a VPS going at it or do you have some cloud computers doing the searching? I thought about launching Google Cloud instances to do the same thing (perhaps even with the option to choose how many instances to throw at the problem for a proportional fee), but it seems you need to use GPU rather than CPU or just don't bother because it's something like 10-20 times faster. I don't know enough of the details of which service would offer to scale that properly on GPU or similarly appropriate hardware with olcvanitygen, but when I use my CPU I can generate about 2.3 million addresses per second versus my rather old GPU generating over 25 million per second. In conclusion, it seems only worth it to do this work using a GPU and cloud computing companies don't appear to have that as an option.

Maybe we'll see reputations emerge. Do you use Gmail or Yahoo? Do you want your SPV to wallet to use Coinbase or Kraken?
But there is always a thread in the Bitcoin mailing list about how to create incentives for node operators, so maybe something will happen to get that idea more attention. For example, if a node has collected 5 BTC worth of gratuities, I'd probably trust it over one without.
@_date: 2016-10-26 21:18:26
Plus even if they are mining solo, doesn't it still accomplish the 'goal' laid out by the OP? If the idea is to decentralise mining with these and we don't care about block reward, then everyone running solo vs pooled doesn't really matter because the hashrate is the same regardless. If the device costs over a thousand times more than the reward you'd get by running it for a year in a pool, then there's no incentive to join a pool anyhow.

You already posted that link, but the current situation doesn't really mean much. The only thing I agree with here is that there would be less hash power on the minority chain.

If that's not a sufficient security model for you, then by all means you don't have to use it.

That person ideologically disagrees with the RBF function at the Bitcoin protocol layer, and suggests boycotting Electrum for implementing (beginning to implement) tools to use the feature. Remember, Electrum developers do not control the protocol, they're just trying their best to follow it.

@_date: 2016-05-20 17:25:59
I notice you asked for more info in another sub too so I'll give the quicky overview.
Fees are required to send Bitcoin. The miners prefer to process the transactions where they will collect the highest fees. Bitcoin protocol currently only allows a miner to process 1MB worth of transactions when they mine a block, and so we call this the "Blocksize." Obviously this means lower fee transactions will be processed last, and in many cases are pushed to the next block or otherwise aren't processed in a timely manner. A transaction with 0 fee is valid, there's just no incentive to process it and it'll probably stay in the pool of pending transactions (called mempool) until it's processed (or dropped).
It seems like it would be useful to increase the fee for a 'stuck' transaction due to a low fee (miners don't want to include it in their block because other transactions are worth more to them and they only have 1MB of space to work with).
Replace-by-fee simply allows a user to rebroadcast that transaction with an additional fee, making it more likely that a miner will include it in their next block. This is now recently possible and so wallets like Electrum have started to implement the front-end UI to do this action.
The controversy is two fold:
1. Blocksize could be increased and we wouldn't have to fight (as much) over which transactions are priority, because more would fit into a block. Some people don't want to do this because they think a 'fee market' is important (ensuring miners continue to make money from fees for processing transactions).
2. RBF, depending on how the user messaging works in the wallet software, might not be explicit enough for some people to realise that their incoming funds could be respent or what we call a "double spend" by the sender with a higher fee to a different address.
Basically that user doesn't believe we should be allowed to renegotiate a transaction after it has been broadcast, for fear of people not realising they don't necessarily completely "own" the funds yet.

KNC is still finding blocks as of right now.

I had about $1000 CAD in there that I was trying to withdraw at the time. How would that work for me?

No that's not true, it's so easy! I'm the creator of this video and I really didn't spend much time on it at all, it's just dragging stuff around and looking up how to script little pieces at a time. Unity is way easy compared to Unreal Engine in my opinion, I honestly believe anyone could learn it.

You brought up the subject of a post, didn't give a title, and then didn't even provide a link to the one you were talking about when asked. But hey, we should all Google everything you say, right?

"Buy another coin..." "Make his own chain..." that's exactly what he's doing though. Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork; you can choose too.

I felt the same way, but to be fair:
1. The actual site is slow right now, probably because it's being DDOSed by everyone watching.
2. The stream has a live chat, some people enjoy that.
3. YouTube works as a dedicated app on streaming devices like Chromecast, and I don't know about your computer but I find the site eats a ton of RAM.
4. The stream overlays prices and charts in multiple currencies.

If I were to download a Segwit block, how big would it be? Before any processing of the data, how many literal bytes are there to download (assuming the block is full of transactions)?

What can we do to get into this as a hobbyist? I just want to break even or take a tiny loss so I can say "I mined this bitcoin" or otherwise have participated in the random search of a block here or there.
Is solar the answer? Can I put a mining rig on my bicycle? I'm not the only one who feels like they missed out on the all the mining fun.

The difficulty period will adjust, and they'll (BCC) be able to mine just like anyone. Plus you don't mention the fact that these miners aren't competing with the full Bitcoin network worth of miners, so even if they take a while to find a block, it's not as though there are tons of other miners searching to scoop up the next one.

What do you mean by "could minimise the risk?" What is the risk if we add a transaction size limit?


But [then you also note](


And in any case, miner policies typically reject any transaction over 100k.

I mean there are tons of people, myself included, reporting that their withdrawals are working fine on various currencies. I don't doubt that your experience may vary but it's not looking like insolvency.
Edit: I just got 2 confirmations on my 2+ BTC withdrawal right now.

This sentiment seems a little silly, you can and always could provide a fee. Also the miners are still making the block reward these days, there's no reason to feel bad about some dudes with server farms who are *choosing* to include your 0-fee transactions.

...and it's not socialism at all, I don't know why all these political spectrum affiliations are being brought up out of the blue. I [responded to a few Libertarians]( yesterday who seem to think Bitcoin should only be used by people like them.

That person is clearly just framing the argument in a way which makes it seem like the burden is on exchanges to submit to his idea of a valid block.

I think everyone is enthusiastic about block chain features to a certain extent. I love smart contracts, I want Bitcoin to have that. I think Monero has the right idea too we could use some of that.
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:23:55
Well you "found" 6 BTC, where did you find them? Are they in an Electrum wallet, a file with a bunch of numbers, some other client or password protected file? Etc...
