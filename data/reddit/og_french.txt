Great news for ICO Fraudsters and crypto scammers: you can now use the very same crypto you stole as bail! 
@_date: 2019-03-18 19:04:23
Actually, 2gether has the lowest fees in the space compared to it's competitors!  
@_date: 2019-03-18 16:52:07
You can read more about the 2GT presale on Bitcointalk: 
I'm happy to help you guys out with any questions you might have :)
@_date: 2019-03-19 06:55:07
And what do I don't get bud, please explain it to me so I can learn something valuable!
@_date: 2019-03-19 12:03:46
Bitcoin is already being supported on 2gether by the way 
@_date: 2018-10-04 06:51:24
I understand your concern but don't instantly jump on the spam &amp; scam mobile. ParJar's sensitive information is on a secure and offline database. It's server is using an API to connect with Telegram, but your bitcoin is safe that's for sure. ParJar isn't meant to store your, I assume, &gt;10 bitcoins, it's just meant for small scale tipping and for easy transactions for rewards etc. 
I personally use it to reward a lot of community members for their help and support. Instead of asking "can you send me your bitcoin address" and taking a whole day to actually finally send it, I just send them a tip using ParJar. It's instant and feeless, I love it :) 
PS: Also this is Telegram we're talking about, governments freaking hate Telegram because they can't figure out who is using it. So unless you're sending your personal address, ID and mobile number, and bitcoin address no one is ever gonna find out who you are and what your bitcoin address is. ParJar tips are based on usernames, not public addresses. Only ParJar knows your address, but again it's stored on the offline database I mentioned earlier! 
Please I invite you to talk with the devs, users and community members! We love some good skepticism from your part, it only helps to improve ParJar

Here are screenshots of that sweet BTC tipping! 
If you want to see more screenshots of ParJar in action you can see it [here](

Binance isn't on a real blockchain either but it's the most used crypto exchange in the world ;)
@_date: 2018-10-20 11:13:58
What's so shady about an ERC20 and what does Parachute and PAR have to do with the fact you can now tip BTC on Telegram using ParJar bud :)
@_date: 2018-10-04 06:56:58
That's definitely a use case! You can also use it to send multiple transactions easily and quickly. I get rewarded, along with co admins, with ParJar because otherwise the one rewarding us has to fill out 12 addresses and send 12 different transactions, now it's easy and simple he just replies to one of our comments and tips us like you said :)

It's the app of 2gether.global, you can get a card there to spend crypto :)
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:06:01
Here's the sandwich for people that are interested along with the card I used to purchase it and the receipt: 
Not gonna buy it next time though, super expensive for just a sandwich.. misread the price tag
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:36:32
Thanks dude!
@_date: 2019-08-07 19:51:08
That's right ��
@_date: 2019-08-07 19:50:48
It was okay, better when I thought of the fact I freaking used BTC to get it which makes it awesome, however I would not recommend it simply because of the price lol
Looked more promising than what it tasted likes see my previous post haha
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:36:27
Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:40:31
Yeah it's a prepaid card so you can use it for any type of VISA payments  and it has SEPA / IBAN bank transfers to get your money out 
So yeah it supports fiat also definitely
@_date: 2019-08-07 19:11:01
What's that?
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:27:17
Zero they have some sort of agreement with Kraken who does the exchanging for them. 
You can if you prefer deposit your own Bitcoin in a wallet that 2gether interfaces and still pay with your card, however every transaction is gonna cost you blockchain fees.
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:36:06
Completely agree, I normally make my own sandwich and those can be called proper sandwiches haha
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:04:42
It's called 2gether, it's a European startup currently offering a card that you can use to spend crypto
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:02:25
No NFC pay yet.. it's definitely on the roadmap though along with Apple pay
@_date: 2019-08-07 20:33:30
I mean if there's a time to quote Lil Uzi, you found it dude. Not too sure about the getting money part, but I bet that sandwich is gonna be super expensive in hindsight haha

Colorado: 
@_date: 2018-11-07 15:37:06
I agree, that needs to change
@_date: 2018-11-07 22:07:42
America's never ever been nearly as socialist as many European countries are. Look at the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway; **very** socialistic in nature and **very** successful and happy countries. 
Socialism is based on trust and a greater good principle. Is that really so bad?
If you fail in a purely capitalistic system due to disease for example, you're really fucked. In a socialistic system, not so much you get helped to get back on your feet. 
Using Cuba and failed communist states as examples for why Socialism is bad is, is like using oligarchies (like Saudi Arabia) as examples for why Capitalism is bad. It doesn't make any sense using extremes as examples.
Both are equally good in their own respects, it's about finding a good and suitable balance

To get a whole town or country to use Bitcoin you need politicians nowadays pushing the legislation behind it.. 
Though Dash seems to be adopted by the Venezuelan population without any governmental backing so I may be wrong!
I'm french, don't got any (political) affiliation to these governors lol 
@_date: 2018-11-07 15:01:41


Good luck using bitcoin with anarchy, who's gonna be providing your internet access to use bitcoin then? That's the establishment I mean, the establishment is just how the world functions right now. 


I'm increasingly worried about that fact yes haha, I believe there'll be a critical point in the near future where people will get tired of all the politicians X banksters shit though, that change is slowly but surely happening with the new generation of politicians being elected 
@_date: 2018-11-07 14:39:11
Calm down buddy I'm not trying to deny what you say, just giving my opinion


Where do you live? 


Certainly agree that it doesn't need any legislation to be used. What I mean is, it needs legislation to be adopted on major scale. There's a certain establishment in the world nowadays and people (society) really do depend on that establishment to function and have guarantees (safety for example), otherwise there will be straight anarchy and Purge type of shit.
So in order to have major adoption, that establishment needs convincing, and more importantly guarantees (aka laws to not get that anarchy type of shit); that's where politicians, who represent the people, come into play to change the establishment using the power of legislation :)


Well I actually do care about the state of other countries and the way their heading, especially America. And I also care about Bitcoin so that's why I give a rather major fuck ��
@_date: 2018-11-07 15:19:15
I know what anarchy is. What you're telling me is a dream state I WISH the world could be in. Where people work and do what they like and everyone lives in peace. Anarchy the way you describe it is an utopia, it will never ever happen... 
The thing is, that will never happen. The current political systems are just reflections of human nature. We're a social species, always have been and we live in "packs" with "pack leaders". There will always be a central authority.
Anarchy will eventually result in new leaders, and guess what politics too eventually. The human race came from anarchy and flourished under democracies, tyrannies, dictatorships, aristocracies (partly enabled by survival of the fittest). Humans love order in any shape or form. It's just the way we are. 
The thing is, people like you  and me need to make the best of it. The social systems we're in are bigger than ourselves. You can represent the people of your country too if you wish to, or do nothing at all that's the beauty of it, it's a democracy ��

Project is very solid, large and experienced team (the ex JP-morgan executive is one of the founders and is a professor in economics at a university in Madrid), awesome and extensive whitepaper and technical papers, currently testing a working crypto debit card, with the platform and app release in Q4 this year. Shitcoin is a tad bit too low of a term for this one haha
@_date: 2018-07-19 21:32:29
You didn't do your homework man.
There's not even an ICO for that exact reason; to not let people get their hopes up and to not put unnecessary pressure to the team to improve token value. 2gether is focused on the long term, and wants to abide to every jurisdictions and regulations there are; another reason to not have an ICO ...
And to learn what?? 
@_date: 2018-07-30 17:10:36
It's the companies logo yes, but it's primarily bitcoin's logo 
@_date: 2018-07-22 07:07:29
Freaking great investment! Moving from bitcoin to solar; brilliant! Have you thought of having your rain water catcher and filter too? Love the fact that you got into solar, it kind of compensates the massive amount of energy that was needed to make your investment due to the power needed for mining!! Love it dude ��
@_date: 2018-07-30 08:22:21
Selling Dash cards using a Bitcoin logo *mmmm* - spotted in a store in Girona, Spain 
@_date: 2018-07-19 13:29:36
Great tool! Any place where you can submit a token you want followed? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 21:50:46
Aah okay didn't know I was talking to a bitcon elitist, my bad. 2gether runs on a hybrid of its own private chain and the ethereum blockchain. Thanks to the private chain, it's not too difficult of a task to switch to a better or more optimised blockchain, why not bitcoin in the future? 
Thanks for the good luck, and we'll see in the future who was right, the project might fail, but it isn't and will never be a scam. They got a VISA approved debit card, are registered and endorsed in and by Spain, and they got EU approval. 
Best of luck to you too bud, wish you good fortune :) 
Edit: spelling &amp; typos
@_date: 2018-07-30 13:37:07
Hmm I guess you're right, haven't checked it out when I saw it but I'm sure it's credits for an exchange of sorts. Still, it's weird they tell you on the card that you get 50€ worth of Dash and then proceed to place a big ass Bitcoin logo to attract attention 
@_date: 2018-07-19 21:00:31
Great vision, don't understand the hate in the comments. An ex-bank executive has a very positive vision about crypto and sees an actual use-case, and people throw shade. The crypto space has become so freaking pessimistic and toxic on Reddit man :(
