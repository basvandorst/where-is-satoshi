Cryptos are a new thing. there was so much shit that happens. Shit that happens with all new things. I think when they make a reset and start new some of that shit won't happened again. Thera are so much learnings. A reset isn't possible. So i think it will go down and up in close range maybe between 6 - 15 k. It takes a time to stabilizes and provide a heathy rise to new ATH.

Mhm maybe for a short time. At the moment i think its very hard to make a preview. The Market is very silent. 5-600 +- is possible. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 21:58:29
I think so. There will be more future then Past.

Wich Day ?
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:12:59
That same story we had yesterday..... 
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:15:19
For long term hold .....yes.... 
For short term deals.... look at the last days.... its ok, but would wait für 8300. But it can be ok.

Maybe the Big Players will ruin Bitcoin. I have the feeling that at the moment they can make what they want. They can push and pull the price. They can be the Bull and the Bear. They want their profit. And i think they don't want to have a lot of Millionär beside them. The idealist want to give Africa a currency for everybody..... But a rich Africa.... that not what the west states world want to.

Absolutly, i started with 1 BTC on my HODL List. Now im at 9 BTC &amp; withdraw a lot. Only HODLing is stupid... in my opinion the Lambos will come, but it will be a long time till then. And maybe when you play the daily game you will have more then only with waiting.

No Signals or creepy Graphs. i try to buy on a dip and sell early . My goal was to make 200€ a day. Sometimes its more sometime i have to hold it 2-4 days. Don't try to go to big goals. collect a lot small goals.

Every dip offers new chances. I think the best way is to work with two Pool, one for HODL, and one for daytrading. Now are Day Trading times. I think this up and down will  go on for a time.
