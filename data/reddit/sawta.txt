Well, it's great to know that not only was MtGox hacked but they also gave out basic login information about a user that's accusing them of possible wrong doing.


So essentially, guilty until proven innocent then?
I don't use MtGox personally, so the outcome doesn't really affect me either way but simply because they have cursorily evidence saying that things look "weird" isn't exactly the final nail in the coffin.  It seems to me that MtGox might have been baited into tipping their hand too soon, before all the facts were gathered.  If nothing else, I hope this is a learning experience for them.

Reminded me of Brazil's money problems mentioned recently on This American Life. [link](
I haven't read enough about BitCoin yet to really have a solid opinion on the matter, but from what I can tell it seems like all money basically has value because people think it has value.

I don't see this as a negative.  There's always room for improvement, so highlighting areas where Bitcoin is weak, and can be improved, I view as a good thing.  It shows that people care enough about it to show where it's lacking. It doesn't paint Bitcoin in the most positive light, but it's great that they're taking notice.
