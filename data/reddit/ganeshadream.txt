Agree. The problem is we're in a little bubble. A lot of us have been with bitcoins for years. We embrace it philosophically and ideologically. In the midst of this, it's grown enormously. But it's become a different "beast". It's now in the hands of people that only want to make more MONEY. And by this I mean "shitty" fiat money. There are few people buying bitcoins that want to "make" bitcoins. 
The essentially ideology has been lost. 
Which is telling. I'm sacred all people want is a pump and dump. They just want bitcoin to rise, so they can sell. A lot of the "old" bitcoiners are the most to blame. 
Everyone, sorry, most people just think in terms of the fiat it can generate. 
If that's you: fuck you.

Mygod, it’s horrific. This is most definitely NOT going to trigger the next bull run. 
Stand by my comment about click bait title.

Why is this post being downvoted?
You are not supposed to downvote something just because you don’t like it. This is a legitimate article expressing a particular point of view. You may not like it, but it might in fact be useful, if not informative about the way some people think about bitcoin. 
To be honest, downvoting this is almost proving Shiller’s point.
