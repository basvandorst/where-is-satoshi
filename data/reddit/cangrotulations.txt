A little of both. Mostly still in the rat race. Nice car is still only in my dreams yet...

Thanks, this 7-character design is actually called "Prestige", and goes for the top price on 
Most plates in Queensland are ugly as fuck with a maroon-on-white motif:

:P I also dreamt about it for ages, since at least a year ago, so I was pleasantly surprised it was still available.   I guess the price would have put a few people off, like it kept putting me off.

And apparently someone already did :)

There's a club?

On that day I'll know I've truly made it in this world...

It'll be a while before I can afford the merc, but yes I have the same thing in mind ;)

Yeah, from 
Apparently NSW and VIC still have a 6-char maximum though.

Each state could IF they allowed 7 characters. Each state has it's own rules about what characters / combos are available. The default in Qld is something like 123 ABC  (3 random numbers and 3 random letters).
So on that note, I would definitely expect someone to purchase the same combo in Sydney and Melbourne if the opportunity comes up.

Sure, but I haven't bought it yet.  Actually just search for Mercedes on Google images and take your pick :)  I decided not to put this plate on my current old car and will just wait til I get something nice. There's no rush; plates in Queensland are yours for life when you purchase a combo.

That's probably also why QLD has a rather healthy second-hand market for these things... eg. search for plates on  and you'll see what I mean.

It cost AUD 3295.00
