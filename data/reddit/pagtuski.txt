You must've clicked on the wrong guy, or otherwise you must be lying. I haven't posted anything verge related in a while.
@_date: 2019-07-19 12:03:25

"also you accept verge, gtfo"
yeah, a long time ago. idk where you found that at but the fact that you actually looked through my post history to find dirt or whatever says a lot about you lmao. BCH is a joke

Really hope it's not true, McAfee doesn't seem like a crazy guy... well, till he went to SA.. but still..
@_date: 2018-09-04 21:35:27
You must be trolling. Not only did you recommend they buy stocks rather than a real currency, but you contradicted yourself with bitcoin &amp; bitcoin cash with one not being a "store of value".

The guy was assuming that someone was called a liberal as an insult. Your typical liberal would be in favor of more gov't, and by even assuming that being called a "liberal" is an insult, you agree that in the context of what we're all here on this subreddit for, liberals are detrimental to Bitcoin. I don't know why you needed help figuring out the obvious.
@_date: 2018-08-31 17:13:15
Just curious, why?
@_date: 2018-08-31 00:43:44
Did he just assume your gender?
@_date: 2018-08-31 17:35:32
I don't agree with the guy but why are we reporting people and labelling them trolls based off of their name? We can check his history, y'know...
@_date: 2018-08-28 18:57:41
This is, in my opinion, beautiful.
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:54:32
You are looking at the non-political definition of liberal, not the people who would identify with or be considered being such. While it's true that conservatives are calling people liberals as an insult, I'm talking about the political definition of a liberal and not what you've been called by said conservative.
They, by nature, *want* more government.
This would mean that one that politically identifies as a liberal would want regulatory control over Bitcoin, therefore making them a threat to Bitcoin.
Other than that, I do not disagree with the dictionary definition of a liberal. Non-politically, you're one, I'm one, everyone here is essentially one. Fiat's owned by the governments, however we want to break free of their regulatory control over *our* money, so it's less likely that someone who uses bitcoin would identify as politically liberal even though we may have some here.
@_date: 2018-08-15 04:50:27
Hate to break it to you, but...
@_date: 2018-08-31 01:14:46
Doesn't matter what it means if the people that run by its name contradict its meaning.

@_date: 2018-08-31 17:15:04
more regulation will also kill everything that bitcoin stands for.
@_date: 2018-08-31 01:25:19
But isn't it true that liberals would, by nature, support a system that denigrates bitcoin?
At this point, to even consider calling someone who identifies as a liberal an insult is telling a whole lot.

*Two* murders? *Rape?* Where'd these accusations come from? Can I get some sources?

Easy, get an app where you can make a certain gesture to scan the BTC address QR &amp; pay the money.
Either way, not too much more complicated than the register.

..if you've got a problem with the rich then you might be a problem. Banksters, literally everyone understands. Government? Corporatist scumbags? Understood. But rich people? wtf the hate makes no sense unless you're a socialist.
Anyway, you're missing the point my friend. The masses, those sheeple, they will listen to these rich guys and big figureheads in the media. These are normal folk that don't really know about crypto the way we do, my guy. This is good for us because not only did another human being get into crypto, BUT he's likely inspired many other people to do the same.
Monkey see monkey do is a common phenomena in economics, especially in investing. Don't be narrowminded about this, think outside of the box. The rich and the banksters hate that, that's why they closed my account for buying Bitcoin (Bank of America, you bastards!).
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:26:55
That's more understandable.
It's just that the masses will follow the establishment sort of folk, not that I would ever really care about what someone from such a thing would care.
@_date: 2019-12-17 00:15:23
I'll have to disagree. You aren't immediately a bankster's puppet if you're rich. You must really dislike rich people, probably advocate for equal wealth distribution too.
@_date: 2019-12-14 21:28:18
I mean a rich guy with a lot of followers telling everyone that he bought bitcoin is a very strong signal that people should buy btc. Why should anyone care about "buying" yours?

take your funnies, calling crypto worthless is denying its potential.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:36:24
haha yeah these self-deprecating reddit memes sure are funny and cool and do make newcomers more comfortable with buying crypto haha yeah

Funny how the title literally says you can use bitcoin to pay for an uber, but you wouldn't expect having to do all this extra bullshit just to buy an Uber.

yes, that's if he realized *a gain*. he is literally using it as a currency its self and is not using fiat.

he does not need to pay tax.
@_date: 2019-05-05 01:30:15
It is simply my opinion. I never told others not to. You have to do what you have to do in order to make it in life. If trading bitcoin is your job and you want to do things that way, then do it, I highly encourage it! You take no risks other than the ones you choose the take and you're making yourself successful, don't listen to me.
I'd never tell someone to take a risk not paying the tax man. After all, they are the only ones that finally got Al Capone.

What? Attaining something with actual value to it and having some people discourage you from getting more? I'm sure *everyone* here can relate to that.

You're the "when moon" guy that has little to no interest in crypto outside of making money or hitting it rich. There is absolutely no reason that the government should tax me on a motherfucking currency they do not own. Crypto isn't stock or real estate, it's some goddamn data for fucks sake. Imagine if you were taxed on the amount of books you have, or every math problem you solved. That is insanity.
When I say that the government's stealing my money, I initially did not mean about all tax. I meant that they want money for us owning something they don't own nor control.
@_date: 2019-05-16 23:45:36
I mean yeah, it is a GREAT way to access the blockchain and I love the fact that blockstream even did this, but I think that once people get serious enough about crypto then they should start on this.
Internet just gives people more of a backbone until there's plenty satillites in orbit.
