First of all, CoinSimple and Mycelium Gear share the principle that your payment processor should not hold or touch your money. So, it's great to see multiple non-custodial payment processing options for merchants. Having launched CoinSimple a few months ago, we (selfishly) think that Mycelium validates our idea :-) But CoinSimple and Mycelium Gear differ in several aspects, some of which I will describe below:
*Disclaimer: My answer below is based after trying Mycelium Gear for 1 day but developing CoinSimple for quite some time, so it would be great to get some input from Mycelium too.*
**CoinSimple supports 5 more types of wallets** compared to what Mycelium Gear supports now. For CoinSimple, a wallet can be
1. a BIP32 wallet (currently Electrum 2.0, Trezor)
2. a multisig BIP32 wallet (currently Electrum 2.0)
3. a deterministic (but not HD) wallet (currently Armory or Electrum 1.9.8)
4. a non-deterministic wallet (any bitcoin address) including those of any exchange
5. a bitcoin exchange through its API (currently MeXBT)
6. a bitcoin payment processor (currently BitPay, Coinbase, GoCoin)
**I will mention a few features that CoinSimple offers in addition to the great offering of Mycelium Gear**. CoinSimple allows merchants to
1. create invoices on the web and send them via email.
2. choose the wallet they want to use on an invoice-basis. For example, Trezor for one invoice, and Electrum 2.0 for another.
3. choose the price source they want to an invoice-basis. For example, Bitcoin Average for one invoice and Bitstamp for another.
4. choose one of 193 national currencies to price their invoices
5. create recurring invoices that are sent via email through CoinSimple
6. create payment links that can be included in emails, social media, instant messages
7. receive email notifications when their customer paid
8. through the Android app (currently in beta, to be released on May 12), it allows merchants to have untrusted employees generate invoices on their behalf
9. integrates with WooCommerce and Wordpress eCommerce
10. have analytics data about their products and customers
11. through integration with Shapeshift, accept any cryptocurrency but receive bitcoin (currently in beta, to be released on May 12)
12. convert to fiat currency through integrations with BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin
I hope I answered your question, and I will make sure I have a detailed writeup about the differences soon. I will keep updating this thread as we add more features.

Nikos, here, Founder and CEO of CoinSimple.
We are looking into price stability options right now.
It's currently very easy to integrate with CoinSimple any service that associates a bitcoin address with a national currency or asset. For instance, you can add your BitReserve.org bitcoin address associated with your USD BitReserve "card" into CoinSimple now and immediately convert bitcoins to BitReserve dollars.
What we need to do is to make it a bit more obvious on the site and we are working on that.

Nikos Bentenitis here, Founder and CEO of CoinSimple. CoinSimple has been my project and "my baby" since 2014.
To address some of the points that you made: 
CoinSimple will continue working for as long as it is useful to people. In terms of development, we do maintain the code but we are very frugal in terms of adding new features.
Finally, CoinSimple has been growing organically without any marketing. For that reason, our social media presence has been lacking.
