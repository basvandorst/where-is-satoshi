Gate.io - easy and nice to use with a lot of pairs.
For fiat, I use coinbase Pro.

There's no way the US fed would allow them to do that as it would more easily allow people to launder money. The same reason why bullion by post will not allow people to buy gold directly with bitcoin without KYC.

I would:
-buy a ledger nano S
-set up bitcoin wallet on there
-keep the recovery sheet safe, in multiple locations.
-bookmark the public address, save it to emails and test it out by sending small amounts of BTC
-log in to ledger and move the BTC (test to see all goes well)
Now onto selling:
-Advertise your house online and advertise its for BTC exclusively
-maybe the reporter can help you by printing an article about it.
-if/when someone is interested VVVVVVVVV
-seek advice from a property lawyer and draw up a contract which both you and they sign
-once you've both signed the doc, detailing they will send i. E. 45 BTC to your BTC address, the property will be then sold to them
In london it happens quite regularly. International buyers buy expensive houses and they use BTC often (saw it in a documentary, it could be BS)
Good luck

You're a mong if you think that. There are many legitamite sources you can use to buy bitcoin. Furthermore, the fact you claim you're not a criminal is only based off the the current infrastructure. If the elite decided for whatever reason your current behaviour, or your opinions, are antisocial, you could very well end up with "low social credit" and be denied access to the "free world".

She has invested in the company coinbase, along with many other companies, not necessarily crypto. Its not like she is going to start Shilling bitcoin 24/7 on instagram.

Ive been out of the bitcoin game for time, I remember it being good last year. The address ending in BSyT is the correct address I sent it to, looks like I will have to wait.

Thats right, I dont know where the 1.52 came from but I sent 0.073. It was from an exchange so it could just be the way they send transactions.

Only invest what you cannot lose. No wait:
Only invest what you cannot afford to lose,
Only trade what you cant lose.
