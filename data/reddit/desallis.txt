The Blockfolio app lets you input your holdings and the buy in price and shows you how far up (or down) on your holdings value you are, which it sounds like the feature you are after.

Absolutely, the objective is to buy more Bitcoin at a low price and hold which is what I have been doing, although I have a feeling based on the historical market swings we haven't reached that lowest price as yet. A sharp peak in a small space of time will most likely result in another equal drop and time to buy buy more Bitcoins.

I think anyone with even basic hardware can mine, but if its actually practical and profitable is something else entirely.
A laptop with a 970m could possibly mine .50 cents a day or so in bitcoin using NiceHash (*varies depending on market rates). The problem is the thermal properties of laptops, they don't manage heat well due to the size and the electricity cost if you are looking for profitability.
Even for a modest investment you could put together a 4 to 6 GPU mining rig and get $5 - 10 USD a day*.
Again its not going to be instant riches its a long term trickle if you are looking to build your holdings.
Nice hash is a good platform if you have limited hardware, because otherwise trying to mine bitcoin (impractical) or some of the other cryptos solo, you wont get much return out of the stress on your hardware which you are slowly cooking.
You can get an idea of the profitability here.
But really I wouldn't recommend a laptop to mine on.

Looking at the market trends the dip took a day the upswing took 2 hours, I agree this is the eye of the storm, this isn't over by a long shot. 
This rapid upswing is fueled by people buying up coins others are panic dumping, remember as it goes up, some of those buyers are also going to start panic dumping again once they hit a point where they think they can cash out.
Anyone patting themselves on the back or breathing a sigh of relief that its going back up is basically that girl in the boat at the end of Friday The 13th thinking its all over before Jason jumps out of the lake.
I bought a nice chunk at 3200 so I'm not FOMOing out but I have limit orders down to 2600 too, and they are staying that way for at least the next week.

That is the smart way to do it, buy in set amounts over time for better average losses/gains rather than the "all in" gambler mentality as soon as there's a drop. 
I just think people celebrating the climb already might be a little premature.
This sums it up what I suspect might happen
