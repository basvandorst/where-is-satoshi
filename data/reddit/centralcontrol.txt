That is because... oh... it was actually somewhat functioning as an exchange then. * This was actually the precursor to its demise.  "if i knew then what i know now" to quote an old phrase, it was a very similar reason to why the price was so high to begin with.

in the US anyway, AML laws have been in place for a long time.  most of our banks file thousands of SARs a day.  if a customer is being remotely suspicious, they must be reported.  its really silly actually, but true. 
this is not about exchanging coins.  its about exchanging coins _with knowledge_ that they were being laundered.  huge distinction.

Not a shareholder.  Most of the major corporations pay dividends to its shareholders.  For most national banks, this is less than $.30 per share and out of reach of most minimum wage workers.  They have to be satisfied with their little 1-3% savings returns.
If you are referring savings interest, CDs or other forms of savings, the banks make much more then the tiny amounts they give back to their customers.

That is how its supposed to work.  However, you are forgetting that the Federal Reserve needs to make money as well.  Consumer loans are generally loans on top of loans on top of loans.
I can't remember the last time I have been able to get a "pure" cash loan from a bank that doesn't involve a mortgage or a credit card.  Mortgages are a paltry fixed rate now, so they can't really make money off of those.  Credit cards on the other hand... 
The last time I did get a cash loan, it was from a credit union about 10 years ago.  When I asked for one about 5 years ago, I basically got laughed out of the bank regardless of my decent credit status.

So if they lose all their money on shit investments, what happens next?  they get taken over, liquidated and/or re-sold by the FDIC...  have you even seen the list of banks that were declared insolvent by the FDIC since 2000?  how many of those banks had executives walk away without a scratch for their poor decisions?  plenty.
plenty of banks lean on the FDIC.  its why a majority of them pay the premiums on the depositors money... that is kind of the point of insurance.  
if you had a car, you have to get insurance (by law) so you have something to "lean" on if you get in an accident.  you are immediately taking a chance that you might get in an accident the second you turn that key.  does that stop you from driving?  nope.  banks like BofA don't need FDIC insurance because, well, their assets trump their deposit base.  
its not like they are gambling the insurance money directly, but they kinda do as they only hold fractional reserves.  they are basically spending money they don't have.
is that clearer to you now?

Oh yes... I completely know the banks here are broken.  When new local banks are established and get a decent customer base, they are promptly bought out and squeezed dry out by the major banks.
Disclaimer:  I have been involved with the financial services industry for about 10 years and have seen more criminal behavior internal to those organizations then they claim is happening from outside sources.  Granted, a ton of this is getting flushed out by the massive regulation that is going on, but its like whack-a-mole on a grand scale.
@_date: 2014-03-03 05:34:41
Honestly, interest rate returns from banks are shit.  They can take that .5% i get on my savings account and shove it.
They already charge high fees, and more fees on top of those.  I had a checking account SNAFU recently, and they literally charged me a fee for a fee.
There is no reason for them to back their own loans if they are still getting dirt-cheap loans from the Fed.  Sure, the massive cash reserves help, but in the event of a run, all they have to do is close their doors and go crying to the government.
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:41:32
I had to think about this a second, but you are very much correct.  There should be no problem to have all customer funds removed from an exchange on a whim.  Well, at least until the business flops from lack of income and no way to pay rent or other operational costs.
If I understand you correctly, you are saying that the only money that should be handled as profits, are the actual profits they are making from fees, etc...
Such a novel concept.  I wish our banks would learn this and not have to lean on the FDIC for deposit insurance.

you are right.  the market is the market.  however, if it is not functioning as an exchange, there is no reason for it to still be listed.  i would not say its dragging down the market, as most of the traders i know have already hit the "ignore button" on its values.  on the flip side of that, it is providing misinformation to people who don't care or want to know the drama of the community.

Very much so.  I have nearly all the AML procedures memorized.  If you even so much as suspect a transaction is dirty, you have to report it or be held liable.  
"Faiella eventually ended the partnership with Shrem. By 2013, he was exchanging more than $20,000 a week for Silk Road clients."

I counter your bullets:
1.  How long do funerals take over there?   Even with planning, the whole process can't take more than 10 days.   If you are on here to convince Reddit of your honesty, you might want to post some pics of a body or something.  Morbid, but true.
2.  Not usually.  Police usually like to have a person in custody prior to resolution.  It varies from country to country, but that is usually the case.  We have this thing in the US we like to call a "flight risk".  You have already flown, so your actions are not supporting your case, whatsoever.
3.  Concerning?  Quit being a baby, and resolve your loose ends.  Fraud or not, this would be my personal priority  to get this shit resolved if it were my name on the line.  If the charges are truly false, I would be pissed-off and literally banging on their front door until they sorted this shit out and cleared my name.
(4.) "Coins on MtGox" is not a very provable argument.  The conspiracy that you and "bitcoin" are being setup, is kinda silly too.

i digress.  "learning" is nullified and irrelevant to my top statement.
my underlying and corrected point is that, while the money can be good, *edit: _risky investments_ should not be a direct function of a bank.  IMHO, more, smaller banks could better serve the public (with exceptions of perks like nation-wide ATMs and such..) by providing additional stability to our economy.  by no means would they be the cash-cows that they are today and would require a massive shift in the way we conduct business.  My option on this remains, and will always be a pipe-dream.

being honest for one second, with no warning attached, coins are basically produced out of thin-air as well.
what is the difference, you may ask?  coins are produced at a decreasing rate over time roughly based on demand (mining). 
its probably better to say: "stay away from worthless paper produced out of thin air when its needed to falsely increase/decrease inflation or pay debt."

unrelated to most of your post, i have to say having worked in the financial industry for quite a while, i can say that most of the executives are idiots.  they brought the regulation on to themselves by peddling mass quantities of shit funds in 2008 and allowing fraud to run rampant.
but &lt;sigh&gt;, you are right.  7 billion in BTC is pennies to them in the long run.  they can fix this problem.  the days of putting executives and other Sr. leadership on pedestals for worship by their minions is over, and they should realize that.  realizing that their people can probably fix most of this if they weren't bound by the aforementioned idiocy of having to produce .ppt presentations of completely fucked up metrics 24/7.
what does this rant have to do with anything?  its complete lack of communication and understanding of the needs of the masses.  they create product.  public is force-fed the new product.  they have been playing this game for so long, they are completely fucking blind to the fact that a new trend is forming outside of their control.  just like every-fucking-thing else they do: its completely knee-jerk.  they are canceling accounts due to "regulation" issues, which is complete and utter bullshit.  there _is no regulation_ on bitcoin.
sorry... i have a few years of pent-up issues that i still need to resolve, i think.  (rant not directed at you OP, you were quite clear on your post)


just lawled all over myself after reading this, then reading my post again. XD
Edit2:  For the downvoters out there, go sit through a few executive presentations where all they do is stroke their own ego's prior to their meetings to cut those 20,000 jobs.
when i hear these reports about them bashing BTC, all i can think about is how most of them already own patents on their own proprietary coins.  of course they are going to claim "regulators" made them do it because that is how the culture works in these banks.  always divert attention to something that seems like a logical scape-goat. (it used to be "oh, we have to do this because our shareholders want X..." and all that bull.  now its the governments fault, of course. )

@_date: 2014-02-23 02:16:54
i wouldn't say its a conspiracy... that is way to strong of a term.
lack of understanding?  yes.  correct analysis?  yup. (our markets are volatile right now, there is no denying that.)  correct foresight?  abso-fucking-loutely not.
unless they put their day traders to work on this stuff (which they can't because the markets don't close) and they have inside info on the markets (which they can't really get because there is nobody to bribe) they are not going to look twice at this stuff.
there is no way to control this stuff in their favor without doing raw buying and selling.  no shorting (kind of), no major hedge funds, or ways to make hyper-complex contracts that they can bundle and sell off to third-world countries.
the volatility is real and raw.  there is no way to close down a specific market if it starts to crash because of a high-speed trading error.  we are supporting this, pure and simple.  it ain't going to look as nice as what we see on the stock markets.  MTGox dies?  We find ways to trade.  Crypsty starts doing development on production systems again?  We move.  Fees?  Distributed and mostly fair.

i beg to differ.  many companies have stopped issuing hard payroll checks in favor of reusable debit-like cards.  [these have fees like any other card](
if you need to avoid the fees, you have to have a direct deposit, which forces us to have a checking or savings account somewhere.
if you want money for a job that pays more than $9/hr taxed, you are forced to use the banks. otherwise, you basically can't get a job because no company is going to pay you in that cash stuff anymore.

OK.  This is going to sound REALLY cliché...
I love trading, but if you trade, "Buy low, sell high."  IMHO, there is not really a good write-up on the subject and you really have to learn by experience.
If your newfound wealth allows, start small with around 5-10BTC in an active altcoin market.  DO NOT INVEST MORE THAN YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE.
Learn how the trading tables react to your buys and sells.  Its generally different for each market.  
Absolutely do not buy into the pump-and-dump schemes that are out there.  Play into them, but do not expect much until you understand how they work.
A profit is a profit is a profit. Take them any time you can.  Track all of your trades and if you ever feel like you are starting to really gamble, back off and sleep for a few days.

The people at the very, very bottom own most of the debt.  /s

You just totally soothed my soul.
Out of respect for others, I would kindly suggest that you review all market orders and issue refunds if and where appropriate.  I am not going to argue that subject, as its only a suggestion.
Edit:  Yes.  Totally confirmed.  PROD tomorrow, please!

To be very direct, your explanation does not compute for very simple reasons:
1.  There are two variables in LIMIT:  BTC and USD
2.  There are two conditions in LIMIT: Buy and Sell
3.  There are three options in LIMIT: Good, Immediate or Fill-Kill
Each option of the above dictates very simple maths and very basic coding.  Even easier: Its a hierarchical decision path on the client side.   Please refer to my last paragraph about how I believe that with the combined intelligence of your staff, it is impossible to believe that this was not a willful decision.
This is the absolute core of client-side math.  &gt;:
Edit:  Really?  You guys had a meeting to decide that "Oh, lets not include this one line of code, because while we could do it, we really don't think people have used other exchanges before?"  I seriously doubt that.
Edit 2:  It is a built-in feature to click on the table price and have it show up as the price that you want to buy/sell for OR I can type in a price?   I am actually getting mad now.  Wow.  This was completely intentional... I was completely objective until you chimed in.

F'ing bullets:
1. Click the price on the table, or type in the price.
2. Click USD.  (It is already built to be clicked, as your CSS dimms it and it is an alternating field between MARKET-LIMIT)
3. You get the total 'amount' price in BTC, pre-calculated.
You are telling me that you only return, via your API, the low-precision estimate of a MARKET?  That is absolutely useful, of course!  However, class control-input, and product.quote_precision are already there so I am still not getting the full picture here.
Edit:  Again, this comes back to simplicity:  I want to buy or sell.  I have two options:  BTC or USD.  I almost think that you guys do this for ETH, but I am too lazy to dig more into your code...

While I understand your point, there are many people who cannot do that type of API integration.  Just because someone uses BTC and understands how to trade, doesn't mean they should know how to code.  I do talks on API integrations across multiple platforms and understand the subject quite well.  (That doesn't mean that I am an "uber-hacker" or anything, but does mean I understand the details.)
Simply put, it is not the intent of this thread to go any deeper than what is on the surface of the application.  In this case, I pay for a service through various fees and being nickle-and-dimed on something I perceive as having malicious intent is simply not acceptable.  This extends past my own needs, I believe.  I will gladly pay (usually way too much) for a service that is willing to collect those fees fairly.
You are also forgetting that I cannot live by my PC (as much as I would like, anyway.).  The mobile version carries the same restrictions, and if you have ever had to trade on your phone, you may feel my pain.
Edit: I am currently playing against the run-up on BTCC right now, and it is not a matter of super-speed.  It's a one-click difference that seriously shits on my parade when doing basic trading.
Edit 2:  Just used a MARKET order and it was the best money I have spent all day.  I am not opposed to fees, I am opposed to abuse, just to make my point.

quarters bro... quarterings.
@_date: 2016-07-14 04:55:44
SO trivial.  I am still not convinced it's not a scam to extract MARKET fees.

Don't feed the trolls.  :)
BTC moves up, BTC moves down.  The next $30 move that idiot  be like "LOOK DUDEE, I TOL UUUUUUU&gt; LULZ FART"
I actually disagree with you though.  He should mortgage his house, his mom and sell his soul to the local shark to lose on BTC.  More liquidity for us.
Edit:  Hell, I have lost thousands doing ignorent trades when I first got started.  Licked my wounds and moved on, and moved far away from FUD to try and make a coin move a penny.  :P
