Or 7. Satoshi created btc knew it would Change the world and he he would be pursued by gov and individual so he froze himself and will wake up in 25 years the richest person in the world.

The thought I have is the man/company/group that created this has taken into account the risks. You can see this in the lack of problems they/he has encountered over the last 4-5 years.

The same "analysis" central banks promote? Id rather have my analysis not contain the variables of debt and interest rates. 
  
But to each his own I guess.
@_date: 2014-09-09 20:40:11
Yes my mistake, guess I wasn't sober.
@_date: 2014-11-27 22:21:42
+1000 thanks for the link.
@_date: 2014-09-09 06:25:26
Yeah 1.5btc x .00000001 = number of counter hackers that sent btc.... If you think any counter hacker threw in more then  1-100 Satoshi you are smoking what I've been looking for.

One of thoes is mine! Cheers! By the way the only reason I saw your site was because of bitcoin, and will not be the last time. :)

Idk if it's the acid or this comment made my internet life complete.

Step one: become a multi billion dollar corporation
Step two: profit
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:45:03
I think it would work well with a total population of 1billion on earth. This 7billion bullshit just crowds the roads. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 03:40:05
Congrats! Keep up the sales!
@_date: 2014-03-30 02:35:20
Because we give it value. Why does USD have value? It's not backed by gold(or anything) and there is more debt than could ever be printed.

Wow I can't imagine a world where people use assets to purchase goods rather than receiving goods with an IOU. 
 
But no your right, let me throw my hat in the microwave real quick.

Solve bitcoin volatility by giving it to wall street banks.... good one.
@_date: 2014-08-13 20:11:45
Hot damn, I might have a twin here.

They cannot be this ignorant, they will try to keep control as long as they can manipulate simple minds to fund their profits. 
We need to educate others as well as expose them to bitcoin.

Hard for many to comprehend SR has better PR than gox or many other corporations. 
I find that hilarious.

I keep checking back here every hour looking for updates, then realizing it's 2:30 am and you are probably not talking with the teacher at this hour..
@_date: 2014-11-28 21:35:54
I do not think so, look at venmo (I don't use it but some of my friends do) alot of transactions are to friends with sugjestive memo's and "funny" uses of money. They obviously don't give a fuck what the purpose of a transaction is used for.
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:07:46
But actually?

The internet of money volume two is even better than the first, be sure to check it out.

Look for OTC liquidity providers if it’s a large enough amount you don’t trust normal exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 21:26:34
I feel the exact same way! I'm only in college and in a few weeks I have found bitcoin to be what I spend almost all of my free time on. 
Best damn drug I've ever done.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:39:57
Doing the same.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:52:59
Always a step ahead &gt;.&lt; That is awesome though, I'm glad to see that some company's can still profit. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:24:41
Right on.. Right on.
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:03:54
Except Obama made water boarding (a rumor) illegal for government use. Bush had no problem looking the other way in times of war, but then again the US doesn't even trust their own black devil. 
Correct me if I'm wrong.   
@_date: 2013-12-23 06:26:51
Yeah fuck them for giving people the opportunity to try substances that have been used by millions of people and recently illegal in the last half century. 
Freedom isn't free, weather you engage in these activities or not I fully support the idea that anybody can make a decision that affects themselves by themselves. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:32:43
Oh no they blocked me from a website,
*setup proxy server
*setup VPN  
Oh there it is working fine now. 
Fuck you too RIAA.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:41:51
Let it drop, Lower it drops the more I can put in when it comes back in a few weeks.

It would just be water cooled on a large scale? With any region having sufficiently cold enough water.
