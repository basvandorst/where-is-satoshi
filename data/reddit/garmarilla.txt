Lol except for ethereums/ethereum foundations dark little secret of centralized control over the code as they have proved over the DAO fiasco. 
Don’t get me wrong I’m holding eth short term but I have my doubts long term.

Implying that btc is aol is assuming that’s it’s a static monolith and that the code has not changed since its release. This is totally not true and shows a lack of knowledge about the coin.

With a fixed supply and PoW miner rejecting transactions with coins that dont Belong to you, how would bitcoin go into fractional reserve banking?
You can’t say, hey I just got 10 bitcoins and I’ll lend you 90% of my bitcoin without transferring 9 of your bitcoins to the other person. 
If you do You no longer have 10 bitcoins, you have 1 bitcoin.

I agree with what you have said above but it’s important not to mix criticism of crypto and the traditional stock market to excuse one with the other. 
We must look at both objectively. In this case we were discussing the stock markets growth behaviour and future potential. 
My point being that just because the stock market has existed and thrived through the industrial revolution and North America’s rise because of the devastation caused in Europe during WW2 does not mean it can continue this pattern of perpetual and exponential growth. 
Warning signs being that central banks are now stepping in to save this system by propping up stock markets with money they created and lowering interest rates to almost 0. 
These are really the only 2 tricks they have to play with. 
My understanding is that central banks having to prop up stock markets is a very new development. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:35:52
Why all the fud?
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:23:50
Compound interest is magical. My long term concern here is that it’s based on a model of perpetual growth on a planet with finite resources. 
How far we are from the cliff is anybody’s guess. 
Edit: perpetual AND exponential growth. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:20:11
I have to strongly disagree with that. Bitcoin was extremely innovative as a form of peer to peer cross border trustless payment system. Before bitcoin there was no way to send money to anyone, securely and within 10 minutes, anywhere in the world.  Wire transfers just don’t cut it. Credit cards don’t service every one. Oh yeah on of course with out having to go through a third party. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:59:08
Not disputing that compound interest is an amazing invention to use for wealth growth. However, on a timescale representing our civilization, 200 years is not a very long time. 
Also there are concerning factor like stock markets now being propped up by central banks such as in Japan where the Japanese central bank is purchasing 75%- 80% of ETFs with.... you know... money that they create. 
Also similar things are happening in Switzerland as well as Bank of America.

I am factoring that in. This planet cannot support an exponential population growth. 
Last time I researched this we were on track to top out around 11 billion people.

It’s private not anonymous

Can you give a link to this miner? The one I was looking was 3x the hashrate of an s9 but also consumed almost 3x more power. So just a bit better in efficiency. ~10%
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:35:18
Number of bitcoin transactions has nothing to do with the energy use of the bitcoin network. 
Network hashrate is directly related to energy  use. 
You can have 2 miners for bitcoin to work. 
The difficulty would just be extremely low to maintain 10 minutes blocks.
