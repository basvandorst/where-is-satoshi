I saw that thread 5 hours ago and told to myself: it must be a joke. it MUST be a joke. But I cant stop thinking about it... I was curious and finally clicked on that damn link ... :(
Please mods, remove that post immediately. How can we take down that link ? 
And how can that kind of video stay that long without nobody trying to remove it ?! This is fucking disgusting and sad and what makes me more sad is that nobody really cares because its fucking Internet and that calaber24p is just a pseudo :( Welcome to a fucking black mirror episod... :(

I work for a security company and I agree. It looks like you were on a phishing site. So you entered your credentials first and then, the fake site asked you for your 2FA codes. You submitted it several times, and the hacker can automatically login on the real website and even used it one of these codes to withdraw your Bitcoin...
It happens all the time with banking website and 2FA cant do anything about that. It can be a phising website. It can even be the real one but a malware inside your browser acts as a proxy for accessing the website, so they can intercept your credentials in real time. Finally, a malware can tamper the website so they prompt you anything they want, for exemple a pop up Windows asking you your 2FA... so they can use it to do transactions instead of you.
You should check your history, check your DNS settings, check finally if you dont have any trojan installed on your computer.
