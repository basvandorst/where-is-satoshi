Put $25,000 on a hard wallet but, be so cheap and impatient you buy a shitty wallet from a sketchy ass seller on Ebay.

If you invested in cryptos and made money, you didn’t come into anything though. You invested intelligently and made a return. This is no different than buying an investment property and selling it for twice the amount five years later or buying a bunch of stocks after the Recession and making a lot of money once the market rebounded. Same thing. If people demanded you to share your earnings after that, then you need to find new people to hang with.

You pretty much always have to go against the tide to win. Average people are poor. So if you’re doing what everyone else is doing......good luck. Technically everyone that’s buying cryptos now is going against the tide because the average person has no clue what it is or doesn’t trust it.

BA in Econ. I saw the value in Cryptos/Blockchain immediately. I wish I read about them in 2011 though.

Doubt it. I’d bet more Silicon Valley/Seattle types invested in cryptos before Wall Street did.

Congrats man! Enjoy it.

For the love of god, if you do invest, get a hard wallet. Trezor preferably.

I just spent Thanksgiving weekend with 30 family members who had no clue what I was talking about. And that’s Bitcoin. We’re not even talking about IOTA, Ethereum, Monero and NEO. A few of my friends know about Bitcoin but 99% of them think it’s a scam and haven’t invested yet despite me pleading with them to do so. It’s not as popular as you think.

I never heard of Bitcoin until May of last year and I promptly invested. 
Which is weird because I watched Silicon Valley religiously and back in Season 1, they made several references to cryptos and I never caught it. I immediately saw its value when I did. I just didn't have my ear to the ground early enough.

Who would put their fucking kid on that thing,

Same thing. Told my friend last week at $5,700. Called it a scam. When it's $20,000, I wonder if he'll admit to being wrong.

I tried to explain the utility of cryptos to my best friend last night and I got similar answers. This is a guy that always talked about he would've done this and this if he was old enough to participate in the 90s Internet era. That's Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies right now. All I got were excuses of it being a fraud/scam/unstable/not tied to anything/no value, etc. Same kid plopped down $1,000 bucks for an iphone. The way I see it is...if cryptos blow up, I'm out a few thousand bucks. I'm young. I'll get the fuck over it. But if they explode in a good way, then I'll probably be pissed I didn't put more in.
