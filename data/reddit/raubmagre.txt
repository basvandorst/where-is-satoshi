The issue is federal regulation vs voluntary regulation. Any libertarian/anarchist worth his salt would recognize that in the absence of federal regulators, private regulators would arise because big dogs in the industry want to increase barriers to entry for little guys to help them maintain a competitive edge. 
So, back to baby formula: nestle and whoever else make it aren't going to put cyanide in it, they're going to get some stamp of approval that helps them sell product, and it will be a symbiotic relationship between voluntary regulatory body, consumer, and firm.
The USDA is largely responsible for the growth in diabetes and metabolic syndrome in the US over the past 50 years. It's not like the regulatory bodies we already have are doing a bang-up job.

All currencies are backed by trust. "Backed" doesn't mean anything if you don't trust the institution backing it. So bitcoin being "backed" has everything to do with us trusting in the proof-of-work method of mining and all of that, and part of that is its scarcity. So "scarcity backed" isn't wrong.

I'm so annoyed by this piece. Like, so much misinformation and misplaced skepticism. There are tons of people (all over this subreddit) who are heavily vested in BTC becoming a viable currency, even if only for very large purchases. It's too valuable at the moment, but that value comes from its massive rise. Once that rise slows down and its value stabilizes, people will have no problem paying 3000 Satoshi for a coffee or something like that, whatever the stable value ends up being.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:39:31
Sure I did. I just disagree with your implications. What people do with their money is their business, no matter how much you think people "should" know about it. I'd rather crypto be "unregulated" than let the government get its sticky fingers all up in there. They're dramatically less transparent. And, it's a public ledger. The information is there.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:06:52
Disagree. I have debt and buy crypto. I don’t buy much, and I pay my debts each paycheck, but financially, crypto and other investments have a much higher potential return. My student loan debt isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so might as well take a small gamble and see if I can leverage that gamble into a much shorter debt timeline.

Is there a share price for... Basecamp? Nope, privately owned. If it's privately owned, who owns the shares? The owner(s) (if there are co-founders); if the shares are not for sale, there is no share price. 
This is very simple.

If I start a company and grow it without investment (totally possible), there are no shares. If I start raub magre inc and grow it to a point where I have a few developers and we have enough income that I don't need investment, there are no shares. I don't know if Samourai has shares or not. But the point stands: you can start a fucking company and not have shares. Then the owners get to keep all the profit and they don't have to pay a lick of attention to anything you say. Thank goodness.

You might want to work on how you write sentences. Here's a definition:
denoting or relating to products, services, or interests that appeal to a small, specialized section of the population
'iphone' is synonymous with 'smartphone'. You know what's not? Nexus, LG, whoever else. Is BMW niche? Is Audi niche? BMW has 2% of the market in the US, but it's hardly a niche product; ownership and appeal are different things. It's hard to be niche if you're aspirational. You can walk into a mall in any major city and find an Apple store. Apple was niche in 2000. Now it's among the most valuable companies in the world. Can't be niche if you're king of the fucking mountain.

My opposition to communism comes in many forms, but the primary one is its removal of private property. I can argue all day about how a company should be run, but communism seeks to rid the idea of private property. There's no way that works in business.

Ah yes, because the authoritarian regime currently running in Russia is so great, and the US helped topple the USSR; it's a nuanced situation, because the Russians went from one shitty situation to another.
How did a list of worker co-ops disprove anything? I never said democracy in the workplace can't exist, I just don't think it's an optimal way to run a business. Or at least democracy in the sense of a co-op. Furthermore, ownership doesn't have to equal leadership. I'm a big fan of dramatically increasing worker autonomy from the top all the way down to the lowest paid worker.
Seriously, read about Semler, you'll like him and what you read. It describes lots of what you'd want in a workplace, but doesn't do it from a necessarily political angle. It's a way of looking at how to run a company that massively challenges common structures. But it exists within the market, and happened voluntarily. So long as things happen voluntarily, my opinion doesn't matter, because that's the primary goal.

I accepted that I lost money the moment I invested. That was always a possibility. Unlike a stock, though, I actually own some BTC now. With stock, all I can do is sell it or hold on to it or buy more if. BTC is an actual thing I can use. Yes, its value is lower, but it's still a currency.

Bitcoin, in that sense, does have intrinsic value. There was a good post about it on here, I'm not sure if I can track it down. All moneys have intrinsic value, like gold, and definitely including bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't actually a money *yet*, because it's not a unit of measure like the USD, nor is it at the transactional level yet. But it is becoming a store of value. Beyond that, its real intrinsic value comes from two-way decentralized transactions that require proof of work. That's why Bitcoin is a fascinating technology. It's on its way to becoming a viable currency, but the reason people mined it in the first place wasn't speculation, it was because it could be useful for these kinds of transactions.

Caution is indeed warranted, but crypocurrencies aren't stocks. Nick Szabo often refers to currency as "the bubble that never pops". Of course individual currencies pop, but currency itself does not. Bitcoin may not be the lasting crypto from this time, but crypto is here to stay.

It doesn't have to be 100% bitcoin. Monero or Litecoin or other currencies will exist in the market. It seems entirely unrealistic to me to have one dominant cryptocurrency and a bunch of shitty ones that rise and fall. That is somewhat the case early on, with Bitcoin surviving and thriving best, but that will not always be the case. Eventually something like Litecoin will be worth $10,000 a coin, and Bitcoin will be worth many times that, and we'll all benefit from it.

Democracy in the workplace as well as a democratically elected communist state? 
It's clear you don't have a good understanding of how businesses are formed, maintained, and run in a way that keeps them successful. I'm sure that if we are ever freed from our corporatist nightmare, you'll have firms where everyone has a say and it's a democracy of sorts. Some will succeed, sure, but it's not a good way to run business. Democracy in general reduces autonomy and self-determination.
A good business provides workers with a competitive salary/benefits, purpose, and autonomy. It enables workers to do what they feel is most important, and does not riddle them with busywork and micromanagement. Read about Ricardo Semler and how he changed things in Brazil. It's not communism, its markets, and the freedom to act as you see fit. Trying to squeeze everything into one system, especially one as flawed as communism, will not work. People don't like communism, and that's more than just business owners.

So, people should embrace a lack of freedom if it fits someone's idea of what progress is?
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:26:09
Oh shit, you actually wrote something substantive instead of whining!
So, a poor person cannot invest, let's say. They're making just enough to survive. Their $20,000 annual salary is $20,000 the next year and $20,000 the year after that. Each year, they're knocked down by inflation.
Yes, a person making $200,000 a year is paying a larger 'inflation tax'. That was never in dispute, because obviously someone with more money is going to pay a higher tax assuming the tax is applied equally against every dollar in question.
But the tax is not applied equally.
A wealthy person is not likely to need a student loan. Education is cheaper when you're not paying interest on borrowed money.
A wealthy person is not likely to be without health insurance, and they probably have good health insurance at that. A medical bill will not knock them flat the same as it would to a poor person, whose weakening purchasing power will not allow them to buy better health insurance.
A wealthy person can get better financing on loans and mortgages, and can likely pay off their house more quickly.
Without context, comparing raw volume of money will make it look like a poor person is getting the better deal out of inflation. But this is intuitively not the case, and contextually absolutely not the case.
Even if the real return is only 4% after factoring in inflation (which was my point from the start - by investing, you can do better than just having a savings account, assuming you get average returns from stocks and such), it's still better than the poor person, who may have minimal to no savings and likely no investments.
Yes, the wealthy might pay a higher 'raw' tax on a static amount of money.
If a wealthy person has 100K in savings that is doing nothing but sitting there and a poor person has only 100, the wealthy person has a bigger blow to the purchasing power of that 100K. Obviously.
But you've ignored context the entire time, which makes you much less clever than you claim. Being wealthy gives you a host of advantages over being poor, and much more flexibility to mitigate the effects of inflation.
Reading an economics textbook doesn't make you good at economics. The purchasing power of a wealthy person is likely to rise or at least stay the same with inflation due to their ability to navigate nimbly. This is not true for a poor person. Is this not clear to you? 
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:32:02

Considering poverty is a largely arbitrary standard, it's hard to use that as a metric of success. 
What you write should be clear and understandable; clarity is always an important element of writing.
This is the first time you've brought up a specific point: 700 million out of poverty. On its face, that sounds nice - woohoo, Chinese communism. But what got them there in the first place? What is the measure of poverty? Did central planning and massive government control cause that process to go faster, or slower? What evidence is there? Would open markets and trade have accelerated that process?
China's success on the world stage is largely indisputable, but is it worth living there? Who's moving to China?

What you can buy with $50,000 now is dramatically less than you can buy in 2001 with the same amount of money. Education, healthcare, and housing have all gotten far more expensive relative to wages.

You're still not writing with any clarity. You're talking about vague benefits and advocating for central planning. Remind me, how well has that worked out for the Chinese? Get specific, because everything you're talking about now is bullshit.

Well, it did get SegWit much earlier. It has its uses.

I accepted that I lost money the moment I invested. That was always a possibility. Unlike a stock, though, I actually own some BTC now. With stock, all I can do is sell it or hold on to it or buy more if. BTC is an actual thing I can use. Yes, its value is lower, but it's still a currency.

I fail to see how the Trump administration meets any of these. What was the last conservative that really ran on limited government and private property? Conservatives have been the bigger proponents of the drug war of the two parties, which is the opposite of all these things.

It's not great sarcasm if it doesn't apply very well. Anyone who thinks, from either side, that Trump ran on this platform is deluding themselves, so what you're satirizing doesn't apply. If Trump had claimed "I'll end civil asset forfeiture! I'll strengthen private property rights!" then you'd have something, but about the only thing he ran on was being pro-business out of your little list. Hence my criticism.
