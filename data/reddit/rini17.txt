 In countries with decent internet connections, building home all-purpose Linux router on miniitx platform with Celeron and 8GB of RAM can be fun. It's under $200 especially if you use old sata harddrive lying around. In my case it handles (yes, with 5400rpm spinning rust!) fine several *coind daemons, freenet (that's actually the biggest hog), owncloud, bittorrent, Gentoo compilations, and whatnot.
No need for VPS.

And as to using SSD, if you have 4GB RAM or more, just temporarily use 3GB ramdisk. After the blockchain is downloaded, you can copy it back to HDD and use it from there. Alternatively, I got significant speedup using libeatmydata (but YMMV, that specific problem - too many sync calls - is partially fixed in 0.7 and will be fully in 0.8). 
Oh, and almost forgot: you can download most of blockchain using torrent:

Even if [the analysis]( may not be completely correct, it is still true that big majority of bitcoins is not being traded. If the price rises, they will appear on the market and push price down.

If using ram disk is not an option, and you know how to install things from source, I recommend using libeatmydata .

I think what the community is missing most is good web of trust platform. I was thinking about doing it myself, but as I have other projects to tend to at the moment, won't mind if someone other does it.
There already is WoT for [ irc channel]( and unlike bitcointalk moderation, it works well (if you know how to use it - not just blindly check the number but examine the trust graph). But it can  be better in following ways:
 * should be GPG and Bitcoin address based, so that it is posible to verify the ratings without third party
 * provide API so that it can be easily used in any service
 * API should include visual identicons so that users can quickly check that GPG or Bitcoin identity is not forged - like  .
 * highlight or otherwise prefer long-term positive ratings
 * enable multiple ratings with longer explanations including URLs, etc.
EDIT: It seems to be misunderstood, I have not in mind any kind of autoritative server, but aggregator based on existing PGP infrastructure, something like PGP keyserver on steroids.

Shortly, the "bonds" sold every month are in fact a loan to MPOE options trader on MPEx = they are used to back all issued options and MPOE has no own capital. In the end of the month after all options expire, whatever is left is returned. On one hand, the interest rate is set by lenders themselves and the market according to some specific rules, on the other hand, if the options trading was not profitable, the lenders can lose part of interest or even some principal.

When you transfer bitcoin using Satoshi client, it empties the original address(es) completely and remainder is sent to a completely new address in your wallet. This is clearly visible when you view your tx in advanced mode on blockchain.info. Until this remainder is saved in the blockchain (confirmed) together with desired transaction, you can't spend it. During this time you can spend only outputs from the addresses in your wallet, that were left untouched.

I'd recommend trying to find out how to earn bitcoins by some other way, not just mining. Everyone is mining. It may take months of time and patience lurking in the community to arrive upon actionable idea, but it's worth it. For example I decided to stick to a [certain securities exchange]( despite being reviled by some vocal "community" members, as I found their arguments lacking. Now, after few months, I have [unique codebase]( and likely the only high intensity automatic trading bot around, reaping real benefits and last laugh on recent halving day.

Hi, to invest successfully in bitcoins, you need to:
 * have good technical (or mathematical) background, or consult someone who does. So that you know exactly where technology ends and need to trust the counterparty begins.
 * monitor closely every day the bitcoin community - btctalk, and/or  irc channels and form your own opinion.
Thanks to above, I did not lost single bitcoin to scam. If you can't do it all, just buy bitcoins and save the wallet to a safe. Otherwise, there is no shortage of fundable ideas around, but also no shortage of scammers.

Use dedicated computer or android phone, either secure it properly (that if using bitcoind or bitcon-qt - they work best with persistent connection) or connect it to network only when doing transactions (and use some lightweight client).

Wonder how many people here know that 10% of these earnings were paid as dividends to shareholders. Just this month it meant ~ 5% return of the investment. Anyone can buy S.DICE shares on [MPEx]( or via its brokers/passthroughs to "play together with the house".

You didn't lose bitcoins, you can sell the shares normally. But yea, with such freakouts you'll certainly lose sometime in future, count on it ;)

One can use buy [MPEx]( BTCUSD call options. It's possible to lose initial investment at most (and that only if BTC goes below strike). If the fee to get a seat is too much, [CoinBr]( broker supports options, too.

You can trade directly on MPEx using [CoinBr]( broker. It even makes MPEx signed receipts for your orders available.
