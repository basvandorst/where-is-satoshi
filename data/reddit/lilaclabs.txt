Edit: Got it to work, turns out my LND seemed to have froze up and wasn't letting the payment route to me. Just got my 3 satoshi back lol.

Yeah not sure which bank this is but I know Chase is capable of issuing lost debit cards at their branches as long as you have your ID and can verify the info on your account. Some jankier banks probably can't do it, but a lot of banks can. Even without your bank card every bank will allow you to withdraw money as long as you go up to the teller and have your ID on you, the card is just for you to use the ATM and for purchases elsewhere.

That's what people thought about Bitcoin mining and Bitcoin fees back in the day, that it was just a waste of your electricity for worthless Bitcoin lol.

Yeah but I don't want to use a custodial wallet. Cash app will eventually implement LN so it'll probably become the biggest custodial wallet by default anyway but I'd rather control my keys.

Just got mine set up as well, though since I used my own node it took a little longer since the first node I had a channel opened to didn't really have enough connections to let me pay for anything so every payment kept failing. Had to open a second channel to a much better connected node and now things seem to be working.
Was a bit of a struggle to get the node working right, seems like there may be some performance or port issues with Bitcoin Core still since LND kept getting booted off of the node with a weird port already in use error even though nothing else uses the Bitcoin Core RPC port. Had to manually run tweak things to get it working right. Whole thing took me about a day of tweaking. I assume it'll be a lot smoother in the future though, but I really didn't want to use a custodial wallet.
