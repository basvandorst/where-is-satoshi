1. You fed people by converting the coins, right? Or did someone accept coins for food?
2. What difference did bitcoin make versus a regular donation?
3. How did the volatility effect your donations? By the time you used/converted were they worth more or less?
These are the questions those skeptical (I'm not) of bitcoin would ask, which is why I think we should be careful when attributing bitcoin to successes without qualifying how bitcoin played a role.

Why so much drama over it then? Just post what you bought / sold at and everyone who gives a shit can follow it themselves. Otherwise you're just another pizza index.
You highly doubt that 30k movement had an impact on something traded so thinly? Hrm...
Hey guys I mined s few hundred I'm gonna start  thread where I take the current valuation and multiply it times the amount I have!!!!!! Hurrrrr

You might as well say they're registered and regulated by Cap'n Crunch to protect the securities from going soggy, was the point.
According to the US government, the governing body that matters when selling securities to US citizens, they are unregulated and unregistered. It's pretty simple.
Also, you're confusing who said what. Unless you are assuming noagendamarket = lucasjkr...

Anyone (who has a computer and the Internet) can transact with anyone else (who has a computer and the Internet), anywhere (that is Internet accessible) in the world.

Ask all of the online poker sites "why this move" 
One year ago, on April 15, 2011, the poker world was rocked when federal authorities unsealed an indictment against online poker’s big three: PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker. The charges were based on the Illegal Gambling Business Act of 1955 and the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 and alleged that the companies used fraudulent methods to circumvent federal law and trick banks into processing payments.
Read more: 
Now granted, the "fraudulent methods" were essentially going to those poker sites, paying with visa and then getting charged by things like 123 Playstation Store or something vague, which then in turn funded your chips on those sites. 
That's a key distinction from the poker sites, you don't do the conversion AT sdice. 
Who wants to "test the law" that could conveniently claim there is zero difference between that and buying / mining BTC then gambling with BTC in the eyes of the gov. 
As was said, the US's terms of what is acceptable changes to meet convenient needs.

Is this a serious question? Because the answer is fairly obviously yes.

I'd say they're behind it. Waaaay, wayyyyyyyy behind it

There could be 1 bitcoin total, and when folks initially mined they received .00000005 instead of 50. Do you not see that that's arbitrary.
Wallets decaying is arbitrary as well. You can never prove how much or if any is decayed or just being stored, so all you go on is liquidity. How many people have established what valuations of it, how many solid, consistent dollar to btc services are there  that help establish valuation, etc...

I believe the idea here is not accepting something when it's a fucking hassle and will deteriorate interest in it via crappy systems and methodologies. Not talking about perfecting software, talking about creating user-centered solutions to problems.
There is a massive problem with the current 'using bitcoins in a bar.' 
Hooray for pioneers, but lots of pioneers died on the trail "innovating."

oh, i'm sorry, that slight issue with how every single food service industry employee is largely paid.

Ego much? I think the goal here is avoiding your lead and doing it right. 
yeah you accept bitcoins but its far from ideal, even detrimental to bitcoins, work towards a solution that doesn't suck, grats for being first out of the gate though, I suppose.

If I saw that flyer in the street it would lower my opinion of bitcoin. Also I assume that wallet is yours just in case someone would donate? Sure, I'll print it out right away! Zzz.

Explain how you think it will apply. What does it mean for acc returns to apply to bitcoins.

Make the anonymous crypto currency that funds assassination markets and Silk Road more suspicious?
Gosh I'm pretty sure the detectives at  have figured out its utility for evasion and laundering...

In other words this douche back pedaled on his initial rabble rousing stance on bitcoins, proving his opinion is invalid.
