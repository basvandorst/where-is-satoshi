It's not a stock.

Reach out to Coinbase support

Unfortunately if you're buying from an exchange, you'll have to comply with know your customer laws.
@_date: 2017-01-27 03:26:04
What a waste of money.

GDAX (Coinbase's exchange) has similar fees. When you buy from Coinbase directly, of course it's a lot more expensive.

But that's the thing. Those who hold bitcoin as an investment should be looking at this in the long term. There will be a lot of volatility, but major drops that occur over days will not matter in a year or two years. If you speculate instead of invest and monitor the price  constantly, all it will do is stress you out. If you want to invest, invest. Set it and forget it. If you want to speculate, then maybe this isn't for you.

buy a fireproof safe and put a trezor in it
@_date: 2017-01-04 04:40:27
@_date: 2017-01-30 00:27:11
Gemini or GDAX
@_date: 2017-01-03 06:51:25
No, I just did an instant buy an hour ago.
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:59:29
Cold Storage (ie: trezor)
@_date: 2017-01-09 05:43:10
They'll also take a bank statement with your address.
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:40:48
Whatever the price of Bitcoin was when you bought it, that's what you'll get. So if you bought it before the crash.

Over 9000
@_date: 2017-01-08 02:38:06
It's called Coinigy
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:43:34
Yea, it usually takes a week to process on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-01-05 06:02:16
Cold storage would be more safe (ie: Trezor)
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:18:30
bread wallet
@_date: 2017-01-07 07:10:30
There are winners and losers when speculating. Honestly, I'm not too concerned that there was a massive sell off. I plan to buy and hold for a long time. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:47:56
They could move that money to GDAX and buy on the market.

Cold Storage would be the most secure in terms of wallet, but I would recommend bread wallet as an alternative. Personally, I like to store the bulk of my coins in Cold Storage and then use a hot wallet such as bread wallet to contain a small fraction that can be reloaded whenever.
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:23:45
Cold Storage - I highly recommend Trezor.

I use them as an exchange. I have no complaints. I wish they would increase their ACH limits ($500) per day.
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:22:35
Gemini is pretty decent
@_date: 2016-12-29 02:34:28
If you have a few bitcoins, you should move them off Coinbase and into Cold Storage.
