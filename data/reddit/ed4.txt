You will look back 10 years from now and you'll realize THIS is the dip, buy now, the difference between buying at 12K or 9K won't make you any richer.

Considering the majority of the world has $0 on savings (or even negative). Hodling 0.01 BTC is a privilege.

That's snail internet speed. Chill and wait until it finishes.

It's a mix of DCA, consecutive n amount of the same candle color, biweekly, Fibonacci chicken bones, FOMTD (fear of missing the dip) and other market signs.

Red candle? I buy. Green candle? I hodl. 
I'm a simple man.

It's a comic, it's using hyperbole arguments. Idiots today believe the earth is flat, I totally believe 500 years ago people thought it was flat because all they could see was flat.

So be wise and keep on stacking...
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:25:37
It's not a bull run, until it is. 
Keep on stacking regardless.

There's not a lot of people with 1BTC. In the grand scheme of things, 21M out of whatever the world population is today, that is insignificant. And out of those 21M I guess even a smaller fraction own 1BTC or more.

Yummy spicy dip, tastes so good.

Taxable event even if selling at a loss? What if don't declare the loss? Just as important as a gain?

Go to coinbase (website) and they show how many days remaining are left until the funds are available. For pro doesn't take longer, but you have to put the money first.
@_date: 2019-07-03 06:46:23
Buying at 10K or 13K is not much of a difference, unless you put millions into Bitcoin, you will hardly see a difference if we reach a new ATH, maybe a few hundred dollars? Buy now and hold until we hit 10M BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:59:02
Higher than having your coins out of there. Not your keys, not your coins. Also, the government can also come knocking their door and confiscate their assets, it has happened in the past (gold), can happen again.
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:58:39
I buy 9K 8K 7K, bring the spicy dip!

Somebody breaks into your house, they will take the first thing that looks like a collectible. You have to hide it in something mundane.

None of what you said makes sense. They're trying to stop Libra which might legitimatize cryptocurrencies in the eyes of the public, be mass adopted and make Bitcoin more valuable? I don't think so.
@_date: 2019-07-04 19:14:59
What's wrong with it? I bought mine from Amazon (official trezor store) and I did a thorough analysis of the wallet and seems to be legit.
I checked the seal and packaging and compared it to the one they show on their website, seems official as well, and was really hard to peel off, so very likely it wasn't peeled off before.
I also flashed the new firmware and then transferred a small amount of BTC to it and let it there for a week (waiting in case it was indeed fake) and nothing happened, then I transferred my remaining Bitcoin and everything is still there. This doesn't guarantee anything but it's a good sign.
It's okay to be paranoid, but at least be an informed paranoid.
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:17:51
I meant to say, higher than being hacked under his control.
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:24:18
I was taking your comment seriously.

Do calculations until your calculation finds a magical string and you get your reward.

I was able to use ACH still not a long time ago, I think you can't buy if you use any type of card. But yes, they were dumb by not specifying that on their tweet.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:05:19
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:15:10
It just shows how Libra will never be able to compete with Bitcoin. They have to ask for permission, they have to go through regulations, they can't make promises like not printing as many ZuckBucks as they want and they just basically said they can control to some extent what people do with Libra. None of that applies to Bitcoin.

Here comes the other end of Bart's head! Brace for impact!

A qué te dedicas ahora en Peru? Tú familia corre riesgo en Venezuela? Regresarás a minar bitcoins? (Supongo que ya no por lo caro). Qué le paso a tus criptomonedas y billeteras? Movieron las monedas hacia otros lugares? 
 Saludos y espero te encuentres bien.
@_date: 2019-07-04 01:11:48
What's a good dip for you? I said it before but I don't think we will see anything below $9K for a while, unless drastic events occur.
@_date: 2019-07-04 20:46:32
They don't even need to be hacked, US government or any other government (wherever your exchange is) can come knocking on your door "party is over guys! We'll take it from here, Bitcoin not allowed!" And there goes all your coins. Not your keys, not your coins.
@_date: 2019-07-04 01:13:18
How do you know they won't try to get their Bitcoin back? I recommend instead to do some googling and trust no one.

@_date: 2019-07-08 07:38:17
You know, Bitcoin doesn't revolve around the US, there are other shitty governments out there too that can ban Bitcoin.

I like how he says sarcastically in Japanese that he's not Satoshi. Makes you wonder. And the end of the video, basically: DCA.

This was so cringey to read. Please leave.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:08:36
I had close to $2K dollars around that time to buy whatever I wanted. I was very into bitorrent and P2P technologies, but not Bitcoin. What a shame.
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:03:57
Regulations or government ban of cryptocurrencies. If you don't control your keys, you don't own your coins.
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:54:29

No soy argentino, pero probablemente tengas que declarar tú ganancia. Tendras que revisar el codigo legal que rige en Argentina.
"There is no specific capital gains tax in Argentina; however, there is a 9% to 35% tax for fiscal residents on their world revenues, including capital gains." Citation is needed though.

What does he gain from saying publicly 10 instead of 5?

This is it, buckle up, bulls are running and can't be stopped.
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:51:30
More than two weeks ago [I predicted the 13K - 9K price range]( and it went to 13K and now back to 9K and nobody has given me internet points so far. Good luck.
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:45:11
I guess panic sell is worse than panic buy, at least with the second you still have a chance to recover, but once you sell, it's done.
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:50:56
I laughed.

Green candle? I hodl. Red candle? I buy.
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:58:00
Because you will be buying the lambo with btc, not selling to buy with fiat.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:38:42
To have tripled your money at this point, you'd have to have bought at $4500, not a lot of people bought at that point.
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:28:08
Right on time with my DCA schedule. Bring that spicy dip please.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:34:54
Why it crashed, not why was pumped.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:05:28
Stable for now at 12.4K for now. We'll see.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:21:05
What do you mean your HDD fried? The magnetic plates are still functional? Just replace the electronics and get it running?
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:35:25
I don't think we will see 6K for a very long time unless something drastic happens. Get used to 9-13K in the coming months and buy NOW.
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:54:12
I bought at 14K in 2017 I saw some gains while holding then I saw it drop to 3K during last year, never once thought about selling. Last week I was close to getting my money back (when it reached almost 14K again) but I'm gonna keep holding until moon.
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:17:54
If you're positive the hdd has remained untouched, make a copy of the hard drive before you try to do any recovery, in case you mess up the original.
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:52:30
If you're willing to not have a life and frustrate every second you get wrecked by price swings, then yes, you can get some gains.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:45:40
Yeah many did at that point, but compared to the amount of people is trying to buy right now or did in this last week? Back then the sentiment wasn't that bullish.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:46:38
Flash sale is over guys. Thanks for coming.
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:35:46
Probably Zucks payroll. Praising Libra so much.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:26:44
I would've sent that hard drive for forensic repairs. Hard drives are usually well sealed.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:04:26
I bought at 14K in 2017 and I'm still hodling strong, and you want to sell already? Come on people.
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:46:22
Bitcoin crashing down to 20K? It's over for Bitcoin!
