I like Ansel Lindner's idea of using "Finneys," or 1/10,000 of 1 BTC.  It's halfway between 1 BTC and 1 satoshi, and 1 Finney would be $1.66 right now.
Not sure if it was Ansel who came up with the nomenclature, but he's who I heard it from &amp; the idea makes sense to me.

I would wager my life savings that both Bitmagnet and BitKing are scams.
Bitmagnet claims 12% daily returns at the lowest tier. 1.12^365 means that 1 year's investment of 1 bitcoin would yield 9.2 x 10^17 bitcoins.  Pretty impressive, since only 16 million and change exist right now.
As a rule of thumb, anything that guarantees a return greater than what you can get on a bond investment of similar duration is scammy.

Problem with this is that it's based on Bitcoin Core cira 2015, so no segwit signalling :-(

I've experimented with the core wallet and a bunch of SPV wallet, as well as Ledger Nano and Trezor hardware wallets. 
I run the core wallet as a full node to support the network, but never really liked it as a wallet. 
I'd recommend Trezor or Ledger Nano.  One thing that I really like is that the backup phrase is compatible with other wallet providers...i.e., if you lost your Nano, you can restore your funds via Mycelium or Coinomi.

A disproportionate number of BTU nodes are run on "Hetzner Online GmbH AS24940", which is a cheap AWS-like hosting service.

The relative values are far more important IMHO.  If combined altcoin market cap doubled, and bitcoin's market cap increased ten-fold, it'd be hard to interpret that as altcoins growing AND eating bitcoin's lunch.

Medium-term hodler here, still hodling.  I think Chinacoin is a huge filibuster.
I was just on Ledger's website, and there's a notice on the homepage saying:
*The Ledger Nano (classic) and HW.1 products will be soon definitely out of stock. 
Please order now if you wish to get one of the last items (Nano S and Blue are fully stocked)*
Seems like many others are continuing to buy/hodl.  Well, either that, or many people are moving their coins to hardware wallets as a safety measure.

I remember Andreas saying that ASIC manufacturing technology has now hit Moore's Law, so now hashes/watt will double every year or two, rather than every few months as it has been for the last several years. 
Anyone think that this will have an effect on the commoditization and/or decentralization of mining hardware?

1. I see, I wasn't thinking about USAF.
2. I see.  Is setting up your own mining rig and mining on a pool much more technically difficult than setting up a full node?
3. Makes sense

Thanks for the info Aussiehash.
I'm more tech savvy than my contemporaries, but probably less so than the average full-node running bitcoiner.
Is just having a full node running on a Windows PC adequate for this, or do I have to be running a Bitcore server for this to work?

I run a full node to support the network, and would be willing to mine at a loss for the same reason.
Wouldn't it take a lot more than 200k Avalon 6 miners to reach the 95% threshold though?  Current SegWit support is around 30% (about 1 exahash).  Each Avalon 6 would be 3.5 terahash, and 200k would be 0.7 exahash.
(1 + 0.7) / (3.2 + 0.7) ~~~ 44%
I want SegWit adopted ASAP, but it'd take a lot more than you proposed.  By my math, to get to 95% signalling, and assuming F2Pool starts signalling, it'd take 9.3 million Avalon 6's.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:42:52
Fees would shrink after a BTU HF block increase too...I'm figuring that miners' opposition to segwit is for 2 reasons:
1) They're worried about losing fees to segwit-enabled second layer solutions 
2) Segwit was developed by Core, and is thus "fruit from the poisonous tree,"  so will be rejected regardless of actual or perceived benefits.

Glad to read this.  Looks like Milan is siding with the Canadians.  Anyone know if there's a good source that lists which companies/organizations have taken such a stance?
My list so far: Bitpay, Canadian Bitcoin Economic Nodes, Blockchainlab in Milan
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:21:31
Good idea...I already run a full node at a small loss, and I'd be willing to add some hashpower to the network for decentralization purposes, even at a loss.

I looked around the Trezor user manual, couldn't find any info on it.
there's a field where you can edit "Bitcore Server URL" and "Explorer URL".  Would the IP address of your full node go in the "Bitcore Server URL"?

I get the psychological aspect of the USD price of 1 bitcoin exceeding the price of 1 troy ounce of gold, but it is kind of arbitrary.  Their market caps are far from parity...what's at parity is the atomic units of what we happen to have chosen to quote.
Consider if 2 companies, ABC and XYZ were each trading at $100 a share and each had a market cap of $1 million.  If XYZ did a 2:1 split, the market caps would still be equal...meaning that they each still represent an equal share of the market.  However, their prices would no longer be at parity.  To the uninitiated, ABC would be worth twice as much as XYZ.

It's not at the protocol level, but BitGo offers instant payments if one's interested in zero-confirmation purchases.  The caveat is that the merchant has to be set up for BitGo instant payments.  Also, you have to be ok with having bitcoin on a third party's web wallet...I'd feel comfortable with holding small amounts required for online or in-person purchases.

Jonny1000...I thought you did a great job in the debate with Roger a few months back.  I appreciate your contributions to the community. 
I'm a non-technical user.  I run a full node (most current Core software) and am considering mining at a loss to contribute to the SegWit hashpower.
It seems to me that a contentious BU HF would not be in anyone's best interest, including BU's.  Also, BU/EC has been publicly admonished by several influential organizations/project leaders (Armory, Blockchainlab in Milan, Canadian Bitcoin Economic Nodes, et al), who have said that if a HF occurs, the BTU token would be treated as an altcoin.
When you say that we need to be prudent and treat these threats seriously, what do you think would be the most prudent actions to take for (1) the pro-Core/anti-contentious HF community, and (2) me, as a hodler and bitcoin advocate? 
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:43:02
FUD...it's all just posturing.
As Andreas put it in one of his recent videos, actually doing this would be "cutting of their head in spite of their face."
(Empty) threats of this, however, are being utilized in hopes of manipulating public opinion.

1.  My bad...I'm confusing you with the Jonny that debated Roger at Anarchopulco a few months ago. 
2. &amp; 5. Good ideas
3. I wouldn't ever keep any bitcoin on Coinbase...cold storage only for &gt;90% of my holdings. It's frustrating that the CTO of Coinbase, Charlie Lee, is so rational in his support of segwit and opposition of Chinacoin, yet the other Coinbase executives pander to that nonsense.
4. Good idea, I bet in-person lobbying would be most effective.  Unfortunately I live on the East Coast  (of US).

The only way to know would be if there was a database of pre-existing wallets to check your new wallet against, so long as everyone that ever generated a wallet entered theirs into that database, which they probably wouldn't.
We aren't used to considering numbers that are on the scale of the number of potential private keys (or wallet seeds). There are 2048 words in the bip-39 word list, and wallets typically use 24 word seed phrases. 2048 to the 24th power is about 3 x 10\^79, or 3 with 79 zeros after it.
There is somewhere around 10\^20 grains of sand on earth. Picking the same 24 words as another person would be as likely as picking the same 4 grains of sand on earth.
Here's a great video on the topic: [

I don't think people are waiting on the edge of their seats for this SEC decision. They were on the edge of their seats for the March decision, but the price rebounded pretty quickly after the dip. 
Also, the price drop that followed a week or so after the March decision was more related the perceived BU fork risk, IMHO.

I just got my first order of Opendime(s) today...cool device. I ordered these without the intention to have a use for them, rather just to toy around with.
There are basically two uses that an Opendime could fulfill for me:
1) Cold-storage hardware device for myself
2) Gifting bitcoin to friends/family
I wouldn't use it for (1) because I can't back it up in multiple locations, as I can do with a Trezor/Ledger/Mycelium/Coinomi/Electrum BIP39 mnemonic phrase. I'd also worry that something would happen to the circuitry and render it useless, with no way to restore it.
Also, I wouldn't use it for (2) because when I gift bitcoin to friends/family, who are nearly clueless about good key storage habits, I give it as a paper wallet that I hold a backup copy to. I realize that this eliminates the bearer instrument property of the gift, since I could spend from that address behind their back &amp; without their knowledge. However, I feel that it's in the best interest of preserving the spendability of the gift should they lose it.
Another fear would be that I'd give my friend's newborn an Opendime with 0.5 BTC on it, and when they go to redeem it in 18 years (when 0.5 BTC is worth a lot more), the drive is blank due to aging or static electricity or something.
I get the properties that it's aspiring to (bearer usb stick) but I can't really think of a genuine use case for me at this point. Maybe if bitcoin is more well know in the future and Opendime has more recognizability, I could get some use out of one.

Once you buy bitcoin, there's basically 2 ways that you can store it:
* **Custodial Wallet-** i.e. Coinbase, Kraken, Poloniex, Bitfinex. The company holding your bitcoin has control of it. You don't really own the bitcoin, what you own is essentially that company's promise to send you the bitcoin when you request it...there have been many cases where people got shafted because their custodial account got hacked (Bitfinex, Mt. Gox), the operators of the site vanished (Cryptsy, several dark net markets), or the operators of the site chose to freeze the account (i.e. Coinbase gets it in their head that you're using bitcoin to gamble or for dark net markets, or they receive a subpoena to freeze your account). Only that entity who runs your wallet can send bitcoin from that address. You're dependent on the operator's whims and security practices for the safety of your money.
* **Your Own Wallet-** i.e. Mycelium, Trezor, Ledger, KeepKey, Bitcoin Core, paper wallet, Coinomi. In the case of these wallets, *you, and you alone* possess the power to send your bitcoin. By holding your bitcoin this way, you're taking advantage of several features that aren't possible with a custodial wallet, such as censorship resistance and confiscation resistance. 
BTW, when I say private key, every bitcoin address has a public address ( ie 1eLPyjqP8PKXTDHUmwwzCDGc59VT5tQQW) and a private key (ie 5K7mFpXFr5PYZv3JNrVdhGe9wNTHL8U4BfvJ47dC6XbpiMivyDC). If someone knows the public address, they can send bitcoin to that address. If someone knows the private key, they can spend bitcoin from that address (fyi, if you know the private key, you can always generate a public address from it if need be).
Hope that cleared it up. Here's some videos that serve as a good starting point if you want to go further down the rabbit hole:

I'd be interested to see the difference in public sentiment during the P2SH UASF compared to the current one. 
That one seemed to occur cleanly, without any issues. Presumably, the miners would've been against that one too, otherwise it would've been a MASF.
I wasn't in bitcoin at that time, so I'm not quite sure of the details...
