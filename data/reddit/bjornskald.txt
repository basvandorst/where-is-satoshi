I have the cloak of immunity. Sorry you lose.

That is a very good point my friend. 
People in today's economy vote with their dollars, but not enough people have the dollars required to vote. So basically only the wealthy get to decide the direction of things.
That would change significantly with the Freedom Dividend.

Get fucked.
@_date: 2019-08-11 01:16:18
So given the 2020 choices who are you voting for to achieve these things you dream of?

We live in a society .
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:37:31
Corporations can't keep getting away with paying nothing while people are starving and being foreclosed on.
Why are you so happy to give breaks to big business but not to the people who really need them?
Without the people, the businesses can't succeed.
It's meant to be a mutually beneficial relationship, but it's very one sided in America and has been that way for way too long. And it shows. They know that America is the richest and best country to do business in, they're not going anywhere.

You're right, I let my troll side come out when I see trolls.
I'd like to see some drastic changes to America's policies. We've been slowly floating and stagnant for too long. If his policies induced BTC to soar and a tech surge then I think that could only be good for America in the long run.

Okay god, what are the solutions to humans problems?
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:04:50
They're already doing what they want to do. And Americans are struggling to make ends meet. You're missing the point here.
Either we help American citizens or we fuck citizens over and help the wealthy elite.

Doomsayer you sound like the crazy old man shouting "the end is nigh!"

How do you think he makes it into a larger money machine?
@_date: 2019-08-10 23:29:00
Big oof
That does NOT account for the number of people who are literally unemployed. 
That does not account for people who are underemployed.
It's a great number to throw around but is not painting a full picture.
 watch this
@_date: 2019-08-11 01:47:05
If you take money from A and give it to B
Where A are rich corporations that sit on a large portion of their wealth
and B are hundreds of millions of citizens who are also consumers of goods and services...
Then I don't think you're being fair in your explanation.
@_date: 2019-08-11 04:55:32
Selfless service?
@_date: 2019-08-10 23:51:58
How is reality emotional propaganda? Why do you not have an answer to my question? 
What do you say to those families who are literally facing eviction and struggling to survive?
@_date: 2019-08-11 01:19:58
Bruh you know America is already socialist and we aren't "living in commie hell"?
K-12 education is paid for by taxes
Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, etc...
These are all socialist policies. 
Big banks being bailed out ???? socialism.
Why are you afraid of these things that already exist?
@_date: 2019-08-11 01:26:47
Why aren't any politicians on board or popular with your proposals? Are you running for office?
What gives?
If it's so effective to do, then why isn't it being done or popularized by any politicians/candidates?
@_date: 2019-08-11 01:33:06
Do you believe that people vote with their dollars?
When they don't have power to spend (because they don't have money to spend) then they don't have power to vote?
Giving a buffer to the lower and middle class allows them to contribute more to the economy and that, in turn, creates stimulation in the markets.

He addresses some of your concerns with education.
@_date: 2019-08-10 23:36:35
You aren't understanding the metric used to calculate "unemployment rate" if you haven't seen that video then watch it, it explains it well.
@_date: 2019-08-10 21:02:52
 whaaaaaat?
Is someone triggered for no reason?
@_date: 2019-08-10 23:48:44
You admit the cost of living is increasing?
What do you say to the families who have only one income, let's say a tradesman who's business is failing and they cannot continue making rent payments because they're unable to find work?
They should just lose everything and their family should be driven from their home?
When they apply for work, they don't get responses. They're in their 50's and they're overlooked in favor of younger candidates.
This is a reality for a lot of people. You're pretending the easy answer is easy. "Just get a job you bum". 
Because $10 an hour or even $15 an hour is going to pay for all of the bills and late fees and debt that has been accrued over time as a result of always living paycheck to paycheck and having electricity cut off etc...
You're grossly underestimating how many Americans are struggling, underpaid, and underemployed.
