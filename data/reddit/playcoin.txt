BitcoinVideoPlayer.com  will be launching this week, The bitcoin pv platform will only charge 1 % for it's service , not counting normal mining fees which will be added at time of ppv purchase.
Instead of being a prepay service ( as we previously announced ), the 1% fee will be taking out at time of bitcoin remittance and sent to content owners. 
We are testing the changes to the platform's launch deprecating from the prepay model. 
These changes will be implemented and launch will be this week . 
We expect , at the latest with be a 3 day delay of launch putting launch by this Friday the 21st. So please do prepay anything and stay tuned for our launch this week.

The platform bitcoin enables your existing video. You submit your video ( hosted elsewhere )
( private , not a public shared video ..defeats the purpose) .
Upon submission which includes the price and bitcoin address for payment to be sent...
The system generates a widget that you copy and paste where ever you wish. That simple.
If you have a library , then you create a csv file of your library and then the system will import it in your account and creates your widget and provides link to the ppv video.
That simple :)

That is what we are asking the community , to help promote bitcoin in FB . 
What would the community wish the app to do to help promote mass adoption of bitcoin in FB. So many are not aware of what bitcoin is.
 So , unless an app with that name is built and searchable in FB, then using it to educate users about it is not going to be as effective. It could be launched for greed purposes by someone else ..but we wish to do as Mt.Gox did when they trademarked 'bitcoin' . use it for the benefit of adoption of the ecosystem and keep it out of hands that would wish to profit from it. Any suggestions as to accomplish building it as an educational app for mass adoption is appreciated.
