Great, yet another stupid service for buying bitcoins. The biggest problem these days is that it's extremely easy to get a hold of coins but much harder to sell them for fiat money. Whose problem are you solving with this exactly?

But we already have that. This news is net positive for bitcoin and yet you have thousands of stupid traders dumping coins and depressing the price by more than 10% in one day for no good reason. If anything, institutional investors are going to bring more capital into bitcoin and that will make the price more resistant to volatility.

How is that different from gold? Gold is worth something just because a bunch of humans agreed it's pretty and shiny and worth something. Saying that bitcoin is not backed by anything is a fallacy; it is well backed by faith that people have in it and mining/hashing power (expenditure of energy) behind it. If people were to decide that gold is worthless from today, would it still really retain its original value?
Also, I don't think you understand what 'fiat' means. Fiat money can arbitrarily be printed and have its value changed by a tiny group of powerful people. The Latin word 'fiat' means 'let it be'. There is no one single entity that can arbitrarily bring more bitcoins into existence and reduce the value of your holdings by doing that. In order to create more bitcoins 'out of nothing', you need processing power and energy. It's much more similar to actual gold mining that printing money out of thin air.

Let me ask you one thing: why not examine the negative side effects of all the things you purport America does for the benefit of the world? Do you believe that the means justify the ends?
Don't you think that many people around the world dislike the idea of having an imperialist superpower meddling into their affairs? Don't you think they have the right to sovereignty and being left alone?
I don't believe for a second that America does all these things for the benefit of others, as you claim, but let's do a thought exercise and assume for a second that it does. Hasn't the Iraq war left that country much worse off than it initially was? What about Afghanistan?

The whole concept of difficulty readjustment is premised on the fact that miners should act rational and turn off their equipment when mining becomes unprofitable, until the production cost of 1 BTC reaches the amount of money expended on mining that same coin. The reason why they're bleeding money is because they're unwilling to adjust their mining operations.
It's akin to mining gold at an unprofitable mine and expending $2000/oz, when the spot price is ~$1300 or whatever. It's completely irrational, pure and simple. No better than burning money.

The block chain grows at what, some 10GB/year? Right now I can pick up a 4TB (4000GB) drive for $150. That means that it would take ~400 years to fill a cheap consumer hard drive with the block chain. I know that the tx rate is going to scale up in the future, but it's still a non-issue.
As for bandwidth, it's possible to torrent the bootstrap file for the whole chain which dramatically decreases the initial setup time. I'm sure that in the future there will be services that will sell pre-loaded drives with the block chain, which will also make this a non-issue.

@_date: 2014-03-23 06:51:15
I had to downvote not because I disagree, but because you are factually wrong. In the bitcoin economy a disproportionate amount of coins is being held by parties who got hold of them by various illegal means - often outright theft from the exchanges they were operating, hacking, phishing and so on. I don't even have anything against guys who made their wealth selling drugs since I believe that doing drugs is a personal choice, but creating wealth for yourself by stealing from other people is unacceptable.
Guys like Karpeles and that Australian guy who stole from his exchange are already sitting on millions or hundreds of millions of dollars. Can you imagine how wealthy they are going to be if bitcoin really takes off as a currency? Outright thieves are going to be some of the richest and most powerful people in the world. That's not the kind of world I want to live in and if that's the way it has to be, then I'd rather see bitcoin utterly fail than these guys getting away with it and living like kings until their time is up. Yes, I'd rather see the old system banksters and their crony politicians in power than guys like Karpeles. Of course, it would be ideal if guys like Karpeles and Zhou Tong just got arrested and put away for life and bitcoin still took off.
I don't like the old system any more than you do, but try to keep things in perspective.

I am completely perplexed as to why people insist on using services like Coinbase as wallets.
The thing about bitcoin is that it is DECENTRALIZED and its whole value proposition is that you can send bitcoins from anywhere, to anyone and without anyone's permission as long as you have your private keys. Why you people are reinventing traditional banks with Coinbase is totally beyond me. Is it that difficult to go to blockchain.info and creating an account?

Precisely. I'd love to have a small mining operation at home in order to help the network. The problem is, it's completely unprofitable at these levels.

@_date: 2014-08-03 08:16:27
My point is that just because some "law" was written down on a piece of paper somewhere, it doesn't endow it with an aura of moral legitimacy. All kinds of absurd laws existed throughout the human history and many of those laws were barbaric, violent and outright morally wrong. Not 70 years ago, it was the law that hiding Jews from the German authorities was illegal and punishable; shortly before that it was completely illegal to consume liquor in the US; did the fact that it was "the law" make those things right and moral? At some point burning women at the stake for "witchcraft" was also the law.
If we just take "the law" at face value, then every law is inherently legitimate, simply by virtue of someone with enough guns and swords proclaiming so. So if our internal moral compass makes those laws illegitimate, then why stop at only certain laws? Why not switch to our reason and morality for determining what we should and shouldn't obey? Why wait for armed men to tell us what's right and wrong?
I do understand what you mean though when you say that we need some kind of compromise (I'll be the first to say that people aren't perfect and most of them are certainly not very intelligent). I agree with that, but I also think we can push back against unreasonable demands and help steer the societal values in the right direction, instead of simply shrugging and accepting the status quo.


The woods aren't necessary. There are always different societies with different laws in this world and it's fairly easy to move elsewhere if you disagree with the laws of any particular place (in fact, that's exactly what I did).

Fair enough. I'm not very familiar with your field so when you said that the field is extremely competitive, I assumed you were talking about hiring cheap labor (some people hire illegal immigrants to work on construction projects, it seems to be pretty popular nowadays). As for coding, it is actually a huge spectrum and on one extreme you have kids writing HTML websites and invoicing apps, and on the other you have computer scientists with PhDs building insanely complicated cloud infrastructures (just as an example).
Yeah I don't think that terminating someone for asking to be paid in BTC is very reasonable. It looks like a largely emotional decision that would bring no benefit to either party. It's enough to shoot them down and only resort to firing if they get obnoxious and argumentative about it (which demonstrates a lack of intelligence, obviously). I think it's ok for people to just ask, it doesn't hurt anyone and it's part of the negotiation process and price discovery.

It is perfectly possible to generate a safe brainwallet pass phrase. There are a lot of people on this sub who love talking about information entropy and all that without even understanding how the concept works. The concept of entropy is closely related to the concepts of search space.
For instance, let's imagine you don't understand what a car is. If my brainwallet was a word taken from the information space of car names, that would be trivial to crack for someone who knows the search space in advance but it would provide no entropy reduction to someone who doesn't understand what the hell a car is.
In other words, if something is known to me and only me (e.g. a specific memory with personal information mixed in) and you don't know the search space, reversing the hash will be as hard as trying to reconstruct it randomly. If an entropy reduction event doesn't occur, you have no hope of guessing a sufficiently complex pass phrase.
And as for 2FA and BIP38, it introduces the issue of having to physically have your paper wallet. What if you find yourself in a fucked up situation and all you have is a cell phone? I wouldn't want to be locked out of my funds like that. The cost of using BIP38 outweighs the benefits if your brainwallet is safe enough.

@_date: 2014-06-26 15:51:26


I understand your points well but I guess it comes down to whether you value ease of use over security or vice versa. And I'm of the opinion that if your brainwallet is secure enough, BIP38 adds no value (by secure I mean something that only your brain can construct, not obscure poems in Afrikaans).
Furthermore, I like having the ability to spend my coins just by passing my pass phrase into the sha256 function. Nothing is needed except a Linux terminal and my brain. The more factors you have, the easier it is to lock yourself out of your funds (either temporarily or permanently).
For example, if I was about to create a new brainwallet right now, I'd create a string of this kind:
My brother in law's name + my grandma's birthday + the exact yyyy-MM-dd-hh-mm timestamp of my birthday + make and model of the car that my uncle drove in '95 + a made up word that I used to use as a toddler etc...
Looks pretty safe to me and all I have to do is remember the concatenation order of the information I already know. This is not completely unbreakable but I think we can agree it's virtually unbreakable.

Has it ever occurred to you that most, if not all, of these things would've emerged in a free market system regardless? It's a fallacy to assume that just because they were invented in the current system, that they wouldn't have emerged in a different system (and possibly even faster and more efficiently).
Plus I'd love to hear how ECC is a direct result of government funding and intervention. To my knowledge, it was independently invented by two university professors who likely would've come up with certain solutions even if they hadn't been employed by publicly funded institutions at the time. Correlation != causation.

Don't change the subject, this particular discussion was about the legality of "forfeiture".

There's absolutely nothing wrong with retaliating against someone who is actively working against your interests, and I think it's fair to say that GHash is working against the interests of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin community. If you're wondering how they're doing that, it's by creating centralization and thus making people lose confidence in Bitcoin and causing them to dump their coins and crash the price (and in the long run, slow down adoption across the board).
On a more selfish level, my holdings today are worth less than yesterday because of GHash and their deliberate shenanigans. I have zero problems with people attacking them in all sorts of manners.

You can't choose a competing company because the state is engaging into protectionism and crony-capitalism, whereby a private company can get an exclusive monopoly on providing a specific service. In true free-market capitalism, any company would be allowed to start laying down water pipes and start competing with other service providers. It would likely increase the overall quality of service and improve the price discovery mechanism.
Otherwise, I agree that extreme mindsets and philosophies are neither good or helpful. While I do think that free-market capitalism with minimal government interference is the future of the western civilization, it's a slow process that will likely take a long time to have any major effect.

No, you are the one missing the point here. Money is a medium of exchange as much as it's a store of value. Both are intrinsic properties of money that co-exist at the same time. Even if the whole world started using a currency that has built-in demurrage, people would just get fed up with constantly being forced to spend their money and eventually they'd keep all their wealth in physical assets and convert only when they want to spend... which kind of invalidates the whole concept because the store of value will just shift to other types of assets. Nothing will have been achieved.

First of all, have a beer for being polite and civil and not resorting to name calling, unlike many other posters in this thread. When libertarians rail against the state, I don't think they're necessarily against all types of cooperative organizations where members voluntarily agree on certain rules. I think it's a matter of scale and that a lot of anti-state people would be perfectly happy with a small, limited, self-contained organization that exists to make sure that its community members can agree on certain things. I'm of the opinion that a lot of libertarians are against big smoke &amp; mirrors apparatuses that end up extracting rent from the society, instead of working for it.
Maybe the propensity of such organizations to extract rent and engage into violence is a direct function of their size. If that's the case, then keeping them small and extremely limited in scope would be the answer.

Not all forms of government are bad. It's hard to argue that a small limited government that's respectful of its constituents' rights and focused only on providing certain necessary services is bad. I'm sure that most reasonable people would have no problem giving a small amount of their income to such a government, in order to preserve the society and general public order.
What is bad however, is a morally bankrupt government that does things such as using public money to bail out corrupt banksters, allowing its cronies to privatize gains and socialize losses, waging pointless wars and murdering people across the globe and engaging in all sorts of morally reprehensible and indefensible behavior.
There are lots of smart people on this sub and a lot of them have a very strong moral compass, hence why they are outraged by what's going on and why they hope that Bitcoin can change the current system, or at least steer it in the right direction. The whole "taxation is theft" paradigm is a direct byproduct of people getting sick of being openly robbed, oppressed and treated like dirt by the very people who are supposed to protect their rights and well being.

People may not be inherently evil but they are often perfectly rationally selfish. Suppose a mining company has no bitcoin holdings and that they liquidate their earnings as soon as they get them. In that case, the company is incentivized to try to get as much hashing power as possible, regardless of the fact that they are undermining faith in bitcoin across the board. Sure, the price may drop for a while, but that will be followed by a drop in difficulty and the company won't really see any real losses beyond the initial difficulty readjustment period. This is just one of the possible scenarios.
Almost the entire value behind bitcoin lies in the fact that it is supposed to be a trustless system, where we don't have to trust any one authority/actor to do the right thing. You say that GHash will not destroy the network they are in symbiosis with, but that still doesn't prevent, say, their staff from going crazy/irrational and trying to destroy bitcoin, or the government infiltrating them and attacking bitcoin from the inside. The whole point of bitcoin is that we shouldn't have to trust and have faith that events like that won't happen. The moment we have to do that, we may as well just revert to using the legacy banking system, which is regulated and less likely to destroy your assets than a few shady semi-ethical actors who promise that it'll be ok "because hey, we're not bad guys and you can trust us".
The reality is that the mining incentives are currently completely broken because they encourage centralization and collusion. Something needs to be done about that and the core dev team needs to get to work and stop fucking around and beating their chests on Github in pointless pissing contests.
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:00:08
They wouldn't. nostdal_org has no fucking clue what he's talking about.
That user lost his bitcoins because he used a buggy old version of the Brainwallet.org website (a faulty client if you will) to manually craft a transaction record that didn't specify a change address. Basically, when making a transaction you need to specify two addresses: one destination address and one change address where the remaining coins will be returned. Whatever is not accounted for gets allocated for mining fees. Example: if you have 20 coins, send 1 coin to me and 10 to your change address, the remaining 9 will go to miners. That guy obviously had no idea how the Bitcoin protocol works on a low level and created a transaction that sent all of his change coins to miners. The reason why you normally don't have to worry about this (and why most people don't know about this BTC "feature") is because all decent clients take care of this for you. I guess Satoshi had never assumed that end users would manually mess with this.
If you're using a paper wallet, that doesn't necessarily imply that your coins will be lost when you decide to send them, because what really matters is HOW you send them. Using a proper client such as Multibit or QT, there is no danger of that happening. Even if you're not using a paper wallet and manually craft a TX with no change address, you will lose your coins.
Moral of the story: unless you're a developer AND know how the protocol works, don't fuck with it. Use a true and tried client instead.

I agree. Money in circulation needs to be backed by products, i.e. a certain amount of energy/work that was expended on making those products. In other words, wealth is proportional to the amount of entropy that was reduced by putting in a certain amount of work.
A huge limiting factor in the advancement of our civilization is the fact that we are still burning dead dinosaurs to fuel our demand for energy and yet the amount of currency in circulation reflects that of a society with a lot more disposable energy. If all outstanding debts were settled right now, there would be a massive shortage of goods and a lot of large scale defaults would ensue.
Until we get cheap and renewable energy sources right (e.g. nuclear fusion, solar etc), the global economy can't really scale and printing money backed by nothing will just cause more inflation. History keeps repeating itself because the people in power think they can fight the second law of thermodynamics with guns and printing presses.

I am not morally obligated because I never signed up for those services. If an armed person shows up on your doorstep and says "Give me money so I can build you a road, park and fire department, or else", wouldn't you call it robbery?
All I ask is that these contracts and services be of voluntary nature. If my local fire department went door to door asking for money so they could provide their awesome service, I'd gladly donate. If there was a toll booth on my local road asking me to pay a dollar every time I used it, I'd gladly pay for maintenance and upkeep.
That said, the government usually spends a small portion of our money on the things we really need and the rest goes into various "services" that we never asked for. I don't remember asking my government to send soldiers to Afghanistan to murder people, nor do I remember asking them to hook up their cronies in the construction industry with building thousands of miles of dead end roads and tunnels to nowhere with public money. I am in no way morally obligated to pay for any of that.

Bitcoin isn't the best tool for micro transactions (plus they pollute the block chain). It's great for storing and transferring larger sums of money.

It's nice to see someone in Moy's position speak so positively about bitcoin and the whole aspect of being decoupled from the banking system.

It's good to see there are still some decent and honest people in the government.

I had to downvote you because your argument is completely idiotic. I explained the concept of cryptographic key-pairs to my 55 year old parents the other day and they totally understood everything I was talking about, despite the fact that their computer knowledge is limited to using Firefox and making Skype calls. I even gave my dad a paper wallet with 1 BTC and he perfectly understood how it works and how to redeem it.
Here's another reason why your argument is a ton of crap: in the bitcoin world the equivalent of fixing your car would be writing your own wallet. I actually wrote my own wallet client because I didn't like anything out there, but my folks would likely have all their needs met by a standard client like Multibit or Blockchain.info (for mobile use).
I constantly keep hearing this retarded argument that bitcoin is "too difficult" for people to use. AGAIN, people don't need to understand how ECDSA signatures, integer factorization and Merkle roots work, they just have to understand the high level protocol abstractions. Give people more credit, they aren't stupid and a lot of them are definitely willing to learn. And the more you know, the more power you have and the less power your societal overlords have over you.

Actually the fact that they are irreversible is a huge part of the value proposition behind bitcoin. If some central entity could reverse, withhold, freeze and otherwise mess with transactions, bitcoin wouldn't really be different from the existing solutions (Paypal, Visa, wire transfers etc).
Another thing is that bitcoin is probably not very useful to people who don't trust themselves (or trust other people to take care of their wealth better than they can). Bitcoin requires you to educate yourself and take responsibility for your finances but it also empowers you in ways a centralized system never could.

I totally agree with you, and those things happening would actually destroy bitcoin because almost all of its value proposition is based on decentralization, anonymity and detachment from the current corrupt system. If bitcoin ever becomes centralized and regulated like that, then it becomes useless... why waste all the hashing power when we can just use Paypal or Visa instead.
Luckily I don't see that kind of regulation happening since most mining power is outside the US.

By the sound of it, you don't really know much about bitcoin and you're applying a traditional paradigm to a new thing that simply doesn't exist in the same idea space.
Let me explain. Just because your keys are hosted by a company doesn't mean they can be seized. Look at the blockchain.info wallet: your wallet is encrypted with a key that only you have. Even if you ever lose your wallet, it can be deterministically regenerated from a seed pass phrase you're given during the signup process. They are hosting your wallet but can't really see what's in it.
The cool thing is that the current state of technology and cryptography enables these kinds of self-hosted systems.

It's a free market. If someone wishes to continue using fiat money stored in the central banking system, they're free to do so. People who want more control over their assets will choose bitcoin. I don't know why everyone thinks that there are only two outcomes for bitcoin (failure or complete adoption).
In fact, we wouldn't want to force people to use bitcoin if they don't want to. Let everyone choose whatever suits them the best. The systems can coexist and people will switch back and forth between them as they compete, innovate and try to add value to the end user. Free markets can sort this one out.

If the current tps limit causes the fees to rise, then so be it. I use bitcoin mainly to store larger sums, so even if I have to pay $5-10 when I'm moving my money, that's fine... small price to pay to be outside the fiat ponzi.

Agreed. Generally speaking, if there is an incentive to exploit and abuse something for personal gain, people cannot be trusted to not do that. This is the kind of problem that has to be enforced in code.
Speaking of which, what are the core developers doing to mitigate this problem in the future and make bitcoin resistant to pooling and mass collusion? Not to sound disrespectful, I really admire the work you guys are doing, but I've seen nothing but half hearted explanations from Gavin as to why GHash misbehaving is not "likely" to happen. Sorry but that's simply not good enough. What is being done to fix this problem? Are you guys even talking about this problem and trying to find a solution? A number of solutions (admittedly, some of them half-baked) were proposed by the community and got next to zero feedback from the development team.
Overall, this is all really undermining my faith in Bitcoin. I am not alone in feeling this way.

We paid for our phone line, sewer network and even the road leading to our property. The government took our money multiple times promising to build all those things and ended up delivering exactly nothing. They spent the funds on their private "business trips" and parties. The level of corruption here is through the roof.

Actually it *is* irrational, because you could just buy bitcoins for the same price (or less), without having to take on a massive risk of buying and ordering mining equipment (which you may or may not get, and which may or may not net you any gains).

I agree. I don't think bitcoin should be used for microtransactions. I think of it as a store of value - imagine having a vault full of gold in an alternate dimension that no one can get to.
I REALLY hope that bitcoin NEVER takes off for stupid microtransactions such as buying coffee, tipping and gambling on dice websites. It just bloats the chain when you could just as easily pay with fiat.
I see the real utility of bitcoin in escaping capital controls, thwarting attempts at monetary debasement, evading confiscation of wealth and so on. The real utility is in the freedom. You don't bring a gold bar to Starbucks and ask to pay with it, and yet it somehow doesn't make gold a shitty store of value.

I know that businesses will take everything they can get. The thing is, every transaction has a bidder and an asker. They either have to match somewhere or the transaction will be impossible and won't take place. I simply avoid businesses that refuse to pay what I ask for my services. Free market at work. I don't see what we are arguing about here.
I simply don't understand why some people get so mad when someone won't take their offer. If the other party doesn't think it's fair, then let them walk away. Don't call them spoiled, lazy, roll your eyes or whatever. Here's a short personal anecdote: I once used to work for this medium sized privately owned company that was underpaying me. I was aware of what the market was willing to pay and I asked the CEO for a raise. He immediately shut me down and told me it wasn't an option. I decided not to keep working against my interest, looked into a few other jobs and got a new one that paid about 70% more (not kidding). When I announced my resignation, he got really emotional, said that I don't recognize the value of hard work and told me to leave the premises immediately. I later heard he was asking around about me, calling names etc. So I don't recognize the value of hard work because I'm not willing to work against my financial interests while lining his pockets? Yeah good luck trying to shame people with platitudes.
I've had the same experience with selling stuff online. I was once selling a gaming rig for a certain price (that I thought was fair) and some guy called to ask if I was willing to lower the price. I lowered it a little but not much. He then insulted me, said that my machine is worthless and that I don't know what I'm doing. I was like o_O.
I think that people who can't stomach getting countered probably shouldn't be doing business with anyone.
