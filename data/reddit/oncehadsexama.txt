that seems a bit misleading... If you have 2 BTC spread out among multiple addresses, they don't count you as one person. That website's logic would only work if every person kept all their wealth at one address
@_date: 2014-12-30 03:22:02
The problem is that people will always view it as a fraction of a bitcoin and they'll view Bitcoin itself as expensive. What if it's at $10,000 a coin like Draper thinks will happen? The average person psychologically wants a full bitcoin. Not bits, a bitcoin. This is true for myself too. When I started, I wanted at least one full bitcoin. I didn't know the supply, I didn't want a certain percentage of the network, I wanted a bitcoin. People are going to feel weird paying $1000 of their hard earned money (and to some people a couple weeks salary) for a small fraction of a digital asset. They'll always view bits as a fraction of a bitcoin, not the default unit. That's just human nature.

All I have to say is that if .28 bitcoin is ever worth a lot, I'm going to be an EXTREMELY wealthy man... 
Unlikely though. Unlike a lot of people on this sub, I don't think bitcoin's market cap is going to be like 100 trillion USD with any significant probability. I've never wanted to be more wrong in my life though haha

In this case, the phrase "Jewing" means something along the lines of "acting greedy about money"... So the image is claiming that is excited to get rich more than he is excited to be a part of something big.
Whether or not it's true, it was some nice comic relief

The stock market (and as a side effect current market cap figures) is merely what **marginal** buyers and sellers are willing to pay for something. 
If there is ever a time where people are scrambling for liquidity (see 2008), those marginal prices will come back down to earth. 2008/2009 would have been a significantly steeper decline without the liquidity the bailouts/stimulus provided and the market caps of stocks could have easily gone well below the "market cap" of the USD.

yea, I was mildly bothered by that question, but I just rolled with it. I mean it isn't seen as taboo since it's asked in a more educational and inquisitive forum and bitcoin only makes up a small portion of my net worth, but it still felt odd.

Depends on which people you're talking about. If you're talking about my mom or sex ed teachers, it was better. If you're talking about the average oversexualized hollywood song, probs not.

Yea, that's a more overarching application of game theory.

They don't take 5 days unless you only have a bank transfer set up. Then the **bank** takes 3-5 days to give your money to coinbase.
I sold bitcoin for USD (to my coinbase USD wallet) instantly. That was only because that transfer didn't involve my bank.

Richer than me in bitcoin, not in general
@_date: 2015-01-03 22:22:51
One thing I think no one wants to talk about is why Bitcoin hit $1000 in the first place. It's widely accepted that there was a good amount of price manipulation to get us to the peak last year... Now it's just settling back to where it should be. 
That peak was unsustainable without greater adoption.

I think he's major in the sense that he is on arguably the biggest 24 news network and more well known than the average reporter. He's not Brian Williams, but until Brian decides to do a 45 minute special on his time working with Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2009, I'm fine with calling Morgan major.
If it makes you feel any better, I almost put "major" in quotes as well, but I didn't want to do that twice in the title.
@_date: 2015-02-17 13:45:20
Both sides of the aisle have a tendency to marginalize the other based upon the most idiotic arguments from the opposing camps. I think you would be surprised how objective some people are over there. I'd say 30% of them are some flavor of bitcoin enthusiast who just have a problem with the attitudes of much of (I believe I fit in that category). Then, there are many shades of gray between that and the absolute downright relentless trolls that make people question if they are paid or not.
Most buttcoiners like the technology at the very least, but the community or the currency is an easy target to make jokes about. All that is to say that I don't believe there will be much "conceding" from either side, but a good debate may cause people to change which shade of gray they are or make them have a greater understanding of where the other side is coming from. I'd like to think I can see cases from both sides and they both make good cases - they both have their crazies to an extent and both can have an echo chamber feel at times, but there are smart people who want to engage in real discussion somewhere in the mix.
@_date: 2015-02-17 12:58:19

Thank you for being the only person in the entire subreddit to attempt to explain these to me haha
@_date: 2015-02-17 09:34:47
Look through my comment history (outside comments related to this thread and the linked buttcoin thread. [Here's an example]( Based upon my buttcoin posts alone, some may pigeon hole me as a troll, but in real life, my friends see me as that nerdy guy who probably talks about too much how bitcoin is actually cool.
I know there are legitimate "trolls", but that term is thrown around too generally. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 10:15:04
haha, it kinda felt like a rant and I wanted that paragraph to be the "if you read nothing else of this late night rant, read this part". That whole paragraph probably doesn't need to be bolded, but it the words of Drake, You Only Live Once.... am i right?
@_date: 2015-02-17 14:22:00
 he's the first im aware of to have an entire show dedicated to the education and perspectives surrounding it. I really like that the commercial's main stated objective/tagline is "by the end of this episode, you will understand bitcoin". It sounds like an innocuous goal, but that's actually a big deal considering how little so many people know about bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-17 09:55:17
Yea, although in defense, I feel like they may have felt that I seemed biased because of my post history. I also probably included too much of the regular condescending-type language. 
The circlejerk part on either side of the fence hasn't ever been too appealing to me although I play the part in both when I see an opportunity to be funny. It just so happens that it is easier to be funnier in but [when I see a good opportunity to be funny here, I take it as well](
I guess I just wish this sub was less of an echo chamber and less conspiratorial, but that's some of the crowd bitcoin attracts in the present day. Kinda sad though that in two bitcoin dedicated subs, people aren't too interested in really discussing bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:21:47
I agree about them and although I haven't read their book, I like what they had to say in the interviews I've seen. I had to condense it all into a title that would look good on the front page... I think he's going to be explaining bitcoin in a thorough, entertaining and easy to digest manner while bringing a decent amount of name recognition and avid followers who tend to be more free thinking. That hasn't exactly been done before. Is that better? haha
@_date: 2015-02-17 11:42:47
I'm not here to defend CNN, but as shows on CNN go, Inside Man is high quality IMO. The non newsroom type shows can be ok

@_date: 2015-02-17 09:03:37
Yea, I obviously fall very close to the middle on that spectrum and I was hoping to maybe get input on both sides and see if the non-fringe members of one side legitimately had a more compelling case.
Also, I love your dichotomy of "this is a problem right now, therefor it can never work" vs "it's no problem, sidechains will solve world peace and end all suffering of human kind"... That's so true and eloquently phrased, but just like religion, there are people who are every shade of grey in the middle on the spectrum from "Dear lord baby Jesus, my best friend and savior" to "God absolutely cannot exist and religions are merely cults with a dead creator"
People like you are the reason I want to have this type of discussion; I feel like the majority of bitcoiners and buttcoiners aren't "crazy", it's just the loudest ones who are.
@_date: 2015-02-17 13:52:03
just as an example, check out the responses to the buttcoin thread I linked in the top. There are some people who met my request for a debate with something along the lines of "no fuck you and your bitcoin" but **there are some that even posted links to articles discussing the merits of the blockchain** and by extension, bitcoin. Others (just like a person from did above) agreed that they would enjoy a debate. In the end, my post that was pretty pro bitcoin for a buttcoin post made it to  on the hot list because of the upvotes... It's not **JUST** an anti bitcoin echo chamber.

Some of my favorites from these accounts (they all have the exact same tweets): "the NSA is the worst" "My dog loves to watch me poop...." "I'm confused, so did the Big Bang happen or not?"

I think that's a somewhat fair point, but have you seen any of his show? I think he does a pretty good job.
Supersize me wasn't too bad. If anything, he was very anti-corporation biased which probably isn't a bad thing on a subreddit where many people think they're infiltrated by corporate shills.
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:35:20
What is a good amount to **you**?
it is a non negligible amount of my net worth, yet still enough to warrant having a strong financial interest in bitcoin. If I had to guess, without using numbers and stuff, higher than the median amount of bitcoins owned by regulars here, but definitely lower than the mean (because of many who own triple digits of BTC or more). That provide any help?
@_date: 2015-02-17 13:57:48
the topic has to be right. When I went through to watch it on netflix, I only watched slightly over half of them because the topics didn't seem ultra intriguing on the others, but if he's covering a topic that you're interested in, he usually does it justice far beyond CNN's regular coverage of whatever plane may have crashed in Southeast Asia that month.
