You're a fool if you think the FTSE 100 will ever stop existing and by proxy, your investments in 401k etc. Having everything in Bitcoin is ridiculously stupid. If you don't have a low cost index tracker following the ftse 100, you're an idiot with extremely risky and volatile pension/saving.
You need to read some books.

Listen fuck boy. I have no interest in researching it and wanted the tldr version. I got it. Now go back to crying over your TRX and Nano losses.

Are we talking about pets.com and enron here, or Bitcoin? I am confused as to which sub I am on...
You definitely lose if you sell.
You have the chance to get it back if you hold.

it doesn't guarentee you won't lose; that I agree with, but it does give you the chance to  bounce back. Pulling out and cutting losses gives you a definite loss.
And isn't this crypto thing of ours supposed to be done with cash you can afford to lose? Hence the whole HODL thang?
