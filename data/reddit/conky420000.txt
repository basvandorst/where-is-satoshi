Did you get a reply from them? They haven't replied to my email regarding the theft.

My pass word was 8 character alpha numeric, so not very hard to crack but still would more effort than guessing at hints. It was BTC that I bought a while back to play around with bitcoin, wasnt' really worth anything until a couple weeks ago. 
An AES 256bit hash of the private key is dsiplayed on the acccont page though. So if that's crackable then anyone with a strongcoin account should probably assume that their private key hash is being run through cracking software right now. 
It doesn't matter that that stroncoin have fixed the bug now because the private key hashes were all exposed.

I didn't use a hint.

I'm not sure how to interpret that info why are there three addresses involved?

I did not put a hint for my password. It had to have been cracked.

I bought the BTC to play around with ages ago when they were worth bugger all. I use several different computers and didn't want to set up wallet software on all my devices. I admit I was lazy and couldn't be bothered for what they were worth. I forgot about them until I saw the price go up bigtime. The fucked up thing I was looking for ways to spend them within the BTC marketplace.
