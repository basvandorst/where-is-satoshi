That might actually make sense, but most of the haters seem to think the flaw is economic rather than technical.


Wait, what?  More info?

Ah, I never knew that concept had a name, thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:49:55
Do you have any links to articles about these incidents?
@_date: 2015-05-25 18:42:45
Hm, I guess it's possible, but I feel like there are a lot of things that could go wrong with that strategy.

Out of curiosity, what's your opinion on bitcoin?  You seem to have some strong opinions about the community, what do you think about the concept overall?  For instance, is it something that's needed but inadequate to meet the need, or is it a bad idea to begin with?

Presumably, if the value drops that much, it will be because people have stopped caring about it.
@_date: 2015-05-25 18:36:45
Why didn't this happen in the early days?
@_date: 2015-05-25 19:26:20
I would agree that people are quick to spin every bit of news as "good for bitcoin", but we have to expect multiple standards of success simply because there's more than one thing to succeed at.
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:14:55
Exactly.  People use it for the purposes it was intended for.  What more can you ask for?
Not only has it already succeeded, it's already failed.  Some of the haters were worried that without government oversight, there would be fraud and instability.  There has been.  There almost certainly will continue to be in the future.  So what?
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:46:32
Thanks, some things to think about.


Was it that vulnerable in its early days?


That would be pretty bad, but any digital alternatives to crypto-currency rely on centralization to begin with.

Some fair criticisms.




It's hard to imagine any p2p trustless payment system that isn't used by people who want to operate outside of the law.  How would you even stop them from using it?
@_date: 2015-05-25 18:58:28
That does sound like a reasonable prediction, and to some extent a description of the present.

steamgamesbtc.com is one option.  I've bought from him, before and after he started the site and I was pretty happy with the service.  Sometimes you can ask if you don't see the game you want listed.

What state powers?  For the purposes of this show, she's a private arbitrator.
