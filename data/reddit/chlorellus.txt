Is this the "more complex ideas" of Satoshi? Is this his new project?

How about calling the bitcoin kids, the bitcoin community?

I like those 2 steps mentionned. We should all stop bitching and start working to help/improve p2pool software, servers and documentation.
Once p2pool is dominant, it will be a bigger incentive to join p2pool than any other pool.

I use it as a backup for when the banking system crashes on its own.

Wow this cloud at cost thing is amazing! They should accept bitcoin as payment!!!

It seems that some agree to the "bits" denomination, others don't.
I propose a new incentive for the bitcoin industry. Let's have a "bit" day on a specific date, like a month in advance. All the community members that agree on the bit denomination need to pledge they will spend some of their bits on companies/organizations that use the bit denomination by default on bit day. That will be a major incentive for the industry to switch.
Feel free to propose better ideas.

Very good constructive content. Much appreciated. Thanks!

You are totally right. The more we use them, the more the bitcoin economy will grow. We would not be here today without the 10 000 BTC pizza!

I like your post. I have been a lurker for quite some time and just changed that. I actually put down a post right before I read yours!
Lurkers, rise and post your thoughts!

This is awesome! Where can we find a list of shopify merchants?

What about usine BTC in the exchanges and having a selection between BTC and mBTC in the wallets? That makes bitcoin valuable and makes it easy for day to day transactions with mBTC.

I just emailed whole foods to ask them to sell through gyft. If you would like this too, please do the same and let's burst them with requests!

How about using a namecoin blockchain to store bitcoin addresses based on a pseudonym? The send command would only need the pseudonym!
Ex: send 0.01 CryptoWallets confirm_code
That would make it extremely easy for the sender and the receiver could change his pseudo and/or BTC address anytime!

You're not the Toronto mayor? LOL!

I would use mBTC instead of BTC. It would make more sense to be used in the third world with non-smartphone users
