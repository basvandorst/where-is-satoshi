I believe Blockchain wallet is down right now. My balance is currently showing 0 BTC when I have at least 1 BTC in my public address imported into my wallet.

You need to understand that the ATMs are owned by a company and a purpose of a company is to make money. If you're in Vancouver, I sell for 1.5% fee.

ATMs in Vancouver charged a 7% fee on buy and sell.

There's no proof that ASICs exist yet. I'll see in January.

Agreed, don't complain about the devs when Bitcoin-qt is open-source. Sometimes you need to do shit yourself to get what you want.

cgminer crashes after I go beyond 965/280, I'm using BAMT running on USB. 
Fan running at 45%, 68C and 1.163V with no case. I have the regular Sapphire model.

Interac-E transfer. Bought over 100 Bitcoins over it.

BFL could be bribing them with Bitcoins. LOL

You shouldn't be mining with Windows if you're running it 24/7. I run BAMT on a 4GB USB.

I crapped a couple bricks when I saw this, I sent 10 BTC to them and earned back 2.1% already.
EDIT: I hope they store the BTC in an offline wallet. It also says here that there's going to be an infrastructure upgrade tomorrow!

Folding is also a good alternative but I prefer not having the landlord complain as the power bills probably went up $30 already.

You should overclock your 5870 when mining and you could probably get 330mHash+. I get 310mHash on my 5830 clocked at 950 and memory downclocked at 280.

Is it okay to use blockchain.info to check locked wallet balance?

You can easily tell it's bull if they call it a "Liquid Nitrogen Generator"
