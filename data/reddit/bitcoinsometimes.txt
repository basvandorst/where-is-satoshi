If each tether is backed by USD why can't you exchange tether for fiat? Any why put out a phony audit? Why not perform a legit audit? 
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:10:43
You've earned a parody account!
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:28:00
That's what you idiots were saying a few more than ago when it was 8k. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:29:12
Strong support at ~~8k~~ ~~7k~~ ~~6k~~ 5k

It could, did they just print a bunch of new tether?

Why wait a decade when you can do it now! 
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:33:21
All the growth for the last week came from a sharp pump. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:13:16
That's not how it works. Everyone knows the ancient Chinese custom is to sell your bitcoin for Chinese New Year and buy it back after the June solstice. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:16:40
June solstice is right around the corner. Once that hits it's straight to the moon.  Lambos for everyone.

**Come on Bears!**
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:33:13
Every single major coin pumped 5% simultaneously, even dogecoin. Do you guys think this is behavior of a legit market? Or do you think fake tether money was injected into the system? 
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:59:31
People who understand markets stay away from Bitcoin. This is a market for rookie investors to get fleeced. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:06:08
It will
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:42:04
Yes, feed the whales. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:27:39
None of them really think it can be used as a currency. They just want to get rich quick. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:14:39
And two weeks from now he'll be saying $5500 is bottom, buy now!

**Being Bitcoin all the time was just too much to keep up with, I'm just Bitcoin sometimes now**

omg guys, prepare for moon. Check out this lemonade stand **that accepts** [BITCOIN!!](
@_date: 2018-06-17 21:19:20
Usually around 2am Friday and Saturday
@_date: 2018-06-24 04:58:16
Umm... you have to be a retarded investor to still be holding. The writing has been on the wall for a while now. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 01:03:43
This is good for bitcoin

Q: How do you turn a billion dollars into 500 million?
A: This
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:06:27
Nobody wants to buy Bitcoin anymore. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:03:37
No dude, you don't understand. I have this unique string of characters that nobody else knows. Give me food for it and you in turn can tell somebody else these letters and numbers for bullets.

One pretend pump can't stop the death spiral. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:35:16
Big money got big by making smart investment decisions. Kind of strange that they're not jumping into Bitcoin no? 
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:44:37
Bear market fixed, we did it Reddit! 
@_date: 2018-06-17 16:07:37
Propped up by pretend tether money so the whole thing doesn't collapse

Institutional money is not coming to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:21:46
Totally not worthless. Keep buying the dips, you'll have a Lambo in no time. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:55:55
1. Chinese government temporarily bans crypto
2. Price drops
3. Chinese government scoops up cheap Bitcoin
4. Chinese government profits 
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:21:30
**Last chance to buy Bitcoin above 6k**
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:27:37


They will however take your money from you. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:13:18
Are you advocating for governmental regulation? 
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:18:37
If it starts mooning no one spends it. That logic doesn't work. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:20:29
I guess I was wrong ��

Gold has inherint value. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 21:01:22
There's no demand for Bitcoin anymore. All that's left is hodlers. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:16:24
I don't understand. I thought everyone at the world cup was going to use Bitcoin. Shouldn't it be mooning right now?
@_date: 2018-06-13 03:40:55
If your crypto wet dream plays out like you think it will, the people that cashed out at 18k and scooped up cheap coin after it crashed will be better off than the HODLers

**Let's go Bulls and Bears! Both are vital for a healthy market and we need to acknowledge that!**
@_date: 2018-06-11 03:26:49
Worth billions of what? 
@_date: 2018-06-16 17:14:25
7k never again. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:48:28
They're delusional. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:52:09
**Support the Bears!**
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:30:17
My prediction: a pump followed by another dump. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:39:39
Not meant to be insightful. Countering the claim that hodling is the key to success. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 03:38:45
This. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:40:07
Buy the tasty tasty dips and HODL!!!!
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:35:48
Who writes this stuff? The price of Bitcoin has been stable. So naturally this means it's going to go up, or down, a whole bunch. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:40:36
Who has more money, Warren buffet or you smart bois? 
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:50:32
So... Hold on for dear life, unless the price is going down then sell. Got it. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:48:17
Remains to be seen. As of now it's not. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:31:25
Because a non accounting firm did and audit that wasn't really an audit and expressly stated that it didn't really mean anything. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 19:57:09
**Yes I am**
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:24:27
Hahahah funniest comment of the day.
