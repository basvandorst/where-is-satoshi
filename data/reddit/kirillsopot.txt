I was thinking that it’ll happen after the new year. But I didn’t take into account the 3-day before holidays notion into consideration.

I’ve started to collect crypto simply cause it might be the only form of payment in the near future. The progress never stops. Who says that the monetary exchange system we have in place today is exactly the one we will be using even 10 years from now?

I love how people are holding together and always suggesting each other to be careful about their investment. It really paints a good picture of a caring community

It is interesting to see how many new people are actually fall under our mental image of weak hands. 
I imagine there is an increasing number of young recruits who are actually digging deeper and trying to see beyond the numbers

Let me explain. I'm pro-Bitcoin and it's sad for me to see that the Bitcoin ATMs are rising from associations with the Liquor stores... In the end we're talking about branding and positioning. 
Yet... and here is the opposite thought that you made me think about with your response. Maybe we don't need all that hype about the Bitcoin? But then again it's price will dramatically fall...
What do you think?

Could it be someone's evil master plan to show how shitty the Bitcoin is? It needs to be placed only next to the Liquor stores, so the parents would warn their kids of using crypto instead of educating them?...

much like the western union is always at the forgotten corner store that you never notice. What kind of magic is going behind those invisible places right under your nose?

I'm sorry but I'll have to disagree with the statement that the teleportation has to do anything with any speed. It's instant; no time delay in traveling.

Or trying to reach distant galaxies at the speed of light while the Universe keeps expanding making the Galaxies literally run away from your space-traveling vessel.

see, from this picture it is very unclear if this Liquor store is: 
1. accepting Bitcoins? 
2. has a BTM? 
3. Supports the Bitcoin Hype and placed a Bitcoin sticker on their glass. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:38:14
I begin to think that people who are behind BTMs are exploiting the system just any scammer is exploiting the hype over the smart contracts and ICOs. 
What if the BTMs are done by the real people that want to do good for the community. I was thinking the other day about starting one but it wouldn't certainly be at the Liquor Store and it wouldn't aim to rip you off...
Why cut the hands of the customers who simply wanna use your services. 
I don't get it...
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:39:43
1. Anyone know of the map of the BTMs in LA? 
2. Do you guys know if it's one company or independent entrepreneurs running them?

Alright, that sounds reasonable.  
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:15:11
could you please elaborate:
1) what is a bitcoin island?
2) how will bitcoin end up on a moon if currently there are no major projects going on regarding the colonization of the moon? Are you talking about blockchain somehow being used in the science robotics?  Just don't see why would they require Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:24:26
How about storing lambos on the blockchain? 
We can issue the digital certificates for them even before they are produced. Those certificates could be self-executing contracts...
So once you need a new lambo you'd just need a click and the lambo will go into production. 
So on blockchain, you'll still be a king in possession of all of those lambos that you can cash in any time, but you wouldn't need a lambo island. How would you use an island full of lambos anyway...
PS: And why would you need that many lambos anyway. You can show power otherwise

Alright, so I first bought about 0.1 bitcoin when it was around &lt;$2K/1BTC, we all have seen the $6K milestone reached just recently. Just curious now what do you think guys? It might sound like a dumb question but does it still make sense to buy BTC when it's rising so fast? I kinda wanna just keep buying it, but then I know that it might not be its final price as its all going up and down lately. Idk, what you think?

See, I think that the future of space exploration is in the teleportation. Otherwise, we're really stuck... 
But then again we're really only at the beginning of the space exploration era and free internet will boost it dramatically. 
Now a good question is can we open-source the space-traveling programs like Space X? Are we able to imagine collaborative projects where people and AI are working towards the smart colonization of space as a community?
