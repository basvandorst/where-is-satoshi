The Lighting Network might help with the Bitcoin price. Am I right?

Awesome :D

Thank you for pointing out the inconsistency in years! I changed it from 4 to 5 yesterday to offer more value to the advertisers. The site will not go offline. I would do anything to make the customer happy since this project is tied to a larger project.
I accept crypto. (you have to go to '' read the rules and either click on ''Click here to start ordering your pixels! '' which will allow you to use the Coinpayments payment method (accepts up to 30+ cryptocurrencies) or you can contact me directly. 
The point is to make  a website where you can discover new crypto and/or blockchain related products, service, and media channels. 
If you are an advertiser you will get increased traffic to your website and a strong SEO link.

Better play with real $100 dollars. Doing this with fake money won't ever be the same as doing it with real. You need to learn the real deal.
