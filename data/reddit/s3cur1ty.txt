I think one problem with it is his $400,000,000 in BTC he's supposed to have. If we ever find out who Satoshi really is, the US government will rip into him. We need to prevent that.

It'd be great if it wasn't using the shitty symbol.

Those girls are healthy, not "so skinny." Just because you like bigger girls does not mean these girls are unhealthy.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:07:48
Oh whoops read it wrong
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:50:35
Different currencies have different exchange rates. One btc may be $8000 USD but 10000 Zimbabwean dollars. It's equal to the same amount, still.

He got away with it this time....
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:00:37
Yes I'm verified, no It's not my first purchase. In total I've bought 1.6 btc from coinbase, not a lot.. But it's all I've been able to afford. That 193.12 was all my spending money
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:34:18
Dang! $16.. Heck of a tip
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:03:21
Definitely. Not selling till it hits 10K (;
Unless of course I see a very good chance of making a profit from selling and re-buying.
@_date: 2013-10-25 08:19:49
I didn't even think about that when I installed Electrum. Why doesn't it need to download data like Bitcoin-qt does?
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:07:03
What if I want it to sell the second it drops to a certain number?
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:10:34
How though? Just set the sell price lower than the current price? Or would that just sell immediately  and I would get gypped?
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:03:44
I know ;-;. I said If, not when.

I wrote a python program to get [this file]( every 15 minutes and output the relevant data (in this case, the price of mtgoxUSD) from it to a text file, which is read by LCD Smartie and output to the screen.
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:54:12
Pre-Loaded card sounds fantastic! It would definitely give more people the ability to buy Bitcoin, and another reason to choose you.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:11:09
Oh, dude. You're awesome! &lt;3
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:40:32
Did you REALLY sell?
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:16:18
Nope. 18. Bought bitcoins as soon as I could after my birthday.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:14:09
Well I was just using mtgox for practice. To see if I could get it to work. I haven't been home since I posted this thread, but I think bitstamps price is in that json file too
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:05:57
Doubtful. My first purchase was .25 BTC
@_date: 2013-10-23 18:50:13
I heard someone say yesterday that websites can see your extensions, thus it makes you a bigger target for someone to steal your bitcoins. Be careful, friend.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:58:13
Well MAYBE that's how to get shit done. MAYBE if people see just how many fuck ups are in the algorithm, it would persuade Coinbase to fix it.
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:38:39
Good luck! I take it you probably won't let people purchase via credit card?
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:53:33
I know. I have bills, sadly.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:53:20
This is extremely unacceptable. I love Coinbase, and I love Bitcoin. I bought .35 Bitcoin on Sunday when 1 BTC was $551.77, which was set to be in my account last night(Friday) at 11:50 PM. I work nights, so I get off work, come home and see an email stating that they canceled my order **an hour and a half after** they were supposed to fund it. That's bullshit. That was literally all I can afford. Now If I try to buy it again I'll be down .12 BTC. I am not a happy customer.
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:12:30
I bought bitcoin right before the whole thing went down where they ran out and had the notice up saying they would get whatever amount the price was "on Friday"
I doubt you will lose it, but i guess just message Coinbase support when you do. I just did, we'll see what happens.
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:59:16
Be pessimistic all you want, if not Bitcoin, then some other ecurrency will.
@_date: 2013-10-25 04:39:36
Why though? Am I supposed to delete the wallet information from my computer after I back it up? If not, what does it matter if I back it up on an offline computer?
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:58:33
Actually I don't have a Pi. Ive been wanting to get one, but with this I just used LCD Smartie and hooked it up to my computer
@_date: 2013-10-24 07:00:07
Fuck I'll buy em for $130 a piece!
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:52:11
I got the email for a canceled order a while back an HOUR after I was supposed to get the coins.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:18:12
The latter. If I knew how to do that, I might do so, but I've only barely just begun with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:47:18
The only software I'm using is [LCD Smartie](
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:19:28
Or he could just want to bank in on the growth.
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:46:35
I'm especially in this if the price crashes below $100 again.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:30:23
Eventually there will be a much more reliable method, and succeeding won't be much of a big deal. No matter what, he will just have to rely on the goodness of other people. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:50:17
This gets the current price of Bitcoin every 15 minutes and displays it on this screen, along with the price of all of my Bitcoins (I only have 1 right now.)
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:47:53
It's probably a scam, but I know nothing about it.
@_date: 2013-10-24 07:11:25
Looks like spam. Brand new account, Horribly formatted text, and claiming to give out $4000 and $7000 for free. Don't click, just report.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:07:19
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:31:14
If I could buy more I would. A bitcoin is twice what I have in the bank. lmao
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:56:48
Christ. Why can't I get tipped $90?! That guy is awesome.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:14:32
Alas, no. I ordered this from ebay
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:06:49
Just a question for future reference. I don't plan on selling at all right now. Nor do I have enough money to buy because I'm a broke teenager.
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:10:19
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:58:23
I don't own a credit card.
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:23:05
Yeup!(: I'm probably even going to make something pop up on my computer screen if a giant change takes place. Say suddenly jumping up $40 or if the price crashes.
@_date: 2013-10-24 07:06:40
"Realistic" is not "Well, the giant online black market is dead so bitcoin must be. Let's ignore all the businesses that have started accepting it and the smaller OBM's trying to take Silk Road's place"
And like Jratcliff said, Feel free to sell your bitcoins if you're so sure it's dead.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:32:26
Damn. I never get tipped. Even by accident :C
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:45:33
I hope it crashes to &lt; $20, honestly. But that's probably not gonna happen. *sigh* If only..
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:52:33
Not exactly. On top of the fact that quite a few legit businesses now accept bitcoin as payment. Many many more online black markets are popping up to take Silk Road's place. Believe what you want but Bitcoin is only just getting started.
