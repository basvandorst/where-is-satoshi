Well, maybe because that is exactly what it was designed to do.  Be a peer to peer electronic currency...
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:35:06
Woohoo!  Bigger blocks are better!  Sooo...raise the block size!

Bitcoin: A peer to peer electronic cash system.
Also, hashtags serve no purpose on reddit AFAIK.  Hash tagging words at the end make absolutely no sense.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:45:51
Cool, thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:15:37
How is it even a debate at this point that bitcoin cash is closer to the original version of bitcoin?  It is so painfully obvious yet so many people think otherwise.  It's simply astonishing...  
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:15:40
You should write some price prediction articles like everyone else.   “Why bitcoin could hit 50k by December”.  Body of article - Could go up, could go down, might stay flat.  Thanks for reading my horrible piece, plz be sure to hit like/subscribe.

Wow!  I’m assuming you weren’t around a few years ago when bitcoin had extremely low fees, fast transactions and was a store of value.  But nah, let’s “adapt” into just a store of value.  Unbelievable...
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:41:20
Sooooo... Holidays, difficulty adjustments, and a different coin being up in price equate to attacks now too?  Shitpost - check!
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:12:39
Yep, and as long as high fees and slow transactions continue users will flock to it and other coins.  People can bad mouth alts all they want but it won't do any good.  The rise of alts continue until bitcoin is fixed and it seems unlikely to happen any time soon.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:15:46
Network is clogged and fees are insanely high.  People are switching to coins that work.  Almost every alt is up and bitcoin is down.  Not that hard to figure out.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:12:00
Actually it’s bitcoin, plus one feature vs core
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:18:02
No- bitcoin cash followed the original vision of bitcoin.  A large group of people disagreed with the path bitcoin was on and decided to take action.  This is exactly how bitcoin was designed to work, decentralized.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:36:07
The only answer you will get here is that "Lighting will fix everything".  It's been the popular answer to high fees and network congestion for a long time.  Sadly, users are moving to other cheaper and faster coins because the devs refuse to raise the blocksize.  
If people were to recommend using alt coins even a year ago they would have been laughed out of the sub.  Now is common practice.  Very sad...  
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:05:10
Actually, the blocksize has been discussed for years.  It has been well known for a long time that this was going to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:34:32
How many users do you think there are that are completely fed up with the clogged network and insanely high fees?  There are posts about it popping up on both subs constantly.  You're right, large group is an understatement.  There have been numerous technical arguments why block size increases are fine.  Hell, multiple core devs and mods used to be pro block size increase years ago.  This attack bs is so played...bitcoin is open source for a reason.  So people that disagree on development can do exactly what the bitcoin cash people did.  Attack my ass...  
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:52:33
Very small fee of $5????

If it’s pointless why do people spend so much time and energy bashing it?  
@_date: 2018-08-18 00:06:07
Is this supposed to mean Dodge is 10x faster than Bch and has more capacity?  If so, you realise that applies to btc as well and even more so? What is the purpose of this horrendous post? 
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:07:02
Sheer delusion.  What would lead you to believe this nonsense?  People never cease to amaze me.  
@_date: 2018-08-18 00:26:54
Quite the assumption there pal
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:53:59
Lol!  Thank you for the laugh, well done.  
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:26:31
FUD at its finest 
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:16:04
Why did you explain such a simple concept three times?  In other words, one more than two (or one less than four).  
@_date: 2018-10-09 19:53:51
@_date: 2018-10-10 01:44:06
I don't accept shitcoins because they are not decentralized and no one uses them.  Menger's Regression Theorem applies to gold, wonderful.  Bitcoin is not gold. 
Are you seriously trying to argue that bitcoin's growth isn't attributed to the very title of the paper describing it.  Wow!  A network that grew from nothing and had almost zero value grew because it stored value????????  Do you understand how incredibly stupid that sounds?  No reason even discussing when people spout nonsense like that...
 
@_date: 2018-10-09 14:59:52
Incredible to see the horrific transformation over the last few years.  If this was posted in this sub in 2014 it would been ridiculed and down voted to oblivion.  
@_date: 2018-10-09 19:49:15
No, I don't. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 20:03:28
If wise is recommending using traditional financial institutions instead of btc for the reason it was created then okay, fair enough.  "Bitcoin:  A peer-to-peer electronic cash system" vs "Bitcoin: an unnecessary debt settlement system".  Complete nonsense.  
@_date: 2018-10-10 00:44:58
Bitcoin can become a store of value if it is a successful peer to peer cash system first, not the other way around.  You can't just magically deem something a store of value because it's finite if it has zero utility.  Current holders didn't buy bitcoin because it's a store of value, they bought it because it has utility for them today or speculating that it will in the future. 
I'm taken back by how many people repeat this ridiculous idea that the mainstream will buy bitcoin because it's a store of value when the majority don't know the first thing about it.  It's crazy talk to think that Joe Random will decide to put his hard earned savings into this highly volatile asset because someone said it's a great store of value.  
Bitcoin exploded because of it's utility as a peer to peer, decentralized cash system, without that there is no way for bitcoin to become a store of value.

I wonder (no I don’t) if someone like Ross Ulbricht was a big blocker if he would get hung like Ver on this sub.  
Cool post until I saw the Ver slander.  Continue on with the group think hoard mentality though.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:11:11
You understand the concept of my argument very well.  You just need to resort to being a grammar nazi to save face.  Not surprised in the slightest, you seem like the type.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:17:02
Oh how bitcoin has changed.  People bragging about a $2 fee, unbelievable.  
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:04:42
Sure, just doesn’t make any sense to include that.  Also, it’s laughably ironic considering the rest of the content.
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:22:42
Betcoin also has a BBJ rake.
When you click on the info tab for the BBJ the webpage is not available.  I contacted support and they said we do not have any information on the BBJ.  Leads me to believe they are taking extra rake and pocketing it.  
This was a few weeks ago so please correct me if i'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-07-15 02:27:33
You sound exactly like the typical clueless random shitting on bitcoin.  So quick to point out crashes in hindsight but don't have any sort of important perspective.  
Bitcoin's price, roughly 1 year ago - $2500.  Bitcoin's price roughly 2 years ago - $675.  Bitcoin's price 3 years ago - $250.  I don't think i need to extrapolate.  
Bitcoin is doing VERY poorly????  
Cringe worthy...
@_date: 2018-07-15 04:03:58
Ok, it’s clear that I’m dealing with a very dense individual.  I will spell it out for you. 
“No matter how you look at it” -  this is the way I’m looking at it.  The last 3 years the price has increased ~ 300%/400%/300%.  
Show me one intelligent investor that would describe this as performing very badly. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 03:27:47
This sentiment is absolute nonsense.  Bitcoin will not succeed, let alone “moon” if it can not be used as a digital currency.  Low fees, fast transactions, trust less censorship resistant money is what is was created to be and has got it this far.  Store of value will follow only if it retains the former. 
Gold has become a store of value because it has had utility for countless different things as long as history has been recorded.  Not because people chose a random finite rock to value. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 03:48:28
You can use stats from a timeline you specified that fit your narrative all you want. 
Bitcoin is volatile.  It’s followed  this pattern several times and each time someone just like yourself was saying the same thing you are.  Choosing to focus on the short term crash but neglecting the fact that year after year it continues to show huge growth. 
How in the world is this performing very bad? 
@_date: 2018-07-02 04:08:02
But according to you (and the small block crowd), bitcoin cash is not the real bitcoin.  Since you are the one debating and presumably saying bitcoin cash is an alt coin then it opened at $200.  You can't have your cake and eat it too :).
@_date: 2018-07-01 19:03:51
The white paper makes no mention of a long-term store of value.  If bitcoin does a bad job at being value transfer then it will not be a long-term store of value.  
How is op's comment in any way bullshit?
@_date: 2018-07-15 05:06:15
Fair enough.  Take a peek back at this thread in a year or two and see how it ages.  
@_date: 2018-07-02 04:29:16
I appreciate both sides of the debate.  But, there you go with the name calling the moment you are proved wrong.  Fact  of the matter is, it has performed better than bitcoin has since it's inception despite your attempt at saying it's lost half of it's value a few posts up.
@_date: 2018-07-15 04:45:39
Nope, actually it’s up 300% since last years price in July.  That is a spectacular increase.
You keep using the phrase turning around for some reason and I don’t know why.  I’ll repeat it in case you are confused.  It’s UP 300% since last year.  There is no need for “ turning around” in the sense that you are using the phrase.  
Bitcoin is doing just fine, in fact is doing far and away better than that. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 19:10:34
Ok, I see what you're saying now.
@_date: 2018-07-19 17:17:06
Lol, a man that has done more for crypto in the last month than you would do in a hundred life times.  
@_date: 2018-07-02 03:48:17
This is a standard small block point of view, fair enough.  I don't want to get into that debate.  
It is incredible that you use "screwing up bitcoin" when referencing a block size increase when it was originally intended that way by Satoshi.  Big blockers are not trying to kill bitcoin, they are trying to save it, regardless of your point of view.  
Last, bitcoin cash's price opened around $200.  It has more than tripled since inception.
@_date: 2018-07-02 01:05:46
This is naive to say the least.  Bitcoin can be a store of value if, and only if, it is successful in being an online currency.  If it fails at the latter, another coin will take it's place while functioning much better as a store of value because it has the utility of money.  You seriously can't think that a ten year old technology will be bought simply to store money and nothing else?
Comparing it to gold is (if bitcoin has no or little utility as money) is ridiculous.  Gold has been in demand and used for a variety of things for as long as history has been documented for.  
It needs to succeed at being an online payment system first or their will be no store of value use case.   
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:59:29
Won't every twitch streamer and every donating spectator need to run a lighting node for this to happen?
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:48:23
He doesn’t need to come out and say it.  Anyone who has been around long enough already knows it much more aligned with the white paper than btc.
