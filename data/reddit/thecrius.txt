This is exactly what happened to me (and lots of others I imagine).
It's sad to read about a suicide but I honestly find unfair how OP keep pointing everything out to bitcoins instead of focusing on what went so wrong that his brother hadn't anyone to talk to.

Italy is good for once! We don't care about both those things!

The WiFi is nearly always off because my entire apartment is cabled for ethernet. Btw my wireless has a password composed of alphanumeric and symbol characters. 
Plus, the administration panel is under another password created with the same rules.
I was wondering if there was a remote control for the router but i see that the D-Link implemented it onlly in v.1.16 of the firmware and i was having 1.15 till one hour ago.
Honestly i don't know what to think about it.
My passwords are even stored into a Keepass 2.0 archive, neither in the browser passwords stash.
Malwerbytes did not detect anything. If it's a malware it's deserve control over my notebook at this point I suppose :)
As pointed out by some users i should check deeper in my wife's PC because she's not at all a tech-savy person and could have got a malware of some sort.
I was excluding this because the complaint comes from her about having problem when **I** was connected. Silly married man logic.

I don't know a single one of that software but hey, you sound really badass.
Jokes aside, i'll give them a try, thank you.

Thank you for the explanation, really.
Actually the only things that i cannot explain is how that IP was setup as main DNS in my router control panel.
I've setup it back to google dns. I'll keep an eye on it for a while.
And perform a deep scan with every cleaning software on my wife's notebook.
That's all i can do for the moment.

Thank you for the suggestion.
Going to check there too if i can't fix the problem with some suggestion I got from here.
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:38:35
Well, that is a good question but i don't know why the IP 164.99.248.162 match the hosting called 164-99-248-162-static.reverse.queryfoundry.net.

I don't know nothing about bitcoin and how it works. I'm here to ask for help because i've other interests and do not want invest time in learning about how bitcoin mining works.
Now if you've some useful advice, please. Otherwise thanks you for your contibution :)
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:03:46
I'm going to follow your suggestion asap.
Just some fast/already done response:
1. Firmare atm 1.15. Last firmware 1.16. I'll update it asap.
2. I've run a deep scan on my PC. Plus i've done a deep scan with Malwerbytes and Spybot just to be sure. I'll check my wife's PC at the first moment when she've to do something else :P (Listen to me: DO.NOT.MARRY.A.GAMER.GIRL)
3. I've tried this some days ago but from my own pc just to check if she was lagging and not me. The result was that i had nearly not packet loss (over 3000 packet, 26 loss). I'll try from her PC at the first occasion.
4. Never run it. I've several friends who was involved in bitcoin affairs since the beginning but i've never trusted it. My bad :(
5. My ISP is in my netscan results: *tiscali.it*
6. I've found it as a registered node into getaddr.bitnodes.io. [This is the query result]( Dunno what i can do with this information anyway.
Updated the post. [Here]( some new results. This test has been done with only my notebook connected and nothing open except my browser.
Still, thank you for your advices :)

I've already crossposted to giving the link to this post to not duplicate the post.
Dunno if someone comes here from there.
Actually my wife hadn't latency problem anymore but i still have to find a moment to perform a complete scan of her system.
My system has been scanned several time now with:
- Windows 8 builtin AV
- Avast
- Avira
None of them found nothing. Btw i was just having the builtin AV till now and enough common sense to not download suspicious stuff.
I'll update the main post after havin some time for the scan of my wife's notebook and/or if something comes up. I'll tag you as "interested" (thanks RES) and post an answer to update you if you will be still interested about the situation.

I've updated the post, this is the update text:




I've no idea of how someone has reach the admin panel of my router and changed the main DNS but setting it back to the Google DNS (8.8.8.8) provides the same warning but for a Google DNS server (i suppose as it should be).
The router has been bought way before this last ISP and i've set it to the google DNS from the first days. I really can't imagine how the DNS settings has been changed because i'm the only tech-savy person in this house. :|

I've updated the post. Copying the update text:


I've no idea of how someone has reach the admin panel of my router and changed the main DNS but setting it back to the Google DNS (8.8.8.8) provides the same warning but for a Google DNS server (i suppose as it should be).
[Those]( are the new results. I'm still looking into my wife's PC now and update here if i find something useful.
BTW the moment i've noticed this anomaly, the lag spikes wasn't not anymore a "main problem" to me. I'd just like to understand what was going on down there.

That's not a bad advice but *Time* is a limited resource and i've tons of other things to learn that have some use to me or just interest that amuse me more than learn how bitcoin nodes works :)
As last resort i can straight format my notebook but if it's not needed i'll gladly avoid it.
I'm just asking, if nothing useful comes up probably i'll try to understand what's happening by myself anyway. But if this takes too much time i'll just go for the *format c:*
Thanks anyway for your comment :)
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:09:43
That's some solid advice.
I'm not running a mail daemon nor a dns server, anyway while going for the test my wife could be playing.
I'll try the test again later. to be honest i didn't expect the website to perform such a deep scan and analysis so i didn't thought about having the entire network completely in idle. My bad.
I'm a developer too and absolutely not a security expert but i greatly appreciate your willingness to help and your guesses.
I'm going to block port 24 and 465 btw, just to be sure.
Thanks again for your suggestions.

I am italian too. Not a student. Have a steady job that pays well and had to try 3 bank before being able to open a bank account. London here, dunno about you.
Also, to access my online banking (that is just a fucking list of transaction) I need a fucking calculator-like thing and pass my card in it. Also to remember 3 different passphrase and a password. I just gave up trying to use the online banking because I always get one of the fucking passphrase wrong.
I work in IT. This is a solution thought by someone who know jack shit of technology and security.
I hope banks dies in a fire as soon as possible.
Also don't make me started on the fact that any kind of mortgage or credit card requires you to have a credit score in the country you're in DESPITE the credit card authority being an internation organization so my fucking credit score accumulated in italy should be valid every-fucking-where.
I could buy a house but instead I'm renting (aka wasting money) because I need to build a credit history before being allowed a mortgage.

How I regret not betting those 200€ in an extra graphic card to mine bitcoins years ago, now.
