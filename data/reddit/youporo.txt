if you guys want a safer route, try bitpetite. you get your money back faster than bitconnect / regalcoin. i've made 4.4 ether back after investing 3 ether. 
proof: 
its not that risky since they only hold ur money for 6 weeks whereas bitconnect holds it for longer than 4 months. try out bitpetite and see how it goes. you can put in as little as $10.
