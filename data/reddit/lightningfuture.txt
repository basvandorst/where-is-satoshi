4MB is not easy to do right. It is also very short sighted. We have Segwit now. which is already a capacity increase. Further effort needs to be on the LN.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:39:13
It wont matter when LN comes. Just hang in there.

You sound like one of Rogers shills. Go back to your sub.

They have first mover advantage. they Service a high % of new people entering the space.  
You have them actively pumping alt-coins.
They are also intentionally not implementing Segwit. The QTY of transactions they handle is extremely large. They are literally pooping into the mempool.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:33:55
Go back to your other sub, you shill.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:23:50
Use Segwit right now. Stop trolling.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:02:13
We would be a lot higher if there was not many people actively attacking.
If we had a real free market it would be different story

Use a Segwit wallet next time.
If you are using a shity exchange like coinbase. switch to another one that does support Segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:47:42
Don't know what you are talking about. They Probably just didn't integrate Segwit on their side.

Just Roger Ver dumping again. Things will work out when this blows over. I'm using this time to buy during this sale.

This is Bcash attacking the Mempool with their spam. It causes the fees to go up. This is why people need to start using SegWit right now.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:12:21
Assuming you are not a bcash troll.
Your fee is way too low. You should use a Segwit wallet next time. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:21:11
Just RBF to an address in your control. Or wait 14 days and it will get dropped from the mempool
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:16:58
Why would you try to spend a store of value on an item?
Doesn't sound like a smart thing to do.
I smell bcash FUD.
Go back to your other sub and your bitcoin Jesus.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:25:14
its up to each node/miner to decide. 14 days is the usual.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:47:53
Either your from the other sub spreading FUD or you don't know how to use segwit yet.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:37:39
Here we come!
