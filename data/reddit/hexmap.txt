Since the blockchain solution starts with a time-server (you need a clock and timestamp to organize events) I would add "NTP".... wikipedia-&gt; NTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a few **milliseconds** of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It uses the intersection algorithm, a modified version of Marzullo's algorithm, to select accurate time servers and is designed to mitigate the effects of variable network latency.

I do support decentralized topology for exchanges. But few are really full DEX. We need to find a way to reward developers and people who run nodes ...
The four core functions of any exchange are capital deposits, order books, order matching, and asset exchange. In order to create a fully decentralized exchange (DEX), each of these functions must be decentralized. In most exchanges, only the asset exchange is decentralized, as the assets are cryptocurrencies deployed on the blockchain that no central entity controls. However, the other three functions, and especially capital deposits, are usually centralized. Due to KYC (know your customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations, exchanges are often required to seek users’ identities for capital deposits, creating centralized record-collection and data-storage of personal information.

The economics reminds the total cost of ownership - TCO for cloud computing. In the semiconductor Industry companies like IBM, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. have access to better prices on computing machinery because when they sign a contract to buy they buy a lot ...  I guess in economics is the old mechanism of the difference between the wholesale and retail price...

true, inflation incentive people to expend instead hoarding (hoarDLers) also that's the safety mechanism on how they pay dividends to shareholders. To illustrate what I am talking about, go to google or yahoo finance and **compare** the following stock market tickers Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) or FIRST BITCOIN CAPITAL ORD (BITCF) **to** another ticker that have a lot of workers working for peanuts (minimum wage) such as Mcdonald's Corp (MCD) and check out the chart ;-)

Thanks WP, I really need to buy bitcoin cheap ;-)
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:13:03
sell verb
gerund or present participle: **selling
1. give or hand over (something) in exchange for money.**
Since Bitcoin is not regulated you cannot say that bitcoin is money. Therefore the kid was not selling lemonade.

I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time.  Still wrong.  w/e.  GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY.  It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.
so i've had some whiskey
actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky
