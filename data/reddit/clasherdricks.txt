Ya, the YouTube ads are so cheesy it makes me cringe watching those first 5 seconds. I'm glad for this too.

Yes, thank you. I'm kind of mad this didn't really happen.

That was somehow cringe-worthy and enjoyable.

Exactly! What people don't get about Doge is that even if the perceived market price is dropping.... 1 Doge is always worth 1 Doge.

We don't. It's decentralized. We trust that no one person or entity has control over it.

I would just not buy it from Amazon and not have to worry.
Of course it could be tampered with.

You know there's been a few people who've seen that and thought "hmmm, so that's what Bitcoins are..."

I thought the exact same thing. Even the words on the shirt are accurate to Bitcoin and not just random garbage that thought would sell.

I started this comment as "I don't entirely get how you don't lose money if you sell your BTC for a loss" thinking the current price mattered and assuming it would screw up your hodl too because of rebuying at a different price.
As I typed my question, it became clear what the answer was and I've modified this comment to hopefully help others.
My big confusion is (was): If I bought at 8.5k and now I sell for stuff online at 6.5k I'm taking a loss. I didn't buy to take a loss, so I hodl. (This is how it felt and how I thought) 
If I use that 6.5k Bitcoin to buy something, say an expensive domain name. Then I go buy BTC at 6.5k, it is the same thing as if I spent 6.5k in cash.
At the end of the day I have my 6.5k domain name and I still have my 6.5k worth of Bitcoin and I spent 6.5k in cash (plus minor fees) just like I would've if I bought with cash instead of BTC.
So minor fees (idk how much, could someone give me an estimate for this example?) is basically the cost of us all getting our Lambos.
