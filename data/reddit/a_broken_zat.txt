I was under the impression that Coinbase can store you BC for you, and I (or OP for that matter) can just leave it with Coinbase?? This is not true?
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:53:53
Aint nobody got money for that!

Just a pointer, Coinbase goes through Bitstamp (or at least it did last fall when I came on board.) Can anyone else confirm this?
I mention it because you can watch Bitstamp for better (read accurate) future (in seconds usually) prices of Coinbase. What else is weird is that CB is usually at least $5 above BS, and when the MTG crisis happened the other week, CB was almost $40 higher.

Which ones?

Fuck it, we'll do it live!

About freaking time we peaked the $450 wall

None shall pass!

Think of it like the 1930's era depression. Banks just shut down. People lost all of their savings from the closed bank. Im pretty sure that if MTG is finished, your money is gone.
 Like some of what the other people are saying, Its not regulated nor has any FDIC like policies/institutions in place. Sorry man.

~Edit--yup, just now noticed OPs spelling error as I reading down through the thread. Welp, bring on the downvotes. I was just trying to be funny.

More or less. I sort of almost see it as a sort of long term investment. I predict that Bitcoin will become a much much bigger thing in the next 1 to 5 years, or even 10 years down the road from now.

Whoa, Subway now has Wifi!!!

"reputable security company"
Right. They're probably all being paid to keep their mouths shut.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:21:57
Actually BC hasnt been above $800 in the last two days...jus' sayin'.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:24:20
I cant, but thats what spell check is for. :)
@_date: 2013-10-31 14:03:04
Thats a cool idea. How does it support the minors? I thought there was no fee to send between wallets?
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:23:41
What if you could just use a 3D Printer and print out your sub?
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:28:45
Hey, if anyone is tired of BC and wants out, give them to me! :)
@_date: 2013-10-31 13:59:25
Hey, a fresh college grad can hope, right?
@_date: 2013-10-31 20:31:27
Thats some sound advice. And hence, the $60 worth, and not $6,000 or some other ridiculous amount.
@_date: 2013-10-31 14:01:54
Are these free apps by chance?
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:38:33
I kind of want that to happen, so I can buy really low and jump aboard the gravy train!
@_date: 2013-10-31 13:59:50
Makes sense
@_date: 2013-10-31 13:45:23
Yea, Android. Cool, Ill check it out. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:28:13
No, THIS IS SPARTAAAA!
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:22:47
Whoa, hold your horses man. Lets confirm this before we all go parading around Subway. Mmkay?
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:21:22
Seems Legit
@_date: 2013-10-31 14:01:01
Well spoken reply. I appreciate that, and a good point.
