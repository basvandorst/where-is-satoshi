This is a good video to share with curious people. It keeps it non-technical while explaining  the actual principle by which it works  And it’s short

Well..my point was that their security enhancements are what were important, as opposed to simply figuring out how to do 12 second blocks
I refer to buterin's comment:

Could you say that a cryptocurrency "solution" is not yet a solution while it has security problems? Security being part of the point of it?

It makes sense as long as you overcome the fact that governments usually control permission to broadcast radio. If it's a problem, then relying on a blockchain radio broadcasts would be a centralisation of power we do not have today; right now anyone can start their car if they have their car key, but if everyone relied on radio broadcasts to start your engine then we would rely on a government (or instgaters of a coup) not to stop, or threaten to stop, the radio transmissions.

Looks like the law in iceland may technically have been broken, as the law says "The Central Bank of Iceland has sole right to issue bank notes, to have coins
minted and issued, *or to issue other currency which could circulate in place of bank notes
or lawful coins*."
So it's a fair and reasonable challenge for The Home Association of Iceland to make in court

Fork that shit

At first I thought you had written a postal address
@_date: 2016-06-21 22:21:09
What the fork?!
@_date: 2019-11-08 22:22:49
Yes. What do you make of it?

On pretty much any OS you can download and run the bitcoin client and the node will sync (download blockchain). Takes very long of course. If you mean an OS that has most of the blockchain on it already, I don’t know. Haven’t heard of this.

Are you being serious, like you want it to hit a buy order? Or are you being ironic? I can tell which.
@_date: 2019-10-29 02:27:48
This type of feeling suggests the possibility it may go even lower. Edit:  how low would it have to go for you to be discouraged from buying?

In theory but in practice far from it. The most obvious example is slavery.

The experiment that proved the concept, and which was taken further by other blockchain platforms, like ethereum for example 
@_date: 2016-02-22 01:04:49
Yes it has finally arrived.

So is this why the word "Develop" is used here in this quote on the rootstock.ie website


So in other words..not yet developed.
I should add that here's a disappointing amount of transparency on their site.

In percentage terms what would you say is roughly the proportion of bullish verses bearish opinions out there in the mainstream media?
