I can buy it in liquor stores and grocery stores here... pretty sure the content is regulated, it's mass-produced.
How long ago are you talking about? Are you sure about your statement? Depending on what I eat, I can drink alot and not get drunk. I'm not doubting you, just looking for some insight, assuming your username checks out :)

Explain the difference between "stealth phase" and "return to mean".
You'll change your mind all by yourself.

What you fail to see, scrubtrollet, is that you never own paper money.  If you think you do, film yourself burning it in front of the police.

Kinda jealous, that alot of btc!  Hodl.
