So you're saying that the "dips" of the graph somehow encode the buying/selling habits of the population, and can be used to predict future movement?
That's crazy-talk akin to saying "three heads, two tails, three heads, two tails .. ergo the next flip will be tails."

Credit card companies get income from two sources:
* The merchants pay fees for the privilege of accepting money from customers.
* The interest charged to users who carry a balance.
Even if every single user paid their bill on time, and was given a small reward, they would still be in-profit based solely on the merchant-fees.

The good thing is that you can lookup the value they'll pay on their website - and it will be the same regardless of which store you visit.
(They offer two prices "cash" + "store credit".  While most of their prices are poor sometimes there are things that are in demand enough that it's worth selling there.)

Honestly I'm not sure.  But given the history of technology it doesn't seem reasonable that the first wide-spread implementation will be the one we're still using years later.
I do suspect there will be more discussion on the implementation ahead of time, much like how crypto algorithms are selected for standard-purposes.  Rather than have all the details appear from nowhere by an unknown author.
Promoting, understanding, encouraging the first crypto-currency is hard.  But future ones will get easier and that can't be a bad thing.

That turned out better than expected.

"Paid" not "Payed".

Well yes and no.
I believe eventually we will have some kind of "internet coin".  I do not believe in a 100 years we'll be using bitcoin, but it is testing the waters.  It's a useful starting point, and so on that basis I believe in it.  Ultimately though I suspect we'll be looking for a future-coin.

I guess he probably doesn't read/reply to his twitter account.
I'd almost kill to share a meal with that bloke though, he's a pretty awesome character.

You can program the private half of the key though, can't you?  I expect that was done.

And the fees charged to the merchants.
Even if every credit-card owner paid their bill fully, on-time, there would still be profit to be had.

The jury will make their vote/decision on the information presented to them by the prosecution and the defense.  No outside research is permitted, enoucraged, or necessary.

Your job is not to check facts.  Your job is to weigh arguments.
I've sat in a jury numerous times,  if you have you'll know how it works.
You're not allowed to go reading newspapers, doing internet searches, or similar.  You have to weigh the evidence using your best judgement, starting with the obvious assumption that people are telling the truth...

What a lovely idea; good luck to all involved :)

That's damn generous; you're doing a good thing for the community, but be careful you don't donate more than you can afford.

I suspect somebody who doesn't spot the difference between $ and  € is not __yet__ going to be able to handle bitcoins.

I'm amazed somebody has the patience to handle the giveaway - unless there is a bot involved?

The problem is that if everybody thinks like that, and just hoards their coins, in five years the scarcity will mean that people _can't_ use them either. 
Services won't spring up, and remain, unless people use their coins, and make those services worthwhile.

Why did you buy them?
*  Do you wish to exchange the coins for goods and services?  If so keep them.
* Did you wish to make easy money by gambling?  If so you lost.  Don't do it again.

node.js is proven to work in a highly-scalable fashion, which seems like a good fit here.
Yes you'd get gains from using haskell, but using node.js isn't an amateur decision in and of itself - with the right test-suite and similar frameworks it is productive, stable, and scalable.
