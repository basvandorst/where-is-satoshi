 “Investment into Bitcoin is speculative, in that as a currency there is nothing backing it other than the belief it has value. Thus, it’s important to never invest more than you can afford to lose. If you do choose to invest in Bitcoin and it appreciates in price, it’s always smart to sell enough Bitcoin to cover your initial investment. That way, everything left is profit. At this point you’ve reduced all of your risk, and you’re in a situation to make more logical and less emotional investment decisions going forward.

Crypto currencies could replace fiat currencies and banks will have their own cryptos . They will offer loans etc based on crypto tokens when it becomes mainstream. This may happen in future but not near future.
Have a look at Gartner chart on emerging technologies where it talks about blockchain , IOT, AI and Robotics etc becoming mainstream adoption in 10+ years. Once that happens all major assets will get digital in developed countries.
Offcourse in developing countries the cycle takes more time.

Its simple considering  their long transaction confirmation time. The ATM generates an address, and prints it.
You leave the ATM and use your mobile wallet to fund the address. When you see that the transaction is confirmed, you go to the ATM.
You select the funded address function, and the ATM scans the printed paper that has been printed for you. The ATM finds that the transaction is confirmed, and gives you the cash.
