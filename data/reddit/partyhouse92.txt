HOW IS THIS LEGAL!!????????????

Car salesman here
It’d be just like using a trade. We set the approximate value, which of course is going to be well below most going rates at any given time, you sign contract, pay us the coin and you’re g2g like a Crunchwrap.
Could be a down payment or full value. 
What I’m not exactly sure of is how taxes work for the business. Sales tax would just get put into the OTD figure as any other deal. 
So say btc is an even 10k. Dealer could use even 5k as the rate, (maybe wouldn’t go that low but I’m exaggerating). Now when the dealer exchanged btc to fiat, they are up that much more profit. 
Source- worked for a dealer that would take “ANYTHING IN TRADE” boats to goats.

I haven’t done a withdraw on it yet but Abra seems a pretty straightforward app that allows you to buy and sell bitcoin easily. 
I have my bank account attached. On the app you can easily convert currencies like bitcoin to litecoin or litecoin to USD. From there you can move USD into your bank account, all seems pretty easy. 
Anyone PLEASE correct me if I’m wrong.

I don’t get the logic theeerrree... but, I’m pretty sure he’s just poking at the fact you are a trans lesbian. It’s just contradictory compared to the huge debates/arguments/fights that the rest of the trans community has put up in order to be addressed as their preferred sex.
Frankly, I don’t understand how it’s relevant to he story in the least. The only thing it does is let us know that, when you say girlfriend you want us to know you’re not a swinging dick kinda dude, you’re actually a trans man with a gf. Which I mean is cool and all but, it’s just unnecessary details.
All in all I had a small chuckle reading it. It’s your business how you invest, so do you. The people have a point about paying off your debt that’s got an automatic shovel attached to it but people do worse things with their money. I hope it pays off for you guys cause that means it’ll pay off for me too!

Riddle me this..
You want bitcoin to grow? Do you ACTUALLY even? 
Want bitcoin to be popular? What is popular? Facebook. Evening news of the new dead black guy. Trump smacking Vince McMahon........... Stupid shit anyway... sheepledoingsheeplethings.sorry...
The point being? People want easy. Especially the technologically deprived. You know who that is? More then the people you think off, in this world. These people, that you NEED in order to grow, have no clue how to bitcoin. (I have money hodl'ed places and as much as I have looked into it, A LOT of me is just believing in the people. That, I know, is stupid.. Never trust anyone, not even yourself right?)
I have done a fair amount of research, and yet to find a way to easily convert currency (where someone isn't literally trying to chop your fucking arm off) into the appropriate "paper". 
What I'm the GOD DAMN FUCK makes you believe your average god damn sheep will put in the time that I did, unsuccessfully, in order to find the answer?
I know!, I'm looking in the wrong places..thanksgoogleforbeingbiasedasfuckandnotgivingmeachoice. How do you expect the technologically challenged to be able to do THIS? 
Can we fucking do this at all? Could you ever fucking expect for a normal joe to be able to walk into McDonalds for a Double Cheese Burger, if no one can figure out how EXACTLY bitcoin works? I'd like to believe you aren't one of the retarded fucking sheeple I think you are anyway...knowingnothingaboutnothingbutatthesametimetryingyoursuperhardesttoknowaboutsomething. 
Bitcoin was built around the people, not the needyfucksthatneeddearlypossesionstjathopefullytheydontdietomorrowwithsosomeonecanstealeverythingtheyeverwhere. Yea whatever
Just some thoughts. Sorry for the rant/
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:55:15
Simply put, selling lowers demand and raises supply, for that time being. 
So when the price reach nearly 5k, and people are invested in the sub 2s or 3s or 4s and they made (in some cases a substantial) profit and then a large portion of these people sell AND THEN the people who bought late during the rise start seeing the price go down and they panic sell, that's when price drops
Price goes back up after the people who cashed out reinvest, or the people didn't panic sell and just bought the dip, thus proving there is still plenty of value there, that's when more people buy and prices go up
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:47:20
Yep.. thanks for the help. 
Does nobody know? I'm not a smart person, never claimed to be. But it's hard to find other sources that aren't trying to fuck your brains on returns. Bitcoin is about not being controlled. Well, right now, I'm feeling controlled in that my money is tied up and no where I search offers ACTUAL GOOD ADVICE on what to do. 
I know I can spend it a million places. I said I'm not smart, not that I'm stupid. Can't exactly pay my power bill IF I NEED TO IMMEDIATELY in bitcoin. 
Can we please, for a god damn second, think about the freedom of wealth IN WHICH BITCOIN WAS ESTABLISHED. 
No, I'm in no dire need to sell my coin but I would like to know how for when the time comes. Please? Be people? Be the people bitcoin intended? Not the people that opportunity like bitcoin makes? 
There ARE ARE ARE ARE ARE ARE people in my boat, who want to jump into bitcoin (which produces interest that YOU FUCKING NEED) unsure of how they can (and excuse me for saying easy BUT PEOPLE NEED EASY TO MAKE SENSE) easily return there money, into actually stated money. I know we all validate btc as actual currency , but electric companies don't, rent companies don't, water, gas, insurance, phone, etc............. don't. 
Please help, me, and MILLIONS of others who NEED YOUR ADVICE into how to make bitcoin ACTUALLY FEASIBLE in DAY TO DAY life. You surely aren't so caught up in making money, that you forgot about why you liked bitcoin in the first place? Surely, you haven't been so consumed, by CORPORATE GREED you hated so much that you started to rebel against current and past economic standards, that you wouldn't go as far as to NOT HELP the people TRYING YO HELP YOU AND THEMSELVES with your rather simply gained knowledge, that maybe, just maybe you need to be in the right place to find. 
If a turned happened for the worse, knocks on wood, I still would have no clue how to recover. But god damnit I know you do. So please. Express your knowledge. I know. I know you worked for it. Countless hours. BUT IF YOU WANT bitcoin to be more global af then it already is, you will help the RETARDS like me. 
Have I not stated agreeable statements? Am I fucking stupid for not knowing how to google? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK THE PEOPLE YOU HOPE TO SUPPORT BITCOIN IS? Come the fuck on people. Like I said. I'm not smart, but I'm not stupid. Work smart, not hard is my philosophy. You want bitcoin accepted? You better make that shit smart. 
,crazy rambles from a stupidly crazy smart man
Or don't, I mean that's cool as fuck to right? Let's all just sit back, grab a bag of popcorn and watch ignorant people throw their money and lives into bitcoin, only to crash and burn, while we have a laugh. Sounds like a FUCKING GRAND IDEA TO ME MR.GOVENMENT
EDIT: I would like to apologize for the rant, but the influx of people with knowledge that act like they are better people then you, is absurd. I'm sorry I just started looking up bitcoin months ago and not years, please, if you'd be ever so kind to forgive me for that. I to, hope to be at your level of knowledge one day, so that I may sit at your side, and have an actual intelligent conversation as to the rise of bitcoin. Forgive my ignorance, as I seek nothing more, then to be on your level. 
To the moon. Infinity. And beyond. Bitcoin. People. One. 
P.S excuse the obscure language, I just felt I need to add it for emphasis..

Thanks for again mentioning a point I brought up a few days ago, and have seen many times before that. Maybe I was a bit dramatic, I blame the bipolar disorder...
Needs to be easy, or at least more a more user friendly community, to work people, let's go. 
Anyway, try gemeni, GDAX or the higher fee coinbase. If you don't like those options, just google "bitcoin exchange" and a bunch of options will come up. Research reviews and pick one. 
Cool thing about coinbase, is though you may pay a bit more, they have it integrated in there app. Makes it very simple for you.

@_date: 2017-09-06 19:17:48
I suggest using coinbase, just to start, while you are still learning bitcoin. They make it easy, they make it mobile. A noobs delight. 
Then transfer funds to the wallet of your choosing, where it will be safe.

It does show him busting his ass, not making any money and getting fed up. The decisions he made could be viewed as rash, and in some cases deplorable, but look at the life he led up to that point. 
He accepted there way of business and standards, enforced them to the tee and was brushed off when asking for anything, because "that's not how they do it". When you are operating at a loss whilst making a company huge and are continually denied options despite all of your clearly working all busting work, you might do some rash things. 
That said, the movie was just a movie. Some form of those conversations might of taken place, but no body was around to record everything that happened regarding the matter. Should be viewed as possibly biased entertainment and nothing more
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:40:45
Stop listening to the people of r/bitcoin. Not everyone here is as smart as you think. Most are quite the opposite, begging for a clear answer to be made in a post exactly like this. 
I will input my opinion, that bitcoin has great investment potential. I've done my research and continue to do so. I'm watching it drop again. I'm still invested. Only wish I would of sold at ATH and bought again where we are but GOD DAMNIT I didn't get blessed with the sight of the future. 
If you can afford to throw some bucks at it, then do. If your power bill is coming up tomorrow and you are looking for a quick way to make $100, then eeehhhhhhhh prolly not...

The main reason yellow shit and paper is worth anything is because the people with a lot of it says it is and control the price of that shit. 
If you think for a god damn second any powerful government will look at btc ATH market cap and not figure out how they can get their grubby sausage fingers into that shit, you are sadly mistaken. 
We (US) are not occupying other countries spending billions of dollars a year to do so, and not getting anything for it. I promise they do not just want to find ways to blow money for the fun of it. 
Someone somewhere has a big plan of making Bujumbura (idkautocorrectanditsstaying) bucks because they missed out. So what do you do? You cut the fucking markets legs off, buy it at half and then let it resume its course. 
Either that, or the world we live in just won't let crypto do what it was destined to do because big bank doesn't want to see anyone not under there total control. Which sounds almost right to me, I'm just sitting here broke hoping that's not the case

You say "everyone" as if it's not just the people who caught the tail end of the ride because they wanted to act and didn't but saw a rocket ship taking off and jumped to grab it as it was already hitting the atmosphere. 
Nevertheless, I agree with your statement. 
Edit: Just read 2 comments in this thread that almost almost prove my statement lol.
"I bought at $4500, so I'm at a loss"
"I bought at $4800, I thought it would go up a *LITTLE before plummeting*"
Wat. So now this happens, they end up selling at there loss because they weren't trying to have there money tied up for more then a few days, so they can make a small profit quickly. Now they have to take btc with a grain of salt and are scared to do anything because they don't want to just lose more. Gah

So my roommate and buddies at work all play and spend money on games (clash of clan gems, rocket league crates and chests on clash Royale to name just a few things). I tried. I tried to make them millionaires. Nope. 
Roommate is the biggest culprit. He just watched me make some decent money after this sharp rise since I started investing 2 months ago. Says my profits "aren't even worth his time". I could of nearly clobbered him. 
This past week he has spent, honest to god im not even joking, at least $200. AT LEAST. He said to me a month ago he was going to wait for a dip. Yep good job. Now he tells me his money is tied up, but 
"Hey, I got some crates, watch me open them and get nothing I actually wanted for some reason I just like to see how this system is designed to take all my obey whilst never ever ever ever giving me the things I want, even though those things I want just make my car look pretty, not actually making me better at the game, in which I'm actually pretty bad because I spend more time opening crates then playing. And my car still looks like shit!" 
He says something along those lines anyway

I agree. Just download coinbase, and if you really want then a separate wallet. You'll be able to not only easily buy a weekly limit instantly with your debit/credit card, but you'll also be able to sell! Not to mention it's the only app I've found for buying AND selling that also has ETH and LTC. 
Sure wishing they would just get back to me already

Here's a thought: 
Even if countries (like what I'm reading about rumors of china banning btc) do ban btc, what stops that countries people from still accepting it as a currency among private transactions?
What stops someone traveling from China with btc into another country where btc will be more accepted, so they can bypass the exchange fees of fiat to fiat, or even just easily travel with it?
I read this, very intrigued at your views, but I'm not sure if you were getting at it needing to be accepted more, if people need to stop blindly following the Shepard, if bitcoin has really any value at all. 
Nevertheless I feel that those three statements do hold a lot of weight in there own questions. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:03:12

Thanks for, again, reasking my same question! As I see it, no one creates an easy way for the average joe to buy and sell. 
The selling methods, I as a new crypto user have discovered, are there TO FUCK YOUR GOD DAMN ASSHOLE JUST LIKE ANY OTHER BANKING SYSTEM. 
I know things are simple. This is a very complicated process. But if you, the devs, the fucking world, wants it to be accepted, well god damnit I think you're an over educated fool for not thinking we need finer lines, for the under educated... Me being one, with a substantial (to me anyway) amount of money into the future. The moon...
Consider this a plea for help.. because it is. Not for you, or me. For the world. 
How the fucking fuck could you even expect more, without basic understanding of people. Stupid ignorant people like me and you, reading this post, trying to find out how. Yea and how about you gfy with the look harder bs... I have spent hours and even into days by now trying to figure it out. Do you think FOR A GOD DAMN SECOND the average joe will take as much time as I (a very intrigued newcomer) would take? Ignorance at its finest?
Or maybe just the natural greed that people develop with power. No one can stop bitcoin, right? Well, I believe no one can stop people either. And people will be people. Greedy ass people, who feel the knowledge they have gained is worth something, which is true. 
No one can stop bitcoin, bitcoin wok never stop greed.

They rarely have a position, other than "it will just be worth nothing" "somebody can just unplug it" etc.. 
It once wasn't very easy to get people to spend money on "pixels". But look at current apps. Look at clash of clans gross.. Apps/games with the "pay to win" or "pay to look good" scheme charge outrageous, imo, amounts so you get very little in the long run of the game.
Even with these people (I know a few in real life who do not have the same views as me but literally spend hundreds of dollars on there hobby games, one in particular is in the $3000 range and brags about it) you still can't tell them that a "pixel" is worth anything. And the 3 guys I'm talking about in particular have 0 interest of doing more research in the matter. 1 of them I got to download coinbase, when coin was in the 2s, and he was close to buying. "I'm going to wait for it to drop".. Yep, sure dropped. Now he is blown away, but still won't put money into it, but has spent over $100 in rocket league THIS WEEK.

Original? I made the post seeking an answer that hours later had views, but no suggestions on what to do. 
Still don't know how to sell lol. 
I'm on board with bitcoin. Choo choo. How do I even begin to convince my dad, who has far less technological intelligence then I (and mine isn't so vast to begin with) if I've spent days researching and still can't find a way to sell *easily*. 
Bitcoin will peak interest. It's pretty easy to buy bitcoin. So me the tab in FAQ for newcomers that lays how to sell out. I read the whole thing, as well as many of the never ending links. 
These truths I find to be self evident.
I believe things will get easier as you've said. Before that happens though, people need to be able to freely trade, while not getting fucked because they are me and can't figure how to get there money back. Not in dire need but I pretty blindly and ignorantly threw money into bitcoin after reading through r/bitcoin, after I was introduced to bitcoin by a merchant. 
Shit yea, if you find something you want to buy online through a merchant, it's a fairly easy process once you understand the absolute basics of bitcoin. 
Sorry for another book to read, I'm flabbergasted at the no response I've received. It would almost make someone second guess
