I had this exact same thing happen yesterday. Damned if I know why, but it cleared in an hour or so. All the inputs were confirmed.  However, something in the transaction was wonky, as it made some wallets that then tried to spend the results freak out with "transaction non standard"

The keypad problem has been fixed, it was a combination of using different glue and judicious trimming of the top-layer pcb. All of the keys now have a decent "click". Plus, we've been able to inset the faceplate in the edge of the case (as opposed to having it on top as before). Makes for better edges and more precise assembly.

If you want to get your hands dirty, check this awesome post:
For anyone with programming &amp; logic skill, it's a very good introduction into exactly what happens when you use bitcoin. Also "Mastering Bitcoin" from O'Reilly is good, but much more comprehensive and not quite the detail as the first article.
Almost all other descriptions are good, but high-level.

Thanks for the mention of BitLox. It works as a signing device, like most hardware wallets, but what I feel sets it apart is that it has a full keypad plus a 2" epaper screen. All of the "secure" stuff, like entering a mnemonic, is done directly on the device. It uses external apps (web/Chrome/iOS/Android) to set up the transactions from the public blockchain. The BitLox itself is never in communication with the Internet. FYI

We are working on support for some of the desktop wallet software such as Electrum, Multibit etc. There's a fair bit of code to write and each one goes about this differently.
We currently have a web app that works with a plug-in, a Chrome app, and iOS/Android apps. The code for these apps is on GiHub ( It's all JavaScript so is fairly straightforward.
There's also an expert mode in these apps where you can check the returned hex code before sending a transaction to the network.

Yea, i2p support for now is somewhat experimental. The main difficulty with i2p as far as I see from a web app point of view is that there are very few exit nodes if any part of your code needs to pull in clearnet resources.

Pretty damn safe. But a lot of it depends on your OpSec frankly. If you really want to fly under the radar, it's not just your software/OS, but a whole mindset and method of doing things that has to be worked on.
For example, using Tails or Qubes OS is a good start... but frankly they are a real PiTA to get used to...

Of course, you can also set up a "normal" wallet that appears in the wallet listings with a nominal amount of coins. Then keep your real stash in a "hidden" wallet - these do not show up on any device wallet listing and cannot be accessed unless you know both the wallet number and the PIN of that particular wallet.
@_date: 2016-06-01 12:41:50
Depending on the configuration of your paper wallet, you can enter the private key into the core Bitcoin client and it will have all your funds still there. Then just do a new transaction with a higher fee. This is how I personally cleared a transaction sent from blockchain.info when they inexplicably included no fees at all.
@_date: 2016-06-10 10:08:11
BitLox has this. If when you are asked for the device PIN (which is input directly on the onboard keypad) you type "911" then the BitLox looks as if it is properly authenticating. Meanwhile, in the background it is doing a reformat of the entire wallet space, rendering it factory-fresh.

I'm a wallet developer ([Bitlox](
This is the first time I've ever heard someone request this feature, but it sounds intriguing. I'll have to see about including this in our dev cycle, at least available under the "expert" menu so it will not be accidentally used by someone. 
What I'm wondering is what would happen if the funds were locked with this, but the transaction was RBF enabled? (of course could just not enable RBF for such transactions, but what if? Hmmm)
@_date: 2017-01-09 07:15:34
One way we do it at [BitLox]( is that you can inspect the signed transaction being returned from the wallet. You can run it through a number of decoders online, or a local bitcoind instance. That way you know that what you are transmitting is exactly what you want to send.

I have a BTCC account and use it regularly. Been living in China 15 years now. 
The KYC requirements are not particularly onerous; you link your mobile phone, send them copies of your ID &amp; utility bill. That's pretty much it. The bank account you link has to have the same name as your account name. (This can sometimes be a hassle, as Chinese banks can be very "creative" as to how they write foreigners' names in English)
Some of the other exchanges have "graduated" KYC, in that for say transaction volume under 500 RMB (~$72) you only need a linked mobile. That will probably change to the full KYC such as BTCC has.
Oh, and for some reason OKCoin would not even process applications for US citizens. Probably the hideous FATCA strikes again.

For hardware wallets this is a moot point. Hardware wallets don't know about or care about the block size. The thing that SegWit brings to them is that they don't have to send the whole block of the source inputs' transaction into the device to be able to deduce the fee.
SegWit versus bigger blocks is a completely different argument though.

You might also want to take a look at [BitLox]( - the prices start at $98 for a card shaped wallet with an e-paper screen, USB and Bluetooth.

SegWit will certainly be a plus for hardware wallets. Because of constrained memory space, all the transaction data has to be parsed while streaming, which can (as the article says) for some transactions bog down the device, especially if the inputs were part of a massive payout transaction (gobs and gobs of outputs of which "yours" is one of).
Revised firmware to handle SegWit (we're working on it!) should be able to handle both SegWit and non-SegWit transactions, at least for the BitLox, and almost certainly the others. Anyways, just thought I'd get my 2¢ in.
If you haven't seen our hardware wallets, now is a good time to check them out, we've reduced prices:

I can only say how WE do it at BitLox...
When sending to a change address, it's a good bet you won't recognize the address, espescially if it's an HD wallet (like ours).
What we do is send in a separate message to the wallet the INDEX of the change. Then the parsing engine looks through the transaction and uses the on-device GENERATED address (from the index and your HD chain) and compares that to all of the outputs. It it matches, it's masked, as you have no need to authenticate that output.
The most someone could possibly do (nefariously) would be to change the index to something else... and it'll still end up in your wallet, that is if you approve the transaction. The parsing engine would throw a flag and you'd be shown the destination address as it would not match the "specified" change address.
Anything other than addresses that are validated as "self-change" addresses are always shown to the user for approval.
In addition, if used in expert mode, you can inspect the signed hex before it is transmitted (extreme but why not?)

Is there any code available for trying it out?

I'm all for hardware wallets. One twist you may not know about: you can set a "password" on a mnemonic, so that without this one word, the mnemonic recovers to an entirely different wallet. Pretty much anybody can remember a single word, so if you use that, even if someone accesses your mnemonic, they don't get your funds.
[BitLox]( has this (I'm the developer)

I'm partial to hardware wallets myself. They are essentially a mini offline computer that signs transactions for you, keeping your private keys off of any Internet connected device.
There's several to choose from. Of course I'm biased because I build these: [BitLox](

Well, the first keyboards were membrane type, but those have absolutely no feel at all. We changed to dome-style keys because they do have a "click" for the most part, though it would seem that the edge keys sometimes get a bit stressed in assembly and do not have the proper "feel". We're fixing this.

Well, the "breach" was all about exit nodes. The idea with this is that both the user and the app are in the Tor space.

We've got Litecoin sorted out, just are working on the wallet part for that. Other coins with Bitcoin similar signing procedures are to follow. Dash &amp; ethereum next.

I'd just write down or store the 12 words somewhere semi-secured (like the cryptosteel) and when setting up the wallet, use a passphrase (LOOONG one) for the mnemonic. This is an additional "salt" so if someone tries to recover the wallet without the correct phrase (or without a phrase) they get an entirely different wallet.
One word/phrase is easier to keep in your head.

Could always revert to pencil and paper:
[Mining Bitcoin with pencil and paper: 0.67 hashes per day](
@_date: 2016-10-28 11:50:15
Lemme see.... 0.67 hash/day = 0.000008796296296 h/s
0.000008796296296 h/s = 0.000000000008796 Mh/s per person
World population of 7.5 billion persons * 0.000008796296296 h/s per person = 65972.22222 h/s
Assume we are starting over, with the genesis block, so difficulty 1
1/115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 = 8.636168555094445 * 10^-78
Reciprocal of this = 1.157920892373163 * 10^77
This is probability of the average number of hashes to solve a block.
So, 1.157920892373163* 10^77 h / 65972.22222 h/s = 1.755164300077389 * 10^72 s to solve ONE block.
**5.565589485278377 * 10^64 years for ONE block**
Multiply by 2016 to get to the next difficulty - but meh, this is close enough.
**Current age of the universe is 432,329,886,000,000,000 seconds**
We better get scribbling. 
Bonus question: how many gigatons of paper and pencils would we need?
Parts of this calculation cribbed from [here]( and [here](
OK, that seemed off. I mean, if the difficulty is 1, then you get a very small number, but when the difficulty goes up, the numerator is bigger resulting in a larger result (that gives a SHORTER time. Wrong, obviously.
[Found this:](


So, let's try this again:
s = 1 * 2^32 h /  65972.22222 h/s
s = 4,294,967,296 h / 65972.22222 h/s
s = ~65102 s
~18 hours
Well hell that's more reasonable.
So the first series of 2016 blocks would take 4.16 years
Of course, this is with the genesis block difficulty of 1
Since the 1 is easily substituted with the current difficulty: 253618246641
s = 253618246641 * 2^32 h /  65972.22222 h/s
s = 1.089282074991957 * 10^21 h / 65972.22222 h/s
s = 1.65112230320132 * 10^16 s
~523,567,447 years to mine a single block via pencil and paper if the whole of humanity did nothing else. 
Or 1,055,511,974,649 years to do a full 2016 blocks to get to the next difficulty jump.
I like that... 1 TRILLION YEARS... muwahahaha

It's totally a question of the BIP32 derivation. Trezor promulgated the BIP44 standard (which is a specific case of BIP32) for derivation, that's what they use.
