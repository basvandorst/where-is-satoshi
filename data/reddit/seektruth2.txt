Thanks for bringing this up.  I think it's a little different than that.  Internet is about freedom of information and bitcoin is about freedom of money.  While I'm sure there are those in government that dislike information due to exposing corruption, with money freedom as people move away from the dollar its taking some of a governments revenue and power over people.  This is a much bigger threat to them than freedom of speech.

I don't think that banning bitcoin verses banning the swiss franc is a accurate comparison.  Its more of the war of ideologies between centralized and decentralized currencies.  Also if the US bans it other contries will likely follow as most also have central banks that have the same ideology and influence to protect it.
While most see currency as a store of wealth.  Those in power often see it as a way to influence their people to achieve their goals and maintain order.   The big problem I see if bitcoin starts to become a threat to central banking is how does bitcoin protect itself?  Since it is decentralized it doesn't have a central money making base to be able to hire legal defense and lobbyists to protect the currency.
That said I wish the best for bitcoin.  I am really annoyed by our people being manipulated by inflation, credit, subsidies, tax credits, ect.

I'm not too familiar with the technology but don't bitcoin clients need a standard way of finding each other and communicating? What would prevent a goverment from looking at the source code and being able to detect or block those communications.  Or also setting up multiple bitcoin clients to infiltrate the network?  From what I do understand it would be nearly impossible to manipulate but this submission is about monitor and track what ip addresses are using the system.
