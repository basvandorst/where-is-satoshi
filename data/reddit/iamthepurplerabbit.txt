So...the best way to use Bitcoin is to NOT use Bitcoin.  Did you actually type this and it made sense to you?  
@_date: 2018-05-02 02:43:20
Most of these idiots don't understand how BTC/BCH addresses work, and don't realize you can't lose funds sending to an address if you have the public/private key pair.  Doesn't matter if it's BTC or BCH, the coins are still accessible on whichever chain they were sent.
The ones that do understand this don't care, they are being disingenuous and determined to make it look like the app is scamming people because "muh bcash roger ver is a scammer'.  The amount of disinformation and cognitive dissonance on this sub is astounding

Whales will dump Bcash for BTC right before Segwit activation.  For them this is about making money, not picking teams   
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:42:04
I agree with this. Contentious forks devalue and should not be supported. Exchanges that allowed Bcash trading are doing crypto a disservice

Tethers act as a place maker for dollars, like chips in a casino. In this case, they can't be redeemed for cash, but they can be redeemed for BTC. Honestly I'm just not seeing what the problem is, can you ELi5?

Margin longs spiked around the time of Bitfinex's announcement concerning how they would handle BCC distribution for borrowers and lenders after the fork.  People were trying to game the system to earn more BCC (free money).  As margin funding gets used up rates increase.  When rates increase, people move money to the exchange to lend out.  This isn't rocket science
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:32:40
For example, I live in the USA and can't deposit cash to Bitfinex, but I can (and do) deposit BTC, sell for USD (or tethers? for me it's irrelevant). I can then lend USD (or tethers?) or buy other coins for USD price. To withdraw, I have to convert USD (or tether) back to BTC and transfer out. No dollars (or tethers? ) can be withdrawn     
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:28:05
Oops. I lost the private keys to one of my BTC wallets and sent some Monero to the wrong address.  I guess I can claim the massive losses I incurred as a deduction?  
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:54:48
It's just fud before segwit activation.  Sort of predictable actually, similar to what was going on before the split.  Helps suppress price for a while so whales can buy, then BTC price will surge as segwit gets activated and BCH will get dumped.

I go through cycles of this.  It helps to disengage for a while.  Keep your mind off it.  If you feel you have too much invested to take your eyes off for any extended period of time, think about cashing a little out so you can relax

Oh yeah, my bad. It was shorts. I just saw that this was before the announcement also. So I guess that doesn't explain the surplus of longs. However, higher lending rates do attract money to the exchange

This right here. Deposit to your Coinbase USD wallet from your bank. This takes a few days so make sure you deposit enough. Then transfer it to gdax. You can trade (read about maker/taker on gdax. Only takers pay a fee) and withdraw USD back to your bank with no fees

It is.  This same scenario played out after the August fork.  Look at the Bcash price chart for August. This time it seems like there is a much more intense social media attack.

Nice bullshit fud.  BTC has so much hashpower already it doesn't make a difference if they bailed or not.  They didn't switch over because they aren't stupid.  BCH is a pump and dump shit coin that'll be at $200 by the end of the year

I believe they make exceptions for Monero, since BTC and XMR are like BFF's
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:43:37
I'm not worried.   They can't compete with Bitfinex's ability to create millions of tethers from nothing, and use them to buy Bitcoin.  They've been able to pump the price to $8000 from $1500 in a few months.  I'm sure they're whipping up another batch of $100 million in tethers.   That could push us up over $10K or $15K in a jiffy
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:48:31
They aren't really fixing anything.  Big blocks only slightly alleviates the problem.  It's a temporary band aid

It's just fud season. Creating uncertainty and volatility is how the whales and market manipulators make money.  The larger the price swings, the more potential there is for making large profits.  Fud season doesn't usually last long.  Once BTC finds a stable price for a day or two, it's usually safe to start buying again.  We should be back to optimism and euphoria in no time

I think a lot of poor misguided souls bought extra BTC so they could dump both coins after the fork and make a quick buck.  We'll see how well that works out soon enough I guess

Coinbase couldn't possibly have handled this situation any worse

Right, because nobody would buy eth *and* bitcoin.  That would be crazy! 
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:57:28
How are they calculating that?  When I do the math I get approx 180% APY  (approx .5% daily times  365). Compounding daily brings it up a bit of course, but not *that* much
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:54:55
This is messed up.  Maybe try going to your own bank and see if they can help you?  They might be able to contact Kraken's "bank" and find out what the problem is.  Other than that I dont know what you can do

Personally I think it'll be a couple years before we see $3k again, if ever. The damage this scaling debate has caused is immense. I've exited for good.  I'm not throwing hard earned money into the middle of this childish political greedy clusterfuck.  Bitcoin has gotten too big for its own good, like anything else once there's enough money involved people will always be battling for control. Best of luck to all

I'm just having a hard time understanding how they weren't prepared for this. They told users to withdraw all their funds, what did they think would happen?
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:17:45

It's fucked.  They should've been prepared for this
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:44:15
There is no congestion.  Coinbase is taking 12+ hours to broadcast the transactions after users request withdrawal.  This should be completely unacceptable.  They should have seen this increase in activity coming a mile away when they told users to withdraw due to their lack of support for the fork, and they should have been prepared
@_date: 2017-07-26 08:47:47
They spent money tracking him down

@_date: 2017-07-19 14:42:11
Banks can decline transactions that exceed account balance
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:13:57
Because I am estimating for simplicity.  Compounded interest increases the overall rate by roughly 25-50% depending on frequency.  There is no way a daily rate of 3.5% equals APY of 28 million% even if you compounded every minute.  That's ridiculous
EDIT: Actually you're right.  I now see it's possible if they were using a rate 5% daily which Poloniex may have seen briefly.  Going from 3% to 5% daily compounded is a very large APY increase.  I was thinking 1-2% daily but a small increase in the daily compounding and it jumps up very fast
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:03:18
I've been waiting 2 months . No response from support.  Not very professional or reassuring. Been using Coinbase since 2014, they still will hold bitcoin for 1 week when ACH clears my bank in 2 days.  Can't wait until a decent exchange comes along

They basically told everyone *get your fucking coins out of our site or we keep your BCC* a week ahead of the fork.  No mention of possible delays until they suddenly had a 24-36 hour back log, during which time they continued to sell BTC.  Then they tweeted lies about Bitcoin network congestion

That's why I don't worry like this.  I know if I bought Bitcoins at $1 Would have sold them all at $10.  Maybe even $5.  If i had bought at 10 cents I would have sold at a dollar.  Only a complete maniac (or a genius) would hold from $0.02 all the way to $2700.  But good luck to your friend

You made money on something that tripled in value in 1 month?  Guess what, everyone did. In a ponzi scheme, everyone that gets in early makes money.  Eth is gonna come crashing down hard.  If you really look into the tech, you'll see it's all bullshit. It's Ripple 2.0. What people don't get, is that Ethereum the blockchain, and ether (the worthless shit selling almost for almost $400 a unit) have nothing to do with each other. Ether isn't necessary to run Ethereum.  That's the con.

I've had good experience with coingate/ simplexcc.  Fees are a little high, but you usually get the BTC same day. You may have to call the bank and tell them or they'll decline the debit card payment

@_date: 2017-06-15 06:19:31
The rates are sustainable, but not when you factor in a 40% decline in your bitcoin overnight.  And don't forget Poloniex always gets 15%, whether you come out ahead or not 
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:29:06
I'll buy it. Can I pay you with Dogecoin? 
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:50:01
I think this whole thing is the effects of this huge ETH pump and dump. ETH got pumped and is getting dumped so hard it's dragging down the whole crypto market, even BTC.  That shit is going back to $15 per eth where it belongs. once it's finished I expect BTC to float back up
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:43:18
So ridiculous and illogical it makes my head hurt.  Literally anything can be used as money. Cryptocurrencies are information exchanged as money. In a sense cryptocurrency is the most pure form of money that's ever been used

I don't even know what you're talking about, but it smells like a scam, or a ponzi.  Anytime someone is telling you how to make money, showing you graphs, and promising big ROI, it's bullshit.

@_date: 2017-06-11 18:18:10
Yes, they have utility. But their dollar valuation is almost entirely due to Bitcoin's success. They're getting purchased by people that think they already missed the Bitcoin train. I do think Ethereum (and I also like Monero) has potential.  The biggest problem in my mind is that the creation of more and more crypto coins only serves to delegitimize them all, Bitcoin included
@_date: 2017-06-29 04:41:13
No way is Poloniex insolvent.  That site is a fucking gold mine.  That's the one thing that makes me trust them.
