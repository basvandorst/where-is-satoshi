This idea has certainly been pitched many times, I admit there is a good chance at it being possible.


A Nobel Prize winner in Economics. He is a mathmatician with work on game theory and more.John
Nash is famous for his concept of 'ideal money' which is not backed by a government and can easily cross
international boarders. A declassified letter form 1955 shows Nash advising the NSA of cryptography techniques
and ideas in computer design that wouldn't become mainstream for 20 years. Nash has been a teacher at
Princeton and MIT. He underwent a stint of psycitrical illness which he has since recovered from and he
resumed his teaching position around 2000. He is known to have become fascniated by computers and as early
as 1986 used email to send advanced concepts to other mathmaticians. The movie 'A Beautiful Mind' is loosly
based on him. He died on May 24th 2015 and will be missed by many.
Some had speculated that he was actually be even Nick Szabo or even Wei Dai but pictures of
Szabo and Nash's death discount this. [Group Picture](
Here are some notable quotations from Nash

It's also possible that he really is some super smart secret guy and he knew something we didn't, likely about how he could be tracked. He came out at a cypherpunk list so he is probably versed in covering his tracks, but no one is perfect. maybe a new law gave juristiction, or a new technology or crack gave power to get closer than he liked.
we can speculate all day long. which is a fun past time

IIRC I used bitaddress.org long ago, I just went and remade a 2/2 wallet and it gives me 1 address with a 1 and 2 keys with a 3, so maybe it isn't lost of all hope.

What's the internet got to say?
 His last public post was on December 12th 2010 just a day after posting, “... WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet's nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.”
April, 2011.     
 when asked of his dwindling activity, Satoshi allegedly told early Bitcoin user Martti Malmi, “I’ve moved on to other things and probably won’t be around in the future.” 
There have been other reported postings from satoshi since then but there is reason to suspect those have been on accounts that were 'hacked'

I thought WP+WC was like $25 a month; or do you mean no processing fees like if someone used CB/BP?
What are your thoughts on mycelium gear? I've heard of the coinsimple but not the bitcoinway, what is that all about?

Completely unhelpful.

Not gonna lie there friend, your account appears to be a bot account that spouts variations of the same nonesense for a set number of comments and then makes one spam heavy post.

'On the similarities between Bitcoin and Evolution"
The actual process - 
A split between species (any concept) and clients can happen at any time and in varying levels. NO ONE CAN STOP THIS. A new client can be fully interoperable with the old one and have a new name, a new allele or trait can arise. 
Clients/species can co-exist for long periods of time, they can also diverge at any point for a number of reasons
These multiple species or clients can both occupy different niche area, even with some over lap
One can overtake the other is they remain in the same niche
One can lay dormant while another grows or dies, and grow in their absence
A previous species or old version can be the basis or common ancestor for things in the future
The concept or idea of it - 
Some people don't understand it ( aka don't believe in evolution)
'Scientists' used to think all creatures existed only from identical parent ancestors, there were no common ancestors.      
 They don't see how one create can adapt to the world around it, making the changes it needs to in order to read adulthood or a new species.      
 Similarly some don't see how one client can upgrade to be how it was described in the whitepaper.     
Some people think one client should never be able to evolve into different, or multiple copies.
