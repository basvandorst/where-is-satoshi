Taxes are for infrastructure. Justice is by law, free in most countries, that's why they assign you a lawyer if you don't have one.

I don't think "affordable justice" is a good term at all.
@_date: 2012-06-14 01:54:52
So you agree that if you want justice you have to have money?
Is that justice if you can only have it if you have money?
@_date: 2012-06-14 00:03:04
Justice shouldn't be given in terms of money or "being able to afford it".
Justice should be free and always righteous. Not the case, but, it should be like that.

I call shenanigans, there’s no way someone sees this crappy attempt of an ICO as “great news” for cripto, specially living in such obvious dire situation.

This post represents the worst of cripto traders in a nutshell: “Well yeah, the country is in shambles, BUT THINK ABOUT HOW GREAT THIS IS FOR THE CRIPTO MARKET”.
