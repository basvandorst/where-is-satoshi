Backed by Energy? Can you elaborate on that? I know how mining works but how is it really "backed by energy"? I don't think wasting too much energy to mine it counts as "backed by energy", as a simple network upgrade can decrease that energy requirement a lot.
Actually with this logic I'd say USD is backed by Energy as well - petrodollar.
It doesn't say it's *owned* by government, just declared:


Japan recognizes it as a currency for example.

Cryptocurrency is also fiat.

Then why use bcash when you can use other alts? eth, ltc, vtc, iota? What is the value of bcash compared to these? Think!

So keep hodling bitcoin but spend bcash?

What kind of different fork is it if not hard fork? Litecoin certainly was not a soft fork on Bitcoin chain? 
Your logic is a bit flawed imho. Even if you were right, then why not Bitcoin Gold? Why not Bitcoin Diamond? Or Bitcoin Classic? Why is Bcash THE solution as it's proponents try to make it look like? Whatever its history was it doesn't matter. Now it's a different coin with a separate chain having nothing to do with bitcoin at this point apart from borrowing it's name.
I am simply asking the proponents why are they pushing the adoption of Bcash? I understand you have holdings and that would make you richer but technologically there is *NOTHING* Bcash offers that is superior to other alts. I may be short sighted here, but that is why I am asking.

That is not how currency works.

Instead of buying new bcash to send to your friends or buy stuff, why not buy another altcoin, like ether? Or litecoin? IOTA doesn't even have transaction fees..

shit I thought it was a chain fork, I stand corrected. 
however you still haven't provided anything to back bcash superiority over other alts? at this point bcash is altcoin. we were talking why would anyone use bcash to transfer value as it is it's only use now, correct? not compared to bitcoin but compared to other alts. forget btc for a moment

Litecoin was also forked off Bitcoin chain so your argument really doesn't stand...

but what if millenials kill the blockchain??

I see this more as: have a savings in cryptocurrency while spending dollars for day to day stuff..
