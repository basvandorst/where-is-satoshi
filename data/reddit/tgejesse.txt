Fuck him. We need to drop everything he's said and forget about that squirmy lying fuck. It couldn't be simpler to prove you're satochi. It's not him. We all know it's not him.

Why do people not see this is coin laundering. Look at the address that the coins came from. The person clearly knows what they are doing. Can someone see if this transaction was broadcasted to the whole network?

@_date: 2017-12-14 20:26:36
An immediate increase to 2mb would be perfect. A simple one line update, will not cause much more centralization if any. Buys us slightly more time for segwit adoption and this lightning network to become a reality. I say its time for the upgrade. I'm kinda pissed everyone was so against 2x because.... well here we are saying we need exactly what that proposed.

After I saw my portfolio losing significant value, I reminded myself 'long term...' forced myself to forget until bitcoin hit about $700 last year. Now I'm glued to this Reddit once again.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:26:46
90%+ of the people using Bitcoin are here for speculation right now. Those merchants not using segwit probably have no idea about the opportunity cost of not using it. Normally education will fix this, but I think it's gone beyond that. Now, a little (very logical) guidance is a good compromise. If you really don't want segwit, go use bcash or another coin that aligns more with your idea of a 'great coin'.
Point is, people don't understand the cost by using Bitcoin as is because it 'works' which honestly I'm beginning to question.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:12:22
It was more rhetorical. I wouldn't actually do it. Someone with an agenda eventually will thought because it's a visible flaw.

Do you not see there's clearly an issue? We have people pouring away from our coin by the tens of thousands because people are too dense to allow change. Maybe someone should create a decentralized voting system to propose questions and have people sign messages with their keys showing who and what the PEOPLE really want.

You're argument is totally invalid and has no substance.

Why so? If we change the block size to say.... 8mb, I'm sure most people's network would be capable of downloading 8mb every 10 or so minutes. The average internet download speed in the us is 33.9Mbps.

Simply download a paper wallet software, make sure it is legit. Run it offline. I run it in a sandbox, with no permission to access the internet (I'm a security overachiever). Print it out, laminate it. I took two post it notes and colored them black and double layered them over the private key. Tape over it with packing tape almost like another lamination layer. Fill it with Bitcoins, and now you have magic internet money to give.

@_date: 2017-11-20 18:25:42
A %1000 increase in any asset will have people on edge. Its always been that way. Now I have a whole lot more money "invested" because of this significant increase.

You were right.....
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:07:05
1) You cannot deny the existence of sharks, they are there and they always have been. 2) Forks can, most obviously be canceled, therefore they might not come to exist. 
3)  The odds of a bad fork (of bitcoin at this point in time) is 1/3 (bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold?, and the failed b2x). Thats a 1/3 chance of being screwed. "Your chances of being attacked by a shark are just one in 11.5 million, according to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File". 
Your argument is not valid.

Ulbricht was charged with money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic narcotics,[19][23] and procuring murder.[20] The charge of procuring murder was removed from the indictment[24] although the evidence was factored into Ulbricht's sentence.
They didn't care to spend more time prosecuting because he was already going to spend 2 life terms. He was never getting out either way.
