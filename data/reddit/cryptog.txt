well in a word, time cycle.
@_date: 2015-06-07 02:43:48
well by the end this year, a currency crisis of the usd and eur is highly likely, imho.
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:33:39
Also, bitcoin is basically neither a currency, neither a stock.
So it is difficult to speculate on its price.
@_date: 2015-06-08 06:23:19
Tks for sharing your valuable wisdom.
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:28:58
the avg joe does not want to buy bitcoins, which is understandable but when the financial crisis comes in sept this year, there will be some panic buys.

Well I m not sure that the reward would be enough. In other words, in 6 or 7 years, the reward would be 7 bitcoins per block.
Even if the difficulty drops, it would still be 7 bitcoins per block.....
In other words in 6 or 7 years, the price needs to be multiplied by 4 at the same difficulty level.
If the difficulty drops, it is easier for miners to mine, in other words miners would spend less energy for the same reward but at the same time, if the difficulty drops, it implies less demand for bitcoins, which means a lower price.
I do not think that a drop in difficulty would cause a drastic reduction in terms of energy costs. And I do not think that an energy cost reduction would counterbalance the price decrease.
Therefore, with such a reward system, I am afraid that there will be less and less incentives for miners to mine...
This is a well known issue, which has been discussed since 2011 by bitcoiners that care about the longevity of bitcoin.
That is why raising fees is so important, which leads to the Tragedy of Commons...
By the way, Satoshi did not design an adjustable reward model because he wanted to guarantee the cap....
At the same he wanted to take into account Moore's Law; he wanted to make sure that he implemented a system in which it would be more and more difficult for high performance miners to mine as the circuits performance rises.
The problem is that the rewards are decreasing and decreasing...
We are stuck...really.
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:59:59
That confirms what I believed. Bitcoin is a "caucasian" coin, mostly dominated by the US or the shadowy gov of the US. We all know that there is a financial war going on between the US and China. So the interesting question is: What coin(s) do the Chinese buy? IMHO it must be Litecoin. By the way, Coblee, Togami, Lealana's guy all seem to be Asian racially.

mining centralization is much worse than thousands of shareholders...
@_date: 2014-09-04 23:48:43


Well people are starting to realize the extent of some problematic aspects, I guess.


Well I would agree on that one. Centralization of blockchain broadcast is obviously not good on the one hand. On the other hand, assuming that raising fees fixes the mining incentive issue, it is not good either for users and for promoters that promote bitcoin as a cheaper payment processing system than say PayPal.
I do not think users will accept to pay higher fees for a payment processing system slower than credit card.
Therefore I believe that bitcoin would not have any other choice than to centralize...

• There are also some ongoing investigations, which we cannot talk about.
Tks a lot for your investigation. It requires some guts in order to go and speak to those guys, especially when you are not based out of Japan. As a user of MtGox, based out Japan, making JPY withdrawals, your story is quite interesting and informative.
I was wondering. The government agencies and banking partners as well as "authorities" doing the investigations, do they belong to the Japanese government or is it related to the US?
It seems that around the end of 2013, there has been an increasing exposure of bitcoins and mtgox to the media in Japan, and consequently the number of Japanese customers has increased apparently. 
They sent an email this week apologizing to Japanese customers about the delay in JPY withdrawals and accounts creation.
So I was wondering whether or not the Japanese government has started monitoring them more seriously than before...

@_date: 2014-02-07 12:29:17
i can confirm that it is much longer than 5-7 days now. The current estimate is 25days it seems. I initiated an withdrawal on the 21st (JAN). I have been waiting for than 17days now. If nobody has succeeded in getting the JPY after the first half of January, it seems that at least it is taking now 16+7=23days, which is still within the 25days window.
Let us hope they will fix it asap and revert to 2days as it used to be back in nov 2013.

ok i see. yes a JPY withdrawal request to a domestic account. Still not processed yet. In their FAQ (here:) they specify the following: -* Withdrawals
All JPY withdrawals placed before 4pm Tokyo time on banking days are now processed the following banking day, and will be sent from our JapanNet Bank account. -
So at least I should have got my request processed on Thu last week...

@_date: 2014-02-07 06:53:57
it seems there is disinformation going on or non accurate information dispatched.
Apparently in the official statement from The Bank of Russia, there is nothing that bans people from using cryptos.
"The Bank of Russia warns citizens and legal entities, primarily credit institutions and non-credit financial institutions, the use of "virtual currency" for them in exchange for goods (works, services) or cash in rubles and foreign currency."
It is just a warning.

yes i agree but the economics is a very important factor.
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:46:26
he is right about the centralization of the mining and ultimately of the asset=bitcoin but i think the world needs a centralized digital gold so the unit price will go up on the long term.
and let us stop using the word currency for bitcoin. it is a terrible currency.
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:22:22

I made 2 requests (withdrawal) last week, one on Tue, the other on Wed.

They used to.
Now I have been waiting for more than 7days...

@_date: 2014-08-16 17:10:05
When we say Bitcoin, we mean the idea: the birth of cryptocurrency. We know it's not perfect. But we're not after perfection, we're after progression. We're after a way out. And we will not stop. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:06:09
bitcoin and cryptos are backed by computational work.
fiat is backed by debt.

@_date: 2014-03-01 09:25:27
right. So it could have been caused by some sort of pressure from gs and their friends.

@_date: 2014-02-10 04:44:35
tks for your answer coinsearcher.
well yes if things heat up i am sure more japanese customers would start to complain and when they complain it can get pretty harsh....
But if it is the US authorities it s not that new except that this time they could have started monitoring MtGox in a more massive way than before.
@_date: 2014-01-27 10:47:31
did you get eventually the yens in the bank?
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:45:21
yes but then again why mtgox does not make any clear statement to reassure the market?
@_date: 2014-04-25 06:01:23
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:53:56
true, it seems to be in the gray zone. That is why they need to clarify their stance. But to me, it s just a harsh warning. the statement says (after translation): "The Bank of Russia has warned that Russian legal entities providing services for the exchange of "virtual currency" in rubles and foreign currency, as well as for goods (works, services) will be considered as a potential involvement in the implementation of suspicious transactions in accordance with the legislation on counteraction to legalization (laundering) proceeds of crime and financing of terrorism." 
It says "potential". It does not say "definite". It you help money laundering whether via cash or cryptos it is money laundering.  My guess is that as long as you are very careful about who you let buy and sell cryptos= you are not committing laundering, you will be fine. It reminds me of the case of Charlie Shrem. He is convicted of money laundering not of selling bitcoins. I believe it is the same money laundering that Russia wants to prevent.
@_date: 2014-03-09 08:18:43
ok. so what is the meaning  of "stuck" in "mtgox stuck transactions" 1)?
the blockchain 2) plot shows that there is an actual transaction though.
and I would rather trust 2)  than 1) .
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:23:28
bit is rather the basic unit of information.
@_date: 2014-01-27 10:47:15
Experiencing the same problem right now. Made a withdrawal request last week on Wed. It has been confirmed but still not processed yet. We are Mon. Did you get eventually the money in the bank?
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:18:16
nothing is for certain but look at the fundamentals.
@_date: 2014-12-14 14:26:49
the usd will have much more longevity than bitcoin. the world cannot afford losing usd. it can afford losing bitcoin, easily.
@_date: 2014-03-01 07:36:29
it is clear to me too that the us gov or the shadowy part of it is trying to get a good portion of bitcoins and apparently they are being successful at it.
@_date: 2014-05-17 08:58:18
i remember gavin talked 3y ago about the fact that bitcoin would need to be centralized in the future in order to keep low tx fees. He we are. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 11:24:00
wishful thinking?
@_date: 2014-03-22 10:45:09
i ll give it a try with a small amount.
@_date: 2014-12-14 15:19:38
what if there were millions of shareholders?
@_date: 2014-03-01 07:27:21
because mtgox cannot disclose the info that the coins have been confiscated by some part of the us gov.
@_date: 2014-09-04 08:59:58
well I believe so.
peercoin, primecoin are very promising, at least from my perspective, in terms of design.
@_date: 2014-04-25 06:03:49
ok. in either case he is liable for the loss and must be prosecuted for that.
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:44:04
yeah. if the FBI confiscated the coins here too, the victims would complain in the open.
@_date: 2014-07-26 08:25:18
i see.
@_date: 2014-12-14 14:22:59
the volatility of bitcoin is permanent by design: no control over the supply.
@_date: 2014-12-14 15:21:10
Bitcoin, the protocol will last for sure. bitcoin, the first application of Bitcoin not sure at all.
@_date: 2014-06-25 04:09:27
well ok but then again, it is about "Bitcoin".
notice that it mentions only twice the word "miner"....which as you know do the crucial work of verification. 
bitcoin=first application of Bitcoin or Bitcoin + miners.
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:00:06
well nothing prevents mtgox from manipulating the price from inside.
mtgox is still a centralized trust-based exchange, as far as I know. 
that s the problem.
@_date: 2014-06-25 12:43:46
that i agree on. the idea, the concept of a decentralized trustless blockchain in which blocks containing transactions build up. that accumulation of blocks is specified by the Bitcoin protocol but those blocks must be verified by miners...which is ruled by economics, not by the protocol.
@_date: 2014-11-20 07:43:06
so 10 000 usd per day.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:46:08
yes no proof about the stolen coins.
@_date: 2014-03-01 08:27:35
yes possibly. in any case, there must be some sort of blackmail.
@_date: 2014-06-23 02:56:46
the bitcoiner looks worried.
@_date: 2014-07-03 12:58:19
do u really think that the miners will accept that?
@_date: 2014-10-15 07:06:20
i have been trying to explain to ferocious bitcoiners that Bitcoin is not a protocol like TCP-IP but more an economic and technological system and now those same bitcoiners mock journalists that think it is a technology....sad and ironic at the same time.
@_date: 2014-10-15 02:07:57

@_date: 2014-02-07 08:44:18

the IOU aspect of the coin was very FIAT anyway.
@_date: 2014-06-26 13:26:27
so you propose centralization to the rising fees issue?
@_date: 2014-03-01 08:30:13

@_date: 2014-09-05 00:18:25
I do not believe so personally....
Maybe you can have a look at what I wrote earlier about that. It is basically the counter argument against the same argument. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 05:18:36
It seems that the Cyprus crisis is becoming continental, not only Italian according to the same media: 
That s very good news for cryptos in general and bitcoin.

We' ll see but I do not think that a deflationary asset (ex:bitcoin) is a good currency so we need to try new things such as a coin which has a controlled inflation (ex: primecoin) for example.


It sounds like a fork...
@_date: 2014-09-04 08:46:43


I am not. I am just trying to raise awareness here.


Well. Let me rephrase that. He does not seem to be worried that much about the crucial issue of centralization. In fact I believe he knows that at least bitcoin would need to be semi centralized with servers broadcasting the blockchain. Soon a standard computer won't be able to download it any more. He said that in an interview back in 2011.
Also he must also know that they would need to somehow "raise" the fees starting with an adjustable fee system (which he is proposing) to keep on paying miners on the long run...although it won't solve the problem because of the Tragedy of Commons. My understanding is that Mike Hearn proposes a solution in which you do not pay fees because basically you do not wait for any confirmation any more. In such a system, the recipient of the payment pays an insurance in order to be protected in case the transfer of bitcoins is "reversed".
@_date: 2014-09-05 00:22:46


Yes for example litecoin. That is why I believe litecoin is likely to have a longer longevity than bitcoin as a decentralized trustless system.
Maybe you can have a look at this post: 
As digital assets close to utilies, I think both will remain strong.


I fail see why having a faster block implies being more energy efficient.
@_date: 2014-06-25 04:01:03
it is only half true. if you are talking about the coin "bitcoin", then "bitcoin" is an ecosystem involving software and miners. "bitcoin" is the first application of the idea of a decentralized, trustless blockchain called "Bitcoin".

who is he?
@_date: 2014-02-16 10:24:59
but how can you have a low volatility and a bitcoin price going up to 5000 usd within this year as more than 50% of bitcoiners believe when asked at the beginning of the year?
or can we have a linear growth without huge ups and downs?
@_date: 2014-02-22 12:15:42
Interesting question.
Well it s not a deposit per se because a deposit will imply an interest on it, I believe.
The laws used to regulate mtgox should be rather  probably.
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:23:15
we don t have any evidence of insolvency. why are people selling then? there is clearly manipulation. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 00:03:44

@_date: 2014-06-27 04:55:40

i feel that putting too much burden on bitcoin's shoulders would kill it...
@_date: 2014-06-09 10:40:33
looks that it matches this: 
@_date: 2014-07-04 06:49:57
agreed. the bitcoin developers forget about the fact that bitcoin is only 50% a protocol (the Bitcoin protocol). the remaining 50% is economics.
@_date: 2014-05-23 11:44:22
LTC will be a better investment than BTC in 2014.
The main reason for it is not the technical differences.
It is because LTC will see a lot of BRICS miners (mainly China and Russia) investing in it.

@_date: 2014-06-26 04:55:46
well ok but i think you would agree on the fact that bitcoin is nothing without the miners and the miners won t mine if bitcoin is not profitable to mine and its mining profitability is not something defined by a protocol , so to me the economics is a important as the protocol.
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:37:25

Wondering why mtgox is taking so much time now with JPY withdrawals to domestic banks. The longest I had before their new guidelines (processing the request on the next business day) was 7 or 8 days back in oct 2013. But now it seems that they got back to old, slow standards. Why?
@_date: 2014-12-14 14:21:23

hopefully but not sure. it all depends on the demand. if the demand is not high enough, the price will be depressed, the economic incentive for miner won t be enough, which would depress even further the price....

Is he trying to give a last more chance to the disappearance story by reporting to the police?
But he does not even use the word of "robbery" or the verb "to steal". He never said that the site was hacked by hackers.
Disappearance just means "I tried to make it look like it was stolen but it has never been stolen in the first place".
Also, if he has forgotten the priv key, why does he need to report to the police?

i am worried too that bitcoin lead developer needs to talk to the CFR. I am worried he is trying to collude with them. I mean Gavin said in 2011 already that bitcoin would need to be centralized, which is contradictory to Satoshi's protocol.
So I am not surprised that he went to the CFR yesterday.
I predict Gavin would need to leave the foundation because it seems that there are lot of bitcoin devs who disagree with him, or there will be a fork of bitcoin. But in the latter case, it would be much more efficient to leave for litecoin instead since it seems litecoin devs have been doing most of the innovation for bitcoin last year.

well firstly it does not change the fact that there are 2 components: the protocol and the economics and secondly nowadays almost nobody is a miner, which clearly separates the protocol processed by the wallet from the mining operation, imho.
@_date: 2014-09-04 04:18:26
assuming that what you say is true, i would tend to think that it s healthier for everybody to admit that there is no innovation going on rather than to perpetuate the illusion of the opposite, which is probably what is happening unfortunately for bitcoin (not for "Bitcoin").

this is the only explanation that makes sense.
2 hints given by tux:
  - "US gov doesnt want us to disclose"
  - "technically unavailable"
I predict the following thing will happen:
- the community will clarify everything soon. (by the way the press conference given by tux a few hours ago in Japan was laughable, i mean it was as if he was laughing at something) meaning we would know for sure that the us gov or the fbi or the shadow gov has stolen our coins
- accusing mtgox or suing mtgox would mean accusing or suing the us gov or the fbi or the shadow gov
- that will cause a division among the bitcoin community or the foundation: half will decide to go along with that and decide to get blind because of greed, half will decide to "fork", which would mean go to other cryptos, preferring to keep the Satoshi's spirit.
I personally would not want to contribute to a bitcoin community in which 10% or even 20$ is owned by the us gov, or the fbi or the shadow gov.
This mtgox drama is more important that previously thought. It would be a unique opportunity for us to disclose the shadow control and their disgusting modus operandi.

guess what? mining makes money because you can sell bitcoins for cash and it seems that it is still a profitable business, as long as the price is good "enough".
mining is a purely capitalistic, profits-driven activity. most of miners do not give a shit about the security of the network, I guess.
the big issue with bitcoin (first application of Bitcoin) is that its security depends on the price of bitcoin.
a technology whose security (reliability) depends on its price is not a technology.
most bitcoiners, it seems, are not aware of the fact that bitcoin is a coin (no pun intended) with 2 sides: one side is a protocol, one side is economics.
that is why satoshi entitled his paper: "Bitcoin: a p2p electronics cash system" and avoided the word protocol because he knew it was rather an ecosystem.
@_date: 2014-04-17 10:49:23

@_date: 2014-09-04 06:20:14
Mike is only mentioning issues like malleability that are minor compared to the whole problem of miners not having enough incentives to secure the network ultimately and most bitcoiners dismiss that as FUD unfortunately. So I imagine Mike would be banned as a traitor if he dared talking about more serious stuff. That is not good.

If the news is that the US gov has confiscated the coins of MtGox, I do not think there will be only a few bitcoiners shocked by this news, seriously. Because what would be wrongdoings of people that bought coins in MtGox in the first place? There is no illegal aspect per se, compared to someone that bought "things" in Silkroad, right? So such a confiscation by the US gov would be illegal and I predict a lot of owners would be angry at such an illegal act.

Well looking for prime numbers chain is first of all less wasteful than finding a needle in a haystake...
But beyond that property, primecoin is offering something much better. A naturally ASIC-resistant algorithm, which makes it obviously much more robust to mining centralization (which leads to total centralization I believe btw) and a reward design in which when difficult decreases (accordingly to a total mining power decrease), rewards increase, which gives a flexible, intelligent, dynamic, adaptive incentive mechanism to miners: miners are constantly incentivized to secure the network.
Bitcoin shows that only you need a high global hash rate but also a distributed global hash rate.
Primecoin is offering a solution to the bitcoin mining centralization issue. 


Peercoin is offering another solution to the bitcoin mining centralization issue, totally different from Primecoin.
I doubt the foundation would accept to integrate a PoS module inside bitcoin, as long as Gavin is the "chief" scientist...
My bet is that bitcoin would have to become a government or corporate-backed utility (centralized obviously) business.
(The same goes for litecoin btw, though I think litecoin would have a longer longevity as a decentralized system than bitcoin...)
I do not think it would vanish.
At the same time, it would be used as a digital asset traded by speculators and investors.
Conversely, peercoin and primecoin have a bright future as decentralized, trustless, payment systems, the original goal of Satoshi....
@_date: 2014-06-24 10:43:20

It is true that btc-e has removed the deposit box for rubble but it appears you can still exchange rubble for bitcoins.
If it were illegal to trade bitcoins for rubbles, they would also disallow the exchange function...
So my take at that stage is that cryptos are in the grey zone in Russia and businesses prefer to reduce the flow of money coming into cryptos until there are some legislation in place but my bet is that they would legalize it relatively quickly.
@_date: 2014-12-14 00:31:13

a protocol is a set of rules that dictates the way information is exchanged between computers.
as far as i know, the coin "bitcoin" uses that protocol, involving economics (miners) to make it work. satoshi defined in his paper the idea of the blockchain "Bitcoin" and immediately applied it to a currency, called "bitcoin" but he was very practical and insisted on a concrete application. that is why he used the word "system" as in "ecosystem" instead of "protocol" in the title, i believe.
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:13:52
yes but the answer is probably "yes", i guess. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:44:06
yes. I mean it seems that mtgox does not clarify the situation about the withdrawals (with a clear roadmap) intentionally. They leave it in the grey zone on purpose. There are 2 potential reasons for that:
1- they want to hide their insolvency.
2- they want to take advantage of the situation to manipulate the market
as I believe they are not insolvent at all, remains only 2-.


Well first of all we need to get back the btcs and the cash. I feel bad for all the people that sold a low price...assuming that I am right.
Then get rid of mtgox or neutralize it.

“Just as speculators buy and sell global currencies to profit from fluctuations in currency value, increasing numbers of bitcoin speculators are now investing short term in the virtual currency, which in turn fuels volatility. This has reduced bitcoin’s utility as a medium of exchange—no one wants to use bitcoin to make future commitments, or even buy a cup of coffee, when its value can change by 30 percent overnight. Unless bitcoin’s volatility settles, it will be used less as a currency and more as a vehicle for speculation […]”

new merchants that accept cash via bitcoin but no consumers that buy bitcoin with cash, to make it simple.
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:44:36
it s getting clearer than the 2013 price was manipulated by mtgox. more new will be coming up soon.
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:34:11
yes. sorry for the mistake.
@_date: 2014-12-14 14:24:07
because USD is a good currency.

well it is called investment in my case.

no relationship with datacoin as far as i know.

nice. Bitcoin will perish unless there are alternatives to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-06 06:28:40
I do not think so any more.

To entertain the possibility that Mark is in fact DRP, do not forget that the middle name of Mark if Robert in Mark Robert Karpeles

the japanese text is grammatically correct. does not look like the work of a Russian hacker.
@_date: 2014-03-09 07:35:55
yes but they are "stuck" transactions.
what does it mean?
the guy behind is trying to withdraw coins but fails at it most of the time.
if it is a robber that is better than nothing.

you assume that bitcoin behaves like a stock? I used to believe so but now I am not sure.

You must be talking about LibertyDollar but NuBits is decentralized.
@_date: 2015-05-12 02:03:38
My vision for b&amp;c is that if it is successful, b&amp;c will become the first decentralized stocks market place in the world.
Imagine the revolution.
On b&amp;c not only btc and other crypto-currencies will be traded but also any crypto-assets that are "Satoshi-based."
I have of course in mind all the crypto-shares that are based on peershares' blueprint.
Not only we can imagine that nushares will be traded on b&amp;c, but also its own shares, b&amp;c shares, and any shares that belong to any DAOs.
The consequence of that is that b&amp;c could spark a revolution in the IPO funding of any business.
A business that needs to raise funds will create its own peershares blockchain and then go IPO from day one and float its shares on b&amp;c.
Also, as jordan lee envisions it, it seems natural that nubits will be used to get in and out of the market...as a synthetic dollar as you use dollars to buy google stocks and sell them for dollars...
Last but not least, the dividends are rewarded in bitcoins.
The near future is bright.
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:34:30
Nice job.
@_date: 2016-01-22 23:56:53
where do u see they wrote bitcoin is not money?
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:06:13
hard fork.
@_date: 2014-06-25 08:24:09
i do not follow.
@_date: 2015-08-20 09:13:25
diversity is good (as long as it does not overtake bitcoin) but altcoins are useless.
@_date: 2015-08-09 01:55:41
because it is not a stable crypto-currency and never will be.
in fact it cannot become a currency.
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:58:34
Well I am ironic because this sub has been basically anti altcoins (especially anti litecoin) and now that bitcoiners realize that bitcoin is being forked, they have to acknowledge that they need to consider seriously the altcoin that bitcoin-xt is basically...
I have always been in favor of altcoins from the beginning.
@_date: 2015-08-20 10:58:31
Litecoin plays that role perfectly. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:58:51
well i am ironic or cynical.
@_date: 2015-08-07 03:33:09
Andreas claims that bitcoin's development is directed by a consensus in which a lot of parties can participate: developers, miners, merchants... but he is incorrect, obviously. There is no trustless decentralized mechanism that enables bitcoin to gather all opinions and make a decision about its evolution. At the end, the github account admin does what he likes to do.
This problem (decentralized voting) has been solved by Peershares and I am glad it is embedded into Nu (NuBits/NuShares).
@_date: 2015-07-27 06:55:08
Very promising. But as long as bitcoin is volatile, I doubt you would get a lot of users willing to spend it for daily transaction, sadly.
@_date: 2015-08-01 05:54:52
finally. he will go to jail. justice is being done. tks Japan.

Take a look at this project B&amp;C Exchange:A decentralized exchange paying BTC dividends

NuDroid is here to help Bitcoin get adopted by users via the stability of NuBit.
@_date: 2015-08-14 09:17:47


The issue is that coders have control over the code.
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:48:50
The 2nd issue of bitcoin besides price stability is the absence of decentralized mechanism that enables nodes to set a consensus based on their individual opinions. This is solved by PoS.
@_date: 2015-07-18 02:29:12
I cannot agree more with you.
@_date: 2016-02-14 15:20:27
is it an attempt to hide some insolvency?
@_date: 2015-07-28 07:12:57
Yes, exactly.
@_date: 2015-10-10 00:44:17


That is very very risky....:( How can you be sure that you ll get physical delivery?
@_date: 2015-10-10 01:42:14
I see....Good luck with your broker...If I were you, I would not be 100% confident...that I actually own gold. I hope my worry is baseless.
By the way, it the first time that I am hearing about Computershare....The issue of transferring stocks and dividends in a decentralized way and automatically has been solved by Peershares, a fork a peercoin by the way. I am a NuShareholders and B&amp;C Exchange shareholders, first forks of Peershares, so I know what I am talking about...
@_date: 2015-10-21 07:01:21
it could be that they are wait to replenish their stash from other accounts and process the stack.....one by one. That smells goxing.
@_date: 2015-02-21 06:38:59
"But it’s important to realize that Bitcoin is not a stock."
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:24:40
I second him.
bitcoin is just the first instance of the idea of the blockchain (Bitcoin).
saying bitcoin is the Blockchain is a fallacy.
if you will bitcoin is an instance of a protocol (money over IP=MoIP?) but as there are several instances of VoIPs for example, there are several instances of MoIP (should i say Money over Blockchain?) and the first instance is certainly not necessarily the one that will be standard. Take a look with VoIPs. We have: 
- H.323
- Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP)
- Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
- H.248 (also known as Media Gateway Control (Megaco))
- Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
- Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)
- Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
- Session Description Protocol (SDP)
- Inter-Asterisk eXchange (IAX)
- Jingle XMPP VoIP extensions
- Skype protocol
- Teamspeak
For consumers, Skype is certainly more widely used than H.323...
The very fact that bitcoin is too volatile makes a very bad money already.
That is why it is being improved.
Take a look at  for example.
Thank you

bitcoin is a trojan horse and hiding inside are all the stable crypto-currencies, in particular nubits.

I am based out of Japan. Bitcoin and other cryptos are still unknown to the vast majority of people. 
But things are getting started by Japanese folks.
Recently we have seen some media coverage (newspaper and TV)
Though TV shows portray BitCoin as more negative than positive (it s not backed by real work, it makes money laundering easier etc..), the BOJ (Kuroda-san) is genuinely interested, I believe.
I understand him. Japan has been forced to buy trillions of thin-air and wars-backed fiat USD bonds over the past decades...
Like China I believe they do not want to buy additional bonds any more. 
Now that the cabal is losing ground, I think they see more and more the light out of the tunnel and the ability of Japan and its people to decide about its destiny (financing is just the process of thinking about one's future) will soon return to them. 
I am sure Bitcoins and crytos will play an important role for them but Japanese people tend to move slowly when they have to change their habits...:(
By the way, there is a BitCoin meetup in Tokyo. It seems that most of the attendees are foreigners, according to the list.. PinkCow is basically a restaurant for foreigners based out of Roppongi (never been there)
But take a look at :  (japanese)
