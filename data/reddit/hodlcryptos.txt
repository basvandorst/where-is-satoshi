I don't think its completely a popularity contest, there are plenty of different features and reasons to invest or use different coins. There are different sub-markets within the Crypto market as well. There are privacy token, platform tokens, currency tokens, store-of-value tokens, etc...
At this moment, there is definitely a bit more of that popularity factor that you were talking about, but if you are investing long term then it won't matter. Tokens holding high price/market cap right now, will fall out once the market sees more traditional investors and matures beyond its current state. If a coin has good features and is well marketed and has a good team behind it, it will rise in market cap, unlike something with a lot of hype that never does anything.
Something I just recently thought of is that, of course, this market is extremely volatile, so, what seems like a weeks worth of normal asset movement can happen in hours in this market. That said, I feel like this factor makes it seem as though things that don't happen immediately seem as though they are never going to happen. For example, if a token that has been hyped a lot, but has not released anything, is sitting at a very high market cap, then it may seem like it has been there for longer than it actually has since this market is used to having things happen instantly. I don't know if this is something that is effecting you (whether you have noticed it or not), but I think this happens a lot in the market. Not just in the example I just used, but also in other cases, such as something that someone feels should be going up and is just sort of sitting around at a certain price for a couple weeks, so they lose faith and sell it off. In a normal, developed market, hovering around a certain price without moving for a few weeks, probably wouldn't make anyone bat an eye, but in this market, it causes major FUD.

What makes you think that anyone can create a CryptoCurrency that is popular? There is essentially nothing stopping this from happening, except for people (hopefully) being smart enough not to buy into CryptoCurrency cash grabs. Of course, anyone can make their own CryptoCurrency, but what makes you think that they'd be popular? I'd like to think this just happened with Bitcoin Gold this past week, where it seems like it is just a complete cash grab, so the price instantly, and continuously, keeps dropping. The value in Bitcoin is generated from the amount of work it takes you (or rather, your computer) to mine a Bitcoin. It takes a lot of computer power, which could be put to use doing just about anything, so it has inherent value, [here is a Twitter thread on this subject](
While these won't make the creator a millionaire, just take a look at all the "e-coins" that came out between 1 and 3 weeks ago alone. Someone essentially took created an Ethereum based currency for all of the top coins which were not already based on Ethereum. This inherently would, probably, generally be a good thing. However, this person literally just created a CryptoCurrency for some popular coin on the Ethereum chain, and then forked that exact same project, changed the max supply, block times, and maybe one other thing, and released them all as their own standalone currencies. The websites were literally all just a homepage, which was identical for all of them except he changed the name of the coin in the header. Of course, as you were describing, this anonymous creator kept a portion of each of these when he released them, and almost definitely sold them just after they were released since almost all of them shot up in value for the first couple hours, and then they all dropped down 90% or more.
Another thing though... Why does this matter? If people are willing to put money into these coins, then they are willing to put money into them. It isn't like these people are really being scammed (although, thats a bit debatable, since the codebases were essentially all copies of each other, and probably not even full implementations of the coins they said they were, but I haven't looked into all the code or technicals for all of these; if they are even open source that is). And even if a thousand other people created their own currencies that they just threw together and didn't care about, just to make some money really quickly, this should not effect Bitcoin at all. I think its safe to assume Bitcoin wasn't created for this purpose, and in my opinion I don't really see a reason at all that someone (especially Satoshi) wouldn't keep some of their currency from the start. I don't know much about Business, but from what I do know/think, its similar to how, when you start your own company, you are the sole shareholder of the company. You then give yourself a reason to work on your business (CryptoCurrency), and make it into its full potential in order to succeed in what you were dreaming of, and in order to make your shares (coins) worth as much as possible, for yourself to benefit from at a later date whenever you do sell them off, which would probably be much, much later in your life, perhaps when you retire or leave the company. Many CryptoCurrencies are actually taking this one step further and using Smart Contracts to lock away, the pre-mine coins and/or withheld coins, for a set amount of time to basically ensure that the company will work on the project until that date at the very least (since the coin would be worth essentially nothing if they kill the project obviously).
I'm not the smartest crypto-guy here, and I haven't been in Cryptos for 6 years like some of these other people, but this is just my 2 cents (or maybe more like 5 cents cause this turned out to be a super long post lol).
* Nothing is stopping people from creating their own currencies, and trying to sell them off 'when they are popular'.
* There is no way to be sure that when you create a coin, it will be popular or worth anything.
* Bitcoin Gold is an example of this (IMO), that just happened in the past week
* In the first 4 weeks of October, some guy created probably 25 different tokens which were essentially all the same thing, and I'd imagine he sold them all right after they came out
* People doing this (\^) shouldn't really matter, because Bitcoin has inherent value, and there is really just no reason someone making a shit-coin cash-grab should make Bitcoin any less valuable (if anything it might make it more valuable)
* One way new coin companies are preventing this, by basically locking away their withheld coins through a Smart Contract, until some date in the future to ensure they keep working on the project until then (usually 6 months/1 year etc.)
