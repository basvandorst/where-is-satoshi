Sounds very interesting! Elaborate anyone ?
@_date: 2019-10-07 13:19:53
Agreed. But we want more adoption!

cmon You are extremely defensive about bitcoin. Brushing aside os,  hacked routers. That asteriod comment was all that I needed to hear. I would write rebuttals. But there is no point.

Never asked for best. bet better. more discussion, knowledge.

5. DNS hijacking ? Compromised Router  ?
OP type "ping [trezor.io]( " om console ~~with~~ without quotes. Share the IP here. Also not sure if it helps but try running DNS leak test and share what dns is being used.

@_date: 2019-10-07 13:21:46

Open electrum &gt;  
Create new wallets with new generated seed phrases &gt;  
Write seed phrases on paper &gt;    
Verify by typing in electrum &gt;     
Edit: Avoid paper wallets with a single private key. Since the private key changes after a transaction, sort of. Seed phrases on paper are safe and all you need.

Honest Question: What happens If say 20% miners were to suddenly stop operation because of a govt crackdown ? afaik the difficulty would take time to reduce and in the meanwhile blocks would mine slower ?
