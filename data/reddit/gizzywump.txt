Right. Old clients, like the official client, generate addresses randomly as you need them, which means you need to back up your private keys. BIP0032 gives a standard way to generate as many private keys as you need using one seed.
It also defines a way to spell out a standard wallet string, like
which is the public wallet the corresponds to the the private wallet

I got a dedicated SD card for my Raspberry Pi, and installed the OS + Electrum and a few other things that would make paper and CD-based backups possible. I went offline and after generating the keys, never went back online again. Transactions are made using the "offline transaction" capabilities of Electrum.
Here are my notes: 
I have no experience with Armory.
@_date: 2013-08-26 19:59:06
Rough outline:
Offline Electrum distribution (separate boot media) that never touches the after key is generated. Master private key encrypted into master_public_key.gpg file with GPG. Then, back up mpk.gpg file to media (CD-Rs and/or USB drives) with passphrase-protected GPG key (you memorize passphrase). Store media in multiple off-site locations. If media is stolen, it's no use without the passphrase. If your house burns down, you recover the master public key from the media with the passphrase.
Two factor authentication. Something you have -- the media -- with something you know -- the passphrase.
Use Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme (for example, &lt; split the GPG passphrase to K relatives or close friends, any N of which can recreate, so the coins are not lost when you die.

Instead of a passphrase, it's best to just let a random number generator generate the root of the tree (the "master key node") and then save your private wallet key (the long text string that starts with "xprv").
It's long (111 characters), but still small enough to fit in a QR code.
You should put this private key into unbelievably deep and cold storage (so maybe not a QR code). You can generate child nodes, which become subwallets, with different purposes (i=1 is "personal", i=2 is "business 1", i=3 is "business 2", i=4 is "joint account", i=-1 is "secret"), and share them without exposing the other child nodes.
As long as you have the root node password, you can recover the child nodes for any given value of i.
And the child nodes are wallet nodes in their own right, so you can have as many levels of hierarchy as you want!

Note that the + operation is different for K1 + K2 and f(K1) + f(K2) since these objects are different domains. It might be more accurate to say there is a function f : E =&gt; P and two operations + and • such that
f(K1 + K2) = f(K1) • f(K2)
E is the set of integers between 1 and 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337 and P is a set of "elliptic pairs". Read about ECC for more on this (but it will likely take more than one sitting to figure it out).

- Each address is linked to an amount
Although true, an additional detail is that each address is linked to a set of "open transactions"... that is, coins that have been sent to an address.
A transaction has two parts: the TxIn and the TxOut. The TxIn refers to past unclosed TxOut transactions. The coins corresponding to all the TxIn parts are mixed, and reassigned as specified by the TxOut parts.
[So-called "coinbase" transactions are an exception. These are the transactions which create coins, via mining, and only have the TxOut parts, since the coins did not previously exist.]
If someone sends 1 BTC to 1FKYxGDywd7giFbnmKdvYmVgBHB9B2HXMw, and someone else later sends 2 BTC to 1FKYxGDywd7giFbnmKdvYmVgBHB9B2HXMw, the owner can now send 3 BTC from that address... but only by referencing a TxOut from EACH of these two incoming transactions. That's why "dust" (TxOut parts with tiny amounts of BTC) is annoying... because to send a meaningful amount, you need to create a lot of TxIn entries in your transaction to collect all the pieces dust together.

I use blockchain.info to generate Bitcoin addresses (they forward the coins offline for free), and poll blockchain.info to see if payment has been received.
I recently finished implementing BIP0032 wallets in  so I will switch that soon enough (although I'll still use blockchain.info to verify payments).
I will probably open source the payment library when it's refactored and releasable.

The hierarchy may be overkill for small applications. But it's still cool. I have a master key with a subkey for business and one for personal. Then I have a subkey for offline storage. Business is split into different business entities, and you can have one for each distinctive line of invoices.
But also handy is the standardization of a mechanism for encapsulating your wallet, so you can switch from Armory to Electrum without moving your coins or backing up yet another wallet. And wallet keys have a "look", like Bitcoin addresses.

When you invoke a subkey of a key, you can use the "public derivation" or the "private derivation". The private derivation uses the "prime" notation, so the 1st private derivation is notated as 1' .
That said, I don't immediately see how to recover parent private keys.

It's a way to tip as many people as you wish while still keeping within a weekly budget. It's like Flattr except you don't need the recipient to have a widget installed (you just need a private communication channel).
As mentioned on  it's also a way to increase adoption of Bitcoin by encouring people to get over the first hurdle of understanding what a wallet is and getting one. Once they have a wallet, they're more likely to be interested in Bitcoin, learn more about it, and eventually enter the Bitcoin economy.
Increased adoption increases demand, and the price, so Bitcoin millionaires could actually increase their net worth by using this service to increase demand.

I've tried to make the "claim" page reasonably simple for beginners, including a step-by-step for getting started with CoinBase that might even be simple enough for the non-computer-savvy (that's my goal at least).
@_date: 2013-06-28 08:20:13
The code at  is actually a little easier to follow than the BIP0032 document (at least for me, but maybe that's 'cause I wrote it).
Take a look at the subkey function, line 103.
The child key is created by calculating the hash I64. The input to I64 is the chain code (random nonsense) and some data. The data can be derived from the public key if is_prime=False. It's a function of the private key if is_prime=True (and so a wallet key with the private key already stripped out has no hope of deriving it).
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:05:05
You never go online after creating the wallet, so even if software on the Pi is compromised and steals your keys, it has no way of bridging the "air gap" to send it anywhere.
The biggest risk here is a compromised master key creator in Electrum. If you don't trust the entropy generator in Electrum, you could create your own.
@_date: 2013-10-27 18:49:34
Correct, that's why change addresses are used. All BTC coming in via TxIn parts have to be accounted for by TxOut parts. Anything missing is scooped up by the miner as a transaction fee.

I've done this. I use GPG on the Raspberry Pi to create a custom secret key that's protected by the root password. Then I use Electrum to create a new wallet and save the wallet seed phrase in a GPG-encrypted file. The Raspberry Pi has never touched a network since these keys were created (at least, not with that SD card in it), so hackers can break in.
Then I backed up the GPG secret key (with a passphrase on it) and the Electrum wallet seed (two tiny files) onto cheap CD-Rs, and put them in different physical locations around earth in case my house burns down. Don't have to worry about them getting stolen as they are protected by the passphrase on the GPG secret key. It's two-factor authentication: you need a thing (the CD-R) and a password (the passphrase on the GPG secret key). Ta da.

Isn't that an external service? ;)
But seriously, what's the root of your issue? Giving up privacy to blockchain.info (since you reveal to them that you have the secret key for the source addresses)? Or you don't like depending upon them?
It probably wouldn't be too hard to transmit this info to a local bitcoind instance. I have some sample code that speaks the Bitcoin protocol, so it could work with any bitcoind instance. I don't know much about the back-channel bitcoind protocol and if it even supports raw transactions, but if it does, this would probably be quite simple too.

Thanks for the tip! One goal was to do a very small, concise pure Python version as documentation so it's easy to see what's going on. An optional optimization layer is a good idea though... an import wrapped in a try/except condition gives the best of both worlds.

Full disclosure: this is my site. I'm a stand-up comedian and a Bitcoin enthusiast. I also run LaffQ.com, a gig list site for comedians (if you're a comedian, you should use it!).
Comedians generally are not particularly tech-savvy, and awareness of Bitcoin is not very widespread amongst stand-up comedians. But they tend to be a free-thinking and indepdendent, and many of the ones I've spoken to are open to the idea of Bitcoin. When selling directly to viewers at the low price of $5 (USD), the transaction fees eaten up by credit card companies are significant, and Bitcoin offers a way to decrease this overhead that goes to entrenched corporate interests.
I'd love to hear your feedback, by the way.

A standard for creating deterministic hierarchical wallets from a single passphrase.
It generates a tree of private keys (and with these private keys, you can calculate the public key/Bitcoin address). You can give someone any node in the tree, and they can derive the private keys below it, but not above.
Any private key node has a corresponding public key node. With this public key node, you can generate any public key/Bitcoin address to any child nodes.
One more twist: a private key can generate a prime child node ("private child derivation"), which CANNOT be traced from a public key at or above the private key (useful for generating secret change Bitcoin addresses).
Clear as mud, I'm sure.
