Ok lol, I understand your point, but at least it's a realistic prediction not in the millions like others do...  
And his point is valid, if the network, the amount of bitcoin user, double, the price will easily quadruple...
As I said many time, personally I don't care much about the prediction, I simply report the news.  
I do personally believe the price will go back up in the coming months, but whenever ppl ask me if they should invest, I also tell them their is the chance it keep going down, it's better to understand the technology before investing.

It's not exactly ban, the Indian Central Bank make it very hard/impossible for crypto exchange to access bank acount, making it very hard to convert btc in fiat or vice versa, but if you exchange crypto for other crypto you are all good.

Most of my videos, I recorded the sound with a wireless lav mic, but I often encounter some bad interference. So for the two last videos, I purchase a small shotgun mic (Deity V-Mic D3 Pro) this mic is not compatible directly with my camera or my sound mixer, I had to connected directly to my PC, so I'm not sure if it's my PC sound card, the mic or the emplacement of the mic that suck, but yeah I agree with you my two last video the sound is worst ... :( I'm planning to return this mic and get a Rode NTG2... hopefully this one will be better!

Buying btc with fiat hoping for long term profits, it's trading, just on a much longer time-frame.   
Most or all of theses tips apply to long term trade or very short term.  
Personally I did good profits on day trading as well as long term position, these days I don't have enough time to give to trading so I went back to long term holding as making theses videos take much of my time.  
I definitely agree with you that simply buying and holding is the safest way to invest.

I don't try to predict anything, of course I hope and believe bitcoin will have better days ahead, but I don't do any price prediction, I just keep buying a bit more when their is new dip and taking some profits when it hit new high.  
I don't think anyone can accurately predict the future!

I personally share your point of view, I don't have a very positive point of view on XRP in this video either

Yeah, no impact on the end user. Binance as a security fund just for that!

Obviously every major hack usually tend to slow down the market and this next week on binance could be calm with no possibility to deposit or withdraw… Everything is possible.
