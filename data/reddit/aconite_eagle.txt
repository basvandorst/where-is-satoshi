Which website; and have you actually been paid?
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:20:31
Good luck with that then!

Well that's really cool.  Good on you people and good for him; Edit - just to say, I respond in this way because I'd never heard of him before today.  I've been into bitcoin since about 2012, but I didn't know Andreas!  Anyone working to free people from the clutches of our fractional reserve banking slavery is a good man.

Why?  This WILL be the currency of the future, used and spent worldwide.  Of course it can't be yet; it's much too volatile.  But it will settle, and it will settle at a ridiculously higher final price than we see currently simply because of its scarcity.  People will figure out intermediary mechanisms that speed up transactions (I imagine bitcoin banks will grow up and a system of electronic documentary credits will emerge, making instantaneous payments in much the same way as letters of credit do in the international sale of goods currently - drawing on the confirming "banks" funds and debiting this from their clients).  There are no obstacles I have heard which convince me it can't and won't be used as a global currency at some point.

I got thinking seriously about Bitcoin a few years ago when I lost trust in the government, the central banking system and the EU in particular, after the bailouts.  I'll never forget the sudden jarring realisation I had in 2012/13 when they said all of a sudden that peoples savings in Greece and Cyprus would have to have a "haircut" to bail out banks.
Good luck doing that to me and my cold wallet scumbags!

Thats pretty cool.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:52
Yes.  When it does stabilize, at about anything from $100k to $100m per bitcoin, we'll be laughing.

Classical liberalism isnt a "left wing" concept.  The modern day American version of it might be but I would disagree.  I don't think anything left of center can ever be described as being liberatarian.  The whole concept is designed around creating or forcing equality, which means the removal of privileges, liberty, or property from those who already have it.  Furthermore, libertarianism implies, and requires independence from the state and the role of the state is required to be as limited as far as possible.  The role of the state should be to protect its citizens from foreign and domestic aggresion and to uphold law and order.  Unfortunately, our state and our laws have also created the concept of the "corporation" by giving separate legal personality to a corporate body.  Unlike a regular person, they don't die, and can "merge" with others to form superpersons.  These have accumulated wealth and power in a way only a few human beings have ever been able to and it is this which ultimately leads to the problems and social dissonance we see in the West today - runaway corporatism instead of free market liberal capitalism.

Lol.  The fear that the established banking and fiat system (and the governments which are built on it - borrowing and interest on fiat...) completely affirms the reason for it existing.  But "please wage slaves; don't break free of your chains....keep paying for your own servitude to debt".
The reason why people believe in Bitcoin is because we have lost belief that our governments are acting on our best interests.  We don't want our savings accounts in the banks to suffer a "haircut" when they need to bail out a too big to fail bank again, and we don't want their digital money which traces us wherever we go and whatever we spend.
People are beginning to wake up, and they don't like it much.

This is good...the people who will one day be using it as currency still do not knowing what it is.  This is of course meanings that we are still in the early stages of actualising its ultimate value.  We're nowhere near the bubble people are talking about in other words, and we're still early adopters.!

Really?  Burke disagrees.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:00:34
Its divisible into smaller units than a single satoshi so this is possible.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:08:28
So people just made him rich because they like him??
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:18:55
Too big to jail.  They are literally regarded as being above the law because of their wealth.  Why aren't we having a revolution yet? ?
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:41:54
Its not hold forever.  Its hold until it becomes a proper, viable, and widespread currency and its volatility ceases.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:32:03
So what value does gold have?  You can make one or two shiny things out of it??
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:25:37
So to be sure; what is the opinion on here?  The futures markets opening on the 11th and 18th are priming this rise.  Will we see a crash on those days? Or over the holiday period?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:23:19
This will be a great opportunity to buy more BTC!
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:21:35
Oh yes.  Theyre already being written!  Headline on the telegraph.com in Britain currently refers to an imminent UK "crackdown" on bitcoin.
Its really ruffling feathers; it will likely be on the agenda for the Bilderberg meeting next year for the "global elite" to discuss how to stop it.  Tactic number 1 ? Scare stories to drive a crash so that they can buy up the currency en masse and hold it forever; or failing which, criminalizing it I bet.

Been out for about 6 hours here in E Europe!  Just came back online in the last hour.  Saved me from panic selling tbh...
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:26:58
Yeah.  But considering I bought in yesterday...
I know I know...jokes.
HODL until further notice!  
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:36:33
Meh.  I bought today.  Will continue to do so every month for the next few years.  $50 a time.  As an investment I can afford to lose.  Lets check back in 5 years and see where we're at.
