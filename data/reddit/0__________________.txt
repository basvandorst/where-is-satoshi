Emphasizing this point, no block limit is a really really bad idea. He learned that one is necessary for security and dos prevention and therefore implemented one.

Bitcoin is the only coin that is actively penalizing lazy/bad actors to a realistic extent.  
Coins with plenty of overhead (Or if bitcoin doubled the base blocksize) happily let these inefficient transactions permanently take up network resources for negligible costs.  
If there wasn't any direct incentivization for users to be efficient with their transactions, nobody would take the effort to use the better ways. This goes beyond segwit and extends to batching or even layer2 solutions that *actually let bitcoin scale long-term*.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:45:03

Sure but this block in particular was mostly consolidation, see 
Input count	8,417   
Output count	1,638  
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:30:22
Batching and input consolidation make the "transaction count" statistic not very useful. An exchange can have a *single* transaction that processes 100+ different withdrawals to different users while still only counting as 1 transaction.
Unfortunately this is likely to be a reoccurring source of fud due to batching actually being leaps and bounds more efficient.
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:38:23
You can use a limit order with a limit price that instantly fills.
For example, if bitcoin is trading for $10,000 you can do a limit buy for $10,001 and it will instantly match all sell orders until it reaches $10,001.
If this was a market order you don't know how far the price will rise during that buy. If there was a lack of sell orders you could buy some for $10,000, some for $10,500 and some for even more.

This is actually secure depending on the implementation. It is similar to the old [bootstrap.dat]( which would simply provide a copy of the blocks for the client to verify instead of having to download them.
If the blocks were invalid or contained an incorrect chain, the client would quickly realize from it's actual peers and simply ignore the bootstrap data in favor for the more valid chain from the net.
Bootstrap.dat mostly fell out of favor because of increased syncing speed of the core client now rivaled the required time to download a torrent before syncing. Having the data local would still be much faster.

Transactions don't work that way. Exchanges should be sending one transaction to pay 10-100 people.

When you trade $100 of bitcoin (that you bought for $10) for $100 of an altcoin, you are selling one asset (Bitcoin) and locking in the gain of $90 from that specific asset. *Nothing the later altcoin can do will affect the gain you already realized.*
Pretend the altcoin wasn't a cryptocurrency but EUR or another fiat currency. You sold your bitcoin, realized a gain and obtained an asset valued at ~$100 USD (A $90 gain). Just because this asset isn't USD doesn't mean you haven't made a gain against USD.

A cold address being legacy still doesn't really matter too much. They shouldn't be sending from a cold wallet anywhere near enough for it to matter enough to warrant the switch over.

@_date: 2017-12-23 00:28:09


But you already have to send a transaction to a new segwit wallet. Next time you sent a transaction use a pay to many to send the remaining change to a new segwit wallet. Depending on your wallet this might be extra complicated to do right, you don't want any remaining change to go back to the old wallet.
There is no reason to move your coins to a segwit wallet before you actually go to spend them normally.

@_date: 2017-08-20 07:05:44
I disagree, fees are absolutely a cliff. Once there's even a single kilobyte of empty space in a block you can simply use the minimum fee possible and still get in the block.
Fee's of course wouldn't drop to zero, but as soon as there's any empty space there's no reason to pay anything higher than the minimum relay fees.
[Look at the current mempool right now]( transactions as low as 5 sat/byte are being confirmed simply because there's lower demand at night. 20% extra during the day **and night** is huge.
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:47:48

Yes, and that's bad. There's infinite demand for free transactions, but infinite storage is not sustainable.


I mostly agree with your point that they will go back up. The same will happen with 2MB or 8MB or 100MB. 
A properly decentralized permanent and trustless system has to eliminate certain use cases and force users to use the most optimized methods to be sustainable.
It priced out SatoshiDice which used transactions as an instant messenger to inform users they lost their bet. As such the chain is much less of a burden today than it would be otherwise.
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:10:18


The problem is there's not really a level of blocksize that leads to $1 fees. Either there's empty space in a block, causing fees to be as cheap as possible (1 sat/byte) or they are full causing fees to spike like they are currently.
The demand for insanely cheap transactions may not be infinite, but it's high enough to constantly fill whatever arbitrary block size you offer.
So any blocksize increase you create, you have to assume you will fill 100% of blocks from that point on. And any effects it has on decentralization for the years and years to come has to be taken into account.

You are of course correct there's cheaper options for normal individual file storage, but note the timeframes and redundancy levels. The on-chain storage lasts as long as they chain lasts for a one time fee.
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:22:50
The problem is that 25MB is forever. Every new node needs to download, verify, broadcast, and store it forever.
And that was just one wave, I fully expect that to become common place. There's infinite demand for *free* permanent storage, and there's an extremely high demand for *near free* permanent storage.
**To fill 8MB with 1 satoshi/byte transactions it costs only ~0.083 BCH.**
Written another way, it currently only costs ~$60 to permanently add 8MB of burden to bcash forever.

If the block interval is 10 minutes and you want 60 minutes worth of security, you have to wait 6 blocks.  
If the block interval is 1 minutes and you want 60 minutes worth of security, you have to wait 60 blocks.  
Past the first confirmation, the added security benefit is (on average) linear with time, *not* the block count. **If the block interval is 10x faster, each block is worth 1/10th as much assurance.**
(This is ignoring any hashrate/hash algo differences between the two comparisons.)

Note: The child transaction was confirmed in the same block. This was **NOT** a zero fee transaction.
It is a ~60 sat/byte transaction since half of the child's fee was used to pay for the parent.

No, the block height (id number 494784) would be hardcoded into the wallets to check that it's size is **valid**.
This wouldn't require any hardcoded block hashes, but just an extra "Check this block in particular more thoroughly".
This is functional for checking *both* sides of the fork. Wallets wanting to use the Core chain will verify it's &lt;=1MB, Segwit2x will verify it's &gt;1MB.

Volatility is relative. 
$AAPL is worth ~$160 (A 1% change would be $1.60)  
$AMZN is worth ~$985 (A 1% change would be $9.85)    
In any given day they can both change a percent or two. Just because amazon's stock is 10x as much per unit doesn't change the base Volatility.

The currently coded fork requirements for B2X is a &gt;1MB block. Meaning all btc1 software will not accept a &lt;1MB block at height 494784.
This means core can be further ahead of B2X, but when B2X finds a block there will be 2 494784 blocks, one of which is &gt;1MB.

I had not seen all of the fine details before, it gets even worse. In addition to the IP addresses and phone number, he posted the users's guid and shared_key to the blockchain.info wallet. (reply 
The shared_key is a **highly damaging** key that allows you to identify yourself to blockchain.info in order update your wallet's data. It is normally only stored inside the encrypted wallet alongside your private keys, and on blockchain.info's servers. After that info was public **anyone** could delete his wallet from blockchain.info's server potentially causing the user to lose all of their money.
Think if you had a dispute with your bank and your bank posted your username and password in retaliation and let the first person to login delete your money.

@_date: 2017-10-14 08:29:46


No hash is required for this at all.
You just make sure the block matches current preexisting rules. Unlike normal light wallets which just check proof-of-work, for this specific block you would also validate it's the correct size.


If you download a whole block you get the entire block's information, being format/version bits/block size. You then check this, as if you were a full node, to make sure everything matches what you expected. You then return to normal lightweight verification for the next block.

That would be the market cap having the effect, not the unit price. The two are somewhat correlated but not the same.


I'm mostly referring to this comment as it doesn't imply it's related to bitcoin but a generalization that higher numbers are less volatile.

Further mode, bitcoin nodes will rank it's own peers and **highly** prefer to continue to connect to previously know good peers.
So just spawning a ton of nodes won't have any immediate effect because all previous nodes will prefer their known longterm peers over the new nodes with no "reputation".

It's literally the exact same amount of stability.
Per unit price is irrelevant to stability. If there were only 21 bitcoins instead of 21 million, it would not change anything other that how many decimal places (or what unit) we have to use.

Why do you assume the person only has 20 billion instead of 2000 billion? Changing the unit changes holdings as well.
You're right that market cap does help, but it's not linear either. The important part is more users spreading out the total units, not how much each unit is worth.

Coinbase text "NYA" is irrelevant to activating segwit. Segwit was activated from a bit (flag) in the block version id.

No such thing as a spam email either. There *could be* a rich foreign man with no knowledge of the banking system willing to send me tons of money in exchange for an initial deposit.
Who is to say that any email isn't a valid email?

Beyond the fact that this adds increased complexity to block reward curve it could exasperate the SPV mining issue.
SPV mining is where you start to make a new empty block without fully knowing the contents of the last block, only the header.
I'm not exactly sure how latency/bandwidth/verification time of blocks would scale with say 1MB block every 2 minutes compared to 5MB every 10 minutes. But if there's sunk costs, where each block takes the same amount of time regardless of size (latency/network propogation perhaps) then faster blocks will result in more time spent SPV mining.
