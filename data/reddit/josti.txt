The GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER USELESS PAPER of a major exchange would seem to bolster the case for greater TOTAL FREEDOM in the Bitcoin world, although it’s ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE when or if USELESS BUREAUCRATS will step in to prevent future disasters. “It’s going to be difficult to argue with anything they propose,” says Brito.

you are downvoted because this subreddit did turn to r/investmentbanking over the last days. It seems no one wanted to spent bitcoins anymore because they were in massive deflation.
I hope the price settles low enough to scare away people "investing". The high price was nice to attract vendors where I can keep spending my btc (hooray for lieferdienste.de!) but I am really hoping for a lower but more stable currency value.
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:27:39
Ah I misread you. You mean nobody will transact with **altcoins** right? I interpreted it as nobody will transact with BTC anymore

but it will go down if miners decide it is not profitable and quit, giving incentive to start again if difficulty drops too low to have 1 block found every 10 min.
I think that's quite a beautiful mechanism.

I am not that familiar with Silk Road, but I think this was just an authentication measure but in by SR, not by the bitcoin protocol. Eith Bitcoin you have a public key (your address) and a private key matching that address with enables you to do transactions. In SR's case I guess they kept the keys to themselves.

Does Google Wallet accept Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:10:04


No, the public and private key are completely seperate. You can only regenerate a lost private key if the keypair was chosen [deterministic](


No the encryption is only file based. You would have two wallets with different passwords.


What about the creation of a quantum computer that would spell the end for Bitcoin?
Those threats all have one thing in common: they wouldn't only be a problem for bitcoin, but for the financial industry and information technology as a whole. [More Information here](


It is your responsibility to keep your bitcoins safe... hard lessons were learnt about that in bitcoins short history. Every Internet connected device can pose a security threat. You alone decide how aware/paranoid of security measures you are. Do not keep yor savings on a internet-connected PC... use [offline storage]( methods e.g. paper wallets! There are enough people crying crocodile tears because they didn't secure their bitcoins appropriately.
Before you invest a lot in Bitcoin make yourself familiar with the mathematical concepts behind bitcoin, at least the basics. Asking here is the right direction, but a lot of questions are already answered elsewhere.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:30:30
sorry if I sounded rude.
There is no way to get the seized coins without providing the private key. If the bitcoins were really seized the FBI now has this key and no one else can access these funds except DPR has another key hidden somewhere and sends the money ro a new address before the FBI has the chance to do.
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:28:39
Do they really want a canadian ID? I have no knowledge of canadian Exchanges but most other exchanges only require any ID document and a proof of residency (e.g. utility bill)

It is the opposite: deflationary. There is not enough money in trading to satisfy the demand at the current price, so the trading price goes up.

You always have a tradeoff between freedom and security.
It is much less convenient to make bitcoin payments anonymous through mixing services and decentralized through direct trade.
You have to differentiate between the bitcoin protocol and it's current implementation - not only software (contracts, scripting) but sociologically and economically
IMHO exchanges e.g. are just something that is brought over from the traditional Forex trading because it is convenient. But it is not needed by the bitcoin protocol. If we find a better (read: more convenient for our purposes) way to trade, exchanges will extinct.

No, it drives the creation of a bubble. If spending stops, merchants will collapse and take the currency down with them.
Saving isn't bad. But please keep in mind if you believe in bitcoin to succeed as a currency, use it whenever possible, at least for smaller expenses. The value you lose when the price goes up afterwards is only created because money was spent.
It is indeed a prisoners dilemma.
