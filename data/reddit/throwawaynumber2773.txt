When I synced, I had problems with peers taking forever to send me blocks. My raspberry Pi also was at 20% CPU at that time. I also has network problems at the beginning that I solved after some time. So it might be that you are connected to slow peers or you have something like firewall problems.

I agree with the points you made. I for one referred to the fact that there is just the bitcoin client, and everything that gives bitcoin and its network value are we humans.
The antifragility stems from the economic rules of the system and the fact that the participants in the system, developers and users, make the whole ecosystem stronger by continuously implementing improvements and using our economic and social power to resist attacks and grow from it.

At these low amounts you can just leave your coins at the exchange until you have a couple of hundreds worth. Then move them as a whole to your own wallet. Also, don't listen to that guy. A few hundreds could be a few thousands (or a few tens) in a some years. Definitely worth the time.

It has already been mentioned but bitcoin in channels are more liquid and more usable bitcoin. 
Regarding hubs: as long as they don't have real power, it's irrelevant that there are hubs. If hubs would censor transactions or users, they would simply connect to some other peer to join the lightning network. That said, it's probably too early to draw conclusions about hubs. At the moment, the ln wallets build a channel to some specific default ln nodes. This doesn't have to stay that way at some later stage.

One remark: On an exchange you have counter party risk. On your computer you can lose the coins if the computer is compromised (for escape by a virus without you knowing it).

1. The devs don't decide, the community consensus decides. And the community consensus was Segwit + small blocks. 
2. Bitcoin needs fees in the long term for security because the block subsidy gets cut in half every four years.
3. Big blocks lead to centralization due to multiple technical and more importantly economic reasons (which I won't repeat in this post).
4. If you want lower fees in the long term, we will be able to use the Lightning network in combination with new tech like channel factories, multiparty channels, Schnorr signatures, and many more.
5. There is no free lunch. If someone claims to have a crypto currency that is faster, cheaper, and has the same security, decentralization, and resilience w.r.t. black swan events as Bitcoin, then this person is a technical illiterate or lying. There are fundamental tradeoffs which are not always obvious but hold true for every crypto currency/network.

There is no voting. The only one who counts is who buys the bitcoin from the miners, i.e. people represents by economic full nodes. You as the miner can fork whatever you want, you can't force people to buy the coins you mine if you are on the wrong chain, and it does not matter one bit what you signal. Case in point:
The success of the uasf and the failed segwit2x.

It's more than that. It's not simply that they don't want to acknowledge other peoples' success, it's that - in this case - the success of Bitcoin is challenging their belief system and their perceived reality. It's completely understandable that they reject it (at least initially). That does not make them awful people in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:27:56
Yeah, but that's a fever dream. Every miner has a different profitability threshold anyway (because of different hardware), so the difficulty adjusts before every miner is gone. Also, this dream assumes that miners don't have anything to lose, however, there are probably many miners that have Bitcoin and if they leave, they lose value. The game is not only about the new Bitcoins that are created but also about the old ones. I don't even want to start about the risk involved with failing Bitcoin.

- being online all the time (unless you want to hand over your keys)
You don't need to.
- finding optimum paths (and not going always through big hubs), since it's an NP complete problem and the network can be constantly shifting
Only if negative fees are concerned. Also, you don't need an optimal path, you only need a good path. Especially in shifting networks, you will never even try to find an optimal path. Optimal paths are strawmans.
- being able to cash in/out if fees get high again
Channel factories and other solutions.


Also an interesting approach, only problem is that afaik all pegging solutions so far are flawed (discussed in one of the later blockdigest streams).

Bitcoin is obviously different, in that its high price and associated high production cost are due solely to the possibility that it will, at some future time, be widely used as a medium of exchange. I think that the probability of this possibility is close to zero and therefore that the price of a Bitcoin will eventually drop to near zero, but at the same time I think that the blockchain idea is brilliant.

One of the few occasions I disagree. It's well known that Coinbase and Brian Armstrong are bad actors in the bitcoin space.

1. Is invalid since you have price movements anyway whether you use lightning per not.

If I recall correctly, Byteball is proof of work because you have to perform PoW to confirm earlier transactions in order for your transaction to be valid in the DAG. The difference to Bitcoin is that you do PoW yourself instead of the miners and this proof of work is small. (However, the total PoW increases linearly with the number of transactions, so the total PoW can be larger or smaller compared to that of Bitcoin.)
There will never be a CC that has no Proof of X system. Simple "voting" algorithms don't work because of Sybil attacks.

The question is whether KYC applies in cases you are unable to run with the money that is routed through your node. If in such cases KYC does not apply, then Coinbase could be a lightning network hub without any issue since intermediary nodes can only take funds from the incoming channel if they relay them to the outgoing channel. Never can they run with the incoming funds.
That said, Coinbase is a shitshow and I still hope they go under.

If you have an android phone, the easiest way is:
- use the samourai wallet to create a new segwit wallet and write down the seed. The seed is the paper wallet. 
- send the bitcoins to this wallet
- delete the wallet from the phone
- give the paper with the seed to your husband
Done. 
Ps: make sure to create a non bech32 segwit wallet. Iirc Coinbase does currently not support sending to bech32 wallets yet. A non bech32 address starts with a 3. Don't worry, there is no risk involved of losing the money even if you accidentally create a bech32 one.

The security guarantees get weaker with larger blocks. I cannot run my own validating node with 500MB blocks. So, whatever we do, we get weaker security guarantees anyway. In this case, I would even prefer side chains to facilitate the lightning network because I can choose to store only a small amount in LN channels while most of my bitcoin are safe on the main chain without side chain exposure.

Untrue. You can always squeeze a few % of efficiency by making a computer that is optimized for one kind of algorithm.

A full node protects you personally from following a "wrong" fork. By running and using your node, you can decide which side of a fork you give economic value. It's not necessarily super important from a tech perspective but from a social and economic one. Full nodes are part of bitcoins economic game theory.
If there are no full nodes then it is incredibly easy for miners to change the protocol like increasing the block size or even increase the max amount of Bitcoin. 
If there were no full nodes then segwit 2x would have succeeded. Our even more likely, bitcoin would look like bitcoin cash today. If miners on the bitcoin network decided to simply increase the block size and start mining it on the current difficulty while the economic full nodes reject their blocks, then they would lose a huge amount of money. 
Bitcoin was always about being your own bank and having full control over your money.  Only your own node protects these privilegeds and by proxy even protects everyone else.

@_date: 2018-04-27 17:51:19
Even that does not proof something is Bitcoin. The accumulated proof of work does not matter if you don't have consensus. If 99% of the miners decide to mine some Bitcoin fork for 20 years, but 99% of the users reject their blocks, then it is not Bitcoin but some irrelevant circle jerk. I can imagine a scenario where a larger mining corporation or even the majority of the miners mine a fork in a gamble while losing money doing it. Ultimately, hash rate and accumulated proof of work follows the market but do you want to imply that during that time the fork is Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:35:17


Not necessarily. You have to time the few days where bitcoin has its greatest gains during the year, otherwise you are better off holding. See fundstrat's analysis. It doesn't matter if you are right the other 99 times.

@_date: 2018-04-23 18:28:45
I agree with TheGreatMuffin, a simple database is enough. In order to prove that the database was not tampered with it is sufficient to put timestamped hashes of the data onto the Bitcoin blockchain. But you don't need to put all data itself onto it. Also, immutability is only achieved when there is large proof of work. Not even the Bcash blockchain is immutable due to its small hash power. A blockchain for such a tiny use case won't be immutable. Also, private blockchains are not immutable because they are preserved by the very entity you might not want to trust.

Nothing but it doesn't make economic sense to have two underlying network because of the network effect. One big network is much more secure than two smaller ones combined. Therefore, value and customers tend to concentrate onto one network. 
That does not mean that the other network will simply die. There will always be enthusiasts and fans of the other network keeping it alive but it will be very small and won't have much economic impact. Also, as long as cryptocurrency itself is very niche, this process will take a while to manifest.

Besides them attacking bitcoin in every way they can without outright banning it from the exchange (Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, Segwit2x, Bcash, etc.), they also do things like buying the company neutrino which employ people responsible for journalists being killed. 
(see e.g. 
One reason to buy the company was for chain analysis. Since coinbase knows the origin of your coins if you buy them there, you personally also lose a lot of privacy to coinbase if you don't employ measures like Wasabi and coin control. 
That's it for now, I probably didn't mention like 80% of the reasons why coinbase is a PoS company.

That's not how XRP works. These nodes might just be the centralized UNL itself, it wouldn't make a difference.
Also, the security assumptions of Liquid are precisely so that you don't need additionally trust as you already have into the exchanges you use. That's the whole point. Liquid is not a trustless bitcoin scaling method. It is a trading vehicle. Your strawman with XRP doesn't change that.
