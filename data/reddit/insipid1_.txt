The Pierre dude was clearly NOT talking about the ledger, but rather the TECHNOLOGY. He somehow thinks that because they've "survived" coordinated attacks that means they are "here to stay" which he confuses with immutable.
Claiming the ledger is immutable is as obvious as me claiming the sky is most of the time blue, why bother?

The public wants stable investments. Unless crypto finds a way to be STABLE +/- ~10% a year then the general population WILL NOT use it.
You talk about betting and gambling like the average person partakes in those ventures...they DO NOT.
Once crypto is nice and regulated, and the fraudsters aren't running off with peoples money, we can talk about the general public investing in crypto again.

I'm talking about the technological cost of the memory function. It will implode the network.
There's no way that bloat will combat the efficiency of QCs.

You too!

Just because some people are turning a profit (remember, that means others are LOSING their money) doesn't mean something is "real".
I have the vision to see that a digital asset has "some" value, but not the absurd value that's attached to it today. We will witness the decline and ultimate failure of just about every crypto asset that currently exists today. Mark my words.

Your math is absolutely hilarious at best, and delusional at worst. No government entity has any reason to let a cryptocurrency exist outside of using it to extract money from the general population, which is what they will do in SPADES right before they ban it.

Congratulations on collecting your profits good sir, you are stronger than all the hodlers who gave up multi-thousand percent returns.

My buddy works at a financial institution. Old people with dementia and alzheimer's call asking how they can invest in the bitcoins. Just because grammy doesn't know how to do it, doesn't mean her grandson, or financial guru doesn't, jackass.
Thus, if you think an ENORMOUS amount of public money wasn't just dumped into bitcoin you are absolutely delusional.
Also, making a BTC wallet and transferring funds does not make one smart. Saying it's "beyond the competency" is to presume you're somehow above others? I assure you, you are not.

Of course the average person has gambled at some point in their lives, but to gamble in crypto land means to do it every minute, of every day. THAT is not something people are interested in.
Ultimately people who aren't buying services with crypto have no use for it outside of a speculative vehicle, thus they will NOT find a "different" use for one, as if you're not buying something with it (why would you? - the technology is crap) then what use do you have for some data sitting on a flash drive?
Torrents have been damaged by hosting providers shutting them down repeatedly. This has caused extreme damage to the propagation of torrents, and has resulted in them being niche. Exactly the same thing will happen to crypto.
Again, of course fraud exists in other currencies and life situations, but in crypto it is the NORM. The entire crypto land is based on a propped up price point manipulated by a few people. Tethers anyone? Bitconnect pyramid scheme anyone? You can't have this level of wash trading, pump and dump schemes, lies, and deceit and expect to keep regular people around. The media hasn't even caught up to this stuff yet, wait until they do.
Your arguments are literally pointless.

The public (and their money) won't go crazy for crypto again. It happens once, results in a bubble that pops (we've already seen this) and then the price drops.
The mem poop decreasing will be highly correlated with the ensuing price drop of bitcoin to sub $1000 levels.

It happened all these times WITHOUT public money. Now that public money was dumped in, and the wealth was extracted from those people, they won't invest again.
Not to mention the boredom and fear of it. You can't go to sleep, let alone take a shit without worrying about your investment is collapsing, and you being unable to do anything about it. To make matters worse you're most likely losing your money to pump and dump schemes, fraudsters, whales, and market movers. How is the little guy supposed to feel good about that?
Who wants to live a life like that? Nobody.

Except that's definitely NOT true. Apply and MS are legitimate companies with revenue, debt, profits, earnings, reports, dividends, shareholder responsibility, and so much more.
Bitcoin is this:
A propped up, fake "asset" that has been pumped to the moon by bad actors, bots, and pump and dump schemes.
Nobody that owns a Bitcoin owns anything other than the ability to sell it to someone else. When you own shares in a legitimate company you are a part of something REAL.

They've transferred their wealth to someone else, and they won't get it back. The same will be said of everyone else holding over $3000, which is likely where this thing is going to correct to this year.

Yea, the leader/head can be a group of people. In this case it's all the people who bought in early, and mainly the ones who created their respective coins.

LMAO, that's all you've got? How about FACTS. You can't handle them, you live in a dream world.

Bitcoin will die (along with all cryptocurrency, until new algorithms are invented) when quantum computers are deployed.
The entire foundation of bitcoin is classical by nature, and utilizes mathematics that is over a thousand years old.
The currency will not recover when a QC is deployed against the hodlers of bitcoin. It is imperative to cash out prior to this time, which will happen within the next decade or so.

And the cost of the memory function is what exactly? Not sustainable for the future of a cryptocurrency.
Public ledgers will be the most targeted and attack piece of information to EVER exist if they gather steam, even if only by the man behind the curtain.

It has only happened once, but if you think it's happened 4 times there is no helping you.

This is possible the BEST thing about this crash...

There's nothing to HODL. Crypto is a massive ponzi scheme that's going to come CRASHING down very, very soon.
