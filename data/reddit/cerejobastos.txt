Do you guys thikn a democrat would be good for Bitcoin?

Stop buying! Let it drop a bit more �� else I cant afford it
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:31:00
Those 0.003..... will be worth more than a whole bitcoin nowadays. Fingers crossed ��
@_date: 2019-10-15 12:21:15
Yes, people should worry and take some measures, else it might actually happen in time.
Noone knows what they might be planning.
Still very improbable and hard tho but better safe than sorry.
@_date: 2019-08-29 08:34:34
Doubt we get below 7500 ish, but would actually be good since I am getting my hands on more shitcoin usd to buy more soon
@_date: 2019-10-09 07:55:59
What a fucking nonsense
@_date: 2019-10-08 09:39:50
Cannot answer you that question properly, but that was the case I dont think they would even consider confidential transactions.
Gotta do some research myself too.
@_date: 2019-10-08 09:10:04
Cannot find it atm as he has a ton of videos but a simple google search finda you many articles about it.
The point is, input and output values are private to everyone except the 2 (or more) parties involved, so the network can validate the tx.
@_date: 2019-08-23 19:27:01
Spot copying my typos, you bastard! ��
@_date: 2019-10-08 07:54:02
Confidential transactiona do not mess at all with the ability to check the 21 million cap.
Also, privacy must be built on L1, not any other layer or it will fail.

Not saying it is cheap, because it isnt. Just saying that I never payed wired fees

Firmware could be leaking my priv keys right?
@_date: 2019-10-02 07:22:08
Why is non-native transaction bigger? Due to the script that simulates segwit or something?
Trying to learn more.

If people stop using it solves another problem then
@_date: 2019-10-01 09:20:50
Noone stopped mining.
Blocks take an average of 10 mins between each other.
But it is an average, yesterday what happened was that there was almost 2h between 2 blocks but then you had a bunch of them in a few minutes.
In the end it
 will always average at 10 minutes per block.
@_date: 2019-10-06 22:26:15
You are still trusting a third party. If it was open source you wouldnt have to
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:17:30
Central banks would never risk destroying their currency just to try to kill Bitcoin.
First, even if they managed to buy all Bitcoin, who are they? There are various central banks in the world and they wont ever be friendly to eachother, specially when they have ruined all their fiat currencies and now have to stick to Bitcoin.
It would change nothing but the currency they will be using.
Now it is an harder game, either they fork it to each their own version of Bitcoin or they will destryo each other trying to accumulate it all, because it kinda becomes a zero sum game at that point.
Another point is, a single government cannot coordinate itself at such a large scale, how do you expect several ones to do so?
@_date: 2019-08-29 12:21:49
You dont need to be an expert to realize that ripple is a scam, security or not.
@_date: 2019-10-10 08:43:05
That is retarded. That tends to 0. Could have given it a bit more effort.
Btw, remember to stack sats guys.
@_date: 2019-10-12 09:06:58
We dont need any tech giant to come out first, people will understand in time.
In fact it would probably be worse for Bitcoin and their idea is much simpler to implement and they already have thr "workforce".  People wouldnt change to Bitcoin after using Libra because it is so much simpler and easier to use and understand.
People here saying libra is good are in Bitcoin just for the money they can probably make.
@_date: 2019-10-03 21:16:08
"Bitcoin has gotten too popular"
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:30:11
What makes you feel more confortable? Do that.
Probably wont matter long term.
@_date: 2019-10-08 10:41:02
The network is able to validatr that input value == output value.

Andreas M. Antonopoulos Transcript
Bitcoin Energy use is damaging the Climate ??
Andreas. . . So, I think this premise misunderstands both the function and the operation of the system.
For one thing there is a vast difference between energy production and energy consumption.
The idea that energy consumption is damaging to the climate is not accurate from a scientific perspective.
If you use a solar panel to consume the energy of the Sun that is already hitting almost every square centimetre of the surface of this planet, which is an ominous amount of energy that goes unrehearsed, that doesn't damage climate.
In fact if you use the energy from a solar panel, or from geothermal energy, from wind or from hydro energy and you use that to mine Bitcoin what it does is, allows you to create a smoother return on investment on the infrastructure that you invested in Alternative Energy (AE). Which increases the investment in AE thereby decreasing the economic cost of for example, solar panels, wind turbines and so forth while further increasing that infrastructure build.
Because Bitcoin is location independent;
* It doesn't have to be near population centres that product the most carbon dioxide,
* It doesn't have to be connected to traditional or classical, hydrocarbon based energy.
In fact it's connected to the least expensive and the least transportable, generally that is AE, that is produced at a time of least demand (usually waste energy) and/or produced to far from locations of demand due to lack of distribution networks.
From an economic perspective therefore Bitcoin stimulates the development of AE the way no other system does, and at the same time people that make this argument fail to see that economic activity in itself requires a system of value and payments,
traditional we do that with two infrastructures;
* We do it with cash, it costs Billions of dollars to print, destroy, circulate, clean, remove, transport physical cash from place to place.
* Also digitally in the centres of Banks and Credit Cards those take enormous amounts of energy to house employees who work on the systems, the computer systems themselves, fraud checking. (process and systems that are replaced by Bitcoin)
So we've got to look at what this replaces, it replaces something that is already very very energy intensive, but that energy use is hidden, and it replaces it from energy intensive hidden energy use that happens in the centre of our cites where it produces the great carbon dioxide footprint and it removes it to the most remote areas and to the most alternative and renewable forms of energy.
In the end this is a more environmentally friendly technology than our traditional payments.
Once you understand it from that perspective this should be the choice of environmentalists.

In Confidential transactions you cannot see the amounts, but you know the inputs are equal to the outputs.
@_date: 2019-10-10 16:15:33
Dont use Coinbase.
Easy fix.

What if I need food?
Starve to death?

Firmware could be leaking my priv keys right?
@_date: 2019-10-12 08:24:30
Wrong, it would be worse that today's system.
Even more control by even fewer people.
And all world would have access? Gotta be kidding, laws wouldnt change, many countries like Iran and Venezuela for example would be left behind.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:13:11
For some very little percentage of the world.
Stop being selfish and think of the others.
Even in developed countries there ate thousands of peopme without access to banking due to stupid laws or the simple fact they were born in certain countries.

So I buy 10$ and it goes down 20%.
Then I sell 1$ and it goes up 4000%.
Profit: 390$.
@_date: 2019-10-08 12:48:30
And risk ruining the world justvto kill bitcoin? Ye right
@_date: 2019-10-08 09:59:29
True, but the network is able to validate that the inputs equal the outputs, so how is that related to inflation bug?
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:09:23
Too popular, right...
Like 99,999% of the world knows and understands Bitcoin and it cant go up because there are no more people to buy it from here on so the price can only go down. Sell everything. The scam is over.
Good post man.

Might have been my misunderstanding then.
Edit: avoid Coinbase indeed.

Since you have helped the world so much, how can I help you instead this time?
@_date: 2019-10-12 09:03:56
Healthy ���� ffs how can one vouch for Bitcoin and say Libra is healthy?
It might have been a good idea if it wasnt put in practice by people who couldnt care less about anything other than power.
Fuck facebook and fuck libra.
@_date: 2019-10-06 12:03:20
Should one use coldcard instead?

LN is not some dumb corporate software that noone really cares if it works as intended or not, and still takes years to develop.
LN is being developed to become the world standard, so shhshh about your nonsense bullshit.

Mt best is 17 per hour
@_date: 2019-09-17 09:38:05
But I mean solely on Bitcoin. I have a ledger but I dont like the fact that they also support like 30 pther useless coins. Just that.
@_date: 2019-09-28 10:57:23
Since there already are some, like CME, which supposedly is manipulating the price, having a couple more (even is cash settled) could be beneficial if they arent pushing the same agenda as CME. Otherwise it can become even worse if the manipulation is true.
@_date: 2019-09-17 10:36:06
People complaining that I complain about altcoin support are just clueless.
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:29:47
7500 is the bottom

Does this include non-native segwit too?
@_date: 2019-09-23 09:46:48
Not much volume but perhaps volume that wouldnt enter the market any other way.
@_date: 2019-09-17 10:37:56
Time and resources wasted on useless coins that will probably be dead in a few years.
I want to support whoever supports Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-25 21:14:37
Why do you say that?
@_date: 2019-09-12 09:00:20
That is bullshit. People can send billions for like 20$ of fees. And slow? Hashrate has been increasing like hell lately.
@_date: 2019-09-16 13:03:30
Don't use coinbase

(if alive) Satoshi know the importance of Bitcoin and lack of inherent value of any fiat currency, I dont expect him to move any coins before and if Bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency.
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:57:56
You do realize that 50k x 21million is only 1$ trillion. That is nothing in today's world.
