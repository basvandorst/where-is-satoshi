Most secure is stored on a device that's not connected to the internet (or any network for that matter)
This can get costly so you have to decide when you have enough btc that you'd be concerned about getting stolen Vs the initial costs of a hardware wallet or another computer not connected to any networks.

Maybe in comparison to certain other alts, but not bitcoin. When bcash was first spawned I think it was trading for around $500. Keep in mind bitcoin was still below or around $4000 at the time. Now bcash is even lower than that, and bitcoin is over 12k. It had its lowest ratio to btc price last December and is almost that low again now.
For comparison, Litecoin around that time was like $50 and is now about 3x that, monero was around 50 and is now 2x.

Your seed should be written down (on paper) and only used in emergency to recover your wallet if you forget your password or your hard drive crashes.
A good hardware wallet will cost you around fifty bucks, so you have to decide when it will be worth the extra money for the peace of mind of not getting hacked.
Keep in mind, even if you don't invest more, that $250 could be a thousand dollars or more in a few short months.

Doesn't coinbase require 3 or 6 confirmations?
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:27:57
It's fiction bro

That's half the strategy, the other half is just tricking newbs that stumble into and onto bitcoin.com
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:52:24
Let me guess, you got duped into buying bcash on bitcoin.com
This is why everyone hates bcash, it's scammy trickster bullshit

I woild just keep it on coinbase until you have a sizeable amount. As long as you secure your account w 2fa it's arguably safer than transferring to a wallet on your pc and malware stealing your btc

Two I've seen are  and blockfi but blockfi has a higher minimum than you have. Look around and compare, I think there are a handful of them that have sprouted lately. On nexo, you could have 600 bucks right now then buy your btc back when you're able to with an 8% apr. Better than 25-30% credit card apr certainly.
You get your bitcoin back when the loan is paid off regardless of bitcoin price

You've got malware friendo. Download malware bytes and scan. Be careful accessing any wallets before fixing and invest in a hardware wallet while you're at it

I would cash out a portion for a down payment and sit on the rest. If btc goes to 100k+ you'll be sorry
@_date: 2019-08-06 20:40:23
You could use one of those new bitcoin as collateral loan companies to pay off your credit card debt, that way you can buy back your bitcoin at a much lower interest rate than your credit card apr. You get rid of the credit card debt and keep your bitcoin. Also it's tax free

There are recommended wallets on bitcoin.org
If you have any substantial amount, you should invest in a hardware wallet (ledger or trezor) or use an always-offline computer with electrum
If someone hacks into your coinbase account then you're screwed. As value goes up, there will be increased hacking attempts

The main issue is that he controls bitcoin.com and and uses them both to confuse and trick newcomers into buying bitcoin cash. If it weren't for those two things, no one would really care about him or bitcoin cash in general

Check the user agreement then, but I've seriously had coin on it for years in the past and nothing like that. Could be that someone has a trojan on your pc and is trying to get you to log in for them so they can steal your funds that way

Just the initial payment really unless you have a data cap from your isp. It doesn't require much electricity but will use up a decent amount of bandwidth

Swap your coins to coinbase pro and they will cover the transfer fee unless that's changed in the last year.
