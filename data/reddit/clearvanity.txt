Fucker your post history goes back 2 years and one of the first things you commented back then was


What kind of level of insecurity does it take to stay on your high horse for two years and talk down to people in this community. Did your dad beat you and your mother when you were young?

Always move your btc out of the exchanges

CUSTOMER is king. Sure it doesn't adhere to our BTC cult standards but it allows people like us to spend BTC the we way want to (take advantage of anonymity etc.) and gives the mom&amp;pop stores another stream of revenue. Win win but yeah one step at a time.

How would the mom and pop store collect payment? If that's your question then:
From what I've seen with sites that accept bitcoin: They never actually touch the BTC. It goes to a 3rd party providing the "accept bitcoin" service and they "instantly" convert it to fiat and then send it to the mom and pop store. :)

Probably a QR code representing an amount+address.

What are you looking for? Any bitcoin application can generate a QR code nowadays

That's just the official term for it. Does Google make you uncomfortable? Its a term used everywhere and heavily in the crypto world because "USD or whatever" doesn't always apply. Sometimes you need a universal word for it. Its like saying car instead of BMW, Ford or Audi...
