Enlighten us, oh great one.

Eons ago, gold was discovered. It was rare. It was hard to acquire. It was fashioned into decorative and aesthetic pieces of art and jewelry. That is the origin of it's value. Do you not agree? This concept has not waivered.

I'm trying to get people to realize for themselves, without telling them, that this isn't gold vs bitcoin. Those ideas are small potatoes. And even if you may disagree, one is most robust while the other has greater chance for returns. Don't let those returns blind the stability of physical assets like land and precious metals. Everything, except central bank tender, has it's place.

I was waiting for you. I agree, but that's not the point.

Gold can be used in physical assets. It is the most malleable and ductile metal in existence. It is shiny. People like jewelry. People like electronics. Bitcoin is wonderful, but doesn't it need to be transacted to hold up it's value, at which point it is a medium of exchange more than a store of value? What will it's use be when alts are slowly decoupled from BTC, in terms of a store of value? I am not trolling, and open to discussion.

And you followed me over here. It's not the other way around.

I'm surprised more people here don't like gold and silver. How does the phrase go? "We're allies because we have a common enemy." Something to that effect. You take it too personal, bud. Lighten up a little.

Not with that post history. Looks like you bought at the top. Sorry fella. I can hear you now, "I won't get dumped on next time."

Ok, I wasn't expecting an aggitated response. You're analogy is a bit empty. I thought I asked legitimate questions on the nature of the cliche words 'store of value', and I got no answers. 90%? Any source on that? I hold BTC and gold, by the way.
