I'm pretty sure that if your account is frozen on CB they don't just take your money, they let you move it before they close the account

Yeah I keep all my BTC on coinbase. I'm think about posting this to and asking them what's up
@_date: 2015-12-03 20:57:19
It does mean he has an emotional, intellectual and probably financial investment in it though. Clearly enough reason to at least be suspicious of a conflict of interest
@_date: 2015-12-20 15:27:33
No, coinbase lets you withdraw your coins before shutting it down completely. They're not trying to steal your shit

Centralization shill? How odd... Also check again buddy, ghash is losing it's stranglehold. The people have spoken  
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:04:14
"It's in their best interest to retain trust"- I think this is the problem right here. It shouldn't be a matter of trust, isn't that the whole point? People are upset because it's gotten to a point where we have to consider the trustworthiness of one organization when talking about the system as a whole. Sounds an awful lot like centralization 
@_date: 2014-06-07 05:20:57

@_date: 2014-10-14 16:53:54
You answered the question yourself, you're just having a hard time extrapolating from countries to individuals. BTC is a decentralized fiat, you're talking about centralized fiat. Same idea just backed by collective individuals instead of countries 
@_date: 2014-10-14 19:30:45
I'm pretty sure its not statutorily required to use US dollars in the US. So you're saying its illegal for someone to sell something without accepting US dollars as payment? So no bartering or trading of favors or using of other currencies? Think about that for a second
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:38:21
Sure but that's a stupid thing to say. It's like saying that destroying the world will solve all humankinds problems 
@_date: 2016-03-23 13:17:21
Are you for real? What happens when there is more CO2 than the plants can handle? What if we're dumping it into the atmosphere faster than its being taken out? Consider that along with record breaking deforestation efforts across the world and the death of our oceans. Saying 'plants use CO2' is something you should learn in 9th grade bio, hell I taught a class of 5th graders about photosynthesis just last semester. There's a lot more too it than carbon sequestration from plant life

A fork is worthless if miners and others don't use it. Just because it easy to write some codes doesn't mean its easy to actually implement it in a meaningful way.
My problem with calling a modification to Bitcoin an 'altcoin' is that its completely arbitrary. Are we running exactly the same Bitcoin code as when it came out? No, so then the BTC right now is an altcoin. Thats just as valid a statement that Classic is an altcoin using your logic
@_date: 2016-06-10 14:49:11
The volume discrepancy could be described by a number of other things. Theres much less friction between btc/fiat in China than in the West (fees maybe) or they Chinese coins just aren't being sold immediately. We've been in a bull run so it follows some people would hodl instead of just cashing out immediately

If Blockstream is taking money from VCs, I would be worried about their interests aligning with that of the VC whom they now owe money to

Yea dude, Venezuela is socialist and North Korea is a democratic republic, just like they say they are
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:01:05
And DPRK has 'elections' so how is it not democratic?

Get off reddit Yellen!
@_date: 2016-02-18 15:41:52
Thanks for the serious response.... 
I want to take a moment to reiterate that, I'm not a socialist myself but I do take qualm at you saying that socialism is categorically bad. Your sources are convincing that price inefficiency is an issue, but I never said socialism was perfect or even great. I just said it wasn't horrible. Each system has its pros and its cons, and I feel its lazy to just generalize






So if I made the argument that capitalist systems ALSO have inefficiencies that can rival that of socialism, what would you response be? Hopefully you agree that pollution is a negative externality and is not being properly accounted for (well maybe, idk where you live). What if someone values not destroying the planet over greater economic growth? 
 
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:43:51
Yes but the guy above you is saying that Blockstream has too much control. Remember that $50million they got in VC funding a bit ago? Yeah I'm sure those VC capitalists just gave that money with no expectation of anything in return 
@_date: 2016-02-11 01:34:04
Not for the time being, any node running Classic won't differ from core until the 75% consensus kicks in 
@_date: 2016-02-11 01:35:49
Yeah, and who are the guys who gave $50million+ to Blockstream?
@_date: 2016-02-18 15:02:16


Could you link me to some economic papers where they discuss this? I'd like to read the source you're getting this from
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:48:13
What you mean like how Blockstream is guiding the development of BTC to use their side chain solutions which just so happen to be VERY profitable for the Blockstream peeps?
@_date: 2016-02-11 15:12:13
Could you explain to me how scaling isn't literally more tx/s? What else do you consider scaling of the BTC network?
More people using BTC is growth, the technical capacity to handle that growth is scaling. So what exactly do you consider scaling if not handling more transactions?
@_date: 2016-02-18 15:05:49


Yes, plenty of African countries (among others) demonstrate just that. Why do you think socialism is to blame?
@_date: 2016-02-12 01:01:55
Idk man even the Fed is contemplating NIRP. The dollar has never gone past 0 has it? Uncharted territory 
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:46:54
Yeah man I definitely trust the VC capitalists dumping millions of dollars into Blockstream
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:41:47
Simply because Venezuela is socialist doesn't mean that socialism is the reason its failing. That is a naive and intellectually dishonest train of thought.
You could make an equally compelling argument that cronyism and corruption is what is causing its downfall.

Uh there are many more cases where the anonymous drug dealer actually comes through. So again, you cannot apply stereotypes in every situation. You have to do more thinking than just defaulting to the easiest solution 
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:43:47
Sigh. You're still missing the point. I don't give a fuck what you think about Evo or Bitcoin. I'm saying that it is lazy, ignorant and just plain stupid to say something like 'all drug dealers are bad people'. What are you, a 4th grade DARE fanatic with no conceptualization of the real world?
@_date: 2015-03-11 03:00:01
Yeah assuming everything stays exactly as it is. Which is a pretty shitty assumption

How could someone benefit from keeping the price low? its been low for so long you'd think they would want the price to start moving a little
