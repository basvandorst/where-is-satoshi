I’m not a fan of Libra, but doesn’t VISA &amp; MC have that same data on all my CC transactions?

I’m surprised we don’t see any Pres candidates advocating for states’ rights.  It seems like the political class is consumed with federal government run programs implemented for the entire country.  Kind of the antithesis of what our founding fathers wanted.

fwiw, I always thought winning the lotto and investing it in crypto was the ultimate brass balls move.  Put the rest in ETH and your legend will live forever.

I’m not sure.  I think you might be underestimating the cognitive dissonance the masses are capable of.  Those that are introduced to “IdiotBitcoin” via MC, or another intermediary, likely will never know or care about the underlying asset.  Ultimately, that is what MC wants—people to be too ignorant of the tech to even know they can store themselves.

“Banks are dangerous and unreliable.  The established barter system is a pillar of our society.  Without it the feudal system we all rely on would collapse and serfs would have no market to trade their labor for a lifetime of field-based toiling.”  —ancestor of Janet Yellen

I like this graph.  Helped me realize that "Bitcoin" as a unit of measurement is more like how we say "a billion" dollars.  What I mean is, we never say .00001 billion we say "ten thousand dollars".  Soon we'll talk in Sat terms.  The question is, how soon?

Sorry, forgot what subreddit I was on.  Pretty cool to see the bitcoin maximalist in their native habitat though.

Good point.  It’s so easy to be at $15,000 and wish you wold have mortgaged your house to buy all you could at sub-$7k.  
It’s a whole different ballgame to have the stones to actually do it when given the chance.

With regard to ETH, this is shaping up to be an epic battle.  To me, it may not pass the Howey test but it’s also not exactly a security.  Despite the Ethereum Foundation’s ongoing work, the platform is still open source.  So, calling it a security immediately opens up some major questions as to governance moving forward.
It’s also a major inflection point re: innovation vs regulation.  Forget about the price/ETH for a second and consider the potential of the Ethereum platform itself.  The SEC’s ruling could set blockchain development back a decade.  They rule it a security and it could crush the entire ecosystem quickly.

In some ways, the more trust we have, the more we get ripped off.  Doctors and pharmacists are near the top yet healthcare and prescription drug costs have skyrocketed.

Not to be conspiracy guy, but the amount of $$$ that type of campaign would take is nothing for big banks who may be looking to buy up crypto.  They'd likely 10x any money they spent on the campaign in the 1-2 year timeframe.

It sounds like the plot for a horror movie.  
20 BTC is donated.  Transaction can’t be reversed.
BTC goes to, say, $15k in the next year.
Receiver goes insane wondering if someone is coming to take the $300k they gifted them.

Correct.  I'm thinking that, generally speaking, the older a person is the more they remember the feeling of coins jingling in their pocket.  They have many more memories of paying for items with physical dollars.  Heck, even the act of writing a check &amp; then balancing the checkbook has a more tactile feel to it.  That could be why it's hard for them to conceptualize a form of money that has no physical properties whatsoever.

Agreed on the CNBC crew with the exception of Joe.  I know it’s all about “playing to their base.”  Does that “bah Bitcoin, grumble grumble” rhetoric really resonate with their viewers?

Better at conceptualizing a virtual commodity.  They live  (or will live) more of their lives in the virtual world.  For example, to my 3 year old, “play a song” means touch a few sections of a glass screen on my iPhone.  Conversely, play a song to my generation involved physical objects like buttons, knobs, CDs, opening &amp; closing etc.
So the kids who are very young now will grow up to be more at ease with “things” that only exist in the virtual realm.

I like your point about "physical touch".  To that end, small kids (5 &amp; under) will probably understand Bitcoin more easily because they're growing up in a world where they physically handle money very rarely.  Very bullish social setting for crypto.

It's hard for me to put myself outside of the crypto space.  Why do non-crypto people get so caught up in arguing over the value of a USD vs. a bitcoin?  
Have they been programmed by the media to do this?  Is it holding on to something comfortable like the USD?  
It just seems like arguments of "why is 1 USD worth 1 USD" in relation to Bitcoin end up going around in circles.

Who is this woman?  I’ve seen her a couple of times.  She seems to have a way better knowledge level than most anchors who do crypto segments.

It’s not apples to apples though.  Bitcoin is more volatile.  Your facts aren’t wrong but it’s a arbitrary time scale.
Bitcoin was less than $1000 two years ago.  In 2 years it went up 4x.  The S&amp;P is up like 10% in that same timeframe.  The Dow is up roughly the same 10% or so.  Even if you rolled back to the recent highs for both, it still doesn’t compare to BTC today vs 2 years ago.
If you could go back to December 2016, which would you put your money in?

I respect what you are saying and I agree that dividend stocks are awesome.  It’s just that the stock market darlings of today don’t use this model.  The tech sector is notoriously smug about thinking they don’t need to pay dividends because people should just want to own their stock.
In a weird way, crypto might force companies to offer more attractive dividends as a way to differentiate between stock and crypto investments.
