They're traded like money the same way [tulips]( were traded like money -until they weren't. Without some sort of intrinsic value or backing by a company or economy, it's just a game of [Greater Fool](

Sure, when is the right time to exit for each scenario?

Came looking for people highly invested in Bitcoin talking other people into investing in Bitcoin despite this correction.
I'm never disappointed.
Guys, of course they're telling you to hold or invest. That's how they make money and leave you holding the hot potato. There's always a [Greater Fool]( until there isn't.

When is the right time to get out of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:48:40
No. When is the right time to *get out*? What economic indicators can I use to just when is the right time to sell Bitcoin?

Stocks represent ownership of a company, which is important because companies have assets and generate actual revenue.
Owning a piece of a crypto network doesn't mean anything because crypto networks have no value (besides the circular logic of "they provide crypto currency").
If you get out before the crash, more power to you.

I work in software and am well versed in the tech. The tech is neat. But lots of tech is neat -that doesn't make it a financial instrument.

You got out before they hit $0, so you're ahead of most of the people here.

Selling at 30c is better than selling at exactly 0. ��‍♂️

She'd also have to calculate capital gains taxes every time she bought something with it or exchanged it for another currency. The IRS wants their cut and if they find out you're not paying taxes on your BTC gains they will tear you a new asshole and then fuck you in it.

IRS considers cryptocurrencies to be intangible assets, like stock and other investments. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:40:36
It is, and you have to pay capital gains taxes on it every time you buy something with it or convert it to another currency. Else the IRS will obliterate you if they find out.

Serious response: It's not a scam, it just has slow growth compared to my other investments. I'm not interested in the culture/hobby around mining etc, and I didn't get in early so there is little appeal to me as an investor.
Combine this with Bitcoin driving all of its value through speculative hoarding rather than something with intrinsic value like real estate or stock... the risk profile doesn't justify it versus other types of investment.
That may all change in the future, but for now I'm satisfied with my position.

How do you spot a bubble?
\&gt;"Price is rising! Hold!"
\&gt;"Price dropped! Buy!"
When is the right time to *sell*? How do you know that there's still a greater fool waiting to buy you out?
If you can't articulate how you know when to get out of a market, you are just chasing a bubble.

Who sells bitcoins at a $9k loss?
People who don't want to sell at a $15k loss.
