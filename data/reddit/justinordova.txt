Not sure, I haven't used that one. The btc-paypal is instant so i guess the same goes for btc-skrill.

REMEMBER if you want to use it multiple times you need to change your PAYPAL and IP ADDRESS!

They want to use a blockchain and it the same time they want that blockchain to be centralized. 
They are basically missing the whole point of decentralization and bitcoin.

Hm. The company is real, you can check that by yourself with calling the UK's company registry.
As i read the user who made that post haven't used the service, he just gives his opinion and expect a tip to his address in return, I did the same - I gave my opinion and I shared my experience (and I do not expect a tip for that).
Anyway, there is no need to make decisions based on other posts. Why don't you try the service yourself with an amount that is acceptable for you? 0.01 btc? cheers
edit: The guy's post starts with **I copied this and I am just wondering if there is any truth to this.**, however the title of his post is "scam" and he asks for tips, I would clasify that one as an attention whore.

Company whois:






















They are registered in the the UK under number 9934709, which is a green flag.
Also their website is secured with PositiveSSL, which comes with a $10,000 warranty.
As a further measure, if you intend to trade 10 btc (for ex.), you can trade 0.1 btc first to see how it goes.
I have used it around 5 times so far and it went smooth (both paypal and bank)...
