Do you want a job? I will hire you to become a millionaire. All you have to do is buy as much bitcoin as you can with the money the CIA or FBI is paying you demote this post and promote this post everywhere you can instead. The only reason I cannot buy your bitcoin's for you is because on whatever website you keep them on is your responsibility. You can pick your own hours and you will have absolutely noone as your manager to keep you in check. The CIA could have paid you more money but they will be glad they didnt after you start working for me. What do you say?

What if EOS is the fastest blockchain but propaganda is keeping it known as “not really a blockchain” under a deal made by China America and the central bank?
