I didn't say it was hazy or unclear. In this case, "Bitcoin" clearly means for the person I was replying to the set of people who decided Segwit2x was not to proceed.

What is "Bitcoin" in this statement? Certainly not the miners, certainly not the users. Bitcoin isn't this nebulous, transcendent thing somehow outside of politics. It's a group of people that killed Segwit2x.

So... "the community" doesn't include 82% of the hashing power...?

This reminds me of Ethereum's computation marketplace.

You don't think Bitfinex is playing a role in the current rise?

They're probably salty about the voluntary Ethereum Classic fork.

AFAIK, it should be possible to do cross-chain transfers with Ethereum once this is in place. Can anyone confirm/deny this?

Ethereum's fees [are pennies right now]( There are wallets with default gas prices that are much higher than they need to be, so that's where a lot of the "high fee" memes are coming from.

The multisig makes me nervous, to be honest. If enough of the key holders are compromised, there goes everyone's BTC! :-/

Sure, if you want to pay $3 you can pay $3. Or you can pay about $0.10 and be included within around 33 seconds (2 blocks) on average.

Such FUD, much wow.
Don't waste your breath on me, I'm only interested in trolling right now. You're not going to convert me, and I'm not going to convert you.

Wow, someone's feeling nervous. Kekekeke...

Got it. Thanks for the clarification!
