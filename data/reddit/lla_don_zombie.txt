That’s my point. I guess I didn’t make it well. The other guy said if you don’t spend it or use it that bitcoin will have no utility. From what I’ve seen, holding value is the main utility right now. I don’t even know of any online or IRL vendors who want to, or do fuck with bitcoin volatility right now.

Deja entendu was my favorite album in high school.... 13 years ago.

We agree on all points.

There’s really not much utility now is there? Except hodl and moon lambos of course. I’m sure there are some countries with every day use, but I haven’t seen anything that takes bitcoin in my daily life for awhile.

I thought only mega-mines in remote Mongolia were practical now. I had no idea normal people were still mining.
Edit: should specify, bitcoin. I thought personal mining was just for altcoin now.

Have you ever heard the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise?

Yeah. I’m in the same boat. I find the tech and potential applications fascinating. I’m not really interested in an investment though. I can wait till you are ready Bitcoin.

If I understand this sub properly it’s lambos and grossly overpriced pizza.

That’s a weird way to say “spend every penny on bitcoin and hodl”. Is English your first language? /s
