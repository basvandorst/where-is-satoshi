If you're an American resident and you use an American bank, your financial history can be tracked. When you make gains, that additional income should be taxed.
The bottom line is that it all eventually leads to a bank under regulations unless you go fiat-free which you - currently - cannot do (i.e. live a regular life where your property, taxes, utilities, food, insurance, etc can all be paid by Bitcoin) and this presumes people want to use BTC as a currency rather than an asset. After all, if you used BTC yesterday as currency, you lost an additional 7%+ due to its gains from last night.
There's nothing to prosecute unless you break the law and you do this by avoiding paying taxes.
For the millions of people looking into Bitcoin, a lot of them use Coinbase and need this info.
I agree that if you want to actually own Bitcoin then you should buy it and move it to an offline wallet but you need that initial purchase and the fees vs. security on GDAX are pretty low (free, even, depending on the case).

I was going to write a whole post about it to be honest. I think it makes sense to HODL until the fork happens. Then watch BTC and B2X and be prepared for adjustments.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:53:53
The math they're doing is... is pre-fork BTC &gt; post-fork BTC + post-fork B2X. If they think that then it makes sense to sell since you'd have more money even with the coins.

That's exactly how it should work.


That by itself, no, but we don't need a correction - we already had one. I think the spike from $5500 to $6500+ was a short squeeze from Bitcoin Cash collapsing but not that it's coming back up, BTC is trending down.
Will it cause another major drop to $6k? I don't think so but I hope Bitcoin will work on its problems. When it's able to fully respond with solutions that'll result in faster processing with lower fees, then we'll skyrocket higher (since value has been created) and alt's like Bitcoin Cash will collapse.

But that's where the discussion is coming from - nobody is comparing Bitcoin to a wire, check, or using credit cards.


That's one of the major features of a currency. If you had a very reliable currency which you can send to others but the fees are 99% then nobody is going to use it. Having low fees is a massive benefit of using crypto over non-crypto. The general world that sends money to others don't care as much about decentralization. If anything, it's a concern due to lack of oversight and protection.
I'll tell you this: if BTC fees are $0.01 and the transactions are instant, this will disrupt multibillion dollar technologies - it's a big deal!
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:49:21
Correction is 10% drop. We already hit high $6800s which is that 10%. We're now creating a support level in high $6900s, low $7000s.

People sold and it went through various stops. Then people just sold at market and short sellers stepped up their game.
It's up $50 from the lows and it'll stabilize. It dropped $160 in 10 minutes which isn't much. We had a $600+ drop recently.
Having drops is good. It means there's a new base - which is higher than the previous base. Remember how that was $6800? Then $7200? Now it's $7400.
Hey, remember a week or two ago when we had problems going over $6000?

OP left his position early but I bet at the time, they thought they were doing the right thing.
In the same way that someone sold BCC at its high also thinking the same thing.
Both made the right call based on information at the time. In hindsight, OP could have made more money. I told him that, in hindsight, someone could have lost more money too. Downvoted because BCC? It's good advice to not worry about the past :]
I don't know where BCC will be in the future but I'm not aware of any crypto that's collapsed to $0 and it wouldn't be a proper comparison to compare it to Lehman Brothers or Enron which collapsed (i.e. selling would have been the right call, so don't beat yourself up over it).

Up to you - there are pros and cons for both sides.
I'm currently erring on the side of "this thing will go up" so I'd rather get BTC rather than getting the most optimal price.
I will say that, in general, I don't buy at the lowest number next to a round number. For instance, $6500. Why? Because if you're down there, it's not great. So, you can be greedy and maximize your profit by hoping the base will hold but if it doesn't, it'll go a lot lower.
What I do is if I think the fall is a head fake (quick dip) then I put in at $6501.18 or something odd like that. I check how many orders are ahead of me. Usually you see:
* $6500
* $6500.01
* $6500.02
* $6500.50
* $6501.00
You get the idea. You just want to be ahead of them so your order executes first. Same with selling. Instead of $6600, sell at $6597.47 or something like that. Considering it's unlikely that you have 1000 BTC, the loss of profit is minimal but you get that guaranteed execution with that profit.

It might have something to do with us being at $4600 a month ago and some people would want to take profits considering the uncertainty about the fork.
Once the fork is done, BTC should continue going up because:
* uncertainty will be gone, and
* B2X is unlikely going to become the dominant Bitcoin

Well, let's think about this. Very few people have actual gold. Plus, gold has very little intrinsic value in case of armageddon - water and food are a ton more important. Not too many people have cash. Vast majority of people living in civilized countries use credit cards... which won't work.
We also don't have enough food to last w/ electronics, such as ones that are needed for vehicles to operate, including food trucks.
So don't worry about Bitcoin if this happens. You have other more serious problems.

Exactly, long term that's the plan. If you don't have cash on hand and you're worried about losing that price then Coinbase is the way to go.
You just need to remember that you're losing 1.5% right off the bat. At current prices, Bitcoin has to drop $96.5 for it to be worth it.

This is all basic stock trading stuff so you can find all the relevant info on something like 
But, basically, whether stocks or currencies - the market place - you have buyers and sellers.
Let's say there isn't anyone there except me and you. I'm buying, you're selling. I'd like to pay $5, you want $10. Neither one of us is willing to budge. This means that the spread is $5 - the difference between the buy (bid) and the sell (ask) price.
Now let's say someone else pops up and offers $7.50. Now the spread is decreased to $2.50 - the difference between $10 and $7.50.
Now let's say the seller has 3 items they're selling for $10 and they say screw it, they need money, so they lower their price to $7.50. That other person now buys for $7.50 but the spread remains $2.50. Why? Because that's the difference between my $5 and their $7.50. Now let's say I don't budge and the seller lowers their price to $5. Now there's another sale, no buyers, and the seller has 1 more item.
Considering in a real market place you have tons of people buying and selling, you often have $0.01 - smallest unit of difference - in the spread. That's how the price moves. For instance, in the example above, the price went from $10 to $7.50 to $5 and that's how all this moves.
I don't recommend you spend a single penny until you know how this stuff works. You can very quickly lose money and you need to know why and how so you can learn a proper lesson before you put any money on the table.

Using your reasoning, there is no reason to own stocks like Google, Amazon, etc. Heck, I doubt [BRKA]( is going to double anytime soon because it's $280,170/share.
It doesn't mean you can't make money.
In addition, when BTC was $500/coin, it had less of a secure future than today.
That's what you get with risk. Want huge rewards? Play penny stocks. Your stock can go from $0.01 to $0.20. That's even higher growth than BTC! But... it's still a risky penny stock which, like some other cryptocurrencies, can self-destruct where you lose most of your money.
Due to how math and investments work, you can't go up 10x times every month without people cashing out. Bitcoin, like many other [so far] successful investments mature. This means you get a lower *percent* return but it's still pretty high with the benefit of being a lot more safer than what it used to be.

If BTC is anything is that buying a whole coin is a silly idea when you can buy fractions of a Bitcoin so small that it's worth less than a penny.
Whatever amount you have, whether 1 BTC, 2.58 BTC or 0.00228 BTC, you'll get the same number of B2X. Not dollar amount... but BTC amount, so, 1 B2X, 2.58 B2X, and 0.00228 B2X.

Whether Coinbase or GDAX, the time it takes you to move your money is the same. If you're in a real hurry - and you actually have some serious money to invest - then why not just wire it?
Coinbase fee is very high compared to GDAX. It's good to use Coinbase only if you're new to buying/selling/trading but if you can wait to watch a 5-minute video on YouTube and willing to save a ton of money in fees, you should always use GDAX for your transactions since it has the lowest fees.

Support levels always matter and they often come into play. I agree that you can blow through support levels but professional traders keep an eye on them and cover their positions around those levels. If it blows through then they reinforce their positions but they always matter.


That's exactly right. The trend now is upward and I think the trend will be upward as we get closer to the fork. Basically, there's demand to own BTC right now and the higher the cost of BTC, the more people will scramble to own it because if it goes up higher, they will own BTC per USD. This will be particularly apparent right before the fork.
After the fork? I expect people to sell both. I expect people to sell the "extra" BTC they bought just for the fork and sell B2X for profit. Prices will be crazy for the first few minutes, maybe even half an hour, but they'll stabilize and then you need to look at the trend.
I hope BTC consolidates in the $7k range before making it's push to $10k, especially as the ETF news pans out. Now whether that's going to be the current BTC or whether B2X takes over BTC, that's another question but the overall trend is:
* Bitcoin will go higher due to higher demand, wider acceptance, and increasing adoption by the investment community via ETFs and related vehicles, and
* It has the largest market share with Etherium treading water and no real competition

BTC is currently an asset and a currency. I use it as an asset only. How quickly can I sell BTC? Instantly - within a second. How quickly can I send it to someone? That's not something I care about.
Considering the price of BTC has generally been rising, you're typically losing money sending BTC to anyone.
I'm not worried about the flood of transactions. These happened during the early days of credit card processing. Do you know what happened? The network was changed to scale with the additional flood while creating billions of dollars of value. I'm not worried. Bitcoin is still in its infancy after all. It'll start being a currency once it's value as an asset stop bouncing up and down.
The way new assets work is you have speculation of future gains which drives up the price but also spreads information and gets adopted as a new standard. Then the higher prices are justified and often go up due to even greater adoption.
I think once the scaling problem is resolved, we'll be in 5-digit range but it won't be a stable currency until it stops going up or down any more than 1% on a daily basis.

These orders types of orders - and they often come in batches of a dozen or two - typically amount to $0.50.
They're trying to influence in a few ways:
* if the price doesn't move and the last transaction is a buy for any amount then then the 1-minute chart will be green. If it's a sell then it'll be red. There are bots that are programmed to sell if you get a certain percentage of red closing bars (since it can imply negative direction). You'll see similar bots on the other side too. I see these often in Ethereum but Bitcoin has these too particularly when volume is light because that's when it can make a difference.
* sometimes you don't have many buy orders where enough of these tiny amounts will push the bid/ask to the next value which in itself can begin a trigger mechanism.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:35:28
Good luck but I'm waiting for it to consolidate. I think the probability of it going lower at this range is larger than the probability of it continuing to go up. It's up 10% - it's a good gain but it won't be 15% considering its size. I think people will take profits. I don't think it'll crash but I'm hoping for a consolidation so it can have a nice strong run-up. I think it'll go to low $7k and, if it blows through that, there's support at $6,800. I don't see it going anywhere below that. If you're here for a while then hold :]
I think it'll make another ATH by the end of the month, certainly by the end of the year (presuming no bad news). $10k? I don't think so, unless CME news is awesome (but I have a feeling CME won't launch this year).

That goes for anything you're invested in :]
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:11:22
I saved this comment and I'll let you know.


I don't think you can. Anytime anything opens, expect hectic trading particularly considering this is a big deal.
I expect B2X to immediately go down due to profit-taking (since you're getting free money). How much? I don't know but it depends on its price. For instance, it's ~$1950 right now. Yesterday? It was $1200. Massive increase.
I'm hoping it'll stay above $2k but I think it'll double again before the fork to $4k presuming BTC stays high.
Now do the math and stop salivating...
* say you have 1 BTC in your account which is worth $7,500
* you now get 1 B2X which is worth $4,000
Your total investment went from $7,500 to $11,500 in a day. 53.33% gain. What are you going to do? Yeah, you're going to sell to lock in the profit. What'll you sell? B2X because that's the free money.
Ironically, this could cause BTC to skyrocket as a result, as a fake to make people think B2X is crashing and BTC will continue to be the true Bitcoin.
But then once B2X hits a floor (perhaps 25% loss?), people will begin to buy it. Why? B2X is now on sale! They'll sell BTC's spike and buy B2X at the bottom.
It'll go a few rounds doing this with smaller spikes either way until it finds a stable ground and I think it'll be about 10-15% lower than when it began for B2X.
Then the actual challenge begins of adoption and then you need to keep an eye on both.
Math is your friend here. Since B2X is going to be a lower dollar amount than BTC, you now need to look at percentage changes.
For instance, say BTC is $7500 and B2X $2500, that's a 3:1 relationship so if BTC goes up 10%, B2X needs to fall 3x as much for you to lose money (when both are converted to USD). What is this magic? Let's convert both to USD:
* 1 BTC @ $7500 went up 10% which is $750
* 1 B2X @ $2500 went down 30% which is the same $750
I.e. you'll make money in the short term. Long-term, I think one of them will be destroyed but I think this will take place over months.
Considering the amount invested in BTC, I think it'll win from a financial point of view but we'll see.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:23:42
The buyers of B2X are ones who want it to succeed or - more likely - ones who think B2X will spike enough for them to make a profit and get out.
Those are going to be the buyers. Since quite a bit of miners have agreed to this, there is a lot of money at stake so they'd want the price to not crash.
The market will eventually make up its mind but that's where your  buyers are going to come from.
However, just like an IPO, you have no history of any support levels for B2X so it can go from your $1000 to $50 or it can spike to $5000. BTC has a history of various support levels so its spike won't be as dramatic due to built-in support.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:10:54
You're incorrect and this never happens.
It's fair to say that $168 million dollars changed hands and that's it.
I have some BTC long but I also trade. I sometimes have half a dozen transactions per day which is a few hundred thousand dollars. Does that mean one person made a $200,000 investment? No. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:11:16


It's hard to value BTC. I think the value should continue going up as volume increases and the adoption spreads. BTC has one huge advantage - it's the market leader of all cryptocurrencies. If it continues to be the market leader, it'll benefit as the market grows larger. For instance, say there's yet another stupid coin on the market and new people buy into it. Let's say it begins to collapse. When people sell, what do you think they're going to buy? Yep, Bitcoin, the market leader. Let's say there's a problem with another cryptocurrency. Where are people going to move the money? Yep, Bitcoin, the market leader.


If you look at the chart, we mostly skipped the entire $6,000 range as far as any consolidation. I like the consolidation at the current prices since it builds a base. So, if we go up to $7k, next time we fall, it won't be to $5,500 - it'll be to $6,500. I'm perfectly fine with that. Higher highs and higher lows.
If we stick around here for a few days - give or take a few hundred - it'll give us a solid base from which to go back up. Look at the previous crashes - they hung around flat for a bit and then began to move higher and then skyrocketed again.
Presuming no disruptions or bad news, I think our next runup will hit $10k and "crash" to $7200. I'm perfectly happy with that.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:39:17


Yes but I live in the US so perhaps your country (presuming not US) might see it differently.
HOWEVER, you need to add up your total profit. For instance, say you made $100 in profit yesterday and you lost $100 today then you pay no taxes.
You pay taxes on NET profit through the end of the year. Note: this also counts any transaction fees. For instance, if you bought 1 BTC at $6500, sold it at $6600 then you earned $100 profit. However, if your order had a $10 fee then your profit is obviously $90 and that's what you pay taxes on.

Not literally at those prices though right? If you want to buy at $6500 then put an order in at $6502.16 or something like that - see what the other prices are.
Orders are executed chronologically so when you put your order in at that price, it's the last to be executed.
What does this mean? It means that if you want something around that price then you'll definitely get it while losing a small amount of profit. If you place it at $6500 and you're the last order to execute then when it executes, the price will fall below $6500, likely $6470 so you're immediately out at a loss with a sell wall building at $6500.
The only benefit of placing an order at $6500 is that it'll take a while before your order is executed so you have time to cancel it if you're seeing massive selling.
Just my $0.02.

That's why I don't freak out when the fork happens but it's important to keep an eye to see which one will be the clear winner. For instance, if B2X is skyrocketing then BTC should be falling and then you should rebalance.

Takes a while to confirm it - about 6 hours last time I moved Bitcoin. You don't need to do anything. You need Trezor plugged in only to send Bitcoin out or to generate a new key.

No I think the correction was us going from mid $4k to high $7k in one month. Cancellation of SegWit2x was a catalyst for the massive drop where people sold because they thought they were getting free coins which forced profit-takers to sell which forced new weak hands to sell which then got the attention of short sellers who spiked it down. That's when Bitcoin Cash woke up and got money from the SegWig2x cheerleaders which spiked up, moving money from BTC buyers but now that Bitcoin Cash is collapsing, money is flowing back to BTC. We're just having lower and lower spikes between the two which is why you see lower range in movement (ex: no $1k, 24-hour spikes on BTC/BCC).

I use Trezor and it's worth it.


I heard others using Nano S, you might want to look into that too.


Why memorize anything. Write it down and put it somewhere safe. Ironically, having something written down on a piece of paper is safer than storing it on your own computer. However, I use a safe since I treat my Trezor like a wad of cash. I wouldn't have that in a drawer.
That said, keep a backup of the keywords since that's how you can recover your account if your Trezor is destroyed.
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:41:03
Ah, thanks for clearing this up. You're right. In this situation, it makes sense to use Coinbase. However, you still run into purchase limits so there's only so much you can do.
Where your situation doesn't make sense is if the price goes down. Then you lose the money and you're still charged the high fee.
A lot depends on your outlook and what you want to do with Bitcoin. I trade Bitcoin so I already have money in Coinbase. If I want more money, I just send a wire transfer. I get access to thousands of dollars very quickly (not instant) for a very small fee.

Issue is that there's only one stable alt which is Etherium which just crashed and burned. So the other alt's are getting some traction. Problem is... none of them have any real market share so it's more like gambling, trying to catch those crazy gains. However, once Bitcoin stabilizes, the alt's will begin to fail as people flock back to the largest crypto around.

Considering the amount of money they're getting, I suggest they get the top 3 hardware wallets and get 3 copies of them. Then spread the money to the 9 wallets and keep that in a solid safe. I personally use Trezor with zero issues but why risk putting all your eggs in one basket, especially since we're talking about a quarter of a million dollars.
Treat it as cash. If someone gave you $250,000 in cash, what would you do with it? Put it all in one place? Heck, get a safety deposit box in a bank or two.

I thought I could sell at $6900 but I think it'll go a bit higher and I have sell orders prior to $7k. I'd be surprised if it went over that tonight. Hopefully settle back to $6,800 from there - old support. It can't go up forever - it needs a break. Next resistance is $7200 anyway and $7k is a juicy round number for people to sell at. A breather in the $6800s will rest us up to start going into mid $7k but this all depends on news. What news? CME futures will be the next catalyst to either side.
I'm glad you got in. I  just hate that I have to sleep since this would be interesting to watch. Just you wait, I'll get up tomorrow and it'll be $7300, lol.
It also decoupled from Bitcoin Cash as far as price. Its volume is slowing while BTC is rising. This means people on the sidelines are buying BTC in addition to those dumping BCC.
Again, I could be wrong so take it all with a grain of salt :]

I use Trezor. To set it up, you have a very long set of randomly generated keywords that you need to write down. You also set up a pin. If your Trezor is lost or broken, you can contact Trezor and re-create your entire wallet if you know the keywords and have the pin.
If someone steals your Trezor then that's the same thing as someone stealing your cash out of your wallet in the middle of the night. Let's say someone gave you $6500 in cash to store in your house. What would you do? Put it in a drawer? No you put it in a safe, a good safe. Why wouldn't you do the same thing with Bitcoin? Keep your hardware wallet in a safe.
I don't recommend you do anything on your phone because the market for someone stealing your phone is probably higher than the market for stealing your actual wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:20:50
Here's the problem... say BTC is at $7500 and B2X futures are at $2000.
What's stopping BTC from dropping to $5500, B2X opening at $2000, i.e. you get free coins but the overall value is the same... and then - due to panic - there's lots of selling where you basically lose 10-20% within minutes.
I'm nervous too and I'm planning some strategies.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:08:44




OK, so info on Trezor which is what I also use.
The little device? It's just a simple device. Can it connect to the Internet and tie into the blockchain? No. Why? It's a simple device.
However, a website can connect to the blockchain. But a website can be hacked. Your browser can be hacked. So what do you need? Both a software and a hardware handshake.
So, you plug in the device to your computer. The browser's extension can read the information from device and validate it which connects to their website which connects to the blockchain.
Think of it from a hacking point of view: they can send you a spam email, get your login info, and get everything from thousands of miles away. Are you screwed? No. Why? Because you have your physical device. And your phone. So it provides an extra layer of security where even the location of the numerals for your pin is different each time so if someone is recording actions of your mouse, browser, or monitor, they can't guess what your pin is. They could get some ideas of the pattern. For instance, if your pin has "11" in it and you hit the same exact spot with a mouse then they know that you have the same number twice in a row. Do they know which number it is? No. They can only tell how many times the numbers repeat and how many total numbers are used (ex: if your pin is a combination of 1, 2, and 3, then they know that you're only using 3 out of 9 numbers which significantly reduces their guessing times).
The best thing about Trezor and other similar wallets is that YOU, not some exchange, controls the private keys. So nobody can take your crypto away from you unless they basically break in to your house and hold you hostage. In which case, you have other things to worry about.

You should use GDAX, a Coinbase company. You can buy and sell with zero fees if you put in a Limit order. If you put in a Market order (i.e. buy/sell ASAP at any available price) then you still get charged a fee... but it's 0.25% (i.e. a quarter of one percent) which is a lot better than the 4% you're being charged now.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:38:19
There are a few things going on:
* are the fees high compared to the real world way of sending things (ex: wire)? No.
* are the fees high compared to Bitcoin Cash? Yes.
So that's the complaint - compared to Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin is expensive.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:45:26
* don't buy on Coinbase, buy on GDAX since it's cheaper
* on GDAX, the highest fee is 0.25% for market orders (i.e. a quarter of one percent) and the lowest fee is free for limit orders
* if you want to buy and hold rather than trade then, after the fork, move the coins to your own wallet rather than hold it on the Exchange

aaaand we broke down, not up so we're in 6530s with 6525 being the next resistance :[
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:47:09
No problem but do your own research. I could be full of crap for all you know :]
I think a lot of money is waiting on the sidelines to see where it'll go. Look at the BTC vs. BCC chart - they sync and I think that resolution will be the catalyst between the two.
If you're nervous, sell. I have 6 BTC and I'm not [terribly] worried. Let's go to the charts..
* look at the 1-hour chart
* higher lows: 5520, 5666, 6315, 6450, 6500, 6550
* resistance: 6750 is resistance that was hit twice
This is a wedge forming with an upper breakout potential. Here's an example in ETH:
* look at the 1-hour chart
* higher lows: 303.6, 306. 309, 313, 315
* resistance: 319, hit multiple times
What happened was a burst from 315 to 325 (3%+) which is ~$6800 in case of BTC (which, funny enough, has a resistance at $6830). What happened after that in ETH? Another 3.5% gain. That's $7040 in BTC, i.e. $7k I was talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:17:37
It dropped by $500+ because of a massive correction since it just went up by $1000+ in a few days.
There were very few buyers and sellers were trying to lock in profits while short sellers were trying to recoup their earlier destruction.
You can look at what happened with GDAX during their patch earlier this week - the price fell only a little bit (was it $50? Maybe less) and immediately went up after GDAX reopened.
The math you need to do is what you think B2X will be worth. For instance, say BTC is worth $7500 at the fork with B2X worth $2000. This means BTC has to fall to less than $5500 for you to lose money. A 26%+ drop in literally an hour? Not impossible but not probable.
I expect a bump going into the fork with a slight drop (maybe 1%) right before.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:28:23
How is it not free money? The only way it's not free money is if:
* Pre-fork BTC = post-fork BTC + post-fork B2X
Then, mathematically, it's the same thing with no free money. However, it won't be and it hasn't been in any other fork. I.e. you get free money.
B2X futures are currently $1350. Presuming these levels hold, BTC is required to drop to $5725 directly after the fork. Any price higher than that means you get free money.
If the fork happened right now, you get $1350/BTC in free money.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:13:28
Look at what happened in 2008 - everyone sold everything. In times of panic, cash is king. Everything would lose value - stocks, gold, and I don't see why Bitcoin would be exempt.
What people typically do is sell everything and wait for the dust to settle and then buy back.
Bitcoin offers zero protection from anything else and if you think the world is ending, cash is guaranteed to be stable compared to anything else.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:14:38
So it'll go down 9%? That's sort of like what we had between 7400 to 6800 last week. It recovered in a few days and hit all time highs later on.
Will a crash happen? Sure, it happened before. It has recovered since for every single crash.
Also stocks are more than double from that level today.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:55:05
By the way, looks like B2X fugures are heading back to $1000 range which would affect this math. BTC would need to fall to $6500 now or 15.4%.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:03:22

I'd examine previous support levels and psychological barriers. For instance, 7k is both a support and a psychological barrier. Prior to say, I'd say 6666 but then 6100, 5800, 5500, 5150, and 5000.
Then it depends on what you want to do. You can put bids above those figures to definitely get in but sometimes through sheer market order selling, the volume can go through the barriers for a split second. You can often put an order $50+ *below* the support and still get in. This happened a few days ago during the correction from the ATH when it went below 7000 like a hot knife through butter.

@_date: 2017-11-03 22:08:43
I hope so. Watch, I'll be insanely wrong. After the fork, BTC will go to $10k and B2X will go to... $10k and I'll be thoroughly confused.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:47:41
GDAX is a Coinbase company. It's their trading platform so keeping BTC on GDAX will give you B2X as well.
So, timeline:
* Keep BTC on GDAX (or Coinbase, whichever you prefer)
* Post-fork, move BTC to a wallet
Also, moving BTC between GDAX and Coinbase is free and instant with no limit... because it's the same company.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:45:09

They were at ~$2500 not too long before that.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:54:44
You can't unless you do some quick math and watch it in real time. Here's a timeline:
* say you want that $6500
* you see 5 BTC there already
* you put an order for 1 BTC @ $6500
* you now see 6 BTC. You're now the last order
Now you watch...
* 7BTC. This means 2 BTC were added. Now they're last.
* 5BTC. This *could* mean that those 2 were removed or someone before you removed theirs (though likely 2 that were just added were removed)
* 2 BTC. You're either next or you're at most 1 BTC away
* 1 BTC. Now you can watch the "fills" on your screen. If it starts to move (i.e. anything filled), this means you're next.
* 200 BTC. Doesn't matter, you're still first and only your order will execute next
Something to keep in mind: BTC has a positive bias. This means that, generally speaking, most transactions are buys even if they're for very small amounts (even $0.50).
This means that if you're selling, there's a very high chance that your order will be filled. But if you're buying, there's a small[er] chance about your order being filled. So I err on the side of less greedy and more guarantee of order execution when I buy.
This is as opposed to ETH which has a negative bias which is the inverse of the above.
P.S. keep watching that wedge form and bounce between the two numbers. [Bitcoin Cash]( chart is dropping. What does this mean? It'll break on the up side and we'll likely be above $6700+ in a few hours.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:05:22
You must be fun at parties :P
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:36:42
Yep, we're on the same page. Problem is - what would it drop to? It's holding at about 7k level and B2X is slowly going down - the two charts aren't very correlated. If one's up, the other should be going down proportionately and that hasn't been the case.
At this rate, B2X could open at $1k and if BTC stays at $7k'ish then it seems like it's a net gain.
Sure, less than $7650 BTC + $2500 B2X but still a gain.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:23:44


You know nothing about me to make this statement.


Population of Venezuela compared to the world that uses "fiat" currency without issues? Right, a rounding error.
You're forgetting the one benefit of inflation - lowered debt. If you get a 30-year fixed mortgage and keep it, you'll owe less money as time goes on because inflation erodes the current value of the debt.
We'll se what happens in the next crash when Bitcoin, like everything else, will fall, but the problem is - we both would have moved on by then so I wouldn't tell you "I told you so".
That's the trouble about people writing things online - there are no consequences if you're wrong.

Based on other crashes, people tend to sell EVERYTHING and then buy things to protect themselves. In 2008, even gold fell.
So, Bitcoin, like everything else, will also fall. How quickly it'll come back up depends on a lot of factors such as why the market crashed. For instance, if the central banks do something that devalues the currency then it's likely Bitcoin will skyrocket back up since all that cash has to go somewhere and money markets pay nothing.

You can't compare Bitcoin to the USD. USD is a reserve currency and represents a country that's valued at over [$125+ trillion](
Bitcoin isn't going anywhere near that since, to say the least, it represents no country.

Crap, based on this, Google, Amazon, and Apple should fall by at least 70%.
Oh wait, the companies are more popular than ever? Make a ton of money? Oh, so there's more value now than a few years ago? I guess the higher valuations are legit.
Bitcoin fell by 30% from it's all time highs. We recovered about half the losses since then. This is perfectly normal.
Can we fall more? Sure, it's not impossible. The key will be Bitcoin Cash and how that settles. If Bitcoin Cash will continue to fall from its all time highs then Bitcoin will recover. Bitcoin Cash fell by over 50% and it's recovered about a third of the losses so far.

How doesn't it make sense to you, an "experienced investor"? There is reward: if SegWit2x succeeds, it'll become Bitcoin and the current Bitcoin will go away. This means B2X will skyrocket in price.
And what do you mean no reward? You're getting B2X coins for free just by holding BTC. If you think it'll take off - and I personally don't know - then it's a great investment with immediate rewards.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:08:14
What do you mean? Bitcoin Cash isn't $2400 right now - it's nowhere near that. Based on the price of Bitcoin Cash between $2400 and today, it was the best possible move to sell it at $2400.
Now if you believe it'll go up, it's still the best possible move to sell so you can buy it cheaper before it goes up.
If you don't think Bitcoin Cash is going go up then it's also the best possible move.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:30:43
To lower your fees, use GDAX (which is a Coinbase company). Put in a limit order and you have $0.00 in fees.
Buy slow so you know how it works. Literally spend $10 to buy Bitcoin. See what a market order is like (0.25% fee, i.e. a quarter of one percent), buy, sell, use a limit order. Since you're spending $10, it doesn't matter what the price is like - you're losing very little money but you're gaining experience.
Then put in more money and do what you want to do with it. I suggest you dollar-cost-average it, i.e. put in limit orders for $100/mo or so over the next year. If you put in $1k all at once now and if Bitcoin corrects then you could lose a lot (on paper). The safer way is to do it slowly which will make you less money but it'll also lose you less money. Do this until you get the hang of it.

There are a few ways to use Coinbase but I focus on lowering my fees so here's what I do:
* I linked my bank account
* I transfer money from my bank account to Coinbase. There is no fee for this but it takes 3-4 business days (OP's link shows this might be instant soon)
* After I get the money in Coinbase, I move it to GDAX (a Coinbase company). This is instant and free
* I buy Bitcoin on GDAX. If you put in a limit order, there is no fee to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:36:43
That's not how it works and you can read up on these types of orders. Pro tip: the stock market has the same types of orders so it's not a bad thing to know anyway.
How does a limit order work. For all transactions, whether it's crypto or stocks, you have a huge list of sellers and a huge list of buyers. For instance, I bet there's a limit order to buy Bitcoin at $3,000 and another order to sell at $10,000. You think either order will fulfil today? No. So how does Bitcoin get bought or sold? It's when a seller and a buyer matches. So let's say there's a seller at $6000.01 and a buyer at $6000.00. If someone bought Bitcoin, the price changes to $6000.01. If someone sold, it's $6000.00.
How does the price move? When you run out of sellers or buyers and there's the next transaction. Let's play a fantasy transaction. Here's our transaction tree:
* Seller at $10,000 for 1 bitcoin
* Seller at $6,000.01 for 1 bitcoin
* Buyer at $6,000.00  for 1 bitcoin
* Buyer at $3,000.00 for 1 bitcoin
If nobody is buying or selling, price stays the same. But what if someone says screw it and they put in a market order to spend $10,000.01? This means the next available seller will have a sale. They'll sell them their $6000.01 bitcoin and the buyer will have another $4000 that'll be spent. That money is going to be spent on the next seller which, in our case, will be selling at $10,000. So the price of Bitcoin will go to $10,000 with one seller selling $6000 worth of Bitcoin.
You cannot place a buy limit order at the lowest sale price. Vice versa, you cannot place a sell limit order at the lowest buy price. Why? Because that's what a market order is.
... I'm sure this might be confusing - you might be better served watching videos on market/limit orders.

I looked this up a while back when I was looking into these fees and I found that Walmart and Amazon paid them. They get discounts on the misc charges but not the fees. Maybe this changed.
Do you have a source? I'm curious now.


I think once Bitcoin settles a bit and becomes more adopted, people will start using it. If Bitcoin goes up or down 5%, people won't be spending it as much as Bitcoin going up 0.2% every day.

Bitcoin is not a stock but its value relation to other currencies goes up and down.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:51:40
I think that once the price stabilizes, it'll be used as currency. Right now there's no incentive to use Bitcoin unless you think the price will drop. Considering it's been making all time highs, there's incentive to keep it.

Wire transfers cost money and I'm trying to lower my fees.

I see no reason for the demand to stop once they've all been mined. Let's put on a fantasy hat and imagine that all the coins have been mined but all global retailers now announced that they will accept Bitcoin. What do you think this will do to the price?

I use GDAX to buy BTC.
* Costs nothing to move money to Coinbase but takes ~4 days.
* Costs nothing to move money from Coinbase to GDAX (the trading platform) and it's instant.
* If you put in a [Limit order]( the fee to buy Bitcoin is $0.00. Market orders have a fee but it's &gt; 1% (I think a quarter of one percent).
* Then transfer away and the fee is pretty low (I think &gt;1%)

Coinbase and GDAX are the same company so once you get a Coinbase account, you get a GDAX account at the same time. You can purchase Bitcoin via Coinbase but the fees are 1.5-4% which is very expensive. On GDAX, you can purchase Bitcoin (also Ethereum and Litecoin).
There are a few types of orders but typically people use either Market or Limit.
* Market: buy or sell IMMEDIATELY at whatever price is available. Fee: 0.3% (i.e. one third of one percent)
* Limit: buy or sell at whatever price you select. Fee? $0.00. No restrictions.
Copying I'm relatively new to crypto but I have some info - ask me questions :]
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:17:55


That's correct because you control the private key.


Sort of. It's not really relate to how much is spent but how many places you can spend it.
How about this - let's put on our fantasy hats - let's imagine that it's announced that PayPal, Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon are now accepting Bitcoin for payments. What do you think the value of Bitcoin is going to be the next day? Do you think more people spent Bitcoin overnight to warrant such high levels? No. So it's the *perception* of value that matters as opposed to *actual spending*.


Yes because you can indeed send and receive Bitcoin via hardware wallet. It's not like putting your cash in a safe - the hardware wallet just keeps it safe but you can plug it into your computer and move Bitcoin.


I expect the value of the new not-really-bitcoin to drop as the majority of people are going to be dumping it in favor of bitcoin. Once it hits bottom, you *could* make money off the bounce but it's very risky and try not to catch a falling knife.


This depends on peoples preferences. My opinion is that the serious Bitcoin investors don't go to this sub. I'd be surprised if many people here had over 10 Bitcoins. Disclosure: I have over 1 Bitcoin now and I'll be buying more later this week.
Last note since you're new (I'm also relatively new). Don't invest any money that you can't lose.

That's actually relatively low. Industry standard for excellent uptime is the five 9's or: 99.999%.
99.91% uptime means they were down for almost 2 hours within 90 days.

Credit cards charge 2.5%-4.1%. If Amazon's entire revenue comes from Bitcoin rather than credit cards, that's close to $3 billion in yearly savings.
So if only 1% of Amazon's revenue comes from Bitcoin, that's still almost $30 million dollars in yearly savings with no detriment.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:45:35
I can guarantee you that Amazon does not own Visa, MasterCard, Discover, or Amex who charge these fees.
There are multiple types of fees though:
* swipe fee
* processor fee
* merchant fee
Probably a few other fees I'm forgetting. Amazon can't do anything about those base rates. They can be their own processor but they still send data to those actual credit cards which charge those fees. Visa alone is worth over a quarter of a trillion dollars and Amazon is worth less than twice that much.

That's true but you can cancel and change your price so it'll eventually hit.

Coinbase and GDAX are the same company. Coinbase has higher fees because it's geared for the average user but if you watch a few videos, you can just use GDAX and save a ton on fees.

Since Bitcoin is volatile, don't put any money you're not OK with losing.
But if you have a hundred dollars or so burning a hole in your pocket every month then simply buy that every month. This will protect you from the dramatic swings.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:11:25
No problem! Bonus tip: if you place limit orders on GDAX, Bitcoin costs $0.00 to buy or sell.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:21:24
I think if you want experience, join the other companies that already do this. Figure out the business and then look for an improvement. Then branch off into your own company.
Here's a situation: let's say you have the best bot and everything works great. How are you, a random Internet person, going to convince others to give you money or access to their accounts? Trust is a massive problem.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:26:17
 Place a limit order. Fee? $0.00.

Unlike Coinbase, GDAX actually has good support. I received seven replies over 2 days unlike Coinbase which I think has a filter for support requests (file-&gt;autoclose). Odd since it's the same company.

A guy with 33k subscribers on YouTube knows more than Jamie Dimon, a guy worth over $1,100,000,000? Now I know why this guy is sitting in the video - it's the weight of his massive balls.
I loved what Jamie Dimon said. It made Bitcoin fall... so I bought it on sale. Is Jamie wrong? Totally but I benefitted.
Also, Jamie Dimon was talking about the value ... of currency... compared to Bitcoin. So all this research about banks and their fees is just a waste of time. I have a regular bank and in the decade that I've had it, I paid $0.00 in fees. There is an ATM fee if I use an ATM of another bank... that is 100% reimbursed by the bank.
Banks are worried about Bitcoin because they have no control over it but banks aren't the only group. Governments too are worried about it. Don't forget that USD and BTC are in competition. So he's right to be worried - there's unregulated competition for assets that's kicking his butt. But, you think his friends at other brokerages didn't buy Bitcoin on the dip and give him his cut? Of course they did. This is skirting around insider trading but that's how these people make billions of dollars in a few days compared to David Hay who makes $1,500/mo.
The clickbait title isn't helping things any. Publicly humiliated by a guy with 33k subscribers with this video getting 5,200 views? Come on.

I wonder how many people on this sub have less than 1 bitcoin. If you watch various videos of people trading Bitcoin, they seem to buy a few hundred dollars worth and make $10 profit, maybe.

Thanks, your comments have been helpful but can I assume that if I don't have any Bitcoin transactions during the fork then I won't have any issues?

What's your financial situation like? Do you have any credit card debt? Student loans? Other debt? How much money are you saving?
Here's an honest question: how much money are you willing to lose? Whatever that number is... that's how much you should invest in Bitcoin. Why? Because Bitcoin is still very volatile. You could make it - and hopefully you do - but you could also lose it all.
Are you OK with losing it all? Honestly? If so then you can invest. If not then don't or at least not yet.
I suggest you sort out your finances. If you have credit card debt at 20%+, if you have tens of thousands of student loans then investing a lot of money is a bad decision.
But if you have no credit card debt, your student loans are on track to getting paid off quickly and you're saving an extra few hundred a month then you can invest some on Bitcoin.


No, you can buy a tiny fraction of it - so small that it's worth less than a penny! Presuming you're in a position to invest, I suggest investing in Bitcoin by adding an amount every month (or a regular interval) rather than dumping everything into it. Bitcoin is near an all time high. Can it go up? Totally. Can it go down? Well, anytime something goes up a lot, it comes down and consolidates. So if you invest everything now and Bitcoin goes down to 5700, you'll be disappointed. If you keep adding every month, you're decreasing your risk.
Good luck!

I can guarantee you that as secure as Coinbase is, PayPal is a lot more secure.


I think they can undo the transaction so perhaps. If this is a real concern for you then I suggest not doing it.

Just remember that once you make an account on Coinbase, you already have an account at GDAX. They might need more verification but it's awesome and it's just like a regular stock trading platform... WITH NO FEES. The only fee is if you place a market order (i.e. instant sell at any available price) which is still lower than Coinbase.
Coinbase is good for amateurs who just want to buy/sell Bitcoin now and then. If you're a trader or you want to keep your fees either low or non-existent then go with GDAX. You'll learn the system in about 5 seconds. It's very quick and you can actually see real time Bitcoin prices rise and fall.

Treat Bitcoin like a high risk investment and put it money you can afford to lose.
I suggest you fund 401k first, especially if you get a company match. Then fund a Roth IRA account since you get tax benefits when you retire and this is less volatile than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:35:01
You can buy Bitcoin with a credit card on Coinbase. It has a 4% fee and low purchase limits.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:57:25
Coinbase is pretty secure.


I don't think you can send money like that through Coinbase since you need to have both banks added under one account. They're not going to give you their bank info with verification.
So what you want is a way to send money to someone but not ever pay for it. There is only one way and it's not secure: you mail them a check. Everything else you have to pay a fee (ex: wire, PayPal, etc).
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:01:29


No, they're already connected.


No. If you buy more through GDAX, it stays in GDAX. Avoid Coinbase entirely. You can move money/Bitcoin back and forth through GDAX with lower - or non-existent - fees.
But since you asked, if you buy something on GDAX, you *can* move it to Coinbase and vice versa. It's instant and 100% free with no limit.

Here's a general comment **against** any security related to biometrics: you typically can't change them whenever you like.
Eye scan? OK, but it still gets translated to a string. What if someone hacked that? Too bad, you can't ever change it. Face? Presuming it stays the same - which it doesn't - same problem. Fingerprints? Same problem.

This only affects if you're moving money from your bank account to Coinbase so you can then buy Bitcoin. This move typically takes 3-4 business days.
This has no relation to owning or selling Bitcoin. It's only funding your Coinbase account.
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:13:27
There's no guarantee that it'll sell since someone likely placed the same order before you but it's definitely the best way to sell w/o a fee.

No catch at all. They "get you" on placing a market order. If you buy/sell stocks, it's usually a flat fee - something like $5-15. GDAX market orders? 0.0025% which is a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:38:14
You need ~$6k to buy one bitcoin but you can spend $0.01 to buy a fraction of a Bitcoin if you like.
I suggest you use GDAX (a Coinbase company) since you can buy and sell Bitcoin with $0.00 in fees if you use limit orders.
