Thank you! I spent a long time searching for a QR code generator that I could print in high resolution. This site is amazing!

Lol. I live in British Columbia where weed is legal. There has been talk of a stoned yoga/meditation class lately. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:50:38
That's the city where the yoga studio is located

Thank you for sharing! I purposely posted a picture where the code was at a bit of an angle and doesn't scan because I just wanted to share my exciting development and wasn't looking for donations. The code reads in person. Thank you again. It's beautiful when people look out for each other. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 02:49:22
:) Right back at you!

Nope :) just straight up yoga, meditation, personal training, and hypnotherapy.

I'm not using a payment processor. 
I shouldn't go into the specifics of how I handle my Bitcoin.
 
@_date: 2019-02-08 21:30:29
This comment made me smile �� I'm so grateful for the Bitcoin community. Not only for helping me personally to understand, but also all the energy devoted to the project to bring it to where it is now. Standing on the shoulders of giants. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 22:48:10
I'm lucky to have an extremely knowledgeable teacher who has ensured I have enough education to protect myself and my Bitcoin. I feel like I know just enough to realize I don't really know anything. But I definitely agree with you. I have heard of so many people losing all their coins. Lost keys/leaving on exchanges/stupid mistakes. The situation definitely deserves respect and awareness

Thank you.

Haha. �� Impossible. You're always in complete control in hypnosis. It's up to you to accept or reject any suggestions that I make. And I would absolutely never do that to you ��
@_date: 2019-02-08 09:26:57
Yes! 
@_date: 2019-02-08 23:47:47
Gender aside... I think a lot of people still feel nervous about accepting Bitcoin simply because they realize they don't have the knowledge to properly use it or keep it safe.(speaking from experience). 
There is so much misinformation out there and a lot is fear based. 
I am very lucky and grateful to have an amazing teacher that walked me through each step and ensured I have all the information to protect myself.

Oooo, thank you for the advice. I wouldn't have thought about that.

Just want to clarify that I am not looking for donations. :) I tried and I believe that the QR code in this image isn't scannable. Just sharing my excitement with like minded people. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 08:03:29
Zero conf is fine for a 15 dollar yoga class. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 09:27:39
No �� very easy. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 05:25:03
Thank you ��

I'm grateful to have the opportunity! ��
@_date: 2019-02-08 01:48:59
Edit * I'm not here looking for donations or asking anyone to send me BTC. Just sharing my excitement. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 23:08:16
It works in person. The picture is at a bit of an angle so not scannable. Also I didn't want people thinking I was looking for donations. Thank you for telling me you weren't able to scan ��
@_date: 2019-02-08 16:44:08
My thoughts exactly!
@_date: 2019-02-10 00:07:25
Thank you. I looked at BTCPay a while back. It might be time to revisit that. Thank you for sharing that information

Thank you so much this is very valuable information for me. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 20:57:48
Thank you. I would love to connect with the people at Blockstream! I'm inspired to have a platform to expose and educate my community to Bitcoin as I  believe the values are aligned with myself and my yoga studio. The level that Blockstream operates on is a little intimidating since I'm a small business and still in the phase of sharing very basic information with the public. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 19:49:14
Wow can't believe I got that wrong! OP edited.
