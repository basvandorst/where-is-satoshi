You're right. Prices are not old but there is a problem. Maybe the CRYPTOFINANCE add-on has been updated and behavior is different.
Once the CRYPTOFINANCE add-on have permissions, the formulas need the following change.
Current:   =CRYPTOFINANCE("BTC/USD")
Should be: =CRYPTOFINANCE("BTC/USD","price")
I will update this on the spreadsheet.
Thanks for pointing this!!!

In "History" tab just work with USD instead EUR (you can edit the header to USD). And in "Positions" you only need to adjust the formula in G column.

Today I sent some amount from one exchange to another and after a minute, when I was checking if the first confirmation happened...    the transaction was done! 
Fee it was 0.3%
Why people is saying that bitcoin is slow and expense to move?

I'm using a web portfolio and a mobile app portfolio, but I want to have my trading info outside of these platforms.

Mobile app allows easy verification. 
I use GDAX for 0% fees

It could happen and there is a warning on GDAX you have to agree. In Advanced there is the limit option.

bitcoin = $1,000,000
satoshi = $0.01 = 1 cent
I think it's an "easy to remember" scenario that would make easy understandable conversions and bring mass adoption.

There's not gurus for undiscovered worlds. Nobody sees the future. Just do your bet based in risk. Risk is high, but profits too.

Bitcoin Cash or Bcash has lost a lot of credibility after seeing what they promoters do with their fingers in twitter.

Agree. This is another world. I'm sorry for your loss.
