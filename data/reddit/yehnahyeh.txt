For either of those to happen we can not be relying on 5 way consensus to update bitcoins reference implementation. I hope Gavin removes commit access to 3 other core committers or makes his own implementation with one other co-developer.

In any case it does hold true for bitcoin and we are now at the "then they fight you" stage.
**Who**  
Most of the banking system and most branches of government.
**Why**   
Bitcoin undermines their power and ability to extract wealth from people. 
**How**   
Manipulating public opinion against bitcoin through the media  
Anti-bitcoin laws  
Improving the legacy system
There does not have to be a winner and loser, bitcoin can continue to be successful alongside the legacy monetary system.

Sidechain coins are 1-1 pegged to bitcoin, you can always get 1 sidechain coin for a bitcoin and you can always get 1 bitcoin for a sidechain coin.
This means their values will be the same. This mean when a sidechain coin can do some new valuable thing that bitcoins couldn't do the value of the sidechain coin and bitcoin should go up.

The code does, that is how, and why, sidechains work. 
When you move your bitcoins into a sidechain they never actually leave bitcoin, there is no such.. how could they even..  They are still bitcoins but they are frozen until you move the same amount of sidechain coins back. so you can always get a bitcoin for a sidechain coin and vice versa so they have to have the same value.

Not true at all Gavin and others have been campaigning for bigger blocks since at least 2013. He has had to do this to snap bitcoin development out of paralysis and inertia.

The way most users will use probably use them for recreational gambling they will get better odds as there is no house to take an edge. A decentralized prediction market could go much deeper and into complicated events. 
On a decentralized prediction market you can put up your own event for people to trade/bet on, it could be something that no sportsbook would put up or that betmoose would not allow (will there be a terrorist attack in the USA in 2016?).
There would be no limiting rules like maximum bet.
The authorities can not shut down decentralized prediction markets. 
The thing I am most excited about in prediction markets is "if then" type predictions. 


A sportsbook could offer that market but they don't. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 05:53:29
Right but it is not working well enough as miners are leaving out legit transactions where there is still room in the blocks. 
The fee is a reward for putting a transaction in. We may need a punishment for leaving a transaction out.

I know Gavin did not want to run it this way, the fact is the bitcoin core development by 5 party consensus model has failed and will continue to fail, a circuit breaker is needed. Personally I would rather Gavin just take control of core and improve scalability there but I guess he does not want to.

1mb blocks are a limit to scalability because blocks are nearly 1 mb in size and growing. 430-terabyte-limited blocks would be an obstacle to scalability when current blocks are nearly 430 terabytes in size. 20mb blocks would be a limit to scalability if blocks were nearly 20mb in size and growing

From the genesis block until about now there has always been spare space in blocks. BIP 101 has been working flawlessly on testnet for 6 months, there is nothing careless about increasing the block size. 
Letting blocks get full and hoping the ideas in the core scaling roadmap come to fruition is the careless and risky option.
@_date: 2015-06-14 14:06:21
influencing the block size limit is not such a huge power that you are making it out to be. The block size limit is just one parameter and effectively miners already do influence it, relax.

That is a complete non issue as the demand for that does not exists. The demand for more than 3 blockchain tps does exist so that is what we need to scale to now. 
All we need to do to scale bitcoin to hundreds of thousands of tps is to remove the obstacles to growth as they emerge over time and exponential advancements in bandwidth and storage as well as new technical innovations will take care of the rest. 
So all we need to do now is remove the current obstacle to growth, the 3tps limit, increasing the block size or reducing the block time is the best way to do that.

This is a breakthrough! I support Jeff's proposal, it scales in step with demand, it takes action soon, its simple enough not to break anything and should have everyone's support. Also it will be improved and refined by the time it makes it into the code. I really think we will resolve this soon and be ready for the moon.
In a large part we can thank Gavin for Jeff's proposal, it would not have materialised in 2015 without Gavin's public ergency. When people hand wavingly dismissed his proposal he said come up with a detailed alternative that can be coded and solves the problems, and now that is exactly what has happened. The 20mb hard fork was a challenge for others to come up with something better, something like Jeff's proposal.

Not improving scalability is more risky than improving it. A simple block size increase is the most cautious option. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 23:17:04


This is a problem. Miners should be incentivized to include as many valid transactions as is possible in a block. For example if they choose to leave out a transaction that meets predefined requirements they should get 0.001 less block reward. 
Or something even harsher like if there is room in a block for valid transactions that has been waiting since before the last block then that block gets 0 mining reward. 
That reward will have to go somewhere perhaps to a random full node or a pool to be distributed to all nodes once it reaches 0.001 per node.
These are just ideas, we could think of something better but I minners should not have the option of choosing to leave out perfectly good transactions. That is how you get censorship.
@_date: 2015-06-11 09:53:19
the soft limit should default to the max block size. Miners can still set it lower if they like.

* Contains the word “bitcoin” for search results   
No change, keep existing name and URL 12 votes  
Advantages   
* Existing brand awareness, trust, google index, back links, IT setup et cetera, its working well so far.   
* Contains the word “bitcoin” and “bet” for search results  
* Uniform with the name and URL of sister sites (Bitcoin Casino Guide, Bitcoin Poker Guide et cetera)   
Disadvantages    
* Long   
* Boring   
* Key words separated by – is considered spammy by some   
Bitsharp  14 votes   
Advantages    
* More brandable and more memorable   
* Short    
* Unique “word” pronounces well in English    
Disadvantages   
* .net
And all the feedback I have gotten has been variations on these items, except one person said they like  becasue it is more versitile in an uncertain future, so if Etherium or dash take over it could still be used. I note that most people voting for no change are already past visitors and a rebranding is more about, new, future, visitors. 
IDK but the longer no decision is made the more likely no change becomes. Thanks for all your contributions.

Instead of block reward falling of a cliff every 4 years it should have the same 50% reduction gradually over every 4 years. So every single block reward is a few thousand satoshis less than the last block.

**Do not click on the link, that is what this clown and zdnet want, here is the full text.**
Earlier this year, I wrote to a dozen or so key Senators and Congressmen concerning the illegality of Bitcoin in the United States. What makes it illegal is Article 1, Section 8, Clause 5 of the Constitution of the United States. Only the US Treasury can coin currency. If the US government doesn't produce currency, it is illegal. End of story. Now you have the confirmation from a US Senator to prove it.
I originally wrote to these people to have an opportunity to testify in front of Congress against Bitcoin's use in the US as a currency. Bitcoin is only one of a dozen or so illegal currencies, but Bitcoin seems to be the main one to battle against. If that one's defeated, then it would render all of them as worthless, except for their original purpose of illegal purchases of weapons, drugs, and other contraband.
My response from Senator Coburn's office is given below, in its entirety.
Dear Mr. Hess,
Thank you for writing to me to express your concerns about cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin. I appreciate the opportunity to hear from you on this matter and share many of your concerns.
The IRS recently announced its ruling that cryptocurrencies will be taxed at capital gains rates rather than ordinary tax rates, so there is no longer ambiguity surrounding its tax treatment. I understand your concerns with the potential use of cryptocurrencies in money-laundering activities. This risk is certainly a potential threat, particularly since transactions exceeding ten thousand dollars do not require disclosure to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.
In terms of the Department of Treasury’s sole authority to produce currency, the definition of currency must be analyzed. Currency is legal tender recognized by the federal government. In other words, if the federal government does not disperse or remit cryptocurrencies, they are simply not legal currency. If the IRS were to accept bitcoin as tax payment or if Congress were to appropriate bitcoins, then a constitutional conflict would exist under Article I Section 8 Clause 5. I will continue to carefully monitor the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
Again, thank you for writing to me. Best wishes.
November 20, 2014
Tom A. Coburn, M.D.
United States Senator
TC: mpk
I hope this letter clears up any ideological conflicts for Bitcoiners and cryptocurrency types. The so-called currencies are illegal under the Constitution and there is no defense otherwise. If you feel that Senator Coburn's opinions on the issue are incorrect, then please feel free to write him. As for me, I rest my case.
However, I'm going to continue my lobby against cryptocurrencies and hope to testify before Congress on the matter.

No that is not happening and won't happen, yes there is 10% GST on all domestic retail sales, this "Further 10%" is you talking out of your ass. Trading bitcoin for fiat does not and will not incur GST. However if the exchange charges fees they have to add GST to their fee. This helps some people spread FUD that you have to pay GST to buy bitcoin. 
Its like this, if you buy $10,000 of btc and the exchange wants to make $100 they will have to charge $110. you will not have to pay $11,000 for the btc. Of Course the advertised fee has to include the 10% GST so if an exchange says they charge a 1% fee that already includes GST.


Obviously wrong as the "this" you refer to is wrong and a lot of new merchants are accepting btc all the time.

True in most cases but definitely not true about the [Bitcoin Betting Guide]( I am proud to say we have never included a brand that has turned out to be a scam. This is not due to good luck, we were offered money to includ coinbet.cc and bitomba and most of the other scams that have come and gone, with our experiance and knolage we could smel they were fishy and would not deal with them
We do criticize brands on the site. This is from our [Casino Bitcoin Review]( 


The reason we don't have many negative reviews is because there are hundreds and hundreds of shit sites out there that deserve negative reviews, we don't even have time to review and include all the good sites we want to at the moment, we arent going to waste time reviewing bad sites that will probably not exist in 6 months anyway. The best way we can steer people clear of the ever changing list of bad sites is to point them the the good sites that we test extensively. 
Also good information on how to avoid bitcoin gambling scams here.

I got answers from the founder I will post here. Everything below is from him 
No units can be sold on the market for now, SFI is not live on the exchange just in IPO phase so units outstanding is going up as investors buy units.
"I suggest seedcoin formalise this by making a policy where if Havelock ceases to be a viable way to buy and sell units investors can prove what their holding were and be provided another way to trade them."
yes you are right we could tackle this issue although as you can understand when preparing the prospectus to be listed on Havelock, the closing of the exchange itself is not the main point we address. As we discussed a few exchanges have closed in the past, although we do not see the same issues with Havelock which is owned and operated by a licensed Panama fund (the other exchanges like BitFunder and BTC-T were run by North American nationals and had either no company registration or no license whatsoever). 
Re. the proof of holdings it is easy for exchanges to keep having access to the unit holders databases, even a formal closed down (actually the former 2 exchanges closed by themselves in order to avoid potential legal problems) should not prevent Havelock and the listed companies to have access to the list of unit holders (at least their email addresses) and therefore re-create a ledger of unit holders and the number of units they hold at a given time. Let me go into more details about how the shareholding works. As mentioned in the prospectus, Seedcoin Fund entity (registered as 'Seedco Holdings Limited') will acquire stakes into these startups using the bitcoins raised on Havelock. These stakes will be held by that entity and 100% of the shares of Seedco Holdings Limited will be held in custody by Havelock Investments. This way Havelock investors are sure that the shareholding structure is transparent and no shares paid for with their bitcoins can be held outside of Havelock. Fyi I am the sole director of Seedco Holdings Limited so the structure cannot be affected by any internal issue to SHL either. I hope this is clearer.
SHL itself yes has the startup stakes clearly defined, however you have to understand since SFI units will be for trade on Havelockinvestments.com we will not be able to keep track on the unit holders info on a daily basis, that will vary too much. We will take snapshots of the unit holding structure of SFI at certain points in time surely but access to the Havelock database of unit holders is key to any potential post-closing scenario. At the moment we have the ledger of all investors in SFI but that ledger will change as soon as trade opens.
"This means that if the value of bitcoin goes up more than the value of the fund / start-ups you will be losing bitcoins/money?"
This is a recurring question for bitcoin investors in any investment, is it safer to keep bitcoin than investing and where is the biggest return. first you have to see it as two different types of investments. Holding BTC can be a better bet than investing BTC in a startup provided as you say BTC goes only in one direction and I agree the last year rate of increase would be hard to beat. However keep in mind some of these startups are in a 'bitcoin-centric' environment whereby they get their own revenues and profits in BTC (such as BTC.sx for example or Hive), others such as Mexbt only partially since part of Mexbt revenues will be in fiat. Specially for BTC.sx any volatility in BTC rate is beneficial to the platform, so if BTC happened to go down sharply as it did about three weeks ago, BTC.sx bottom line actually increases in volume (more trading = more profits). 
I would agree for most of the startups BTC rate could provide a better return if it did go up again in 2014 (and we hope it does although it will be difficult to beat the 2013 performance) however it is also a matter of choice in the impact of bitcoin on society. Many BTC holders like to invest in bitcoin-centric startups because they provide the infrastructure enabling more and more users to buy/sell/use bitcoin which in turn has a positive effect on BTC rate and I believe on society as a whole by reducing costs on bank transfers for example. So this question is not purely a number crunching question but a societal impact question and it is up to you to decide if you prefer to passively hold onto bitcoin or actively invest some of it in startups creating relevant services. My partners and I we have chosen to devote our time and efforts into Seedcoin for the objective of developing the bitcoin ecosystem via these startups and eventually the whole bitcoin economy.
Re. your reasoning about the value of the fund and the BTC rate I agree with it, but please note here (and although Havelock states all prices in USD as a reference as well) we are not looking for USDBTC return but a BTC return so we aim for bitcoin-denominated capital appreciation in our fund management work. Many other factors, unrelated to BTC instant rate would be taken into consideration if one tried to optimize USD return and that would differ for each investor's perspective. For example the rate at which investors have each personally acquired (or paid for mining resources) for the bitcoin which they used to buy units can affect their USD return on the fund so since we raise in bitcoin, invest in bitcoin and any dividends will be paid in bitcoin we focus on the BTC return of these investments.

The lack of price detail on your site and in that comment is a lack of transparency. 
When I checked  it had a 5% buy/sell spread and no other fees so in effect it cost 2.5% to go from bitcoin in Australia to fiat in the phils, which is what I am interested in (I have bitcoin and have to pay a developer in the phils fiat).
What is it with your service? Right now how many pesos would my developer in the phils get for 1 of my BTC?

Who opposes it that matters are the 4 not Gavin committers to bitcoin core. The way they have been running it is that all 5 need to agree for something to get in. 
This is impractical and will lead to Gavin removing the other 4s commit access or the necessary development getting done on other implementations that become the standard making bitcoin core irrelevant. 
I have not seen the other 4 committers comment on 8mb blocks a they did in rejecting 20mb blocks. I hope this means they are discussing it and getting somewhere in private but it might mean they have their fingers in there ears.

Nop. You want to calculate the difference between the amount you spent buying it and the amount you sell it for and submit that as a gain. Selling something is not income in that sense. 
In answer to the OP contact exchanges like bitstamp and coinbase and tell them what you want to do. They are aware of buyers who want to be the counter party and do the transaction off the exchange.  
@_date: 2014-04-12 11:57:31

I guess the likely outcome is people the gov needs to pay in other countries (as in their creditors/financiers) will accept USD but not the ecuadorian government e-currency so the government will seize citizens USDs from bank accounts but ever so justly replace them with the equivalent value in ecuadorian government e-currency.

In 6 years miners have not done anything contrary to the greater good of bitcoin. The reason we can have miner votes is because there is proof of work attached to them so they are very difficult to manipulate unlike other user votes. 
Perhaps there could be node votes where the node has to show 95% up time for the last 3 months or something to get a vote. IDK I am just not worried that miners are out to destroy bitcoin.

The problem here is that the answer differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. There are places like Australia where it is legal to play online poker but not legal to offer it for play. Then there are jurisdiction where it is illegal to play online poker. 
The laws and legal systems exist to serve the state and no one else, there is no moral obligation to comply and I recommend you mostly ignore them as they are mostly a hindrance. Some more details here.
I suggest you only bother developing heads up as any other model will be ruined by collusion. Good Luck

These bitcoin bonuses are a great way to start building your bankroll and have fun gambling. Even if you lose a few of your early bets you will still be in profit due to your bonus! We don’t recommend you choose a sportsbook and casino based on the bonuses alone, there are many other important factors and for that reason we have only included bonuses offered by the best and most reliable bitcoin gambling operators.
Have fun!

I talked to a couple of SMSF professionals and they said the problem was auditing. Some regulatory body (I forget the name) has to be able to audit the fund every year.

The solution the core devs come up with should force miners to process all waiting valid transactions in blocks. letting miners choose not to include valid transactions is very problematic, it is a blow to fungibility. The reason I believe miners deserve the block reward is because they secure the network and process valid transactions.

If you don’t want to compare the odds for each bet you make, just sign up to the sportsbooks that most often gives the best odds, then you know you are getting good value overall.

There are no specific laws relating to gambling with bitcoin. As such we assume that gambling with bitcoins falls in the same legal category as gambling with government currency. If online gambling with your local currency is legal where you are then online gambling with bitcoins is also legal where you are. If online gambling is illegal where you are gambling with bitcoins has the benefit of being anonymous. 
The laws and legal systems exist to serve the state and no one else, there is no moral obligation to comply and I recommend you mostly ignore them as they are a hindrance.

Again, I am not talking about running a martingale. The reason to expect your capital will diminish over time is if the odds are against you or in the short term if you are increasing your bets to chase losses or if each bet is too high a % of your bankroll, this is indeed a bad strategy.
But I am talking about a case where the odds are not against you and you are betting the same amount (or random amounts). If the results are random then betting randomly is a neutral strategy, not good or bad, short term results will be determined by luck, long term result will be ~breakeven

I asked the founder those exact questions!


if the unit price goes up after float you can profit by selling higher than you bought. 
Dividends are unlikely in the short term but a startup being bought or moving to series A funding is quite likely. At that point investors would get a pro-rata bitcoin payout into their Havelock accounts like a special dividend payment for whatever % of the company they "owned".


Yep, you could also make money in bitcoin even if the price of bitcoin goes down. That is more of an argument for not putting more than a certain % of holdings into it (I put 20%) 
All the startups hold bitcoins and get their revenue partly or fully in bitcoins and would benefit from the exposer that price rise's seem to bring so a rise in the value of bitcoins is good for them and increase their value as well.
There is also the fact that if you invest in this you are helping to grow and develop the bitcoin ecosystem which will help to raise the price more than holding would by increasing adoption. It can also make the world a better place.
Anyway I agree its not perfect but I think its the best option if your not a millionaire with access to a venture capital funds.

What would happen is a private company did the same thing? As long they can find a way to make their physical money un-counterfitable and people trusted the issuer and the issuer always honoured the pledge I think it could work. People would have more faith in it if there was more than 1 body that would convert it to bitcoin for them so even if the issuing state or corporation failed they could still redeem the tokens in another way

It’s as good as or better than any online casino I have ever seen and I am a professional gambler. So you get a casino as good as the best fiat operators but you get the bitcoin advantages of 
* Free and instant deposits and withdraws of any amount 24/7
* The betting operators save so much money in transaction processing and charge backs that they can give higher payouts
* Betting anonymously makes it impossible for a casino to limit you for winning too often or to sell your details and credit card information
* Betting anonymously makes it easier to avoid legal restrictions and tax burdens
Only 4 games to start off with (Baccarat, Blackjack, Lottery and Single 0 roulette) but it is literally an hour old so I suspect they will add more soon. The games they do have include all the features and options you can think of and the options and buttons are very logical and intuitive to use. 
Min bet is 1 mBTC max is 400 mBTC on standard tables. Your balance is displayed in mBTC.
The girls are pretty latinas, I would guess Costa Rican or Panamanian. They have quite strong accents which I personally like.  
For me this cements [Cloudbet](  (affiliate links) as THE leader in the bitcoin gambling industry as they also have a great sportbook. With this and [Nitrogen](  giving pinnacle odds all available to Americans, Chinese and Indians the % of the worlds gambling done in bitcoin has to go up sharply in 2014. Global spend is about $500b so it would not take a big % for gambling alone to make bitcoin price to go parabolic. 
good luck have fun!

@_date: 2014-09-17 23:58:41


So so many reasons that have nothing to do with bitcoin gambling so you will forgive me for giving the short version.
* Its only 5 years old
* There are many powerful entrenched interests against that happening
* Fiat currencies can increase their market cap almost at will with central banks and taxation to guarantee demand.
* Most people in the world do not have internet enabled devices and a stable connection.
* Most internet enabled devices are not secure
* Bitcoin education has not reached most people
And on and on totaly off topic so I will stop.

Your not thinking it though my man. you are saying it was pulled apart because sports betting is probably not a trillion dollar market.

I used to advocate a miniscule block reward reduction every single block and there is technical reason why that is not a good idea so I said lets just do it once a day then which solves the problems of doing it every 10 minutes.

miners will make money on transaction fees (that does not mean fees get higher, the number of transactions is what gets higher) 
The system maintains itself. if there is less profit in mining then less people mine then mining becomes easier then mining becomes more profitable then more people mine then mining becomes harder then mining becomes less profitiable then less people mine then mining becomes easier then mining becomes more profitable then more people mine then mining becomes harder and so on forever 
Its engender balanced motivation. The price of bitcoin does not depend on how hard they are to mine its the other way around.

On the VC and north american conference crowd he boarders on holier than thouness. Its the people who see $$$ and are launching $tartup$ that will build the on ramps and infrastructure that will make bitcoin a usable alternative for non tech savvy ppl in poorer countries with bad governments. They are good for the ecosystem, everyone who does not want to restrict bitcoin is invited to the party, whether they want to help others or get rich, as long as they don't want to restrict bitcoin their efforts are just as worthy as any.

Possible should not be confused with 100% easy and convenient but I still think it pretty awesome given that 6 months ago I could count the number of things I could buy with bitcoins on one hand. Some of these methods only make sense if you make income in bitcoin or if you are a hard core ideologue.

There are so many non harmful ways to tax bitcoin. You have described an incredibly harmful one like that is the model they will go for. 
What most of the bitcoin tax discussions don't realise is that tax departments rely ~5% on auditing and enforcement and 95% is voluntary compliance.

As you know if mining is not profitable less people do it, its gets easier, it becomes profitable again. 
I would think no fees or a mandatory fee could work instead of the current system of bribery. Anyway I know this is something the core devs are working on and will come up with something much better than me but my premise is miners should not be able to choose not to include valid waiting transactions and I would be surprised if anyone who is not a miner disagrees.

Exactly, miners used to be passionate bitcoiner with other jobs to pay the bills and they hodled most of their coins. Now mining is the full time job that has to pay the bills and the miners goals is to make government currency wealth they sell straight away. 
I really wish moves were taken against the centralisation of mining back in 2010-11. Gavin and the devs talked about wanting every water heater and every toaster to be a miner but nothing was done to make that more likely.

They show account creation with no identifying information, deposit and betting in around 2 minutes! Doing that at a fiat sportsbook or poker room without a credit card would take 3 business days. With a credit card (which they can charge, sell or have stolen anytime) it would be 15 minutes but you would still have to wait till they verified your ID and 3 business days for a withdrawal.

"We are taking a very competitive spread in the 3 to 4% range which is more competitive than any other local source"
Buy 534.84 sell 486.22
spread of $48.62 = ~10%
at the time Coinjar spot price was 501.80
so the machine is ~7% above coinjar spot price
Coinjar buy price including fee is 516.97
So the machine is ~3.3% above the real cost of buying at coinjar.

[Australians Can Pay All Basic Living Expenses With Bitcoin!]( 
Due to being able to buy groceries and petrol, pay bills and get prepaid bank cards with bitcoin through 3rd party services and gift cards its now possible for Australians to cover all basic living costs with bitcoins! This has ramped up extremely fast.
Possible should not be confused with 100% easy and convenient but I still think it pretty awesome given that 6 months ago I could count the number of things I could buy with bitcoins on one hand. Some of these methods only make sense if you make income in bitcoin or if you are a hard core ideologue.

I wrote about that actually, Yes volatility is a problem for a professional gambler who lives month to month on his gambling income and uses bitcoin for gambling but does not believe bitcoin will go up over time. In other words less than 0.001% or so of people who partake in bitcoin gambling :)
The vast majority of users are recreational players and have no expectation to increase their purchasing power through bitcoin gambling if anything they accept the opposite. Another large % of users including the more professional are bitcoin true believers that accept the volatility.
Also the volatility is reducing over time and will continue to do so anyway.
So yah not a big problem overall please see

Coinbase is blocking users from cashing bitcoins in or out of their Coinbase account due to having used their account to transact with bitcoin gambling sites.
Bitcoin Gambling operators should counter this by using a new address for every withdrawal as one of the reasons we love bitcoin is that it lets us avoid exactly this kind of government intervention in our lives.

Price will probably go up around CNY because that is the mid and long term trend. 
There is a rumor that 10 big 3rd party payment processors were told not to process transactions to bitcoin exchanges after CNY (yes the rumor appears to be accurate but there has never been an official statement so technically its a rumor).  
Here's the thing, all those payment processors have already stopped processing payments to Bitcoin exchanges so at CNY nothing changes. If anything people who were worried, such as the OP, breath a sigh of relief because they thought something bad would happen. Nothing bad happens so price goes up.
@_date: 2014-07-11 23:58:11

No, that might be the case if you choose to risk all your money such as by running a limitless martingale.
When I said "if you bet long enough" I did not mean if you martingale, with a 0 % house edge, on average you will breakeven (eventually) just by betting the same amount randomly.


The player can prevent themself from going broke in exactly the same way, restrict the amount you risk to a limited % of what is in your bankroll.

the way the scam worked was if the gox transaction did not get in the blockchain the customer still got their bitcoins on a different tx ID. Then the customers said to gox "I never got my bitcoin" gox checked for the tx ID, did not find and though he was right so they sent it again. So customer gets what he had x 2. Gox let themselves be scammed, what we don't know is how much BTC.

On [BitStars]( you can deposit from PayPal and have it instantly converted to bitcoins in your balance which you can then withdraw as bitcoin. The exchange rate is about 3% worse than Bitstamp which as good as you can get in most places and much better than at a bitcoin ATM.
You do not have to complete any know your customer (KYC) malarkey like sending in a copy of your ID and a utility bill. By depositing you will get a bonus with a playthrough requirement but you can just click a button to forfeit the bonus then you are good to go. I have done it and it works really well. [More info](

That could not be further from the truth, at least for the good ones. You only need to set a username and password and you can instantly deposit any amount and bet up to 50 BTC per bet! Not what I would call a hassle compared to the ID verification and deposit and bet limits at fiat sportsbooks.
The big advantages of sports betting with bitcoins are  
* Almost instant and free deposits and withdraws of any amount 24/7
* Betting anonymously makes it impossible for a sportsbook to limit you for winning too much or to sell your details and credit card information
* Betting anonymously makes it easier to avoid legal restrictions and tax burdens
* The sportsbook save so much money in transaction processing and charge backs that they can give you better odds.
Here are [reviews for the best bitcoin sportsbooks]( the top 3 all give the best sports betting experience and odds (same as pinnacle odds) I have ever found and I have been a professional bettor and worked at multiple sportsbooks. 
This is the future of sports betting. Good luck!

The provably fair way for a site to deal cards is for the site to shuffle the deck as normal then provide you with a hash of the shuffle. As a card is dealt you provide a random seed, manually or automatically generated in your browser (client side, not on the sites server) that the site cannot see or predict. Your seed changes the card to something neither you nor the site can have known. This is the online equivalent of cutting the deck to the dealers shuffle.
After the hand is dealt the deck is laid out and you can check that the deck started out as the hash the site provided indicated and that the cards were then changed in accordance with the seed you provided. If these are both the case then you have just played a provably fair hand!

My bet is NAB has given them more time but does not want it to be announced. I am surprised its taking them so long to get a new bank though. So you are a higher risk company, that means you pay more fees and have to pass them on to the customers in your margin, see every legit gambling website.
Go to Bank X and ask to partner, they say no, to risky. Say you will give them x$ and X% of transactions until x = what they would say yes to.

That bitcoin interviewee was fantastic! [These youtube videos]( show why bitcoin will take over gambling.
Sign up with no identifying information, deposit and bet all in less than 2 minutes. Doing that with fiat would take 15 minutes with a credit card that the bookie can now charge, sell or have stolen at any time and it would take 3 business days without a credit card, in either case you have to verify your ID before withdrawing.

I have just signed up to Bitkup, it’s a cool service that charges users a one time entry fee of ฿0.05 that is put in a pool with everyones entry fee. Users then make predictions on the outcome of all games in the FIFA World Cup and get points if they guess right. Bitkup will display a leaderboard showing how all users are doing compared to each other. Lastly when everyones score is final Bitkup will distribute the pool of funds to the winners! Full details in link.
It gives users interest and excitement in every match! I am not affiliated with or paid by betkup in any way I just think its another case of the gambling industry pushing the envelope of technology and censorship resistance moving the bitcoin ecosystem forward!

TL;DR 
We got one great question from the audience on bitcoin which referenced the lack of trust in the current system, advancements in technology and the growth of alternatives like kickstarter and peer to peer lending that remove the middle men. 
In reply Ms Legared wheeled out the all too predictable " bitcoin is for money laundering derp" and even said it was suspicious. As was the tone of the whole show she let us know there needs to be a hierarchical centralised government at the heart of everything for it to be valid and worthy and safe from evil money launders. She did admit the current system was not perfect.

There are many fait transactions that require permission or processing from a financial institution before they are allowed to happen, with bitcoin transactions you don't need permission from anyone and processing is 10 minutes. 
Try to deposit, bet and with draw on a fiat sportsbook, then do the same on these [bitcoin sportsbooks]( its like night and day. I detail this in [my bitcoin aha moment]( With fiat there is a sign up form then you have to send documents to prove your ID, wait 3 days for a bank transfer or if you want instant deposit use a cc that they can sell or re-charge later and when you withdraw they will make you send copies to verify your cc, ba you if you win too much sned unwanted promotion to you email and house...

TL;DR 
A great example of how the gambling industry pushes the envelope of technology and censorship moving the bitcoin ecosystem forward!
[Bitstars]( one of the world’s best bitcoin casinos has added the ability to deposit from a credit/debit card or PayPal. The corresponding bitcoins are instantly credited to your account and you can withdraw them. No need to send in ID or a utility bill. Price is about 3% worse than Bitstamp price which is much less than ATMs or local bitcoins.

No, when a bank receives $10 they keep $10 lend out $90. That is fractional reserve lending. Its the same 9:1 ratio you mention but banks only need the 1 to lend out the 9. Technical they are not creating new money they are creating new debt.

We are already 4 years down the road with bitcoin gambling and the early implementations have been full bitcoin services; deposit, bet and withdraw all denominated in bitcoin. 
If there is a move for government currency sites to use bitcoin as a funding method that would be a nice second stage or in between stage rather than early implementation.

The reason they scrubbed the reference to bitcoin is because the add was through a recruitment agency and that made it too obvious who the employer was.

@_date: 2014-03-08 00:31:11
What Is Huntercoin?
Huntercoin is a new altcoin that released at the beginning of February to little fanfare. Huntercoin is based off of Namecoin and utilized a dual proof-of-work algorithm to process Huntercoin transactions with both SHA and Scrypt devices. Huntercoin is meant to be merged mined with other altcoins and should be immune to fluctuations in hardware efficiency.
That isn’t even the most interesting part about Huntercoin mining. Huntercoin blocks are 1 minute long, and every block releases 10 Huntercoins. 1 HUC goes to the miners each block, and 8.75 is distributed on the Huntercoin map. The remaining 0.25 HUC goes to whichever Hunter has the crown. The traditional mining scheme has been turned on its head by Huntercoin. For the first time since the earliest days of Bitcoin, any individual can mine meaningful amounts of crypto without dedicated hardware.
Furthermore, Huntercoin is the world’s first MMO game that is decentralized and cannot be taken down, or censored, by any government or rating agency.

Just Dice allowed anyone to anonymously invest money in a gambling operator and get their fair and equal share of the profit with no friction or barriers to entry!
Apparently this is unacceptable to lawmakers who insist only those with millions of dollars and political connections are allowed to benefit from the running of a gambling operation which they insure with exclusive or limited licensing. And if you think they are interested in protecting the players note that those government licensed or owned operators offer much worse than 1% house edge.
Personally I wish they kept operating despite the laws and used censorship resistant technology. There is now a big opportunity for the next, better service of this kind to be even more fun and innovative.

Wow, for me this is the death knell for any relevance or credibility the Bitcoin Foundation AND their international affiliates (I'm looking at you Australian Bitcoin Foundation) have.
I will tell any business who is member that it casts a bad shadow on them and makes me less likely to trust and do business with them. I am in the bitcoin gambling space and a lot of operators display their bitcoin foundation membership as a way to increase their perceived trustworthiness and legitimacy. They should know it does the opposite. 
if you have any credibility you would disassociate yourself with this bunch of clowns or at least insist on some major reforms, as long as you don't I am afraid you are in the same basket.

Anyway whatever you're wrong :)

They fit nicely on the side boxes and really stand out, being blue against the red bike. The bike is a head-turner here and combined with a foreigner riding it it gets a lot of attention.

You had to ask permission from 2 governments to go to everyone (that is what you were doing in the lines at the airports). There is a long list of places to which permission would have been denied.


Anything that has gone through a bank you had to ask permission from the banks to do it, anything international with banks you have had to ask permission from 2 governments and banks, anything over 10,000 is likely to have extra conditions.

The reward should go down incrementally, evenly and smoothly, every block should be worth a tiny tini bet less than the last giving the same overall halving ever ~4 years.

Great questions, my belief that bitcoin will take 5% of the gambling market stems from first hand experience of how awesome it is for gambling and how painful government currencies are from the customer and operators point of view as detailed in the page. The part about that happening in 2 years is my best guess.
Yes 3 Trillion is all gambling and it is necessarily a rubbery figure as most gambling is never recorded. Bitcoin integration in bricks and mortar casinos is next to nothing, a few casinos have bitcoin ATMs but that is it. That is one of the things I believe will change in the next 2 years.

Fantastic! I added it to my WP site, [here is what it looks like on a side bar with no adds]( and will rate it. Please consider 
* Making average the default default, most people don't like Mt Gox, their price is an outlier and they are not the biggest exchange so there is no good reason anyone should use them as a default.
* Having a "last" option showing the last price matched along with buy, sell, high, low and volume. I would like to only show last to save space.
* Where there is only one option (such as litecoin exchange or if the admin has set only to display average) there should not be an expandable drop down as there are no other choices to select.
Edit: dang it is causing a conflict with my drop down menus, see along the top menu "Bitcoin Sports Betting Guide" and "Blog" are supposed to be drop downs, they work fine when this plugin is not activated and don't work when it is. I will leave it up for a while for people to see what it looks like but I will have to take it down later and to other web masters who install it check your drop downs.

The mod of r/sportsbook even says he would want his payout pegged to fiat. I would hate if the payout of my bitcoin bets was pegged to fiat. I am making bets with bitcoin because I believe in it and value it more than fiat. I want to build my bitcoin bankroll and don't even consider the price in USDs.
I am also a professional sports bettor and made these reviews of the best bitcoin sportsbooks  Good luck!

Epic thoughts from AA
When you can choose currencies, currencies become a means of expression. In the past sovereignty created currency, in the future currency will create sovereignty. 
In the past authority of information came from the issuer of the information (ie new york times equaled authoritative information) now, because of the internet, authority of information comes from the quality or value of the content of the information.
In the past currency value came from the issuer (if it has an image of an old lady and the signature of a central banker it has value) Now, with crypto currency, the value comes from its attributes as money such as scarcity, divisibility, fungibility, transportability and utility.

I think their point is one of them will go broke. IF you keep betting for eternity to start with you have a 50% chance of doubling your money or going broke. Lets say you double your money. Now remember you keep betting for eternity so you have another 50% chance of doubling your money or going broke, you double your money again. keep betting for eternity = another 50% chance to double your money or go broke, eventually you will fall on the 50% chance to go broke side.

TL;DR 
The future of gambling is 0% house edge, provably fair and trustless. Easy to understand examples include roulette wheels with no 0 or slot machines that pay out 100% of the money they take in. 0% house edge means, on average if you bet randomly for long enough you will breakeven.
2 Trillion dollars is gambled every year in the current paradigm where the customers almost always lose. Imagine how much will be gambled when the customer gets just as much entertainment but can expect to break even and what this will do to the way society sees gambling.

Where was the warning statement from the German Central Bank to the people of Cyprus? But they feel compelled to warn me about bitcoin. Why does the Central Bank of Germany (or any other state monetary official) suddenly decide to get into the personal financial advisory game? What are their thoughts on my investing in Apple or Google stock?

It really is, I am a professional sports bettor and I was amazed when I discovered the [top bitcoin sportsbooks]( (link to reviews) because I was seeing the future of betting. These are the best sports betting experiences in the world and almost no one knows about them! They are sleek and modern and fully implement the bitcoin advantages 
* Free and instant deposits and withdraws of any amount 24/7
* The sportsbooks save so much money in transaction processing and charge backs that they can give you better odds.
* Betting anonymously makes it impossible for a sportsbook to limit you for winning too much or to sell your details and credit card information
* Betting anonymously makes it easier to avoid legal restrictions and tax burdens
This is especially big news to those in the United States because they have been excluded from every top sportsbook and betting exchange in the world, not any more amigos!

If you are a bitcoiner it’s safe to say the NSA and other government spying and information agencies might be interested. So are hackers, thieves and extortionists. VPNs are a good countermeasure.  
I’m sorry to say the “official” bitcoin black friday website is a clusterf**k where different VPNs are displayed under at least 4 different categories and there is no search function. There is also a list of black friday/cyber monday VPN deals at Best VPN but it does not identify which services accept bitcoin.
I have gathered them all here ordered by their review score on Best VPN. I am not affiliated with any of these brands, I was just looking for a bitcoin VPN deal myself and having done the research thought it could benefit others. I am constantly updating the list with the latest information. Happy browsing :)

This is law enforcement's next move, they will simply have to check all mail a lot closer than they do now. This will slow all mail down, no one cares if granny's Christmas card takes longer,send a FB message instead granny. The only establishment player to be negatively affected is online shopping shipments and the postal system will develop a fast lane for them. So it will be fast lane if you are dell or best buy and definatley don't contain drugs but a slow lane if you might contain drugs.

Bitcoin fails to meet the GST act definition of money/currency by ANY reasonable interpretation as it states issued by a nation. We know its money/currency and the ATO probably agrees but that is irrelevant to implementing the tax code.

In anything you write please emphasise how unimportant the government is to bitcoin and how it is impossible for any government to regulate bitcoin. If this is not clear ask 
What can any or all governments do to change bitcoin? 
Absolutely nothing.
Also Bitcoin is legitimate in itself. Nothing a government can say or do can make bitcoin more or less legitimate. The government is not an authority on bitcoin. If the IRS says bitcoin is a commodity, that does not make it a commodity, what the government says bitcoin is is not relevant.

The ATO will say they don't make the tax laws, they may well think its just as stupid as we all do.

I enabled 2FA then days later signed in, deposited fiat, bought and withdrew bitcoins multiple times and never had to enter my 2FA. 
Bank deposit took 5 business days to be credited because of their delays crediting it to my account (not delays in it getting to them).
No one has any idea what the "daily limits" are. there is conflicting information on the website, I have emailed them twice and each time got an answer that is different from that on the website and from the other email then I have actually done purchases and found the real limits in practise which are different again (so 5 different versions)

Just Dice allowed anyone to anonymously invest money in a gambling operator and get their fair and equal share of the profit with no friction or barriers to entry!
Apparently this is unacceptable to lawmakers who use exclusive or limited licensing to insure only those with millions of dollars and political connections are allowed to benefit from the running of a gambling operation. If you think they are interested in protecting the players note that those government licensed or owned operators offer much worse value to the player than Just Dices 1% house edge.
Personally I wish they kept operating despite the laws and used censorship resistant technology. There is now a big opportunity for the next, better service of this kind to be even more fun and innovative.

Its a question of how to securely reach consensus between 2 parties when an adversary can see/hear the communications between you.
The best explanation I heard for bitcoins solution is something like
Imagen paint that is easy to mix together but impossible to unmix. If you both have a secret color paint. Then one of you broadcast a different color to the other (you assume your adversary can listen/see). Then you both mix that color with your private color and send the mix to each other then you both mix the mix of the other persons private color and the publicly broadcasted color with your own secret color now both of you have the exact same color (a consensus) without ever having had communicated the color.

Hi James,
We already accept Bitcoin - the issue is that we don't have Cuba on our site as we had to agree to remove it to comply with paypal.
If you want to order online and pay with Bitcoin then email us that you'd like a different coffee, that would be fine... If you see what I mean. Cuba is £5/250g

I would like to see us go down to 2 minute blocks with 1/5 of the reward. This does not bloat the blockchain as much as you think as the transaction data is still the same apart from 4 more coinbase transactions and 4 more block headers every 10 minutes. Yes the miners have to do some more work, that is what they are there for! Definitely worth it for the improved confirmation times and tps capacity.
 The current 3tps X 20 (block size increas) X 5 (2 minute blocks) gives us 300 tps no worries.

So if you deposit 1 BTC 200% bonus is 2 BTC totaling 3 BTC x10 = 30 BTC rollover requirement.
2 is 6.6% of 30 and their sportsbooks overround was (I think) less than 6.6%, meaning they lose on the bonus.

We don't need some 30%-40% penetration rate to be achieving success. If bitcoin just gets popular in Metro Manila (good internet coverage) that is a population of 20 million right there.  
Point 1 and 2 are needed for adoption amongst the poor. The affluent will be first, that’s fine, the top 10% is a population of 10 million.  
Point 3 is already in place with 10% savings on remittance, other incentives include better online shopping and gambling.

website says


Each subsequent approved deposit will increase the limit by A$200 until the maximum daily limit of A$10,000 is reached.
It seems that might only apply to bank to bank transfers(not specified in that info) as when my personal page said deposit limit $2000 I generated 2 cash deposit notifications for $5000 each on separate days and was told by support 
"We have deposit limits of $5,000 in cash per day."
I then deposited 10K cash in one day.
Then the daily limits for buying bitcoin. I asked and was told by support
"Hi the limits is on deposit amounts. So you if you have 30k in your account you could buy that."
Then I tried to buy 10K worth and found a 5K limit was in place.
Then your own support pages has different information!
If you want to have limits they should be clear and consistent, not a different limit for cash deposits, bank to bank deposits and buying and selling bitcoins then different amounts for what it actually is and what support say then it goes up $200 every time you make a deposit but the support page says $100 but its different if verified or non verified for less than a week or more than a week nonsense.

Bitcoin Advantages For the Gambler
* Free and instant deposits and withdrawals of any amount 24/7
* Anonymity gives fast sign up and privacy for personal legal and tax reasons
* Better payouts due to operator cost savings. This will become [0% House Edge](
* [Provably Fair Gambling](  prevents rigged games by making it impossible for the casino to know or decide what the next card or number will be
Gambling is Good for Bitcoin and the Price
* The gambling industry pushes the envelope of technology and censorship resistance moving the bitcoin ecosystem forward
* Bitcoins price will increase due to gambling volume
* Bitcoin will take 2% of the gambling market within a year and 5% within 2 years
* 5% of $3 trillion is $150 billion, bitcoins current yearly transactions are $25 billion [see chart]( 25 goes into 150 6 times pointing to bitcoin price increase of 600% to $3000 within 2 years

There are no specific laws about gambling with bitcoin. The common sense approach is to assume if it is illegal with fiat its illegal with bitcoin and if its legal with fiat its legal with bitcoin. This is a non issue for the user as even with illegal fiat gambling the authorities only go after the operators not the individual customers.

We got one great question from the audience on bitcoin which referenced the lack of trust in the current system, advancements in technology and the growth of alternatives like kickstarter and peer to peer lending that remove the middle men.
In reply Ms Legared wheeled out the all too predictable " bitcoin is for money laundering derp" and even said it was suspicious. She let us know there needs to be a hierarchical centralised government at the heart of everything for it to be valid and worthy and safe from evil money launders. She did admit the current system was not perfect.

Does 10 minute blocks mean the average time you have to wait for a confirmation is 5 minutes because on average, if random, you will make the transaction half way between 2 blocks?
Therefore the average wait time on a 1 minute block is 30 seconds.  
@_date: 2015-05-04 02:19:11
I support this, Gavin needs to put his foot down for anything to get done other than endless drama queen dev squabbling.
Blocks are worryingly and increasingly full and while 20MB may not be a long term scalable solution it is a necessary band aid while those long term scalabel solutions are fleshing themselves out. 
I hope the hard fork would also be used to clean up and optmise the code in general.

Support for querying the UTXO set given an outpoint. This is useful for apps that use partial transactions, such as the Lighthouse crowdfunding app. The feature allows a client to check that a partial SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY transaction is correctly signed and by querying multiple nodes, build up some confidence that the output is not already spent.
Bitcoin XT is more experimental than Bitcoin Core, and has a strong emphasis on supporting the needs of app developers and merchants. By running it you not only provide additional services to the network but help build confidence in the implementations, contributing towards consensus for inclusion in a future version of Bitcoin Core.

What you say is just as logical in the opposite order. You saying fix malleability and quadratic hashing first then increase the blocksize. The other side is saying increase the blocksize first then fix malleability and quadratic hashing. Both get us to the same place.


That is not a solution to the blocksize debate, it just kicks the can down the road a bit and puts us back here when transaction reach the new limit. Better to have a solution where the block size can adapt to market demand rather than be central planned and hard coded.
It's hard to put this in the best way given I can't use certain keywords here and have the comment remain visable.

What are the market hours for the trading of OTCQX, OTCQB and OTC Pink securities?
Trading in OTCQX, OTCQB and OTC Pink securities may take place Monday-Friday from 6:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The majority of quoting and trading occurs between the open market hours of 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM (Eastern); however, market participants are free to quote and trade at any time as long as they comply with current regulations (e.g., FINRA Best Execution).

Just in the last few hours the odds on Pacman have come in and the odds on money have gone out meaning people give Manny a greater chance to win now than they have done throughout the build up.

Here is how my investments are tracking.

Did you ever consider it could be both?

This can not be accurate. the min bet is 1mbtc and the room did not exist last week. Everything you said is BS

This has lots of additional info, such as that KnC miner is behind it.

21 days in Thailand from Europe for 2000 euros seems like a good deal. Good luck with the bitcoin sales. Please keep some bitcoins in the business and offer to pay your staff, suppliers, contractors etc with bitcoin.


Buy paying for things without converting to local currency which can be confusing to spend when you have never used it before.


pay all the accommodation, transport and tour companies etcetera in bitcoin
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:57:19
Yes. The advantages of bitcoin gambling are clearly laid out, the current annual bitcoin transaction figure is from blockchain.info. Personally I have 7 years experience working in the gambling industry, as a professional bettor and for operators in 3 countries, I am a bitcoin gambling expert. See other comment about the 3 Trillion estimate....

@_date: 2015-05-30 02:49:29
More to the point 20mb max block size does not increase the size of blocks, only more transactions do that. So someone mining on software that allows 20 mb max block size will not necessarily have bigger blocks and most miners put their own soft limits on the size of their blocks anyway. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 23:40:12


Because we get paid in bitcoin and have all our savings in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:02:20
Its as good or better than any online casino I have ever seen and I am a professional gambler. So you get a casino as good as the best fiat operators but you get the bitcoin advantages of 
* Free and instant deposits and withdraws of any amount 24/7
* The betting operators save so much money in transaction processing and charge backs that they can give higher payouts
* Betting anonymously makes it impossible for a casino to limit you for winning too often or to sell your details and credit card information
* Betting anonymously makes it easier to avoid legal restrictions and tax burdens
Only 4 games to start of with (single 0 roulette, blackjack, baccarat and lottery) but it is literally 30 minutes old so I suspect they will add more soon. The games they do have have all the features and options like road map for backerate and a big range of bet types for lottery.
Min bet is 1 mBTC max is 400 mBTC on standard tables. your balance is displayed in mBTC.
The girls are attractive latinas, I would guess Costa Rican or Panamanian. They have pretty strong accents which I personally like.  
I will do a full review soon for now I just have a [review for cloudbet as a sportsbook]( which they are also VERY good at.
For me this cements cloudbet as THE leader in the bitcoin gambling industry good luck have fun

Why is circle a third party rather than a second party? For storage if I am the first party and circle is the third party who is the second party?
In a transaction where I (first party) send BTC to a sportsbook (second party) then yes circle would be the third party but in storage they are not right? 
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:07:49
I'm saying it seems more like a fuck up then a scam. Anyone who didn't lose bitcoin doesn't understand anyone who did is not able to look at it objectively. I don't even know the details just saying my impressions.

I made a [comparison chart]( of what the best bitcoin sportsbooks are offering on the super bowl. The column you would find most interesting is "Range of bets" which is just the number of different super bowl bet types they have. The bigger the number the more likely they are to have the prop you want.
This is my bread and butter so let me know if you have any questions :)

That's not the case,by controlling the max bet the house can be sure to roughly break even on the waging.


p2p gambling can be instant in the case where there is a 3rd party that runs the platform and hold customers funds but the betting itself is p2p. So the platform operator can offer p2p gambling between its customers.

* If you plug in that monitor, you will likely view some porn, and then you won't be sexual frustrated enough to talk to the girl at McDonalds, that would have become your wife. Sorry my friend, the downside of plugging in this monitor are potentially to great.
* Why should you get to have a monitor some developers I know don't have monitors, and that just wouldn't be fair!!
* I like to feel important and stuff, and being an obstacle to progress makes me feel important, so why don't you beg me to plug in the monitor or I'll make sure no one can use this monitor.

This^ They are not taking proceeds of crime and making it appear legitimate so it really should not be referred to as money laundering. 
They are attempting to conceal the source/destination of funds, which is one part of how money laundering (and tax evasion) could be done so if your finances are under as much scrutiny or Rogers better to stay away from it, especially as in this case there is no good reason to do it.

Since launching the [Bitcoin Betting Guide]( I have received 100% of my income in Bitcoin. Recently I hired a developer overseas and asked if he would accept payment in bitcoin. He agreed which is a huge win for us both as the minute his salary was due he got it instantly, with no fees or expenses, internationally! 
All business should be doing this especially those with staff overseas. To pay wages internationally via bank to bank transfer takes 4-5 business days, a fee of $25 and % loss on currency conversion. With a fiat remittance service it can be near instant but costs 5% of the transaction! Payroll manager’s minds are going to be blown all over the world when this catches on.
When someone asks how to get bitcoins please answer that the best way is to offer a good or service, such as your job, and accept bitcoin for payment.
I hired the developer to code bitcoins first [Odds Comparison Tables]( showing real time odds across several top bitcoin sportsbooks side by side so you can always find the best value for your bet. Because he is awesome and accepts 100% of his salary in bitcoin I asked him to manage all IT aspects of the site for a big raise. 
We are another bitcoin success story. Thanks Satoshi.

Right in sports betting the value is much more visible because the product you buy is a number (the odds) that is so easily comparable.

Manny is the underdog at 2.8. You bet 1 and if you win you get back 2.8 made up of your original 1 and 1.8 profit.
Floyd is the favorite at 1.4. You bet 1 and if you win you get back 1.4 made up of your original 1 and 0.4 profit.
And only 1 of the 2 bests can win...I wont go on because I am not sure if I understand your misunderstanding haha is that what you are getting at?

In the bitcoin dice investment model investors contribute funds to a site’s house bank that the players bet against with the odds in the house’s favor. If the house wins investors win! We explain the model in detail [here](
While this sounds great it gives the site operator the incentive and opportunity to scam investors in a number of ways such as exit scams and underpaying investors. 
There must be a way to make a bitcoin dice site trustless with multi-sig transaction, smart contracts, open source code et cetera but no one has done it yet.

On the 1st of October 2014 we invested ฿1 in the house bank of the top 9 bitcoin gambling investments sites. We will report and compare the performance of those investments as well as a key site stat that you won’t find anywhere else. Expected annual return based on the investors edge and how often the house bank is turned over. How many times the bank is turned over per year multiplied by the edge is the expected anal return.
Numbers are still a bit all over the place as its less than a month old but we will update the figures at least every week and the comparison will get more valuable over time. Here is the table
We have also reviewed the operators here.
It still amateur hour out there i'm afraid, most sites leave something to be desired and most operators don't even reply when contacted. But I do love the house bank investment model and believe the industry will mature and the game changer will be a trustless implementation on the blockchain via a smart contracts... or something.

These are my first odds comparison tables and we are the first website to do this for bitcoiners.

The vast majority of gambling is still in person rather than online and most of it is done in Asia. However bitcoin solves most of the problems that have held back online gambling, which is simply money in money out and anonymity.

The existing regulations should just be applied to bitcoin like they are to every other currency. More than enough regulations are already in place, there is no need for special bitcoin regulations.

Thats interesting, social gaming sites generally are not but I don't think it is because the operator does not profit from wagers but rather that the players do not make any wagers at all.
Remember the laws against online gambling do not exist for the interests of consumers but rather they exist to protect government owned or government licenced incumbents, who generally offer inferior product and payouts! 
From that point of view if the "unlicensed" operator takes 0% house edge or whatever does not make a difference, they are competing without operating in the states system (giving the state a cut and letting the state tell them what to do like collect customer IDs).

The article does say currencies are not at true value but it does not explain that at all. How can that make sense? its not at "true value" because of what? Government interference? 
The entire currency and its existence is government interference. It is created, issued, suply managed, traded et cetera by and for the government. So how does government interference take it off true value?

Strategy. I suspect it's because anyone in the US who is interested in bitcoin will come across coinbase by google and other bitcoiners so at the moment they don't need to increase their profile.
Also they might be experiencing exponential growth without it so it's nice to keep it as a card up their sleeve to use if/when their exponential growth ever slows down.

put a big pile of sugar next to an ant hill and let the ants get into it. Then put up a half ass little wall with holes in it between the ants and the sugar. See whether the ants are still getting into the sugar. 


There are no laws against that and it is what most Chinese exchanges have done when getting started. It is official that banks cant deal in actual bitcoins and there is a rumor that the central bank asked 10 3rd party payment providers to stop processing payments to btc exchanges. Yes the rumor appears to be true but there was no official statement, advise or law about that so it is a fluid and flexible situation.

Only if you can broadcast a block of the right size when there is a 50/50 split on both sides of that size. 
If 20% of miners were accepting 1 mb and 80% were accepting 1.1 mb there is no way to split that.
@_date: 2017-03-03 21:53:40
They are bitcoin companies, they have to be prepared for what looked like a likely protocol change. It does not mean they are happy with it or think it's the best scaling solution.
If 8mb blocks had us much momentum behind it as segwit once did they would have prepared for that as well.

Did you see the comparison in the link of the amount of information required to sign up to an end-to-end bitcoin sportsbook compared to a government currency sportsbook that accepts bitcoin?
Did you see in the link how government currency sportsbooks that accept bitcoin have minimum deposits and withdrawals that do not exist in end-to-end bitcoin sportsbooks?
Did you see in the link that government currency sportsbooks take days to process withdrawals compared to minutes or hours for end-to-end bitcoin sportsbooks?
Are you aware of any government currency casino that offer provably fair gambling?
@_date: 2016-01-09 10:59:50
Sounds like you are looking for casino in which case [BitCasino]( is indeed excellent if you are not in the USA, if you are in the USA [Cloudbet]( (also has sports) and [BitStarz]( are great.
Detailed video and written reviews here   
For other types of gambling like sports betting poker and dice you can't beat [Nitrogen](

or free email. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 00:24:59
The video does not show any funds leaving the players balance and in the first thread about this [Cloudbet said](


I understand the player is disappointed here but the bet was not ever placed. Similarly, had banker won (and player lost), no funds would have been deducted either.
After that, in this video the player repeats exactly the behavior that Cloudbet told him would result in the bet not being placed, making the wager while the dealer was shuffling, so in this case the 3 chips never left his balance and he can not win or loose whatever happens. And he deliberately started this video after placing chips on the table so we could not see that the chips never left his balance. 
So it seems OP has found a bug, that while the dealer is shuffling bets appear on the table but are not deducted from the account, therefore the bet is not on. This is supported by the [OPs reply to the above]( He never says the chips left his balance. The [Ask gamblers resolution]( says the same.
For bringing this bug to Cloudbets attention and for the bad experiance they paid OP 1 bitcoin. That is fair enough but OP is trying to use this to get 


which is unreasonable and in this attempt to get more money the OP is dishonestly attempting to ruin the reputation of a good bitcoin business. Cloudbet are not perfect, I have had a couple of frustrating experiences but I have found them a good quality and honest operator.

He does not have consensus to make the change on bitcoin core so he is going to try it on a different version, xt. People can already choose xt or core. Mostly likely outcome is that the change goes well on XT and gets brought into core.  
@_date: 2015-05-09 22:36:53
So if we get another spike in usage before march 2016, which most people think we will, then we're screwed. I think since March 2016 is already out there it should be considered the latest the changes can possibly be made but if Gavin thinks he has enough consensus before then they should be made ASAP.   
This is a test for the ability of bitcoin to improve over time which should be a selling point. If we get burned here a lot of confidence will be lost, I know mine will.

Gambling laws are generally written with as broad language as possible in regard to what is being bet, they use terms like "money, money like consideration, things with monetary value including money substitutes." Or else anyone could legally run a casino from home with casino chips instead of USD.


If you get the relevant gambling licenses and get permission from the licensing authorities, then yes. If not then no.
The relevant gambling licenses cost millions and take years and the issuing authorities are unlikely to allow an operator to accept bitcoin.
So basically no, not going to happen, more info here
Now just because something is illegal does not mean you should not do it. I think bitcoin gambling is safe, fun and awesome. I say go for it, but it wont be legal.

I don't see it. They do come after people for breaking the spirit of law. Then good luck defending yourself in the rigged justice system where the prosecutors and the judges are on the same payroll.
Or if it's a really good loophole (which this is not) they change the law to be able to take you down like they are doing with fantasy sports now. 
Most unlicenced in person gambling is also illegal in the US so even if UIGEA did not apply other anit gambling laws would.


I don't, I think the regulations specifically exist to to deny people the flexibility (freedom) they want and the regulations push out the best operators leaving people (who will gamble anyway) having to use the worst operators so they do harm not good for average users.
The regulations exist to protect government monopoly (or monopoly licensed operators) and incumbents. Not to help people or make the situation better as a whole.
Bitcoin does provide the solution to this which is offering better and safer online betting, it is usually not legal for the operator. I think that is less important than the fact it's a better product for the user.

Good questions, there is full detail with examples about all that here
Short version


For the example in the above comment, there are 2 ways the markets could be set up.
1. Each contract is worth a fraction of the price of bitcoin if that BIP is activated. So if you set it to 1% of the price of bitcoin and the price is $4000 then each contract is worth $4.
2. You set a min and max value like $0 - $100,000. Then make each contract worth $0.00 - $1 depending on where the value is between the min and max, so if the value of bitcoin is $4000, the contract is worth $0.04c


The better proposals contract trades at a higher price.


I dont believe in compulsion. These markets would be run to make recommendations for what decision to implement. Nodes, particularly miners, signaling preferences and running code would still be the way decisions are implemented.
As the decision market’s recommendations prove to be good, over time they would become increasingly followed and relied upon.

Would it be more true if the current segwit soft fork proposal is not activated? Would it be more true if that and the next 5 soft folks proposals from core to improve bitcoin, including on privacy, do not activate? 
Because that is what is probably going to happen with the current state of bitcoin development. 
I am not a Hern fan but on scaling he is being proven correct.


The important distinction is it would share the block history of bitcoin up to the fork so bitcoin holders would be whole on both forks. An alt-bitcoin if you will.
I am not harassing anyone. But on that note this could be a way to amicably resolve a lot of hostility and division in bitcoin.

This is a devil’s advocate argument for the purpose of discussion. 
There is no compromise for major change to bitcoin that 95% of the network will agree to. Bitcoin core is partly ossified. 
The only way to make meaningful improvements is to hard fork with the full acceptance that after the hard fork there will be 2 separate networks with different rules.

I did a real life experiment which showed, on average, you lose money in these investments due to the prevalence of exit scams.
I invest ฿1 in the house bank of the top 9 bitcoin gambling investments sites and tracked the investments and key site stats here
13 months after our investment we stopped the comparison, these were the results.
* 3 sites stole our full investment in exit scams.
* 1 site closed and returned our investment.
* 1 site stopped offering investment.
* 1 site was for sale.
* 1 site had no turnover.
* 2 sites were operating normally but giving very small returns.
We lost 32% of our investment overall.

I see I minor temporary problem that probably has solutions, not a major problem. 
Let's say one fork has 1/3 of the hashing power so blocks take 30 minutes for the first 2 week then back to normal. On the 2/3 chain blocks take 20 minutes for 2 weeks then back to normal. Hardly unusable.
And the new fork could probably have some code that would mitigate that. Or the manual way could be for the forkers to take their hashing power offline for the preceding difficulty period making difficulty go down.

YESTERDAY by: Wolfgang Münchau
After Brexit and Donald Trump, prepare for the return of the eurozone crisis. If Matteo Renzi, Italian prime minister, loses his constitutional referendum on December 4, I would expect a sequence of events that would raise questions of Italy’s participation in the eurozone.
The underlying causes of this extremely disturbing possibility have nothing to do with the referendum itself. The most important was Italy’s economic performance since it adopted the euro in 1999. Total factor productivity, the portion of economic output not explained by labour and capital, has fallen in Italy by about 5 per cent since then whereas in Germany and France it went up by about 10 per cent.
The second source was the failure by the EU to construct a proper economic and banking union after the eurozone crisis of 2010-2012 and to impose austerity instead. If you want to know why Angela Merkel cannot be the leader of the free world, look no further. The German chancellor could not even lead Europe when it mattered.
The combination of those two factors are the biggest causes for the incremental rise in populism in Europe. Italy has three opposition parties, all of which favour exiting the euro. The largest and most important is the Five Star Movement, a party that defies the usual left-right classification. The second is Forza Italia, Silvio Berlusconi’s party, which has turned rabidly anti-euro after the former prime minister was forced out of office in 2011. And the third is the separatist Lega Nord. In democratic countries, it is common that opposition parties eventually come to power. Expect that to happen in Italy too.
The referendum matters as it could accelerate the path towards euro exit. If Mr Renzi loses, he has said he would resign, leading to political chaos. Investors might conclude the game is up. On December 5, Europe could wake up to an immediate threat of disintegration.
In France, the probability of a presidential election victory by Marine Le Pen is no longer a remote risk. Of all the candidates that have declared, she is the best prepared. There are some who could beat her, like Emmanuel Macron, the former reformist economics minister, who declared his candidacy on Wednesday. But he may not make it to the final round of the elections as he lacks a party apparatus. If Ms Le Pen became president, she has promised to hold a referendum on France’s future in the EU. If that referendum were to lead to Frexit, the EU would be finished the next morning. So would the euro.
Related article
Political populism: Is Italy next?
A rejection of Renzi’s reform plans in a referendum risks toppling the government
 
A French or Italian exit from the euro would bring about the biggest default in history. Foreign holders of Italian or French euro-denominated debt would be paid in the equivalents of lira or French francs. Both would devalue. Since banks do not have to hold capital against their holdings of government bonds, the losses would force many continental banks into immediate bankruptcy. Germany would then realise a massive current account surplus also has its downsides. There is a lot of German wealth waiting to be defaulted on.
Can this be prevented? In theory it can, but it would require a series of decisions taken in time and in the right sequence. For starters, Ms Merkel would have to accept what she refused in 2012 — a road map towards a full fiscal and political union. The EU would also need to strengthen the European Stability Mechanism, the rescue umbrella, which is not designed to handle countries the size of Italy or France.
Is this even remotely likely? Think about it this way: if you ask the German chancellor whether she wants commonly-backed eurozone bonds, she will tell you no. But if she has to choose between eurobonds and an Italian exit from the euro, her response may well be different. The answer will also depend on whether you ask before or after the German elections next autumn.
My central expectation, however, remains not a collapse of the EU and the euro, but a departure of one or more countries, possibly Italy, but not France. In the light of recent events, my baseline scenario is now firmly on the optimistic scale of reasonable expectations.

Weather Gemini can see the money came from a gambling site depends on how good that gambling site is at using new addresses for all transactions (deposits, withdrawals and internal transactions at the site).
To be extra safe you may as well send the funds from the gambling site to a new address on your own wallet, then send from your own wallet to Gemini.
Personal I think you should keep it in your own wallet as an investment or see what cool stuff you can do with it rather than sell it for government currency.

What is BetKings yearly profit? 
What value is Dean putting on BetKing? 
the multiplier is a good indication of over/under/fair value.
Be aware Dean was trying to sell the site a while back, I think he tried to sell it multiple times and failed. That could indicate
1. He does not want to keep running the site. Do you want to invest in a site run by someone who might not want to run it?
2. He thinks it worth more than it is. Do you want to invest in an ICO set up by someone who overvalued the asset (meaning your investment would be undervalued).
Betking has proven it is capable of running a popular dice game with house investment. Their attempts at casino and sportsbetting have been of a poor quality, bellow the best of the competition. 
Dean has shown to be hard to get along with, a lot of people who have dealt with him don't like him. IMHO Dean is not a bad person but he rubs people the wrong way.
I dont think Dean will steal any investors money, I think he will run the ICO honestly. I also have 0 interest in investing and would advise anyone who asked not to.

You see what you stated is not an indicator because there is no way to see if it's the case or not. So that question remains unanswered.   
Even if there was a way to see that a transaction was as you described, you have made a moral judgement about that transaction. Do we want to treat transactions differently based on moral judgements?

TL;DR      


From 2009 to 2011 bitcoin was largely ignored.        


In 2012 and 2013 bitcoin was laughed at, mainstream media video examples inside


This is happening now
**Who**  
Most of the banking and financial system and most branches of government.
**Why**   
Bitcoin undermines their power and ability to extract wealth from people. 
**How**   
* Manipulating public opinion against bitcoin through the media
* Anti-bitcoin laws
* Dividing the community
* Improving the legacy system


There does not have to be a winner and loser, bitcoin can continue to be successful alongside the legacy monetary system. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 21:03:02


No, what you want is end to end bitcoin, which means bitcoin transactions AND having your account denominated in bitcoin not converted to government currency.

App pays out winners with 100% of loser’s bets as per the [parimutuel betting model]( giving, on average, the best odds in the world with 0% house edge.
App can be open sourced and the operators can make money as per [this post.](

No I want Gavin to take control of core and implement a block size increas. 
@_date: 2019-04-24 07:42:48
I thought since the average block time is 10 minutes, if I made a transaction at a random time the next block would be, on average, 5 minutes away.  
I gathered the data and it turns out I was wrong. Basically because there are long block intervals and short block intervals, your transaction made at a random time is more likely to be made in a long block interval, because they are longer.

I am more interested in the higher level question of why do these laws exist because its certainly not to help or protect the customers. 
Basically I think it comes down to control and taxation. 
Governments are megalomaniac and want to be able to control what we do with our money, who we trade with and what we trade.
Government want to know about all transactions so they can tax as many of them as possible.

In answer to your question that pretty much works, the sites wont like you doing it, especially if you don't actually gamble with them at all. You are adding a counterparty risk.

You are incorrectly assuming gambling laws only apply to gambling with government currency. Most gambling laws are deliberately more general than that and use concepts like " the possibility of material loss and material gain" or "money and items with monetary value".
This is intentional to stop loopholes like gambling for gift cards or points that can be redeemed for items with monetary value.
Anyway to answer the question If the type of gambling you are doing is illegal with government currency then it's most likely illegal with bitcoin. If the type gambling you are doing is legal with government currency then it's most likely legal with bitcoin.
The individual gambler has nothing to worry about. No one is going to go after gamblers. The casino operators have a lot to worry about, authorities do go after casino operators.

Since you already know what bet you want to make, unders, you should [compare the odds]( at all the top bitcoin sportsbooks.
You see [fairlay]( has the best odds on under 44 points. However since you should care about more than just the odds also take into account that sportsbook's [review score](
If you consider the odds and the overall quality and trustworthiness of the operator and everything all together the best option is [Nitrogen](

You should only use end-to-end crypto sportsbooks, not fiat sportsbooks that accept crypto.
Full details here [ but the main points relevant to you is
* Bet in crypto amounts not converted to fiat.
* Fully anonymous with no KYC.
* Easy withdrawals.
Crypto gambling is a game changer but you have to do it with a site that does it right, not a fiat site like Bodog.

Online payments is the most exciting thing in cryptocurrency because it is ready to go mainstream now. When I use bitcoin to pay my freelancer overseas I am doing it because it is better/faster/cheaper than fiat currency alternatives like credit cards, PayPal and bank transfers.
And people looking to make online payments are ready for bitcoin. People are ready for a better way send money overseas, people are ready to transact without banks.
After bitcoin 1.0 payment activity is normal and widespread society will be ready for bitcoin 2.0 apps. All those things that get us so excited like decentralized prediction markets and maidsafe will never get traction until bitcoin has proven itself to the masses with good online payments.

Are you familiar with the scaling debate a few years back? The developers who maintain bitcoin core decided not to allow enough transactions for bitcoin to be usable as a currency for payments. The result was bitcoin going from 97% of crypto market cap to 52% (and splitting into 2 chains, one of which was Bitcoin Cash).

1. 6 cents is too high.

You state things which may be true for you as if they are universally true for all. Your description of the psychology of gambling is not in accordance with the accepted academic theories or with my experience.


No they dont, at the height of satoshi dice, which did all betting on the blockchain, it was estimated at about 50%


In other words bitcoin has nothing to do with it, you have an addictive personality and if it was not bitcoin gambling that you used to go on the "cycle of destruction" as you say, it would have been something else.


Maybe it was different for you but generally the gamblers high is not experiance at the moments of win and lose but rather during the time of risk. In the game of roulette for example, the component that gamblers crave is the time when they have got there bet down and the ball is spinning and bouncing around the wheel, the outcome is unknown, it's the risk that hooks people not the winning or losing.


Degenerate gambler often subconsciously want to lose but not so they can experience the rushing of winning it back as you suggest. Rather it is to punish themselves out of guilt. They might subconsciously feel that they deserve to be miserable so engage in self destructive behavior.

BTC Markets is the biggest bitcoin exchange in Australia. After I deposited bitcoin and traded it for government currency they gave me no way to withdraw and did not respond to repeated contacts.
After weeks of my money being in limbo my only real choice was to trade it back to bitcoin and withdraw that, resulting in $456 AUD of trading fees which I am asking BTC Markets to return to my account.
As per their comment in the link BTC Markets have refunded me the trading fees and its seems users can now update their own bank account details.

My url policy has been to be very literal and consistent they are simply 
 
(no all pages have a category) that makes for some long urls with repeated words and words that do not contribute to SEO. When I was reading about it at the time it was said 


it sounded more like fashion than tech so I choose to ignore it and take the literal approach, I am not trying trick anyone anyway....

Oh Bitcoin gambling wont work because of volatility, how original (vomit), and wrong. People who wright these things are not bitcoiners
For the last 5 years bitcoin gambling has been one of the fastest growing and most successful parts of the gambling industry and the bitcoin industry.
Bitcoin volatility is not a problem for gambling for a number of reasons. 
* The vast majority of gamblers do it for fun with no expectation of increasing their wealth.
* Any bitcoiners to whom the above does not apply want to increase their bitcoin holdings.
* Bitcoiners have already come to terms with and accept the volatility.
* Most bitcoiners are believers who think the price is more likeley to go up and the USD drops 3% per year anyway
* The volatility is reducing over time and will continue to reducing meaning this fake issue will not even be useful as a fake issue soon enough.

But If I want full bitcoin or dollar amounts I dont know how to mentaly convert to them from bits, so I would have to

so its easier to just start at mBTC

As per 
* Global and unrestricted, all players are welcome no matter where they are
* Free and instant deposits and withdrawals of any amount 24/7
* Sportsbooks save so much money in transaction processing, chargebacks, know your customer and anti money laundering that they can give better odds
* Betting anonymously makes it    
– impossible for a sportsbook to limit you for winning too much      
– impossible for a sportsbook to sell, misuse or have stolen your details and credit card information     
– easier to avoid legal restrictions and taxation

RadioShack used to collect customers personal information, their own privacy policie and signage said “We pride ourselves on not selling our private mailing list.”
Now they are selling it. 
The solution is not that centralized services like radioshack should not do bad things like this. That is never going to happen, not with gov regulation or market forces. The solution is to make it impossible through decentralization. 
My point has nothing to do with RadioShack rather the inherent superiority of decentralized services as they do not collect any such data and can not be sold.

This article states [Betcoin Poker's]( biggest advantage, large tournament player pool, but does not explain it. The reason Betcoin has all those tournaments available is because they are a white label on the Winning Poker Network. 99% of players in Betcoin tournaments are members at different government currency poker rooms. This advantage is limited to tournaments as they do not share player pools for ring games yet. 
The other big advantage is that the Winning Poker network software is much better than anything Betcoin could build in house, its quite nice.

Book readers used to hold that sentiment about anything written in news pappers, then news paper readers used to hold that sentiment about anything written on the internet. 
Please consider the merits of the content not the platform. 
Not that  I conced there is anything wrong with the Bitcoin Betting Guide as a platform, its mostly about bitcoin sports betting but also has a blog which includes a related category about [sports]( and a related category about [bitcoin]( which is my greatest passion. 
Okay you might see a bitcoin sports betting add. What if I got the article to a nice looking domain like dailymail.co.uk most people would rather see a bitcoin sports betting add then the awful tabloid celebrity and self obsession click bait that crowds out the content on that crap site.

Thanks, I pretty much agree with this sentiment, pseudonymous, makes perfect sense to me and could be more appropriate on this page (I might even change it which will make this thread seem strange) but I disagree that pseudo anonymous is not correct and does not mean anything. 
you can put pseudo in front of most adjectives and it means 


which could be said about bitcoin anonymity the way most people us it, like from a coinbase account or from a blockchain.info account that does not generate new address. So it seems to me that bitcoin is both 
pseudonymous    
and   
pseudo anonymous  
which is pretty confusing and for some people (like futilerebel) will be pretty frustrating.

That would not be provably fair as the site provided the hash and therefor the site decided what would be dealt. To avoid this the site lets the user provide a seed which modifies the hash and therefore the deal. After the deal the site shows the user 
the original hash   
what would have been the original deal  
the seed that modified the hash   
the final deal 
And the user can verify that the original deal was modified in accordance with the seed the user provided that the site could not have predicted. Therefore the site could not have decided the deal or known what would be dealt.
This page explains it well in text and video. 
Important: a provably fair operator can still rip you off in other ways
Interesting: This is all independent of bitcoin, a government currency site could implement it just as easily

No the spread is 2% so if you did a full loop AUD - BTC -  AUD you would loose 2% if you do half the loop AUD - BTC you lose half of the spread.
Actually that is not the right way to think of it, here is a better way. The fair price is half way between the buy and sell price, that would be the price if there was no spread. If the difference between the buy and sell price is 2% and you are just buying or selling the price you get is 1% worse than the price half way between the buy and sell price.

So for example average Joe wants to exploit those in poorer, less powerful societies in order to improve the quality of life in his society at the expense of others.
Having a central government to do this for him allows him to feel detached from it with no moral responsibility for it. 
He can even go so far as to say he does not like that his government does this and he wishes other people were not exploited to improve his quality of life but there is nothing he can do about it. 
Although it is done with his taxes, he does not like paying taxes and he can tell himself they are mostly for health, education et cetera.
Give him the option to opt out of this with bitcoin and he will be defensive as he knows the exploitation of others performed by his government with his taxes is actually working well for him and his society while allowing him not to feel responsible and that is  how he wants it.

The top few are not just trustworthy but all round great operators and lot more entertaining than the dice sites you mention. 
If the operator is honest this is a great case in favor of provably fair gambling that had not occurred to me yet. Operators can use provably fair to make sure they are not being cheated by a hacker or exploit.

Ryan X. Charles, who is one of the worlds leading cryptocurrency engineers said on Lets talk Bitcoin that the thing he is most excited about in the cryptocurrency space is Bitcoin 1.0; payments. I agree because people are ready for a better way to pay for things and transact.

Protesting and voting does not bring change even if you get new politicians. This is because it does not change the incentives that are place which cause politicians to do what they do.
For real change don’t vote, pay taxes or use banks and government currency. Rather than fight the system, ignore and bypass the system. 
Preferring bitcoin to the government currency undermines the system in the most fundamental and all-encompassing way. It damages the government's ability to print and borrow wealth, which they rely on to exist in their bloated form.

Alot of people Identify this as bitcoins most obvious big opportunity as its is where the current system has the most friction and contrasts the most against bitcoins advantages. 
The challenge is the target market is amongst the least tech savvy and financial savvy demographic in the world. Particularly the receivers who are poor and usually the older generation. So we need much more accessible on and off ramps and services for them if they are to be direct bitcoin users. 
Alternatively if someone opens a western union copy that uses bitcoins to move the value then pays out in local currency, or if western union did that itself all you could really do is lower the fees a bit. Still a good start I guess while direct bitcoin usage slowly propagates toward the ultimate end game.
What we want is for the foreigner worker to get paid in bitcoins and her family back home to buy food and pay bills with bitcoin. Only then are all the current points of friction eliminated and the full advantages of bitcoin realised. This would put more than 50 Billion dollars a year in the hands of the poor instead of financial institutions.

That means those rights are denied or not guaranteed for non citizens. Therefore citizenship is discrimination against non citizens. Why should we have different rights in different geographical coordinates relative to where we were born which has nothing to do with anything.
I would like to see counties not allowed to have armies or enact any law that restricts the flow of people, legal goods and money. And most importantly have to treat all people in their territory equally no matter where they were born or what permission documents they have which means we should end citizenship.

I believe the hearings will be negative overall and that will have a short term negative impact on the price of bitcoins. The hearings will start to negatively affect the price (that does not mean the price goes down as there are many factors that contribute to the price, I am just discussing the effect that this one factor will have) just before the start of the hearings, let’s say from 9:00 that morning and continue for 48 hours (the life of a news story) after the findings or recommendations are released or if they are not going to release anything 48 hours after the hearing closes.

Citizenship is a way for people to deny other people rights that they themselves enjoy based on geographical coordinates of birth in relation to geographical coordinates of imaginary, arbitrary lines on maps.

The main deciding factor here will be how bitpay and coinbase have planed for it as most of the trade will go through them, they might have been stockpiling bernakecoins for the last week so when traders want to turn bitcoins into $ they have enough and wont have to go out and get more on the exchanges.

I can't believe your the only poster of about 20 people to say that. Obviously the first thing to do would be to find out the reason.

Bitcoins allow any 2 people to transact almost free and instantly, anytime, anywhere online with no third parties such as banks or governments involved. Sending someone money is as quick and easy as sending an email
Compare that to the current financial system where remittances are charged 10-15%, credit cards 3%, international bank transfers take 5 business days, banks charge for using other banks ATMs, there are towns where you are not allowed to do business on Sunday and the government devalues your fiat currency 3% per year!

It's sick how much better betting at bitcoin sportsbooks is. Transactions are so fast and odds are so good because the sportsbook saves money on payment processing, charge backs and account verification.
At fiat sportsbooks it takes ages to set up, verify and fund an account and there are almost no good options for Americans. At these bitcoin places you just set a username and password, deposit anything from a 0.0001 to 10000 bitcoins almost free and instantly and you’re on! No names or address or sending in ID. 
The second one down on this page takes it to the max, just by visiting the site you are issued with a bitcoin address to deposit into, you could deposit &gt; bet &gt; withdraw with a new “account” every time you visit without even nominating a username!
I know a lot of serious sports bettors as I used to work in the industry and almost none of them know about these places, when they find out they will put some serious volume through them and its all good for the bitcoin economy.
This is the future of gambling, gambling will be good for bitcoin and bitcoin will be good for gambling, especially in places where it is banned like the land of the free.

I think we need to know if the chinese btc/mbtc/satoshi comunity has a preferance about changing the standard denomination we refer to from bitcoin which = ~ 5000 units of their currency the Chinese Yuan.
mbtc = ~ 5 CNY

Not so because the litecoin hashing algorithm suites CPUs and GPUs not ASIC and "supercomputer" arms race type equipment that is what makes mining so expensive and therefore requires high transaction fees to pay the miners.

You are thinking of bitcoin too narrowly. Bitcoins is a currency, a payment processor, a technology, a store of value, a unit of account and an investment. That is what the economists you are listening to have not grasped. They are applying logic from instruments they understand, such as gold and shares that are only 1 or 2 of those things, they have never seen something like bitcoin before so at they moment they don't understand its potential.

Yes that site is very popular around here. You can see why, it lets you know the USD price on Gox the CNY price on BTC China, the price on bitstamp. I am in Australia and it even takes into account 4 AUD exchanges. 
The best thing is that its a weighted average. BTW the average never got to $1200 USD only Mt gox did.


I also wonder! I hope someone can answer here. 
Funny I am having this discussion as I think you guys in the media are way to fixated on the price and miss the more important elements of bitcoin. I would love it if when they ask you today "So Mat the price has really gone down overnight, how do you feel about you $800 now" You would say words to the effect of "I could not care less, the price at any given second is not the point at all, but if you do care about the price just check the long and medium term trend." 
Look forward to seeing your segments mate.

So you can gamble while you gamble, double gambling for the win! But what I am trying to say is that what makes bitcoin good for gambling also makes it good for a lot of other things that would benefit from reduced friction and costs especially in the getting started phase. That could include stock broking and all kinds of investing, online porn, anything that is account based I guess.

I have 3 short term issues we would overcome but will have a negative impact on the price and 1 long term issue. 
**The** core devs not fixing the transaction per second limit before it is reached and the media and bitcoin detractors latch onto it as proof that "bitcoin is not a real currency" and thus destroying bitcoins reputation with merchants and the public que price crash. 
this is not a long term problem because the issue would eventually get fixed.  
**Parts** of the established banking, financial and payment system making a concerted effort to block and discredit bitcoin.
This would not be a long term problem because they would be replaced by bitcoin but they can do damage with their dying kicks.  
**Simultaneous** failures of major bitcoin support companies such as Gox, bitstap, coinbase and bitpay. If they all fell due to sovereign risk, mismanagement, hacking, fraud whatever at the same time confidence would be lost and the price would crash.
This is not a long term problem because better companies will replace them.  
This is long term one
**National** or transnational government launching digital currencies of their own with most of the advantages of bitcoin that would be the only currency the governments do business and accept taxes in.

This may be a reasonable response to the technical issue but there is a marketing and public relations issue that would affect the uptake and price a lot more. The MSM would have a field day with this and the message would go out to potential merchants any time there are more than 7 transactions per second the system will underperform and you will have to pay high fees. They will say no thanks and the media would actually be right when they say "bitcoin is not a real currency"

This is urgent, we now have blocks that are more the 40% of the capacity. If the devs don't address this soon the media is going to have a field day and bitcoins reputation among merchants will be shot.  
One of the things that made me decide to buy bitcoins was that it is dynamic and changeable so it can be improved over time.
When I heard about the 7 transactions per second limit that is exactly what I fell back on. But now I see the community and that devs have been aware of this impending problem for several months and are still umming and arghing about it. Some people say “it’s not a problem yet”. That is the point! Fix it before it becomes a problem not when it becomes a problem and destroys bitcoins reputation and price. Bitcoin proponents are soon going to get hold of this and start squawking it as a reason bitcoin can never be a “real currency” and if we don't change it they are right.
Visa or Western Union peak usage periods are hundreds of times greater than average usage. What will the peak be on bitcoin black Friday? We can go 2 and half times greater than that block before we're fucked. the media coverage would put us back a year and rightly so. Is there something we can do to encourage the deves to resolve this ASAP?
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:37:30


at which time it is not income tax it is capital gains tax. So the rules for income tax are the same and the rules for capital gains tax are the same. If you were paid in $ you would bet income taxed, if you then bought BTC and they went up when you cash out you would get capital gain taxed so the gov double taxes you there just as much as they do in the case you describe. 
Like I said Bitcoins will require some new tax protocols and clarifications but nothing changes fundamental.

They could disappear with your bitcoins but only as much as a fiat sportsbook could disappear with your fiat. Being such great places to bet they will make more money by just operating normally. There is some more thoughts about it here.

I would say he is not naming them because its a fake story from the brigade of bitcoin haters have have descended on this sub in the last few days.

That is a fuckin great idea! 
I spend 16 mbtc at subway and as soon as the transaction is complete my wallet buys 16 mbtc from my fiat funds allowing me to have used bitcoin but not lost any bitcoin or sacrificed any future value rise.
Honestly you should tweet that to coinbase and blockchain.info and all the payment wallets, you should probably make a seperate redit post about it. I nominate you for the first ever Satoshi Award.

my concern is the opposite. I imagine the next growth faze of bitcoin will be because companies provide support services to non technical people to make it easier and more secure to transact in btc.  
My concern is that something like litecoin is soooooo similar to bitcoin we could see the best of those products be compatible with both, so the best bitcoin support products that everyone will use will labled virtual currency products supporting bitcoin, litecoin etceter rather than just being bitcoin support products. This would make the two equally legitimate in many buyers eyes and they get to choose between 1 bitcoin for $1000 or 100 litcoins for $1000, they will go for the litecoin. Then there is all the specific mining computing power out there which can no longer mine btc profitably but can do so for litecoins. 
Anyway I cant think how to stop that without doing something evil like apple would do

Way of the mark mate. China's economy WAS heavily export-focused. The government wants to transition that to a domestic consumption model like the USA had in the 50s and 60s.
The Chiniese government neutral stance on bitcoins is because
* They realise they could not stop it if they tried 
* The enemy of my enemy is my friend
* They see some of the same efficiency and other advantage in it we all do.

I believe the hearings will be negative overall and that will have a short term negative impact on the price of bitcoins. The hearings will start to negatively affect the price (that does not mean the price goes down as there are many factors that contribute to the price, here I am just discussing the effect that this one factor will have) just before the start of the hearings, let’s say from 9:00 that morning and continue for 48 hours (the life of a news story) after the findings or recommendations are released or if they are not going to release anything 48 hours after the hearing close.

Bit coin is a currency, an investment, a unit of account, a store of value, a payments system and a technology. That is why no one knows how to value it other than current market rate and that has contributed to the volatility.

Even if they were 2mb that would give us 14 transactions per second which is still laughably inadequate. We need no maximum but then some functions to not let it get out of hand such as a good solution to of chain transactions and grouping micro transactions.

OP is right. You only have a profit or loss if you buy at one price and sell at another price. Your buy price is already set whether you make a profit or not depends on the sell price. If you have not sold you have not made a profit or loss yet. the price change is known as paper profit or paper loss.

My understanding is anyone could make the change if the new protocol was accepted by 51% of nodes. I reality 51% of nodes are only going to accept an update made by the core developers and they would look at it very closely first. 
I for one hope the core developers get very active in making  improvements to the protocol to stay ahead of the game. Even with some marketing and PR considerations in mind such as steering everyone to talk about mbtc instead of btc. I doubt it though they are obviously tech heads.

How do I confirm the funds are in the offline wallet I generated from bitaddress.org?

There is a theory that they are trying to "protect" their citizens from over exposing themselves and potentially losing huge on btc. Generally they always waterdown anything that is overheating in their economy and don't let it become to big to fail.

We can worry about this "the government is / will try to stop bitcoin" malarkey when and if there is any evidence of it, for now there is not so onward and upward.    
I really doubt any of them own any btc, they don't need to be so proactive to generate wealth, companies would literally pay them to do nothing. 
I get the impression those that don't understand  it can not yet tell where their interest lies so they are reserving judgment and those that do understand it realise it has upside and they can't stop it anyway. Obviously $2 million from an established bank or payment processor would make any of them the most avid anti bitcoin advocate you could imagine. If that happens we just have to respond with reason.

People selling now are taking profits so have made some money. Do you think they will ever want some more money in the future? When they do what are they going to buy and what will that do to the price?
Not only that but they will tell people how they made money trading bitcoins, what is that going to do for awareness? 
Particularly if we can settle in 4 figures this correction is good news for bitcoin.

This demonstrates why mbtc is still too large a denomination to be our new standard, the debate has to be ubtc or satoshis and I wish we would decide quickly because we are losing potential converts every day with the cumbersome $1000 instrument.

I believe the hearings will be negative overall and that will have a short term negative impact on the price of bitcoins.
The hearings will start to negatively affect the price (that does not mean the price goes down as there are many factors that contribute to the price, here I am just discussing the effect that this one factor will have) just before the start of the hearings, let’s say from 9:00 that morning and continue for 48 hours (the life of a news story) after the findings or recommendations are released or if they are not going to release anything 48 hours after the hearing close...

I would assume those two companies now have a much larger stock of bitcoins than they really want BUT they would have been prepared for that and have some strategies to correct their position. They might not want to go the exchanges with that volume so they might look for deals with startups that want btc or the early adopter hedge funds and wall street guys that we have not heard about yet.

Anyone can code up and propose a new version of bitcoin and if the majority of nodes accept it it is implemented. Nothing happens to "old" coins.
In reality the only people with enough sway in the community to get a change implemented are the core developers at the bitcoin foundation, this is a bit of a sore spot...

Matt a documentary called "the rise and rise of bitcoin" is coming out soon. It looks like it will be really good and about bitcoin from the beginning up until just before US senate hearings.   
You should make a full length feature documentary about bitcoin gaining acceptance and entering the mainstream financial system starting from the senate hearings and the China boom. You have the wall street connections form blomberg and the bitcoin community on your side.
You could distribute it in the Lowe CK model but for bitcoins then you would be providing a good and getting paid in bitcoins.

technically the limit is not on tps it's on the block size which is 1 mb. we can fit about 4200 transaction in a 1mb block and they are made about every 10 minutes so on average you can have about 7tps before the blocks are too big to fit any more transactions in. 
No one considers it beneficial to have less tps but some consider it beneficial to have small blocks because it stops the size of the blockchain getting out of control  and keeps mining accessible to smaller miners.  
@_date: 2013-12-14 22:51:43
Thats exactly the case with me

There is a lot of agreement on that. What the community is debating is whether we should go to mbtc or satoshi as the standard. Given we can't agree if one of those is obviously better for Chinese users we should go with that.

Was it a business account or a personal account? What is the most debt it has been in, the debt, if any, at the time they sent the letter and the debt limit? 
As for why they are closing you its because you breached the terms and conditions. It would be hard not to, there are 96 pages of them :)
They should tell you which T&amp;C you broke but I am not sure if they have to. However if you lodge a FOI request they will have to tell you that and provide all the notes on your file. If it's a personal banking product your breach of the T&amp;C is obvious, using it for business purposes. 
Anyway lots of other good banks, I'd say you are right to look at NAB.

Basically the miners process all transactions and provide security but the best way to get bitcoins is not to mine them its to provide goods or services and accept bit coins as a source of payment.

I found the professor and sent him an email.  
"Hi professor, I was disturbed to read 
*"bitcoin's long-term viability would be determined by its rate of inflation. It's uncertain what their supply is going to be in the future, so it's uncertain what their value is going to be," he said. ~ UWA Winthrop Professor of Economics Ken Clements.*
That is 100% incorrect, in fact that describes the Australian dollar. In the case of bitcoin we know exactly what the supply is going to be as it is part of the protocol. There is a limited amount (21 million) that will ever exist and they are released at a known predictable rate. Bitcoin is deflationary but don’t worry 1 bitcoin can be divided to the 8th decimal place.  
You might find this collection of presentations by actual experts useful

They had hour long positive documentaries about bitcoin on state TV and now two of the biggest state owned enterprises are taking them. Top politicians have made public statements that are neutral on BTC
This does not happen on a whim, this only happens as part of long term plans. The beauty of not being able to be voted out every 4 years is that you can be patient and implement long term policies which is what the Chinese state does. 
Yes they could change their plan at some time in the future but if they do it will not be all of a sudden, they will take gradual steps so if you are particularly worried you will be able to see it coming and act accordingly but by that time bitcoin will have gone global enough that it wont matter like it would now.

This is a dumb sentiment. Did you say this when Gox had 45% and the vast majority of bitcoin trade was in the USA?
Its worth understanding the risk of Chinese government action but it just part of the game at the moment. There is also a chance they start to sell their UDS stockpile which would make bitcoin go up against the USD.
Chinese bitcoiners are diverse with diverse motivations. We all hope bitcoin will catch on more in all other countries.

Can a Bangladeshi working a construction site in Singapore instantly convert his pay into gold / bitcoin and send whatever amount of it he likes back to Bangladesh almost instantly and almost for free?

bitcoin yes, gold no.
Does gold / bitcoin let the unbanked become banked?
bitcoin yes, gold no
Does gold / bitcoin let people get around government impositions such as currency controls, investment restrictions and taxes?
bitcoin yes, gold in a few cases with great difficulty

Yes, bitcoin is the best way to do that though you are thinking about it slightly incorrectly. With bitcoin you will not transfer your net worth from Malaysia to the USA you will transfer you net worth from your malaysian bank account to your self. When you buy the bitcoins you will be our own bank and if you are in USA your wealth is where you are, if you are in Ecuador your wealth will be there with you. If you want to convert it back to USD when in the USA you will be able to do that there.

Thank god I don't use Mt gox so I might have this wrong but as far as I gather.
Customers can't withdraw bernakecoins so they are better of to buy btc with them then move the btcs to whatever wallet they like. This artificially creates people who want to buy at any price therefore artificially raises the price.
As the image shows they are ~ 12% higher than global average and ~ 15% higher than bitstamp.
This could be a problem for everyone because the media still quote Mt gox price as if they are the authority and will have stories of bitcoin going over $1200 and passing gold when it has not realy. 
Then word filters out bitcoins "biggest and best" exchange ( you would think it was if you just listened to the news reports and articles because its the one they always reference) is not paying out customers and displaying bogus prices = bitcoin is a scam and a ponzi scheme that is now collapsing cue large price drop. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:03:26


Did you miss the part about us reaching 88% of capacity or do you not realise the damage that an extra 12 % would have done to bitcoins media coverage, reputation with merchants and price? Today we were 12% away from being proven to be "not a real currency" and set back years. 
When are the core devs going to stop ummining and arghing and fix the transactions per second limitation? This is not something that can wait three years as you seem to suggest.

Hi Matt I am enjoying the segments. The reason your colleagues can't understand bitcoin price is because Bitcoin is so multifaceted its a currency, a payment processor, a technology, a store of value, a unit of account and an investment. Bitcoins allow any 2 people to transact almost free and instantly, anytime, anywhere online with no third parties such as banks or governments involved. Sending someone money is as quick and easy as sending an email
Compare that to the current financial system where remittances are charged 10-15%, credit cards 3%, international bank transfers take 5 business days, banks charge for using other banks ATMs, there are towns where you are not allowed to do business on Sunday and the government devalues your fiat currency 3% per year!
The current financial system is slow, unfair, unresponsive and out of date. Bitcoins are the game changer. Bitcoins are like gold for the internet, they do for money what peer 2 peer file sharing did for media. Remember when you had to go to a music shop and pay $15 for a 13 track CD? In 5 years the current financial system will seem like that.
The amazing technological innovation is to use a decentralized peer 2 peer network to record and verify all transactions on a public ledger based on proof. This has profound implications for all tech-based areas of our lives not just money. For example this is the best way to conduct electronic voting, to record and verify ownership titles for all types of property, to execute a will and to register domain names. This technology will replace sim cards in mobile devices, it goes on and on.

That is something that sold me on bitcoin. It is dynamic and flexible. Any great idea that the alt coins could come up with that could see them have an advantage over bitcoin, bitcoin can just copy it. We think bitcoins are the best invention since the internet so for something to be better than that it would be sooooo awesome and we would all want to move our money into it bitcoin or fiat. Bitcoiners will be in a better place to see that coming and make the change and the exchange than anyone.   
Namecoin is the one to look into not because its a good currency, its not, but its a good example of what other things peer to peer decentralized public ledgerts based on proof can be used for. Basically its a DNS register for web addresses that is open to anyone and the address can not be seized or shut down by anyone like the DOJ did to poker sites a few years back.

And for providing security to the network

Dwolla is a central body so they can
* Shut your account
* Sell your details 
* Be shut
* Hire incompetent management that make poor decisions
* Be bribed/corrupted/blackmailed by organised crime/ banks / politicians 
* Have their HQ blown up
* Have their security compromised
And so on. Also they use fiat currencies the problems with which are manifold.

Why do people think this will happen so quickly? I mean I know it will happen, I think it will happen in the next few months, people here seem to think it will happen within a week

Here is [a collection of jokes about betting with bitcoin](
A bum asks a man for ฿0.002. The man says, “Will you buy booze?” The bum says, “No.” The man says, “Will you gamble it away?” The bum says, “No.” So the man says, “Will you come home with me so my wife can see what happens to a man who doesn’t drink or gamble?”
A man walks into a butcher’s shop and asks the butcher: “Are you a gambling man?” The butcher says “Yes”, so the man said: “I bet you ฿10 that you can’t reach up and touch that Beef hanging on the hooks up there.” The butcher says “I’m not betting on that.” “But I thought you were a gambling man” the man retorts. “Yes I am” says the butcher “but the steaks are too high.”

Good point about taxes. Just as all people in a nation would have equal right regardless to what we now call citizenship all people in a nation would have the same tax obligations. This probably means you could not have the current 12 month tax bill as it would be easy to skip out of it although if you had a running tax obligation the state could check it as you leave and make it due every 12 months if you dont leave. Or they could tax all transactions and payroll etcetera as it occurs. There are lots of potential solutions.
Remember in the no citizenship model the state can impose whatever tax it likes just so long is it is imposed on all people in their territory regardless of what we now call citizenship. 
NB In the current system cops DO protect non-citizens/non tax payers

Thats cool, as a believer I enjoyed it. Could you make one with only neutral and positive clips we can show the uninitiated?  
I mean could you start with that video and just delete all the parts that are negative about bitcoins?

Exactly, SEOs call "buy bitcoin" "buy gold" a transactional search which is a least 5 times as valuable than an information search "bitcoin" "gold"
Why did they both go up in April?

TLDR but
Can a Bangladeshi working a construction site in Singapore instantly convert his pay into gold / bitcoin and send whatever amount of it he likes back to Bangladesh almost instantly and almost for free? Bitcoin yes, gold no
Has gold / bitcoin value been rising for the last 4 years? bitcoin yes, gold no.
Does gold / bitcoin let the unbanked become banked? bitcoin yes, gold no
Does gold / bitcoin let people get around government impositions such as currency controls, investment restrictions and taxes? bitcoin yes, gold in a few cases with great difficulty
Can I take my net worth in gold / bitcoins with me all around the world, no hassles? bitcoin yes, gold no.
Does gold / bitcoin have incredible potential we have not even thought of yet?
bitcoin yes, gold no.

Found it 


Single Pass - By default all wallets are stored by AES encrypting the entire JSON payload with the users password which is then encoded as base64. A 16 byte iv is prepended to the wallet file used for PBKDF2 key stretching. The exact AES specifications are n rounds of PBKDF2 (Default 10 if not specified), Block Mode CBC ISO10126 padding.
var crypted = Crypto.AES.encrypt(json, password);
	
Second Phase Encryption - Once the JSON payload is decrypted using first phase decryption if it contains the field "double_encryption" with a value of true any private keys are encrypted with a second password using the shared key as a salt. In Addition the wallet will also contain a 10 Round SHA256 hash of the sharedKey and second password (dpasswordhash) which can be used to quickly verify if the second password is valid.
Users should be prompted to enter their second password only when access to the private keys is needed e.g. When creating a transaction.

I believe they work on a ~1% tax rate and you only have to have a symbolic office there while all your staff are in London or anywhere making this the perfect jurisdiction for future bitcon service companies.

I don't think these small businesses and one person website we have been flooded with have accounts at the exchanges, so they would have converted via bitpay or coinbase who now have a shit tone of bitcoins more than normal on there hands.

you can put or call options on the price of bitcoins and win .80c on $1 at these binary option sites.

Another pretty boring article about bitcoin from India. Not worth us reading for the content of the article but it's further proof there is a real buzz in India at the moment. 
I added to the comments 
You say "There are two ways to own a Bitcoin" you failed to mention the best way to get bitcoins that is to provide a good or service (such as your job) and accept bitcoin as payment.
As that is a huge peeve of mine
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:31:21
Youll be fine mate, your obviously a true believer and a sharp guy. Be confident, you already no everything you need to know, please pull up the host when he says some bullshit like "until bitcoin gets replaced by the next fad" or "criminals love to use bitcoins" when the host says that shit even if it is not a question to you interrupt them and correct them.
