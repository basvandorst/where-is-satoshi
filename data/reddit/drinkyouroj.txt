Yes! Glad to see _someone_ gets it: increased liquidity for Bitcoin is *always* good.
I'm surprised at how negatively Twitter has been reacting to this news... 
"Bitcoin is supposed to mean no banks! Onward to Bittrex with our pitchforks and torches!" 
"But, guys, how does an average person buy any cryptocurrency unless they first trade the USD in which they're paid?"
"...Yeah, but, ... something something Binance!"
Tribalism and blind allegiances make me sick. Despite "living" in the same city, I've not been a "fan" of Bittrex (to put it mildly) for a long time. However, as a fan of all things blockchain and someone that wants to see Bitcoin become the global exchange currency, I don't see how more exchanges adding more BTC/USD trading pairs is anything other than fantastic news for all cryptocurrencies. The faster/easier it is for "average" people to buy and sell $BTC at-will (for crypto or fiat, or goods and services) the more people there are using the Bitcoin, meaning more direct commerce; _*eventually*_ - unless they change their business model from "stealing your money through bullshit fees" - banks will either die or be forced to offer new products/services aimed at providing value to people who don't need a middle man to conduct commerce or store their wealth.
Until workers are paid directly in cryptocurrency, there will always be a need for fiat/crypto trading pairs. Otherwise, unless you mine your own or someone gives you theirs, how do you acquire any crypto of any kind? (I guess you could use faucets ... good luck financing your Lambo with that. ;-P )

Yep, "a weird euphoric feeling" definitely accompanied my first bitcoin purchase. It may or may not have been an order from a dark web–based site…�� ��
My first "mainstream" bitcoin purchase (with $BTC directly—not a merchant service that takes your credit/debit card &amp; transacts in bitcoins on the back-end, as all the pot shops in Seattle have now…��) was GPU from NewEgg…to help me mine more Monero. ��
