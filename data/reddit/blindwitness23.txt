ahhhh the old Buy High - Sell Low trickery

I have 'day trading' thought all the time, even though I am a hodler. But I still check on prices all the f*cking time. Sometimes I literally get pissed at myself for doing it so much, or if I'm really into work, and then my coffee break is checking crypto prices...
It's addicting man...

Yes, the good old, Buy High - Sell Low tactic! I like it!

You are are a great human being! Stuff like this makes me believe in humanity. Also I bet you understand the things that Bill Gates does with the Gates foundation! To quote you 'Because once you have enough money, money doesn't matter.'

Hmmm, yeah I guess that's true. If they put an order to buy a ridiculous amount, at a very high price, then it would be traded. But it needs to be at the, or higher price than what someone has put the order to sell for.

Yep, but they did open a branch in Spain, and had a problem with a much smaller number of customers than they predicted, and when they hired an external consultant firm to analyze why this has happened, they can up with it being a culture - language thing, (You don’t want to keep your money in a Duck bank, yeah?) so they had to do a rebranding for the Spanish speaking countries market.

*Confession Bear* Sometimes before bed, I put all of my assets on sale for a ridiculous price, thinking someone might fuck up, and the order goes trough, even though I know the exchange would just complete their buy order at the market price.

Ask a Spanish person what does the name of this bank mean in Spanish slang!
It means quite literally Dick Bank!

I got pissed for waiting as well and saw it go from 1200 when I wanted to buy, to 2000 EUR in a few days. Got some via [LocalBitcoins]( Just kept them there until Kraken approved me...
