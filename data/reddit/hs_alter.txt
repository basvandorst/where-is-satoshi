When I sold some at 8k and it went to 11k i felt bad. Couldnt imagine someone who sold at like 14, 100 or 1000 feels like.

This meme made me smile.
I dont know why I keep an eye on the price. I'm not selling anytime soon and I am not buying anymore till August.

Just think if you bought a million instead of hundred you could have made... a hundred.

First time I heard of bitcoin it was $40 then I heard it was 600.
Never bought till a few months ago at $4,800. Better late then never.

Curious what you guys think of what I did. I cashed out my 401k cause I left that job it was only 5k. 
I used the 5k less fees and taxes and put it on ky school loan. Lowering the principle that was getting hit with interest was saving me 4k.
3k principle + 4k in interest savings = 7k for a 5k 401k. 
Sooner my loan is paid off. the more I can contribute to my new 401k.

Divided by 21million
Bitcoin = $95,238

Your right. My cousin was like wish we bought in the beginning. I said we would have been out at 500.

How is there a gap when it trades 24/7? I always thought gaps were if a stock closes at 100 then opens next day at 110.

Watch the economy fall apart and politicians only care to criticize bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:31:56
Ummk yea. Can i get that bitcoin back I sold at 10.4k for 10.4k?
Thatd be great.

Internet providers will give information to the government about bitcoin use. General public would be scared to use it. USA companies would never take it as payment if its illegal. 
Those are my concerns.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:23:03
Glad to get back in sooner rather then later
@_date: 2019-05-31 04:54:35
Back to the 8100s gross.
