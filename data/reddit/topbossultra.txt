But is there a way to easily use Gemini on my phone? For now, this is my primary reason for using Coinbase and GDAX, but I am looking to try alternatives.

RemindMe! January 17th, 2018 “u/greatvaluearguments said BTC would hit $21,485.73 today at 4:43.”

I agree with that, but I guess what I'm saying is the perceived worth of fiat hasn't taken a hit, meaning that the value of bitcoin has increased. If the value of fiat ever does take the kind of hit you're describing, bitcoin will be worth way more than what it is now.

In your expert opinion, what will BTC's value be on January 17th 4:43 PM EDT?

I don’t think facts support this. Is there a reason to believe fiat’s value has went down over 1400% this year? Milk doesn’t cost 1400% more, but bitcoin does. Bitcoin’s value is increasing. This isn’t a bad thing though.

While this may be true about banks, it still means fiat’s value has not dropped yet, which says that the value of bitcoin has increased. I don’t use value to mean what USD should be worth according to supply and demand or r/bitcoin. When I say value I mean perceived worth. The perceived worth of the dollar has not changed 1400% in the past year for the average person, but the perceived worth of bitcoin has.

I’d love to buy in, but do you think I’m getting in too late? Did I already miss the boat?
I’ll see myself out.

I feel like the instant this happens people will be talking about how Bitcoin crashed from 17k to 17 dollars.

Depends on the debt. I'd say if you have student loans and a mortgage but nothing else, it's not bad to put some of your money in crypto. Certainly not 10k, but something small every month is worth the potential pay off.

I’m not asking if it’s too late to get in Bitcoin. I’m already in a few cryptos. I’m asking if it’s too late to get in on this Titanic thing he’s talking about. 
Keep up with the conversation!

Not with that attitude.

I bought for the first time today! I get to be wise and foolish at the same time. Welcome to the future.

You would never say "virtually the vast majority" because that's what "virtually all" means.

This did not age well.
