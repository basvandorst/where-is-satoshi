Tl;dr?

Why is never kraken.com included in any of overview like this? And why is it not inkludet at blockchain to even out the average? 
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:24:48
should add .txt to that list
@_date: 2014-01-27 00:24:19
Ty. Think they will ever manage? And what is the "limit"?

Really helpful, thanks alot Vycid. I can't understand why Kraken dont like pie. 
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:11:45
Get out. Eject! Now! 
@_date: 2014-01-27 15:12:54
Yes, i totaly agree. Depending on one (in this case bad) source is not good. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 15:28:33
Like waffels

Yes, Coindesk or Bitpay would be better than Gox

It is not about artificially lower the price. I can't understand where you would get that idea? 
The price per bitcoin is determined by offer-demand, and to base the price of the coin on one exhance which is ruined by their own lack of verifying prosess, is bad choice. 
Have you give this thread a read? or the blog i linked? 
It makes no sense for a big currency tracker to have bad information when it comes to price. And spesially in bitcoins.

I tried 8 times to press ok, but it did not work. It was just a picture

As a fairly new Bitcoiner, whats pump and dump? 
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:07:58
