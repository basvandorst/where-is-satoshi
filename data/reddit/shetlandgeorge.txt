We will always be in debt and it will continue to grow but switching to Bitcoin takes a lot of control away from the government, therefore they have to think before they spend and that hopefully means they will think sensibly. Fingers crossed, that will reduce the amount of money that is wasted by them and that will mean life is a little easier for the common man.

I was prompted to change username, password and PIN with Scrypt.cc which I did. Now I cannot get in as it won't accept my new username, password, etc or my old ones and the reset password page is just an empty sheet. It's a ripoff, Scrypt has stolen my btc and blocked me out. Take my advice - DON'T INVEST ANY MONEY THERE because Marcelo Santos, AKA Admin will rip you off.

I may be wrong but ScryptOcean.com appears to be owned by the same guy that ripped us off with scrypt.cc. Beware!!!

Everybody thinks they should be the CEO of everything - as long as reality stays out of it!!!

I'm now blocked out of both sites, no doubt intentionally, so cannot access my money. That tells me one thing - Stay away from Marcelo Santos as he has done nothing more than to prove himself to be a thief and a conman.

He called me yesterday and asked for your number. I didn't know it so I suggested he call the operator.
