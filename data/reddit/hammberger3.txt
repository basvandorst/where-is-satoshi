I agree, Apple sucks. People have told me Androids are too confusing for them (but I'd recommend one to anyone with an IQ above 80)

Maybe one vote is insignificant. But if you do nothing to change the media or the economy, it will only get worse. So maybe you need to do something bigger, rather than nohing.

Blockchain? *block. Idiots.

With Bitcoin, there's at least a chance of a price increase. But with a safe, well, inflation never stops.

You're an anarchist, then?
@_date: 2015-07-04 03:50:36
And how much did you donate, you saint?
@_date: 2015-07-02 00:50:42
So, what your saying is this: We're probably misinformed so we shouldn't say anything at all. Correct?
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:12:09
I'm super confused; I don't think I understood what you said. Sorry

You should establish the price with him beforehand

That was an example, and, btw, PewDiePie says words that should never reach the ears of 8 year olds.
@_date: 2015-04-22 19:53:29
I have often thought about this, but you would probably need to persuade someone famous, like PewDiePie, where the info would get out to millions of people quickly
