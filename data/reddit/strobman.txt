Thanks for your replies.  I'll have to look up on how best to do this and what the change (assuming the 'dust') entails.

I'm asking.  Read that somewhere but can't remember, looking for it now.  Would love more insight.

If this is the case he could transfer all his funds to a new wallet to lower the transaction fee, right?  Would that transfer cost the same?
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:44:38
can you explain to this noob how all that works?
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:09:39
lightning can't move forward for several months, correct?
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:23:10
I'm planning on buying $300 a month, eventually I'll own 1BTC, lol.  Can't imagine having $36k/yr in disposable income, but congrats and I hope you do well.

AFAIK nothing will change.  Lightning (whenever it occurs, I asked the question earlier in the thread) will be the next possible fork.  Please correct if I'm wrong as I'm rather new and don't understand completely.

Coinbase is the safest of exchanges, but a wallet (hardware, paper, desktop, mobile in order) seems to be safest.

wasn't lightning only possible with Segwit?  I thought that BTC couldn't move to lightning without a block change which Seqwit is the solution to.

Doesn't all the questions about evading the IRS here make it more likely that they try their damndest to crack down?
I feel like these questions shouldn't be allowed, if you want to evade the government find instructions on tor.  Otherwise you look like a fool or an agent looking for clues.

So basically every time I add funds to my wallet I'm creating a larger transaction size?  If I were to move all my funds from one wallet to another will it keep adding to that transaction size or will it decrease the size from the original (say 10 transactions)?

also need to provide a photo as proof via GDAX if I'm correct
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:47:29
Thanks for the answer

are you speaking of Etherum?
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:17:23
governments clamping down on it seems very possible to me

your private key is the 12 words they supplied and told you to write down and then made you enter before you could use your wallet
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:35:16
This is my confusion as well.  People are saying to open a BCC wallet using your BTC private key, but I'm worried that doing so will empty the BCC wallet.  I'm using Electrum as well, once it forks will both show up in Electrum and I can just send the BTC to a separate wallet instead of having to use my private key?
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:18:06
you and me both, I'd be happy with just 1 tbh
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:28:45
If you use your BTC wallets key (the 12 words) to open a BCC wallet won't it move all your funds to the new wallet therefore emptying the BTC wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:27:31
yeah, I'm going to wait at least a few days after the fork to look up guides showing how to split the two.  if I miss a little or all the profit so be it, I'm too worried about losing everything due to a mistake
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:18:03
lets just make it 30m and call it a day
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:49:01
why did you keep your money on an exchange?
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:22:14
I'm hoping for 1900USD personally
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:29:36
I believe it's one and the same.  Just remember those words and your username/pw and you should be able to move it to a new wallet if needed.  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:36:47
Coinbase is just an exchange, once you buy it from there transfer your funds into a wallet.
