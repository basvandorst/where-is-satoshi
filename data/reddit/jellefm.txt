But lower difficulty also brings a reduction in security by making a 51% attack "easier". The goal should be to maintain a high difficulty. One could argue that the difficulty is unnecessarly high though.

I have a question about the payment to miners. Currently a mined block is rewarded 12.5 BTC, which has a massive value. Once the miner reward is gone in many years, what will the incentivise the same amount of mining power as we have now?
I always assumed that we would have enough transactions at that point with small fees to pay the miners, but since we are already at maximum capacity, where does the payments come from? 
The problem actually increases if you add second layer solutions to the equation, that would take a lot of transactions from the bitcoin network, reducing the payment for miners.
Arent the only 2 solutions for this problem: Bigger block sizes (No, I am not promoting BCH or Segwit2x) or maintaining a mining reward indefinetly?
I was debating making a thread about it, but lets see if this thread works ;)

"A coinbase transaction is a unique type of bitcoin transaction that can only be created by a miner. This type of transaction has no inputs, and there is one created with each new block that is mined on the network. In other words, this is the transaction that rewards a miner with the block reward for their work."

I can confirm, I was one of the hacked and I had upvoted this post.

Holy crap, it happend to me to! I upvoted literally all reddit posts that contain positive news about bitcoin cash. And downvoted all threads about the bots. I have reset my password, so I am fine now. But this makes bitcoin cash even more shady.

Ah, thanks! That is indeed basically what I am trying to create with this idea. So I had a quick google search and people tend to discuss pruned nodes as inferior to full nodes. Do you have any idea why pruned nodes would not be able to function the same way as full nodes do? What makes them less useful?

It honestly sounds like you are tackeling a whole different problem. I am not saying diskspace is expensive, but as an average user with a glass fiber connection, I'd rather have a 3 GB node that takes a bit more network traffic then a 150 GB node. But it would be cool if you had the choice, wouldn't it? :)

Nice, I am practicing writing smart contracts for a job interview tomorrow. This is a good exercise idea that is somewhat unique to show :)

Looking at the big green spikes in the last few days and especially the last few hours. I keep wandering if these are just your average whales using the market or that some big players are entering bitcoin before it gets to expensive.

An almost empty mempool only shows that the network is perfectly capable of processing the current rate of transactions. It doesn't mean that there is no volume ;) A backlog starts to exist of the network is basically used to heavily and bitcoin is unable to handle the amount of transactions which shows a fundamental problem with the network. So you should be happy that we are in a state where the network can handle it! Obviously there is still a need for more improvements and second layer solutions to make it future proof, but I am happy we have a working product right now.

Correlation != causation. I am not sure what this is trying to achieve. The day of the year may determine what is happening to the value? I can understand pay-days, but overall the days seem to have a normal distribution.

In the case that you don't find the wallet, don't give up yet. Their are more ways to retrieve your bitcoin! IIRC bitcoin keys should have a distinct signature that marks the private keys. So you could scan for those as well. Good luck!

I have bought back in completely now. I think the news of China has been priced in and it turns out we can totally live with the new state of affairs. And once there is nothing really holding us back, most people will go full FOMO on the fact that we are 1000 USD below ATH, so it's relatively cheap!

In terms of customer service and verification I really do like kraken. I did hear some people with verification issues, but others like me get through it really quickly. Their trading platform however, is quite abysmall. About 60% of my orders don't go through resulting in me missing some peaks and dips. If you are not planning on day trading, you would not encounter many issues though.

The comparison has been made a lot, but it is like the early internet. Such channels like these are handeld by your router so everyone uses such a system without knowing about it. Bitcoin will go through the same process. Lightning Wallets will start to do all the channel stuff under the hood, and all you see are instant transactions with low fees. Users will not have to concern themselves with the underlying technique's.

I think this is one of the most important next steps. We need to make crypto more accessible to the general public. And they don't want to be educated to use the system. We have to create a User Experience where you can buy, send and receive crypto without having to know any terms like keys, address and blocks. It should feel like you are using any other easy payment systems.
