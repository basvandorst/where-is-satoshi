I took sold my bitcoins today.  I made some money but started to feel like I was at a casino and I never cash out when I know I should have.  Well I am kinda regretting it now because I know I will never be able to buy back the bitcoins at what I bought them for.

Yeah I am hoping cash does not do well.  it makes me mad it got invented in hopes of taking Bitcoin down.

Oh wow small world. I actually live in Portland but I went to Prescott for the day to see some friends but it wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be. I guess I thought I had more friends. 
Back to bitcoin.. because it has gone done so much in the last few days I'm debating on selling my bitcoin and put it in something else. Like litecoin? Any opinions?

So now the question is... is the fear going to take over? Is the bitcoin phenomenon over?

I'm going back and forth on selling bitcoin and buying something else like litecoin. I've been reading about this new BItcoin cash and I just don't know if I want to support that. Opinions?

I use coinbase that has all my decimals of bitcoins in it... then I have the blockchain app with a zero balance in it.  Do I somehow connect these two apps?  Do I send my coinbase balance to my blockchain?  Why would I need 2 apps for the same amount of bitcoin? Help?

What is your opinion on why bitcoin has went down in the past few days?
