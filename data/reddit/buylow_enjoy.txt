A currency becoming more and more... worthless... is good for us :) Really?
The systems built around the currency might depend on its characteristics but that does not make inflation a good characteristic.

Ben also said gold is not a currency... Seen it on Youtube!
Also banks cant run out of money as long a central bank backs them up on their ability to lend more money to cover previous debt+interest+losses. 
Ben said 'they' never lost a penny doing 'it'. If you look at debt accumulation rising like the bitcoin price you know thats not true either.

When you use a CC you pay someone... That person just got ripped off, got his product or service stolen and has no protection.

I think that the goal of the article was simply to get attention, and it worked. Huge moral expense, short term gain. Company was already far down the hill so short term gain is all that matters to them apparently. If they now claim this was not foreseen.. well.. that is just sad..
It is sad, but reality. News and reporting should not be confused with the truth and facts, at best a fractional truth, or the presentation of biased facts. 
Treat it as such and combine information to come to your own conclusions. 
The feeding of this troll follows from human nature, some events inevitably trigger a response.

The price per coin does not matter, and transaction costs for such amounts are already neglecible.

price - cost = capital gains = taxable.. 
don't make it complicated

Or you could read the bible yourself and come to a conclusion on your own, no need for a priest. Same with the protocol.

What if I want to store my value in something volatile :)
Easy counter argument?
