@_date: 2017-12-11 11:11:44
You buy more Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:46:09
Move those coins into a secure wallet don't leave them on an open exchange like coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:14:12
Yeah no kidding, I've been hearing people talking about it lately at work and all over the radio!

Yes sell me some cheap coins please
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:22:28
Paper right away, hardware wallet at 1k+. Don't leave it on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:49:31
It's happening to everyone, just wait a few hours and it'll go through.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:47:40
I lol'd at that pic
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:12:35
Everyone in a couple years if they hodl
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:09:26
Lol sure you do and if you had that much I'd imagine you'd know the fees inside out by now.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:46:44
Yeah I've put about 10% of my monthly income in crypto over the past few months.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:42:50
You can use a credit/debit and other different form of payments. It's easier than you think really. All you do is go to an exchange and set up an account then purchase the amount you are satisfied with. I suggest using coinbase.com as its very user friendly.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:42:04
10 Bitcoins for $3!! I hope he HEDL them.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:06:18
But why would you when it would come out more expensive in the long run?
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:00:57
Sick ride dude
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:57:15
Fair point good sir.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:01:34
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:29:28
Do you mean Bitcoin exchanges? The best wallet is the Ledger Nano S.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:56:15
You could make a poster beside your ATM saying "Don't buy your Bitcoin here we have massive transaction fees. Please buy your Bitcoin only from trusted online exchanges. Thank you and have a good day."
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:58:44
Probably lost at this point
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:46:46
1. Go to an exchange ( Most people tend to use Coinbase but there are several others )
2. Sign up and get verified on the online exchange
3. Create a wallet either paper or hardware ( hardware is better and safer )
4. Transfer funds off the exchange to your personal wallet
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:15:12
Took me approx. 15 mins on a not so popular exchange a few hours ago.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:29:36
and HODL
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:34:49
Fake and gay
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:53:48
I personally went with the Ledger Nano S, I can tell you I have no complaints but both are very solid choices.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:51:59
It won't ever hit zero if you hodl
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:33:24
Santa can't spell HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:13:24
Who remembers the 10k by Christmas articles a few weeks ago?
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:56:23
My Ex was a BCH
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:59:32
Hodl for life, to the moon my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:39:18
Garbo coin
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:29:41
There is a selling cap to prevent this from happening.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:43:11
Seems kind of pointless unless you need that money that moment you might as well HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:22:40
Bcash is trash, you made the right decision.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:21:47
Those look like some tasty noob tears who panic sold
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:55:31
Send them to reddit
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:59:29
You spelt HODL wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:19:39
Ho Ho Hodl Merry Bitmas
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:49:51
There are plenty of companies accepting cryptocurrencies online and more by each passing day. If everyone was to give up on cryptos then yes it would essentially be worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:05:36
What's so bad about alts?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:37:46
2018? try 2020! Buckle up it's going to be a wild ride!
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:56:39
Don't use ATM's use online exchanges. ATM's have massive transaction fees and can take forever to get your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:41:51
Use it to buy more Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:50:21
Sell low buy high am I doing it right?
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:34:41
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:16:32
Where did these coins come from?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:54:54
Not quite he has $120 worth lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:48:41
I don't see it dipping back down to 10k maybe 13k at most. I'd put my money on the 20k.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:58:09
5% of $9500 = $475 and 5% of $16,893.80 is $844.69 so you made $369.69 before fees and taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:34:58
Couldn't you say the same about early bitcoin investors?
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:34:48
You can start by not begging others and earning profit on your own.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:36:14

I r8 8/8 M8 was Gr8
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:18:10
Yes it supports 25-30 different altcoins
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:37:09
Over 90% of cryptos for that matter but I'm glad you have a soft spot for BTC. ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:01:57
Cool story bro
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:30:12
"Today I want to talk about the bounce back of the cryptocurrency market" Uh oh were back in the red lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:22:37
Try a different exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:00:46
As a main stream digital currency used in transactions worldwide. Eliminate 3rd parties and lower transaction costs.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:58:05
2k is still a solid investment even if you don't have a full bitcoin. You could be part of the "100 million club"
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:24:06
Typical noob question, have some patience my friend. It's been like 3 days max lol.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:06:11
Check out some youtube videos regarding altcoins
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:01:57
It's possible if there's no demand for Bitcoin anymore or if an altcoin surpassed Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:51:14
Coinbase doesn't support Canada atm you could use QuadrigaCX to sell off BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:01:56
Do 50% BTC 50% Altcoins
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:21:46

The power of HODLing ladies and gentlemen.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:55:19
No one ever taught you that the market moves both ways? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:03:58
I can explain it in one word for you: Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:42:46
Real men check Bitcoin prices on toilets
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:41:32
What are we disagreeing on?
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:44:49
Yeah those all time highs mean bitcoin is dead
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:47:28
I'll buy all your coins for cheap 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:27:07
Sell Low Buy High

QuadrigaCX cheers from Ontario. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:27:30
He gave someone access to his account information over the phone what a moron lol.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:21:12
Good for those darknet purchases and massive transactions. Day to day living we aren't there yet.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:00:56
50% in BTC and 50% in other cryptos
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:08:29
5% master race checking in.

Before you RIP can you scan my QR code bro
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:01:48
Someone might ask me for a small loan of one million dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:42:34
If you put in $100 and forget about it until next year it could be worth $1000
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:43:02
Yes but they are hiding
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:38:34
It's never too late, if you don't get in now, you will be asking the same question a couple months from now.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:28:52
Buddy is laughing straight to the bank
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:40:15
Must be that new altcoin titcoin damn that titcoin
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:58:52
So what you're saying is there's a chance?
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:22:15
One reason would be there's no one to manage our money. We are responsible and accountable for our own actions if we get hacked and lose everything.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:05:49
Intro scene: Hey baby, ever been with a member of the 21 million club? *Pants drop*
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:38:07
Anyone else reading that wrapping paper like hodl hodl hodl?
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:41:47
HODL for another year and you'll have enough for 100 laptops.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:59:44
Faker than titcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:11:33
Hodl for life and exchange bitcoin for online goods. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:06:28
Me but I'm working overnight aha
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:11:21
There are other exchanges besides coinbase you could sell through.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:28:10
Ride the wave baby!
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:35:25
Buy now. Actually wait 2 more minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:30:22
Cool story bro
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:30:44
Leave it at home in a safe place, less risk of losing it while traveling.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:17:32
Yes $100 is enough to invest, look into some of the online exchanges such as coinbase and gdax to purchase your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:03:15
Definitely worth getting one once you have $1000+ worth of crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:04:04
People ask this question everyday yet it continues to raise.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:57:23
I swear I didn't know the answers to any of these questions the first time I invested into bitcoin lol.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:11:16
An altcoin could always surpass Bitcoin in the future. Some people may be taking a chance on some of these coins or just trying to make a quick buck. Some of these altcoins could make faster profit compared to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:33:45
Sell Low Buy High
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:52:48
buy HODL don't sell GL
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:14:08
My advice: Buy, don't sell and HODL
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:50:53
I'd say yes, go for a Ledger Nano S or a Trezor.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:59:49
I'll use them for an exchange of goods but never sell them for cash.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:33:23
Check out the Ledger Nano S, best hardware wallet in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:35:25
Damn that's unreal and my Litecoin was instant. I guess no one buys altcoins not nearly as much in comparsion to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-24 02:17:54
Looks like someone stuck a sticker on there lmao
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:06:13
It seems a hell of a lot easier to get paid in fiat. Use that on everyday items then buy bitcoin with the remainder.
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:45:04
So you didn't file them.
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:59:17
Best time to invest is now
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:26:12
Where can I buy this?
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:22:57
Hodl until you win
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:25:05
Buy and Hodl until 2020 you won't regret it!
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:22:57
Hodl until you win
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:26:48
Hodl until 2020 no regrets
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:44:08
Buy high sell low

Where can I buy this?
@_date: 2018-07-04 20:28:08
I'm the guy hodling on the motorcycle.
