I have an issue with comparing the market cap of Western Union to the market cap of Bitcoin. It seems like apples and oranges. I understand that he's trying to place a valuation on the payment system represented by the technology of the bitchain. 
However, actual Bitcoins are not a stock in that technology, they are the units that are transferred using that technology. That would be like saying the "market cap" of Western Union is the value of all dollars in existence, since that is the means of exchange using the Western Union network.

Not sure what warranted an ad hoc attack. I am merely pointing out a flaw in the analysis. I have been wrestling with how to value Bitcoin, as I think many in the markets have. I don't even own any Bitcoin.

Western Union's market cap is based on some multiple of the revenues it generates from the fees it charges for consumers to make transactions using its network. Western Union moved $79 billion last year. 
There is no relevant Bitcoin analogue, to my knowledge, because there is no centralized network that collects transaction fees.

Correct. There is some inherent value in Bitcoins that reflects the desirability of transferring funds using the technology, however, the market cap of Western Union is not the best proxy. 
That would be the same as using the market cap of Western Union as a basis for some of the inherent value of the US dollar.
