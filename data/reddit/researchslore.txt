Your the one who should open your eyes.
Drugs are going to be bought and sold regardless of the DNM's, at least with the DNM's the purity and legitimacy of substances far surpassed buying them on the street. Also, "gangs" were getting drugs in bulk way before SR ever existed.
The prison-industrial complex and drug prohibition causes much more damage to individuals and communities than harm-reduction and education (which is the only reasonable strategy because you will never eradicate drugs). Not to mention the countless wasted billions on drug enforcement, imprisonment, and lost revenue on taxes.
Wake up and realize that you are not free when your government dictates what you can and can't put in your body. The current system is all about self-preservation, control and profit, and not about the false sense of care for communities that they like to parade around.

I'm using Tails OS, which comes with Electrum already installed. It may be a bit different for another OS. But yeah, your seed will generate the entire history of transactions for your wallet. I know that in the past when I've restored wallets, it can take some time for the wallet to synchronize with the blockchain.

Banks knowingly launder money all the time, the difference is that they just pay fines whereas normal people go to jail. For example: 
I'm sure you at least remember the 2007-2008 financial crisis? People should've gone to jail, instead they got bailouts and bonuses.
Banks fear bitcoin because it makes them obsolete, it's a store of value, and if you're storing your value in bitcoin the banks aren't profiting off of you.

I highly recommend Electrum, I've been using it for over a year now. You can set your own fees and you retain the private keys, it's also a very straightforward interface.

Basically with Electrum, you have a seed which is just a string of random words that will generate your wallet - no matter what computer you're using. As long as you have your seed, you have your wallet.
I used to store my coins on Blockchain.info but that's one of those wallets where you don't actually control your coins. Since I started using Electrum I haven't looked back.
