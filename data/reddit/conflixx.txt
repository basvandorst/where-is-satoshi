Considering how big Bitcoin's become, Reddit ain't the right platform for sufficient technical discussion. Developers and the like are better off discussing it somewhere else with like minded and evenly skilled people.
After all, Reddit markets itself as frontpage of the internet, not tech savy community page.
I am here to see the latest updates and trends within a big bitcoin community so I can take proper/more informed decisions about my investment while other people try to fix the technology. I might be part of the problem here. At least I believe in the technology, but yeah Reddit's my go to place for the latest updates on  cryptocurrency.
Reddit's a good place to get a lot of different opinions and the like about one subject. 
So if you release a new technology, then Reddit's the place to go for feedback. You shouldn't come here to discuss how to make a new technology etc. At least that's my opinion and I could be totally fucking wrong, won't be the first nor the last time.

Where I live his statement is true...
There where the most lanes are, are the most traffic jams. It's not without a reason there's more lanes than usual.
But in Bitcoins, if you increase the amount of lanes now, eventually it will just increase the amount of cars at any given time compared to now which won't fix the problem.

I think if it becomes available for payment all over the world.. worldwide adoption so to speak, would very much fluctuate the value. After this I think world wide adoption would increase the value because of the limited amount of bitcoins available. After world wide adoption, years later the value keeps increasing because more and more satoshis get lost. It will never be stable, but I do think it will go up in value compared to currencies.
That's just what a random noob adopter in the internet thinks though.

It's still bitcoin... You can see all the transactions their wallets are making so it creates more trust between you and the bank. As well as it still uses the blockchain technology for transactions. No need for the bank to process your transaction anymore. They just hold your bitcoin.
Though I trust in the banking system to find a really good way to rip people off again even with Bitcoin, its trustless and open transactions.
Still can't really wrap my head around how the idea is implemented, but it COULD be good news for Bitcoin.. could very well be bad news too.

I think that's kinda the thing with bitcoin.. interest rates inflate currencies. You can't have interest rates in bitcoin because bitcoin has a limited supply. Or they'd have to change how interest rates work. Well that's what I think, at least. If they're offering interest rates I'll definitely put bitcoin on their wallet.

These are just stupid answers from someone who's claiming to have wrapped his head around the concept of Bitcoin. Telling everybody to try and understand it themself but not helping them understand it when their opinion or vision differs from yours. The way I see Bitcoin now, I don't see it used as a currency either. With all of it's scaling problems and high transaction costs at the beginning of 2018. But I guess I'll just get another stupid answer since I can't wrap my head around the concept.

Well yeah exactly, I was purposely a little careful with what I was saying. But hot damn...

Buy videos for your youtube channel for not even 1 dollar per video while you monetize those videos? God damn clever but also a little bit douchy...

It's called inflation and that's not a good sign...
