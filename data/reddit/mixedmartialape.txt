The only interest people have in bitcoin is in speculating on its price. Everyone feigns a commitment to the 'tech' but the reality is that it is a swarm of fomo &amp; fantasy, with enough technical obfuscation that you can fill in the blanks and fool yourself.
What art doesn't have is a bunch of art dealers that print fake art tokens to buy and resell art, artificially inflating the prices and dumping their art on other people using those shady tactics. Aka tether.

Yes, ignore the long paragraphs of explanations I have provided. That is wise.
Best of luck.

Keep telling yourself that, see where it all goes. It'll go up and down, down and up, on the rollercoaster of pump and dump using tether to wash trade &amp; inflate the price and take money from idiots who FOMO in, just like the sucker who made this post.

Go research it. Because Bitfinex can print tether as much as it wants, they have already been forced to admit in court that USDT is not backed entirely by real USD. It can just print a bunch of tether and use it to wash trade &amp; inflate the price of bitcoin, causing FOMO as people buy in to catch the wave, once they hit a peak where new money slows down they dump their bitcoin on the market, leaving suckers with the bags, and the rest cash out into tether, whilst the exchanges get actual dollars.
Why else do you think it all just dumps at once? "Whales taking profits" Yeah, in a coordinated fashion after pumping the price up and picking the right time to pull the plug. It's a never ending rollercoaster of fucking over new money and people foolish enough to 'Hodl'.
Go research tether and it's use to inflate BTC prices. It's a very dirty thing.

Crazy coincidence, right? haha.

It's a real shame, because people are getting into crypto totally unaware of how risky it is, and what a manipulated space it is. Mostly folks who are smart enough not to get into some magic magnet MLM pyramid scheme, but not wise enough to enter this space with caution and research all the critical angles. I put money into some alts before 2017, went up a lot, didn't sell, came down a lot. Not a lot of $, and it was great fun until you realize it's all bullshit, so I am not elevating myself above others in my critique.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:28:48
This is a pyramid scheme. You are the most recent entrant. If you *hodl* on long enough you can sell to someone else, just like they sold to you. That is all that will come from this, don't get consumed with the echo-chamber that is this subreddit.

Because it was used by black markets, money laundering etc. so it was able to grow to it's smaller size based on actual usage. Then it went parabolic once tether was being used to inflate it, and that price movement is the basis for all the lofty, delusional dreams of it "hitting 50k by blah blah." I refuse to answer? Lol, you can be as defensive as you want, hopefully you make money, but you are arguing against facts because you feel that an idea you have built a lot on is being attacked. That's a normal human reaction.
What do you mean why it doesn't affect the alts? It does, it's just that there is far less demand for alts now after the 2017 pump, and so you can't get people to FOMO in like you can with bitcoin, along side the liquidity. If you go and look what happened during the 2017 pump, Alts pumped too. Everyone can get fooled by the lofty dreams of bitcoin, most people aren't willing to risk significant capital on the Alts even if there is some price movement, but it still happens and the charts show that.
I'm not going to back and forth with you any more. If you want to educate yourself on the role tether plays in inflating bubbles so that exchanges can profit and leave people holding bags, do so. If you want to pretend that bitcoin is going to make you rich, continue to do that as well. You can still make money in the space if you are aware of the truth, you just can't do it by 'hodling'. Good luck buddeh.

So delusional.
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:55:44
It's pretty easy to get roped in early, because most people haven't been exposed to pyramid schemes and the scale of bitcoin, plus the technical talk that is obscure enough that you can create a story about how it will change the world, instead of the cliche vitamin water or something that is easily disprovable and reeks from the jump. I bought in, didn't get burned bad but jumped on the hype train because it was great fun, fortunately i'm done with it now and I am just astounded looking back + reading some of these threads the level of delusion there is.
If you read about what tether is doing to pump the price, it's a scam that is in everyone's face and it's the exchanges and a few big whales who are profiting. This is going to go bad unfortunately.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:22:48
Just keep HODLing. Fortunately I don't have to be spiteful because your idiocy and complete lack of responsiveness to facts will lose you money 'investing' in bitcoin. Best of luck Buddeh'.

Cool, so you are here after the 2017/18 pump. If you were around then you would know that this answer is wrong.
@_date: 2019-06-28 05:44:32
It will probably take him losing money to understand.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:49:57
Educate yourself on the roll of tether in artificially inflating the price. Bitfinex controls tether, bitfinex prints more tether and uses it to buy bitcoin, wash trading to increase the price, people FOMO in, they sell their bitcoin for actual USD, not fake tether.
