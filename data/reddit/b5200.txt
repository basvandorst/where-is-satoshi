Yes, totally not a speculative commodity that is being traded as an investment and it's actually a super useful currency with built in transaction fees that everyone is clamoring to switch to for it's convenience.

So what was it like finding a time machine in Victorian England?

The community hasn't yet reached the tipping point where a majority of quality posters are so dissatisfied with the quality that they want to leave.  Right now creating a spillover subreddit for low quality posts would probably be much more effective.  It's like and vs and @_date: 2013-11-19 02:18:15
So slightly offtopic, but is it just something with bitcoin.clarkmoody.com or has somebody set up a pricefloor with thousands of bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:13:11
Yeah, you're going to be fairly disappointed when the bubble pops.  If you compare the cost of mining right now to the cost of bitcoins this is clearly unsustainable. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:37:44
Well yes, but it looks like a linear increase in the size of the bids as the price gets lower and it appears to be trailing the price.  I just don't know if this is because of the site or if somebody with lots of money is trying to prevent a panic crash presumably to drive the bubble higher.
Huh, I think the 'floor' dropped slightly with the price just now.  Shit's weird.

Screw the metals, you're better off with things that hold value for reasons that aren't because they're traditionally seen as valuable.

3 days till my cash hits dwolla, this will be fun waiting and seeing how much gains I'm missing out on.  If only I succeeded in trying to buy bitcoins way back at $20, but I was going to be spending them instantly and would probably feel even worse about it.
Edit: HAHAHAHAHHA

I'm saying he should hold things that actually have underlying value.  Unlike gold which is at it's current price solely because it's seen as valuable.  It's like a fiat currency that isn't useful as currency.  By the way your little condescending thing with the ellipses would be easier to follow if it actually adhered to English grammar.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:52:23
Yes, you should backpedal. All the way back to whatever reading comprehension class you missed.

I downvoted because I stopped taking you seriously and subsequently reading as soon as you called it downboating.

Oh right I forgot that coins are created at a stable rate, still gonna pop like a soap bubble on a windy day.
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:21:51
At least people use USD as currency, can't say the same for gold.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:50:22
I think you need to reread my first comment.  I didn't say buy things that aren't seen as valuable. I said buy things that are valuable for reasons other than just traditionally being seen as valuable.

Why would disaster make people start using gold as currency?  
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:45:39
Dividend paying stocks that generate fairly steady income? Commodities that are used to productive ends?  I mean gold does have some practical value, but not anything near what it's priced at because for whatever reason it's seen as a currency alternative.
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:12:55
Yes but why would people stop using USD.  The exact same arguments in favor of gold apply to fiat currency.
