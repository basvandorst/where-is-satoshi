Thank you for the suggestion. Never heard of Taurus Exchange before.

I agree with you GibbsSamplePlatter. When it does become mainstream the stock is going to jump through the roof!

I do this too. Would help if I could make a profit first. Silly bitcoin dropping in price to make this so hard to do right now.

I feel for you.
I'm a Canadian still waiting to verify with CAVirtex and this concerns me.
Bin waiting almost a month to verify so far.
Who do you recommend Canadians use otherwise that trades in CAD?

I've done this twice and their Facebook page.  Still no reply.

I'd say bitcoin is a market that is ready to go to the masses. 
From my 'limited' perspective, of only two weeks, I'm noticing news articles and real world events affect the market a lot more then I was expecting. This is where the stock drops.
What I'm more pleased with is how quickly the bitcoin market recovers from a drop whether it be the Silk Road, a DDoS on Mt. Gox or another major exchange.

Thanks for confirming what I have been observing. This subreddit has been very helpful at helping me understand the ins and outs of the bitcoin market.
It sure has been fun trying to figure out when the market will break the $200 USD mark.

Did Virtex ever resolve your issue?
