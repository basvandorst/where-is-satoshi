If this is possible then yes it's definitely worth it to fix it.  I took it to the local Computer repair and they said they could get it to power on,but didn't have the capabilities to fix it all the way.

As in a back up USB drive?  Unfortunately I don't have one.

I didn't try to bend it back.  When I plugged it in the light didn't turn on and when I tried to reboot while holding option it would go to my regular startup screen no option to go to tails.

If I were to install a new tails on my macbook and create a new electrum wallet can I still recover my old wallet whether by the seed or by fixing the old usb drive?

Thank you and yeah definitely will learn from this costly mistake whether it works out and I recover the wallet or not

I have limited computer/tech knowlefge that's why I'm asking for help and willing to pay a professional

Yeah I'll have to fly back I'm just hoping I can find it it's been 1.5 to 2 years.  I know the general spot where it was,but you never know if someone would toss it on accident thinking it was trash.

Obviously I should've been way more careful, hindsights 20/20.  I found some online sites that say they have a 94% success rate getting data off a broken USB, but I'm not sure that helps since I'll have to load tails off of it.

It was in the usb port of the laptop sitting on my table my dog knocked into which pushed it into a hard vase sitting on the table ( I have a big dog)  I didn't notice it at first the light was still on. When I ejected it I realized it was bent and put it back in my laptop this time it didn't light up.  I included a picture of what the USB drive looks like
