Gtfo. This isn't the place for racist rants.

Been listening to Andreas Antonopoulos all day. He keeps talking about the "other 6 billion'. With the MINIMUM requirement being a Nokia phone with SMS. As you rightly said, it can be a technical nightmare. It is a 5 billion opportunity though!

It's not about Zimbabwe itself. Just wanted to know if it's possible or even technically feasible for Bitcoin itself to reach so many people. Not Blockchain or some cryptocurrency yet to be designed, but Bitcoin itself. 
I just started learning about Bitcoin and the underlying technology. With 16 million Bitcoins already mined and with a limit of just 21 million, I was just wondering how the actual distribution of funds would look like and what the hypothetical exchange value might be at max distribution and miners no longer get rewarded with new bitcoins. 
If it can't be widely used, will Bitcoin itself be a niche currency and eventually collapse?

Ahhh..  Any particularly email you want to call out?  Or are you of the mentality that all the leaks should be labeled as false until we know for certain that every email is verified as true by the very people they incriminate? 
Grow up, man! This is what investigative journalism looks like. This is the job that CNN and MSNBC were supposed to do. But they are too busy sleeping with the politicians and abiding with their every wish for "access".
CNN doesn't even have an investigative journalism department anymore far fucks sake! And they dare call themselves a "news" organization. 
So take your high standards and go protest at the places that matter, the corporate news media who would love nothing more than a dumbed down public.

You living in a hole, mate? Here's just a couple. It's not a tin foil hat theory of its true. 
Hillary becoming President would be an unprecedented disaster. Nothing she does will ever be called out by the media. America might as well rename itself to North Korea then. There's no democracy when the media and the state join hands.

What exactly do you want to find about Trump? He's one giant ball of unelectable behavior. He's a racist, a sexist pig and a total buffoon 
But fortunately for him, he's running against one of the most corrupt and hated 2 faced politicians to ever walk this earth. 
ANY other politician would have been thrashing Trump. Hillary is the only one who can make this a close race.

Yes. Trump is an ineffectual dick. He will have the Republicans AND the Democrats AND a good portion of the public against him. 
Clinton on the other hand is an efficient war hawk with the media on her side and covering for her(as proved by the latest Wikileaks dumps) and will do whatever it takes to bring forth World War 3. And because she is the largest recipient of donations from Arms manufacturers this election cycle. Check out the Podesta emails where she talks about starting wars with both China AND Russia. Whatever you might accuse Trump of doing, Hillary's already done it or is planning on doing it. And that includes building a wall. Or a "fence" as Hillary calls it.

Profitable for the businesses who profit from the war business. Haven't you heard? War is one profitable industry. And no one sells war better than Hillary Clinton. 
And with her statements in the Wikileaks emails where she states quite bluntly about starting war with Russia and China, there is quite literally no doubt anymore as to her true intentions.
Hillary doesn't care about people. She cares about her own power and wealth. As well as the power and wealth of her "friends" aka her sponsors.

They were covering the Wikileaks reveals. The US and UK government definitely don't want that.

Green Party and Jill Stein. The only viable alternative at this point. 
Bernie fucked up by sticking with the corrupt Democratic Party. He should have bailed the moment voter fraud was confirmed and joined the Green Party and accepted Jill Stein's offer.

So you are questioning the motives of Wikileaks and Julian Assange? 
And do you trust CNN more than Wikileaks? 
@_date: 2016-10-18 07:20:13
A lot of supposed conspiracies have been PROVED to be true since the torrent of Wikileaks reveals started coming out. US media is essentially a giant propaganda machine at this point. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 02:47:07
Definitely. I am also a fan of Russell's teapot. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 10:34:00
Because as of 24 hours back, the Internet access of Julian Assange was cut off by "state actors". Would the US and UK government have done anything so drastic if it wasnt true? 
And Hillary validated the emails by referring to her "public" and "private" positions which were revealed through Wikileaks. She brought up the film adaptation of Lincoln iirc. 
There's only so much corruption that can be covered.
