Why is one intangible cryptocurrency made up out of thin air better than any other made up currency? They all have no intrinsic value and the supply is unlimited.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:15:15


Unless the programming variable is changed, in which case the supply is infinite. Once all the coins have been mined the only incentive to sustain bitcoin will be transaction fees which will have to explode. Anyone transacting in bitcoin would have to bear all the mining costs directly (if mining is unprofitable or unincentivized, then no one will mine).
At that point there are many special interests such as miners or anyone that wants transaction costs minimized would welcome increasing new issuance of bitcoin.

Ron Paul didn't endorse cryptocurrency. He specifically said individuals should use something tangible like gold or silver rather than currencies made up out of thin air like the US dollar or bitcoin.
He supports freedom of choice. The freedom of bitcoin speculators to lose their money gambling.

The "limits" are an artificial programming variable that can be changed with a fork. Remember cryptocurrencies are simply a bunch of 0's and 1's of which the supply is infinite. 
There are also thousands of crypto-currencies. Probably new ones being made up out of thin air to cash in the bubble as we speak.

This has been going on for thousands of years. It is how banking works.

Bitcoin is a zero sum game. You can only make money if someone else loses money. Thus, you need to HODL so that others can sell their bitcoins at inflated prices.
The only individuals that are going to end up with a profit in bitcoin are those that got in early and were smart enough to sell at the top to a greater fool such as yourself. 
Many are going to HODL bitcoin all the way back down. I think we'll be under $1,000 soon enough once the panic selling ensues. At that point there will be so many stories of people stuck with losses that the chance of the bubble re-inflating are virtually zero. That would be like people reinvesting their money with Bernie Madoff and giving him a second chance.

There are no fundamentals. Bitcoin is a bunch of 0's and 1's stored across multiple computers. There's no intrinsic values, cash flow, interest, coupon payment, income, or dividend to analyse.

Any brokerage that has a margin account will let you short stocks. Warning: Shorting isn't for the faint of heart. You should read up before you get started. You can go bankrupt since your potential losses are infinite (since a stock can theoretically go to infinity). I only do it for very small positions.

9 years doesn't provide any aura of legitimacy. Bernie Madoff ran a ponzi scheme for 25 years. Bitcoin could be a bubble for 100 years so long as no one attempts to take their "profits" out. Personally I think the bubble has already been pricked as we are down 60% but we will see.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:10:20
I like how the video shows bitcoin in the form of a coin gold as it is frequently marketed in the logo.
Bitcoin is marketed in this way to fraudulently present itself with an illusion of legitimacy. In this way we can pretend that bitcoin is a tangible asset that is valuable to society, just like a gold coin.
In the video, they should have shown a bunch of pieces of paper with 0's and 1's printed out because that's all bitcoin is... a digital coin made up out of thin air.
Unfortunately many HODLers of bitcoin are going to lose a lot of money to find out they are stuck with a bunch of worthless 0's and 1's.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:26:06
No intrinsic value (if you own bitcoin you own a bunch of 0's and 1's made up out of thin air). There are over 3,000 crypto-currencies, many of them are more efficient than bitcoin.

Bitcoin fell and then recovered in the past, therefore it will recover and come back in the future.
Gambler's Fallacy:
"It's not hard to imagine that under certain circumstances, investors or traders can easily fall prey to the gambler's fallacy. For example, some investors believe that they should liquidate a position after it has gone up in a series of subsequent trading sessions because they don't believe that the position is likely to continue going up. Conversely, other investors might hold on to a stock that has fallen in multiple sessions because they view further declines as "improbable". Just because a stock has gone up on six consecutive trading sessions does not mean that it is less likely to go up on during the next session. "

Not at all. You get no direct benefit from Ford generating a profit on a vehicle. And an individual purchase does not influence a market, only aggregates do. 
Also, someone will own any given bitcoin regardless of a decision to buy or not. If you buy bitcoin, then you are simply buying a coin from someone else. Someone still owns it in either situation, and nothing changes in aggregate. 
And of course you can only make money if someone else loses money after taxes, mining, and exchange fees (negative sum game).

Land has intrinsic value. It can be used to develop real estate. It can be used to generate farm income. It can provide a home for someone to live on and satisfaction from use of the land. You can determine the value based on the discounting the cash flows that the property and produce based on income.

"Being a deflationary system, you collect interest by holding it."
The supply in inceasing which is inflationary. That is the definition of inflation. And when the bubble bursts and it loses 95% of its value that is going to be extremely inflationary.
"But if you want to have control of the interest rate (or indeed make a certain loan agreement) then a smart contract of sorts can be employed"
No it can't because bitcoin is too volitale. No one is stupid enough to loan money in terms of bitcoin because it can collapse 80% in value by the time the ink dries.

The costs of mining will having nothing to do with the price over the long run.
That is based on a false belief that mining adds value to society. For example, gold will never fall below the price of mining gold over the long run because demand will eventually push the back up (gold is a valuable asset that people demand for electronics, medicine, aerospace, etc).
On the other hand crypto currency miners are not adding value except for money launders. They are wasting lots of energy and scarce resources to process transactions that could be handled much more efficiently on a platform like Visa or Automated Clearing House transfers.
Thus the price can fall far below the mining costs to the point that miners would actually start to shut down operations and volume falls.

Bitcoin has no intrinsic value -- there is no company ownership, assets, profits, or cash flow. It is literally a bunch of 0's and 1's stored across multiple drives. 
Investing is a positive sum game: A company can incorporate, issue shares to the public, receive capital, use that capital to grow their business, and increase profits. The company and shareholders both win.

Again the past tells you nothing about the future. If that were the case then historians would be the wealthiest individuals on the planet. Anyone making decisions based on that logic deserves to lose their money. In behavioral economics this is called a Gambler's Fallacy: 
"Given the market is irrational and we don't know why it went up or down in the short term, it makes sense to analyse the long term trend since the principles are the same now as they ever have been" 
You falsely assume that bitcoin rising for the last several years is rational and anytime it falls in value is irrational. What if bitcoin rising over the last several years was an irrational bubble, and the recent fall is a rational collapse back to a realistic value? 
After all, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies, the supply is infinite, and there is nothing special about bitcoin except that it was first to the market like MySpace and Sony BetaMax.
