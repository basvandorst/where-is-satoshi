This is to look like they're doing something with the tax money we give them. Since they're obviously too lazy and cowardly to go after real criminals, they just terrorize these harmless drug users. Sad.

There was no murder-for-hire. 
Does it make sense now?

Please tell me he wrote this like a year ago. I thought the blocksize debate was progressing in recent weeks behind the scenes. Why is this guy talking about lowering the blocksize? Does he really want to restart the argument from the beginning? I'm starting to wonder if this is intentional stonewalling.
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:01:32
It was so obvious as soon as as saw his comment. I'm surprised more people didn't call him out. You would think these government agents have something better to do than shilling on reddit for their failed war on drug users. I guess they caught all the pedos and ISIS has been dismantled?

Doctors part of big pharma. Encouraged to over-prescribe. Well documented.
@_date: 2015-04-17 16:10:27
Hope so. Not only that but the location of the Silk Road server was obtained illegally so the whole conviction should be thrown out.

Good. I hope there's a mistrial. Not that it matters anyway, the whole trial is a sham. You can't use illegally obtained evidence to send someone to prison. At least you're aren't supposed to in America. No one seems to care that the Feds **illegally obtained** the location of the Silk Road server.
@_date: 2015-03-31 14:49:42

Let him wallow in his delusion. It provides lurkers like me a great deal of amusement.
@_date: 2015-03-27 14:59:16
So your name doesn't match the name on the bank account? What did they "dig" up exactly? 
Sounds like they are looking for red flags and resolving them before the Feds do it for them and shut down everything. Props to them for being proactive. 
TL;DR:If you need to do shady stuff, you shouldn't use Coinbase or Circle.

Keep up the good fight. The LE trolls will try to steer every conversation away from the illegally obtained evidence to "murder-for-hire" nonsense.

They should walk if the evidence was obtained illegally. That's how the American justice system is supposed to work.
