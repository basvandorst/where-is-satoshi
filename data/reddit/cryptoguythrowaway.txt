I use BitStamp, CampBx, and MtGox.
You have to be careful with MtGox though because if your order isn't filled there's basically no way to get your USD out.

You can pay a few thousand to take it to a clean room for deep data recovery.  Would be worth it.

Or if you're 14 you shouldn't be making serious investments against your parents will?
I mean it's probably your parents money to begin with.  If they give you shit just drop it and focus on school.
Yeah I'm sure there's some 14 year old geniuses out there who could handle the pressure of investing, but most kids can't and shouldn't be worried about shit like this.  Focus on school and puberty don't get caught up in this shit.
Keep in mind if you're going behind their back or investing directly, there's a lot of legal and tax problems you're going to face.  Most exchanges and transmitters can't legally work with you unless you're over 18.
Also you're investment is fucking risky.  Don't act like you know something adults don't.  Bitcoin has crashed before and it could crash again and you'll probably panic sell and lose money.

I don't really get the harm in having two identical crypto currencies.
It allows for faster arbitrage and it just seems like a nice extra option to BTC if one is being more stable than the other.
Their APIs are so similar that there's literally no reason to not accept LTC if you accept BTC and there's no risk if you're converting it directly.
If I might counter your suspicion, I think people who are anti-LTC and only anti-LTC because they think it will hurt their BTC investment.  I think it's just the opposite though.  I think have lots of functioning crypto currencies really allows for more stability since each one can test out it's own thing which BTC can then pull from or use.
Other cryptos make mining more appealing too since you can merge mine and that's good for the network overall.
I think you're being small minded and there's a lot of room for many currencies in the market.  I don't invest in LTC directly but I do use it frequently for arbitrage and I mine on it as a hobby (converting to BTC directly though).

Honestly don't think this is major.  It's already leveling out.  Even if it hits $800 I see it rebounding before the days over.
The $1000 news is too big people will see the crash as an advantage to buy in.
I put an order to sell at $1000 and buy at $900 but I don't think it's going to get filled honestly.

This is just money I play with.  I'm fine cashing it out honestly if I have to.

There's actually already a lot of advantages of having a second blockchains.  It create stability for testing new methods live, it allows for arbitrage without dealing with fiat, it can further anonmize your money by move between blockchains, it makes mining more appealing since you can merged mine (which HELPS the BTC network), and allows for safe trading while one is experiencing a fork or instability.
During the BTC fork I was paid in LTC which really saved my ass while my transactions were correcting.
I don't think they're competing at all so I don't see the harm.  I think people are being hypocritical and are just afraid that LTC is going to hurt their BTC investment but don't see how it could actually help it greatly.

Also BTC used to be 99.999999% speculation.  People are treating LTC just like they treated BTC in the early days.  The hypocrisy is really daunting.

And now it's up 50%+.
