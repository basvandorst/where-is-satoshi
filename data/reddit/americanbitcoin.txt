Because Coindesk is not at all transparent and is hardly a real journalistic source. From their advertising page: "We are currently only working with selected advertising partners." They don't want you to know they've taken money from scam companies like BFL to write positive articles.
Long story short, Lawsky knew that Coindesk would give him a draft copy of the article before it went live to make sure that it painted him in a more favorable light. He didn't like the beatdown he got on r/bitcoin when he posted the regs.

It's deceitful to use the Uganda video for promotion. This is why:
**TL;DR:** The local "exchange" Ronald initially used is no longer/was never in business. He can't change his Bitcoin into local currency.
“It was a guy, downtown doing mobile money business,” says Ronald by Facebook. He sold bitcoin to the guy twice. “Though after a couple of days, I went back to the same guy but I found he had closed. Then this girl who used to work with him told me he had better things to do and that he did not have a lot of customers. And the lady told me he used part of the employer’s money in his bitcoin deals and when the boss [realized] that the guy was using his money in his personal deals, he fired him.”
So now Ronald’s one exchange is out of business. Ronald still has some Bitcoin but he can’t turn them into dollars. So it’s basically the useless currency that many used to accuse it of being in the U.S. “I hope with time I will find a way of exchanging the bitcoin I was left with to cash,” he says.

The government probably will not need to intervene because it's unlikely this will even work, unless they are willing to convert fiat to MazaCoin on the spot (for visitors, at least). 
It would have been smarter to make it an alternative currency and slowly integrate/adopt it over time. It could have been done fairly quickly, but a cold turkey approach will probably end in failure.

I'm a little surprised that this hasn't been adopted already, considering how long Bitcoin has been at the $100+ level. Having 8 decimal places is totally unnecessary and makes it confusing for mainstream acceptance.
It's such an easy fix that would make the entire system a lot more user friendly to first time coin holders. 
The same people will call Bitcoin a scam whether the decimal places are changed or not. Anyone calling the change a scam has about the same credibility as CNN calling Jon Matonis the Executive Director of Bitcoin.

Buffett has likely read up on the basics of Bitcoin, and may even personally own a modest amount, but it's unlikely he's invested a whole lot of time understanding the novel technology behind it. He's much more likely to spend his time reading buried in annual reports than do the research that is currently necessary to fully understand how Bitcoin works and why it has value. You can't fault him for that.
He has a reputation for not being heavily invested in any high-tech industries (he almost "brags" about it, in fact). Much of Berkshire's success in recent years comes from his partner, Charlie Munger.
As Bitcoin continues to grow, Buffett will take another look. He admits when he's wrong.

Well done Erik. Very well-written article. 
This legislation is archaic and must not be implemented. It is not at all "focused" as promised by Mr. Lawsky - rather, it is a broad set of shackles that applies to any business that wishes to develop products and services that integrate Bitcoin technology.
OF COURSE the Winklevoss twins have thrown their support behind this. They probably helped write it. After all, they've chosen to jump through all the regulation hoops themselves. Why shouldn't others have to do it too?
It just creates a bigger moat for their business. The entire purpose of this legislation is to entrench the status quo.
One piece I didn't see you mention (or I may have missed) is the fact that BitLicense businesses are required to maintain ALL of their profits/retained earnings in USD dollars. Among many other things, this clearly prevents the rise of Bitcoin as a true reserve currency.
To claim that this legislation is "balanced" is absolutely absurd. It is Anti-Bitcoin and Orwellian.

I set up a savings account about 15 years ago with my Dad, long before I was 18. I only stored a modest amount of money in there (~$500) to keep the account open and to access in an emergency.
Today, I just happened to open up a statement and saw I was being billed $3 quarterly for a "low balance fee." The fee was about 100x the interest I earned on the account over the same period.

I agree that the majority of Buffett's investments now are only possible due to the fact he's a whale. 
Benjamin Graham should get most the credit for Buffett's success. Buffett really just took a few well-researched big bets on companies with good fundamentals: bought dividend-paying companies when the markets hated them and held onto them.
The float afforded to him by GEICO (probably his best bet) also allows him to use "free money" to use for his investments.

Be well prepared and know your stuff about how it all works. Insurance companies try to avoid risk at all costs, so you're going to have a hard time convincing them unless you can answer questions about how the technology works. 
Your best bet is to let them know that there's very little risk to the bottom line, as it's a form of convenience for customers that will attract a rapidly growing market. 
Show them that it's growing in popularity rapidly. There was just a news article about how [Bitcoin is overtaking Paypal in transaction volume](
They don't need to worry about large price fluctations because the Bitcoin is immediately converted into cash for them if they so choose. And because they likely wouldn't be holding any amount of Bitcoin, it couldn't be hacked or otherwise stolen from them either. 
You should also let them know that larger companies have successfully negotiated further reduced fees (which are already low - generally 1% or less) with companies like Coinbase, making it far cheaper and easier to accept than credit card payments. They also bend over backwards to help companies integrate it into their systems, so the outlay to get it setup shouldn't be too high either.

Yes, you got it. It's pretty easy to do, especially when you aren't hooking into any digital platforms/software. You can just setup payment buttons using a service like Coinbase, it's as easy as setting up an account and getting your ID verified.
Type in the amount in USD that you want to charge, and Coinbase will automatically convert it to the appropriate BTC price for you. And, it can convert the sales instantly to fiat so there's minimal exposure risk to the Bitcoin market.
I hope that helps. The more use of Bitcoin, the better, and it will give you and your Dad a bit of a marketing edge.

I don't know for sure, but even a modest increase in their customer base produces a lot of returns. Remember that these companies aren't just measuring the dollar value of their current sales, they often measure based on how much each customer brings in the door over the course of their lifetime.

They will do or say anything that promotes their self-interest.
That applies to most companies, organizations and people, but it's a little more interesting when they're willing to use a "nonpartisan think tank" to bash the coin and it's users.
Think about it this way: Many banks consider Bitcoin enough of a "threat" to their business that they're willing to invest real dollars to try to impede it's growth. 
Even if these companies would normally donate to the ThinkProgress organization without any of the Bitcoin hub bub, they chose to expend the political points they have (earned through donations) by having articles written to fight the legitimacy of Bitcoin.

I signed up for an account...I'm pretty skeptical because of the conversion fees. It's only 0.45% as advertised for BTC to USD conversions. For the euro, pound, and the yen it's 0.95%, and for the Yuan it's 2.0%.
The bigger problem, is that I think **it double charges you.** You get charged once for making the conversion into the chosen currency, and then when you choose to spend your deposit, it charges you to convert it back into Bitcoin to spend off the site.
I think you can avoid it if the other person has a Bitreserve account and you transfer it to them, but I'm not even sure about that. And then they'll have to pay to convert it when they transfer it or spend it.
Great business model for Bitreserve, sounds like they're going to make a lot of money skimming off the top, but if I'm getting charged those fees twice I'm going to avoid it as a user.

Ignore the snide responses, I don't understand the holier than thou attitude in this subreddit.
Bitcoin is a good hedge against inflation and a lot easier to buy, sell and transfer than gold. Banking is necessary and will not go away, but you should know that your money can be taken away from you, and it may happen literally overnight. There's a reason our great-grandparents stuffed their cash in a mattress instead of a bank account.
Most recently, the IMF has written a report that discusses how to reduce debt burdens of at risk countries, with the possibility of a one-off "capital levy" on the deposits held by citizens of indebted countries, up to 10% of all household deposits - not just those of high-net worth:


If the government inflates your currency to oblivion to pay off its debt, you have a backup. It's interesting to note the sharp increases in the price of Bitcoin around the time of the financial crisis in Cyprus. If you look at the numbers of governments worldwide, you can see the writing on the wall.    
Even if Bitcoin is 100% banned worldwide (a very, very unlikely scenario) it will still be used in the black market for legal and illegal products and services. More importantly, it will serve as a token used to facilitate actions in the decentralized cloud - which will continue to grow much larger, much faster.
The reason I care about Bitcoin so much is that there is so much more that can be done with it (particularly the tech) than meets the eye.

"It's easy for technologists to only want to focus on the technology aspect and how the company is being disruptive on that level. **But sort of the part that is not as fun is dealing with regulation and getting all your ducks in a row.** But it's also really sort of the most important parts," Winklevoss said. **"The people who are not complying will lose their bank account and be shut down very quickly."**
Yeah...it isn't fun...good thing you guys have all the resources that you need to make the regulatory process a hell of a lot easier.
Blindly supporting these regulations has already put a wet blanket on all Bitcoin startups in New York, whether they're trying to be an exchange or merely develop software for the Bitcoin ecosystem.
But, who cares about anyone else...you've already got all your ducks in a row, right?

PEORIA — A Normal man has been sentenced to four years in federal prison for running an unlicensed, multimillion-dollar bitcoin exchange on the Internet.
Chief U.S. District Judge James E. Shadid sentenced John D. Powell 55, to 48 months in federal prison and to serve three years of supervised release following his incarceration.
On July 31, Powell entered an open plea of guilty to two counts of operating an unlicensed money service business. He was sentenced last week. 
It was the first such case prosecuted by the U.S. attorney for the Central District of Illinois, said that office.
Bitcoin is a cybercurrency that allows individuals to conduct transactions anonymously. According to court documents, Powell’s exchange business allowed individuals increased anonymity by exchanging cash anonymously for bitcoin.
Investigators found that Powell received more than $3 million from individuals during an 18-month period ending in February 2014, according to the U.S. attorney's office.

No, but as it stands, obtaining even a trivial amount of Bitcoin is virtually impossible without buying it for fiat (in one way or another). 
The best way to figure out how to use Bitcoin is to actually get experience using it: sending and receiving coin. If the average consumer finds it difficult to get even a small amount, then it's adoption slows down.

Legislation that targets currency manipulation might make or break U.S. President Barack Obama’s signature Pacific trade deal. But calling out offenders for currency transgressions is far from a clear-cut exercise.
U.S. lawmakers, companies and unions are trying to use pending trade legislation to strike back at countries they say subsidize their industries through devalued exchange rates. They’re finding themselves entangled in a decadeslong debate about currency valuations that has bedeviled leading institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization. The complicated currency calculus is likely to persist well beyond any deal, stymieing attempts to rein in exchange-rate complaints through arbitration or diplomacy.
Some U.S. lawmakers are channeling their constituents’ long-held grievances by pressing to incorporate enforceable currency provisions into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed 12-nation free-trade deal tying together 40% of the global economy. Legislators from manufacturing-heavy states in particular—such as Michigan, Ohio and New York—worry that TPP members and potential future partners such as South Korea and China could offset any gains made through the pact by depreciating their currencies.

A weaker currency slashes production costs and fuels exports, at the expense of competitors overseas. Some economists and companies, for example, say China’s managed exchange-rate policy over the past decade cost the U.S. millions of jobs as Beijing subsidized its exporters by keeping the value of the yuan as much as 40% below the level market fundamentals would suggest.
“Currency manipulation is the mother of all trade barriers,” said Stephen Biegun, a vice president of international government affairs for Ford Motor Co. Ford, like other U.S. auto makers, is backing lawmaker proposals to punish countries that depreciate their currencies to gain a competitive advantage. The firm is particularly concerned about Japan, one of the largest car markets in the world and a TPP negotiating partner.
“We can compete with any car manufacturer in the world, but we can’t compete against the Bank of Japan,” Mr. Biegun said, referring to the central bank’s role in driving down the value of Japan’s currency under previous governments.
Even if U.S. lawmakers’ currency proposals are passed into law, determining the fair value of a currency is a major complication likely to frustrate their efforts to sanction trading partners.
Christopher Padilla, a former Commerce Department undersecretary for international trade, said calculating a currency’s appropriate value would be close to impossible, and create insurmountable operational challenges.
“Ask ten different economists for the ‘objective’ market value of a foreign currency, and you will get ten different answers—all well-argued and backed by econometric analysis, but all different,” Mr. Padilla, now a vice president of government and regulatory affairs for IBM, wrote recently.
GOP lawmakers who support trade legislation have latched onto that argument to fend off congressional Democrats. “To think that Congress can legislate what currency valuations are between countries is almost laughable,” House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) said last week. He noted that lawmakers have been debating the issue for decades.
The IMF is designed to get around political debates, serving as the world’s independent assessor of exchange-rate policies. Founded in the wake of World War II, the organization’s goal was to prevent another global conflict in part by promoting stable currency regimes.
IMF rules prohibit the fund’s 188 member countries from manipulating their exchange rates to gain a competitive advantage. But the fund has never officially declared a country in violation of that prohibition. The fund’s legal department said the prohibition “is a relatively complex provision and not all of its terms are easily understood, or easily applied.”
The latest currency debate presents a circular problem: The leading proposals from U.S. lawmakers rely on the IMF’s determinations. Legislation sponsored by Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) would allow the U.S. to treat undervalued currencies as a subsidy, and subsequently apply duties on imports from that country in retaliation.
If trading partners challenged the U.S., as they likely would, the dispute would be arbitrated by the World Trade Organization. The WTO, in turn, looks to the IMF’s expertise on exchange rates.
The IMF, however, is far from precise in those calculations.
Over the past several years, it has been trying to develop new ways to measure currency values that member countries and economists could broadly agree indicate how much exchange rates were undervalued or overvalued. Their answer was to publish a range of possible valuations for major currencies based on several methodologies. The result: a wide range of valuations that, in some cases, contradict themselves.
In a report last year on major economies, for instance, the fund estimated the Japanese yen was between 15% overvalued and 15% undervalued in 2013. As U.S. auto companies and lawmakers seek to counter alleged damage from Japan’s policies, the IMF’s data showing overvaluation would give Tokyo a strong counterargument. It shows the IMF can be of two minds on the value of the yen, and other currencies.
The data also could raise questions about why U.S. car makers have struggled to compete with Toyota and other Japanese manufacturers, even after those companies have opened plants in the U.S. in part to nullify exchange-rate and trade-sanction issues.
The IMF’s double-minded assessment of currency values goes beyond Japan.
South Korea’s won was between 5% and 20% undervalued, it estimated. The Hong Kong dollar was somewhere between 10% undervalued and 10% overvalued. The U.S. dollar was estimated to be 5% undervalued to 10% overvalued. The IMF’s next report, due in coming weeks, will likely show significant changes in the 2014 data.
The IMF is also at odds with the U.S. on China’s currency. While the fund says the yuan is approaching equilibrium after nearly a decade of appreciation, U.S. Treasury officials say it’s still substantially undervalued.
And last week IMF economists signaled again South Korea’s won may be undervalued. But in the same breath, the IMF’s executive board undercut the critique: “Methodological shortcomings amplify the uncertainty surrounding such an assessment.”
Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former U.S. trade official, said passage of congressional currency provisions could set the stage for China and other countries to bring a case challenging the U.S. at the WTO. It’s uncertain how the WTO would rule, and “China could mount a strong case,” he said.
The White House—wanting the Pacific trading partners to sign a deal, but needing the votes of a pack of lawmakers pushing for currency legislation—is backing a separate proposal by Sen. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) that seeks to bolster U.S. oversight of trading-partner exchange rates.
It would apply far tamer sanctions. And in line with the long history of broad interpretations of currency levels, it would give the White House wide latitude to assess countries’ exchange-rate policies and the appropriate punishments.

To answer your question, I came to the conclusion that merge-mining was required due to the fact it was mentioned while talking about potential drawbacks, mining centralization starting at line 343, section 4.3. I read the following paragraphs to mean that merge-mining is the best potential solution to the problem of validating several sidechains, but there is nothing there specifically that says that.
I also read a couple articles that had worded it in a similar way.

The money exchange features of Bitcoin are only one piece of the big picture. The "BAM!" moment for me was when I realized that the blockchain concept is the most novel piece of the technology. Decentralized corporations/organizations that serve the human good are the future: Think self-driving cars that are virtually impossible to hack.
There are lots and lots of fringe benefits to Bitcoin the more you dig into it. Just one example: Your money cannot be ripped out of your account by anyone if it's held on a physical wallet, not an online one.
There are lots of reasons that Bitcoin has value and will become widely adopted. Keep digging and you'll become an addict.

"Fostering innovation"...oy. Having 51% of the network (or more) will certainly allow you to be innovative. To me this post sounds like a rationalization for you to try to scale up your operations further.
I don't understand why there has to be some sort of "round table meeting," especially when you monopolize the industry and, as you stated in your post above, need to look out for your own interests (to be "innovative.") **Any actions taken at the "round table" will likely further cement your position as a monopoly.**
To put me (as a prior customer of cex.io) at ease, the solution is as simple as imposing a mining fee when your hash rate on the network is 50% or higher. Make it a public concrete policy. 
When you say a mining fee "contradicts the principles of your operation" I hear "we want to grow as large as possible." To be willing to forgo mining fee profits in exchange for greater control of the network suggests there is something malicious at play.
Your post has me more worried than I was before.

Interested in using Payza. Can you clarify these questions for me?
- Do I need a separate merchant account, or are credit card payments processed directly through your company at the fees listed below?
- If payments are processed directly through you, am I correct in assuming that incoming credit card payments are billed at 4.99 % + $ 0.59 receiving fee as indicated at the bottom asterisk of the fees page?
- For accepting Bitcoin payments, it looks like payments go to a wallet that Payza controls. Are users charged both the 2.50 % + $0.25 USD when accepting payments via Bitcoin, and then an additional 2% fee for withdrawing to a personal wallet (for a total of 4.5% + $0.25)?
I saw the 2.5% + $0.25 USD fee and got excited, since that beats Paypal's fee structure...but if I'm correct in my assumptions above, it wouldn't be economically beneficial to switch at this point.
Thanks for clarifying.
