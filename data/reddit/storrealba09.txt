Also Government: “Drugs are illegal”
  Stopped? That would be a nice privacy challenge to break in.

Please no Bcash shilling

If we follow the real price action (not price vs time)* we are still in a downtrend. Also, technical analysis on 1w just had an local top, so no FUD no shit. Just TA and be patient enough, wait for a bottom in 1w chart. 
*watch RENKO charts

Having 0.1 BTC means that you are (at least)  among with the 210,000,000 top holders

Fellow Venezuelan here. 
Keep doing good! Los buenos somos más!

It’s probably already happening and no one notices

There’s an assumption that each channel can carry 500 tx/s so there’s around 7000 channels.

After reading all of this, I agree with the fact that scaling it’s necessary but as far I know a second layer doesn’t prevent bigger blocks too so bigger blocks are possible in BTC through a consensus, right? So a this point I see BCH senseless

It’s Bitcoin, not blockchain. Blockchain it’s just a slow and expensive database.

SegWit and MultiSig addresses start with 3

Can’t agree more with this. Venezuelans are a real case use for BTC, currency controls? Now There’s is a Bitcoin-related index  (USD&gt;BTC&gt;VEF) and more and more people are buying and hold. Also it’s cheap way to send money from abroad imagine sons who left the country sending money to their parents for living (that’s what I’ve been doing), it’s quite common.
So all of this just means that Bitcoin is really anti censorship and Venezuelan govt can’t do nothing about. 
“Venezuelans are fleeing their country and taking the knowledge of Bitcoin with them. It's a tool for fighting bad monetary policy.”
   That’s another thing: it’s kinda disappointing the fact that you tell someone in USA “I survived communism thanks to bitcoin” and they don’t know about it or even worse they know but they don’t have idea about the use cases, they just know about speculation. So yep, spreading the word via this kind of testimonials is really good for BTC.

It’s not impossible to buy/sell bitcoins there. As I understand they’ll just raise money and just give it to Venezuelans in order to (somehow) improve their lives and economy. An attempt to ‘bitcoinize’ a failed economy

So basically Bitcoin made by miners for miners

Trust no one, that’s the point of crypto currency. Did Credit Suisse consider Lightning? If the answer is no, that study doesn’t worth even the time to read it.

Definitively it’s the best time to get started in bitcoin. With so much improvement on going and price in the bottom (for some) it’s a good time. Just have a plan
