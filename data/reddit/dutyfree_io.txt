They should normally tax it at the border, but they never do.
@_date: 2016-04-04 19:05:42
download the installer again - the one you have might be corrupted

See you on the other side :)

Did someone say [cigarettes](
@_date: 2016-04-05 09:19:44
you mean the  handle?
@_date: 2016-04-16 10:27:58
We're selling cheap smokes at ** If that ain't cool, I don't know what is! 
 or ob://fdc42aedd18c03f10f8d5a842a4513cf05f7fe20/store
@_date: 2016-04-05 13:16:29
This was our first OB order ever - thank you so much!! :)
And sorry for the connection issues, our OB server got disconnected for the time being, now it's back up.
It'd be amazing if you could leave us your review when the smokes arrive. Thanks again!
@_date: 2016-04-04 22:11:25
There's not much of outside interference (even for very illegal substances), that's the thing. Our service, however, is completely legal.
@_date: 2016-04-06 13:40:33
fuck hearn
@_date: 2016-04-04 22:27:22
We also go by  :)
@_date: 2016-04-05 15:36:06
No, it is completely legal as long as it's for your personal consumption.
@_date: 2016-04-11 15:33:05
Yeah, join us there.
@_date: 2016-04-05 09:28:26
Congratulations everyone, this launch really is a big deal! We're shipping cigarettes worldwide and we go by the ** handle or **fdc42aedd18c03f10f8d5a842a4513cf05f7fe20**. See you on OpenBazaar! :)
@_date: 2016-04-04 18:35:52
This is the biggest thing since Bitcoin itself!
My OB ID is fdc42aedd18c03f10f8d5a842a4513cf05f7fe20 and I ship cigarettes worldwide. Let the fun begin!
Congratulations to the whole team! :)

I do have it, it's

You can buy some cigarettes as well - fdc42aedd18c03f10f8d5a842a4513cf05f7fe20
Ah, soap, cigarettes, reminds me of jail! /s
@_date: 2016-04-05 22:38:15
We also go by the  handle.
@_date: 2016-04-05 12:21:58
There is tobacco on offer as well: fdc42aedd18c03f10f8d5a842a4513cf05f7fe20

your average XT adopter right here ^
great argumentation too, as usual.
@_date: 2015-08-16 10:12:57
bon voyage!

Do you support Jeff Garzik's BIP 100?
@_date: 2015-08-10 04:43:28
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:18:25
Awesome? It's fucking ridiculous if you ask me.
@_date: 2015-08-16 10:22:57
The real consensus will be reached in no time once some idiot merchant / exchange decides to accept xt instead of Bitcoin.

Welcome back!
@_date: 2016-10-20 18:44:40
Point out what exactly?
@_date: 2016-10-20 12:06:25
Time to fire that Bitcoin CEO!
@_date: 2016-10-10 10:03:30
No such thing, sigh. I guess the agreements they have with their payment gateways wouldn't allow this anyway...
This is why we've set up an [info page]( to guide people through the process of buying Bitcoin, for example.
@_date: 2016-10-20 18:38:42
Sorry, but what do you mean? It only takes a couple of minutes to download, run and find your way around it - I find it much much more usable and user-friendly than, say, eBay.
@_date: 2015-11-07 15:55:30
At least we're done here.
@_date: 2015-11-18 11:08:37
There's no way we can get our hands on it, unfortunately :(
@_date: 2017-05-14 10:35:14




Can you please do it for me :(
@_date: 2015-11-17 20:46:06
I know, right? Can't wait to offer insane discounts on [Dutyfree.io]( :)
