BTC-E never got any requests from the hacker to keep continue to remove 2FA. Like I mentioned, they should have kept 2FA if they weren't sure. 
I absolutely should have changed my password but I had no idea. I don't even think it was the SAME password at BTC-E!

I don't know 100%, but when I finally regained control over my account and BTC-E in their benevolence decided to send me the hackers information, they never mentioned anything about conflicting requests. 
Also, the hacker can't monitor my gmail all day.
They only hacked it to change passwords and withdraw money, which are instant.

They never emailed BTC-E, BTC-E had no way of knowing they had control of my email address. if they even a little unsure, they should have kept 2FA on. 
Also, when reviewing my account they could have seen someone had logged in from Romania and changed my password, which would be an obvious sign of a compromised account.

Thank you. 
I have 2FA on my email now. 
However, this STILL could have been 100% prevented if BTC-E were even somewhat competent enough to actually monitor the situation and determine what to do in the TWO WEEKS that my account was locked! 
It's like they have 2 guys sitting there, one collecting all the money, and the other writing back emails with half sentences in google translated english.

What list?
April Fools?

I had it on both! I am realizing now they must have had access to my email and BTC-E the entire time.... some lessons are cheaper than others. This one cost me 500 bucks.

Could be sooner!

This is huge. Please RT it. Peterson has many millions of fans who are precisely the demographic of future bitcoiners.

Just teasing you. Little cranky because I'm down 40%.......TODAY!
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:46:10
LOL, had to read that twice. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:33:12
check out my balance 
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:47:02
I buy from Coinbase.com and trade on BTC-E! 
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:57:23
I hope your right!

I think these are the constructive insults I was looking for.

Hope these searches have money to put in!

I sold near what I paid on PPC and NMC and used it to buy LTC at around 22... LTC is the winner most of the time. 
Thank you though.

It is an above average market return, but crypocurrencies have about the  odds of playing red on the roulette wheel. You can lose 25% of your money in a day, so given the risk, I don't think 15% is that impressive. 
I only started with 600 bucks. So, not nearly enough money to remove. 
Totally got greedy, I'm in for 1200 now, after telling myself that I had no problem losing it, I actually realized I no longer want to lose it. 
Thanks for the advice. I think i'm going to hold until its back, and then get out even or up a little and start fresh and conservative. :)

Hmm... if I bought at 750 and I sell, i'm losing 100 pts. If I rebuy and it goes back to 750 i'm even (as I would be if I never sold). 
Basically, between the two I would rather hold then gaurentee a loss in order to break even. 
I guess I don't think it will go down much more.

And we kill those people! 
P.S. I made almost all my money back.
