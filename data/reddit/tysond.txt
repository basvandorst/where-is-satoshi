What are you saying by store, it is its own Cryptocurrency not relying on the ISO 4712. If the military were to take it away then government, banks and Corporations would be held responsible for damages done to not the enviornment, economy, nature preservation as well as the person(s), family(s) or even another country (citizen's of country A takes away citizen's of Country B's Bitcoin due to a war or conflict). Corperations do not even have access to regulate bitcoin. Bitcoin is not the new way to store money as It is a Cash to Cashless system. It is technology that can be used to buy and sell gold bars, buy and sell real estate as well as stocks. Think of nuclear weapons and Bitcoin and you have a not for military usage answer. Bitcoin runs on the laws of mathmatics.

I will pay that VAT in BTC/XBT but BTC/XBT is not taxable unless it is their law, not bitcoin's law.
