Not hardly, "The Banks" represent most of the Power, Wealth and Information in the world, you think they won't completely stamp Bitcoin out as soon as it becomes a real threat?

Require a minimum of two keys, generate two without passwords, totally off network, put one in a safe deposit box, put the other under the carpet at your moms house?

In the mathematics that bitcoin is built on. If you could easily generate this address on demand, you could easily regenerate any address on demand.

If anyone interested was capable of doing it, they would just do it. You don't think awesome programmers are just sitting around waiting for some dope on the internet to think up a "great idea" so they can code it, do you?

That slowness is the extra cookies the FBI injected, phoning home.
*this is tongue in cheek - otherwise someone will feel the need to tell me that's not how it works, and how stupid I am.

I never said anything about bitcoin, only tor. Google the exploit that the FBI used recently to compromise anonymity.
