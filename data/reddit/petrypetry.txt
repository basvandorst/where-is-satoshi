I am currently undertaking a research project for my Bachelor's Degree in Business and Management. My research subject is "Awareness and attitudes towards ethical issues in the cryptocurrency industry". Currently, most of my data is from individuals with no experience of cryptocurrencies. So, it would be very interesting for me to get some data from you guys, who are actively involved in cryptocurrencies - to help compare if there is a difference. If you have two minutes, please take my Google Forms survey below - Thanks a lot! Happy to get some feedback as well.

Happy to take this thought onboard in my analysis and could consider that as one of the critical reflections of my study! I got these issues from my research into academic literature about the subject so it is not popular media alone though. Thanks for the point of view, it's helpful!

Basically, which of those ethical problems were you the least aware about, or has been least talked about in the media. Maybe I need to re-phrase it (or add an extra option). Thanks for pointing it out!

Great points! I don't think my undergraduate level business research will get to public domain. Originally, I wanted to research how cryptocurrency investing/trading has changed investing style of millennials. However, my research tutor declined my proposal, calling it too ambitious and for the difficulty of ethically gathering data. In the end, I went to the ethical direction more for practical reasons as my work for my research proposal brought up lots of these academic articles about ethical issues (especially ones about energy consumption of crypto mining) and thus I already had lot of literature ready.
