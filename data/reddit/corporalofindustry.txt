Or maybe they should simply ban you and people like you? Just brainstorming here.

Libertarians think company towns are a good thing because in their fantasies they are the ones running the company.

Praise Satoshi! I still remember how bad it was BWP (Before the White Paper), when you had to apply for innovation permits first.

This is why bitcoin transactions are instant and you certainly don't have to wait 60 minutes to avoid double spends!
@_date: 2015-06-25 08:23:00
But I was assured by the good people in this very sub that bitcoin has no fees!
@_date: 2015-06-23 01:13:20
So what he's saying is that bitcoin cannot survive on an even playing field?

The work history of most people in this sub consists of mowing the neighbors' lawns for pocket money.

I've just made several huge breakthroughs in genetics and biological computing, instead of doing something useful and valuable with these things I think I'll just dabble with butts a bit!

I don't think the MtGox TOS said anything specific about how Mark was to keep track of the funds.

It's all in the wiki.

I don't think this has been established at all.

The developed world stopped using checks around 1990.

So? Where's the contract he supposedly broke?

Two more middlemen, what a bargain.
@_date: 2015-08-13 20:09:22
You're an ignorant moron, hth.
@_date: 2015-08-25 00:00:14
It's almost as if the markets do not see Bitcoin as a real competitor to the current financial system!

Reminder, like Ethereum, Storj and Maidsafe, side chains are also fairy dust.

The stick symbolises bitcoin and the park is a metaphor for a good, productive life?

Your post is about to be invaded by grammar Nazi's
@_date: 2015-07-10 08:19:36


Lol, the opposite of reality. Does your striking ignorance ever bother you?
@_date: 2015-09-04 01:12:41
That's just sad. "Your honor, my public server was incapable of adequately performing the one task it was intended to do, please punish these people I don't like."
@_date: 2015-09-04 09:54:34
It's called learning.
@_date: 2015-09-17 19:58:39
No, I'll level with you. You're the one who's lost. Like so many libertarians, you stick to a childlike literalist black and white worldview where the free market is viewed as a supernatural godlike entity that can do no wrong. When provided evidence to the contrary, you will  invariably resort to a semantical no true Scotsman defense that will convince no-one. Don't doom yourself to an intellectually and socially stunted life. Let go of your superstitious beliefs in an all-powerful, all-good free market. Let the healing begin.

I think you meant "the guy above".

Lol, the teaming up and buying off govts is a direct consequence of the free market. This is why libertarians get constantly laughed at.

Unlike bit coin, professionally designed financial networks do not simply fold and die every time somebody actually uses them for their intended purpose.
