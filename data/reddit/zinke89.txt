Hey man, new here, but from what I understand, you’re supposed to buy a Ledger Nano S, load up the coin you want to “fork” and put it in the a freezer or somewhere cold, which is why it’s called “cold storage”, once it “incubates” for 7-9 days the coins hatch or “cold fork”. A shit fork is the same process but instead of the freezer or cold place it’s a warm place, I just use my butt, which is why it’s called “shit fork”.
Good luck man, exciting times. 2 the mars!
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:52:59
Anything under -5 degrees is technically considered cold storage. I got myself an ice cube tray from amazon and just put my ledger in one of the cube spots. Works fine so far and as far as I know, my btc value was preserved. Good luck man!

I still don't understand why anyone would want to short bitcoin enough to annihilate it. If anything, these people are smart enough to pump the price astronomically high over a period and cash out over time making a whole lot more money than shorting it to 0.

Just badly designed, looks like it was thrown together in a night. If you're going to develop a site for people to transact digital currency, that site better look beautiful with all questions answered in an FAQ. Also having it SSL secured from entrance to exit is imperative. People hold way more of a value on their bitcoins than they actually paid for them. Don't expect people to just sign up and give you their information (although a site like this will STILL somehow get people signing up and giving you their private information, go figure)
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:44:35
Agreed. If you look into the involved addresses per transaction, some have upwards of 500 different addresses involved.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:15:19
But don’t you think the legitimate hodlers would wait for a drop like this and stock up on as much as possible? Thus driving price upward?

I think having an active, well maintained, and open distro on Github is a great start. If the idea is beneficial to users I’m sure you will attract attention, suggestions, and assistance as needed. Your concept phase will most definitely give you some insight as to what the community requires as far as transparency and usability. Would love to have a look once you start working, I built something similar in a concept phase trying to utilize Robinhood’s API, but at the time the API was closed.

Wondering what the process would be here. You have the address, and they can move that coin around to multiple addresses now, and you can follow each one.
Would like to know if there is anything that can actually be done in this situation besides just watching your coins bounce from address to address.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:34:01
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:06:23
Because you bought with your bank account. That’s an ACH transfer, takes 2-5 days usually. Wait till it comes out of your bank account. If they don’t take it out of your bank, it’s a bounce. Saw this happen to someone else where their bank denied it.

Grab a Ledger S or a Trezor. Really makes a difference, you can take some worry off your shoulders. I really don't use any app wallets for this reason, regardless of how secure they claim to be. Sorry to hear.

Cool UI. Is this in production?
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:37:27
You're fine. Every time Coinbase does a transaction, they create a new address for you. This is for security. You don't need to always use the same address, you can create as many as you like.
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:23:46
I use a Ledger S. I sent some btc to my Bitcoin address on Kraken. My Ledger shows the correct balance, Kraken received the sent btc, but if I look up the transaction on blockchain ( the address I sent the coin from now says 0 BTC.
Looks like the balance of my wallet was sent to a second address. I don't quite understand. Is my Ledger balance correct, or is the blockchain balance correct?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:54:16
Feels good to own one full bitcoin. Buy one bitcoin and hodl. Bask in that and watch the market, you’ll surely know whether you want to put in the other 10k after some watching.

Again, it's a cool concept, I'm sure people will use it once you clean it up and secure it a bit more. Even if the users are in charge of transactions, the UI/UX of the site is a big factor in people trusting the site to not be phishing them in some way. In it's current form, all signs point to something phishy.

Thinking of last weeks dip down to $5500, some people likely panic sold coin at $7500 and rebought low. On the extreme off chance that last week it continued dropping down to $500 and my coins were stuck in my hardware wallet, unable to be sent, that's more my concern. Farfetched, but worse case scenario I suppose.
Saw a lot of people last week that had their coins locked up on the blockchain in transit to an exchange when they wanted to sell high.

Honestly it's just as straightforward as it can be made in my opinion. The service doesn't necessarily have to cater to the user 100%. Coinbase is sleek, attractive, uses trusting color schemes and really labels every single piece out for you. There's a learning curve, sure, but I'm not sure it can be anymore automated for a user without hurting them. Users need to learn these things if they're going to be expected to utilize these types of systems as soon as possible. Addresses, Fees, Keys, etc..
Have a look at BreadWallet, they're just a wallet right now, but you can buy Bitcoin through them, they're another great example of solid User Interface/User Experience.
Have you used Kraken? A good example of a polar opposite approach in all aspects.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:19:16
Also keep in mind, if a business accepts bitcoin, and then the price moons, they are more likely hodling that coin. Much better investment than transacting USD into your business account with no appreciation. For the small amount of people who will take that business up on their offer to accept bitcoin, it isn't going to kill them to hold onto the bitcoin they gained.
