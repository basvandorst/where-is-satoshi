I was going to use this method. Thanks for re-iterating. Good to let anyone else know who may read this

 I would use one I can remember. I'm not super worried about the the encryption. I seriously doubt anyone who finds it would have the wherewithal to know what to do with it even if they did find it. Also, I would know about it before they would have time to do anything with it since the people who have it would let me know it's been compromised since all of their stuff would have been compromised in that case as well.

 I would tell them to NOT plug it into anything(I trust them to listen) and to put it in a secure location where they would put their own financial storage location.

[JUST READ THIS]( for easy to understand and detailed instructions.**

Can you transfer your BTC back to GDAX immediately after the fork or do you have to hold the BTC in your wallet until you have verified you've received the BTG? Asking, because I trade and not a HODLER.

This analogy is helpful in regards to "what to do", so thanks for that!
But I still don't get how a hardware wallet gets cloned.

So.. I think I may have it now.
[This]( gives a reasonable overview of the process; which lead me to [this post]( from Coinomi soft-wallet that detailed how to get your BCH after the last fork.
After reading those posts I see process as such
1. Move coins from GDAX to Coinbase before fork
1. Put coins in Soft-wallet where you know the private keys(Coinomi, Exodus, etc...)  Not even sure if step 1 is necessary and you can start at step 2
     Q: **Do the walletts have to support the fork?**
1. Wait until "all clear" message from CB after fork
1. Each software wallet will then issue instructions on how to obtain new coins(not sure about hard wallets)
1. Move coins back to GDAX to resume trading
1. Profit!
Can somebody let me know if that's correct? If so, I will update my OP.

You don't quite get the ELi5 part do ya?

This is more an explanation of what is occurring and what it means as opposed to "what to do", but thanks for the info. It was a good red.

I apparently don't understand the process(hence the ELI5). How does moving coins OUT of an exchange get you the new forked coins?
A better way to put it: how do you wind up with the new forked coins?

[I think yes]( , but I'm not an expert.
