Nah they just shaked of some loosers and its going up again . Muhehe
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:18:13
Price atm is being manipulated ... There even more red candles in row than during major drop.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:37:32
My guess is 5500 and then big pump to like 6300 before the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:43:21
When they dont tweet about it or spread in on social media doesnt mean they dont buy it. I actually hate people around me showing how big dicks they have buying something expensive or posting this motivational bullshits on facebook walls about success lol. People that accumulated silently since begining are true winners.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:15:00
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:38:30
Nice find! Sell half and enjoy it with your family . Hold the second half as it may pay you the first one next year ;)
