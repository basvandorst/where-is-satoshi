Yeah, I checked after sending the transaction, that's where I saw the figures for less than 90 minutes usually. But I'll start checking before transactions to have best fee.

Thanks for the very detailed reply! I will use it next time I have to do a transaction. 
And yes, it ended going trough already :)

Ohh, so that's it! Thanks for the very helpful info. I'll just wait.

I'm confused, is that highlighting the risk? Or implying it is small?
@_date: 2016-05-02 22:04:39
This guy is good... Really good! Look at him go, one of the best liars I've ever seen. And check out those facial expresssions.. There isn't!!!

Reading his twiter.. he sounds so much more like a lamer than the mastermind manipulator I pictured him to be yesterday.
EDIT: ok, that account is as authentic as Craig. It makes sense now :)

I understand that in the future when all prices are btc it won't matter. But in the present, all you have could be halved (or worst) in a matter of days. You would have the same number of btc but you could only buy half of what you could a few days ago with those btc. Of course it is an unlikely and extreme example.
I think you answered the question implicitly by saying your ok with the risk, given it isn't even on your radar. You only care long term, if you go broke tomorrow it doesn't matter.

I don't belong to bitcoin comunity although I've followed the news on and off since before the 250$ all time top. Don't know much about what Gavin is up to (small/big block wtv) or his possible motivations. 
No bitcoin drama (or bubbles) so far have been as engaging to follow as this one. There may be so many things really going on.
One thing is certain to me, at the time of this video Gavin is 100% sure that Craig is not Satoshi. After the initial unpromted comments that he made at the conference I thought it was possible he didn't want to believe he had made a big mistake, and was trying to delude himself. After seeing the video, I know that this is not the case. He deliberately and carefully says the rhetoric we all hear, and of course he knows it is not the true. Some body language and phrase construction makes it quite apparent.
This is all I can add to the speculation. Would be great to hear about his possible motivations from those that know more about the situation surrounding.

Buy the media? Why do you think the media was bought? Isn't it perfectly reasonable to think they were bullshited?
When I see Craig's BBC video [1] he looks like to me like the psychopathic mastermind behind it all, no need to get complicated with government related conspiracy.

The timing of media making a mistake? Or the government wanting to reduce freedom? 
I would say the second is pretty constant throughout the year. And the first must happen much more often than 1 time per year. So no, not weird at all!

Sir, may I ask if we are in the presence of a conspiracy theorist?

What happens if btc looses 50% value in one week? You don't mind that risk?

If we follow your way of thinking, he could also easily be an alien with alien intentions.

Makes sense.
