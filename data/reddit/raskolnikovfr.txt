@_date: 2018-01-22 18:33:00
Crypto is boring now. It looks like term deposit . Boring
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:57:20
Love it and blocked everything on the list
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:39:09
That's normal more users more money BUYING.
But be smart BUY everything people is selling...
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:39:56
No, you won't. I bought the ATH at €2400 and everyone told me you're stupid.
Here we are :-)
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:47:11
ETH 469 is a joke. It will be more lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:32:15
Bought 10k at 18,300. Understand your pain ��
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:21:13
Just btc? When are you going to cash out?
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:31:15
Cheers for those who called me crazy!

@_date: 2017-12-22 21:43:05

Just have fucking balls. 30k is coming ! RemindMe in 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:16:10
Ow congrats!
I've started investing by August 2017 and I already have this portfolio, what do you think?
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:16:31
I cashed out all my savings and bought BTC
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:27:35
Where do you have your investment?
You can import from any exchange or do manually
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:40:22
401k isn't an investment ������
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:26:43
Can you take the money from your 401k and buy BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:22:32
Since when chrome is discontinuing the apps?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:53:26
BTC will reach 100k in 2018, why are you putting if before some stupid numbers��
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:11:43
Some updates regarding this 
I have borrowed 15 and then more 15 from the banks
Results : it's Worth almost 100k today with a 56000 profit.
I am thinking about borrowing more 10 but because it's a very green market I don't know which crypto to buy.
More details
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:20:25
Your coins aren't and will never be stuck on the ledger because they're in the blockchain, the ledger only allows you to "see" them.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:17:56
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:13:34
Wait, you sold someone that makes you richer every day for a car ? ������ 
Are you American?��
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:45:35
Not true. They can, and they have been mining.
For.more information contact this guy from Venezuela
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:10:27
No. I just want to believe.
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:45:07
10% is good. I put all my savings on it (15 000€)
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:15:13
How much?
Ask your mom, friends but DON'T SELL it. Don't.
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:15:51
Because... ?
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:48:44
I don't want to give money to the banks thank you
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:26:37
Good idea
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:25:28
Don't buy it. Too high
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:51:48
Buy and HODL!!
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:38:33
Why crazy? Personal loan here will cost me 13% per year. Bitcoin will worth more than twice in 12 months..m
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:22:44
Nopes. You should just read what the investors said months ago their prediction and what they say know.
Have a look at this article from May. We're in August and 3700$...
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:54:54
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:02:07
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:30:24
45% in my case
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:13:15
Don't sell it.
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:55:13
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:28:42
Hard to do the math here  but when I seen BTC growth + 521% per year I think it's incredible easy to believe that this kind investment is worth?!
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:53:24
1) I can afford this risk
2) it will grow. 
Specialists estimated in May that it will take 8 months to reach the $4000 mark. We are in August ( 5 months) and the price is 3714.....
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:06:46
Just buy, buy buy every �� available after yours bills
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:16:14
Is it a smart shot?
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:15:16
People say I'm crazy because I invested 15k but I wanted to get a loan and invest 40��
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:36:39
I said six months because after that I will have less money to invest.
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:49:52
Ow... Now I understand why we see so many philipins overseas
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:54:55
But every month. Stop nightclubs, Starbucks and cook your own food. Buy BTC. Come back here in December and thank me.
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:01:30
The problem with weekly buys is now the BTC is growing. I haven't seen that before. I bought my first one at 2400 now 3600. Imagine in one month
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:57:05
I gotta 2.15 and I'll buy another one next week. Just hold in 5 years you'll have 10x. Keep investing
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:01:20
No. They're already rich lol
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:14:50
Why did you stop?
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:02:21
Why 521% according to you
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:50:55
Haha I live in NZ so yes :D 
Sorry guys, Bitcoin won't reach $4500 today.
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:10:00
Fuck I bought 1 btc 1 week ago lol
I have €500. Should I buy?
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:59:59
I don't expect to sell. I do believe that BTC will reach the �� soon : 10k before 2019!!
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:37:05
I understand your excitement. I got 2.15 and I'm about to buy 1.2 today. Just do it!!
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:35:26
So sell it then but you'll regret
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:46:18
Why not? BTC is growing 10% week
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:10:01
Sorry 10 000%
Sell when you'll have 2 millions..
My strategy is buying dollar cost averaging approach. Keep buying, don't sell it and wait.
If what you have worth 2 or more millions sell it. You won't need more money than that.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:41:15
You will. Spend less.
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:05:25
Don't sell it until you have 1000% return. Don't sell it. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:37:00
Man yesterday I had 6694. I went to sleep, I woke up with 7009€
What else?
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:19:11
Stoping isn't diversifing...
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:50:23
Now I understand why we see so many philipins overseas
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:26:24
I hope your wife don't keep any other secrets from you loool
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:11:14
That's selfish.
@_date: 2017-08-12 05:59:32
And pay you interests to the banks NO THANK YOU
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:18:20
I'm a believer. 5000$ by October
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:32:39
You can. Just stop drinking, smoking and start flatmating for six months.
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:53:37
342. I'll be back in 7 days. You'll have 500. Deal?
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:40:28
Saturday and no 4500��
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:56:38
Unfortunately no, I came too late. If I want to get the million the price should raise until 200k per Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:14:39
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:16:41
Agree but we all know that it will increase. $5000 before December
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:17:19
Poor. Trying to get there... 
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:52:05
I'm. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:19:17
Your mom can't help you?
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:40:34
I think I'm gonna change my mind lol  the loan rate here is 13.30% per year...
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:03:28
Sell your car and buy now
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:21:14
Yep. It was just a predictin :
By December I will have invested : USD 12 500. I'm just wondering how could it be my return.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:16:54
The world isn't United States of America, did you know that?����
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:58:19
Fantastic! I am someone who's against mortgage and debts ( a true cancer). I'm more than happy to congratulate you for this fantastic decision.
How did you discover Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:00:08
Here we go :
I borrowed 30k bought 10 BTC
Today I have $74000, profit : $44k.
Probably borrowing more 15k soon and wait for the dip
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:59:07
HODL to 1 million
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:26:12
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:35:39
Bought. Already have twice.
If you guys hesitate to do the same, just do it. Forget your mortgage, buy BTC
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:57:36
Yes and no. It's the way they use their taxes.  Hospital and studies are supposed to be free and no one complains about that but as soon we say oh let's ban the firearm,guns, you will see thousands on the streets...
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:36:57
Army ������
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:30:22
No.  Don't sell BTC
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:51:50
I have the same question. November has been one of bullish month ever.  No dip for the moment :'(
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:30:44
Buy LTC or monero
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:54:34
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:46:21
Taxes paid me my graduation and my 2 masters and today I'm making 90k and paying taxes which help other poor students as I was 10 years ago. Nothing is free but American system is fucked. Everyone is born with a painful and heavy duty : pay the banks.
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:10:45
Spread around to buy a 8k ��? ����
Basically you're not working anymore, are you?
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:26:20
Americans lol your system kill you. University is supposed to be free, hospital free and the government is supposed to pay you when you don't have money while studying. 
The majority of people here are Americans and they all say the same : I want to pay my debts. It shows how bad the American system is. People is rich of debt.
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:07:06
I hope you didn't cash out. By 2021 1 BTC = 100 000. What do you say?
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:23:21
Too sad. You should wait until the 2021 when we go to the moon 200k per Bitcoin. Your lack of ambition is disappointing
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:37:24
Soon Kakaroto
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:00:14
Probably 10 so you can have 1 million in 2 years when it will worth 100 000 each.
I have 4 and I'm crying because no more dips
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:50:34
I am not advocating for taxes but for Free studies lol
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:19:39
2500-3500 in few weeks. Just wait
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:20:29
I don't remember this episode
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:17:41
Why wasting your time with real estate, taxes etc if you can do better with crypto?
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:09:24
More than that now lol
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:04:45
! RemindMe 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:53:23
40 or 40 000 Bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:00:20
Vegeta, please miserable human, don't insult our Prince.
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:30:15
Fuck! :'( 
I invested $15k and now I have 32k . I want to buy more but this ducking dip isn't coming ��
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:09:24
Idiot you said ������
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:28:22
So if I understand well, you should never never ever sell your BTC . 36 btc today wroth more than 137k ����
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:51:07
Which dip? The true dip is 3500-4000 ��
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:39:01
I bought 4 Bitcoin when it was 4000 and everyone said wait for the dip ����
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:58:20
Haha this post 1 month ago lol
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:34:17
We ser alll happy and waiting for Vegeta meme
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:20:25
7k? When
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:21:08
Seriously? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:11:08
Who's still buying BTC? I miss the dip
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:41:13
You're right. Do you mind in sharing your portfolio? Do you have only BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:45:56
Never sell Bitcoin.
Buy the dip, wait, buy the dip, wait. REPEAT
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:44:36
Same here. The question is are you going to keep buying?
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:33:52
If $5500 is a dip Yes. But $7700 is cheap for 10-14k in few months
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:21:27
Send to your cold wallet as soon you see a drop and keep with you. COINBASE became a big bank online and what do we all want to with banks? ROB. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:51:27
Yes it is I bought when it was 3000.
Wait for the fork and take all your savings and buy BTC. Thank me later
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:46:41
He should haven't SOLD. HOOOOODL
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:22:19
Which app?
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:39:28
My salary
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:29:32
Based on what?!
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:34:50
How much?
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:13:28
BTC isn't on sale. Wait for the dip and buy thousands of dollars or keep buying every week
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:47:37
lol you forgot one '3' or '4' before your 439.73
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:36:59
Thank you guys for all comments.
1) I haven't bought anything yet. It's too high and I already invested $13000 and bought really high. I barely have 4 BTC
2) I will wait until November or if it "crashes" at 3600 level again
3) wish me luck. Either I will be writing a post as how I earned 100k in 12 month or how I lost everything
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:02:18
Hi everyone,
The loan is 13% per year. In 1 year with the Bitcoin I will have twice in six months. Just check the news, the banks are starting the adoption, people is buying. BTC is safe
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:35:28
I'm praying all gods and devils .. this dip must be there until Friday ( when I get paid) haha
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:41:17
3k is really really far away. Believe it will go at 3.7k and then 10k in 2018
RemindMe! in 6 months
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:55:33
I think trading would be VERY dangerous but buying and holding east...
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:14:10
Shit dip. Waiting for 3700 level
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:53:53
That's what I've done until now. :)
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:08:28
Who told you I wanna buy a house?
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:57:33
Buy a car
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:33:25
I buy more!
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:42:10
RemindMe! 1 year
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:08:16
Indeed. I do know that BTC AREN'T an asset but I also know that more and more people will be buying it in the next 12 months which will have consequences on its value.
If Bitcoin worth NOTHING in 2 months, I will still be able to pay back the bank with my salary.
I'm borrowing 30% of my annual revenue per year and to pay back in 2 years with a very low rate.
2 scenari :
1) I buy and hold 
2) I buy and sold 30k to pay the bank
P.S: I think Bitcoin will reach $6800-6900 level soon before to crash (Fiobbanaci) $3500 and finally the moon $14 000.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:53:58
See you in 9 months.
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:23:40
Not really. Bitcoin will be there in 12 months.. those tokens who knows...
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:57:15
Thank you so.much your for analysis and opinion. VERY helpful.
I'm not buying anything for the moment because u know that a correction is coming.
I believe (Faith) that the price will crash in November maybe crashes (2600) and people will panic and at this moment I will buy 20k and then pray lol
ETH and LTC yes
Neo: I'm not sure how they're going to manage the Chinese law
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:47:32
DO NOT BUY PLEASE.
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:23:40
Not really. Bitcoin will be there in 12 months.. those tokens who knows...
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:43:00
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:37:00
Bitcoin will worth 100k in few years just read the news, analyse the market. It's happening
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:23:40
Not really. Bitcoin will be there in 12 months.. those tokens who knows...
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:55:47
Haha already put $15000 on it.. next step is 30
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:03:06
How much do you have today?
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:38:51
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:11:09
100k by December. Mark my words. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:50:59
I will keep paying the loan to the bank. There's one thing I forgot to say that I can pay this loan in 12 months with my salary so if I lose I will be able to afford that BUT if the BTC go to the Moon...
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:23:28
I have 4 BTC in my wallet, what's the best way to sell and buy later?
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:20:38
You should listen to him
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:21:14
Sell now and buy later for $4000 or less.
Thank me later
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:09:31
Indeed. Bitcoin will worth 14k by April 2018. HODL
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:41:28
+9000 Trump dollars.
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:02:54
You can do better than this:
Go to Europe
Start selling your Bitcoin in Euros then put the money in your bank account in the US.
0 taxes fuck IRS.
Some fees
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:36:54
Borrowing money from the bank.
And I need 10k to buy a car
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:52:22
Time to sell not to buy. Wait the correction in few hours
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:54:54
You can open an European bank account for free and keep your money or part of there.
Don't pay taxes in the US. You won't help anyone, just the army. Fuck the army and taxes
@_date: 2017-09-01 04:14:04
They were half right.. waiting for the crash?!
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:18:16
Just buy and hold. I'm about to buy 30k and will be holding until the 100 000 price
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:21:26
I'M NOT BUYING NOW. PROBABLY NOVEMBER.
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:22:21
But at 3600?
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:31:54
I didn't buy yet. Waiting for the dip... The true one maybe under $3600
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:42:33
How can I buy a car with BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:47:23
I'm not reasonable :-)
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:54:05
FIRST of all. Congrats you are my man. Go for it! Bitcoin will reach 14k by 2018. You can check a very good analysis here
