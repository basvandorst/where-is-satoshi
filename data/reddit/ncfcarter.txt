Yes deep dive to 8-9k first

i don't get the hate for Bitcoin, why is fiat so different, what is that backed by? Debt and that debt is only 10% in physical form all the rest is on computers and not actually there, fiat currencies are just are useless really

I remember that I was expecting a bounce of the 200ma for a new all time high back when it was 1800-2000, 800 being the daily 200ma

Agree, but 20k not yet, first we head lower over next few weeks towards 9k, Watch this space, I have 9-10k on January 9th and possibly lower before or after, however that dip needs to be bought into even if we drop into 6-8k range

I should of added IMO on that first comment to be fair

Hmm not so sure yet, central banks won't lose this battle, they will pull Bitcoin in regulate it into their favour or push other coins that work best for them, look at Ripple, every other coin showing weakness, this one is shining, banks like Ripple

Yea course it is, anything future based is a guess
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:25:46
Yes it is the true one, it's like a people revolts, eventually won't work IMO, banks will win, better tech will come, we are waiting for the Google and Amazon crypto to come through, maybe they're already here, im all for crypto and believe it's the future, just don't see Bitcoin being the top, may even be obsolete in the future

It's just an algorithm target, pretty accurate so far, 9.9k on January 9th, I  am selling into this high and will look for that number, I believe in Bitcoin, just not that it will go in a straight line, GL

Also the US government is the only thing that gives the dollar value, it is just a piece of paper and holds no instrinsic value, if the government suddenly turned round and gave no confidence in the dollar it would be worthless, also there's a limited amount of Bitcoin, it can't be printed oit and go into hyperinflation, but someone may need to correct me on that, he sounds way too salty, must be jealous of the longs

The capitulation of weak hands hasn't finished yet

Yh we will see, I was more using the term that Bitcoin is MySpace and we are waiting for the Amazon of the cryptos to come through rather than the company itself producing its own crypto, e.g Google wasn't the first search engine to come out but is now the biggest, Bitcoin is the first crypto but IMO won't be the biggest in the future

Excellent and very good idea, get out of Bitcoin and get into better alts, would not touch Bitcoin here at all, actually have an average short from 14400, I am very worried for recent Bitcoin longs actually, expecting a massive dip soon IMO, better tech and alts are here, 2018 will be the year of the alts 
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:53:15
Bitcoin just lost major structure,hodlers should be worried 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:31:15
Yep Bitcoin is dead
