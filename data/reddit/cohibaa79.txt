Thanks for clearing that one up, even if very few bothered to read your reply and just downvoted you, lol.  :)

Their admins probably aren't stupid enough to be living in the USA while running these operations.
I'm sure they are greasing the necessary palms in the motherland, as is customary.

Nope.  If you try to fire this, you will likely damage your firing pin and/or other components.  But they are kinda cool.

What is the easiest and lease costly (no/low fees) way for a person in Argentina to exchange their currency for bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-08-19 02:43:37
This is one reason that renting on [LeaseRig.net]( is better than buying some mining contracts. You get direct control over your pools at any time.
@_date: 2014-11-05 03:35:53

Do you know how many of the stores or restaurants in that mall accept bitcoin payments?  Even if people just think it's a regular ATM and then don't use it, but become curious, it's cool.  That would suck for the owner though, so I'm hoping some research on the market was conducted, and this was deemed a best-location available, or close.
@_date: 2014-09-04 03:17:01
Don't forget, every exchange and similar service that may handle your coins in some fashion will also take their cut.  
Exchange USD to BTC... fee.  Exchange BTC to USD... fee.  Send a transaction in a timely fashion... fee.  Oh wait!  What?!?  You want to WITHDRAW your coins from our exchange to your own wallet, or some other service!?  That's gonna cost you...
