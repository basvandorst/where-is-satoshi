Except I can send Bitcoin anywhere in the world with my phone and there aren’t any mountains of it floating in space. Wait... isn’t the market cap of gold 7T?

I think Trump supporters may be capable of disagreeing with him on Bitcoin while agreeing with him on most other geopolitical matters.  JS.

I will disavow anybody who doesn't agree with me in lockstep 100% of the time... says the leftist.

I read plenty of books. I recommend The Black Swan by Nassim Taleb.

I can buy $1 of bitcoin on cashapp and it settles instantly. Not knocking Gold or REITs, but you're probably wrong.

If Bitcoin becomes the global reserve elections wont matter.

Unemployment is at an all time low and there can be legislation put in place to incentivize hiring human beings vs automation. I see what you mean but it’s just way to extreme for my taste.

If somebody can explain to me why $1000 of UBI to every adult American is better idea than erasing personal income tax, I will vote for Yang. And no, "because it will make bitcoin skyrocket" is not an answer, although I'm happy I have that hedged.

You make fair points. But to answer your question, simple, write off every dollar companies spend on payroll if there is an automation alternative. If you truly believe that companies would rather save a few bucks vs. giving people a purpose, then that is some dystopian shit right there. It’s possible this will happen 50-100 years from now, but it’s not a 2020 problem. Like I said, unemployment is at an all time low, but national debt is at an all time high. The idea that we should just start giving away money away that we don’t have is radical as hell.  What happens to the so called “cheaper products” when the USD is devalued to oblivion. I won’t matter how much free money you get, because the McDonalds dollar menu will become the 5 dollar menu. Inflation is only a good thing for those who own gold, real estate, and I guess bitcoin. For those who live paycheck to paycheck, this would only exacerbate their problems in the long run. Which is why I say, just reduce income tax. Boom. Mission accomplished with no bureaucracy behind it.   
For the record, I’d take Yang over any of the other crack pots in the Democratic Party, at lease it seems like he’s genuine.  He is in outsider and it’s obvious. But that doesn’t make his ideas good.
Repeat: unemployment is at an all time low.

1 word, Super-Delegates.  Most people don't know this. It's such a stupid system.
