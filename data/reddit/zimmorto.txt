The only reason is they don't know about bitcoin. You know about bitcoin. Time will come they know that too. When that time arrives we may try to understand better than bitcoin, who knows?

I have added 3 more lines to the above code. Check it if it works or note. You need to install bitcore-message module to use it with node hope you know that already. I indicated the three lines with **  for your reference. While executing remove **s from both ends. Good luck.
    var bitcore = require('bitcore');
    var explorers = require('bitcore-explorers');
    var insight = new explorers.Insight();
    **var Message = require('bitcore-message');**
    
    var vaultAdd = '';
    var wif = ['', '', ''];
    var address = {};
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; wif.length; i++) {
        address[bitcore.PrivateKey.fromWIF(wif[i]).toAddress()] = i;
    }
    var minerFee = 10000;
    var k = 0;
    
    function myLoop() {
        setTimeout(function () {
        insight.getUnspentUtxos(bitcore.PrivateKey.fromWIF(wif[k]).toAddress(), function (error, utxos) {
            console.log('utxos' + ' :' + JSON.stringify(utxos, undefined, 2));
            if (error) {
            console.log('Error in getUnspentUtxos: ' + error);
            } else {
            for (var i = 0; i &lt; utxos.length; i++) {
                if (bitcore.Unit.fromBTC(utxos[i].toObject().amount).toSatoshis() - minerFee &gt; minerFee) {//ignore small balances
                var transaction = new bitcore.Transaction()
                    .from(utxos[i])
                    .to(vaultAdd, bitcore.Unit.fromBTC(utxos[i].toObject().amount).toSatoshis() - minerFee)
                    .sign(bitcore.PrivateKey.fromWIF(wif[address[utxos[i].toObject().address]]));//using global var to locate wif since k is not passed into here
                	**var message = new Message('This is an example of a signed message.');**
    				**var signature = message.sign(bitcore.PrivateKey.fromWIF(wif[address[utxos[i].toObject().address]]));**
    			console.log('transaction_hex: ' + transaction.checkedSerialize());
                insight.broadcast(transaction, function (error, body) {//this should be in a q to prevent spamming api
                    if (error) {
                    console.log('Error in broadcast: ' + error);
                    } else {
                    console.log(body);
                    }
                });
                }
            }
            }
        });
        k++;
        if (k &lt; wif.length) {
            myLoop();
        }
        }, 5000);//delay to prevent spamming api
    }
    
    myLoop();

Downloading now. I think it's been 8 months since any new development/changes to the software.
Edit: I just sent you my address. It says work is queued.
