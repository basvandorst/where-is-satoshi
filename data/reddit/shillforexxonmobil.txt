I think these people are just now discovering the value of the Federal Reserve and central banking

Lol that's exactly part of why he left, the instability of it all
And lol guess he was right after all

The gold standard is why the world economy was so fucked until the Bretton Woods collapse.
And lol good luck trying trying to buy a burger with gold. You will find many more merchants in the world willing to take USD, the de facto trade currency than gold.
There's a reason why we gradually switched from literal gold currency to currency backed by gold to fiat currency. C

I don't think you realize what banks do.
You need a way to shift money around, and banks are the most efficient way of doing that. The money sitting in your bank is loaned out to firms to buy capital. Without banks we would have far less capital investment or advances in technology.
It's like having an accountant. Yeah it costs money you could have used on operating costs and cuts into profits and productivity, but overall it helps you manage sales/inventory/taxes and leads to an increase in productivity and profit.

The exact same concept applies to Bitcoin, it’s just more arbitrary and random.
@_date: 2019-03-22 13:04:08
At has not the point. Just like 1BTC = 1BTC, 1USD = 1USD at all times. However, the value of both are not constant. USD goes through constant inflation while BTC arbitrarily goes up or down. 
1BTC in 2010 will not buy you the same
things or have the same value as 1BTC in 2019.

What is a limited liability corporation?

Crypto =/= stocks. Stocks, at least safe, established ones as a rule consistently rise in value. Crypto clearly does not.

Lmao it's clearly fake, there is no say a real thesis would use a survey like this with self selection bias, an inherently biased population since this is a bitcoin subreddit, no way to verify against multiple voting, etc.

Theres periods where that is true, and often long stretches (that 3 year stretch with no rise in price) with no growth at all. Then you have periods where it loses 65% of its value like now. When you buy low risk stocks, it's pretty much guaranteed to have positive ROI in 10 years. Bitcoin might be worth less than &amp; 1,000 in 10 years.

can't tell if trolling or retarded

Lmao only on would you find retards stocking up on a currency that has a fixed exchange rate.

Holy shit people are actually taking out loans to buy Bitcoins? I thought that was a joke/meme

Tf do you think economics is? 
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:46:38
I'm sorry but what he's saying is 100% correct and honestly quite obvious/common sense and backed up by economic data. It's something a high school sophomore just out of AP Econ would understand.
