what platforms are supported by memtest, and who makes this?

Absolutely yes it is built into training.  From the first weeks in police academy, police are taught how to gain the confidence of suspects, their family, and their friends, by lieing, downplayign the significance of the encounter, etc etc.  This is called "Interviewing" and is as much lying and bluffing as it is investigation. LEO's are taught to use EVERYTHING against whoever is the guilty party.  Remember, it is perfectly legal for the police to lie and say they have evidence that would implicate your husband.  But it is illegal (making a false statement) to lie to the police.  Even if you didn't think you were under oath or were officially being interviewed / interrogated.
The incidental utterance of a wife about a husband is ABSOLUTELY going to be used against the husband if he did something, anything, that is being investigated.
Hearsay (someone saying what someone else said to them) is not admitted in court, but how LEO gets around this is that the officer's impressions and feelings about how the person is behaving ARE admissible.  And because juries are purposefully kept to the most ignorant and impressionable people possible, they get away with it.  
This purposeful choice of ignorant / uninformed jurors is so that the defense / prosecution can mold their feelings / impressions of the jury without pesky things like common sense and knowledge getting in the way of the lawyer's goals (conviction / acquittal depending on the side).

former LEO here...
it IS an act to downplay the seriousness of what they CAN do and to get you to feel like they are on your side.
  "I'm just doing my job.  it is bullshit that we have to come talk to you, but when did you stop beating your wife?" (voice recorder going to record every incriminating or potentially damaging but not incriminating utterance.

I don't think the good college try is something that could be touted as the security model for what we hope to be the world's decentralized non-fiat currency.
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:52:02
hummm, may be the problem is my perception of a college try (does that involve beer??) vs other's perception fo a college try.  :-)

this is more what I was getting at.  If my mother in law can't figure out how to safely store her bitcoins, and have some of them available via a mobile device, but not have the coins tied to ONLY her mobile .... then it won't be hitting most of the people in the world.  those darn mobile phones get lost and destroyed remarkably easily

have you worked with people over 50yrs old and technology?  Nothing is a piece of cake for them, except their tasty bunt cakes.

sorry for the ambiguity.  I was referring to the the smears against running bitcoin on a windows desktop 
@_date: 2015-07-20 21:36:14
which is why bitcoin won't go anywhere mainstream.

Yay modern progressivism.

no it is only censorship when someone can prove that posts were deleted, users banned, and topics closed.

woot!  now what is the alt code sequence I need to memorize in order to type this? (when the new unicode charset is released and when my OS gets a patch to support it)
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:04:58
soooo you want bitcoin to die a quick death then?
