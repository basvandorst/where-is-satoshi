[IT'S BITCOIN CASH AND I'M NOT INTERESTED IN BEING INSULTED!](

That's a scary thought but a very real possibility. I think I may need to revamp my security posture. You never think it's going to be you until it is.
I'm still curious about that address. It's only 24 characters and, if I'm not mistaken, a BCH wallet is 34. Makes me wonder if GDAX runs any type of input validation if it is the case that I was compromised. It would seem that they do not. That or it was the other possibility ie glitch on their end

That's reassuring. Hope it works out. Thank you!

Yeah, wished I would have kept them on there. At the time, gdax was $3099 and other exchanges we're at $3500 so it seemed the logical move. Well so much for that. No, I get to go through the Coinbase support experience which I hear so many wonderful things about.

I have an enhanced account but not seeing instructions to sign up for the slack. I did find [this]( which was less than helpful. Any advice?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:28:15
Thanks for the help! Yeah, that is kind of steep. Do you know if we have any reason to anticipate this going down anytime soon?

Trying to figure out who I contact to get invited.

How can you tell it is in the same wallet? Thank you!

Just noticed update  Sorry to hear that. I'm also dealing with their support to a separate issue with them and your situation doesn't give me the warm and fuzzies. Hope it works out soon.

Just seen that. What do you think are the implications (mainly concerned with price action)?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:57:43
I'm still confused about the crypto to crypto taxable gains.
So, when I trade a crypto and hold it. My government wants part of that in USD?
Let's say after I pay the tax man the value of crypto takes a nose dive. So, I get taxed in USD and now I am at a loss as well. The amount I was taxed could theoretically be more than the value of my altcoin at this point.
Seems to me the logical answer is, if the government wants to tax crypto, they need to receive payment in that same crypto. They ought to be subject to the same volatility as we are if they want a piece of it.
Something about this thing seems real ominous if I an understanding correctly.

Right, I fully acknowledge cashing out being taxable but have been coming accross mixed info on altcoin trading. Thanks for the clarification.

Lol funny. I had created this [image]( about 4 days ago where I made the limbo reference with the bar being set at $4000. The one in the gif is set much lower and looking to be where it's heading. Holding!
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:22:24
Hopefully, this is also the case with other exchanges. I think if such a thing is pursued it could very well go up to the highest court. Thanks for the additional insight. So, I don't have to worry about for each and every altcoin I trade. It's mostly focused on cashing out and the purchase of goods for instance. Correct me if I'm wrong please.

Thank you. I hope the Sia devs fork the shit out of those overproduced miners. Sometimes the politically correct choice isn't the best choice.
