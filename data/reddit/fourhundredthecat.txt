If you don't care, why do you feel the need to tell us ?
The price drop seems to be bothering you

It makes huge difference. You seem to neglect the fact, that many people bought in when it went to 20k

Banning crypto is the least of their problems. 
They have food shortages, no medicines, no services, no nothing.

Bitcoin can still fail

to zero, eventually

why are you doing this ?
Are you intentionally trying to loose money ?

Look at it from the positive side. If the price drops below $1, then you can buy more than 6240 bitcoins for the money you did not lose.

May I ask what made you decide to buy at $4950 and not at ~ $3000 couple of weeks prior ?
I am genuinely interested why you did not think it was a good investment back then, but thought it was a good investment now.

A scam implies a master planner behind some fraudulent scheme, who tries to profit from it. Since nobody controls bitcoin, it's hard to claim it is a scam.
A bubble, on the other hand, only means excessive valuation, usually followed by crash.
Would you admit bitcoin was a bubble if it collapsed to $1 ?
