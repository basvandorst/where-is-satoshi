Kenyans have been trading Kenyan shillings for M-Pesa for a while now, so much that it's considered the dominant currency by many because it's the cheapest/easier/safest way to move funds. It's not hard to trade gold for Rupees in India. It's not too tough to swap Bangladeshi Taka for USD.
Mining is a non-issue because few of these people will be participating in that kind of activity. The developing world doesn't utilize personal computers or laptops; they use cell phones and SMS to communicate, and many of them are using phones to transfer funds right now without knowing bitcoin exists.


Please quote the part of my post where I said or even implied that bitcoin levels the currency playing field. Bitcoin *can* level the economic playing field by allowing public investment in developing economies. If you want to learn about this you can research distributed autonomous corporations.

I'm interested in hearing how this is "putting money where their mouth is" when the price of a security over the course of a year is indicative of nothing.
How about we bet that in 20 years BRK and Buffett will be utilizing technology which is in some way derived from this recent cryptocurrency experiment? Or how about we bet on whether or not technology derived from this cryptocurrency experiment will be utilized by developing nations within 20 years? Those are bets I'll take and they are a lot more indicative of the legitimacy of cryptocurrency than comparing one year spot prices.

As a current business owner I can state with 100% certainty that the legality of additional fees for credit card charges varies from state to state, but most states now allow you to charge extra for credit cards.
And that's a very good thing, because credit card companies and processors are huge scumbags who erode your profit margins with their ambiguous fee schedule. I paid almost 4% on about $85,000 of credit card transactions last year because of back-ending by processing companies even though the discount rate is advertised as 1.69%-3.2%. I'm set to receive compensation from a class-action suit filed against American Express on behalf of businesses who processed AMEX cards, got fucked by fees, and then told we couldn't charge to offset the cost.
I would accept Bitcoin if I could, but my customers are all retirees and not too many of them use it yet.

Yes. So are financial markets under the legacy banking system.


Absolutely. So is starting a business, getting a loan for a college degree, investing in a mutual fund, or buying a house.

It's a crude process right now. PC's were clunky and slow when they first came out. Email used to cost $30/hr and you had to pay for the service while *writing* the email -- and everyones email address was a long string of numbers. It was nerdy and many people thought it'd never reach mass adoption. How are the Internet and email looking today? These digital payment systems will improve with time too; be patient.
Print a paper wallet. Use a QR scanning app to scan the public address. Copy/paste and email it to yourself. Send a tiny amount of bitcoin to the address, look it up Blockchain.info or any other blockchain audit site, if you see the funds you sent that means it works and you're all set up. 
You can import the balance to an exchange like Coinbase. At this time you aren't able to import incrementally; you have to import the whole balance. Not so convenient, right? That's another thing that'll improve with time.
How much reading into Bitcoin security have you done thus far? If you really want to get into this stuff it'll benefit you greatly to learn about the various security methods available.
