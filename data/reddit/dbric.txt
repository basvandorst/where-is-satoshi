The people doing charge backs won't be using bitcoin. They'll be using their card. The one that lets them do a charge back.

You people are fucking pathetic. 
But, yeah, I do agree bitcoin is destined to fail. Limits to what it can actually do, a shitty community around it, overrun w scams, and huge PR problems as a result. Combine into that the fact that at some point in the future new coins will stop being created, this means eventually transaction costs will sky rocket. That will be the end of btc. In the long run, it simply has no staying power.

People who "invest" in oil are called something. What are they called? Oh yeah... Speculators. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:06:30
Stocks imply a legal obligation behind them, so no, they're not just basically speculation.

So when the discussion about art doesn't go the way you want, you switch the topic to software. Good job. 
The irony is that a bunch of people who produce nothing for bitcoin (for free) sit around telling others to produce things (for free), as if any large amount of people actually produce high quality products and expect nothing in return. 
Time is a resource. Equipment is a resource. Just because costs of reproduction of certain things are close to free does not mean there should be no compensation. Without guaranteeing compensation, innovation and creation severely slows down.

Whatever dude, smoke another j and tell me about all the great things you've made for other people for free. Link me to some content. If you can't, or won't, then I'm comfortable calling you a hypocrite. Edit: Furthermore, I'm still waiting on an explanation as to how YOU are being OPPRESSED by not being able to have everything made by anyone for free. Guess what, you want free shit? It's out there to take. Most of it sucks because in the real world, people don't make good stuff for free. How netflix is oppressing you, you still haven't explained. You're free to make art. You're free to make software. You're even free to make a shitty little subreddit where people share free stuff. But one day, if you ever make something really good and think you'd like compensation for the time, energy, and experience you put into it, you're not going to be able to, because "people should have free shit" is your business model. Good luck paying rent. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 20:13:54
No you can't. By nature of the words "prove" and "you" and "anonymous".
You can either prove anonymously that there are bitcoins in a location, or prove not anonymously that you own bitcoins in a location. You can't do both. It's physically not possible due to the nature of reality.

@_date: 2015-04-20 17:23:11
Well obviously since people pay more for it, they're willing to, since they want a higher quality product. They wouldn't pay for it if they didn't care. Edit: I also don't get how netflix is "oppressing" you by enforcing copyright on THEIR product. You wouldn't say best buy is oppressing you because you can't walk in and take a laptop off of their shelf and walk out without paying. You wouldn't say a dentist is oppressing you because he won't fill your cavities for a few cents. Operating businesses requires money to be exchanged. Period. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 16:58:44
Yeah, crowd funding isn't nearly as great for artists as it's cracked up to be. To take the netflix example, funding a project that ends in the quality of House of Cards would be impossible to pull off. You couldn't even get the camera equipment for the price of the proceeds of a crowd funding campaign.

You anonymous reddit account isn't anonymous unless every time you've been on it you've been connected through proxies, etc. In which case, you can only tie the reddit account to the address, not "you". You are not your reddit account.

@_date: 2015-04-20 02:34:53
Wow. So you're full of shit. 
Normal companies have legal responsibilities and publish reports. You can look these things up or request them. Also, large enough companies have shareholders and boards and departments that house information. 
As for the derivatives market, that's completely irrelevant to this company and you are just using it to create an environment of "don't ask questions, because see? These other people fucked up!"
Edit: also...


No. Fuck you. I don't want to work with stupid people like yourself. Or, and this is my suspicion by your use of exclamation points, you're probably just a scammer of some nature. And are you just another changetip sock puppet?

If you have an agenda, and all the time in the world to formulate your language, you're not going to make as simple an error as exposing your agenda through improper use of pronouns. This is the dumbest idea I have read in a long time. 
Somehow, the shills are smart enough to create a conspiracy against you, and can keep this a secret in every aspect of their activity, except they screw up the use of "I" and "we". Lol

In which case you could either 
1) Remove anonymity by revealing the actual person or persons behind the account, or
2) Keep anonymity but not prove that the user (not the account) owns the previously mentioned bitcoins.

You can't prove you own anything anonymously. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 23:27:41
Whatever, I'm interested in the fact that a community so committed to the idea of anonymity doesn't actually know what anonymity is. Or what ownership entails by definition. Reddit accounts don't own things. People own reddit accounts. Edit: I could "anonymously" "prove" I own "fiat" by taking a picture with today's date of a big stack of cash and posting it from this account. That would satisfy this discussion's distorted definitions. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 22:03:51
So YOU can't anonymously prove that YOU own anything.

You aren't "randomly" hitting the keyboard, no matter how much you think you are. You may be hitting it in a pseudo-random manner, but you are far less random than a good random number generator. You can disagree or watch all those crappy tutorials you are watching as much as you want, but you are very wrong. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 19:51:07
A random generator that creates truly random outputs (or close to it) is far safer than creating what you consider to be random output from your brain. Humans aren't very good at randomly creating anything. Numerous actual scientific studies verify this.

Well I don't think humans are purely deterministic, but there are patterns of behavior that can be pretty predictable thereby increasing the chance of his output being pseudorandom, making it more easily predictable than truly random systems.

I mean the ZLB stands for when the interest rate is at or very near zero. That's as far down as you can go without having a negative interest rate. I just mean the "usual" ZLB, poor wording really since it was ambiguous kinda. 
Although there [have been monetary policies that when at ZLB supposedly would have worked](
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:19:07
What? How do you think they target interest rates? ...by adjusting the money supply through open market purchases, etc.
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:58:16
No but your post implied that their activity didn't have the proper effect due to the current situation of depressed GDP w r t historical growth rates, when in fact the fed's activities are only one factor in GDP and have had as much effect as they can have. The rest is up to fiscal policy, and for whatever reason, lawmakers are failing to deliver. Combine this with reduced demand for new housing (demographics issue, see baby boomers) and that's why the situation is what it is.
Smart people study this stuff and have the answers, but lay people don't read academic papers, opting instead for YouTube videos to inform them (wrongly) on such matters. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:58:17
Assuming the only thing hindering GDP growth rates is interest rates? Ok. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:35:26
This would only be ok for an undergraduate Econ paper, and even then, the complete lack of 1) math, graphs, data, economic methodology, etc., and 2) academic sources pretty much means you'll get a solid D.
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:51:10
Dude there's still a ZLB affecting the regular stuff whether or not BTC's price is being pegged to a certain number of dollars lol
Edit: and then you also have a ZLB on BTC price
