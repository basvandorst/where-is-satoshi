Why wasn't your wallet encrypted?!

Woaaaahhh, Now the politicians are able to launder funds into their campaign via bitcoin. Good for value, bad for rep
@_date: 2014-10-15 14:40:58
Woah... I live in Victoria, no wonder we couldn't get a bitcoin ATM sooner, OUCH!, These guys are as bad as BFL

Huzzah!, Non-fractional reserve banking!
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:57:13
Oh THANKS Mark Karpeles.
You made an entire goverment avoid bitcoin by faking a hack a trying to run away with the remaning funds, yet you couldn't hide the coins from moving no matter the efforts, so you gave up but still won't admit what happened to everyones money
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:08:35
You could also send money across borders without the risk of it being seized, encrypt it and email the wallet.dat, once you gain control of the wallet, move all the coins off of it forever and erase that wallet.
You have just sent money via email across the world without scrutiny

I'm so glad that the "BTM" doesn't have all that Handprint garbage
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:44:06
This is Bullshit, Everyone should avoid and boycott this STUPID "bitcoin license" No way in hell should this be allowed, NOBODY using bitcoins should accept these requested terms, It's Compleatley unreasonable

Woah... I love the quality of the footage!

The scumbag clearly is Attacking Roger Ver, then once he gets attacked back, he claims "OH NOES IT WASN'T ME!, I WAS JUST A MAN IN THE MIDDLE!, I WAS COPY AND PASTING EVERYTHING!"
Total, Bullshit, and even if it wasn't Your aiding a criminal in criminal acts, that makes you a criminal, This guy should goto prison for this commited crime

Running a fullnode needs to let people gain TX fees as incentive to run a fullnode, I don't know about you guys, but i Only use bitcoin-QT, and it freaking Rapes my network connecting, Ping spikes all over the place, router cloggs and slows down, down/up rates crap out... Ugggh
I simply cannot run a bitcoin-QT node on my router without it Destroying my internets effectivness, Give us some limiting options and TX fees, you'll get ALOT more nodes popping up

Woah woah woah, Hang on... I've got literally 5300 albums of japanese music over a terabyte large, are you telling me that i can share this eHDD and earn btc from people listening to the music I shared?
Where do I start sharing as a Music Mover, and what kind of risks am I at for sharing a song I havent payed for myself?
*downloads song off google for free, shares it on bittunes to earn money* Is there a problem with doing this?
EDIT: Found this info on their site
1st Principle: Only authorized bittunes songs can be traded on the bittunes network.
2nd Principle: Music to be traded must be uploaded by copyright holder or approved representative.
3rd Principle: Artists ‘Music Makers’ will get a fair royalty with the potential to make a good living, hopefully.
4th Principle: The Fans ‘Music Movers’ will also make money by uploading music to new buyers.
I feel that a 50/50 split or a 40/40/20 take is totally unfair, The guy who Made the music did 10x the work of the person sharing it
Should be more of an 90/10 then 80/10/10% for bitturnes

Penn&amp;Teller did a great episode about why GreenPeace was totally bullshit, the founder left the group because it was taken over by personal agendas that had nothing to do with the greenpeace movement, They even got hundreds of people including their old official spokesperson to sign a petition to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide, AKA H20, AKA WATER.
@_date: 2014-08-01 16:18:59
Woah!, The chinese were CLEARLY a major part of the bitcoin economy! We need to get them back!, Damn that Ban!
@_date: 2014-10-31 17:07:50
My gosh, imagine this, since they all (or majority it seems) have these cards, and nothing is scrutinized, wouldn't many of them simply put monthly payments or charges on the card since they never have to pay it? 
The taxpayers are having ALOT of money stolen from them, a DHS employee could probably live entirely off the card never spending a penny of his own money, Why spend money when you can just use the unscrutinized card? You never have to pay it off and it's always accepted, shit, throw your rent, rental car, entertainment, food and more on that card every month, Why not? You're DHS and YOU don't have to pay off the card
They shouldn't even have these cards!, I can't afford a starbucks coffee every week, and now I find out that the reason why is because I've been buying starbucks coffee for DHS without being told, thats practically theft!

If there has ever been a good enough reason to move your miners to the P2P network, it's pretty much now, before that hashrate says "screw this"

That's a really eerie coincidence 650k btc "lost" by mt.gox and ~650k was bought by two trade bots?
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:21:00
Wonderful!, Now we can stay at hotels with bitcoins! all we need now is for gas stations to accept bitcoin and we'll be able to roam the planet with bitcoins!
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:28:09
Could someone clarify how we can plug this hole?

@_date: 2014-06-22 22:16:31
So much information!, Anybody want to give me a Sum of Approx how many bitcoins have been Destroyed/Lost and unlikely to ever be seen again
@_date: 2014-08-14 17:29:00
Oh look, proof that Credit/Debt is a bad thing, this exchange basically gave itself a "run on the bank" by closing the accounts using "leverage" to place orders.
You can't back something with IOU's It will lead to a financial crash and everyone in the economy will be harmed, rather than just the people that foolishly spent the money.
@_date: 2014-10-07 14:36:16
I hope people only use Circle as a hotwallet :S a major point of bitcoin is to be your own bank
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:40:57
HAH!, More "leverage weighted trades" getting closed!, THIS IS WHY YOU CANNOT USE A CREDIT SYSTEM, You will eventually Force a run on the bank!
I really do hope people realise that the reason this crash happened, is because BTC-E was allowing people to bid on more btc than they had the money to pay for, and viseversa, These "leveraged" trades were being force closed due to when people went to Buy or Sell, there was literally no money or bitcoin to recieve or sell, It was basically a style of Fractional Reserve Banking
@_date: 2014-10-31 15:30:03
Fractional Reserve Banking people!, The cause of all the insolvable Debt problems is the greed of a few fuckers early on who wouldn't stop abusing the system by creating FRB
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:06:48
Heavily agree!
@_date: 2014-07-25 03:48:05
What I hate is how much it slugs and "whores out" my router, pings in games shoot upto 999 and my miners even disconnect!, Let us set bandwith limits and give us TX fee rewards for having a bitcoin node open and running

Oh wow. This reporter did an Amazing job! I hope she knows that!

It seems like a pyramid scheme to me, especially the factor that the maximum supply increases by 1% a year and there is a 5% premine atop the fact that it's centralised and the only way to obtain is seems to be by promoting it
@_date: 2014-10-01 17:39:17
Because I can slowly generate funds that are not vulnerable to goverment inflation debts or collapse, it also allows me to make alot of different online purchases that I couldn't make before, because I refuse to own a Credit Card

people need to stop using ghash.io!
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:06:13
If we could collet block TX fees from running a full node im sure MANY people would turn nodes on, Right now theres just no reason to be a full node, Im only doing it because it was the first wallet system i used and i still havent switched because i see no reason to
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:18:06
UGGGGGGGGGGGGH What were they sold/won at?!
@_date: 2014-08-10 16:57:45
You can expect to be constantly looking at the charts to see if you're losing money or gaining value, You should make offline backups of the wallet and make sure its encrypted
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:18:36
To the m000000n!

See now thats a funny little loophole, they are allowed to reject high demonination bills, because you must legally be able to provide proper change, if you cannot, then you cannot accept the transaction.
Therefore, they claim to be unable to start the unlawful transaction, because they (are lying or actually can't) can't give you the proper change, thus, can reject the high denomination bills, because it would be illicit for them to accept them without giving proper change
It makes me wonder though, is it legal to not accept the Pound if it's your area's default currency?
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:02:25
Do you know that it was Actually coordinated?

It seems like not everyone can use NETELLER, For instance, as a Canadian, NETELLER wasn't a listed option for funding, so I swapped to Hong Kong... Still not there... So I changed to Japan, and Oh THERES the neteller option....
I'll wait for pokerstars to Properly accept bitcoins, I'm not going btc to fiat to chips to fiat in neteller account 
If you are Canadian or "International", neteller doesn't have Bitcoin listed as an accepted method
@_date: 2015-03-31 19:06:06
Really? 200? That should help me go a distance when tipping people who've never heard of bitcoins
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:44:23
Heres a question that I always get asked and can never give a right anwser to:
Can a person earn bitcoins (like... the transaction fees?) by being a Full-node (running the bitcoin-core) passing along transactions and confirming them?
My standard answer is "No, transaction fees are put into the blocks for the miners to earn" to which they respond "Why?! they already get 25btc a block!"
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:19:27
This was a very informative post, could you elaborate further? 50 bits @_date: 2015-03-27 13:24:07
It's apple wallet using meme creators that don't know of bitcoin
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:39:21
Perhaps people learned that there is a service that will pay you for running a bitcoin node?
I read about the incentives program, turned my node on and am still trying to figure out how to tie an address to it, perhaps there are a bunch of people who have done the same thing
@_date: 2015-02-01 15:16:48




@_date: 2015-03-24 22:52:58
Too bad people can't earn/collect Transaction Fees for broadcasting/verifying transactions, if they did we would see a massive increase in full nodes.
But sadly, how do you stop someOne from running a thousand or so instances and gaining all the tx fees and centralising the network :( I suppose thats why the fees are handed to the miners who break the block
