Bitcorn's point that Bitcoin operates more like a commodity than a currency is still applicable today.  I wonder if his stance on the value of Bitcoin, as a commodity, has changed in the last 3 years.

It is more likely that Bitcoin is soaring because Chinese exchanges are beginning to allow withdrawals for AML compliant customers.

The traded volumes are off-chain transactions, meaning they only happen intra-exchange and not on the Blockchain.

It's not about how you can use Bitcoin like money... It's about how money can't be used like Bitcoin.

Agree. A state that was an early adopter would have a big advantage, assuming the demand for Bitcoin would go up. Another advantage would be less overhead to manage. Vaults, physical currency and logistics would be dramatically reduced. In addition, a state could probably have better oversight on owed taxes. 
Loans made with a highly volatile asset like Bitcoin are possible, but they won't be as cheap as they are today.  These loans would have to be made with significant collateral in exchange. I could imagine a farmer offering tokens that equates to a share of the seasons crop or ownership in the farm. With a deflationary asset, loans also won't be as necessary.

Agree. Thank you for this.

Bitcoin does not have a governmental body, nor is it a corporation.

I see it a bit different.  Bitcoin does not reinvent money, but Triple Entry Accounting / Blockchain makes regulators and middlemen obsolete. 
I agree that the killer application for Bitcoin is store of value.
