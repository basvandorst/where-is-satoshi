And I thought Japan was super well developed and accessible to disabled people.

I don't think I agree here. The amount of computing power to roughly equate to how much the Bitcoin network possesses is simply enormous and no bank can possess such computing power. For example, if banks used their own version of bitcoin, it would be trivial for a hacker to do a double spend attack.

I think time and cost are issues because there are many banks. If there was one single bank, a distributed computing system could very well take care of all this fast and cheap.
Even if they used blockchain internally, they would have to interact with other banks and still work through awkward integrations. Are you saying all banks might want to form a united blockchain of sorts? In that case, I'd agree with the wins.


haha :)

thanks for the reply.
But I wasn't belittling Bitcoin or anything. Mine was a very technical question of scalability, cryptography, latencies, etc. I agree with your points :) but I wanted to start more of a computer science discussion :)
