Haha, yeah right.  I'll sauté my left testicle and eat a live zebra if *that* ever happens.

We need ROADS you heathen.

Now is not the time for dump.  That comes later.

Nope.  There's a secret formula for making road cement, and only the government has it.

It's approaching 16k now.  At this rate 20k before Sunday isn't out of the question.
Edit: also, "20k before Sunday" sounds like a pop punk band.

I'll track down Satoshi and eat his.

Not that I disagree with your core point, but they don't need a reason.  Sooner or later if bitcoin is getting too big they'll just slap it with all sorts of regulations citing environmental concerns, or maybe just make something up.

People are emotional, particularly about money, particularly when they're risking money, particularly if it's their first time risking money.  Lots of new money just found its way into the crypto ecosystem.  These people aren't battle-hardened investors and day traders, they're your friends and neighbors.  And a lot of them don't understand the tech; they just thought it would be easy money.  So that's my theory on who exactly is panicking and why.

Now that you've made it very clear you don't understand how bitcoin functions, I hope everyone will take your criticisms with a huge grain of salt.  
But you were right about one thing: don't invest what you can't afford to lose.

Good call on the terrorism thing.  I could definitely see them trying to, say, link bitcoin to ISIS.

Not the government!  Why, I never!

How will I put seven Lamborghinis in my Lamborghini account with only 5x returns?

I'm fully on board with declaring my ~1 million pesos in Resident Evil 4.

You got your BTC as a random gift from a friend and have no idea whatsoever about any of it.  It's as alien to you as it is to them.  
Should work unless you work in IT or something and they know it.

This guy looks exactly like one of my professors.  I'm going to have to ask him if they're related, I think.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:00:32
What difference, at this point, does it make?
