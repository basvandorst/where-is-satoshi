i would tip you, but that would be generous and lets just say this isnt the place for that ;)
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:49:27
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:25:21
im wrong.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:43:33
as soon as i come on here and talk about how im leaving i get tipped. haha i guess there are a few standup guys in here, thanks alot probably going to seans outpost or to some user who helps me out.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:53:05
I just said, im not active on the sub.. and you just brought up tips.
dont wanna fight but your just being a dick.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:37:58
no bitcoin wasnt actually the original but was superior to the others at the time, each coin is different and to call others worthless clones perpetuates this subs stereotype. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:06:41
i volunteer for space, so if this happens i call dibs.
@_date: 2014-01-21 18:59:07
Ouch. Can one not be many? I'm not comparing the two or trolling just trying to have a conversation.
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:02:56
there were many before BTC, but they were a funny one would be neopoints..lol. thats a CC.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:59:00
i wanna thank you for fighting my side for me by being a dick. isnt all BTC is, if you can find that logical.
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:38:40
im the douche? have you read his comment?
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:48:11
Again, not comparing the two. There are people  in both that are great people, I.e. tipping teenagers, or saving dogemas but its just my opinion and these comments below have helped me make up my mind.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:40:03
i dont need the money im doing fine i i wanted something to play with and bitcoin was fun, but i guess i just got tired of seeing the generosity fade away.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:18:31
Thats a great point, i will buy into BTC again in the future but it needs to stop being an investment and start being a currency.
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:11:40
the art of writing or solving codes-currency.
BTC was not the first one, the first decentralized one,yes.
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:34:55
im sorry for defending myself?
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:08:07
did i say clone? i said neopoints was a crypto i never said it was bitcoing before bitcoin. im just saying BTC didnt invent the crypto it just changed it drastically.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:15:07
I was curious if it was just me, or anybody else felt the change. not trying to come off as a dick or spam with to the moon. just want to have a Mature conversation.
Edit: Thats why im leaving, saying anything slightly negative and to downvote hell you go, real mature.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:56:38
its fun but i mean yours is yours and im not trying to persuade anybody to fallow me. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:41:22
your probably right, but maybe a new coin will come along.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:29:37
Exhibit A.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:56:10
No argument there.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:45:23
im not an active member of this sub anymore.
dont see your tips either, thats wierd.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:58:00
bitcoin was the first openly traded currency with a block chain and brought so much innovation and new tech with it but it is not the first online currency.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:58:14
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:42:20
I guess i wasnt investing for the money. but thats a solid point.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:53:59
yeah i dont really need the money im financially stable and bought in at single digits. im till playing around with 10 bucks in my mind.
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:25:05
i only bring that up when somebody calls me out on it.
@_date: 2014-01-21 18:56:15
Nice to see you pulled out the thesaurus for this one. I didn't come here to troll but have a conversation, that didn't go over well.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:38:55
Dont care what you think of me, you dont know me, i just want to talk but you guys make is personal. the fuck?
@_date: 2014-01-21 18:57:02
Be part of something that will change the world.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:29:16
you realize everything isnt a "bitcoin clone" right? just because its a crypto-currency doesnt mean it copied bitcoin. hell bitcoin is just a clone of another crypto.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:26:30
*hides in corner*
+11 doge
dont tell anybody im tipping though they might get mad...
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:40:29
this is a solid argument, and i commend your for that. i didnt come here to fight but thats what this post has turned into. ill probably come back to bitcoin but i fucking love cool runnings and used my 7 btc to donate.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:21:31
This isnt a subreddit for money dont kid yourself. This is a bunch of people who want to get in on a get rich scheme to late. as of now its an investors subreddit not a currency.
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:41:11
he called me an idiot, insulting my intelligence. So i said i have a college degree, yes.
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:10:33
but what did i say in the comment after. anything out of context sounds bad.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:55:53
not trying to troll, but have a conversation. Secondly im probably both older and more successful financially and academically than you are but you can insult everybody all you want you cant hide behind your insults forever.
so calling me an idiot is funny because you dont even know me.
EDIT: just looked at your comment history, you are an uneducated asshole. when you call everybody out on  education know your facts. if you are so smart, where did you go to college or where do you work?
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:46:10
Contest ends tonight, i will send al BTC tomorow
@_date: 2013-12-27 12:13:04
that question is not a good one. thats like saying what if everybody just stopped paying taxes? how do you want me to answer this i mean fuck pay your damn taxes.
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:54:26
why not just get it in dollars and convert, US exchanges are much safer. works but it sells cheap because its the only option.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:09:37
Get ready for a large order i love you work and i need to redecorate my office, and its awesome that your accepting BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-27 12:30:04
thats gonna be terrible..
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:32:12
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:33:03
So 90 tasks for a payout...ha
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:37:59
Yeah those zeros make a difference haha. exchanges are the best way to go with this big of a chunk but maybe in like chunks of 20? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:35:29
I am attempting to put on a sponsor charity run from bitcoin 
I.e. for every  bitcoin (May bump down lower depending on popularity.) i receive i will run a mile, for example if i get 20 bitcoin i will run 20 miles consecutively like a marathon. All proceeds will go to seans outpost, using my talent as a teen to help people.
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:16:44

Top 25 Private school in the nation, High class, some interested in bitcoin most dont know a thing.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:51:02
I can link you to any blockchain account if i want, you wont get anybody to gamble money without atleast a couple people to vouch for you.
@_date: 2013-12-27 12:01:43
It wasnt the legal stuff that got them shut down though.
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:12:13
This wesbite is not new, because nobody says "ill give you a bitcoin" anymore. they say "ill give you .01 btc"
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:41:41
Let me try to fix that, sorry guys
@_date: 2013-12-27 12:24:41
a 13 year old uni student..
@_date: 2013-12-27 12:19:29
ha open sourcing is replace education. how many 12 year olds are open sourcing right now?
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:19:36
That is not helpful..
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:05:24
i think it is just hard to start in high school because no highschooler can afford it. It would work alot better if somebody gave a highschool just one BTC to spread around and get people interested.
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:07:15
Another bitcoiner from hawaii! I sold off to early so i actually have none but i love the whole bitcoin movement and i wanna see it take off in hawaii!
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:01:27
I did it, and hers actually is good.
@_date: 2013-12-27 11:59:46
BREAKING NEWS: I just won Mvfresh of the year!

@_date: 2013-12-06 21:41:52
Well i mean...yea
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:27:04
Also from hawaii, we had sex ed in like 7th grade and then talked about heroin for a whole semester of 8th grade...
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:20:54
I wasnt gonna have the BTC in my account, i know that would worry people and that makes sense you could directly donate i was gonna talk to seans outpost in the morning to see if we could work something out.
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:01:35
The education system now is to monotone, its one education fits all. wether your are a genius or mentally challenged you will be taught the same way in public school. Thats why me and my kids attended a private prep school. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:29:33
im on on lion with a NVIDIA GeForce 320M. 
and im not completely new, im just lost..haha
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:37:43
So you want us to pay you before we have proof you can actually pay out?
@_date: 2013-12-27 12:06:29
Fuck see what your did now? Do you!!?
I cut myself that speech was so edgy.
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:44:09
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:32:42
1 btc pay out min.
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:30:16
if you have 150 million and you want to keep it safe during the transfer 250 grand is pretty minor . I find bitcoin better for cheaper trades like 10,000 vs 10,000 bitcoin would win every time.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:20:31
And I cant even get one.. haha ridiculous heist. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:02:38
eh you know if you wanna give me 5 bucks i can get you a really high quality scan of my qr code..haha
@_date: 2013-12-27 11:58:05
Hey dick, he wasnt saying it was. he was asking for somebody to explain it to him from a BTC point of view. Your the type of person that makes bitcoin unattractive. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:38:02
thats what i mean, you have to sell cheap.
@_date: 2013-12-27 12:04:32
You have to pay taxes on your returns..and if you are not then get ready for an audit. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:53:36
unless it collapses, then community college is the better option. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:53:48
tax free? lol
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:28:38
It happened to me and i just tipped it to people through out an hour or so. i ended up giving away about 5 BTC when it was at like  300 and i felt good about it just giving it in increments of .1, i recommend just passing your luck forward.
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:03:28
Well that kind of takes the fun out of it...
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:32:21
But at the same time the lottery is run by the government, your website is run by an anonymous reddit user. hwo do i or anybody else know your would ever payout?
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:31:46
nobody has that kind of money just laying around. thats about 1,200,000 dollars...try to sell it off in blocks of 100.
Edit: I dont know how to count.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:45:51
thanks alot and keep up the good work
