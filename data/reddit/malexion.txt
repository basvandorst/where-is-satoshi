I would assume you can save the private key or QR code and the use it to enable same authenticator in another phone.

This is fiction already, but I'm gonna throw it out anyway. Just to give some perspective of what I was thinking.
If we consider the maximum amount of BTC 21 million (although hundreds of thousands are already probably lost), then at current world population of ~7 bil, there are ~300k satoshis per person.
On the presumption that we can have BTC microtransactions in the distant future: If we parallel 1 satoshi with the smallest unit of modern currency, which is usually 1 cent, then the highest convenient value for bitcoin would be 100 satoshis = 1 USD (or € or something of similar magnitude).
This scenario would leave 3000 units of currency for each person on Earth today, which is really not that high number. Especially if we consider constantly decreasing bitcoin supply and potential population growth.
Let's say we colonize Mars or the Pacific ocean in the next 200 years. This could double the current population and so on...
**tl;dr** What I'm saying, is that 21 million BTC x 100 million satoshis might not be enough if BitCoin were to become the single Universal currency :)

More like, waited till you add some funds to your PayPal account and then freeze it indefinitely.

About a year ago, it took couple of days. Not sure how they're handling it now, with the massive influx of new users.

Indeed. Forgot about that option.

Not sure about the rest of the world, but in Europe, bitcoin-central.net gets you verified in half a day and SEPA transfer takes 2-3 days. 
Although they usually have 1-2 euros higher exchange rate.

Could you provide a source on that "30k transactions / hour with any PC" claim. :)

This strategy is easily nullified in casinos by having bet limits. So infinite money won't always help.

Waited for MtGox verification ~ 8 days and got rejected cause I had ID and proof of residence on the same picture. Now I got to wait another 10 days...
Registered on [Bitcoin-Central]( today and was verified 4 hours later.

Currently lost Bitcoins cannot be recovered unless the private key is discovered again.
But I've been thinking myself too...what if, lets say, after 100 years of no activity, Bitcoins from an address would be released back into circulation as miner's reward? What would be the downside of this?
