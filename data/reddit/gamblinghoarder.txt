Definitely great news that CoinSpot is accepting deposits again! I’m yet to be verified by them so haven’t bought anything yet but they look good because of their broad range of crypto on offer

I recently stumbled across “Crypto Investor” and “Ivan on Tech”.
Mike Maloney’s new crypto doco is good for some background into the tech. James Corbett’s Federal Reserve doco is interesting if you’ve ever asked yourself where money comes from

Got excited there when you mentioned Coinbase accepting AUD again... did you mean CoinSpot? Coinbase I thought was just credit card

New to Bitcoin. Definitely new to Reddit so apologies for doing anything dumb.
I bought yesterday on the dip. Nothing big, just $100 AUD with the intention of giving $20 each to my neices and nephews for Christmas (printed each a fancy colour A4 paper wallet in a plastic sleve with a flap protecting the pk from obligatory social media present haul photos).
Is transfering $20 to each wallet even worth it given the fees and the amount of time it could take to process? I was thinking of giving them the empty paper wallets (letting them know they're emply of course!) and if they really wanted to use the 0.001 BTC then I would just give them the greater of $20 or equivalent value. (They're only 10, 5, 4, 3 and 9 months so I doubt they're in a hurry to spend).
Typing this is giving me The Human Fund/Festivus flashbacks.
I gave them silver bullion coins a couple of years back thinking that would greatly appreciate. Spoiler alert - it didn't LOL. Hopefully BTC will be different!
