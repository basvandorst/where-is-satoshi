China is actually forging ahead with regulation and involving their power house companies like alibaba, tencent to get into it. Their president even comes out in public suppprt, state govt also opens a blockchain news website a week ago.
Ultimately the US has greater project funding, but little to no regulatory support. In saying that, wall street will probably force the issue politically as they see the potential and have the resources to do so.
Initially id say china due to the tech focus, however the power of wall street might push the $ power into US blockchain giants, eclipsing with size and money.

Going broke? As soon as a country starts relying on govt bonds just to turn on the lights it's far past that.

Let the crypto race begin, if putin sees a benefit you can bet other leaders are trying to see his angle. Ultimately he wants it to circumvent US currency order, expect china to move in step too

Except for the fact since 1983 the US govt started changing how cpi was calculated. Ever wondered why cpi is so low despite trillions in currency entering the market? If the same metrics pre 1983 were used cpi would be closer to 10% currently, fkn govts robbing us and our futures..

The whole point of crypto is to have untouchable funds governed by truly free market pricing/governance. There is 0 point in having 'crypto' stable coins that can be taken by a govt at a moments notice, regulated or not you may as well just use USD

Except us the people and devs will sound the alarm and wake us up to any bias or impending doom if core heads down that path? Which would cause an uprising/instability
