Why not just add a column where each new row places a hash in that column, the hash is a hash of the new row plus the previous rows hash columns hash.
If someone changes any row it would result in the hashes not matching. This could be done with Oracle for example and be a million times faster, it would be done over an encrypted protocol, nothing new really.

if the other party closes the channel you get your money back.

I recently bought a painting from Thailand (I was living there last year and first seen the painting then) I ordered it off the artist, we agreed on a price (around 250USD) she wanted western union transfer, the fee was like $40.
Western Union ended up not allowing me to signup because my bank account wasn't with the country I'm currently based in.
anyway I simply sent a bank payment, fees my end were around $10 but her thai bank ended up hitting her with a $40 fee lol.

They can't take your money, your money is still on your device, you're just signing regular bitcoin transactions, the nodes are the signing new transactions to the next person and so on, you can't lose your funds, sure a node could get hacked, but they don't hold your balance, you do.

but the average can come about by one person paying a super high fee, eg often when hackers have stolen hundreds of bitcoins they've paid a fee of over a single bitcoin, this is why average is pointless, also many transactions these days are batched transactions from exchanges containing thousands of outputs.  
Sure fees have been high but they're dropped a lot this week, but will never be as cheap as on the second layer like lightning etc.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:52:15

each transaction actually contains many more transactions, an exchange could do a transaction with 500 outputs, eg pay 500 people, but it shows as one large transaction, this actually takes up less space than 500 individual transactions, keeping fees lower and more space in blocks.

I think you misunderstand what a soft fork is, the soft fork ensures previous consensus rules apply, you don't need to have modified your node, it all still works as is, however if you wanted to use newer features it would make sense to upgrade your node, but as it's a soft fork, you can take your time doing it.

6 development teams? what is the point of this? Satoshi himself said there should only be one client, that is Satoshi's vision, but there is more than one Bitcoin client, my Bitcoin Core "Satoshi client" is currently connected for 5 clients that aren't the Bitcoin Core client.  
As for 6 development teams, mind linking to their up to date repos?  
And if they all have to follow the same consensus rule (which they do) why bother having 6 teams? why not have one team or 2 teams etc?  
Adam Back has bugger all control over bitcoin, stop drinking Rogers cool aid.

yes, you choose how much you want to fund it for, but it's best to leave it open with more funds, if you only want a single transaction ever to be done, then just do it on chain, but reality is you will probably want to use bitcoin more than once.

I then learnt of Bitcoin and thought it could work as a global store of value, I was also attracted to the name it reminded me of BitTorrent (another P2P network), because of this I always run a node.

What this clearly misses is people need money to buy Bitcoin, if people there already have money then they have the Euro which is much more stable and safer than Bitcoin.
I'm a big Bitcoin fan, but Bitcoin is an international currency  (and many other things) but it will never be a countries currency.
Let's say they dropped the euro tomorrow and decided to use bitcoin, how will the government pay for anything if it has no bitcoin? all those government employees?, how will the poor who get money off the government buy bitcoin?
I look forward to answers

Why?, Mining will be more profitable than ever, imagine a truely global scale cryptocurrency, the price would increase massively over time and the mining reward would be worth a lot, add to it the ability for miners to use a portion of the reward to fund channels and they'd have 2 income streams.

It would be quite cheap to start filling bcash node harddrives roughly 4gb a day almost 1.5tb in a year, most Bitcoin nodes are ran on spare (older smaller) harddrives, bcash though are in Chinese data centres, Jihan could foot the bill I guess.

@_date: 2018-05-29 00:47:24
Basically the daily Bitcoin inflation rate halves on that date, increasing supply by half and increasing demand, produces a hell of a squeeze
@_date: 2018-05-19 10:09:28
everything requires some moment of time to pass, even if it was instant, it would require the nodes to transfer double spends, and the attacker would need to magically be able to send a transaction faster than your transaction which had reached most the network before it reached the attacker.

Price is of no worry to me, stability is more important, as long as it doesn't jump more than 2% in a day either way I'd be happy, I'd be happy if it stayed at $300 for the next 2 years, but I'm like everyone, I got no idea which way it's going.
However, I do know the reason for the price going down, it's all the merchants using systems like bitpay to convert back to fiat, plus the 3600 new coins per day.
As the network grows, transactions increase, block reward halves etc, the volatility will become less

Cash for the internet, with no central authority, just like the internet it runs without government control, bitcoin has value because people who use it give it value, just like normal regular money, for example I wouldn't work for zimbawe dollars or US dollars but I'll happily work for brittish pounds, euros and bitcoins, my preferred currency to be paid in is bitcoin then they'll ask why I would accept bitcoins etc, I explain I travel a lot and also shop online a lot and that I was an early adopter of the internet when the majority found it strange, then when they ask why I wouldn't work for US dollars, I explain that I live in europe and the conversion rates would make it more effective for me to get paid in a european currency or bitcoin

use that as cash for shop fronts in the developing world for people to be able to cash in their bitcoin that is sent out there from relatives over seas, eventually people will keep more bitcoin for longer etc. but it'll make it easy for people to cash out etc, if we don't do it I guess eventually western union will or they'll try and get it regulated/delayed somehow, so best to  get a jump start.

cool good to hear, is there a sign at the bar?
I always feel weird when I go to a bar that is on coinmap but has no sign or anything, especially if I ask the staff "I'd like to pay in bitcoin" and they're like "what is that?"
if there is a sign at the bar "we accept bitcoin" then I simply say "I'll be paying in bitcoin" and point, if they're like "oh I'm not sure how to process that, the person who knows that is away today" I can simply say
"well you've poured my beer and that is the only currency on me, so I guess this one is on the house" lol

how about this
location 1 - shop counter
customer walks up, with item (lets say a fancy pair of shoes),
buys the item, then pays, but instead of paying with a card he hands $100 to a bunch of bankers (who happen to be just standing there next to the counter dressed up as bankers) 
the banks take $3 hand $97 to the seller then collapse to the ground in laughter.
The buyer and seller stand there looking in shock at them.
then it cuts to location 2.
2 people meet in a street, standing next to a car, one is buying car off the other, exact same thing, bankers there, they take the money, take a deduction, hand the money to the buyer, bankers drop to the ground in absolute hysterics 
then it cuts to location 3.
Indian or african (or some country with big usage of western union style payments) pretends to arrive from airport in country of origin, meets family member, hands money to bankers, they take their cut hands on remainder to relative, and once again drop to the ground in absolute hysterics.
then a something comment on the screen like "cut out the middle men" and someone pressing a send button 
total length around 30 seconds, total actors, say 3 bankers then atleast 2 other people to play the buyers and sellers, probably better with different people for each seller and same buyer for all scenes.

in the financial industry you never employ juniors, you employ people with atleast 10 years solid experience working with security.
Startups generally employ college kids who know very little but think they know everything, they'll work for peanuts and sleep under the desk, the correct way to run a bitcoin startup is to spend the money on employing highly experience professional coders, who won't sleep under the desk because they don't need to.

It would be the killer app if Facebook bought changetip, you see your friend checkin to bar on other side of world and then in front of everyone (on their Facebook checkin status) change tip them a beer, bars then all other shops etc with Facebook pages would want to accept it.
Makes more sense Facebook buys change tip than trying to make their own, as changetip is already on twitter and youtube, if Facebook started their own thing google wouldn't allow it, if google bought changetip Facebook wouldn't allow it, so Facebook should buy it

Sure the price is all over the place, but for anyone who has been around a while this kind of volatility isn't really volatile at all.  
I must say the talk of POW changes and forking all over the place is actually what I like about bitcoin, it's so dramatic, I find it entertaining and I know in the long run a solution will be found and the price will keep on up and the network will keep on being the longest decentralized currency out there.  
Before we know it, another halving event will come along (2020) and everyone will be wetting themselves even more than the great forking event.

It's getting down voted by ethereum shills, who have the whole argument of "ethereum will kill off everything because it has smart contracts" not realising that if ethereum ever replaced bitcoin and bitcoin lost it's value then ethereum would become worthless as people would forever be too afraid of the next replacement coming along.  
  
reality is smart contracts are great but should be a side channel, imagine trying to pay for your coffee but the fee is too high because of all the people running some contract game version of Zeros and Crosses lol.
small payments and contracts should all be side channels.

By running a node you're a true peer in the peer to peer sense.  
You keep a full copy of the Blockchain and validate it, you enforce network consensus as well as offering a free service to lite clients to connect to.  
The network needs nodes, the more lite clients existing, the more nodes required, the more nodes the better privacy for all as well as a more resilient network.  
  
If you have more than a few hundred $s in Bitcoin it makes sense to help protect your investment.

First thing you must do is make a backup of the hard drive.
Buy a Trezor.

Also if you find your brother has a Trezor hardware wallet I suggest you don't do too many attempts at guessing the password.
You need to get a copy of the seed (backup words list, it's either 12 or 24 random words)
Never post this seed list online or you will have instantly lost all of your coins.

Yes halvenings are known about decades in advance, yes part of the market has already priced it in, yes this is known as the efficient market hypothesis.  
  
However, 1 year out always starts to create a lot of buzz especially for newer people with fresh money, this in turn fuels a cycle of buzz which brings in new money lifting the price which further creates buzz.  
  
The actual effect on supply and demand takes several months after the halvening to show, causing a second run.

we need segwit plus a 4mb increase (after segwit goes out).
Segwit will open up whole new possibilities, but many transactions will still go the old way, a simple "send coin to address" I just downloaded some software and there was a bitcoin donate address, I used to send a dollar for 1 cent or less. Today my app wanted a fee of 50 cents, I couldn't justify giving a one off donation and paying a 50% transaction fee.
I'd never do this kind of transaction over lightning as I'm never going to pay that person again.  
  
I think lightning is the best thing for miners, they'll make a lot more in fees when the network grows a lot more.  
  
I've run a node for years and am now happy to increase the blocksize, but only if segwit is activated first.

This reminds me of Andreas's talk on dumb networks and how dumb networks always win over smart networks.
Dumb networks are apolitical and allow smart apps to be built on top of them.
Bitcoin is the dumb network of money.

Investing is like a tallest tree growing competition, where tallest tree gets you fame and glory, at first a bunch of people have small baby trees, you don't care as its not exciting, a few years later they have tall trees and are getting all the girls around to admire their tree.
You decide "omg, trees is where it's at!, I need to plant a tree"
But now all the tall trees are blocking the sunlight, so your only option is to spend a lot more money than the other guys did before you and buy a tall tree, rather than a cheap shrub.
Now this is going to cost you a lot of money for a tall tree, but not as much as when someone has to buy an even taller tree later, perhaps the new person will even buy your tree.
But you also run the risk that the whole forest of trees get disease and die, perhaps roses and flowers will become cool with the girls....and no one will even want tall trees, or perhaps some tree geeks will still love tall trees but no one else will care.

So, I thought I'd play around with some segwit transactions, my 2 cent fee transaction took 24 hours to get in a block.  
However, my 5 cent fee transaction got into the next block, as did my 9cent and 7 cent fee.  
As you can see though they all went into the one block, so it could be simply because the mempool is basically empty and a smart miner stuffed it in :)   
I find the following URL  is best to find the most up to date unconfirmed transaction count (for a website).  
FYI, my wallet used was  (obviously you must own a trezor) simply choose an insanely low fee, stop using wallets that don't allow this.   
I hope this helps :)

Segwit2x isn't simply a doubling of the blocksize, it's not just a move to 2mb (which can actually create 8mb blocks) it has scheduled increases built in to increase the blocksize to 32mb and beyond, totally out of control of everyone who wasn't in the closed door deal.

Read it and as a technical person I can't understand why non technical people want the technically illiterate to read it.  
  
What sold me on Bitcoin is the ideology, this isn't even in the white paper, eg the genesis block message, the monetary policy, supply and release set in stone.  
  
The whitepaper simply explains the technical workings, eg "Peer to Peer" or in plain English those running nodes are peers.  
And most important being that any node can leave and rejoin the network at anytime and be able to work out the correct chain due to the longest proof of work.  
  
Bitcoin to me:  
1. Peer to peer.   
2. Set in stone monetary supply, known issuance.   
3. Longest proof of work.  
  
If you look at the forks especially bcash you'd see it fails on all 3 points.

SHA-256 is a 32bit algorithm, if they get greedy we can always switch to SHA-512 which is a 64bit algorithm, I'd assume their equipment would become worthless and everyone else would learn a lesson from their mistake.

Well we deal with it by having the fees go up which eventually prices them out, it depends how deep their pockets are.  
Problem is it makes small fees expensive for everyone else.  
But once lightning is in place, you'll be able to do as many transactions as you want, however you'll still need to settle on chain, but a higher fee isn't as big an issue if it's to close off a million transactions etc.

When the bear whale dumped, it was a whale exiting, he thought the market was dying, he wanted to get his money out and run, seeing early adopters exit was a worrying sign, how many more whales until there was no liquidity left?  
  
The day of the bearwhale and the months following I will never forget, colleagues used to mock me constantly, I literally couldn't give them BTC for free.    
On the day of the bearwhale there was no institutional investors who could just suck it up, most VCs were openly bragging about how they wouldn't touch Bitcoin, the only thing that kept us going was that the bearwhale set a price as to not damage his position and thousands of us formed a phalanx and marched forward.  
In January 2015 it bottomed at $150, at that moment people thought the bearwhale made a smart move.

Being able to handle many transactions per second doesn't mitigate spam attacks, the spam is forever stored cheaply on the chain, forever slowing the time to validate the chain to get up to sync.

I'd want to say moon, however often in recessions their is less liquidity floating around buying gold etc , what really depends is how governments respond if it's via QE and currency debasement (printing) then Bitcoin should rise just buy doing nothing.  
What is interesting is if a recession with government money printing hits the same year as a Bitcoin halvening.
@_date: 2019-08-23 10:48:21
BCH was totally debased by going against Satoshi's vision of one block every ten minutes, Jihan gave himself over 70,000bcash by mining dozens of blocks per minute, completely against the white paper, completely against Satoshi's introduction message explaining how governments debase a currency.   
Completely against the hash chain consensus of nodes being able to leave and rejoin the network without trusting anything but the longest proof of work.

I've tried it yes, to dump my free Bcash, it's not the same old Bitcoin, it's centrally controlled, and Satoshi's monetary policy of one block every 10 minutes from 2009 to 2140 was destroyed, it's highly susceptible to spam attacks.

Bitcoin does roughly 300k transactions a day when on full hash rate, 
Bitcoin is currently at less than half hash rate and has 150k in the mempool, if miners didn't jump back and forth bitcoin would be soldiering on as normal.

He also spoke heavily of decentralisation and 1 CPU 1 vote, today its 1 ASIC manufacturer all votes.  
Fortunately Satoshi introduced his paper to a community of Cypherpunks for peer review and improvement, the white paper is exactly that, a science paper, not a religious text, this research has been on going ever since, today, while people like Roger Ver are still mining 1mb blocks others are mining Bitcoin improvement blocks, I can send a SegWit transaction for 10 cents.

There is a checksum check, there is a one in 4billion chance you can make a typo and end up with a valid address, now you can send bitcoin to real valid bitcoin addresses but that is all.  
This of course doesn't mean someone owns the private key for the address.   
I must add that Btrash is like a virus to bitcoin, it causes mass confusion and loss of funds, as it's using the same valid address format.  
Ethereum on the other hand has about a 1 in 400 chance of a typo being a valid address.

Centralisation, also watch the video, 340gb blocks are way too small, if we want digital cash we need petabyte blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:29:39
The key is to encourage everyone to optimize their systems, eg adopt segwit, batch transactions, schnoor sigs, use lightning or other future second layer solutions etc.  
Once blocks are full after all of this is implemented and fees aren't reasonable then the blocksize will be increased, Core devs have said this many many times before, but the conspiracy nuts will hunt around through the 400 devs to find someone that has said they don't ever want an increase, then they'll say "Loook!! look!! Core doesn't want an increase!!!"  
Core will increase, but if you simply increase now, then there is no benefits in optimizing and the can just gets kicked down the road.

This guy over paid, he didn't need a fee that high, however $1 to send $7500 isn't that bad.

Many are legit, due to the Btrash EDA (totally against Satoshi's vision on monetary policy) Bitcoins hash rate is 1/3 what it should be, so not enough blocks are coming through fast enough, have enough miners mining blocks and that would be down to around 40,000 of which most of them are single cent spam transactions.  
The people attacking bitcoin have a lot of money to burn.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:43:32
The EDA broke the fundamental rules that Satoshi put in place, the monetary supply of bitcoin was what Satoshi's main goal was, hence the reason he constantly spoke of central banks debasing the currency, Bitcoin isn't meant to be all mined until the year 2140.   
Current EDA brings this down to around 2060.

It's not just transferring a 10mb block, you also need to send / receive that data to at least a dozen other nodes, you also need to be able to validate all those transactions, store them and most importantly serve up the entire blockchain to new nodes joining the network, new nodes need to be able to validate the entire blockchain every single transaction, meanwhile the chain is still rapidly growing while they're trying to catch up, the new node is also now requesting terabytes of data from existing nodes which are sitting there supposedly only transmitting "a 10mb block"

Perfect time to open up a lightning channel for those who need Bitcoin for muh coffee.  
Removing small retail transactions from the chain via lightning and exchange to exchange transfers via liquid will free up a lot of space.  
This is scaling, it's a shame some companies are bad actors.

It's inflation broke Satoshi's monetary supply rate, the most solid feature of Bitcoin, 1 block every 10 minutes, not 40 per minute lol 
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:09:01
I'll try and inform you, unless you're just trolling.  
When you make a lightning payment, it's a real bitcoin transaction, 100% real bitcoin transaction, the difference is, you don't submit it the network, but give it someone else, they can submit it to the network when they choose (just like if you gave someone a paper wallet, it's 100% real bitcoin) and close the channel, or you could keep sending them new transactions that cancel out the previous transactions.  
How a hub would work is that it'll help route your transaction via Onion style routing (more privacy than a regular bitcoin transaction), these transactions will use multiple real transactions chained across the lightning network, no one will know who is being paid but everyone will be getting paid.  
You could run a hub.  
Imagine you go into bar for the night, you buy 10 drinks and everyone else buys 10 drinks, with this, everyone could open a channel with the bar and only pay 1 opening and 1 closing channel fee, or.... even better if they frequent the bar often, they could make hundreds of payments before the channel is closed.  
This is the simplest explanation I can think of, I hope this helps.

You always hold the private keys, that is how lightning works, it requires a Bitcoin Smart contract of which is simply a Bitcoin transaction, you hold this private key, it signs new lightning transactions, lightning transactions are actually regular Bitcoin transactions, these regular Bitcoin transactions are sent across the lightning network, when you wish you can close the channel by submitting the Bitcoin transaction to the Blockchain rather than the lightning network.

What happens is price increases in run up, then it happens and price doesn't suddenly moon so it falls as weak hands sell, this sell pressure removes the effect from any reduction in mining, once sellers stop price will go sideways for a few months and reduction in new coins will start to take effect on market and price will rise.  
  
The only other certainty is just like the last 2 there will be a bunch of bears playing down the halvening, it's simple supply and demand, the bears don't realise a lot of coins on the market each day are fresh from miners, most secondhand coins are long term HODL'd the Blockchain shows us this.

"As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties: - boring grey in colour - not a good conductor of electricity - not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either - not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose and one special, magical property: - can be transported over a communications channel If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it. Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you've suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange. (I would definitely want some) Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it. I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value. But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something. (I'm using the word scarce here to only mean limited potential supply)" - Satoshi Nakamoto.

Roger "bcash muh coffee, we're all Craig Wright" Ver is an investor.  
  
Bitpay was behind segwit2x which was a corporate take over attempt, they tried to take control away from 500core Devs and replace them all with one dev who was actively working on a shitcoin at the same time.  
When segwit2x went to activate it spectacularly blew up bring it's network down.  
   
Then they decided to once again ignore community consensus and support another even worse shitcoin called Bcash where Jihan "fuck your mother if you want fuck" Wu broke Satoshi's vision of 1 block every 10 minutes to give himself over 100,000 free Bitcoin, completely breaking the core design monetary design of Bitcoin.  
  
Then Roger "we're all Craig Wright" Ver (Yes he is on the record pumping known fraud Craig Wright as Satoshi lol!) Teamed up with Jihan to attack Bitcoin and pump Bcash, he bought the Twitter Bitcoin handle, actively publicly tried to buy this sub off Reddit then pushed his investments in Bitpay and Blockchain to accept Bcash.

Step one, buy a Trezor.
Step 2, buy $1k from exchange, sent immediately to trezor, verify you understand the process.
Step 3. Buy $5k
Step 4, buy $6k.
Step 5, buy $8k.
Remember to send to trezor as soon as you have the coins.
What might be smart is to chat to the exchange first.
Xapo, Coinbase, Circle etc.

Sure, you will send money to exchange, when exchange gets money they will give you Bitcoin, it will show in your online account.
Let's say 5 minutes later they get hacked, now all your Bitcoin is gone.
What you want to do is transfer that Bitcoin off of the exchange, send it to your wallet, the best most secure yet simple to use is the trezor hardware wallet.
It's worth the hundred bucks.
When you setup your trezor it will give you 24 words to write down, save them!!, Don't save them on a computer ever!!.
Write them down on paper, if you ever lose your trezor you buy another trezor and input the 24 words, then you have all of your Bitcoin back.
If you plan to buy $20k but won't invest $100 in a trezor I have no time for you.
I wish you luck
@_date: 2016-09-17 04:58:26
It's good because having a store OB on clearnet is like saying "hello world, at this IP address is a Bitcoin user, you can try and hack me here".
Even for legitimate usage TOR is a good way to help further secure your store.
The blockchain shows transactions from one address to another, but who are those people?, What are they buying?
That is the more complicated part, perhaps it's one person buying chocolates off another, the buyer got his Bitcoin off a guy he met in a pub in some foreign land, they never exchanged names, it was 5 years ago. Etc etc

A big problem is propagation of blocks, a miner finds a block and starts mining on top of it straight away, giving him a head start, while the previous block propagates.  
Imagine you only had a 12 second block time and a 100mb block, on a % level the miner who just mined a block has a huge head start on the rest of the miners.

Correct BCH EDA took hash rate from Bitcoin resulting in fewer blocks, this along with deliberate delaying of Segwit adoption + rapid rise in price all culminated in a longer delay of cheep fee transactions getting into a block.

No, simply use the blockchain, start with one address, pay to 21 addresses a small amount of Bitcoin, give a single private key to each buyer, in the future they can pass along the key if they sell it, buyer would move money to new address and hold both keys etc.  
You simply publish online the original address that the 21 addresses come from.  
It's simpler than using OP_RETURN.

I've noticed this too, they're what are called the "early adopters" they're freaking me out.  
I've heard people around town mentioning it too, it blows me away.  
I never bring it up with friends, but now if I'm out with friends for dinner, one will bring it up and others will instantly know what it is and start discussing it, a few years back if it was mentioned, no one would have a clue what is.  
  
I do get a whole lot of the "how many do you have??"  
a year or 2 back people used to say "you must have hundreds or atleast dozens!"  
Now people say "but how much do you have? do you own a whole bitcoin??" ..... I simply say "listen, if I owned 0.1 bitcoin I wouldn't say how much I owned, in a few years if people find out I owned at some stage 0.1 bitcoin, I could be a target as people might think I may still have 0.005 bitcoin left"

Which is perfectly fine, let's not forget these transactions had to go into a segwit address then out of a segwit address, as it's not until the segwit address is spent from do we know it's a segwit address.  
Sending money to a segwit address simply looks the same as a multi sig transaction, which is the beauty of segwit, it works with older clients just fine, it's a "soft fork" and a very successful one at that.

When you save a little more, buy a Trezor hardware wallet, when you set it up, it'll give you 24 words, write these down, keep multiple copies, this way if the trezor is ever lost, you can recover your bitcoin.

It's a yin and yang space, bitcoin is the perfect middle ground coin, it has a scripting language, it's fast (cryptographically) it's lightweight (scripts aren't huge, blockchain won't bloat), it's the ideal number of coins for store of value and it has solid history.   
Ethereum will scale terribly but innovates fast  
Monero has good security but terrible transactions throughput (coming from the monero devs not me), also due to it's lack of scripting functionality (at present) it doesn't support even the most basic contract, a multi sig contract.  
In this space, everything has a trade off, bitcoin is in the middle, somethings are far to the right, lots of functionality, terrible blockchain bloat, somethings are far to the left great privacy but at a trade off of everything else.  
Personally I think Mimblewimble will wipe out most privacy coins.

Gemini is a hosted wallet (eg you have an account with them), so you don't really have any Bitcoin, what you have is an IOU from gemini that says "trust us, we will give you your Bitcoin if you ask for it".

It won't be several gb, people will reduce transactions, but it will be large, eventually difficulty will drop, miners will leave 2x to mine Bitcoin at a lower difficulty dropping 2x price and difficulty, Bitcoin difficulty will rise and miners will jump to Bitcoin cash, then 2x, Bitcoin etc, everyone loses a bit in this game, eventually everyone realises 2x has no Devs and all the innovation is on the Bitcoin chain.

I'm not sure what Gemini's policy is with forks, they may give you the coins on the other fork, or they might keep it for them self, I highly recommend you buy a trezor from trezor.io , I used a trezor, I'm in no way affiliated with the company, feel free to instead buy a ledger nano S, just make sure you keep the coins on a hardware device that you own, rather than on an exchange, if an exchange gets hacked then all your coins are gone.  
When you buy a hardware device make sure the first thing you do when setting it up is write down the 24 word seed onto a piece of paper, never write that down on a computer, it could be hacked, have a virus etc.

I think hard forks can be done, they just need to be carefully built to include something for everyone, I think if Devs (core consensus) plus users wanted it, exchanges and miners would follow, they might want an blocksize bump though, but that is eventually inevitable.

Browsing the clear net over TOR is dangerous, browsing .onion urls is ok as it's all encrypted end to end, but to visit a clear net website requires a tor exit node, this exit node can launch man in the middle attacks, you could think you're visiting one website but the exit node could inject scripts to steal your coins or grab your cookie and be you or any number of attacks, never login to any clear net website over TOR, local Bitcoins should have their own TOR address like Facebook does.

Here is a good write up 
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:03:49
That is the problem, Bitcoin could simply up the blocksize and bloat it's blockchain too.
A Bitcoin node doing 300k TXN per day uses under 8% CPU, ethereum node doing same number uses 80% CPU.   
What do you think happens to both of these when TXN count doubles?  
  
Ether blockchain is over 300gb and growing at 3gb a day, BTC chain grows at under 200mb a day.  
BTC chain can be fully synched in 12 hours , no one knows how long Ethereum would take as everyone gives up after a few weeks.  
  
I hope this helps you understand, there is no golden bullet in this space.

he just made his point, what is your point by asking "What's your point?" I find it mind numbing when someone makes their point and someone doesn't like it, so they say "what's your point?" as some kind of "I'm smarter than you!" come back, it looks childish.  
Sure Antpool mined more blocks, but look at the percentages.

Seriously though $10,000 is the moon, the moon is a stepping stone, once we reach the moon we plan our trip to Mars!, $100k.  
After Mars we explore the Moons of Jupiter, also known as $1million

What fees are you talking about?  
You sent $5 into change tip, then you could tip 5,000 times and had no fees.  
It was off chain, they need to make a profit, they didn't come up with a profitable business model before going out of business.  
It has nothing to do with Bitcoin fees.  
My average fee this year for bitcoin transactions was 9cents, but now I have segwit I never pay more than 2 cents. 
  
Now would free online bitcoin tips solve the problem?  
  
The great thing about changetip was you could tip people who didn't have a bitcoin address yet.

It's growing every day, as more companies implement it into their wallets and exchanges the higher usage grows, the irony is most of the companies pushing segwit2x have not implemented segwit yet, also we have small blockers like Bitcoin.com that refuse to mine blocks larger than 1mb in size.   
The 2x companies should all first adopt segwit, plus adopt batching of transactions etc, this will free up blockspace and bring down fees, then we bring in schnor sigs and other improvements, then once blocks are full we increase the size, this has always been cores plan.

If you're using an SPV wallet (which the bcash community recommends) then yes bcash payments will fail, at the last hard fork they rammed through 20&amp; of nodes stayed on the old chain, so 20&amp; of payments will have been on the wrong chain that didn't have enough hash power to create blocks.

He co wrote the paper like an academic and moved on.  
This is normal of many academics, not everyone tries to profit from everything instantly.  
A good example is Adam Back, Satoshi approached him for peer review and he did the academic thing and gave him his review and Satoshi updated his white paper.  
People of less integrity like Roger Ver thinks Adam should have ignored Satoshi and just got mining so as to profit as much as possible, for some everything should be looked at with a capitalist's eye, for others often intellectual intrigue can come first.

Copied from a comment here   
  


See the last image, the orange parts are the signature data [it used to be the light-blue parts as seen in the other images].
The signature data is no longer committed to by sticking them in the transactions at each branch of the merkle tree along with the corresponding transaction, but are instead committed to in the coinbase transaction (first transaction in the block).
That data corresponding to each segwit transaction in the block, and the pair being valid, is validated by every segwit node, and every miner [that wants to be able to sell their hashrate to the network]. For this reason, the witnesses/transaction data is part of the transaction.
PSA for this blasted subreddit:
IT IS SEGREGATED WITNESS, NOT ELIMINATED WITNESS.

If you know how Proof of Work works, Bitcoin has 9 years of immutability, every second the security is greater than the previous second, nothing can top this.  
It also has by far the best developers.  
We never left TCP/IP because someone said "Hey I have a better protocol".

Not this nonsense, more people will be attracted to Bitcoin as it will have more use cases, more users = more people to run nodes = greater decentralisation.  
More users = higher Bitcoin price, higher Bitcoin price means greater dollar value of miner reward.  
More payment channels opening and closing, and yes this will then require a blocksize increase so more fees again for miners

the way they implement social networks into their wallet eg Twitter facebook, but then claim to be a bitcoin bank is childish, every time I scroll the wallet app it tries to open twitter.
I contacted them in the past and said having twitter and facebook in it makes it seem childish, support even agreed with me lol.
now when ever I contact them for support they never respond ever!, where as I always find Circle responds to me very fast.
I'm currently in the middle of withdrawing all my coins from my Xapo vault but I can only seem to do them one a day, and then it still throws an error saying its failed even though it hasn't, I contacted support but once again no response

You need to factor in that in Dec 2017 we had a wild fluctuating hash rate due to Roger and Co Bcash attack. If we had stable increasing Hash rate the mempool and fees would have been very different, now factor in had the bad actors not delayed segwit for 2 years and big companies had implemented segwit plus batching and Dec 2017 would have been smooth sailing.

Slush's mining pool has mined over a million bitcoins without him stealing any.  
Johoe also works for Trezor, he could have easily vanished into the night with 800btc from Blockchain.com's security hole however gave it all back.   
  
Imagine you already made many thousands of Bitcoin and are still making many more, would you suddenly risk many years in prison and have to live on the run all for a few extra dollars.  
  
There is a huge difference between Trezor which has been selling their open source hardware / software wallet since 2013 and the cheaper closed hardware ledger of recent years who basically has a Reddit shill army.  
  
Oh yeah, Ledgers chips are stamped with "ledger" at the chip factory, the chip supplier knows exactly where those chips are going..... (but don't worry it's $20 cheaper).

This is technically called a hashchain, basically if you change say row 10, then the hash in row 11 makes no sense.  
Each row would have a hash that composed of the previous row in the the data base and the current row, this is a hash chain.  
  
rowOneHash = hash(row1)  - hash of row one  
rowTwoHash = hash(rowOneHash + row2)   
rowThreeHash = hash(rowTwoHash + row3)   
  
As you can see if you were to change an earlier row, the hashes in the following rows would no longer make sense, this is nothing new, it's a hashchain, a block chain is basically the same but instead of a simple row being hashed it's a block of transactions.  
I hope this makes sense?

ASIC boost doesn't give them more hashing power, it simply allows them to do the same hashing but with less energy consumption.

Will be a lot more dumping then as the Floppening is happening, seen it all before where overhyped less secure, less scalable, inflationary crap flops

Bitcoin addresses have a checksum, the odds of making a typo and having an address remain valid is like 1 in 4 billion.  
Ethereum addresses however have no checksum.

When you keep your Bitcoin on an exchange you basically own an IOU, when you hold the Bitcoin on your own wallet you own it, eg no one can steal it or confiscate it.  
If you run android install mycelium, or iPhone install breadwallet.  
If you own a couple of hundred $s then buy a hardware wallet, either Trezor or ledger nano S

GDAX does around $100million a day and they make 0.3% in fees, so $300k a day, how many staff do they have?  
$300k * 365 = $109,500,000.  
They should be profitable.

No, I'm not implying 100% revenue = 100% profit, if I was I wouldn't have said "they should be profitable" or asked "how many staff do they have?", I'd have simply stated they're making a killing.
@_date: 2017-06-25 00:45:05
Yes of course, when you first setup the hardware wallet it asks you to write down 24 words that it generates, you can reenter these 24 words into any compatible device or software etc and you'll have all your coins and history back.

The hype around ICOs ended, ETH had more sellers than buyers, ETH has a huge! Premine, this premine means 75% of all ether was printed out of thin air and wasn't worth its hype based market cap, as ether crashes so does the scam coins it created...   
It's obvious really.

I'd like one like this, 1mb + segwit followed by schnorr sigs giving us 3 to 4mb blocks, then every 144 block (once a day) we have a 15mb block, this 15mb block is only valid if it's full, this block is to help clean the backlog, while only adding an extra 15mb a day.  
Yes, I know the following block will be more often won by a miner close to the miner who wins the 15mb block, but after that, the game continues.
