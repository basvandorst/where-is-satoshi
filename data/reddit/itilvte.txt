This is very informative . Thank you. Please I would appretiate immensely a more in deep break down of some of the points, for example about the the block size division, the hard forks being or not a big deal, and the censorship and moderation battles. And how does it all of this compares to real experience in other cryptocurrencies outside this particular clash of communities? Or are there no other similar experiences? Are there any reasonable supporting points for each claim on any side? or at the end we can only blindly speculate and have faith?  Thank you so much for your input.

Well of course is not exactly bitcoin what he is talking about, but the core principles underneath any monetary system that humans could use. That's what bitcoin seems to be headed on, addressing this principles more directly, being limitless in comparison and more fair-play than any of the previous systems we've had.

It will bring economic peace of mind.
For it being neutral, global and transparent. For being deflationary (for increasing its value), and for being decentralized, (for not being based on a trusted small and corruptible third party, but in the frame of reality of the group).
It is already showing it doesn't hurt shopping. It merely challenges a psychologycal habit. Merchants needs to push the prices down. Because money naturally increases its value. Exactly the opposite that what happens with a deflationary unit.
And we all as buyers have needs that we value more than money (that's why we recognize them as needs and not whims). Maybe even present for friends we value more than money.
I believe it will also help reducing the madness.
Knowing that money appreciates implies not worrying about money that looses its value when it's not spent. That's stressing. The new kind of economy would serve like psychologycal motivation. It motivates confidence in self sustenance hability, is an example of a property that grows, it motivates patience, and the hability to save up. Maybe only mildly. But it's a welcomed change for once for a default property of money. It just needed to be controlled from the ground up.
The need of work is a social construct, we can re-arrange that construct as we see that it fits better. The construct is already changing because of the increased technification, enourmous productivity and globalization. Society doesn't need full employement of purposeless jobs that a machine can do for people that don't want to buy things they don't need. A job, as an imposition, like an an unavoidable condition could be regarded someday as a form of slavery. And a job that somebody chooses to do, could be better paid, because once we put out of the list of reasons for having a job the need of surviving, the next thing that moves use is to find our limits, and that leads to excellence.
Decentralization will bring nice things, like the ability for the needs to meet the means in a micro scale, in an interconnected world, in an efficient way. Jobs will be casual. Jobs will not be forced. Jobs will meet a precise need. Jobs will be well paid. And there will be space for everybody, because the decentralization and interconnectedness allows for the social structures to autoregulate themselves with less friction and human corruption.
That's my bet. And that's why I believe that this THING that was invented five years ago as a son of the community, this little thing is really a very funny pretty tool made in the image of the humanity that was in need, just when it was about the damn right time.
tl;dr; Bitcoin brings economic equality, in the same way internet enables information equality. Because it gives access to a global network of specialized consensus. That leads to good things.

I believe it's already called bitcoin!
But I don't see why we couldn't call 100 satoshis a Watt or something like that.
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:21:41
Well, that was my math:
1.21 * 1000000000 (giga) * 100 (satoshis per watt) / 1000000 (satoshis per bitcoin) = 121000
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:43:43
That'd be... 121,000 bitcoin! [&amp;

He's right. BTC can now handle between 3 and 5 tr./sec. BCH can now handle between 28 and 34 tr./sec. BTC looks forward in the longrun to lightning network  technlogy which could improve dramatically the tr./sec without increasing blocksize, but wont make really affordable to make the 1st layer transactions due to prohibitibe fees, and BCH looks forward to graphene which could increase to 280-340 tr. /sec without increasing the blocksize, and also is experimenting on increasing the blocksize to determine which are the real limits, to prioritize an affordable use of the 1st layer.

I like this article for what it brings up, which is not talked about very often.
The thing is, that is precisely the whole point of Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin has to work in the real world, full of untrustworthy people. Because it's money we're talking about.
The game change that Bitcoin brought to the table is that every self interested actor in the Bitcoin system that cares mostly about himself while using it, is helping the system as a while, making it more secure...
...As long as no single entity controls the majority of the hash rate, of course. Although it'd not be automatically unsafe if someone had 51%, just would made it possible to attack it, very unsuccessfully at first, but I think it could become really dangerous before reaching 70%.
But that doesn't automatically mean that the system would be as resistant to dishonest developers of the same system, which we could say it's maybe the Achilles hill of every project on Earth? And I wonder if studies has been done in that regard.
Maybe there's no solution for that. Because as he says even honest behavior while developing can not be easily differentiated from having hidden interests. But we already have that present in the legacy financial system. So maybe we will be ok.
My hope is that a free market can educate us all in what really works, to allow Bitcoin to evolve, to fulfill its promise, to make it work better and better, under normal conditions, under pressure, under attack, always.
Because the believable promise of Bitcoin is that it can't be stopped, it can only be delayed. Bitcoin seems more and more like the idea whose time has come.

Maybe it's more like linking to a webmail service like gmail instead of to the download of outlook express.
IRC is IM, you have to be online and connected to a server in order to send and receive messages. If anything that's similar to LN.
