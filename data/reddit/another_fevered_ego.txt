If anyone can do it perhaps you can pm me and we can chat a bit on how a person as myself can get into bitcoin

No but it will get hijacked by somebody.

Aboot time!

Not good for anything other than to create a false sense of legitimacy.  
@_date: 2014-10-17 02:55:23
What steps did you take to make this into a business?
@_date: 2014-06-25 18:06:03
Nothing wrong with the currency. What's wrong is the logistics of an already decrepit usps trying to verify parcels.

Bitcoin is a game changer, however at this point in time it reminds me of the gold rush. Those with the know how and equipment not to mention who are using this currency to generate wealth are very few. The years will tell if it will suffer the same fate as the gold rush did.

You are right, Canadians are funny.

Bitcoin sounds like anarchy. Everyone is an equal and there is no ruling or centralized entity regulating and making policy. Bitcoin will either be hijacked or will be short lived like gold miners from the gold rush era the few who have the know how will be able to stake their claim. it's only human to fuck each other in the asses.

It would be air baltic.

Doesn't come as a just cause either. Most likely backed up by fat cats who want to have an ace under their sleeve in case bc leads to something substantial.

It's really up to the powers that be. The central banks, governments, bank cartels, the market and the people. In my opinion we are gaining great technological achievement but still have some social problems dating back thousands of years. Maybe we will go to bottle caps like in fallout.
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:35:11
The latter. Maybe it will become some kind of orwellian dough. An Implant in your arm would be a wallet amongst other things.

Funny how there was an add on bacon reader for PayPal as I read this comment. I'm fine with fiat. If anything, I'm making tons of money off my investments and properties. I also have some venture capital I've pooled with some other people in a silicon valley firm. I own a small business in Costa Rica,  in short... I can sit at home and make 10k a day.
@_date: 2014-06-25 07:27:09
I agree your idea doesn't make sense. You could just say the usps should accept bitcoin.

He's either sleeping with the fishes.  Left town for a while, or been given money to lay low and stop talking shit.

Awsome I can now deal drugs in an more efficient way. Or launder my money.
@_date: 2014-10-19 16:04:33
This gives me an idea to start a troll company. I live in silicon valley. I think I could pitch this to some investors. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 03:27:36
I need to find out about this as I need to send money from Slovakia to Colombia.

Gold is now a commodity. Bitcoins value won't decline but will lead to the fast generation of wealth for some and ruin for others. Than banking cartels and governments step in to regulate. And it will become a medium of transaction.  The same way gold became a commodity. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 09:29:41
I like crypto currency but it is too volatile and I would like some regulation and maybe a tad of centralization. It may go against the whole point of it, like pouring water in your whisky...but I still like a little bit of water in my whiskey.
@_date: 2014-08-01 23:29:31
Not really. These countries are all about regulation. It's no surprise they don't support bc
