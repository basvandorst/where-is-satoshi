Not surprised, the Conservative Canadian government just released a budget saying bitcoin is a threat.. And this guy is from Ottawa apparently.

Who benefits from bitcoin going down? What better way to take bitcoin down by taking the main exchange down? Just these last two weeks, in the new Canadian budget, the government called Bitcoin a threat.  If Canada think it's a threat, imagine how many others behind these scenes think it's the same thing, and might take action against it..  Just thinking out loud.

Stop reading news if you don't agree with journalists' jobs.

I don't think it's wise to advise people to invest EVERYTHING into any one single thing.  That's bad advice.

You referencing a security guide by Apple is supposed to give your statement on iOS security validity? 
@_date: 2015-10-19 17:02:16
I never mentioned Android, I mentioned Google services. Blackberry is known for being tops in mobile security, Ur using an argument that they have apps that iOS is a better choice, when it's not. Find me a flaw from Blackberrys OS security other than the number of employees they employ.

This just in.   you wanna revise iOS being the most secure operating system? Even apples approval process can't catch all Malware. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 15:35:14
iOS secure? Hahahaa

If I want mobile security, I'd get a blackberry phone, not iOS, who permitted brute force attacks on their iCloud, had/has no two step factor authentification, and would let ppl log into their apple accounts from foreign countries like Russia without even alerts to the owner of the accounts. Please don't talk to me about Apple and security they have clearly failed for so long until now. Blackberry OS and Google services offer the best security from an OS and services standpoint of view. Apple is nowhere near  in security.

Nobody knows. Take the amount you want to invest and divide by ten, and invest once a week for the next 2.5 months, no matter what the price is. That's a more balanced approach.

I don't think qubits in physics will ever be mainstream.  Megabits and gigabits are the only mainstream measurements used today, for now..

Awesome idea
