You're only thinking about the technologies that ended up succeeding: What about the Orbo, or XHTML as the successor to HTML, or VBScript, or Gopher, or BeOS, or Google Wave, or Silverlight, or Posterous?

payment in Bitcoin or anything else that can be freely converted to fiat currency has always been *allowed*, but NZ [just provided guidance]( about the tax treatment of crypto-payments:

Keep in mind that the word "is" does not imply "in an ideal world in which Bitcoin is the primary means of exchange and most prices are denominated in it".
You'd still have the problem that its total supply could not react in any way to the real economy, so any attempt to estimate the real value of one's Bitcoin holdings in the future would be fraught with uncertainty; at least there would be no such thing as a "Bitcoin mother lode" (akin to the finds that led the value of precious metals to crash in olden times) as long as there were no way competing crypto-tokens could take hold, but it would function better as a store of value if you were able to reliably estimate the future value of current Bitcoin holdings, which would require forecasting the real economy itself instead of being able to rely on some central authority to ensure a consistent rate of deflation (in much the same way as real central banks try to ensure a consistent, low, and positive rate of inflation).
^(On the other functions of money, volatility in reality makes it poor as a unit of account, and unpredictability even in an ideal world makes it poor as a standard of deferred payment; I'm not sure you'd want to see lenders or debtors feeling cheated just because the value of Bitcoin changed differently from how their projections had it. Also, the inherently deflationary nature of Bitcoin in the ideal world leads to hoarding, which leads to economic depression, akin to what happened with the gold standard, which lasted less than a century everywhere I'm aware of, and which is why central banks nowadays err on the side of currency inflation.)

It's not good as a store of value, because its value fluctuates wildly; it's a bit better as a medium of exchange, although transactions do require about an hour to be sure they've been confirmed, and there's always a middle-man in the network, requiring a transaction fee.
^(Yes, I realize that there are also fees involved with transmitting fiat currencies over a network, but you can avoid this in person-to-person transactions by using cash, while there's no way to avoid the verification fees for payment with Bitcoin or other crypto-tokens.)

It's actually hard to figure out the [total amount]( of USD, partly because it is used unofficially in much of the world (in addition to the many foreign countries that have [adopted the USD outright]( still, an estimate for the monetary base (actual coins and Federal Reserve Notes, whether in Federal Reserve deposits or not) in April 2013 was $3T, while an estimate for the M2 money supply (coins and FR notes in circulation, along with demand deposits such as checking accounts and small-amount and short-term deposit accounts, like CDs under $100K, savings accounts, money market accounts, and retail money market mutual funds) was $10.5T.
^(Of course, that brings up the issue of why these measures are so different, and the answer is fractional-reserve banking, which itself is a whole other load of controversy in Austrian and Bitcoiner circles.)
Still, a more important measure is the [change in the value of the currency itself]( which can be measured in many ways (the "chained CPI" sounds better, but its Wikipedia article lacks a neat graph), but no matter how it's done, the trend is clear: Since the start of the Millennial generation (after the Fed learned from the [stagflation]( of the 1970s and its efforts to [target low inflation]( bore fruit), the annualized inflation rate for the USD has stayed within a range of 0 to 5%, narrowing over the decades.
This means that you can count on your USD holdings losing about 2% of their value every year if you just hold on to them, rather than investing them (even in something like a savings account, which probably will not provide greater than 2% annual interest), and take that into account when estimating how much your holdings will be worth in the future, because the Fed has policy tools to [nudge inflation closer to 2% per year]( (NOTE: The Fed does not target inflation in the version of the CPI that I linked to earlier, but rather the [PCEPI]( which again lacks a neat graph.)
Something like this is done by the central banks of every developed country (with the EU in an odd situation, because monetary policy is conducted on a multi-country basis, and an individual member of the Eurozone does not control its own currency and so cannot easily modify its own inflation rate, even while budgets and trade balances are still per-country).
^(No such tools exist for a decentralized currency with an eventually fixed amount of tokens, so in the ideal world under the Bitcoin standard, the value of your Bitcoin holdings depends on the size of the overall economy and is more difficult to estimate into the future.)

No: The key issue is how wildly the [real value]( a measure of purchasing power, changes; it takes years for a typical fiat currency to show the kind of proportional value-change that a crypto-token regularly shows in a day.


There are only two ways I can think about: Lightning Network (which does actually rely on additions to the blockchain to work) or trading private keys (which then introduces massive problems with divisibility, akin to treating crypto-wallets like stone money).

It's a command telling a bot to credit a Litecoin wallet owned by the person replied to with $10 worth of Litecoin from the replier's registered Litecoin wallet; Litecoin is similar to Bitcoin except that it's easier for people using ordinary hardware to actually mine it, but they don't share a blockchain or any other aspect of their networks.
