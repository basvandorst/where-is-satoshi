@_date: 2018-11-15 19:34:45
thats unnecessary. you have enough incentive to run a node if you use it to independently validate your transactions. because you gain in censorship resistance and privacy. if you want bitcoins work for them. you don't have to serve transactions to any light client request. you can set up blocks only mode and use the node just for you.
and keep this in mind you are using a node for YOUR own benefit. if we started paying node operators that would mean we are using you as middlemen for light clients. and bitcoin is about disrupting middlemen and verifying all by yourself without relying on someone else.

* when you give away your mining power 
* when you use cloud wallets so other company holds and secures your bitcoins,

all those things damage bitcoin decentralization and censorship resistance.

no way. I dont like it. you are putting miners as middlemen because they need to produce signatures manually. current system just takes burned energy into account.
since mining is centralized nowadays you will make bitcoin more vulnerable to censorship.

someone said that it is easy to manipulate mistrutful people if you find out how to turn them upon someone else, give them a common enemy. most of (early) bitcoiners are people that do not trust institutions, and most believe in conspiracies.

@_date: 2018-11-17 20:20:36


not only that. also  the extreme volatility.

blockchain is a piece of the bitcoin puzzle. just one. bitcoin would not work without the other pieces too.
beware of those that want to sell you blockchain alone. because they dont understand how things work.
bitcoin functionally is two things: a currency and a payment system. And on top of that you can build many applications. it is experimental but works,
@_date: 2018-11-13 19:23:09
bitcoin is experimental, not yet ready for widespread use. it wll disrupt bankng and finance as we know it. it is the cheapest digital payment sytem. it is very convenient and functions with no middlemen, just transactions between people. it will give back the power and control of your money to you.

@_date: 2018-11-11 12:46:08
that would result in a tragedy of the commons, where the centralized miners with more powerful and expensive machines will decide which machine can validate the blocks to remain in consensus.
by ruling out most computers (home pcs, r pis) they are destroying decentralization and they will decide what chain is the valid one.
miners would start partnering with cloud providers, horrible for bitcoin. miners dont give a shit about decentralization, they only care about mining returns.
@_date: 2018-11-12 19:04:39
All the hashpower in the world can't create a secure coin. 
the block reward miners earn to solve a block is coded as a consensus rule. I have a question for you: why miners haven't yet increased their payout for the block reward if they are in charge of the rules?
the truth is, the decentralized network of full nodes keep miners in check, because miners would decide very happily to create inflationary reward. and they do not do that because they want to keep in consensus and collect the rewards, enforced by the network of full nodes.
by the way the mining reward is specified by full nodes and miners must wait to spend it for 100 blocks.
so miners are kept in check by full nodes, that's why bitcoin is a decentralized system. miners are not in charge. it's people using their personal full nodes to check their transactions.

closed blockchains where trusted parties manage the entries is nonsense. its the inefficient equivalent of a traditional database.
open blockchains is the true innovation. and to secure an open blockchain you need to have a blockchain plus an incentive system with an internal currency (bitcoins).
the thing is open blockchains will disintermediate financial and payment middlemen so they are trying to sell bitcoin as obsolete and blockchain alone as the true innovation (which isnt true) and create closed systems with it.
you only need an open blockchain where you can't trust the parties involved. if you trust the parties involved, or you  know another way of agreeing on something through other means, then you dont need a blockchain. blockchain is ONLY for situations where you have to agree on something with parties, node, miners, people, etc trying to cheat and game the system. That's what bitcoin solved and why it wasn't ever hacked.
and bitcoin is the original and most secure blockchain to date.

you say that no one had access to your trezor and your passphrase. If you are 100% sure of that I'd contact trezor team and send them your trezor for them to reverse engineer.
the problem is you updated the firmware. so I dont know if you can provide previous firmware maybe malicious firmware to trezor.
it would be very useful for trezor to publish some guidelines for customers on how to proceed in case they think they were scammed or their device tampered with (through the distribution chain maybe). if that exists I'm not aware.
maybe there's not much they can do in that case

1. Run your full node with [Bitcoin Core]( and [Electrum Personal Server](
2. Verify everything. Developer keys:
    * **Electrum Wallet**: Keys [here](
    * **Bitcoin Core**: Keys [kere](
    * **Electrum Personal Server**: Keys [here](
To import the keys and verify follow [this]( tutorial more or less.
For additional security think of switching to a llinux platform, as windows is more vulnerable to malware. [Ubuntu]( for example 


yes it can happen with a hardware wallet because the attack requires action from the user when trying to send a transaction. I don't know abut any other wallet. This kind of attack requires that the user falls for the false warning message. If you ignore suspicious messages you are safe. But the wallet shouldn't allow this anyways.
@_date: 2018-12-30 14:58:31
this looks promising.
@_date: 2018-12-27 12:38:30
It seems like it is related to this issue
But the main problem is 
1. the user was connecting to someone else's server, instead of verifying themselves the transaction by running their own server Running your own server / full node is always the recommended way of using bitcoin.
2. Also each time you download a release from electrum you have to verify the signatures.
If you do both things you wont be affected by this issue.
