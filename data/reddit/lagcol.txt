There is no "new" way. It's the same in 2017 as it will be in 2018. And no, the taxing from crypto to crypto makes sense. Crypto to crypto should not qualify as like kind exchange.

Where are people getting this false information that crypto to crypto is not taxable?... it is taxable. Report it on your taxes.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:27:26
This doesn't cover forks. Just because this doesn't cover forks doesn't mean it's not taxable...

I disagree. Many people here are asking how to get away with tax evasion on their cryptos here every day. Stop being greedy and pay your damn taxes. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:19:12
But does it have lower fees? And is it REALLY faster? And does everyone care about decentralization?
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:34:07
They're still evading taxes but may not be committing tax fraud. Tax avoidance is legally avoiding taxes. Tax evasion is illegally not paying correctly. Tax fraud is intentionally evading. You'll still pay fines for unintentionally evading taxes.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:44:53
You're supposed to pay taxes at the fork for the value of the coin you received at the time of the fork. That is now your tax basis for which you'll pay taxes on when you have a taxable event on the forked coins in the future.
And I am a licensed cpa so I believe that qualifies me to disagree with a poorly written article...
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:05:25
The article is incorrect and very misleading. 
"However, it has never been clear whether a trade between two different cryptocurrencies qualifies as a “like kind exchange.” Up until this point, cryptocurrency trades have typically resided in this legal gray area, granting most traders a loophole for deferring taxes on short-term capital gains."
It has never been a "gray area"... it's a taxable event. Just read up on what a like kind exchange is and what qualifies for the treatment and it's very clear that crypto does not fit the definition. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:28:36
That's a good choice :) 
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:46:02
Where did you and others read this? I'm a cpa and can tell you that crypto to crypto does not qualify for like kind exchange recognition. When you trade crypto to crypto it's a taxable event.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:34:25
I'm not talking out of my ass like you are. You can write the IRS and get their opinion on the matter. It's pretty easy. I can tell you that your position won't hold up if you get audited. Live and learn though.

@_date: 2018-01-11 03:13:36
It was already pretty clear that it was taxable... ask your accountant if you're unsure. And yes the crypto community wasn't treating it as that, but that doesn't mean it is correct. This is why the IRS is cracking down on it. It's still tax evasion and anyone not treating their crypto to crypto as taxable events is evading.

@_date: 2017-12-09 00:53:29
These guys are correct. You can download a summary of your tax gain/loss on Coinbase. They do it for you on a FIFO basis. You also cannot deduct something as a loss because you "lost" it. You're SOL there. Just pay your taxes. You'll get in more shit than what it's worth by being greedy. And with more and more people trying to commit tax fraud through bitcoin, there is a higher chance of the government stepping in.
Side note: if you sell bitcoin, even if you keep the cash in the exchange and buy more, you need to pay tax on your gain at that point.
If you exchange bitcoin for any other crypto, that is also a taxable event. You need to pay a gain on the traded btc. Treat this as selling for usd at that point and subsequently using that usd to buy more crypto.
The amount of false tax information on this subreddit is astonishing and lots of people are committing tax fraud.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:06:18

You can download a report that will tell you your taxable gain on Coinbase. It's done on a FIFO basis. They do it for you. /easy

@_date: 2017-12-15 03:07:13
Omg it's my cake day!
I think you're thinking of it wrong then. You can never have more than 21m bitcoins. All the decimals are doing are chopping it up. If you think of it like a 21tb hard drive then you can never put more than 21tb on it. But you have have 21,000 gb on it. Or you can have 21,000,000 mb on it, or you can have 21,000,000,000kb on it. But in the end, they're all the same thing just represented in smaller fractions of a whole.
Edit: to go further... say the 21tb hard drive costs $100. If you change it into small fractions, a 21,000 gb would also cost $100.
Now let's say that this is a US dollar that can be divid into cents. And let's compare it to say a Canadian dollar. Let's assume that the Canadian dollar is worth 2 US dollars. Now if the us prints double the current us money supply, you would have to give 4 usd for 1 Canadian dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:21:24
Sounds like you're asking if you can get away with evading taxes. You're not "good"... I'd need more information to determine if you owe anything. Just pull up turbo tax next month and spend 20 min filling it out and see if you owe anything. You will need to report the transactions from new egg. Unless you have other sources of income it likely won't matter but don't evade paying taxes...
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:27:31
Ah That's good news. I'll have to read up on it in a bit. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:35:12
I'll explain for you...
Assuming you bought the $20 of BTC when BTC was $4k... you would have to report $10 of short term capital gain on your taxes as the price of btc has doubled.
Think of it as a sale of your btc and then a subsequent purchase of the meal.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:00:53

Not sure why you're getting downvoted... people here need to stop being so greedy and stop thinking there is genius way to avoid paying taxes on their astronomical gains. The IRS will get their money in the end. The taxes for bitcoin are pretty straightforward. Pay it and enjoy the gains without having to worry about the IRS coming at you later in life when you may not have the cash to pay later.

I'm an accountant and will tell you that accountant guy is wrong. Nevyn is correct.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:19:57
Accountant here. You cannot do that. You pay capital gains tax on a per coin (or fraction of) basis. If you bought 1 coin for $500 and it went up to $1000 and you pulled out your original $500 then you'd have a capital gain of $250.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:28:06
Yes selling them is a taxable event. Doesn't have to hit your bank account. Coinbase tracks it for you if you don't want to do it manually. Just go to Coinbase and download the tax info

@_date: 2017-12-22 04:57:47
It's true, this could be a factor. Tax returns in Q1 also could play a factor in it going back up. Those are just a couple factors out of many.

Have to pay tax on that
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:14:30
Also, it doesn't matter how you divide it up, you aren't creating more... you could divide bitcoin infinitely and it wouldn't be creating more. That's how fractions work. 
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:01:10
And his point still stands...
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:22:47
Right it would have to be an identical coin for it to be an exact split. So the current value of BTC is $7050 usd. There are futures trading for segwit2x coin already. So assume the value of the segwit2x coin is $1200 usd.
At the time of the fork (if it were to happen right now) you could expect the value of btc to drop to around $5850 (7050-1200).
Keep in mind though that these values will change all the way up until the fork. And after the fork anything can happen. This is just an example of what will happen AT the fork and how segwit2x's value is currently priced into BTC. There is no "free coin"
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:29:06
Banks give loans to make money on the interest... they're happy about the loan as long as he is making his payments and if bitcoin goes up he will be able to do that. And your argument of "good luck getting your crypto" is a point towards banks not becoming obsolete due to crypto. And there's always prison.

Are you talking about BCH or the recent bitcoin gold fork? If you kept up with the price through that fork, the price of BTC dropped around the value of the bitcoin gold value. Yes, it did shoot up shortly after, but this could be attributed otherr things including segwit2x. The point of it is... immediately at the fork it should drop around the value of B2x. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:57:55
When did I complain about high transaction fees? And the IRS doesn't care. Again you don't know what a psychopath is. Take my advice and pay your taxes. And just a little more education, the IRS doesn't have to even see your transactions to find out you're evading taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:37:28
Yeah he's clueless. He's going to learn the hard way though. And it's incredible to me that he didn't realize Coinbase tracks your transactions. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:10:42
It won't split in half. But the value of segwit2x is currently priced into bitcoin. The current bitcoin's value is the value of both coins. At the time of the fork, expect bitcoin's value to drop in the amount equal to the value of segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:53:41

Sure bitcoin is anti bank . But there's a lot of people that likely won't get into crypto until there is a bank. I think if bitcoin continues to grow we will see bitcoin banks pop up. Not everyone wants to be holding all of their btc themselves and I think some people need the banks to have a higher sense of security.
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:12:06
No, it just makes zero sense to you.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:03:32
There is no free coin. You're really buying both coins when you're buying btc as the 2x coin's value is built into the value of btc. A lot of people don't understand this and believe they're getting free money by buying before the fork. They're not.
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:53:17
You think the IRS is going to listen to whatever "the news" says?...
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:08:22
Why did they not approve it? I just made a deposit with chase yesterday and am curious now if it will go through.
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:16:21
It will dip immediately at the fork
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:02:15
It's not free (nothing ever is). It's already priced into the current price of bitcoin. Look at the futures of BT2. Last I checked they were around $800. Post split you should expect a decrease of BTC equal to the price of BT2. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:08:53
It's impossible to know what the best option is. I have my own belief on what will happen but in the long run I think bitcoin will go up. Short term no telling.

People here are about as biased as you will get towards bitcoin. It's really not a good idea to go off investing advice from Reddit. You can read other subreddits and dig into the details of why they recommend what they recommend. But in the end you should make your own decision. That said, it's really not a good idea to put so much into bitcoin as bitcoin is considered a high risk (I do believe it will continue to go up). Choosing individual stocks like AMD though is also not really diversifying much. Since you're starting a job soon be sure to take advantage of 401k for employer matches and it will also help with diversification. Then invest in btc. You're young so it's good to take risks but don't risk your whole savings on one thing (AMD or bitcoin). 
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:58:13
That's what I'm saying. And if anyone wants the IRS' opinion you can contact them prior to filing your taxes.
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:11:27
And again, money doesn't even have to be in the bank for them to catch you. Do some research on different methods of identifying tax evasion. It's pretty eye opening.
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:38:00
Hate to break it to you but unless you're making peasant dollars (you probably are) from bitcoin, you can get caught pretty easily for tax evasion.
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:56:38
