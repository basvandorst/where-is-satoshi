Here in Brazil there is a company that makes arbitrage on crypto exchanges. You can invest using BTC and you will receive monthly a little more BTC. They were preparing themselves to launch globally, but I'm don't know if they really did.
(I know the premise looks really like a ponzi scheme, but they never promised ridiculous return, neither forced people getting more people into)

I made an international transfer last month. It took 3 business day and I've been charged almost 14%
Source bank fee + destination bank fee + government fee. Absolutely ridiculous.

Depends on how you do that. If you're in an exchange, less likely.
