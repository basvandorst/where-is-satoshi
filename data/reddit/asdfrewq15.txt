Bank transfers = higher chance of losing money while you wait for your coins
If instant credit-crypto transfers go away I'll probably be done with bitcoin

Nah they closed it 'because it's fraud and didn't catch onto main stream' is their reasoning
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:28:46
AKA "we're trying to kill the competition"
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:53:56
Some people do use bitcoin to purchase things
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:33:54
If the bitcoin takes 5-7 days to actually reach my account and in those 5-7 days the value of bitcoin goes down, I've now lost money
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:41:45
I have so many acquaintances who refer to themselves as "investors" now because they put $100~ dollars in bitcoin when it was at 10K lmao

Stop letting people piss in your cheerios
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:58:00
They stopped allowing any crpyto purchases like 2 weeks ago.  Just found out today when I called them.  I'm fuming right now

This is how I feel about shopping locally. Why should I pay more when it's their fault for not getting with the times. Online shopping is in every way better than shopping locally.
I agree with the sentiment, but I'm not wasting money just to feel good

Neat. This should be a fun little winter break project. Thanks for the info!

Sometimes when life is going too well I look through my transaction history on electrum from a couple years back to even things out
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:05:52
I mean there have been tiny crashes here and there like when Bitcoin broke over 10k
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:30:54
I would if it wouldn't cost me 30+ extra dollars to send you Bitcoin for it
Is there an api I can grab?
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:35:41
I'd hope so
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:44:13
There's a lot too it but the general event that happened is all these people had all their money in the stock market and then the stock market crashed and everyone's money was worthless
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:33:21
That's literally how the great depression happened lol

Edit: for some reason block chain gave me the rejected error, and now it's trying to confirm again. I have no clue what the fuck is going on.
Somehow it's getting fucking rebroadcasted every time the mempool drops it.
Edit2: 
@_date: 2017-05-05 01:47:44
Is there a visual tutorial for this?
@_date: 2018-04-30 05:50:57
Having grew up in Maryland this is pretty normal atire

Electrum, I used dynamic fees so I had no control over it. All year I've never had an issue with dynamic fees and my slider is all the way to the right.  All my transactions are generally confirmed in less than an hour.  This is the first time I've had issues.  
I know the fees too small. 
I just don't see why it keeps getting rebroadcasted by the mempool when the address is no longer accepting bitcoins, and the fee is too low. I can understand a day or two, but not 5.
@_date: 2017-05-04 07:15:10
Nope, going on day 4 now. Shits infuriating. This is the type of stuff that will kill this currency fast.
@_date: 2017-05-05 01:35:11
Electrum, though cpfp isn't working for me
@_date: 2017-05-05 02:46:49
Oh wow, litterally the minute I opened up electrum I got my coins back haha, I've been bout bashing my head in these past several days with this
thanks for the help
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:06:26
fees are getting insane.  Hopefully the market doesn't stay like this.
@_date: 2017-05-08 22:51:09
Where can I find your address? I got like 2 bucks in bitcoins I don't want
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:17:44
I'm not sure that goes beyond my knowledge of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-03 18:23:12
I did that, still didn't work
On  It's still unconfirmed....
@_date: 2017-05-03 17:27:44
That may be it.
@_date: 2017-05-05 01:54:16
 This is what happens when I try and run it by itself
