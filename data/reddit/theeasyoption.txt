A 25% loss on something this volatile isn't that bad, especially if its an amount you're comfortable holding until it goes up again.

This is people cashing out on their massive gains. Perfect time to buy because everyone who holds it now, either A)   has been holding for a while or B) will only lose money or break even by selling

Coinbase for buying BTC and then select a website to transfer BTC to for buying smaller cryptos. I use Kucoin. It's pretty good.
or you can just hodl BTC

When Munger was asked why Goldman was making a trading desk for crypto if he thought it was worthless and he said "they (bank managers) have more animalistic tendencies" and then stared at the ground quietly for 5 seconds; That's when I thought he was dealing mainly in emotions.
Obviously Goldman is betting on crypto trading volume being large enough for them to make a significant amount of money. Munger knows it

Except it's about a 1.5% drop over a week compared to about a 25% over a week

Many problems with your analysis. 
1-that Goldman Sachs is going to invest millions in developing a platform that they dont think will be viable long term.
2-that Goldman needs to make a crypto platform to keep their daytraders busy and making money
3-That Goldman is going to train or hire people for crypto trading (even though they dont think its long term?)
4-That Goldman making a trading platform is not to make money on the transaction fees from their customers trading each other but rather that they are making it to trade against us? see above example 2 and 3.
It's pretty obvious that they are making a platform as a long term strategy. It takes a lot of money to make one, train people on the platform and the industry, and to day trade. They simply WOULD NOT do it if they thought crypto was doomed or if the volume wasn't there in 18 months.

Buffet is a salesman as much as an investor. His dad was a senator and he got a lot of people to give him money to invest for them pretty early. You can be a shit trader and have people give you millions annually and make 8% annually, skim 1% in management fees over 40 years and be Warren Buffet rich. Good luck getting people to give you millions to invest, make 8%, and know how to keep it all above board. That's the real game. It isn't about being an oracle.
I agree with what you said. I'm just adding to it.

I can't read the whole article, but I thought the manipulation was when BTC was between 4000-12000. Was it all the way to 20,000?
Also, I think manipulationis a strong word. They were buying and selling at strategic times. Everyone tries do do that

They can request to be paid in crypto or buy it through other means. I feel like I've heard that a cell phone data crypto was being used as a barter type currency. There are probably a lot of ways that you could use it. It sounds odd to use it, but it's at least an option for them.
