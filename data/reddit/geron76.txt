Institutional investors want regulation as it’s what makes a marketplace safe. Lack of clear regulations is exactly why they are not all in.  Regulation is not always a bad thing.

Agreed. I remember sometime around the mid to late 90’s telling my friend who was a hifi stereo salesman that one day the radio, computer, the TV and the phone we’re going to be one device in the coming years. He pretty much laughed in my face saying it was impossible.

I Don’t think the world will rebound after ww3 as it did after ww2 if it were fought today. A few flashes of light and anyone left alive will be living in the Stone Age. Good luck spending anything stored digitally.

Seriously lmao. AOL started mostly as a walled garden they went out of there way to keep users within it. Yes you could use the internet but they went out of there way to keep users on their content. If we’re comparing early internet providers AOL most definitely was a shit coin.

AOL walled garden internet was a shit coin.
