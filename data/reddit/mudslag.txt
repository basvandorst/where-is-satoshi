For everyone bought is one sold. I used to see this all the time in the S&amp;P and Naz pits at the CME. Someone would come in and buy up a 2k, 3k, 5k lot looking to uptick it, only to have it drop a handle or two before they could unload their positions. The trader I worked for did this on more then a few occasions. I understand there is a finite amount and as such buying this amount of size appears more as a demand position. But as BTC grows, so do the amount speculators looking for quick gains. And given the finite amount, those who can afford risk will look for the opportunity for smaller but quicker gains.

So gmail gets hacked and coinbase gets the blame, how does that make any sense? 
@_date: 2014-07-03 07:22:53
I honestly dont see how the US could ban bitcoins. They can't ban you from selling your car for another car or even groceries. You can pretty much sell anything for anything else, short of a human being. I could see legal action against the gov in the form of 1st Amendment Rights being a valid argument for the use of cryptocurrency. I know other nations have or talked about it but similar arguments don't usually hold up here. I could see some in Washington "try" to ban it but I truly don't see it ever going through.

Can't to many exchanges be dangerous to both the bitcoin community and the value of bitcoins overall? 
It seems that some exchanges react to other's movements. In a worst case scenario, couldn't an exchange be hacked or even worse, attempt price manipulation in an effort to raise or lower the value of a coin possibly causing a domino effect with other exchanges?

So "in theory" could someone pull a "Joker" move and get a pool up to 51% to purposely centralize the market and theoretically destroy it?

If you just use the app and they have your gmail info, they can just install the app on their own device to get the auth codes for the coinbase auth. I would bet some people keep their personal info in their gmail accounts which could provide the rest of the log in info needed.
