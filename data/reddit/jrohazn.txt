Oh shut up, stop spreading this stupid shit. We all know this was a bubble. Been saying this since 15k.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:13:11
good luck hodling that btc you're holding when you bought the dip, as it reaches prices a shit ton lower than what it is now.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:13:15
Too bad 90% of those people bought all-in lololol
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:52:38
Come again? Dumbass. Hope you’re still holding ;)
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:49:57
Yeah keep saying that when it pops.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:42:20
“Major Correction.” Lol.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:40:15
You invested into bitcoin and the whole school is judging you? Exaggerated much? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:43:05
How is a fluctuation of 7k considered a support? Jesus lmao
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:51:26
How would I know? No one knows.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:28:40
This. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:42:05
Lmao okay.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:28:22
Bad. It’s bad for everything.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:19:45
Shit post
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:20:04
It’s speculation. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:58:00
Like they care
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:32:43
No if Btc crashes like it did back several months ago during the Chinese ban, Alts will continue bleeding. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:18:47
Dude chill out. How are you gonna say he’s not a good resource when you didn’t even watch the video, or even yet: you don’t even know who this guy is? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:26:31
This is OP.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:53:03
Sorry buddy, but if the darknet market got shut down, you have absolutely no way of getting them back.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:42:58
Get some more then. It’s obviously not enough.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:20:33
So 1 month is long enough? ��
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:26:58
99% of this community is invested in Bitcoin solely to get a little richer, they do not care nor understand the technology behind it. With Bitcoin’s issues with scalability, and it’s volatility - there’s no way that it’s going to be accepted as an alternative currency. Like even hypothetically it is, who and how would you even differentiate how much ‘one satoshi’ or ‘ten satoshis’ in price? And I can tell this is a bubble (obviously don’t know how big) cause ghetto teenagers in a SNEAKER group that I’m in are all asking about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:10:34
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:07:31
You are dumb as fuck. For you idiots saying she’s in for the money, you’re dumber than OP here.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:21:27
People here tend to get defensive when others like you try to make an honest discussion. I got in this when it was $2000 and I recently cashed out. This is a textbook-definition of a bubble. It’ll be funny when it drops and people here are panicking. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:41:20
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:35:50
Yet, it hasn’t had a correction since 10k and you’re saying this is healthy. Good luck for all y’all when you lose your life savings.
@_date: 2018-09-19 00:28:50
Post a pic of your car then. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 18:45:56
Bruh you’re retarded. Shut up.
@_date: 2018-09-23 03:38:58
Are you 12?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:20:36
No I said it’s going to pop, but I don’t know when. You’re not very smart, are you?
@_date: 2018-08-21 07:31:53
Still doesn’t mean it’s phishing. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:07:49
For unlimited circle jerks, r/Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-02 10:03:07
Wtf are u smoking?
@_date: 2018-05-05 21:33:16
And you do? 99% of people on here don’t have an idea of how bitcoin works, so don’t kid yourself.
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:08:34
What? no? There's no hard fork coming until November. It's just suggested to get your coins off exchanges, because they can be hacked and you can lose all your coins. Mt. Gox, I'm looking at you.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:07:43
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:22:59
You’re dumb as hell.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:42:50
Keep telling yourself that. Everyone thinks they’re smart until that big red dildo appears. Go read up on what causes a bubble, buddy. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:46:16
Lmao okay. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:43:06
Speculation and FOMO.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:33:33
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:14:36
Wtf are you smoking buddy? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:03:51
And why is that? Lol
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:07:20
I feel so bad for you but at the same time, it’s pretty funny lmao. I’m losing money too bud. You should have learned one lesson - don’t invest what you’re not willing to lose

@_date: 2017-09-05 02:08:57
A trading group
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:08:14
Check bittrex and binance. Most exchanges will follow suit. I have a group
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:31:27
There's been a whale dump, and it'll go to around $3600.
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:16:31
Nah sorry. You can easily find some if you search
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:52:40
I look on track to be right ;)
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:59:43
Jesus this sub is getting dumber by the day.
@_date: 2018-07-27 02:30:07
Wtf? That statement makes you look so ignorant.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:44:47
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH fuck you
@_date: 2018-07-28 07:38:34
Shit post.
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:01:46
You want to change the pricing name relevant to what it’s pegged to: the USD, how ironic. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:06:19
Lmao what a pussy

Took me7 hours
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:56:43
It's been more than 10 minutes? Should I be worried?
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:05:29
It's been 3 1/2 hours for me with 0 confirmations. Face palm 
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:35:08
Uh that's not what I meant lmao. I meant what the chart means 
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:22:23
What does it mean?
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:50:29
Correlation doesn't equal causation.
