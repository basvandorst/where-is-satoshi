But does crypto offer much in terms of uncorrelated returns to make this true? I buy it in theory but thought correlation with other major asset classes like equities was shifting from slightly negative to slightly positive.  I don’t know what big institutions would need to see to 1) believe this is a unique asset class and 2) start shifting part of their portfolio into it. Truthfully, I thought this was the thesis that kicked off the last bull run but not sure the institutional money ever really showed up.

I think I’ll have to supplement a few Xmas gifts with a link to this post. Thank you! ��

Did you withdraw and take the early withholding penalty to get into BTC?

Been loading up all weekend.  Wish I had more to spend. Pretty much used up all my dry powder so if it drops to sub 5k I’ll be bummed I didn’t save some.  But got to strike when the iron is hot.

Relax. Digital currencies are here to stay and Bitcoin core has the name recognition and market cap alone to attract serious institutional money when they start asset allocating fractions of a dump truck of liquidity in search of yield and uncorrelated returns. Sit back, stop watching the price, and look again in 6mths. Don’t trade. Buy and hold. And don’t invest what you can’t handle losing.

No bueno. This is how we get a bubble that collapses and sets back crypto from broader adoption. Lots of people long coins with borrowed money = more panic sellers in a correction that turns into a total rout.
Congrats on the gains though!
