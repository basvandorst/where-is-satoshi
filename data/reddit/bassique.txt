Blockchain bloat was actually on of the bigger issues for ring-signature implementations with regards to scalability imo. Good to hear that a new proposal has been made. 
But won't it need a lot of peer-review and testing before implementation?

It's the BITmobile!

Guys, we're talking 1 million USD a week, this is 1.000 bitcoins...

This is the killer implementation right here. Too bad this can't be developed for WhatsApp.

Pretty lame attempt mimicking the Onion iyam. Not really clever/funny, just naggy. Don't like it and I can't see this being good for Bitcoin either.

Congratulations on your (very deserved) win. We had a lot of fun coding alongside with you.

No, that won't work in this case. The second those coins move, everyone here will go apeshit.

This was the press release I found. Thought it sounded very sketchy and found the CCN-link provided above. 
Hopefully people don't fall for this. It should immediately tingle your scamsenses

Man, wish there was a cryptographically sound altern.
On which could be truly relied.
Never worry about privacy nor fungability.
Established all at the protocol level.
Rather than using a fully transparant ledger.
Oh, that is something the world really would need.

Ah I couldn't find it myself. Thanks, good job!

"Mentor Monday" is a better way of putting it, good job :)

Yeah nice tool. Here's an interview from 2 of the 3 creators of the service explaining some of the workings:

How can one not own at least a fraction of a bitcoin having read this article? 
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:28:12
Nice edit you did there! Is this even allowed?

Does this include the non-bitcoin codebases, like Ethereum or Cryptonote? 
  
Considering Gemini is fully regulated and (partly) focussed on institutional clients, is there any chance to serve as an exchange for privacy centered crypto-currencies? Ie zero cash (if ever) or Monero?
