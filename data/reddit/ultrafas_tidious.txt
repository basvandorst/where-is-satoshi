Carlin would barf on the idea of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin IS stupid and HAS no chance. Maybe you are referring to Austrian economics at the time of The Third Reich.

I'd pick Michael Corleone over Crypto-Neckbeard-Basement Dweller-Lambo Fanboys every time. That guy has class.

Economics is about human nature really. It should apply to crypto, if you understand it enough

It makes me angry to see people spread ignorance with extra smugness

Yeah! Shady is the norm! Am I right fellas?

Of course, Crypto is snake oil trading

Paul Krugman's right, maybe you should go train some more before calling yourself an economist.

Sadly regulating a 7 tx/s monetary exchange system with a short circuit power consumption is a waste of everyone's time.

Nah, it's not that wall street doesnt know, they dont care. They know the government would bail them out, and the goverment is full of paid bankers looking to get rich themselves. It's financial politics, still they are naturally human and very rational.
If you want to see the highest level of economics in action look up game theory, in that sense you'll see how even the irrational aspect of human behavior is rational if you dig deep enough.

Doesn't even reach usage saturation after 9 years and only 7 tx/s limit, it's time for the Ponzi to end. Learn your 9th grade physics to understand what I mean by a short circuit power consumption. I'm having too much fun reading funny schadenfreude contents on this sub, my time is well spent.
