I actually posted a few charts today in the morning before Bitcoin crashed and there was some interesting things that i saw and I talked that if it did tank would go to $150 area -- that's around where it tanked too. 
Check my full analysis &amp; notes here: I don't own any bitcoins but i find it very intriguing and interesting   I got some flack from a Bitcoin guy but didn't hear from him after it crashed down. I think smart money may have been buying that today but we'll have to see over time or at very least the overseas market (china/russia etc. ) to see if they buy at these levels-- currently its 176.70 BTCUSD -- not sure what that is in Euros
I posted a chart at 10pmEST here:April 10th after the drop /bounce  
I posted on twitter that with today's bitcoin crash , I  feel most sorry for SilkRoad drug buyers in a/m =lazy ones that slept in got 40% off on ecstasy.
It figures,  lazy drug buyers get the best deals..lol 
Enjoy the information - let me know if you find the analysis helpful
