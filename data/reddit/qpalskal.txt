By legalize they mean that you a) tell the government how much BTC you have and b) pay tax. That doesn't seem too bad until you consider it breaks THE fundamental tenet of personal safety... never tell anyone how much bitcoin you have (especially a group of strangers (especially a group of strangers help bent on gaining power and control over other people)). For example, paying tax on a BCH -&gt; BTC trade is equivalent to telling a group of total strangers precisely how much bitcoin you have and how much you'd likely pay for your oldest child to keep their fingers and toes. Legalization isn't about helping you. It's about controlling you. The government are strangers. Stranger danger. You learned this in kindergarten. It feels strange to apply this knowledge in adult life because you've never actually held anything of value before, for yourself, with all the risks and consequences. Big brother has always been there for you, lifting from your shoulders the full burden of ownership. Youve never truely owned a thing of value. Now you do, and you must decide whether to truely own it or to give it away. You cannot do both. If you try to keep it safe while also leaking how much you have, you will be harmed.

Coinbase is for new users. New users must trade fiat for bitcoin as they can not yet trade bitcoin for fiat. Thus this.
