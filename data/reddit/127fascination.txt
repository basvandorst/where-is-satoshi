Those companies need to lower content prices and change distribution methods.  I would gladly pay $5 for a movie on opening night if it was streamable.  Under the current model they get nothing from me and  other countless millions.

Who are they buying this BTC from, what are they sellers getting in return?
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:18:22
Correct, you would collect a small fee.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:26:47
Yes, need to wait about 10-20 minutes for lock-in.  Once it's locked in the channel needs to become public also, for me it was another 15 minutes.. You can check by doing a
cli/lightning-cli listchannels |grep "your id"
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:01:50
@_date: 2018-01-25 04:00:45
Why? That irc  channel is super useful 
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:12:16
The amount of BTC you fund your channel with is the amount you can spend at other LN nodes.  It is also the amount that other nodes can route through your node. For example, I'm currently connected to Blockstreams node, another node who does not have a connection to Blockstream can route a payment to them automatically and anonymously through my node.  DO NOT fund your channel with more than a few bucks worth of satoshis.....

Additionally, note that we do not "own" the BTC that goes into the ether sale.
