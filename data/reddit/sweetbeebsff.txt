at least 7 maybe even upwards of 10+

Now imagine if some genius created an exchange that accepts every type of currency and you can buy every type of crypto and receive your coins instantly!

Thats a no for me dog

I'm more interested in making somewhat of a quick buck if you will. I think I can flip this $1,000 between now and 2018 for a decent profit, GDAX is the way to go then? Is GDAX INSTANT buy and selling?
For example: I legit was watching it dip to 14,600 usd this morning, and knew it was going to go back up but I hesitated buying because it was on coinbase and the price didnt update as fast and before I knew it, BTC was back up to 15,400
If I was on GDAX could I have bought in at $14,600 and sold for $15,400 within minutes? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:37:16
so I would need to wait up to 3 days before I could really trade? or fiat balance could be instant? I'm not sure what a fiat balance is 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:28:33
Its fairly normal for it to go down during the night
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:34:53
Is a limit order the price in USD? or BTC? Like if I bought $1,000 worth at say $14,600 and it spikes to $15,400 and I want to take what profit I made in that (Not sure how much it would be lol) and run and then wait for another dip and rinse and repeat? Could it be an endless cycle of like $60 profit here and there or what?
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:56:45
I've been waiting on mine for 3 days now on coinbase, although it was a purchase of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:25:54
Oh man this is really insightful, thanks for your help!
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:49:09
It has name brand value like Starbucks and that will always have success in my mind
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:35:20
Its just getting around to the general public that arent online
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:22:34
can you buy and sell BTC immediately on GDAX? Why would one use CoinBase instead if so?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:53:21
YOU HAVE TO HOLD BROTHER
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:32:18
This is how I feel, if you want in a pretty good price vs 10 days from now, you need to buy buy buy!
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:27:01
I would like this answer as well, in my mind I get my BTC right away and can hold or sell if I please and they will take the $1,000 or w/e you pay no matter what?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:46:04
Hold brother, its going to fluctuate alot before the next big boom. anything under $20,000 could look like a steal by New Years for all we know..
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:25:03
can one even buy say $1,000 USD of bitcoin on CoinBase right now?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:09:05
Dude its gone up and down so much that its not even really dropping when it does, every time it goes down say 500-800 it gets back up over it to 1000-1500
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:18:08
I see the opposite happening, I think we see it keep rising and the Correction has been happening ever since 19k and were at a steady $16k give or take
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:29:01
So if I buy $1,000 USD on GDAX at what I think is a "low point" do I immediately own (if my math is right) around 0.06 BTC and they take my $1,000 immediately? Or do I sit in a Limbo if you will at whatever the cost was when I tried to get it and go from there once they have my $1,000? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:00:33
If my math and guessing of the price is correct then that $5 tip 4 years ago is now worth around $1,000 but without the wallet address or have having saved it you're going to need to find it
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:31:51
Plot twist, thats you
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:12:04
If you're ganna make this post at least have the decency to let us know in BTC...
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:27:18

Yea mine is 1-24 hours, but when I buy BTC say at $14,600 but my money has to transfer and it takes 24hrs and 24 hours later BTC is now 16,000. Do I get all that profit or am I starting from $16,000? Thanks for all your help
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:45:36
I'm holding at least until Christmas no matter what happens in the next couple days
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:35:08
If you're using Coinbase it can take up to 7 days...
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:43:27
I just put $1,000 into BTC legit just now, holding on for this wild ride
If I somehow double my money I'll be ecstatic 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:43:58
my wallet is 6969
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:33:02
$500 USD worth of BTC. I clicked on "exchange" found "btc" clicked "deposit" and copied that address into GDAX and sent. I have no record anywhere but GDAX of sending for some reason 
edit: Oh shit for some reason its the same address again and I can see it on blockchain!
edit2: Its showing up on Binance now! thanks for the comfort lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:39:52
Hey thanks for sending me 12 BTC too, can you send me 12 more I gave it to a homeless guy on a corner with a USB drive and said "You know what to do with it" he has no idea he has 180k in BTC atm, GOT EM
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:45:10
yes and I dipped in and out perfectly, go me
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:49:41
give me the number and I'll let you know Kappa
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:34:10
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:02:22
I don't think so, people were buying it like wild fire at 18k when it was rising so fast to 19k before the 3k crash, I think holding is the best thing to do and let everyone freak out
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:34:55
I'll help you get them if they are actually yours for 5BTC
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:50:32
5k is now what?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:38:47
Why not add your bank on CoinBase? much easier withdrawal and deposits
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:43:20
cool thanks for your help!
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:42:38
You put in a buy order at a certain price and thats what you paid for the BTC no matter what happens legit 10 seconds later you own BTC at x price you paid. Now you kind of have to sit in a "limbo" if you didnt get the funds added right away and who knows what the market will look like 7 days from know, it basically forces you to hold
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:21:20
Say you buy a full bitcoin at a low point of $14,000 USD today. When you go to confirm on CoinBase it list the price that you're buying it for at the time with a message saying "Funds will be debited today or within 3 business days" I assume you get your 1 bitcoin right away and can start making money instantly, correct me if I'm wrong or if I sound like a moron
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:15:03
I just bought $1,000 worth with coinbase legit 10m ago when it dipped to 14.6k
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:58:03
where can I get a personal wallet from? Could I just keep my money on GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:11:47
Cant you also use your paypal to get it quicker? Thru CoinBase that is
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:23:30
I like where your heads at
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:02:19
Like this Sunday close? PogChamp
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:14:46
Ok sent you 1.3 BTC
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:53:12
This is the "correction" everyone was talking about
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:49:16
I'm still in the green and I'll buy more if it dips into the mid 15,000s 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:51:40
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:48:19
Then is Litecoin Facebook? Hmmmm :thinking:
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:04:15
If BTC hits 50k Ill Suck my owner peter and swallow
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:47:07
I did not use debit
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:46:19
Okay so I'm put into a "limbo" of holding until they receive my payment unless I use GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:12:09
you could help out a new guy tryna make his first profit off BTC a Christmas gift!
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:30:25
Do I get put in a "Limbo" if you will? What happens if they don't take my $1,000 right away? Am I free to sell when I want? or do they have to have my money first and if it takes 3 days what happens between the price I buy and the price in 3 days?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:45:06
So no matter what happens in that week, I own that BTC at what price I paid basically instantly and can start either losing or gaining money right away essentially?
