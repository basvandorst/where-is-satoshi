6 is used as the shared secret key, which can be used with their choice of encryption protocol.  This doesn't actually cover encryption, just agreeing upon a key.
 
Imagine it like this - I'm sure in school you used the Caesar cipher or something like that to send secret messages to friends.  In order for your friend to read what you wrote they needed to know the code word to decrypt it.   But imagine you had no way of securely giving the code word to your friend without someone else reading it.
 
This solves that problem.  You and your friend can come up with a code word (6 in the above example), even if you are passing notes in class through someone who is trying to read them.

Ah, so you want to become a hardware manufacturer like Fon then.  Didn't see that in your writeup, I thought it was more of a protocol thing.
And it'll be really hard to provide connections cheaper than Comcast, by using Comcast as a gateway.  Unless you're just offering tiny ( &lt; 1 mbit ) connections, and not caring at all about customer support (you didn't answer my question about who the customer calls when their Internet goes down)

I like the idea of creating a decentralized market for bandwidth - that seems like a really cool concept.
 
The challenge is that physical infrastructure needs to be implemented, and someone needs to own and maintain that infrastructure.   So unless the market can accomodate compensation (salaries, asset depreciation, etc.) for those that invest in infrastructure, I can't see how the network could be established in a way that would be reliable enough for practical use.

I have about 10 years experience in deploying 802.11a/b/g/n networks of all shapes and sizes, from campus-wide systems to city/county-wide systems.  I've developed open-source polling protocols that replace the 802.11 MAC layer to eliminate hidden node issues that arise from CSMA in long-range deployments.  I know the 802.11 protocol(s) inside and out.
 
There is absolutely no way that home routers acting in a mesh configuration with dynamic routing would ever be able to provide reasonable throughput.  Even if you had a perfect topology of carrier-grade point-to-point microwave dishes with excellent LOS and fresnel clearance, there isn't enough RF bandwidth available in all of the ISM/UNII bands combined to provide decent Internet service (&gt; 1 mbit) to a municipal area by means of a mesh topology.  The density is too high.
 
Even if there were enough RF bandwidth, just think about it - you'll be at the whim of your neighbour's cheapo residential routers.  Pretty sure most nodes on this network will not have UPS battery backup, on-call technicians to replace defective gear, etc.  It will be colossally unreliable, and for what benefit?
**tl;dr** - wireless mesh networking is a pipe dream that doesn't work in practice.

So say I'm Joe Schmoe, a 60 year old welder who is not very computer literate but I like to watch Netflix because they have all my Hogans Heroes reruns.
 
My neighbour Mike knocks on my door and says he'd like to sell me his extra Internet bandwidth for $20/mth and it'll be fast enough for Netflix.  Great!  That's half the cost of Comcast, and I can call him up directly if there's problems (personal service in this day and age? fantastic!).
 
I get the service, and it works great for a few weeks - but once a few more of my neighbours are online with MikeNet, things start to get slow in the evenings.  I call up Mike and say "what gives?  Colonel Klink is all jittery!" - to which Mike responds that he's used up all the bandwidth that Comcast can provide on a cable circuit, but he can't afford the $20,000 to get fibre trenched to his house.
So I do the logical thing, cancel my service with Mike (even though he's a great guy and trying his best) and go back with Comcast.
 
I'm just not buying this as a scalable business model I guess.

If the point of this isn't the wifi mesh network, then what benefit does this protocol offer over BGP?  or Tor?
 
I'm also quite convinced that determining routes will not be the expensive part, it'll be bandwidth utilization over the mesh network itself that will take the most resources.
 
Don't get me wrong, if there were a way to actually accomplish something new and novel here - I'd love to be involved.

What infrastructure?  What data?


 
What are you selling?  Who is buying it, and what does it get them that they don't have already?
 
You say mobile market, you mean iPhones and such?  As in - competing with the cell companies to offer mobile data services?  That can't be done with Wifi on a metro scale without mind-boggling investment in infrastructure.  Wifi is not well-suited to this task at all (good speeds on wifi need -85 dBm signal, good speeds on 3G need -95 dBm - you'd need about five times as many towers as the cell companies have)
 
Not to mention you couldn't support native SMS or phonecalls with your service.

@_date: 2012-06-15 22:46:03
Ah, so we're relying on Comcast's distribution infrastructure to sell a product that competes with Comcast.
 
Even ignoring that, you will need to achieve some sort of blanket coverage right off the bat before any customers are going to start subscribing.  Why would I pay even $5/month if I can only get coverage in some sketchy suburban areas when standing within 50ft of someone's house?  Indoor wireless APs have pretty crummy range, so unless you had tens of thousands of people onboard to resell their Internet, it'd be a difficult sell.
 
This would be akin to FatPort or Bongo, or any of those other hotspot services that you can buy into and resell your Internet connection with.

I think you're right that this concept is missing its equivalent to the "proof of work" that makes the whole thing happen.
 
To be honest, I'm not ever sure it can be done in a decentralized way but I didn't think currency could be done that way before Bitcoin either.
 
Definitely a worthwhile goal to strive towards though.  I'll put some thought into it and post on your subreddit if I have any insights.  Just about to catch a flight so I'm afk for now.
 
Thanks for the interesting discussion.

Roaming across multiple wifi networks (that have different gateways) can be done pretty easily with some extra software - but it means having to gateway everyone at a single point in the cloud, which breaks the whole "decentralized" concept unfortunately.
 
And again, as a service - it would be a hard sell to compete with 3G unless you have these devices in a blanket coverage across the city.  Wifi just isn't designed to do this, and it's really hard to shoehorn it in there due to PHY/MAC layer problems (fair medium access control, minimum SNR for good speeds, etc.)
 
If the clients also had specialized equipment you could do it, but you could hardly call it Wifi at that point (look at Ubiquiti AirMax, or Mikrotik NSTREME for example)
@_date: 2012-06-12 00:26:24
Fascinating idea.  I think the biggest obstacle to widespread use will be the user interface though.  If we're trying to replace debit/credit/cash with this, it'll have to be significantly simplified.
 
Also with all those features I'm a bit worried these things will cost something like $300 apiece.
@_date: 2012-06-15 22:13:24
From a functional standpoint I am still missing a big piece of your plan.
 
Say you want a network that has 3000 clients on it.  They want to be able to use the Internet in the same way that they always have (netflix, hulu, torrents, etc.) and will demand let's say 8 Mbit download speeds.  If they aren't able to use the Internet in a traditional way, what are they paying for that they can't get from Tor?
 
Typical broadband oversubscription ratios say that properly distributed and aggregated, you will see a network demand of about 400 MBit for this number of clients at 8mbit each.  You can't trunk that over wireless without expensive dedicated equipment (although the Ubiquiti AirFiber might change that somewhat)
 
Traditionally an ISP would handle this by buying a fibre optic gateway connection from one of many providers (fibre wholesale gateway is actually far more competitive than retail Internet, there's dozens of providers to choose from).  The ISP then is responsible for maintaining the network ("the last mile"), providing phone support, and sending technicians out in the event of network equipment failure or even problems in the home.
 
If your system is going to replace ISPs - who is getting paid?  who is responsible for ensuring that a customer is getting their full bandwidth at all times?  who is responsible for ensuring that an individual user does not perform denial of service attacks on the system? 
Are you planning on relying on hundreds of users sharing their cable modem service over wifi in order to get the Internet gateway?  Or will some users invest in the ~$20k upfront to get fibre optic gateway, with the hope that they'll see some return on that investment by being paid by the network?
 
I'm only replying because I'm genuinely intrigued by your idea, and I'd like to offer my help in achieving it - but I am not entirely sure what niche your application will fill yet.
@_date: 2012-06-15 22:43:05
So let's look at a scenario:
I have a 10MBit business plan with Comcast, and I pay $100/mth for it.  I set up a carrier-grade wireless access point on my roof (~$1000), and then canvas my neighbours to buy Internet from me for, say, $20/mth for 5MBit.  In order to break even I'll need at least five customers installed (~$100 apiece for the installs, not incl labour), but you can't put 25MBit worth of customer traffic on 10MBit gateway without seeing some serious primetime slowdowns - and people want their Netflix.  
But let's assume you can find a way to resell a small gateway for a profit somehow.  Say your AP goes down.  Do your neighbours have your personal cell number so they can call you to complain?  I mean, they're paying you - so you're responsible to fix it.
 
I think you're assuming that the vast majority of the real world will get onboard with this because it's decentralized and cool, but the real world just cares about getting the most bang for their buck - so you have to offer them something they can't get through a traditional ISP if you want this to take off.

Some remote parts of rural Alberta maybe.  Don't generalize the entire province, most of us live in cities.   I was born and raised in Calgary, and it's a tolerant multicultural cosmopolitan city.
We might pretend to be cowboys for a week each summer as an excuse to get drunk and party, but we're not actually racist rednecks.
 
I'd say rural Saskatchewan has more casual racism.  Even there, I've never met anyone who had guns for self defense.  I know lots of folks with restricted firearms that take them to the range, but nobody I know is paranoid enough to think they'll need to shout their neighbours.

Oh I suppose it depends a lot on what country you're in, and what their mobile data rates are.  I have a fairly cheap 6GB cap on my plan, and I never get close to it.  Mind you I'm mostly on reddit/email and only rarely stream video.  HD video I only stream on my home theatre PC, which has a good sized DOCSIS3 cable connection.
 
When I'm in Hong Kong I can get a prepaid SIM with unlimited 4G data for like $20/month USD.  And yet the Marriott hotel next to the airport will still charge you $20 USD (in addition to your $300 room) to use the wifi (which is buggy and barely 1mbit)
