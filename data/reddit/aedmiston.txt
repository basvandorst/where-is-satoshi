Actually, it's not even close to 15th. It's probably the  bowl in terms of prestige/quality of matchup/ratings.
There were somewhere in the neighborhood of 35 NCAA-sanctioned Bowl Games last year. We're moving to a new system this year, so let me explain how this goes.
There are 6 major bowls (Rose, Sugar, Fiesta, Orange, Cotton, Peach) featuring conference champions and other highly ranked teams. 4 of those bowls are designated "playoff" bowls on a rotating basis, with the winners meeting in an additional National Championship Game held a week later. These bowls all have team payouts in the $10-20MM range, with the naming rights going for probably half that amount. These are the bowls everyone watches, the ones that draw 10.0 ratings.
Past that, you have your 2nd tier bowls (Sun, Capital One, Outback, Copper, Alamo). Most of these games are played on or near New Years. These matchups are mostly 2nd-4th place teams from major conferences. Good games with good teams that people want to watch. Good payouts in the $2-5MM range, naming rights again going for about half that. Most of these will draw a 2.5-5.0 rating.
Then you have your junk bowls. That's the rest of them, St. Pete (former known as Beef O'Brady's) bowl included. These games feature a bunch of 6-6 teams from small conferences with even smaller alumni bases. Payouts are under $1MM. It's a huge success if these draw a 2.0 or better. University of Ohio vs. East Carolina was last year's matchup. It was also played at 12pm on a weekday. Last year the St. Pete bowl didn't even crack a 1.0.
Not a coup at all for bitcoin, probably more of a gamble than anything else.
