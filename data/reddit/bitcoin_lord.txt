Well the stock market keeps hitting all time highs and you still see people throwing their money at it.  Lesson is people with money are not all smart and they will invest in whatever seems like a good bet.  Atm stocks 'look' like that good bet while btc 'looks' like it is failing.

dont know why they downvote you, btce is known to accept dirty funds.
@_date: 2015-01-16 17:11:49
It is solely because of the record breaking USA and Chinese stock markets along with the false impression that both economies are doing well.  New investors think btc is toxic and would rather put their money elsewhere.  But this will soon change when both economies are forced to raise interest rates on debt this year and have ended the huge money pumping programs.  Both actions will dry up credit and people will be looking to btc again as a secure means to store their wealth.

Wow, price is super volatile on bitstamp atm.

Did you forget about Cyprus and Greece?  When their economies were failing hard in the news btc rose more than ever.

Exactly the issue at hand, QE is one of the major things propping the markets.  Ending it will again drop the available credit being loaned out and businesses will suffer.  Add on rising interest rates and now business cannot borrow more money and now they have to pay back what they already borrowed at huge interest.  In the great depression interest rates went all the way to 15%.

If you are poor and need money, then sell a portion.  Otherwise hold while the storm passes over.
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:52:20
Then perhaps you can explain why the price is plummeting when there is nothing but good news on its increasing adoption?  You cannot.  My theory is much more sound.
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:55:37
I was smart and hedged thousands out at $380 when I concluded that the btc market was in freefall as long as the US and Chinese stock markets and economies appeared successful hitting record stock market numbers.  Until those economies implode (which they will starting at the end of this year) you will continue to see btc drop with no support from investors that would have pump their cash into stocks.
For some reason this concept is consistently downvoted on reddit, it is basic economics.
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:52:17
It might, which would be a terrible sign of the economy.  Deflation is a worse situation than inflation when you have a fiat currency system.
@_date: 2014-12-26 16:28:51
When the Feds allow interest rates to rise, that is when I start buying btc again.  I give it another year before the curtain drops and the stock market collapses along with quickly rising interest rates on debt.  I unfortunately see btc continuing stagnation/slow decline until then.  But like OP said it is just a matter of time, and I agree that time is short and the changeover will be insanely fast, maybe even a faster increase than the previous runup.
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:40:11
This will be the first year interest rates rise, which will be enough to push the boulder over the hill.  We are on a runup of debt like no other and now Obama and Congress have signed onto insuring derivatives, meaning basically the Feds will be bailing out more AIG situations without any roadblocks and you the taxpayer will have to fit the bill when ANY large financial institution messes up a futures or hedge to the cost of billions.
Also too as mjneat shows QE is ending so now available credit will dry up along with higher payments on already owned debt.  It is all a designed recipe for economic disaster.  Remember what certain people in our government say, "Never waste a crisis."
I am the one talking sense here.
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:03:33
I can't wait til the end of the year when interest rates are forced to rise and economies around the world begin to tank like cyprus, then you will see all eyes on btc.
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:49:25
Rising interest already planned for end of year + End of QE + Feds signing onto insuring ALL derivatives of huge financial institutions = recipe for disaster.

Wrong, there is always logic in markets if you understand human psychology.  If people feel something is toxic they won't invest into it, whether or not it actually is.  As time goes on more and more people will understand the reality of the world's financial mess and choose to put their wealth into btc, but it will probably come in a huge surge snowballing down a mountain and we will see record btc prices again.
@_date: 2015-01-17 14:23:24
Human psychology is not logical lol, but it is predictable.

@_date: 2015-01-13 13:50:20
The Treasury has already stated that rates will have to rise at the end of the year because our debt to other nations has been so long and great that they are pressuring the government to be paid back and raising interest rates is the only way the gov can raise funds other than outright taxation.
Don't know why i got downvoted, redditors are dumb as fuck when it comes to basic economics it seems.

People realizing that the market is going to go way down as the propped up US and chinese economies seemingly thrive.  Don't worry, soon it will be the opposite.  Hang on to your coins as long as you can.
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:08:32
That is no problem, people just realized not to store btc with them.  Price is actually going up again.

Only people freaking are those that put all of their money into btc without leaving any cash in hand for price fluctuation.  Same people will be jumping for joy again when price surges.
