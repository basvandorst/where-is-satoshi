If bitcoin gets big and you invest in the wrong company you are still left with a share of a company with assets, work product and employees, there's the potential for them to re-target a different market. If bitcoin does not become big you are actually left with nothing, the only thing you can do with bitcoin is transact it.


Transactions aren't magic, they require miners and there's tens of millions of dollars in mining revenue per day.

@_date: 2018-01-05 14:34:40


This is incorrect, the tech/protocol is open source and free, you're investing in the network which has value.


yes but why would you invest in it over a company? Owning in a share of a company that deals with crypto would be even more beneficial as the value increases. Like pretend bitcoins becomes the global currency, what you would rather have? 1 bitcoin or part of a company that facilitates bitcoin transactions? which do you think will be worth more.

Go back to 2011-2013 and read what people were saying it was considered fine and how people would pay for things that were low cost instantly(like coffee) i'm sure you can even find examples of a few vendors who accepted 0conf transactions.
It was also pretty hard to replace 0conf transactions so even if a scammer wanted to they wouldn't be able to scam 100% of their targets

It's not a hypothetical game, Bitcoin will almost have to hard fork in the future or it will be useless. It's foolish to pretend otherwise because you have some Petty feud.
If you don't think Bitcoin will ever hard fork then you know it won't succeed. It would be like using only the protocols invented in the 90s because we are never allowed to create new standards.

well you need a transaction to divide bitcoin and that costs money.

Or low numbers of transactions, if the mempool is always empty then no fee transactions can be confirmed
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:06:57
If you think most bitcoin transactions are spam then there are not very many active users, probably around 1  million. 50% of transactions being spam results in 2 transactions per second or an average of about 1 per week for 1.2 million users, at 75 % spam we would be talking about roughly 2 transactions per month.
So are you saying that there's only about 1.2 million bitcoin users? that's a really small number to justify the market cap. Each user adds ~200k to the valuation of bitcoin.

If the speed limit is 20 and someone is going 20 you can't be mad at them, you can only be mad at whoever set the speed limit low.

They don't have to fail to need to pivot. Let me name some companies that pivoted: Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft...


If you are capable of doing a ton of research for bitcoin then you are capable of also doing research on other investments.
See i don't bet i invest, and i *invest* in companies that make profits and grow not just companies that are expected to grow.
You are investing in a thing, the value might go up it might go down but after 100 years you still only have a thing. When you invest in a company you get a basket of things and machines, sometimes the value of the company goes up and sometimes it goes down but it's always producing new things, after 100 years you will have much more than you started with.
So my point still stands, why is currency a better investment than a company?

We use http/2 which was finalized in 2015. there have been 4 versions of http so far. I'm not familiar with packet switched but I'm sure the same applies.
You are also picking examples that aren't limited like Bitcoin. Do you have an example of a data transfer protocol that's limited by size per second that we still use today?
Most protocols are designed so that they automatically scale as bandwidth or processing power scales because otherwise they become obsolete.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:03:06
that's my point. What use does bitcoin have other than as a currency?
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:59:38


It isn't though, bitcoin could change and it's hard to predict things that are 100+ years in the future. Maybe bitcoin will cease to exist, maybe someone will raise the limit. We have no idea, we will have gone through 3+ generations before the cap is hit. Can you even predict what your grand kids or their kids will think and feel?
Currently bitcoin is an inflationary currency, it's supply is increasing every ~10 minutes that's all we do know.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:13:52


every single node operator today will be dead in ~2140, truth be told we have no idea what will happen.


Notice how over the course of an hour i changed your optics, suddenly deflation isn't part of the primary use case.
Well this can continue to happen, optics and goals change, maybe one day bitcoin won't be as censorship resistant or maybe it will become more like a currency and less like a store of value.
This is why it's crucial to remember what people think and notice how our optics of things change over time. otherwise bitcoin might suddenly become not bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:32:59
yes but a channel needs funds for transactions, you cannot add new funds to a channel you can only transact it back and forth.
the network works by having two parties that want to perform a transaction connected via intermediate nodes.
let's pretend Alice wants to send Bob 0.1 BTC over lightning but alice is not directly connected to Bob. Alice is however connected to Mark and has 0.2 bitcoin on her side of the channel, mark also has 0.15 bitcoin on his side of the channel with Bob.
So Alice makes an agreement with mark and bob, she will send mark 0.1 BTC and mark will send bob 0.1 BTC so Alice has given bob 0.2 bitcoin. You will note however that the sum of the BTC on each channel remains unchanged.
But i could be wrong, i'd love to hear how you can transact bitcoin via lightning with 0 on chain transactions
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:41:32
I think you completely misunderstand how lightning works, each channel has 2 sides that transact back and forth. yes once the network has many channels it's possible to quickly move money around but it requires a transaction for each person(or two people) that want to open a channel and join the network.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:35:14
That doesn't invalidate my point. Low/no fee was on of the major advantages for years. This tapered off more recently
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:30:36


it's not an attack, bitcoin supports 3-6 transactions a second currently. that means that at 15 million users each user can just barely do 1 transaction a month.

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:27:54
You are mixing price and utility. It doesn't matter what the price is. The real power is how useful a crypto is. Bitcoin is probably the least useful it's ever been which is shitty since it's also got the most competition
Sure you can make money, if that's what you want wtv. It doesn't really matter if you are paying hundreds of dollars for a transaction when you are making thousands. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:42:37
bitcoin isn't even deflationary yet.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:02:42
The whole point is Bitcoin is slow to improve, look how long it took for segwit to roll out.

And that's why bitcoin will never be a reserve currency, our reserve currencies all handle incredible amounts of transactions. 
Nothing bitcoin does makes it better as a reserve currency.

@_date: 2017-12-27 10:58:43
So ACH is layer 1? That graph shows it doing 100x more transactions than Bitcoin can do in a year.
@_date: 2018-09-26 19:04:15


yeah I'm pretty sure, take bitcoins hard cap on transactions, multiply it by 10 and that's how many cash transactions Canada does each year, a country with a population of 36 million. That's not the cap on cash transactions either, that's just how many are done. It's nowhere near the physical limit.


Probably almost none? Why would different central banks be transacting?  Do you mean a central bank and other banks in the country?


No the argument being made here is "we have a product that solves a different problem with real limitations and it will replace banks". Bitcoin is not going to be a base layer for banks, banks can easily roll out their own blockchain that does the same thing, but also better because they don't need any of the limitations decentralization provides and they would not have to buy into an already expensive system.
@_date: 2018-09-18 12:20:05
It's not even a database, it's a data structure
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:25:41


This takes a on chain transaction and another to close it. it's not free, the channel has to be more useful then the sum of the transaction fees. Each hop in the network will probably take a fee but it would take many transactions for the fees to be worth it.  
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:40:11
But bitcoin isn't unassailable, it's just harder to attack.
And as a product bitcoin is set up to fail when you can't argue why anyone should use it, and that's why it will never be the world reserve currency.
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:18:31
A database is a data structure but that doesn't make all data structures databases. For example log files and arrays are both organized collections of data but we don't consider them databases
I mean you pointed out that the bitcoin blockchain is stored in a database, why would a database need to be stored in another database?
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:17:20


is it? who's using it? doesn't seem like anyone really cares.

The easiest solution is to not use Bitcoin, how does that help anyone?
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:17:05
if 10% of the worlds population used bitcoin each person would get 1 transaction every 3 years and that's excluding and businesses that exist. So how exactly do you think that's going to work as a currency? You can argue 'use LN' but that means that you will have one new LN channel every 3 years, meaning you can't gain wealth.
Bitcoin absolutely fails as a currency and will never be one in its current state.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:44:04


Are you arguing that low fees hasn't been a selling point? just do a search on the sub for remittance


well there's a block reward right now so even with no fees transactions wouldn't be free. Currently more bitcoin is printed each time a transaction is cofirmed.

@_date: 2018-08-14 11:24:38

That's not true though, the Canadian dollar can be used by anyone and is used outside of Canada and if needed it could support the entire world(and more) 


I'm not, I'm showing you why it's a poor currency.


I'm not, I compared VISA to LN to show how lower layer limitations also impact the higher layer.


how many people? Almost the entire world doesn't use bitcoin so that should be a statement of it's utility. 


It is arbitrary, it doesn't scale so as internet speeds have increased it stays the same. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 20:39:11
and yet &gt;1/3 of people don't hold their private keys
@_date: 2018-08-23 16:45:57
All the people who use exchanges aren't holding that bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:39:56


Which is why bitcoin doesn't work as a currency, that's his point.


Does it? LN still has an upper bound on users because of the upper bound on bitcoin transactions. Now compare that to VISA, their upper bound on transactions and users is not attached to the upper bound on USD(or any currency). 
@_date: 2018-08-16 14:29:35
I'm saying that bitcoin is currently useless as a currency. 
You can say that things might get better in the future but that doesn't address the fact now. It also highlights how bitcoin is not the same as other protocols.
For example take a look at popular and widely used protocols, almost all of them are limited by lower level protocols or hardware, not arbitrarily. We don't really define protocols that say "I can only do a arbitrary number of units of work in this amount of time" this is because as you add hardware or improve the speed at which lower level protocols operate the units of work can increase.
So let's look at an example i have data for. Currently Canada has a population of 37 million and that population(and businesses) do 21.6 billion transactions a year or 665 transactions a second. For bitcoin to scale to this it would need to handle 100x more transactions a year. This represents 0.5% of the worlds population, clearly bitcoin is beyond useless as a currency.
Well we can also add LN, so with LN we can now easily handle all these transactions but we need to worry about channels. so if we ignore businesses each user would need at least 1 channel, well users in Canada can open/close channels a total of 6 times each a year. That's not so bad! So assuming that users don't consistently need to either open or close channels we are ok, we can support one half of one percent of the worlds population. So we would also need a 200x increase in performance to support to world.
We can of course compare this to a currency, which doesn't really have a limit on transactions. Or even a bank or banks which are limited only by how fast their systems operate. So currently we are already capable of handling all the transactions the world needs to handle because our current currencies and methods of transferring currencies work well.
@_date: 2018-08-16 18:12:17


0.4 and 4.9 tx/s respectively, it's worth noting i used 7tx/s for my numbers, the reality is it's closer to 3 tx/s
What other protocols create limits on the number of their units of work that can be sent? it's not like TCP limits the number of packets sent per second, that would be insane. The limits are external to the protocol because otherwise you can never scale up. 
If a system can't scale then it can only grow to the max size the network can support. Imagine for example google was limited to 40 million users total, how would that impact the value and success of the company?  
@_date: 2018-10-04 13:27:18

The majority of users don't care about things like segwit and increased block size
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:24:13
It's exactly the same, you claimed that the problem wasn't solved, It was.
You can't just move the goalposts because the solution is different.
@_date: 2018-10-04 13:36:44
It hasn't solved any impossible problems though, it's just an alternate solution to problems we already have solutions for.
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:31:36
No I'm saying bitcoin doesn't solve some previously unsolved problems.

That's a contrived problem, are you thinking of byzantine fault tolerance?
Because that's a problem we dealt with before bitcoin even existed.

I don't have a miner
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:39:30
only if there's no existing invalid data, if there were previous 32MB blocks then the whole chain would be invalid.

moderates often don't voice their opinions, most of the posts here are the loud radicals yelling at each other.
@_date: 2018-10-26 00:06:42
I mean if you don't understand why a company would become more valuable when they stop blatantly lying on their website then I have something for you.
See I'm a very successful investor, if you give me your money I promise it will be backed by Bitcoin. And I'm regularly audited so it's legit.
@_date: 2018-10-25 11:22:09
They have so much to gain by showing they are legitimate
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:35:27
a chain with 8% hash power is not secure.
@_date: 2018-10-16 16:11:09
Bitcoin isn't unique though, for example bitcoin cash is pretty much the exact same.

@_date: 2018-10-25 13:58:27
They claim to be regularly audited yet have never actually been audited. If they are misleading users about that then they could be misleading users about other things.
There's literally no proof that tether is or isn't legitimate and audit would prove legitimacy.
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:39:56
If bitcoin is going to continue to be used it will have to hard fork, the idea that a hard fork cannot be bitcoin is a simplification of the problem. For example bitcoin originally started with a higher block size, we now have a 1MB block size, this was a hard fork(even though it had 0 impact). does this mean that the current bitcoin is not bitcoin? No it doesn't.
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:45:17
long term we still have major scaling issues,
segwit + lightning has increased the potential cap on the number of active users from a hundreds of thousands to &lt;20 million but long term we still need a capacity increase of 100x or more.
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:30:34
That's not what byzantine fault tolerance is though, so i'm not sure what your point is.
And with bitcoin there still is a third party, all the miners, bitcoin is just a way to be very confident that the third party can be trusted.

given that argument though owning stocks is the best option since a company is constantly producing new goods.
if you own 1 bitcoin or $20 you will have the same thing in 20 years. If you own 1% of a company in 20 years you will own 1% of the company but it will have produced 20 years worth of product, research and profits.
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:56:01
Yes the NYA is a signal of intent for segwit 2x.
Bitcoin Cash can't be considered secure with that little hash power, no chain can be.
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:07:36
End users as a who don't have all the power.
For example if all miners shut off could end users still use Bitcoin? No they couldn't.
As a whole users have power but good luck getting all users to agree on something or even care

@_date: 2017-08-02 18:06:05
I've said the exact same thing in regards to that scenario as well. If segwit2x takes 85% of the hash power the segwit chain could potentially be attacked.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:29:57
Which is why I also included lightning.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:33:57
You said your node held your Bitcoin which is false, it's your private key that holds your Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:57:53
Yes it is, a chain with only 8% hash power is not secure
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:51:02
Due to the nature of this subreddit I'm not sure if you are being sarcastic.
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:05:02
Do you know what the word average means?

You need a private key to spend bitcoin, anyone with the private key can spend bitcoin from any node.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:58:28


blocks signalling for segwit are identical to segwit2x blocks at the moment, for all you know every block is being mined by someone who will mine segwit2x blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:46:52
Bitcoin is actually inferior at large scales. for example even with Segwit and Ln the population of the US would be unable to use bitcoin as a currency as they would be limited to 1 transaction per year which translates to 1 segwit channel per 2 years.
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:48:32
increasing the monetary supply isn't the exact same thing as inflation, if buying power is steadily increasing then there could be deflation even as the supply of available coins increases.

to be fair unless we invent some truly groundbreaking solutions block weight will need to increase eventually(although maybe not soon)
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:05:11
As it stands Bitcoin and scaling solutions like lightning don't even scale Bitcoin enough to support 1% of the Earth's current population. 
So yes a hard fork will be needed if Bitcoin is going to be used by a significant portion of the world.
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:04:54

@_date: 2017-08-02 14:58:52
A few years ago there wasn't another coin using the same hashing algorithm that had multiple times the hash power. It's not about the hash power as a number but the hash power as a percentage compared to the total available.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:51:47
Segwit in brings us LN which helps scale.
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:06:46
When you change the PoW you don't know if someone already has a farm that's going to perform an attack, that's a risk.
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:33:10


yes and those can change, that's what a hard or soft fork is. If the vast majority of miners commit to something it's a change that will happen. This is exactly why mining needs to be decentralized. For example if by some miracle bitcoin cash had gotten 92% of the hash power that would be the chain we would be running on now, nothing else could be considered safe.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:42:20
What you are describing is basically a credit card.
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:46:51
it's not the exact same result, one chain is less secure than the other.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:54:30


yes plans with hard limits, what are the plans when we hit those limits?
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:06:08
holding cash is way way better than gambling
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:53:18
If 92% of the miners leave the remaining Network can't be considered secure. No network that's running on the same hashing algo with single digits percentages of hash power can be secure.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:06:05
The only thing you need to hold your bitcoins is a private key not a node.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:28:06
you mean they made the NYA and currently 90-92% of miners are signalling their intent to follow through
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:18:07
Lightning stops scaling at around 15 million people
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:24:34


that's up to the miners to decide, some of them could be dicks and not confirm segwit transactions unless they pay higher fees.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:50:29
if even close to 92% of the miners mine segwit 2x blocks it's the other chain that will be worthless. at 10% hash power the network can't be considered secure.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:59:10
So why do you support segwit? it increases the bandwidth by up to 4x.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:02:20
If segwit2x is inferior that also makes bitcoin inferior.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:02:41
your link shows only 2% of companies oppose 2x, that's a pretty good indication that it will happen.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:37:07


Only if they have routing, I'm not sure what's hard to understand here.
To determine how 2 people can send money to each other when they don't have a direct channel you need to be able to route via other channels, this does not exist yet...
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:06:10
Only thing you need to send Bitcoin is a private key. All records of what addresses have Bitcoin is public.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:47:07
no because you have your private key.
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:57:45


Technically if they see their version of the project as the valid one they aren't risking anything by not having replay.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:34:23
they can still use overt ASICBoost with segwit right?
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:55:00
Their motivation is the agreement they made to appease as many people as possible.

if 92% of miners fork to 2x that will be the chain that has value.

Neither does a third party, there are many anonymous services.
You keep digging to find a problem but there isn't one.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:09:27
segwit2x won't be a minority fork given the hash power signalling for it.
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:22:49
no it's not
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:38:29
segwit also increases block size at this point we don't really have a choice.
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:46:12
And the blockade is currently voting for segwit2x
@_date: 2018-10-26 00:41:00


They've had exactly 0 audits
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:17:21
they are virtually identical in function
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:09:12
that liberation would be temporary, mining will always centralize.
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:36:15
Notice how I never said increasing the block size is the solution. But you exaggerate, increasing the block size actually does scale to support more than 0.0000001% of the population unless you think Bitcoin with 1MB blocks has only 700 users.
Lightning also creates a network that's viable for 10s of millions of people in an optimistic scenario and for a viable Network it caps out around 15 million.
I'm not sure how you expect Bitcoin to scale to support the global population when each person on Earth would get one transaction every 30 years. Side chains and lightning don't solve anything when you can't even move Bitcoin to a side chains or channel.
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:57:51
Sure you can get transactions in before an attack starts but once an attack starts transaction confirmations could drop to 0, depending on how malicious the miners are this attack could go on for weeks.


yes they can, they can privately mine a longer chain starting one block before and at some point in the future release it causing their chain to be considered valid and the old chain to be orphaned. Realistically this takes more than 51% hash power but it's not like that's hard when we are talking about a chain with 10% hash power. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:02:47
given the current bitcoin protocol block size will need to increase at some point. Even with lightning there's only so many channels that can be opened and closed when bitcoin is limited to ~210 million transactions a year.
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:23:14
That might be true, but a chain with 10% hash power is fundamentally insecure
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:46:34


that also means there's no floor, companies have assets which means even in a liquidation there's a bottom end on the price.
The bottom price for bitcoin is 0 since it has nothing to fall back on.
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:29:50
the truth is the vast majority of users don't care.
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:19:09
Without routing the network will let 2 parties send money back and forth as fast as they want, so until someone comes up with a good routing solution the capabilities of lightning are severely ham-stringed.
Litecoin has had segwit for months so if someone had a good PoC for lightning they would be showcasing it on litecoin
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:40:11
that requires a routing table to work, how do users get this? that's about anonymous routing after a route has been determined.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:12:18


in this case there's two versions of BTC both with the same miners, so yes the longest chain will matter. If the real bitcoin has only 13% hash power it can't be secure and that means that people can't use it.
 
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:25:37


Bitcoin is not even close to that yet, you have a long long way to go.

it's not malicious though, they think they are doing whats best for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:17:08
For everyone, the protocol doesn't change based on who is using it. It might be worthwhile for you to read up on how Bitcoin works
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:23:14
The block size has already changed
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:39:52
You use a third party, 'with no third party' is a totally contrived limitation.  Your problem is 'how would you send value to someone you didn’t know with trust' it doesn't matter if you use a third party or not.
See this is the issue, you need to come up with such a contrived problem just to prove bitcoin has value, what does that really tell you?
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:04:22
yes and that time could be days weeks or months.
If there's 2 competing chains there's incentive to have users use your chain. When you can spend a small amount of money to bring the competition to a halt there's a huge incentive to do that.
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:19:03
Is bitcoin as a project better though?  
Bitcoin as a network is certainly far more secure.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:36:11
eclair is Alpha~~beta~~ software and they don't recommend using it with real money






@_date: 2017-08-23 09:39:08
That's a solvable problem
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:33:34


They know this because of routing, it's not magic.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:52:17
no one needs to run the client until right before the fork happens so at this point who knows
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:16:27
It's not less secure, it's fundamentally not secure, it would take only 11% of the total hash power to attack the chain. It only takes  1-3 pools to accomplish this.
For you that probably means use something other than Bitcoin if it happens since neither choice would be something you are happy with
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:04:57
I see, so how do you address the fact that airplanes built in the 90s dealt with this? did they use a time machine to look at bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:50:09
So how much BTC did it cost to pay for the hooker?
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:24:46
if there's a lightning **network** then every middleman is going to potentially be taking a fee from you.
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:27:14
Then provide a link. LN with routing is huge. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:32:25
Great argument. You sure are intelligent.
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:41:01
Without routing the network will let 2 parties send money back and forth as fast as they want. your example doesn't change this it shows how money can be sent over a network but not how users will route and discover paths through the network. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:11:21
nothing stops people from mining empty blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:21:03
You consider the vast majority of miners to be enemies of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:04:49
Lightning allows you to send a million transactions per second to a single person right now since no one has a solution to routing yet. It also limits the amount you can send the the amount you initially lock away via a bitcoin transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:01:03
That does not address the fact that this is based off ALPHA software that clearly states it is not meant for production.


@_date: 2017-08-18 10:24:22
I think you might have missed the 51% attack part
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:43:41
Did you pay &gt;300 Satoshis per byte? If not the fee was almost certainly too low.
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:47:06


yes it is, routing is needed for any model where you are sending money through more than one channel.


Which is why there's no PoCs in existence that come even close to real world use cases
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:49:04
Sure the users can leave or threaten to but that's not power. As Bitcoin becomes more viable and more services are built on top the threat of leaving means less and less.
Thanks control miners have isn't something that should be dismissed, we can only hope that miners fail to agree on changes.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:11:23
It's not what I want it's how the protocol works... 
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:23:06
A coin with new consensus rules is not bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:21:04
did you set an appropriate fee? 
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:05:17




@_date: 2017-08-24 22:02:07
if blocks are mined on average every 10min then the average time for your transaction to get confirmed is 5min. (assuming you pay the highest fees)
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:01:59
What we need is a solid roadmap. as we can see with segwit the decentralized nature of bitcoin makes implementing things slow as shit. If it it takes 1-2 years to go from a proposal to an implemented and running solution then we need to be preparing for problems that might come up in 2 years right now. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:08:40


it matters when there's 10x your hash power that could fuck your shit up.


Bcash is a joke, they needed to reduce difficulty just to have it function.


that's you projecting

@_date: 2018-10-04 16:11:37
The three generals problem is just an example of byzantine fault tolerance, something that airplanes have dealt with for decades.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:34:52
it's not harmful if they succeed though, UASF had harmful behavior as well and some people were OK with it.  The idea that bitcoin cash was secure when it had tiny amounts of hash power is harmful too.
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:40:11
A PoW change would be catastrophic, the safety of the network would be completely unknown since we would have no idea if an entity would be able to attack the network on a switch. that would also erode confidence in bitcoin since the PoW algo might change again and that will reduce the number of people mining bitcoin.
Also segwit2x isn't an attack, both segwit and 2mb blocks are pretty much harmless regardless of what people tell you. A real attack would be upping reward or something and both sides of that battle would lose when one side ups the reward and the other does a PoW fork.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:53:25
Remember things like "no fees" and "near instant transactions" yeah those are gone.
There was a thread yesterday where someone posted the pic comparing bitcoin to WU and that pic got removed.
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:47:00
If you change the PoW the cost of an attack could be very cheap. We wouldn't know who holds hash power and it might work out in a way where a malicious actor already has more than 51% of the hash power. There's a significant amount of risk in this.
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:22:08
it still can't, bitcoin can now handle a maximum of 200-240 million transactions  a year, that is enough for a few million people at best.
With lightning this number increases to something like 15 million people.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:42:04
if it took a few months it would already be up and running on Litecoin
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:42:24
yes, the hash power is fairly predictable.
If you change to a new PoW algo you have no clue if it's even secure or if someone can 51% attack it.
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:05:18
there was no argument, you agreed with what i said.
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:46:13
exactly, no chain can be secure when it uses a small fraction of the hash power.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:50:00


that argument can be made for anything though. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:17:42
Weird because your node can't actually do anything without connecting to other nodes
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:52:11
yes it has, the fees are currently like double the sat/byte compared to 3 weeks ago.

The cost of miners moving to a new fork of bitcoin crypto is near 0.
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:08:37
wrong, that never happened when the block size was decreased.
@_date: 2017-08-22 00:19:33


It must be awkward to not realize that if 90% of the miners go somewhere the remaining miners will be working off a husk of a coin.
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:23:25
Because there's no complete implementation for it, it's easy to have a single channel and send money but it's not easy to make a functioning network of channels
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:20:20
92.4% of miners are currently signalling their intent to fork to segwit2x, if they moved then bitcoin would be dead in the water.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:47:53
it's not what i believe, if you don't understand that you running a node isn't needed to store your bitcoins you might want to do some serious learning on how bitcoin works. I have no idea what other holes exist in your knowledge but if i was you i would be concerned
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:15:39
Every full node has the record of where every existing bitcoin is held, but you need a private key to move bitcoins from one address to another.
By having a private key you don't 'hold' bitcoins you just have the 'password' that allows you to send them. When you send bitcoins the nodes check their records to ensure that the transaction is valid.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:00:12
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:49:38
Which 
1) doesn't matter because you are making a contrived problem
2) bitcoin has no value without a third party
3) miners are a third party too.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:01:27
That doesn't invalidate his point, no one has a working proof of concept for LN that includes routing.
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:41:17
A value is just a message, you do realize that right? like that's all it takes to transfer money or access to money.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:42:42
that's not true lightning will allow us to scale to about 15million users if everyone moves to using the lightning network
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:47:37
which means segwit is 4x the size
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:44:27
The money supply has barely increased
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:58:21
Which is why there's so many proof of concepts.
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:08:52
Yes I do, do you have a source showing median speed hasn't changed over the last 10 years?
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:11:06
The miners are all signalling segwit2x. It just so happens that  theUASF also coincides with the first stage of segwit 2x.
What do you think is going to happen when they all mine blocks on a chain that the UASF nodes think is invalid? the remaining hash power will be 8% of the network(currently) which is not enough to be considered secure.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:27:25
Given that you think your node is the same as your private key it looks like even people who can run nodes don't understand Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:34:13
bitcoin nodes will support it though, are you saying that when a hard fork happens it's no longer bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:26:19
your wallet holds your private key
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:50:38


Ironic considering that you don't understand the network limitations, you are either a troll or are out of your league.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:02:25
lightning doesn't increase the number of on chain transactions.
at 220 million transactions a year each of the 15 millions users would be able to open and close 15 channels a year which is roughly what's needed to create a reliable lightning network and the regular turnover of funds allows users to inject more wealth into the lightning network.
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:03:20


That's 54 blocks which would take 3 days and 18 hours to mine on the minority chain.  Granted you don;t need to wait that long cause you can watch how the majority chain mines blocks to reduce the time.
The real issue is when only a portion of the hash power diverts to perform a sustained attack
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:13:18


there's no such thing as a channel network, no one has implemented this yet. Currently with lightning money  can be sent back and forth between the channels you have open but nothing more.
We might have years before there's a viable LN implementation, we don't know and the fact that there's no good PoCs on Litecoin is a pretty good indication we are not close.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:25:56
There's a lot of people who have no clue here
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:48:30
LN is not segwit
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:48:33


That's called routing and it doesn't exist, 
Also the hub needs to put bitcoins to each channel where users want to receive money? yeah that's not happening. A network where each user has only one channel won't be sustainable, users need multiple channels with bitcoins passing through in each direction to be confident that they can send and receive money.
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:26:58
Why would they go through all that effort instead of only confirming high fee transactions
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:46:44
Your node isn't special in any way you could shut it down tomorrow and no one else would care
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:27:30
yes you do because you can see blocks being mined.
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:39:33
Bitcoin will have to hardfork at some point to scale.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:59:24
In theory they can publish the block faster
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:08:19
How does the hub know what other channel to send money down when you send it money down yours? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:12:05
the ledger of transactions is the record of what addresses have coins, without that a private key means nothing 
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:48:03
which is routing... your solution to routing is to use software that doesn't exist and is untested.
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:35:56
except that's exactly how it works, you have no clue who holds how much hash power when you change the PoW algo.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:13:39
LN and Credit cards are both ways to transact off 'chain' and settle later.
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:34:08
They won't stop earning money though, if 92% of the miners move that's where the users will go except for the super opinionated ones.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:31:23
Not anymore, now the idea is that Bitcoin is like a base layer and we can write layers that sit on top of it to do things like have instant transactions
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:08:55
From a technical standpoint miners are clearly the most powerful piece of the network and they have been for years
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:26:35
Except a 4MB segwit block is like a 1.7MB legacy block
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:11:03
yes, and i'm telling you those two things look identical at the moment. You can't tell the difference between them. No one will be mining segwit2x blocks until after the fork
currently 87% of the blocks mined in the last 1000 blocks signaled for segwit2x though which is a pretty large majority.
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:22:10
If 92% of the miners start mining a slight variation of bitcoin it is arguably still bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:48:21
Switching pow creates an alt coin

If you are only getting 0.75% on your low risk investments you are getting ripped off
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:40:43
A channel is not the same thing as a working LN network with routing. There's real hurdles that have to be overcome to have a LN network
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:35:52
I'm not sure what anything you said has to do with my point, LN doesn't exist as a functional product yet and we don't know when it will be.
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:59:09


that's not true, the more you wait in confirmation time the more secure your transactions confirmation is, the difficulty of an attack does not change.
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:21:34
Or maybe I like Bitcoin and I want to use it? That doesn't mean I can't complain about the bad parts.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:35:10
Like a bank? That's pointless
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:53:16
Every node holds your Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:54:34
Well there's nothing else that exists that does what you want, you would need to transfer control of your Bitcoin which defeats the purpose of using Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:22:45
segwit increases TPS to about 6.6/s 
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:48:01
15 million is 14 channels per year per user that takes 100% of bitcoins Network
@_date: 2017-08-22 00:41:17


no they won't, if 90% of the hash power leaves they will find blocks at 1/10 of the rate they did before and the chain cannot be considered secure due to the hash power that could attack the chain.
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:41:01
no need to be jealous, the guy had 21 coins a year and a bit ago he's lying.
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:46:40
Everyone will notice when blocks start taking 2 hours to be mined, most people will just update their client and move on cause they don't care
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:29:19
Anyone can start a node,they are the cheapest part of the network
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:37:58
You fundamentally don't understand how bitcoin works. It doesn't matter how many off chain transactions can happen when it would take over a year to get your bitcoins off chain.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:01:35
as long as the miners have connected nodes they will have the longest chain.
the other 13% of hash power could be 51% attacked and they will be mining blocks every 1.25 hours which will bring the network to a crawl.
You also don't know what will happen over the next 2-3 months many nodes might switch over. We've never really had the miners do this before so it;s new territory
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:29:48
This is significantly less proof then an audit, you don't even know if a credible 3rd party confirmed tethers cash balances.
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:12:59


I'm going to disagree with you here, if it takes &gt;3 hours for your transaction to confirm it's because you didn't pay enough fees.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:49:02
Given the amount of hash power it has compared to the total available its hard to consider bitcoin cash secure.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:12:23


segwit only supports 1.7x the transactions and that's assuming all transactions are segwit transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:19:10


With enough hash power they can effectively revert recent transactions. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:48:17
At least I can afford to even after taxes, maybe get a job that pays actual money
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:00:59
Yes it does as does every other node

There is a difference, i get rewards when i use my visa
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:49:48


99% of nodes aren't doing this though. Also if the miners want to leave everyone else in the dust they can just make such their nodes are connected. The non 2x chain will be mining at a turtles pace until the difficulty adjustment and then be open to a 51% attack after.
If the miners stick to their agreement 2x is the only safe chain. Who knows if they actually will though
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:11:46
A fork in git doesn't mean a fork in the protocol.
@_date: 2017-08-02 09:09:28
I have, there's no functional routing solution for LN yet.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:41:17
but at some point you do need to upgrade.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:19:19


something like 5.5MB really unless you are assuming that segwit is also 4MB
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:09:07
92% signalling intent for 2x, that's a pretty large percentage
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:05:50


what happens if a block is mined when there are no transactions?
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:30:43


This is false of course, you can't drop difficulty and then claim that the chain is valid because it's longer.
That being said, I would agree with an argument that some fork is the longest valid chain as long as they use the same rules for generating blocks.
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:23:09


It's no more significant than the last time they had an 'audit'/proof of funds. without seeing all of their assets and debt we have no idea what's going on.
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:42:12
I never said it was impossible, i said it doesn't exist and with no public record of work being done it could take days and it could take decades we don't know.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:43:43
the signalling started before UASF activated so no, UASF didn't drag anyone, it had no actual impact.
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:19:52
There's no routing implementation yet though, it could take a while for that to happen.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:51:25
in Imagination land
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:50:18


 
these are all explanations of situations where the chain does not have 10% of the hash power. while a chain has only 10% of the hash power for a PoW algo it cannot be considered secure. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:01:21
15 million users is way more than the bitcoin network can support so it's something
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:43:28
The general worst case would be that there will never be another confirmed transaction.
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:58:54
Both were technically true 4+ years ago

segwit increases block size up to 4MB and segwit2x 8MB
If decentralized nodes are an issue all of these are bad

Bitcoin is high risk
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:57:55
For bitcoin to scale even with LN block size needs to increase. LN will be throttled by bitcoin before there are even 15million users. that's not even 1% of what we want bitcoin to grow to.
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:49:00
No smart user will use a chain with 10% of the hash power, it's not secure
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:19:49
When you say exchanges you mean bitfinex right? because bitfinex is the only exchange that has ever received tether from tether(the company). So how are exchanges buying tether?
Also bitfinex and tether are owned by the exact same people, they are separate entities in name alone. In situations like this multiple companies are actually the same company behind the scene
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:54:50
Yes, funds that are used to back sometime and funds to run a business are held in seperate accounts
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:49:40
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:07:43


Tether and Bitfinex are the same entity and owned by the same people. 


not really, my point is just that you can't claim tether is without a doubt backed without looking at the full balance sheet of the company.
according to your math banks should actually have almost double the assets since customer deposits are not liabilities and don't matter
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:29:15
It's not about what's important. It's about what groups can use.
With segwit less than a million people could use Bitcoin as a replacement to their regular payment methods. With lightning that number increases to like 15 million. This means mass adoption at the scale you want is currently not possible
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:12:38
yeah, it's that insane anyone would trust that.
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:21:04
you literally cannot send coins between channels without routing. you are saying "what if we all knew exactly how the network worked" yes if every actor was omnipotent then routing would be solved.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:39:29
It's not very complicated.
They need an auditor to come in and take a look at their books to prove that they have cash in their accounts that matches the tether issued as well as what their other assets are and proof that the cash in their tether accounts is not used for anything else.


No they didn't. for all you know all of that money is bitfinex customer deposits and is in fact not backing tether. You need to see both debts and assets to properly assess this.
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:21:31


nope, that's not what i said. Only tether/bitfinex needs to be complicit.


No they didn't, if they opened their books they would have additional accounts that the company uses as well as liabilities.
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:20:16


Every node with a full blockchain has your bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:30:40
When there's a hard fork both chains are valid. When both chains use the same hashing algos and one has a huge majority of the hash power the other chain is open for exploitation and effectively useless.
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:15:23
Yeah you are inventing things that aren't bitcoin. The first hard fork that's just cause is an attack.
@_date: 2018-06-14 11:21:20


Actually no, you ask for proof when presented with a claim. It's not up to anyone to disprove it. It's up to tether to prove what they claim.
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:59:28
'Instant' was marketed for small purchases years ago before RBF, it was arguable not true back then but it was a huge marketing point. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:13:24


Nope, they are saying "based on what we have been told it appears that there's enough USD to cover the USDT"
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:40:17


It's in the paper, they have looked at two accounts. 


All of them and all their assets and liabilities, that's how an audit works.


they knew exactly what they were doing which is why their paper outlines what the limitations are. This company wasn't lying or deceiving anyone.
Also if tether only has two accounts that's sketchy as fuck, if they are backing tether then their business account should be separate,
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:42:14
The law firm states that the information is only as credible as the 3rd parties they got it from.
All we have is two bank balances that don't match the amount of tether issued, what this means is either they are earning interest or that they are using these accounts for other purposes(not tether)
Without also seeing their debts and other accounts we also don't know if this money is backing tether. For example this money could also include money they owe to customers for deposits.
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:44:02
You would get 1 transaction a year, how useful would that be? At least gold can be bought or sold whenever
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:47:27
The bitcoin rules have already changed though
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:13:10
you didn't get an invite because you have a near insignificant amount of power when it comes to dictating how bitcoin runs. As users we don't matter
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:29:09


Bitfinex already has customer money though, how do you know that this isn't just 2.5 billion of customer deposits
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:57:35
I think you're catching on to my point, if it's so easy to verify why wasn't it?
All we see is that there are two accounts with USD that are worth a little more than the tether issued. It's like me showing I have a 500k house and 250k in the bank so my net worth must be 750k when really i also have a 400k mortgage and 100k in credit card debt.
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:02:29


really? what other debt do they have? do they have other assets to back that?
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:15:15
It means that there's no guarantee it's backed just that they have been given information that it's backed.
I could provide information showing i am worth 500 billion, does that mean you should trust me?
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:57:45
picture is probably from 2013, notice how it also says instant? It sort of was before RBF
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:59:49
segwit and LN already have known limitations and LN doesn't even have an actual implementation with routing. So yes we need to plan on how to scale.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:13:44


so they can learn to deal with not having replay protection then?
@_date: 2018-06-20 22:13:08
If that's the case the pegging account is more than 500 million short
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:12:43
They had access to two bank accounts with money in them. tether almost certainly has more accounts. They aren't using the USD that backs USDT for day to day expenses so they need to have at least one more account. In addition to this we have no idea what liabilities they have. 
Do you not understand that liabilities are crucial in determining worth?
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:01:30


They didn't make it though, they traded for it, some exchanges may have traded USD for it others may have traded crypto.


because you need liabilities to calculate net worth. let me give you an example. John has a 450k house and a 50k car. according to you john is worth 500k and we don't need to look any further. in reality john also has a 400k mortgage and a 30k car loan, he's only worth 70k.
And that's why you need to look at liabilities, if these are the only assets bitfinex/tether has and they have other liabilities(like customer deposits) then they actually don't have the funds to back it. We don't know since we only see a small slice of data which is easy to manipulate.
All we do know is bitfinex/tether has 2.5 billion in the bank
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:00:48




yes there is, this happens all the time when companies open their books.


It could be, tether claims that the money they have in the bank is used to back tether, it could also be from other debts they have(like cash deposits to bitfinex)
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:13:30
so your node does talk to other nodes that follow the same rules aka you know other nodes exist
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:39:42


Learn basic economics, if an entire category is unprofitable then there are 3 options. Reduce costs, Increase price or discontinue.
Mining costs are fixed, you can't really reduce them so the alternative is to increase price or stop. As soon as all mining becomes unprofitable you are going to see no transactions confirmed under a fee threshold
@_date: 2018-11-05 22:43:40
no it's not lol, most people use banks for more then a chequing account.
@_date: 2018-11-01 19:38:13
Great so let's go back to my original point, show me one bank that lent out more than it has deposited.
You can't because it doesn't happen and you don't understand the banking system
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:48:21
The problem is that once you start examining bitcoin it's obvious that there are flaws. That's why we get optics change every time a flaw becomes an actual issue. 
in 2013-2013 the big hype was '0 fees, instant 0conf transactions for small purchases' now neither of those things are really true.
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:16:08
These are 2 seperate things
Bitfinex is unpegging.
Tether is backed 1:1 although you pay a 0.1% fee to deposit and a 1000 to 1-3% fee(whatever is bigger) to withdraw
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:48:55
That's a time commitment too, &gt;80% of poker players aren't profitable and of the ones that are most probably earn less than just getting a job.
@_date: 2018-11-01 20:31:44
Various reasons, but not because they lent out more money then deposits.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:09:59
my bad i misread.
Still, my point stands. It's not the reward that justifies risk it's also the probability of a reward.
@_date: 2018-11-02 15:32:26


No they are't bitcoin doesn't compete with banks, it's just another asset banks can leverage to make money
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:39:03


There's 0 reasons why anyone needs bitcoin, it's like arguing someone needs a Visa.
You can claim it's amazing and whatever but user adoption doesn't lie, it's clear bitcoin is a fringe product and no one actually cares about it. Look at the number of users who aren't investors and you will have a very clear picture.
It's like saying people need Diaspora, turns out no one actually cares at all. The only difference here is people see a way to get rich quick with bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:36:02


That's not what it was at all,'be your own bank' was something that came up with in 2012-2014.
No one with any understanding of how banks works thinks that bitcoin will replace them

@_date: 2018-11-22 13:30:07


it actually partially does, batch transactions take up more space on the blockchain so we get to the same result, for example we currently have 2.5 addresses per transaction and we are at about 3 transactions per second.


We can't, and the fact that people are jumping through hoops to try to get around arbitrary restrictions shows how insane the community is. It's like saying 'we will use 56k internet but try and make the best compression algorithms ever'

more like "If everyone is on a scaffold then they don't care what the ground is made of"
Which is a perfect analogy, if no one needs to use on chain bitcoin transactions then no one actually needs to use bitcoin. It's the same as how no one cares how technology works as long as it works the way they want, do you think 99% of people care what companies built the components in the tech they consume? 
So when there's multiple layers of abstraction over bitcoin there's no reason to justify bitcoin over a competitor and that just results in a matter of time until someone comes along with a competitor that has better optics.

If the users don't follow they won't be able to use bitcoin because there's no functioning network and the remaining hash power could not even protect the network from an attack. 


If users are sitting on bitcoin because of percieved future value then miners can as well, the miners have a working chain and can plug away with the intention to sell later, if anyone ever wants to use bitcoin again they will also need to use the working chain. Don't forget that anyone sending transactions on the old chain is also sending transactions on the new chain so miners can still grab those fees.


The NYA agreement was a compromise, some people wanted more block size, some wanted a hard for. They all sat down in a room and figured it out. UASF is a tiny amount of loud users on this subreddit. It's way less important than these people would like to think


BCC is terrible and has nothing to do with the NYA agreement other than some people wanting things that will not happen in the short term. segwit + 2x block size is reasonable. BCC is not reasonable in any form since it's throwing away segwit which immediately alienates a huge chunk of users as well as potential future improvements like lightning.
The majority of hash power is what lets our network function, if the ever decide to work together towards a goal that's even slightly unreasonable we are all in trouble.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:10:44


Except they don't because one chain is mining blocks every 12 minutes and the other is mining blocks every 66 minutes.


You are too focused on implementation details, it's not about with current variation/fork of bitcoin is ideologically correct. It's about the fact that if there's something like an 85/15 split or even like a 65/35 split the smaller side would be too unsafe to be stable.
I'm not sure why you think this has anything to do with how i feel or if some alternate version of bitcoin is valid, i'm just explaining a simple situation. if there's a 85% fork to a 2mb that's the chain users will go to, just like if there's a 15% for to 2mb that's the chain users won't go to. It's all about the hash power.
And yeah obvious if there was a fork were the vast majority of miners became malicious we would have problems but at that point bitcoin will have basically failed

If one chain has 15% hash power the other chain could 51% with only 18% of their hash power, that's small enough that it would only take 1-3 actors.
And that's ignoring the fact that it would take &gt;1 hour per block being mined so you would have the choice between 12 minute blocks or 66 minute blocks. Which do you think the users will choose?
I think you might have a lot to learn here.

I think you vastly underestimate the importance of miners.


That creates a weaker chain and everyone loses. This is a nuclear option that will tank price due to the uncertainty it causes. If PoW needs to change because of miners then how do you know it won;t need to again?


Except you can't difficulty is too high, it would take too long and be open to attack after it adjusts unless you change PoW.

@_date: 2017-07-18 19:09:29


Unless you are the one causing a chain split and you make a new type of transaction that's invalid on the old chain your transaction will be valid on both chains. In the case of both segwit and the 2mb increase the miners can send your transaction. Alternatively you food send transactions on the other chain first but that still means you are paying fees.
And no there's no countermeasures for a 51% attack when another chain has 5.5 times the hash power, the weaker chain runs the risk of being wreaked at any point in time.

Who knows I'm not entirely convinced we will ever see a majority of miners commit to a fork but if they do it's potentially really bad.


it's also sacrificing all security in the network, that's potentially catastrophic.

@_date: 2017-07-30 19:09:49
if 1MB is too large why raise it to 4MB? 
The ugly truth is bitcoin doesn't scale, segwit+lightning solves that kinda but lightning is vaporware at this point since no one has figured out how to handle routing. In addition lightning still requires 2 transactions per channel and optimistically caps out at around 15million users.
On the flip side upping block size is really a bandied, it doesn't solve any scaling problem it just delays it. but bitcoin will need to hard fork so there's an argument there as well.
the real compromise would be do nothing until someone came up with a real solution + actual implementation exists. Even this would make people unhappy so who knows.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:45:15


yes they can, if they have a single node and mine blocks with different they have created a hard fork.
miners are the only group who can create a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:14:55


no they won't, if bitcoin on the 2 chains have the same value then the amount of money earned will be the same since they will earn the same amount of bitcoin on the fast and slow chain. This only changes once the dificulty changes which will also take 100x as long when blocks are mined every 10 hours. That means on average it will take more than a year for the difficulty to change.


Before and after the retarget period they are vulnerable to a 51% attack, it would take only 3% of the hash power to do that to the 10 hour block time chain. This makes it too risky as an investment since there's at least 6 different pools that could short it then 51% attack the chain for massive profits. investors would be insane to rely on this chain.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:16:43
if say 90% of the miners agreed to fork then yes, they would force it through.
You would be looking at block confirmation times of 1.6 hours and the original chain could easily attack the weaker chain at any point in time.

can you point me to an implementation that includes routing? I thought that had not been completed yet.

the article was about 10 million users where each user had 14 channels, 
at 100 million users with 14 channels it would take 3 years to open all 700 million channels and that's assuming there are no channels closed and no other transactions.

What are you talking about? A &gt;1mb block was mined as soon as there were enough transactions and the issue was fixed without a code change.

Hashing power is the only thing that secures the network, if you move to a network with a small fraction of the hash power it's by definition not secure.
You are conflating the morality of actions with the reality of actions. It doesn't matter what's right or wrong if there's a chain with only 15% hash power it only takes one or two actors to destroy it. This is why we want as many people as possible providing hash power to a single chain so no cabal of bad actors can take over.
You really shouldn't be calling me new when you clearly don't understand the fundamentals of how bitcoin functions
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:24:52
You clearly didn't hear me, you still have no understanding of the dev process for bitcoin.

You don't even know what these words mean and you have no idea if the client is buggy and/or untested. It takes minimal knowledge of the bitcoin development process to know that there's a couple layers of testing. There's also a review process and people including luke-jr have reviewed pull requests for btc1/bitcoin.
You should really learn to think for yourself instead of parroting what you read. This has nothing to do with segwit2x being good or not and everything to do with you not understanding the dev process while having an option on it. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:20:03


it won't since transactions are posted to both chains so a high fee transaction will exist on the segwit chain as well.

It's not about what i want. it's about reality. If 85% of the miners choose to fork where it's not breaking(2MB isn't breaking btw) then users will follow. And be fair the client has been tested and isn't any more buggy than the core client.
for the record i don't care either way but spreading things that aren't true doesn't help anyone it just weakens bitcoin as a whole.

Luke Dashjr has reviewed pull requests for example:   
If you think Garzik writes buggy code you should 100% review it, there's a non zero percent chance that it will become the main bitcoin version. If you think that's a risk then you need to protect yourself.

which is just another blockchain now there's 3 instead of 2. the one with 80% hash power still remains the most secure since you have no idea what hardware exists that can attack the new chain.
Changing PoW because of miners indicates that bitcoin has failed.
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:13:43
it still solves the same problem it always did.
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:44:49
You didn't compromise. You lost because you were browbeaten into submission.
And the block size(aka transaction throughput) has to increase. If it doesn't it means bitcoin failed.
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:53:26


users and nodes are easy to replace, hash power is not. The majority of has power has significantly more weight when deciding how the network should change. If something like 80% of the hash power can agree on a change and stick to it the users and nodes have pretty much zero choice.
This is the entire reason why hash power needs to be decentralized
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:58:14
so let's recap, you claimed the code is unreviewed untested and buggy yet you have no proof of any of these things 
and there's actually information showing that this is at least partially untrue but at least you have copy/paste. sure looks like a strong argument
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:27:13
How many monthly users(not investors) does bitcoin have?
