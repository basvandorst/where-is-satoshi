very cool
it's nice to see politicians who not only reached out to learn about a new tech, but also are showing some understanding of the tech by using it in an announcement about their recommendation of a "light touch"

who would advertise to patrons who hoard rather than spend?

I'll vote for almost anyone who isn't a political science major or a lawyer.
@_date: 2014-06-02 18:04:34
it's mostly the lawyers who worry, because it's fewer assets they can sponge out of a client. fuck em

since you use gmail, you should append the name of the company or mailing list to your email, like this:
so for instance, if I signed up for cavirtex or whatever, I would sign up with:
this way you can track where spam is coming from, and block those emails

vertcoin has some interesting assets. ASIC resistance and the kimoto gravity well difficulty algorithm is different as well

Which is why these big players are getting involved. With the right connections and some hard work, you could be on top of a multinational bitcoin empire. These guys could be the next Wall Street.

Why is your rebate system the worst I've ever encountered? I had my rebate declined on delivery, and then got routed through endless emails that went nowhere when I tried to find out why my perfect submission was declined.
I'd rather pay a few extra bucks than ever deal with your nonsense again.

I don't know if it works for other email services, but with gmail it doesn't matter, hell I could make my email even more unique by inserting periods, like this: U.S.E.R.N.A.M.E+memo and it would go to username
so for me, I could make it Ver.it.ably.Clean+RedditExample and it would all go to veritablyclean
but if what you're saying is that your username is x and not x+z then you obviously have to login with x I'm just saying it's a good habit to get into, making your username USER+memo because it identifies sources of spam and it makes it more difficult for someone else to guess your user details

you could make a multi sig wallet with like 10 paper codes stashed in multiple different places. Like a horcrux

Do you understand marginal tax rates?
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:56:48
Well do you or don't you? People making over 10 million annually would be charged at the top tax bracket 54.2% (and for their income between 2 million and 10 million, it's only 50.2%, so 4.98 million there) and they don't need you defending them. Unless you're making that kind of money, in which you should probably vote Clinton.

The silk road made a violent trade structured and safe for buyers and sellers. What's your point?

You can nullify laws as a jury, but most judges know this and will absolutely remove you from the jury if you even hint at that option.
