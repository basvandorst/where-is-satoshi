I wouldn't say you are completely wrong. But I would argue that its pretty unlikely. Binance has 5 million users alone. I would say theres much, much more then 3 million people. Also, coinbase received 100million in funding a few months back. Those people funding do their due diligence. They aren't throwing money at something with the expectation that it will be disallowed in 6 months. They have looked into regulation and most likely rub elbows with congressman and senators so they are more in tune with that stuff then we are. There's also the idea of blockchain and innovation.  There's real use cases that can enhance society. Putting an end to that now would most likely not be in the best interest because other countries are not shutting it down. This is all a competition and if Japan or Russia are making strides technologically, you know other countries will want to follow and keep up.
Again, I wouldn't say this stuff wont be outlawed, but I think theres a fair enough reasons to considered its not going to happen immediately

Generating income is not the system roots value proposition by any means. That individual mentioned it as a side effect of the platform, but by no means is it a root proposition. I am not going to get into the merits and negatives of NEO because I am not trying to shill/FUD the coin.  Right now, NEO serves a purpose and has done a solid job at what it is setting out to do. Something that cant be said for 95% of coins and some would even include bitcoin in that 95%. As I wrote, is it possible BTC has success with Rootstock and essentially negates other cryptos that offer smart contract platforms? Sure it is. Is it possible that by the time that's implemented, these coins could have solidified their role, built a community, reputation and found a niche that wont disappear? I think its very possible. 
BTC is 50 percent of my portfolio. I am not anti BTC  by any means, but I think putting all the eggs in one basket is not the smartest move. If you are right and BTC consumes 90% of alts than great. If however, it doesnt pan out that way, at least I own some other options that could implement blockchain in a another way.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:19:03
I mean scaling solutions are being worked on for both. I own both, more so BTC but I dont think its one or the other. I think BTC can find its role as the backbone of crypto and ETH will have its role as the smart contract leader and ICO facilitator. I think they can work in unison. As it stands now, BTC collapsing would be terrible for the entire space.
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:43:05
The money is coming from GAS. Which is the token needed to use the NEO platform and what each NEO token "generates". GAS can be traded on many exchanges for bitcoin. NEO has its flaws, there's no doubt but it is not a pyramid scheme. Its been around for well over 2 years and GAS can be collected every 5 minutes on their NEON wallet. Multiple coins run on their network and need  GAS to operate. As an aside, I own both NEO and BTC and I would say there is a chance BTC consumes NEO role as a platform coin in the future but that isnt imminent. I would at the minimum visit their website or google a coin before calling it a pyramid.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:04:17
That’s just bitcoin. Many many other Blockchains exist that serve more then a role as a currency. I think btc does have value but blockchain is transformative 
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:05:44
Not for nothing though, ETH has its own scaling issues. Not like its the perfect system yet either.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:16:40
Not sure they can pull it off again. Everyone knows now that the dip was caused or at least triggered by the future contracts. Now everyone will pay close attention to it
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:12:34
Not saying the fanboy isn’t out of hand because it is. But I wouldn’t dismiss the underlying technology. I work in finance, one of the largest banks in the world, plenty are in crypto and a top senior director said the company is looking close at blockchain There are coins now that have big money backing them and are going to implement blockchain to solve real problems. I wouldn’t dismiss the space completely because of 1 subreddit. To each his own though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:47:08
So were in agreement. I dont want the way forward to be big blocks, I want a increase in size to alleviate some pressure for the time being. If the increase in block is needed anyways, why not do it sooner? I think LN is the way forward but I also think we cant just put progress on hold until it comes out which can be in a month or a year or more.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:49:21
I don't think anyone will use BTC as a currency, but that doesn't mean it cant be used, it just wont be the preferred coin for day to day spending. Once the capability is in place, and you really can have the option to spend it anywhere, we will really see what this tech can do.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:01:57
So many ppl don’t realize this. All the time I am like btc is not a finished product. For god sakes, Amazon was a book seller for years, Apple made only big mediocre computers. Btc is still changing
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:05:45
Yes we do. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:50:23
I hear that but it’s such a long way off. If the time comes where visa is setting up master nodes then btc will be worth much more. It’s like you’re looking at step 50 when we’re barely at step 2. Other aspects of the tech can be created in the meantime or unforeseen developments. I’m not saying what you claim won’t happen, I am just saying that there’s slot of time in between for resolutions to be figured out.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:06:40
Well I would think these people are leaving their coins on exchanges. So they aren't really moving across the network to sell. The backlog comes into play when moving coins on and from an exchange
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:24:26
It kind of does though. If you buy futures as downside risk protection, you can put contracts to people at certain prices of btc. So if you own 100 contracts that give you the right to put each contract (lets 1,000 per contract) to someone if the price reaches 10k per bitcoin, you have that protected because if btc does drop you will put those contracts and receive your money. 
Now if btc continues to go up, you lost the amount of money you spent on the contracts but btc has gone up in value so you profited on that side as well.
Thats my general understanding of contracts and i could be wrong, but for miners who recieve bitcoin, if the price goes down they make money on the futures and if it goes up they make money on the btc increased value.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:35:04
I agree on this point. Once the futures came out, it added legitimacy to it. I'm curious to know if any futures commodity has gone to 0. Id venture to say it has not.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:08:14
These are important points. But its necessary to realize that bitcoin isnt a finished product. Like many things and products its always evolving. I mean you look at Amazon, Apple Netflix etc. what did thy start out at? Bitcoin is still relatively new (under 10 years). The ability to spend it as a currency is coming. Theres millions of dollars and tons of developers working on this and many other features. I agree, its somewhat like a bet but its also could be highly speculative investment. I would say people are betting that btc will be used in some form or fashion for years to come. If it just exists it will maintain value. Obviously many people are pouring there money in and yes it is dangerous. But i dont see this going to 0. Unless there is some sort of major even that shakes it (which is entirely possible) i think it will continue to evolve and change.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:07:07
Buy em. Same shit ppl said abt btc. Been in since the 30s at lite. Ppl were saying same shit then.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:53:08
I know block size increases aren't popular, but I think we need to have a small bump in size. Yes the traffic will still clog it, but if it helps even 10% its worth it. I also think the sentiment would be excellent in terms of good news and the ability for compromise and recognize the issue. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:28:30
As my understanding of it, there needs to be someone on the other side of the so called "bet" or else whose going to pay them if their short hits?  Other people shorting? 
Maybe I am wrong.
I think what we see in the beginning is crazy volatility on both sides. Well see strong selling in large volume followed by large buying until it evens itself out. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:31:17
You’re not the only one. I don’t think non stop growth is healthy or normal. It needs to stabilize for a little. Anything above 10k and I’m happy.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:38:24
I’ll tell you why. I work in this field as well. Firstly you need to realize that the target audience for financial advisors isn’t your young millennial that’s comfortable doing everything from computers. It’s people that are 50 plus, working, saving for retirement. It’s also high net worth people who need actual financial planning, tax harvesting advice and other tools the common person won’t have. Advisors are able to offer advice and opinions and executions on plans for people who don’t have the time or The knowledge to do it on their own. Of course there’s also many incentives that banks group together. Like her invest 200k with your local advisor and get a better mortgage rate or banking package. 
I think that in 20-30 years the field will shrink as robo advising becomes more popular but there will always be people who just don’t want to do it themselves and will seek professional assistance.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:23:19
Because there is no guarantee it drops or when it drops. I mean yeah, there will be a big correction at some point. But timing that is hard. Yes, you could get it right a few times, but eventually you will get it wrong and have to buy back higher.
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:03:25
Im reading your posts and I am not agreeing or disagreeing on most of your points except one. Many, many people own bitcoin outside of this subreddit. I would hardly use this subreddit as a measurement for the total btc holders. Of course on Reddit which has a demographic targets of younger people, the amount holding over 1k may be small. But on the larger scale many people own over 1k in btc. I personally know multiple people and they know people and none of us are tech savvy early adopters.
If setting up a node is easy and profitable I would gladly set one up as would most people that have a profit incentive. People would buy in to set up nodes. Maybe youre right in that the biggest nodes will receive the most attention and therefore it does become somewhat centralized. But there could easily be a middle ground. I dont see it as an all or none scenario. If you have some centralization than the entire thing fails? I disagree on that. Every coin will have some degree of it including btc.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:17:33
Unless theres a fundamental problem or legislation that comes out, a crazy crash isn't likely. Price corrections happen, but only black swan events could cause a 90 percent drop like that. Theres potential for that to happen though so I would never rule it out.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:52:27
The way I look at it, it just needs the ability to be used as a currency. It doesn’t actually have to be used as one but if it has the ability, the underlying utility as a store of value and transportable wealth with the ability to be spent in most places Will allow cryptos and btc to maintain
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:11:14
I dont think it should be one or the other. It should be both working in unison.
Atomic Swaps.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:56:32
Not disagreeing.But these coins haven't proved anything in reality. When hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people try moving it around, then we can see what they really do. I own some alts and they all sounds good in theory and I'm sure some will be the real deal. But outside of BTC, ETH and LTC, even BCH, none are really being utilized day to day with even close to as much volume.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:45:01
No one can answer this question accurately. This is uncharted waters for every single person.  This could be worth 50k in a year or 1k in 3 months. If you decide to put money in, hold it for at least a year before you make any decisions.
Good Luck 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:45:58
I am big in BTC, big believer in the tech. That being said, I wouldnt say its impossible for it to correct like that. Black swan events happen, but if one does happen, than buying BTC wouldnt necessarily make sense. If say regulations come that really mess it up, why would one want to own it? I suppose its all situational on what causes the correction. At this point, i dont see it dropping that low without there being a significantly bad piece of news. 
Nothing is impossible. Many thought BTC rising to 10k was impossible but here we are.  I would never rule it out 100%
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:47:04

Awesome to see. Bitcoin expanding all over the world. People should be celebrating this. This is exactly what you want to see. I don't care if its in Israel or Turkey or Iceland. The brand is expanding, the knowledge is expanding and the population of users is expanding. That's whats important.
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:59:24

@_date: 2017-08-03 17:08:37
Had the same question yesterday. The way I basically understood it was the chain replicated, any key that held BTC prior to fork was "credited" (not sure the right word, but it made sense to me) on the new chain with the same amount of BCH. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 02:34:45

I mean lets say I send .5 bitcoin from the wallet to an exchange to sell, do I lose access to that .5 BCH? or is it completely built into the private seed and its never gone until I extract it? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:49:44
I feel like everyone expects that and as usual the market will do the opposite 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:16:43
See if you think about it,  at that moment, introducing something as gold 2.0 would be ludicrous. I think in order to "sell" this to people and other developers, a day to day cash protocol is much easier. 
As the product evolves the nature of its utility changes. It accidentally stumbles on another niche that just falls into place. You can see that with Amazon and Apple as well as well as many other business. 
I think BTC is going through similar growth and continues to  evolve. The day to day payment option will become available at some point, but in the meantime it seems to have found a purpose.

All fair points. But I think btc is more then just a currency. It's not like something that's ever existed before so we all have a tendcy to pigeonhole it into our previous ideas. Really I think it's something that is in a class of its own. It has properties of gold, properties of currency and properties of investment. Right now this technology is new. It will continue to evolve assuming it continues to exist. To me it will never replace USD or anything like that, but I do see it as a global alternative currency  and gold 2.0. I think people park money into assets specifically not tied to the stock market as a hedge in times of a downturn so I see btc as kind of like that position you hold as a small percentage of your portfolio. I also see it as a way to travel anywhere and never need to exchange currencies. I can go to Korea and use bitcoin or Finland and use it. Now we aren't there yet, years away in fact. But I think if ease of use increases, adoption increases, price swings become less and less wild, my view can begin to take shape. At this stage though, it's speculative. We don't know that this tech is not hacksble or there won't be some unforeseen issue that pops up. That can all very well happen. But I think bitcoin is revolutionary and I think if bitcoin is around in 5 years it will be worth more then it is today.

I think thats most people biggest fear when it comes to bitcoin. The government coming and saying "nope, not happening anymore, you have 30 days to get your money out". If they perceive it as a real threat it could very well happen. I dont believe bitcoin will ever replace USD or the Pound or Euro and frankly, its not something that should be striven for because if that does happen, then the rules, regs and tightening will happen. I just want to see a globalized alternative. Gold 2.0 that can go around the world, spent everywhere and used as hedge against the markets and global terror. Everyone has a small piece of bitcoin in their portfolios. Maybe pick some up before a trip instead of exchanging currencies. To me, thats what I would like to see. May not fit into the narrative of this sub but trying to disrupt the government is a dangerous line to cross.
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:07:51
Well if you owned BTC in your own wallet prior, your eligible for BCH of the equal amount. However, I added post fork coins in there as well. Now though, another fork is coming, and I want to make sure I wont have issues come Nov

@_date: 2017-09-18 01:16:46
While this would never happen,it is possible to be accomplished. You wouldnt even know its happening. It wouldnt be obvious whats really going on. Yeah the price would rise, but not if it happened over 2 years. These companies hire professional traders and strategists that are expert financial analysts do trade in equity/bond markets. If they wanted to, they would be able to enter at the right time and no one would know.
That said, this scenario wouldnt really happen. Its a business, they make tons of money selling different financial instruments. Having everyone buy something that would take away from that wouldnt make sense to them. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:32:05
I think it's the other way. Move coins to another wallet, confirm all has arrived, sweep original keys to bch supported wallet. Move bch coins to exchange I believe hitbtc is the popular one. Sell or exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:31:36
So i agree, something like this is possible.  I mean the bigger it gets, the more likely it is. But then I think, there's millions upon millions of dollars in bitcoin/crypto, if not billions. I am not talking about market cap, i am talking about venture capitalism and investors pouring money into different applications that could be used on bitcoin and the crypto space in general. Those venture capitalists are very, very wealthy people and like them, have friends who are very wealthy. I would think that many of these individuals have friends in the government (congressman,senators governors etc etc) and are more in tune with the governments general view on this then we are. I dont see why they would make these investments (coinbase just received 100million in funding) without their due diligence and part of that would be to know all the different risks involved. They decided to go through anyways which indicates to me they dont see government interference as a major threat anytime soon. 
I think inevitably regulations will come out but i dont see a coordinated shut down attack.
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:21:38

I think hes on the fence of investing into it. When I say invest, i dont mean trading (which they still would). I mean actually actively work on it and create a way to generate income for their company month over month and year over year. Imagine they are the first bank to offer it. Inevitably it will generate attention, generate clients, younger clients. They can now charge commissions on those trades. Also, lets say they roll out bitcoin insurance, or your bitcoin is safe on their app/platform or insured up to a dollar amount. Even more clients. Now with those new clients you can talk about diversifying and getting into the market and another area of revenue. 
I mean, there is opportunities for a bank and a big reputable one to carve out a position in this space and capitalize. They dont care about the philosophy or what it represents, its how can we make investors happy. How can we generate profits. 
Here in this 300k person sub, we talk about the merits and the possibilities of bitcoin, what it means to the world. But its a very, very large world out there.

Good points. There is no prediction though, my point simply being that at certain levels its good to sell. At no point would I liquidate my entire crypto position, more so sell a bit here or there when different prices are met. Take money out at points so that if it does crash, as it will because it is cyclical, you have money on the sideline for additional purchases and also some profit if cryptos arent at the point where its used daily.
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:31:23
I had this discussion the other day with a friend. I think people should have specific sell levels wherever they may be. I agree though, at a certain point, recouping initial investment makes sense. I would never full liquidate my crypto but there's some logic to taking chips off the table. To me, its more so, don't sell on wild down swings.
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:07:24
Yup, I didn't want to mention litecoin specifically but it does seem to have the potential to fill that role. Realistically though, its impossible to know what coin will come out in the future that can overtake everything. I am hoping BTC remains at the forefront but that is far from a guarantee.

I hold mine. People don't want to trade in and out. Timing the markets isn't easy. Maybe you're able to do in which case I understand your viewpoint. However bitcoin so far has shown that if you just hold it, it will increase in value over time. Is that a guarantee? No way. But those who do buy and hold and believe in bitcoin believe that it should continue to rise.

Ive thought about this angle as well and there's two common responses I see.
1) The hope is that Bitcoin will be basically the main source of comparison for other cryptos and it would be used for larger purchases. Meaning, another crypto at some point, will be the day to day transactional coin and bitcoin will be the store of value in which all other cryptos get valued. This is obviously in a reality in which bitcoin and cryptos in general become more widely accepted.
2) Depending on where you live, being able to store bitcoin is a luxury. Poorer countries don't have as many options, their  currency is in flux and they don't have the luxury to see what the price of BTC will be tomorrow. If they need to spend it now, they spend it now. 
This is all speculation of course. Just some answers I have seen.

At this point, I understand why they dont. I dont really blame them either. Bitcoin isnt ready for full mainstream use. Its ease of access and usability isnt ready for every common man. We are a few years away from that.

No one knows the answers. It could drop under 2k or go back to 2600. Clearly this is a volatile asset that swings wildly day to day.
If youe trying to make a quick buck, it would be difficult. Either buy and hold and stomach the swings, or do not buy at all. Trying to time and predict is almost impossible.

So if were leaving the coins on electrum, were controlling the private keys and come aug 1, regardless of what happens w. coinbase or any exchange, should be in good shape?
