Haha the curve could definitely fit better, and yeah for our sakes lets hope this is the "lowest possibility".
The main point of this image is to put into perspective what a bitcoin chart would look like if we were to continue our exponential bull run up into 6 figure territory. Notice how all the noise between 3k-20k seem almost flat here, as opposed to the traditional charts that show massive rips up and down over the last 2 years. Comes to show how perspectives can radically shift over time, especially in crypto. Historically it's what bitcoin has done over the past few years.

Really wish this site was not for profit. Because all the bitcoin skeptics are just going to see this site and think "sigh ... yet another person trying to make a quick buck on this bitcoin boom".
I'm sorry but spending a few days to come up with some mediocre reasons and putting those on mugs and other things isn't really novel. I just feel like you are trying to profit from this, which is perfectly fine, but I wish there was a bit more time coming up with that list.
"[**Reason To Use Bitcoin  The demand is increasing faster than the supply.]( " : I'm sorry, why is this a reason to use bitcoin? It might be a reason to buy it but this doesnt tell me shit about why bitcoin is useful, other then "because price going up long term" which nocoiners have heard millions of times
" [**Reason To Use Bitcoin  Whatever can be done over the internet will be done over the internet.]( " : You can send venmo payments and whatnot over the internet. How does this tell me why I should use bitcoin?
" [**Reason To Use Bitcoin  We haven’t seen much innovation in money itself for over one hundred years.]( " more lies. Venmo, Visa, Paypal, are these not innovations in money? But lightning network is??
" [The value of Bitcoin is not its price.]( " : Ok, but WHY THE FUCK SHOULD I USE BITCOIN?
" [**Reason To Use Bitcoin  The Bitcoin space needs more leaders, not more followers.]( " : Ok, but again, how does this tell me why I should use bitcoin. WHy the fuck should I buy this shirt??
" [**Reason To Use Bitcoin  Money is nothing more than a number in a database.]( " I literally don't even have the words here
" [**Reason To Use Bitcoin  Banking is changing …with or without the banks.]( " : real low effort here
" [**Reason To Use Bitcoin  It will unite more peole from more countries than any political union.]( " Oh look, another vague statement with a typo in the main site. Did you even spend the 2 minutes it takes to click the ABC spellcheck before publishing this?
" [**Reason To Use Bitcoin  Your bank isn’t open-source.]( " : Do you really think the average person cares about whether a bank is open source or not? Your car is not open source, yet you drive it. Reddit isn't open source, yet you use it.

Here is the same exponential curve slightly shifted upward to fit the current price action

People said reaching 100$ was ridiculous
Then they said reaching 1000$ was ridiculous
Then they said reaching 10,000$ was ridiculous
Now they say reaching 100,000$ is rediculous

for bigger buys I would suggest buying USDC through coinbase, transferring to binance, then taking advantage of the .15% fees.  
For the biggest buys I suggest buying BNB which offers an even greater discount when you buy through binance (assuming you haven't used binance before)

I'm glad you took the time to consider each of my points, I am rooting (and counting on) for people like to you bring more awareness into crypto.
Nice work!!

Which is why personally I would recommend a dollar cost average strategy as the market can be pretty unforgiving

It's not just going up in a straight line, so why buy at the peak of greed when you can wait for the price to drop 20% and buy more?

Love it. You’re doing god’s work
