Than that's more accounts than Satoshi's :) have a good live though
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:01:13
Bitcoin =/= a Twitter account named Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:04:19
Make an account on an exchange that accepts fiat (euro, dollar, whatever). Then get verified and buy as much as you want.
After that, when you can breath again, think about getting a hardware wallet
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:07:25
Not at all, you can buy fractions of a Bitcoin. If however you don't want to invest much, I suggest buying via Gdax instead of Coinbase (same account, same business, other website) to avoid paying fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:20:59
Redditor for 6 days, only ever posted against BTC... I don't think you ever owned a single satoshi and are salty about it :p
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:10:25
No problem, welcome aboard :) you can learn more about exchanges/wallets etc. You will feel more comfortable with price fluctuations if you know morw about the history/tech as wekk

€500 here, not arrived
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:47:04
Lol, most would say it's smart to buy when it drops. Just don't buy everything at one price, or you will probably miss the dip
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:19:05
It's a pump obviously, they want to manipulate the new guys
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:27:05
I think you can buy from anycoindirect without many verifications

Ik ken er ondertussen wel een aantal, het groeit. En bedankt!
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:40:05
Short term, probably. Long term, buy a hardware wallet or make a paper wallet
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:02:08
Actually I meant making a whole new temporary wallet. Because if you would ever lose your ledger you can't recover with your pin. Better safe than sorry
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:06:21
For me it's when I graduate and have to buy a place to live probably

They still owe me €500... So I'll keep using it untill they add the €500 to my account

I don't get it, what are those futures? ELI5 please (English is not my native language) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:08:17
You shouldn't gamble with 60% of your total worth... And you are not adding 10% to your bitcoin, but you bitcoin becomes 10% pore valuable.

If you have a paper wallet (takes 15 minutes) you can use Anycoindirect. They have higher fees most of the time but you buy them into your wallet immediately 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:53:35
Crap, I was not far from a withdrawal :/ 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:36:13
Trading Times: 6PM to 5PM (Sun-Fri) Central Time (CST)
So when will the first future be available on CME?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:27:05
Do your own research? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:22:31
If you bought at anycoindirect you could have had the chance to buy at 10k :p
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:21:33
It actually isn't indeed, 10% is nothing if we still are +10% since 3 days :p

I don't need fees :p so the minimum. I'll try yo set up one later today :)

Thanks for the answers so far. I will check the video later :)
I'd like to open a channel for fun and leave it open for a while. But if I don't 'advertise' my channel, will it be used? 
@_date: 2018-08-19 17:24:36
Thank you for making that! Is this only for people that seek to receive or do payments on the lightning network? Or will people use my channel randomly?
I don't really get how it works yet, sorry :) I don't get why I should pay BTC to open a channel. Will I get it back? Earn something with it? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:07:02
Thank you so much. So people who made the futures want the price to go in their favor, and people fear that many will try to lower the prize 
@_date: 2019-03-04 10:33:19
Imagine I know some merchants who might consider Bitcoin payments. Can I set up my own lighting node and route their transactions via my node while still using BTCPayserver?
What happens when my node loses connection, can they still do transactions? 
@_date: 2019-03-06 10:49:36
What happens with volume if you leave out stable coins? Or even only USDT
@_date: 2019-03-12 10:52:12
On the other hand, bitcoin is already 10 years old
@_date: 2018-10-13 23:18:22
They should create a lightning network channel to pay for them :D
@_date: 2018-10-14 21:41:10
Yeah, I had a brainfart. It's 2140, sorry about that
@_date: 2018-10-13 23:17:36
Can't they do an update and accept it since they own all the hashrate? And that update allows you to do creepy stuff?
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:46:03
And internet was harder to 'distribute'
@_date: 2018-10-14 11:31:10
You're about to go full retard I believe. Or you're just a troll :p
@_date: 2018-10-14 10:57:22
No it can't, it is fixed. You can perfectly calculate when the last bitcoin will be mined

@_date: 2018-10-14 08:08:02
Isn't 2040 the year the last btc will be mined? 
@_date: 2018-10-12 17:30:03
Why not? (genuine question)

Thanks for the great explanation :)
@_date: 2018-06-19 01:32:52
Ah man, I'm starting to love watching his talks. Most of us (including me) started with crypto to make more money than we have. But he explains so well why it's needed for some groups of people that I'm nearly ashamed I didn't understood this earlier and just put money in it hoping it would return more.
I whish I could reproduce his words better to convince other people why crypto is needed
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:49:12
If you lost your seed but have access to the ledger I would temporarily move your BTC to a paper wallet. Reset the ledger and start over with a new seed.
That seed is the most important thing there is

You went back in time for this? How does it work? What's the past like? Did you buy btc? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:14:30
Okey, I guess I'll keep my paper wallet then. Buy a Ledger/Trezor and start over again. I'm still not sure which one to buy, but I want a hardware wallet over a paper one
@_date: 2019-02-16 16:29:54
And when the total reaches that 100 dollars it does an onchain transaction? Or how does it work
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:59:38
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:37:36
Buy in bits as it lowers, but you should also buy in bits as it rises. Don't spend more if you can't afford to lose it though. If you think you'll need the money in less than a few months you shouldn't invest it in Bitcoin

Are there transaction costs for sending bitcoin from one wallet to another? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:50:24
I have a paper wallet now, do I have to pay transaction fees to send it to a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:52:58

@_date: 2017-11-17 22:08:48
Just tell here you have around 400k worth of bitcoin. Propose to sell 350k for the house now and hodl te rest for the future of your kid. Why would you own money when your not doing anything with it?
Do you prefer keeping it until you are old and die with it?

How would you mine it? I have a Nexus 5X, known for boot loops. I already have a new phone but I'd like to keep using the Nexus for something so that it will bootloop eventually.
I'm letting it run a game now from time to time but I might as well mine with it

@_date: 2018-11-06 11:34:09
Why wouldn't they use their technology first for a while before selling? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:36:45
It could send it to another address and display the address you want to send to (on the the app, some are to lazy to check on device

@_date: 2019-01-16 23:47:55
Thanks for the link! That's indeed what I'm looking for (PoS + node). 120 euros is not cheap, but I guess it's reasonable for what it does. I know a very skilled programmer, also with Linux, he might be able to help me with BTCPay server. Will have to ask though, if it doesn't exist it might be because it's very hard...
I was planning to give it as a 'gift' to my friend who owns the place, but 120 is already a very pricy gift to my standards :p 
@_date: 2019-01-13 00:05:07
Oh damn, yeah I would prefer it to be on a paper. I think it's rather dull to hang up a screen with just a qr code. There's not many people buying those snacks anyway.
Anyway, do you know if it's possible to run a ln node on a pi + connect a screen to it for the qr code? Than it might be a cool addition to show the capabilities of the raspberry pi (there are biweekly events for kids to work with arduino/pi/... 
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:11:02
No, you can have milli sats as well (or at least in the near future you will) 
@_date: 2019-01-21 10:55:43
Would be cool if I could pay automatically by clicking or so. Not sure, it's pretty cool!
Might use my lightning network tips I got here in Reddit for it ��
It's pretty cool you're running your own LN node as well! 
@_date: 2019-01-01 15:48:04
Do you know anything about coin.ik? I did a random Google search and that came out of it.
I never used localbitcoins (but I just buy on coinbase pro) and the person I'm sending to is a real tech noob so easily scammed I'm afraid 
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:00:10
Damn, more clicks! �� 
@_date: 2019-01-02 15:07:36

I read it as 150k, annoying as f in spreadsheets :p

@_date: 2019-01-24 14:33:54
You just allow digits behind the dot. It's just a string of code telling you 0.00...1 is the minimum 
@_date: 2019-01-02 18:10:50
Ooh sorry man, I thought you ment the exchange Coinbase - -'
Got it now thanks for the education 
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:23:46
I don't own the shop though :p but I don't mind posting their link if they accept Bitcoin, and are willing to listen to feedback.
Created this post to show you should always encourage merchants to use good services.
They will now try Coingate instead of bitpay, so I achieved my goal. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 15:32:44
Really? Didn't know that, sorry
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:43:57
Tell something about lightning network, or a lightning node approximately 5000 times on this sub. You'll get enough in tips!
Also, what on earth do you need 50 cents for  
@_date: 2019-01-17 19:46:05
Many now famous investors stayed under the radar first, or moved to other countries. Since the world is so connected that's not so easy anymore. It's not extremely rare 
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:50:48
That's a great start, Thanks! More expensive then I thought though
@_date: 2019-01-02 15:04:24
What would you advice for a tech noob. Localbitcoins or coin.ik? I might have to check out localbitcoins myself to see how it works.
I think it's best if I let him make an account on an exchange, and use a shared pass so I can just accept, convert and send the LKR to him. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:01:56
Ok, read that. But why can't institutional investors buy on Coinbase for example? I really don't get it
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:11:14
But if it contains a virus, won't it affect the storage? And then also the device I want to play it on (my computer)? 
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:43:38
Alright, I see why an institution might want this then. Doesn't sound very cool to me though, BAKKT will then hold a huge amount of BTC which is IMO pretty bad.
But hooray for the price I guess?
Split between making money and making Bitcoin good

Your data is off dude
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:25:08
Gold is finite. So it can't be mined faster forever. At one point it has to decrease is speed. Pretty sure we reached that point, or are close to it
@_date: 2019-01-24 18:40:43
If you had one bitcoin before, you'll still have one bitcoin if they made the smallest unit smaller. It will be worth the same.
Or do I see that wrong? 
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:48:05
Wow, he explained some use cases. And then explained the self fulfilling prophecy! Almost there I guess
@_date: 2019-01-21 02:07:06
4% is a great price for cash to bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:52:31
The mining speed of gold had it's peak. There aren't popping up as many new mining spots anymore, and the old ones are running out of gold faster than you think.
Nearly all of the mining spots that are currently being mind are from before 2000, and they'll run dry before an equal amount of other mines are being found
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:36:40
Can I buy a raspberry pi, and set up a node for someone else without having to deposit BTC in it?
@_date: 2019-01-12 16:47:35
Yeah, it's a cool place. There aren't many people, and it's just paying for snacks/drinks.
The main purpose of the makerspace isn't selling stuff. It's a place where you can 3d pint, lasercut, work on arduino,... 
@_date: 2019-01-19 14:26:24
Maybe because none of these guesses have a source? You're just a guy making assumptions, might as well put a price prediction on it.
I heavily support BTC, but I hate it when people put dates in stuff randomly. Probably people will ask why X is not reached in June 2019
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:53:06
I think I start to understand it throughout the thread :) thanks! 
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:32:42
Soft fork, so regular software update (no split in chain)
Edit: apparently you can't, sorry
@_date: 2019-01-12 14:25:20
It's basically him owning the place, he manages everything on his own. No additional staff.
Satoshi value is cool indeed, but I was wondering if a qr code can change the value it asks.
Otherwise I might try a screen with a raspberry pi, and combine that with the lightning node. But a paper is so much easier �� 
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:26:12
Bitcoin obviously... Might check back here once in a while though ;)
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:49:56
Apparently 500GB is enough :)  
@_date: 2019-01-13 01:56:37
Thanks for the help and suggestions so far. Casa is not an option, to expensive for what it will be used for, than I'd rather follow a tutorial to use the raspberry pi + screen :)
I'm having a week of in February, so might be a good time to do it (with the help of this sub ��) 
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:54:40
It might bring us faster to completely empty mines, so I'm pretty sure the faster the price rises, the faster we will see the clear decline.
A price spike doesn't mean a new mining possibility is created. You're talking about next years, so not short term. So I indeed say the supply will not increase at a faster rate than it is today 
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:15:50
Yeah why not? Software updates are possible for things like this 
@_date: 2019-01-25 09:18:23
You've been giving fake tips for a while now. Might want to stop that, or reload your tipping address 
@_date: 2019-01-21 07:28:27
It's not true. Most require at least a minimum of verification 
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:07:19
Yeah, that's what I do as well while writing. It's unusual to use dots or comma's where I live.
I just said that I saw the benefit over using nothing (because that's just hard to read :p) 
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:19:43

So bakkt is a way for institutions to buy and store bitcoin? If that's it than I'm not sure why there was such a hype for it.
You might as well buy a ledger and transfer everything into a wallet they control themselves 
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:55:28
I don't really know how to use Github, I only use it to download software from. Never communicated with it.

No he didn't, what's your source? 
@_date: 2019-01-24 16:23:56
Very clear, thanks! 
@_date: 2019-01-25 09:19:05
Brave? I use brave :D how do I use your tab? Never installed one on Brave
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:15:39
I see the benefits though. 58352000 becomes hard to read :p
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:57:34
Read these 3 articles, it's absurd to believe that supply will always follow demand... If anything it's the other way around, because of the high demand, they mine as fast as possible. Doesn't mean they'll find gold forever :p

Where did you steal this meme from? 2017?
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:51:53
I meant a lightning node sorry.

BAKKT holds actual Bitcoin for institutions instead of CBOE handing out papers with the value of BTC. Is that correct?
So CBOE doesn't need to have Bitcoin? Or is that where that 3rd party warehouse comes in?
Thanks for the explanation, sad I'm not used to commodities and stuff
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:28:10
Huh, but what has coinbase to do with it? 
@_date: 2018-11-05 15:26:03
Fake transactions. They just send btc to themselves so it looks like there are transactions of others 
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:19:00
I see, thanks for clearing that up

We should make another spike in the data!

Everybody is a bot except you
@_date: 2018-12-30 21:16:33
I use Revolut :) it's all I need
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:28:14
This one time, bitcoin went up to $1000... and it craaaaaashed all the way to $800
@_date: 2018-12-26 14:47:46
Then it stays on your wallet created by the ln bot
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:39:19
Probably a stupid question, but a LN is useless of there is no bitcoin on it right? I would love to help spreading the network, but I don't feel comfortable putting my own btc on it
@_date: 2018-12-10 10:13:42
Gonna keep some to play around :D
!lntip 500 :)

Why buy a ledger before you think about buying crypto? I mean, you should have made up your mind before buying the ledger...
Anyway, good luck with your investments

Core will increase block size if there is no other solution possible. But at the moment there are still ways to make block space more efficient.
Someone else can explain why bigger blocks is not good, I'm on mobile now
@_date: 2018-12-26 11:04:48
Jeej, tipping contest �� 
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:39:51
Yeah I know, but just to help the network grow :) I always postponed it
@_date: 2018-12-23 10:18:31
Wait, did I missed something in the news? 
@_date: 2018-12-10 09:21:35
Can I give tips back with this bot without doing anything special?
@_date: 2018-12-31 09:09:14
You can buy/sell crypto on Revolut for sure. I'm sure you can also send it, but I never tried
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:10:34
Haha so cool :) thanks 
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:47:50
Wow, that's great! Thanks :)
I need to set up a node now
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:24:04
You have the same amount of bitcoin though, prices will rise again, no worries
