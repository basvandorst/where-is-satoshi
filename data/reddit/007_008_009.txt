I think it's not the problem of storing it electronically, but to keep the storage location in secret. If I say on public forum that I keep priv keys on a piece of paper in a bank's deposit box, then it's unlikely anyone will think about stealing the funds (depending on the amount of course). But, if you talk too much to your chat "friends" and disclose your methods of storing coins, then some day you may discover not all of them were your friends actually.

I guess this is going to be a problem at some point in the future due to "contentious something" that will prevent to reach consensus
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:17:54
and what else are you going to force this way? Schnorr, and then what... ? are you going to leave anything that will look like Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:16:19






Are you sure Bitcoin (and blockchain in general) is for you?
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:16:32
How did the hacker know you store your credentials on evernote?

Your opinion clearly shows that replay protection in Bitcoin Cash was bad idea. Without replay protection the whole ecosystem could just use better version immediately. However, I do hope you guys will not follow 2X part of Segwit2X, and we'll see massive exodus to big blocks chain.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:42:46
Bitcoin Cash is old good Bitcoin with big blocks (without Segwit and RBF). Bitcoin Core (aka Bitcoin Segwit, or Witcoin) is Bitcoin with changed mechanics, ie. block size was changed to block weight, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:15:33
Not sure if it's disadvantage, but with Segwit your witnesses will be segregated
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:15:08
Yeah, riiiight... What was its valid thru date?
@_date: 2017-08-09 08:49:26
You haven't noticed Bitcoin Cash yet, have you? It's doing pretty well 
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:08:07
LN payment is like sending banknotes through a tube between people sitting at the same table. What is the advantage for regular users comparing to regular on-chain transactions?
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:31:30
hash power doesn't matter for them - they'll secure their chain on twitter
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:59:35
What if Bitcoin Cash will become more valuable than SegWitcoin in the next months/years?
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:55:31
There's no need to raise the block size. Segwit is almost there, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:43:18
And more concerns from another user 
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:21:16


@_date: 2017-08-28 08:59:25
Also, exchanges use flat withdrawal fees without any calculations
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:46:44
Can someone elaborate on this please?


@_date: 2017-08-10 15:33:22


note that it's important that full node is non-mining one because hash power doesn't matter, so the node must not mine anything
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:29:29
It probably won't work with hundreds/thousands/millions of open channels, so mining will be required at some point, right?
What about the risks? For instance, not broadcasting in time 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:45:25
Without S2X you would never have your Segwit activated, and UASF would split the network anyway
@_date: 2017-04-20 12:04:46
why not equal prices for both sides then?
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:01:07
It's covert R&amp;D in China - based on 7 nm manufacturing process they're going to introduce DTR-based electron shifting between transistor junctions that will lead to 40-50% speed up of hash function computations. I'm afraid you will need to reverse engineer it (like AsicBoost) and fix it asap in one of the future versions.
@_date: 2017-04-10 06:24:28
at last, mens sana
@_date: 2017-04-07 11:33:30
Don't forget about a fix for 7 nm junctions DTR-based accelerated bus that is being secretly developed in southern China
@_date: 2017-04-04 12:44:35
Not sure why putting transactions in another block type would be better than extending capacity of regular blocks
@_date: 2017-04-07 10:45:55
You should also request to remove the differences in electricy pricing for all. All miners should have the same price, hardware, costs, etc. And I guess you want them to wear the same uniforms don't you?
@_date: 2017-04-19 14:49:10
and one of them is the prices on slide 9
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:32:36
There's nothing certain about HF for base block size increase. Don't forget Luke-jr's proposal to decrease the block size first and proceed with 17% increases over next years which can be more likely than HFs to 2/4/8. GM seems to be in favor of dynamic block size rather than multiple HFs.


incentive-aligned dynamic block size controls based on allowing miners to produce larger blocks at some cost.
and also 


scaling, while building additional tools that would make bandwidth
increases safer long term. Further work will prepare Bitcoin for further
increases, which will become possible when justified, while also providing
the groundwork to make them justifiable.
Those are vague promises similar to HK agreement rather than roadmap.

So, you think rbtc was created because they didn't want to express their views here?
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:14:18
Yes, thank you!
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:46:20
What's your point? told you what to do - after moving coins somewhere else nobody can steal them. Simple.
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:59:57
Why not? Thieves are everywhere but you don't have to care about all of them - just keep your assets in a safe place.
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:37:44
A transparent resourcefulness globally generates the simplification, while the initiators stay on trend. Scaling and cross-pollination impact calibrations going forward. The community accelerates the cross-functional, re-imagined, global footprint. The turn-key correlations solutionize outstanding, result-driven, generic and cultural mindshares. First and foremost, a correlation efficiently promotes options.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:37:25
They avoid hardfork based updates at all cost, since it allows them to maintain status quo, ie. defining Bitcoin as per they needs. In case of team split, those who will stay with non-hardforked version will be in charge. With 2 softforked versions, those with better propaganda will win.
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:59:24
Yes, and additionally **IF** BCC will gain traction and become more valuable, then your digital currency value (represented by BTC only) can be significantly lower
@_date: 2017-07-03 13:21:03
I doubt they don't know the fees could be lower now, so apparently they are making additional money
@_date: 2017-07-11 08:37:42
BIP148 doesn't need hashpower
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:56:14


I thought hashrate doesn't matter, and the node count is the key
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:01:40
it depends on the number of hubs - the more hubs, the more competition. What if there was one hub only? Wouldn't it be the power of monopoly?
@_date: 2017-07-13 07:15:04
Yes, it is.
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:34:11
UASF tries to fundamentally change Bitcoin and it doesn't have overwhelming community support - why is it discussed in this sub?
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:17:15
Didn't talk to you... Whistle and the dogs will holler, huh...?
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:47:08


@_date: 2017-07-14 11:10:49
The expected result from adopting segwit is support for as many low fee transactions as possible (through LN and increased block capacity). Does it mean that bitcoin will be worth less than today? What if LN will actually lead to centralization via payment hubs, and specialised commercial dev team(s)?
@_date: 2017-07-16 08:49:28
Your posts are pure manipulation
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:31:26


excessive exultation over one's success or achievements (used especially in a political context)
@_date: 2017-06-17 07:17:29
Long term, if fees will be pushed out of the mainchain, and the block rewards go~~es~~ close to zero, what will be incentivizing miners? Will fees from LN channels be enough?
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:58:28
So what would you suggest? Are they dumb? Or just don't care for their customers' money, or what's wrong with them?
