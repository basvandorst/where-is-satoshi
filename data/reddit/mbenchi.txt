If we want bitcoin to become a Store of value or an actual "electronic cash system", we should get others use to seeing value in BTC directly.

Verifiy with each address without losing privacy. This would be a in depth operation, even if it ends up saving 100,000 BTCs its worth a lot of money that can push the network forward, give a piece of mind to miners and help needed citizens.

Also, at this stage it cannot work below $5000 as that is the average price to mine a bitcoin worldwide.

Blockchain tech is fully relevant to Bitcoin price. People have to understand the blockchain to understand more why it goes up and down.
