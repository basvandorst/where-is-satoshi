You don't have to.  You can create a paper-wallet, and just scan the public key to receive funds.  Then you can scan the private key to send funds.

The price isn't steadily increasing.  It's really volatile.  I'm sure the price will rise this year, but it might fall this week.  
That's going to worry most people.

This sounds more tedious than the system it replaces.  It is also more expensive.

Mine was immediate.  Your university might not be supported yet.  Shoot them an email, and they're likely to add it.

Uh huh...
