Hmm, that's a lot of money. In case you are right thank you for the research. It's incredibly concerning and exciting at the same time. But if you don't mind me wondering. Why did you create an account three days ago and everything you post here has been related to this? I believe that everyone has an incentive, what's yours?

Happens with cash... No big deal.

Well if you could print unlimited cash notes you wouldn't be on this forum.
Yes the value will go up per Satoshi, because there is less in circulation.
Other than that the losing of money as a principle is no big deal to society.
Oh and I wish I was 15, because if I would'v invested back then, life would be easier.

Upped your comment because of this.

That means that fiat is being printed faster than BTC if I'm correct. So that means you get more money for your BTC later in time. Buying power \^.

"But Bitcoin has so far failed at its goal of becoming a new kind of digital cash, which was the ambition described in the original documentation. So far, almost the only thing Bitcoin has been used for is a speculative commodity, like a digital gold, with lots of trading on the price. (The one place where Bitcoin has been used for regular real transactions is in the black markets.)"
The black market thing is a cheap comment. Other than that they are implying that gold is no real use case, which I find fascinating. The rest of the article isn't too bad though, the ending is fair.
"Now there are lots of serious people paying attention to Bitcoin and everything that has spun out from it — the latest blockchain research center is about to be opened by professors at Stanford University. All those serious people make solving problems a lot easier."

Remind me in another two years.

Good to have a realistic approach to this. However, I think that the use of BTC is different than fiat now. It's more like gold and in the way of gold, it's easier to trade, always available, safer and harder to steal. It is hard to give it intrinsic value though, I agree. I've read articles about the average mining fee being the bottom, but I'm not too sure about that. 
This bear market might last for a while, but it will see another uptrend. Why? The smartest people I know are working on solutions, products or companies within this space. If you find it hard to have trust in the concept, trust these people.

Becuase of the harder to grasp intrinsic value I think the market cycles will be more exaggerated. However, BTC has in my eyes proven its self as a store of value already. The hype surrounding BTC can only be pushed so far. Other projects need to carry this on to show the diversity and future of the tech, this, in turn, will boost BTC again.
