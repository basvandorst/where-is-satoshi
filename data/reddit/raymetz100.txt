My favorite quote from the article...
 "And in real life, the Petro – crypto or not – doesn’t exist at all. “We have not seen a single Petro circulating, nor its smart contracts, or rules of the token, and much less its blockchain,” says Farias"

The petro crypto doesn't exist.  To my knowledge no common person can buy, hold, or sell it and there is no blockchain explorer or exchange that has Petro crypto.  It might exist on a private network somewhere.  I hope I'm wrong but I haven't seen any government crypto yet.  I have seen a bunch of fake crypto named petro with no daily transactions in the block explorer.  That is not real government Petro though.
Post a link to a block explorer if there really is government Petro.  I'd love to see it

USD is retained on exit...  If you want more USD, then don't bother with BTC.
I have enough USD so I bought some BTC.  My BTC will not convert to USD while it's in my possession.

Sorry to hear you live in Venezuela.  In my country the USA, Fiat was working well long before I was born.  Chances are US fiat will continue working well long after I'm dead.
I've been buying BTC monthly for over 5 years now.  By percentage of circulating supply owned, I own about 100x more BTC than USD.  That's not because I trust BTC more, it's because BTC is dirt cheap compared to USD and likely always will be.
I also like BTC because I've been a programmer for the last 35 years.  I love the geekyness of BTC and I can't say the same for USD.  I hope BTC surpasses USD someday, but I don't expect it to.
I spent Monero for a Fortnight shirt a couple days ago.  Do you spend BTC on anything besides altcoin and USD?  I know a lot of people that only like BTC for it to increase in value and have no intention of using it ever other than to cash it back for more USD.  I spit on those people (here on Reddit anyway)

I'm verified now.  I think what did it was swithdrawing $40 to my bank account, which forced me to register with my bank.  Once that was done, I became verified without contacting support.
Or it was just concidence

I've been waiting for verification since Feb 1st, 2 weeks ago.

Who did you contact?  I'm not a twitter user.  I converted my BTC to cash and withdrew everything.  I added my bank account for the withdrawal, maybe that will speed up the verification.
I'd like to try buying BTC there again and sending it to a non-exchange wallet.

6ft 280lbs.  I ran a full 26.2mi marathon last summer in 5hrs 30 mins.  I love to eat.  Tonight's dinner bill with my son was $120 on the bitpay card.  He is large too.

I'll try any popular technology and not pick sides.  If there was another debit Visa card to try on any other coin or vendor besides bitpay, I'll try that too.  I own 230 different brand altcoins.  None of them have a Visa debit card available though.  If you don't like bitpay, promote an alternative.  They seem ok to me so far.  I also like BIP70 and not having to copy .0001289 when I make a purchase.
I thought BIP70 was the devil when I first studied it.  Then I used it.  Kind of like women and beer I guess.
I'm using BTC every week now.  I used to buy $100/week of ETH for alt coin purchases.  Now I buy $500/week of BTC and send most of it to BitPay for reataurants and gas.  Pick your poison.
Next steps are paying rent with crypto, getting my paychecks as crypto, and not using cash.  I'm sure you will find something each of those companies are doing wrong too.

Cash app does not have the lowest price.  It is $0 fees and a higher price.  If you buy, then sell, then buy, then sell in cash app you will lose about 10%.  If you do the same on Coinbase Pro or Binance, the difference between buy and sell is about .1% so 4x trades will cost you about 1% .  Much better than Cash app.  Don't be fooled by zero fees.  The more important thing to look for is volume which makes the buy/sell spread smaller.
I agree cash app is easy for beginners.  I paid 9% on my last trade because it was at Safeway grocery store and I spent $10 for $9 of bitcoin.  I was happy to lose a dollar for the experience.  I have used and will use Cash app again too.  If you want low prices look for the highest volume exchanges like Coinbase Pro and Binance.

LN is not bitcoin.  I can't receive LN without paying a 3rd party yet.  How would I withdraw from a LN exchange?  LN is great if you like sending bitcoin to others.  It's poor if you want to receive bitcoin.  If you are a million dollar business then you can receive LN for cheap.  If you are like me I would need a 24/7 internet connection, a $300 Casa node, and an external drive.  Counting Internet fees, that's $500 just to receive 10 satoshi over LN.  Then what happens when my Internet goes down?  If someone tries to send me LN with my node offline, I think it stops their transaction.  That's because LN isn't a duplicated ledger like BTC and doesn't store transactions.
There is a long list of other blockchains with low fees and high speed similar to LN.  For a consumer sending transactions under $10, Ripple, ETH, Stellar, TRON, and Dash would all be good options.  The price doesn't peg to BTC, but who cares if you balance is less than $50.  For the companies receiving 1000s of small transactions, I agree they will enable LN.  They will also accept Ripple, ETH, Stellar, TRON, and Dash or make their own.
Either way, there is no chance that near 100% of all bitcoin use will be LN.  I do think it's possible that daily LN transaction counts could be higher than daily BTC transactions, but no matter how popular LN is, I'd expect BTC to keep over 90% of the dollars transferred.  Since LN isn't 2 way, $$ transferred will be one direction from users to 3rd parties.  Those 3rd parties aren't going to re-transmit it in LN.  Where would they send it to?  There isn't much point in resending to themselves.  Even an exchange accepting LN would charge them more than just closing out the channel to their own BTC account.  So $$ transferred per day for LN = $ transferred per day for BTC, then normal BTC transactions go above that.
Once LN is two way for cheap like other blockchains, then most of the comments above will change.  I hope that day comes soon.

Exodus is for newbs.  Great for newbs though.
