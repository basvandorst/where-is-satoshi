Yeah, it's almost as if they're willing to pay hundreds of dollars to hold onto 1 of these! Who woulda thought?

Megafake. I wonder who's behind all these posts recently.

He went after "Magic the Gathering Exchange" acronym pretty fast

Geez, if this is is for real, BC price will explode once source is out and it's off testnet.
Good job..

This is called an order book, it will show you who wants to buy and for how much: 
So, you're wrong.

I added a few write-ups to the Counterparty subreddit: 
So far I have simple Windows write-ups on how to send and receive XCP, as well as how to place buy/sell orders on the DEx using the command line.

No, not at all.

What if you never send the money and let the timer run out? The seller will just lose 2 BTC escrow for no reason?

My goal was to make checkout extremely easy and to reduce steps to a bare minimum. I assure you that my order tracking works great with this system! 
I receive payment and simply match the decimals to an order number. Magneto keeps track of the order numbers.
But you're right, if this system doesn't work out then I'll switch it to the mtgox payment processor and remove the excessive checkout steps.

Yes I've thought of using bitcoind, but would be much more comfortable if wallet wasn't hosted online. I think 0.001 BTC is a small fee to pay for security (~0.01$). The beta version of this site was actually running a checkout process which generated an address for each order using the bitcoind installation on the server, in the end I decided to use the current method instead.

Well that was nice, except for the horrible mispronunciation of Bitcoin at the end

How does he snatch $120 from you by knocking you down? Was he bigger than you? Were you holding your cash in hand while walking down the street? How exactly did it happen?
I ask so that others might avoid the same behavior.
@_date: 2013-07-28 19:28:16
Damn where'd you get that?
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:55:58
Looks like they're from the Kevin O'Leary school of business, LOL
DRAIN DRAIN DRAIN all that cashflow away.

I've been regularly leasing proxies from  for a good 8 months now. No interruption, works with streaming, and they're passworded with IP authentication.

It probably sent to a change address that you own. Log into your MyWallet through blockchain.info and run an integrity check.
Same issue happened to me, integrity check fixed it.

You have to make an account on  and then paste your address into the thread here: 
Only paste your address without anything else in the thread. The bot will send you the Ripples when it reaches your spot in the queue. It takes between 2-6 hours to get your first Ripples, so msg me when you receive them and are ready to sell!
