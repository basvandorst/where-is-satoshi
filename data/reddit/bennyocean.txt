There was another post on this forum where someone posted that they were asked at a party what they do for a living, and his answer was "I stare at candles and move coins around" with no further explanation. I think that's a lot of people on this board.

I've come to the conclusion that there's no sense trying to explain crypto to 'normies'. Hell, I barely understand it. In my humble opinion, anyone making money off Bitcoin or the cryptosphere in general should just refer to themselves as 'traders' or 'investors' and leave it at that. Most people don't want to hear about it and couldn't understand it if you tried to explain it to them. Also, if the coins spike in value more than they already have, you don't want everyone in your personal life knowing what you're worth.

I was still buying between 16 and 18k... now I just wish I'd held on to more cash so I could buy the dips. When it peaks to $19k which it did last week, $16-$18k can feel like a dip but I guess hindsight is 20/20. It's all a learning experience.

As a bit of perspective, I went back to school in 2010 and had to go over $20k in debt to finish my degree. If I'd invested $1000 of that money in BTC back then and skipped the degree, I don't think I need to tell you I'd be better off now than I am with a Bachelor's degree.

If I had to guess, insiders with a huge stake in both BTC and BCH dumped a bunch of BTC and bought *coins they already owned* from themselves at inflated prices, to jack up the perceived market value of BCH. Seems like a pretty dopey idea to me, and it will benefit BTC in the long run if the shady 'whales' all dump their BTC and let the market behave in a natural manner. If the whales don't have the BTC to throw around, they can't manipulate the market like this.

Do some research. BTC is actually priced well right now. ETH and LTC are near their all-time highs, so you don't normally want to buy a coin while it's peaking.

Next time someone says Bitcoin (or crypto in general) is a ponzi/pyramid/bubble... ask them to explain crypto. Then ask them to explain what causes market bubbles. 
Most people who say Bitcoin is a bubble don't know anything about crypto or market bubbles or economics in general. They're just repeating nonsense they've heard. In other words, they're talking out of their asses, and they should be called out on it.

I'll use the case of the 2008 housing bubble/collapse. You had an extended period of low interest rates, inflated appraisals, and aggressive lending practices, including adjustable-rate (ARM) loans. With traditional home loans, you'd need a 20% down payment. Back then we had people borrowing 100% to buy a house. So when/if the interest rate rises and/or the value of their home takes a dive, they are 'upside-down', owing more than their home is worth. As soon as a buyer owes more on their home than the property is worth, they have every reason to walk away, and that's what happened en masse. 
That's a pretty simple breakdown. A similar breakdown could be done for the student loan bubble. Students have borrowed much more than they can repay because the jobs they're getting when leaving school, for the most part, don't pay that well. I hope that explains a little bit.

There could be multiple big corrections per day. What's about to happen is unprecedented. I jokingly told a coworker that with the addition of the futures market, Bitcoin is about to be 'volatility squared'. I think that's correct, but as a coin holder, I wouldn't sweat it. Just buy the dips, and if you're brave, sell a bit at the peaks to play the margin game.

Do your own research, it's a complicated question. If you're going to to put a little money on cryptos other than BTC, I'd just pick the 3 or 4 most traded and put even money on each of them. Some of them might go to zero but if one goes up 1000% or more, you make money. With an upside like that, you only need to be right once... like investing in BTC in 2010 or 2011. Small investment goes a long way.

You might want to sell a partial coin and wait and see if it gets higher. I think a smart strategy is sell a tenth of a coin at 17k. Wait to see if it goes higher and sell another tenth etc. No reason you have to do it all at once.
I made this mistake as a buyer and now regret it. Better to watch how things to and do it in pieces rather than all at once.
It hit 19k last week. Maybe it'll go well over 20k this week and you might have the opportunity to make way more selling that coin, if you're determined to sell it. Frankly, I think this is a terrible time to sell. This thing seems primed to do some insane things over the next few weeks.

For clarity, the white bars on top right are dips to as low as $7864. The smaller white lines on bottom right track the frequency of trading. For some reason, it appears to have been rapidly traded for a short spurt, with rapid fluctuations from the high $7000's to the low $9000's. Very unusual.

It was $1352 this time last year and about $450 in April '16. $9659 as of the time of this posting. So from April '16 to April '17 the price roughly tripled. From April '17 to April '18 it went up 7x.
If we don't want to get too optimistic, we'd say that the multiple will be somewhere between 3x and 7x. This puts us somewhere between $29k and $67k. 
Of course... Bitcoin is weird and very volatile. So it could be some other crazy number way outside my estimate. If I was going to guess where we'd be around the end of the year, I'd say somewhere between 30-40k, but take that with a grain of salt.
