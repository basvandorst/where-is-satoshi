I'm really bad at memes, so I made 4 hoping that together they are as good as other people's 1 :)

pretty much. that is gribble though. so to authenticate with him - you need to have a private encryption key and be able to decrypt a slightly different message the bot sends you on each auth attempt. gribble4lyfe.

As long as they do the exact same checks as cash/credit/check but in the end say "here is where you send the BTC to" I don't see this being a problem. I imagine if I walked into a pawn shop/gun dealer and did all the legal checks then wanted to play with silver or gold - they'd let me, they'd probably just want to adjust spot price depending on what form I have the currency in (coins, raw nugs, precious scrap, etc). 
If you can pay for guns in cash, I don't see why not BTC.

Favorite story right there.

Just google bitcoin-otc or join us on freenode in  there are plenty of reputable traders and sometimes someone playing the long game will sell legitimate coins below market price.

Mt. Gox. Lawdy lawdy. I've had it take up to 24 hours to get my coins from them. 
Part of me thinks it is because of how bogged down they are. The other part of me thinks it is on purpose so you don't go bouncing BTC from exchange to exchange to ride the price delta between them.

yeah they are hungry as fck. 80,000 BTC? What is going on here. Is the US Gov't printing out money and buying up all the BTC in an attempt to quell the cryptocurrency uprising!?!?!?

Looks like Bitcoin Advertisers charges based on the hits? And you got ~1500 hits at one point? Their rate for text links is 0.005 BTC, so it cost you 7.5BTC (~$50) to have 1500 individuals driven to your site? Am I getting this right? 
@_date: 2012-07-14 23:24:51
I am! Right now I just trade it back and forth for btc or usd. But I did purchase a $10 amazon gift card a while back with some.

Most likely. But also, the latest NEW NEW post there is 7 days old. So I mean, I have to wonder, what other posts for bitmarket trading are waiting? Maybe the mod should think about adding a few other people from [or something, just so the market place can be more real-time.

...and ye and behold, on the 5th comment the 13 year olds of the internet did realize they could now purchase cigarettes in private through bit coins.

Gotta get that hype! 
@_date: 2013-02-18 01:58:04
Now imagine if you had gotten that BTC when it was $8 dollars and didn't cash it out until today.

unless an actual accountant/tax resource comes into this thread - I'd suggest calling up either the IRS with a "hypothetical question for class" or  a place like HR Block (whatever) and just saying "hey I already filed my taxes...but I sold a bunch of digital goods for cash and...". I wouldn't bother trying to tell them the whole bitcoin story - just tell them they were in-game items or something for a massive digital game. I mean, one could in theory stretch the truth to fit that explanation. 
For all we know Master Satoshi is sitting on his throne, waiting for the day to crash our game back to the floor.

I will *always* back 1 BTC against 1 toz of gold. Now, if you don't mind - I'll buy your gold from you at the goodness-of-my-heart price of 2btc per toz. Just because I like you guys :: pinches your chipmunk cheeks ::

Lol, ITT we learn r/bitcoin doesn't get sarcasm. we all know one day bitcoin will surpass an oz of gold!

Yeah OP try litecoins for a few days and let us know what you get there. with btc-e conversions it might be more profitable to mine ltc then trade for btc
