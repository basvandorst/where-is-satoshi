I think I might have to go with MtGox since they offer Dwolla. Have you used Dwolla with MtGox? If I remember correctly there where some issues between the two a while back.

Well it's both, I didn't feel like going through the hassle of creating a Dwolla account in order to save 75 cents per transfer. Now Paxum which seems to be the other cheap alternative is like 6 dollars by the time it hits my bank account PLUS the hassle of dealing with Paxum.
With ExchB all I had to do is send the funds via ACH and I would have them in my bank account ready to be spent in 3-4 days with no extra steps in between for only 1 dollar, cheap and convenient.

I'm sure he meant USPS Money Orders as per their FAQ

You mentioned Dwolla being a little slow. I don't mind the initial setup being slow I just don't want to wait a week or two before my money hits my bank account each time I do a transfer. How slow is that process for you if you don't mind me asking.

I didn't feel like creating a whole new account with someone else and jumping through another step in order to withdraw the money. I just created a Dwolla account and now I have to send a picture of an ID to open the account, oh well.

I really don't need to deposit money to buy bitcoins since I'm only selling but are you talking about  ? I'm going to keep an eye open and use MtGox/Dwolla in the mean time.

Sounds about right, so far it seems like MtGox/Dwolla is the better option. I just need to send a picture of an ID to Dwolla so they can open my account.
