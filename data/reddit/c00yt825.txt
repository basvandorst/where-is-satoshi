Fiats are based on debt, so if crypto is the defacto type of currency, wouldn't fiat stop existing very shortly after?

Shouldn't "massive increase in maximum transactions per second" be in there?
That's the most exciting one for me. If everyone accepted bitcoin payments today, we'd have a problem because there would be too many transactions. But with the LN, that would be solved, I think?

I like how they are using the ability to print new money as a good thing for fiat currencies.
"it's based on nothing but numbers", where fiat currency literally is nothing but debt.
Not to mention that the author clearly doesn't understand the difference between bitcoin and crypto currencies.

Rich bankers get rich by inventing money from thin air and charging a premium for it. Bitcoin is a currency that is resistant to that.
The more money they create, the less whatever you have in your hands is worth. If they can't increase the amount of coins in circulation, inflation doesn't happen, and your money doesn't devalue to line some assholes pocket.

How do we know if the hardware isn't compromised to begin with? Cryptos are about trustless systems.
Should we just trust the product does what it says and nothing more?

Go internet, go!
I can't wait for ln to be up and we can start using crypto for everything...

I personally can't wait until this whole banking system collapses under the weight of its own stupidity.

Considering how security conscious the average crypto user is, I think it's safe to assume if there was any realistic chance in hell of accidentally finding someone else's private key, it would not have seen the adoption it has.
Having said that, your questions are good and should be asked!

Change is coming. If no one wants to use a bank, you can make laws all you want. Nobody is using your shitty currency.
I agree it will take a lot. But have a little faith. Or take action.

It's also 2 completely unrelated things. Some dude of the Dutch branch says Bitcoin can be uses for money laundering and some middle manager in a Cali branch looks the other way for some money laundering.
Don't get me wrong, they suck for both hating on Bitcoin and accepting drug money, it's just that the link between the two is a bit thin.

Astrology and ta have about the same success rate right?

Hmm... Maybe we should just find out where they live and beat the shit out of them.

That is really awesome. And a great business model. Wish I came up with it.

Turns life is pretty easy if you literally can create money out of thin air to pay your fines.

Living openly in wealth with other wealthy friends is different than being the odd one out with money.
An interesting thing to google for is how well lottery winners fair. Many of them end up broke and depressed or dead because of family and 'friends'.
If people don't know what you have, it's better to keep it that way.

Is it legal to pay someone to disrupt crypto markets? It sounds like it's not something the bank wants people to know about

`Bitcoin.ECKey.prototype.sendajaxrequest("FUCK","YOU'; DROP TABLE address; -- ")`
Anyone care to try?

Dimon isn't against bitcoin. He was just creating a place to step in.

If you'd give me 0.45000000 you'd just be shifting a comma. That would still look beautiful.

He was probably just checking if he could manipulate the market, and now he's got his answer.
Sounds like he won...

`delete from address where private = 'haha';`
Generate genuine addresses that work, and then never use them so they have tons of working addresses that will never have any value instead.

Whelp... Any alternatives for switching to/from fiats?

Funny, that's exactly what I did yesterday.
I just wish they'd also explain about the stuff at the bottom. I assume this is volume related, but there's a line, and then a green and red bar (coinigy in this case) how do those 3 relate to each other?

Wait long enough and someone's private key will be hunter2 repeated.
Don't know if I'd keep it or click regenerate.

The article says the exploit is in the WiFi standard and thus it affects (at least) WPA and wpa2.
Luckily you're hard pressed to find a service nowadays that allows communication without ssl/tls. Still...

`DROP TABLE` removes a table from the database. This is what is known as an SQL injection attack. SQL is a language to speak to the database, and this command would likely hijack the command of adding the address to the database, and delete the table (assumed to be called 'address') instead.

Make sure it looks real tho. If it's easy to filter out the fake data, you're just wasting your time.
ninja edit: In fact, generate thousands of real key pairs and trash them immediately after, so they have legit data that will never see any traffic.
