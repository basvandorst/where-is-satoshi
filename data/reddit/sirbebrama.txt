I dont think it is either but I do not think bitcoin is this  biblical game changer for the economy and banking system. I think there is a good reason that there is a central bank that can increase or decrease the ammount of money to combat de/inflation.

If the central banking system would believe in a keynesian system they would leave their powers of economical impact to the government. Because in the keynesian theorie, if I recall correctly, demand is the domimant economic power and the gpvernment is the side that stimulates demand by welfare and economical actions. 
If the ammount of money and the actions of the cetral bank would be of importance you would have a supply orientated theorie and I guess it was Hayek who proposed this theorie but I am not quite sure.

That is true but the central bank has tools to limit giral money creation. Like minimum reserves and co.

Yes it is hard to trust the banking system after all these years. Because there seems to be no real consequence as a result of failure and consequence. For the banks at least.
I understand the mistrust in central banks very well. Because they only care for the economy, somwtimes forgeting the job of the economy is to create wealth and goods and a good life for everyone.
