Very nice Ryan! Always good to see new businesses taking the BTC route.

Edited to meet your sarcastic request.

I'll take a stab and say 276 people.

Bitcoins will stabilize when demand stabilizes.
Currently there are more and more people diving into bitcoin or selling off their current bitcoin which drives the price up and down. Bitcoin will not be stable until everyone "buys into" it as a legitimate means of exchange and wants it as a transaction agent.
Bitcoin could become just as stable as (or more than) a fiat currency when it has enough people holding it. Stability happens when the increase in total demand for the currency is insignificant compared to the amount of people already demanding it.
Supply doesn't vary enough to cause significant instability.

Anybody think this could work?

I wouldn't want to buy something named after Debt...

Nah, your coins would be stolen each time you were strip-searched at an airport.

I never advocated for keeping a wallet online or on a Windows.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:29:08
That works too, but simply filing a paper wallet away with other papers is dangerous.

If you think BTC value is going up, invest the same amount you would upon market crash into it now. You don't have to buy whole bitcoins if you don't want to.

Yeah, banks buy and sell debt all the time but that doesn't mean it would make a good currency. The idea of buying debt is that there is an incredibly high risk involved because people generally suck at paying off said debt.
The average citizen doesn't trust the word, "debt" even if banks do.

Will you adopt me?

I thought you'd be more creative, but I edited the OP to meet your request.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:10:43
I try to keep my money and my dirty clothes separate.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:25:38
Good lesson. Never store more than you are willing to lose in anything less than a maximum security wallet.
@_date: 2013-06-20 01:59:18
You mean 100 million satoshi's?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:20:11
So the currency that says, "Hey, screw government backed currencies" just got a thumbs-up from the US government?

The infinite best times occurred at all of the points in which bitcoin was cheaper than now.
@_date: 2013-06-20 02:00:21
Yep, that's where the optimistic and unlikely part comes in.
You are using the pessimistic and unlikely approach.

To be honest, holding your assets in the form of a national currency is a terrible idea considering they are constantly inflating and the value of each held unit is decreasing.
Bitcoins are deflating in the long-term which means holding them is not losing money.
