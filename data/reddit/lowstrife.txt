Cold storage, when done properly implementing physical security which we are very good at, can be extremely secure. Multi-sig cold wallets on air-gapped systems stored at multiple physical locations worldwide. That way you can have a "hot" wallet that is adjusted daily to meet the requirements, and even a semi-hot wallet as another intermediary step. That way you can insure each level of storage with different insurance contracts based on the risk of theft to each one. It's not if a hot wallet will be hacked, it's when will it be hacked. 
It's unfortunate enough that all of bitfinex's coins were "hot" because of their bitgo system. There was no cold storage.

 that would work for you.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:00:01
Bitfinex has one key, bitgo has one key, bitfinex has one key in cold storage.
So unless their cold storage was hacked (if it truly was cold, this is the least likely), then both bitfinex and bitgo fucked up and the keys were compromised. 
This is what happens when all of the keys are "hot" to users funds. The benefit of a hot\cold setup is that the hot wallet is "expendable" and only manually replenished.

Interesting perspective. I'm curious and this brings up a different point - why are these banks interested in blockchain at all?

It seems right now everyone is scrambling to see what and how exactly it can be used.

I don't think people buy the low difficulty rigs just because they want to buy bitcoin, they buy them because they want to make money because said difficulty is low. They don't want bitcoin, they want money that happens to be bitcoin. 
Price doesn't follow hashrate. All of 2014 hashrate is making consistent weekly gains, while price is in the longest bear trend of bitcoin's existence. Seems legit.
Indeed it is, but it's a consistent amount of investment that's spread out. Surprises me still how much and readily the supply of bitcoin is absorbed sometimes. 
Also keep in mind there are dark pools of liquidity who buy mined bitcoin off-market from big companies\mining farms. They want "clean" bitcoin that have a verified source of ownership, e.g the colored coin supporters. Same goes for buyers of USM auction coins. I think this makes up a very legitimate amount of the demand for inflationary bitcoin supply. Then what is left is spread among all the exchanges around the world, and yet we still round out 2015 and go up.

That actually is a chart I share among the trading community quite often and they're more familiar with the volume amplification bitstamp ran for a few months. But I'll explain as best I can. 
Here is a old Bitstamp chart from when it started happening. It's easiest to see on the 1m because how it worked is a bot would market buy, then market sell 50 bitcoin. Sometimes it would do 100, but it most commonly did 49.x bitcoin market orders. You can see it here:
Suddent burst of volume, price goes nowhere, the candles get big because the real "spread" is actually shown. In that comment train you can also see other screenshots of very unusual activity caused by this bot.
This volume bot would run at intervals for very short bursts. E.G it would run for 20, 30, 60 minutes a few times a day and throw a few thousand coins around. I believe this is to paint rising volume on the daily\weekly charts leading up to the $500 top. But that is just my theory, so take it with a grain of salt. 
I saw it start roughly around the $192 fakeout bottom in August, give or take a week, and run all the way until in the chart I posted, sometime in the beginning of November. I haven't seen it since. 
Here's another good example:
And while the other charting platforms can't show 1 minute tick data from very old data, here is the best I can show.
Check out 20 OCT 12AM through 4am. Zero market movement, price is basically sideways. Yet check out how the candles get MUCH bigger and all the volume flows through it. I picked a random period, this is not cherry picked. I picked a random day and set this to a 1m chart.
The biggest-tell of this washing was the spread would be engorged to $1-2 (you can see it in the candles) with tons of volume, but the price wouldn't go anywhere. If you watched the ticker, you would see those 50BTC market buy, then market sell, then market buy, then markets sell.
So yes, it is documented, and yes it happened. Not to the extreme that china does it though, but the same concept applies. It doesn't shove price direction in any way or bias it in any way though, which is why in my previous comments about the Chinese volume washing I said it is mostly irrelevant IMO. Bitfinex, BTC-e, and Kracken are the only exchanges with virgin volume anymore. Coinbase had a bot that broke recently and their volume is always a little funky IMO, Bitstamp was virgin up until this bot that I just explained, china is full of washing even before it got REALLY bad in the last few months.

Assuming there isn't massive increase\decrease in the hashrate that is. We're already quite a bit ahead of schedule as it is.
@_date: 2015-12-17 17:02:06
You figured it out :)
By the way, just so you know, the peak of each bubbles' network TX/day doubled in each consecutive bubble.
13k 
As seen here in this picture
Oh and by the way, the peak network TX is 5 for 5 in occurring within 48 hours of peak price. And it is 5 for 5 in doubling each time. 
So if we are estimating 400,000 network transactions\day for the next bubble, resuming back onto the trend of this relationship would result in a market cap of roughly 170 Billion, or maybe 11k per coin peak price. Not saying it will happen... I"m just saying.

Look at detailed volume charts and yes... it's bullshit. In mid-November and before the week of August 20th was legitimate volume I think. 
Bitstamp was doing volume amplification between mid August and mid November as well. Weirdly enough they ended right before okcoin and huobi REALLY stepped up and went nuts. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 18:32:36
Their trading engine I think is fine, the way they have explained it is the disconnect between THAT and the post-processing and database management that has to take place after the fact. You can see direct websockets and see trade executions happen pretty quickly and promptly, but it's the website lag and all that other BS that cause problems. At the end of the day yeah, its awful when things are moving. 
@_date: 2015-12-04 09:34:00
Well there also is a lot less demand for fiat. There are about 22MM usd in longs outstanding compared to about 8000BTC in shorts. These numbers change over time, but longs have ALWAYS outnumbered shorts by 3 as much as 8:1. This is why there is a big of premium on interest for USD is my guess. That and it's easy to inject more BTC to cover demand... not so easy for USD. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 00:28:53
Aren't stratum pools used anyway though? This is just a subtle configuration change of instead of having both pairs of servers (stratum, bitcoin core node) in China, they migrate Core to outside the Firewall to maintain better connectivity since it's with bitcoin core that the bandwidth limitations come in. Am I understanding a typical pooled mining configuration properly? IIRC stratum is still used, though I don't mine so I could be wrong. And a quick google didn't tell me anything concrete other than it got implemented for pools in 2012.

But the volume doesn't matter is what I'm saying. And no, all exchanges don't necessarily follow them. They all interwork together. There are time when china leads, times when futures lead, times when USD exchanges (bitfinex, stamp) lead. There is no clear leader anymore 24\7. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:50:01
I think the main problem is that people understand that bitcoin has always been marketed as "free" transactions. That is not the case anymore because increasing block space scarcity is slowly pricing people out. This was a plausible endgame for some, potentially years if not decades down the road when increasing the blocksize simply wouldn't work anymore or any number of scaling reasons and the network simply won't scale. Then visions like lightning network or any number of other scaling proposals would take the day-to-day stuff while bitcoin itself slowly transitions to a settlement layer. But this process would take years in a maturing ecosystem.
Instead, it's happening WAY sooner. And in a much different way than most expect, pricing out the bottom of the market and slowly moving it's way up. And it's about control. There are now political groups. Us vs Them. Small blockists. Big blockists. Core. "rebel". Censorship... control... now I am seeing talk of "buying" new core devs who agree with "my" side and there should be lobbyists to promote a certain side - not to mention there are the evangelicals who are taking satoshi's writings like they are scripture and spreading his "gospel" to promote their idea of what is right. 
We've introduced all the flaws of humanity that many of us have originally come here for upon our supposedly decentralized and mathmatics based system that was designed to keep as much of that as possible out. What have we done?
@_date: 2015-12-17 01:21:26
I believe because we aren't to that level of mini get to have everything controlled in such a way. Miners are generally bullish on Bitcoin and operate on moving averages instead of a 1:1 representation. If prices go down they will keep mining to generate coins because they expect them to go up again. Plus if your 100 decrease example, we didn't give them enough time to catch up. It took over a month for the hashrate to rise with price, for who knows how many reasons. We didn't stay down long enough for it to drop imo.
Mkners also don't sell all the coins every day. I know buyers specifically buy those coins because they are 100% clean, not tainted.. Miners can hoard coins they otherwise would not buy on the open market... Etc. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:56:04
So... what does he mean? I think OP was implying in a technical sense, which I'm curious to know too what the implications of mining without block validation. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 12:59:54
If the blocksize is not raised, yes. You eventually will just have tx that have a fee that is too low that will NEVER get confirmed. And as more people want to use it, that minimum will continually be raised.

@_date: 2015-06-01 08:35:34


There is no client-level way to determine what fee will make your transaction process to the next block. So what happens in 6 months when all of those transactions are legitimate by people actually trying to move\buy\sell\do things and not just spam? We're capping the size bitcoin can effectively grow to at which point the fees make it no longer a viable option for much of the things it's best at.
And wait, we want to have our transactions take a day to confirm now? The technology exists to the point where we could have Litecoin confirming transactions in 2.5 minutes per minute but we're accepting a day now? That's not really much better than the existing system... 
@_date: 2015-12-04 01:46:23
Yeah, but I think most tumbling services at the end of the day work like coinjoin and darkdsend, don't they? You just mix your coins with everyone elses in transactions, and the end result is that it takes fucking ages. I don't think how it would be possible to have normal confirmation times on transactions that operate like these because you need someone else sending coins at the same time... and a escrow in the middle to act as the 3rd party to make sure things are allocated properly. Or, maybe, it takes a massive innovation like the original bitcoin whitepaper which solved the byzantine general's problem to solve this one in a similarly innovative way. The blockchain solved that problem, and "x" will solve the anonymity problem. 
Yeah fungibility is going to be an interesting one in the coming years. Because yes there are taint analysis services and tools out there that track coins, and nobody truly knows how effective they are. 
I'm not really interested in altcoins to be honest. I trade them during their bubble cycles, but I am not interested in holding them based on properties I like. Bitcoin is already speculative enough, and from my point of view over the last few years, every altcoin is treated as a pump and dump. If someone can develop something "new" and "exciting" from the tech, they will be rewarded as such. Especially if they have good branding. But in the end all of the altcoins have seemed to die off, except litecoin, though even it is victim to pump and dumps. Again, I'm a trader first and foremost, I speculate on the price not their utility. I haven't seen a truly successful altcoin come out yet... they're all just a big niche. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:59:08

@_date: 2015-06-09 02:54:29
So how does the fed pump money into the economy by purchasing treasury bonds? If bonds are basically government IOU's (E.G the Gov is getting loans from individual investors), the FED is basically loaning money to the government right? Aside from public works and general government spending through the public sector, how do these buyback programs give money to the economy? That doesn't quite to be the same thing as giving everyone a 20% tax cut paid for by the FED, does it?
As for interest rates; do many companies and financial institutions directly tie their interest rates which they pass onto their customers to these treasury interest rates? As the FED purchases bonds, the higher price of these bonds drives these interest rates lower because money is "cheap" to get, so borrowing is encouraged? 
I'd also like to know why inflation can be seen as being very low right now. Wouldn't the issuance or injection of a vast sum of money through QE drive up the money supply giving us high amounts of inflation in the economy? We see this in the price of many commodities over the decades and especially since the financial collapse.
And could you perhaps explain how the FED sets interest rates? I thought this was an agreed upon clause between the government and the purchaser of these bonds? Or is this the government and the FED agreeing on different interest rates for *new* bonds that will be purchased? Or does this new interest rate apply to all outstanding bonds? And how can the FED decide this when it more or less is the government's bonds?
But thank you so much, you did a fantastic job of articulating this quite complex network of financial interplay to me. I really had to dig down and dissect your post piece by piece to fully understand it, but you laid it all out in a great way and I hope the greater clarity in this response gives way to how much I was able to take in.
@_date: 2015-06-29 00:55:23


I think this is the most important fact. We do need a blocksize limit raised because Bitcoin simply can't be flirting with the upper limit if we were to get another bubble. Bubbles happen in weeks, and blocksize limits get raised over a period of almost a year by the plans I've seen. I'm not calling that we will get another bubble, but IF WE DO, the network won't be prepared. And it will be ugly.
That being said, I am in full support of sidechains, lightning, and all other solutions. I think Bitcoin eventually (years, decades) will move to being a settlement currency and the "crypto reserve" upon which countless other networks are based on. Just like TCP\IP is the core of the internet backbone with countless other things layered ontop. Does that make the underlying worthless? No. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 00:15:21
If the keys are stored on an internet-connected device it is vulnerable to hacking. No system is safe the moment you go online with it. I almost prefer web-based solutions to bitcoin core because you have chances to add multi-sig solutions like email confirmation and 2FA from a phone which is much more difficult to hack than just a keylogger stealing your password on your computer. 
Virus scan doesn't matter. CC cleaner doesn't matter. You must assume your computer is infected... and this is why bitcoin in it's current form will never go mainstream. You can't have a masters in computer security to deal with basic finance. That just isn't acceptable. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:19:32
Not yet they aren't. After the halving next year and if current rate of TX growth continues, it will account for an additional 3-4% ontop of the block reward. That's nonzero. I don't think you will see many miners mining 1kb blocks then. 
Eventually the problem of miner seeing selfish will sort itself out.

Why are bigger usage in the blocks a bad thing? It shows more people are using the network for more things, eventually enough people will be using it that the non-dust and non-trivial transactions will add up to more than 1MB, or the demand that would be there if the capacity would allow it. Yet you're saying we should centralize anything deemend "not important enough" to other off-chain things that we are trying to escape from in the first place? It makes no sense. 
It's like we have the most powerful supercomputer in the world (well we do, sort-of), but we're limiting the rate of processing to 1% of what it's capible of because we don't want to use too much electricity, or we have a Ferrari but won't let the driver get out of 1st gear.


So tangible solutions to our problems today, which I fully support, are still years out... And we're going to be filling up blocks awfully quickly coming up here in a year if not less. Especially since many miners have a soft-cap of 750k per block (will this remain even after the size limit is raised?).
Lighting and all the other services meant to increase the usability of the network are great... but they aren't here yet to address the problems we have now.
@_date: 2015-06-01 08:32:59
Very true, but we have no fee market, and AFAIK (fact check me here!) it would also require a hard fork to implement. There is no client-level way to determine what fee will make your transaction process to the next block. So what happens in 6 months when all of those transactions are legitimate by people actually trying to move\buy\sell\do things and not just spam?
You would basically be putting a cap on the size bitcoin can grow. "no bigger than this".
@_date: 2015-12-11 03:25:30
Yeah, their systems are too laggy to support any kind of real-time hashrate adjustment in correlation to price. It takes time to roll out infrastructure and hardware. 
I don't get why everyone thinks that... no it is not the case at all. Hashrate is entirely dependent on price. It does not influence price in any measurable way IMO. Price sure as fuck DOES influence hashrate though. 
The only way hashrate effects price is when it is rising significantly, and you are mining more than 3600 bitcoin\day so you have a greater supply of coins needing to be sold every day. This is at most 5-10% and probably not very significant IMO since the daily inflation of bitcoin is very well absorbed and really not significant compared to the regular volatility. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 20:02:25
I'm going to gloss over most of your points; but particularly state that recently a proposal was made to remove the blocksize limit entirely... And replace it with a 2MB soft cap. This allows significantly easier ways of upgrading it in the future and not requiring as much drama to change it.
@_date: 2015-12-04 00:16:20


And this is exactly why it never took off. It was one of the more popular altcoin bubbles, but like all penny stocks like that, it obviously never took hold and has faded to obscurity. They also had the masternodes which took 1000DRK to start, which, at the beginning of the bubble, created a huge demand for DRK which sparked\was part of that massive bubble which happened.

And yes, that instamine wasn't a bug I think. In the scheme of things... "oops" like that doesn't just fuckup to that tune of coins. A very clever pump and dump in the grand scheme of things.


Erm... yeah good point lol. Not heavily used, but yes they do exist. I thought they weren't as effective ask Darksend was capable of, though I'm sure bitcoin tumblers also have somewhat of a similar effect.  


Good point to the root of the problem. I'm not really sure how we solve that. There certainly is a push for colored coins, which is why there is a demand for those USMC "auction" coins because they are precieved to have being the cleanest coins you can possibly acquire. No possibility of being tainted from DNM because they come from the US.Gov (irregardless if they came from a DNM originally).

So are credit cards you can use and pay for stuff online... It's just switching stuff around on their internal systems, not actually using the blockchain network. I understand higher level payment systems for our glorified coffees will have to exist (lightning &amp; such) with Bitcoin simply being the settlement layer underneath, but still. I personally don't like running all the transactions through a company rather than blockchain

Or maybe invest $20,000 into their multi-million dollar mining facility for high-speed dedicated internet &amp; a VPN to run connections outside of the country from. There have got to be ways to get good ping to the rest of the world, routing through Hong Kong being one of them. If improving connectivity in general will help reduce orphan rates and keep up with bigger blocks, then that is one of the optimizations they must make. Besides, bigger blocks = more fees, which especially after the block-reward halving next year will actually start to be significant. 2-3% additional per block.
@_date: 2015-06-01 08:35:34


There is no client-level way to determine what fee will make your transaction process to the next block. So what happens in 6 months when all of those transactions are legitimate by people actually trying to move\buy\sell\do things and not just spam? We're capping the size bitcoin can effectively grow to at which point the fees make it no longer a viable option for much of the things it's best at.
And wait, we want to have our transactions take a day to confirm now? The technology exists to the point where we could have Litecoin confirming transactions in 2.5 minutes per minute but we're accepting a day now? That's not really much better than the existing system...

@_date: 2015-06-10 01:26:55
Strong this. This is why we can see so many full blocks now. Sure we have an average size approaching 400kb; but the peak size often hits the limit because of statistical variance in block size and variations in when people send transactions. Especially when those two mesh together during a point in the day when there are many transactions + a occurrence of slow blocks, you need extra headroom to account for this. This is something many people don't quite realize.

Bitcoin has a near perfect track record for almost it's entire existence. A hickup, caused by over-full blocks causing days-long delays in transactions processing and guessing @ fees, would be horrible news.

Not only that, but there are many unknowns about going into the future without making any changes. Nobody knows what happens with a fee market compared to what we have been operating with for the last 5 years, so moving from minimal\small market to an operating one where block space is now a scarcity is quite a big change.

We're still a few orders of magnitude away from that being a problem. The main problem is internet bandwidth to run a full node; and technically when you run one you aren't personally using it to process your own transactions (though you can). But you're contributing to the diversity. But this centralization will happen either on-chain with fewer high-powered nodes, or it will happen off-chain with services like Coinbase or Changetip or Lightning or other services that are quasi-decentralized but not really. I personally am for EVERYTHING being on a blockchain or some programmable, "autonomous cooperation" if you will. 


Really? Why is it not capable of 1MB blocks? Also, the only reason why the node count was as high as it was is because you had to run a full node to store your bitcoin or do whatever it is you wanted until pretty much 2014. Now with the advent of lightweight (SPV) wallets that don't run in a full service, nobody actually wants to go through running a full node *because they don't have to.* This is not a problem of 1MB blocks, it is a problem of humans being humans and being lazy &amp; tragedy of the commons. 


Non-linear growth. Also, you need to account for spikes in transactions, not a 7-day average. If we were to experience another period of growth like those in 2013, where the transactions\day shoot up 200-300% over the course of a few weeks, we'd have a pretty nasty problem on our hands. Especially without a fee market, there is no way the network could handle it, confirmation times and fees would be... I honestly don't know what would happen. But it wouldn't be pretty.


Interesting. So I guess we will see. Even if the advent of 20MB blocks miners will still relay smaller ones so your effective average will be much smaller. But eventually higher and more plentiful transaction fees relative to the block reward (especially after the halving next year), this will start to be reduced.
@_date: 2015-06-01 08:37:23
I'm not just talking about now, I'm talking about 1, 3, 5 years down the line if the network keeps growing though. We'd be capping the size of the network to a certain point by this fee structure, limiting any growth beyond that because "oh man we can't have bigger blocks, so your transaction must not be important enough to pay this fee". How does this scale up an order of magnitude? Are 1BTC fees accecptable if Bitcoin grows through another bubble phase?
And besides, we don't have a functioning fee market. Nobody has coded one, not that I've seen.

This pump we're seeing really isn't Greeks buying Bitcoin, the penetration there is very small still. It's just speculation among the existing community of crossing that damn bear trendline IMO.

Interesting, I have had a tough time understanding the interplay between all of these different markets in finance in general so bear with me. So their "pumping of money" into the economy as it were is by purchasing bonds (offers of the government for people to give them money basically); which created a bond bubble that ties to the interest rates? The yield of bonds = expected return inflation adjusted? So if we get sudden spikes of inflation suddenly these bonds will no longer be giving good returns? 
Does this have any inkling to the money leaving the country as well? Still a very... complex interplay for all of this. I truly still don't understand it.
@_date: 2015-06-01 08:21:56
Well miners already have a 0.75MB limit on the blocks as is. And during last weekends stress test of the network by Reddit, we saw transactions take as much as 8 hours to confirm by simply overwhelming the network. If we lower the blocksize to 250kb or even 500kb; every block would become full and confirmation times would skyrocket. Isn't this seen as being extremely bad, as the network would, on the surface, cease to function as a realtime transfer of value when transactions take dozens of hours if not days?

Very good points not many realize.

Not to mention the fact that we have seen a major drawdown on the # of users in Bitcoin since those bubbles, that will naturally lower the count as well.
Blame SPV and web wallets for the reason why nodes are becoming "more centralized", not bigger blocks.

Especially considering their business model relies on accepting zero-confirmation transactions for orders to be promptly filled.

Who the hell mines bitcoin to acquire them these days? in 2010 sure, but today you only mine for A) hobby or B) as a professional venture to make money with hundreds of thousands to millions of startup capital. I'm sure some people do buy miners from ebay to acquire their coins, but do you know how tiny of a percentage this is relative to the network hashrate?
There are only 3600 coins made per day, mining (inflation) does not have a significant effect on price. 3600 coins being sold across public exchanges, dark pools, private stashes is not that many to be bought up... 
If people want to buy bitcoin they go to the exchange and buy it, or local bitcoins, or coinbase, etc, etc.

Coming from a privacy standpoint yes I think many people won't like the transparent nature of the blockchain and the fact that their payments can be tracked, but it's an entirely new way of looking at money so there are many revolutionary things that need to be sorted out over hell, the next decade. This is one of them. Whether it makes the list of "shit to do" like the blocksize... erm, problem, has is yet to be seen.

there are those who want to maintain the "original vision of satoshi" and using his posts as religious scripture and treating him like a prophet. Welcome to the imperfect attributes of humanity imparted onto a system of numbers and math. 
All of this is the reality of what we face today, instead of forming cost-benefit analysis, voting groups, discussion pannels and educated discussions on the implications of all these upgrades\changes to the system we all want to see succeed. I see very little actual joint-team research being done, and a ton of shit talking in single-blog posts.
@_date: 2015-06-20 01:39:01
We know what will happen. But people don't realize the implications of what will actually happen and what services will **break** because of this transaction backlog. It will be ugly. And somehow people haven't gotten it through their head how overloading the network with this kind of transaction backlog will negatively effect the rate of transactions flowing.
When your standard fee transaction doesn't get confirmed for 1-2 days in transaction load that soon will become normal at the rate it's growing, suddenly that Coinbase purchase starts getting a lot riskier for them. Or you can't move funds around and most people don't understand re-broadcasting a transaction, or fees in general.
@_date: 2015-06-11 18:13:07
A working fee market? Has anyone done work to get this done? To publish a system that gives realtime update on fee required to have 50% chance of being included in next "x" blocks. This is all theory but nobody has done it.
It's a bigger chance to the normal everyday operation of the network by not doing anything. We know what will happen, reasonably, when we increase the blocksize. Do we know what will happen when blocks start becoming full? Like, REALLY know what will happen? We have theories about mempool... and fee markets... but has anyone researched for this about what actually will occur when these things start getting tested.

So... everythign you are saying I 100% agree with and I think is correct except your conclusion. Mining hashrate will be equal to the revenue derived, +\- waste, inefficiencies, etc, but eventually yes mc=mr in a perfect world (humans aren't perfect so there we go). 
The thing is, price is not supported by it. You need legitimate capital to buy coins and support a bid depth in the market. You can't have a backward assumption of this. Mining is supply only, it is inflationary, it does not contribute to price or the bid depth necessary to support price action. And futures are paper markets, while they move spot from a trading perspective, they are 1:1 and must equalize in the end. So yes miners can hedge their sales with them which is great, and I'm sure some use that to equalize their mining operations. 
Eventually, the hashrate will track price*tx fee volume in a 1:1 relationship automatically adjusted at the best resolution algorithms can come up with. Mining hashrate will vary not by new hardware being added but by controlling the clock speed of the chips to keep them in perfect equilibrium. 
But again... Hashrate does not, in my opinion, support price. It is entirely dependent on what the price does. Remember my chart I psoted, hashrate and price spent a year going in the same direction (up up), then a year going in opposite directions (up down). 
@_date: 2015-06-09 21:59:34
If you listened to the most recent LTB episode Mike was on; he said that eventually they are just going to go forward with the changes and launch Bitcoin XT very soon (1-2 weeks) and just go forward with the changes. If that is what the general public wants everyone else will just get left in the dust. He said that there needs to be a strict concensus of a lead dev like the role Gavin and Satoshi once played, with Vladimir taking a "hands off" approach that isn't authoritarian and helping to remove deadlocks like this.
I believe inaction is worse than any kind of action at this point. A simple debate of right and wrong here, while certainly filled in with grey, should not be a squabble of politics.  
@_date: 2015-12-17 17:05:08
You are correct, it is the number of users squared. But there is no real metric of that other than the number of transactions those users make by using the network. Sort of have to work with what you've got.

This. Both new and old reserve hardware. Older miners not used anymore probably became profitable recently. And pools increasing their hashrate by overclocking their chips to max out their potential. I know of some who de-clocked their hardware to save power when the price was in the 200's. 
Hashrate is pretty laggy to price, it takes time to adjust and ramp up hardware.

We can't sacrifice the usability of the entire underlying Bitcoin network for the user experience of a layer ontop of it. 
You only talk about spv and electrum, but ignore nearly every other talking point for the reasons why we need bigger blocks. Even other proposals for increasing network scaling like the lightning white paper need bigger blocks like Mike said in the podcast. 
If Bitcoin has a bad day, so does everything included with it. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 08:06:46
If today suddenly blocks were limited to 50kb, where would all the people go who use the network for all the reasons they currently do? You would be throttling a limit on the number of people who would be able to use the network (when it fully can support each and every one), to make it slightly easier for someone to run a node on a dial-up connection? Doesn't seem like a good tradeoff to me. 
You shouldn't have a ferrari capable of handling a million miles an hour while telling the driver he can't leave first gear. The network can handle the load, and we can't stay stuck in the stone age worried about trivial problems forever. If we go down to politics and semantics over a couple bucks a month for running nodes... The irony will burn for years.
IMO if the block tx limit doesn't get resolved (it's actually worse than we thought with a soft-soft limit at 0.75MB by many mining pools), we will see some very nasty effects... When people realize their transactions take hours if not days to get one confirmation from increasing usage, Bitcoin suddently goes from sending money in 10 minutes to sending money in no minutes... And once the transactions start piling up the low power nodes who have limited memory start dropping off the network due to swap hell or being killed by their operating system for using too much RAM.
The network won't regulate itself with 100% efficiency, people will not decide to halt a transaction if it exceeds the limit of 3 transactions per second globally... No, people will send 3, 4, 5 transactions per second regardless of if the network can handle it or not. Thinking that "fees will regulate everything" won't work because people want to use the resource.
And that's just the beginning, since we have no reasonable way at a client\user level to regulate or even tell what fee will determine your transaction a x% probability to get confirmed in the next 6 blocks. So nobody will know what the fee will make their transaction work. It's not like we have a market or orderbook for fees, so it will be pretty much "hit &amp; miss". 
Now we have no real technology to compensate for this other than just raising the blocksize limit. You need liquidity and market cap to transfer value, and Litecoin\dogecoin are the only two I know of that would be capable of handling even a fraction of what Bitcoin does. Sidechains\lightning are still months if not years away from a functioning implementation not to mention all the associated layering work that needs to go on in conjunction with them.
@_date: 2015-06-11 21:40:29
Yeah... and? What determines the cutoff? Will the default fee be enough? And I'm not just counting during that stress test, I mean during periods of growth 6-12 months from now if we keep growing. How will you know what fee is enough? There is NOTHING in place, the default fee is completely arbitrary. Suddently 2milibit won't be enough, then 3, then 5, then 10; if there is enough demand.
not to mention spikes in transactions at times when there are low  of blocks due to statistical variance, the wait times will be HUGE. I'm talking hours even with a "appropriate" fee because there simply will be so many queued up.
@_date: 2015-06-11 12:55:40
And because it was during a bubble where everyone was involved and doing something, so of course everrtytigng involving Bitcoin was inflated. Node count, exchange volume, market price, media attention, transactions, all of them were high because there were so many people involved. Now, it's amazing the transactions are up, but of course there will be decline in nodes because many people were know running them because they had no other option or the tutorial told them they needed to. Now everyone uses cold storage or coinbase, with few needing to run a full node for any point in verification or using coins. 
Because of this I think the node count is still pretty damn high all things considered.

The soft fork defaults are 100, and the natural demand is 200,yku are forcing prices up through an artifical means so yes. But only if demand is greater than supply. 
Any cap that is lower than supply actually acts as an artifical price control and changes the natural equilibrium of a fee market that would otherwise develop.

Yes this is very true. I think the hope was is that by that time the network will have grown to "x" size that even minimal transaction fees would be self-sustaining.

20MB blocks would be 20x harder to fill... We had to have a purpose-driven community effort to DDOS the blockchain for what seems to be just about the first time- ever. Why hasn't it happened from "nefarious people" yet?
Now lets say you could make a perfect fee market. Tomorrow. Coded perfectly. Bug tested. Has anyone done this? We don't really have a lot of time until blocks become full. Not to mention that you're still cutting off all the potential transactions below that fee threshold, so you're cutting off an entire section of the economy that would like to use the network... but can't because fees make up an absurdly large % of the transaction... isn't that part of what Bitcoin was created for? Sounds pretty similar to what happens with western union and current credit cards.
And besides, a fee market requires a hard-fork to implement last time I checked (could be wrong! Someone should fact-check this), but I think one would have to be coded from the ground up first.

My point was how stressful and chaotic it would have been if we had been undergoing a network hard fork in the middle of a bubble. People asking why their clients wouldn't work after the switchover, etc, etc. While things are calm like they have been for the last few months is the best time.
@_date: 2015-06-12 02:06:32
True, but the argument of both sides is that other technologies need to take advantage of bitcoin being a settlement layer and using things like the lightning network to promote higher usability. We can't really have a problem with the network and payments no longer becoming "instant", that will jar the image of bitcoin if over time the amount of time (due to overload) the transactions take to confirm grows and grows. Even a decent settlement layer shouldn't have 8hr confirmation times for the lower 25% of the network fee structure, or whatever the actual numbers end up being.
Approaching the capacity changes the network in a far more drastic way, and that is exactly what the people who want no change at all want to avoid - drastic change or changes in the incentive structure. Sure bigger blocks = more fees as well which will help combat the higher orphan rates - but again in the devils advocate argument you also gave, the downside is that we can "continue kicking the can down the road" in the future by just increasing the blocksize limit every time we get close to a problem. We did it once, why not do it again?
Cost-benefit analysis. To me, the costs of doing nothing outweigh the costs of increasing the size. Sure neither are perfect, and bigger blocks bring a host of other problems, but I personally feel they are lessor than the ones that will arise otherwise.

If today suddenly blocks were limited to 50kb, where would all the people go who use the network for all the reasons they currently do? You would be throttling a limit on the number of people who would be able to use the network (when it fully can support each and every one), to make it slightly easier for someone to run a node on a dial-up connection? Doesn't seem like a good tradeoff to me. 
You shouldn't have a ferrari capable of handling a million miles an hour while telling the driver he can't leave first gear. The network can handle the load, and we can't stay stuck in the stone age worried about trivial problems forever. If we go down to politics and semantics over a couple bucks a month for running nodes... The irony will burn for years.
IMO if the block tx limit doesn't get resolved (it's actually worse than we thought with a soft-soft limit at 0.75MB by many mining pools), we will see some very nasty effects... When people realize their transactions take hours if not days to get one confirmation from increasing usage, Bitcoin suddently goes from sending money in 10 minutes to sending money in no minutes... And once the transactions start piling up the low power nodes who have limited memory start dropping off the network due to swap hell or being killed by their operating system for using too much RAM.
The network won't regulate itself with 100% efficiency, people will not decide to halt a transaction if it exceeds the limit of 3 transactions per second globally... No, people will send 3, 4, 5 transactions per second regardless of if the network can handle it or not. Thinking that "fees will regulate everything" won't work because people want to use the resource.
And that's just the beginning, since we have no reasonable way at a client\user level to regulate or even tell what fee will determine your transaction a x% probability to get confirmed in the next 6 blocks. So nobody will know what the fee will make their transaction work. It's not like we have a market or orderbook for fees, so it will be pretty much "hit &amp; miss". 
Now we have no real technology to compensate for this other than just raising the blocksize limit. You need liquidity and market cap to transfer value, and Litecoin\dogecoin are the only two I know of that would be capable of handling even a fraction of what Bitcoin does. Sidechains\lightning are still months if not years away from a functioning implementation not to mention all the associated layering work that needs to go on in conjunction with them.

I see, I understand the transfer of wealth between the two now. Because the government supply of bonds is a place people normally would put their money, the Fed buys up that market to make it artificially more expensive to encourage people to put their money into other sectors of the economy. Securities, equities, etc as you said; or loans in the form of banking institutions. Would I be to far to stretch that because of this push of freed up money would create lower interest rates for loans provided because of this? Greater supply of people loaning money to suit the same demand of people wanting loans would make for good rates I would assume? This I assume would be the other side of the coin as some other interest rates would be as you said set to treasury yields (AKA bond yields aka bond dividends?). 
I see your use of the "" in risk free, it's technically never happened before but it indeed is entirely possible to happen; but the majority of people involved are highly motivated to prevent it from happening and doing anything they can; so the likelihood from a risk management perspective can be seen as near-zero. I'm sure many do assume it as zero because if it were to happen, everything would be fucked anyway as it were. So right now if treasury yields are rather low right now because of the high price due to QE, many people sold treasuries which would imply there is more money (at least speaking just within bond markets) being put into cooperate bonds, not to mention the other asset classes you mentioned earlier. Though once you start mixing international commerce it gets even murkier I suspect, with capital flight and other over-seas things getting thrown in there as well. 
Well the problem with QE and especially because it had to have 3 rounds of it, is that who will be there to buy all those securities again? Are they just going to be holding all of those "for a rainy day" for when they need to push the other way on inflation and pull money out of the economy? Or will they hold them until maturation, because especially as private institution, I'd assume they are getting the interest payments from the government? Which is weird because didn't they buy them in the first place with a few trillion dollars they made out of nothing?
Oh ok I see, I understood the price of the underlying bond could fluctuate which would change the interest rate calculation  but didn't make the connection that it would also affect the yield like that... Gotcha. 
Yeah you are pretty good at explaining things, I sometimes have a tough time separating the facts into distinct categories to give clear explanations. I love explaining things I know (E.G Bitcoin stuff); and randomly times come like you have now when someone who is interested comes out of the woodwork. You mentioned finance students, would that mean you're in the education system :D? Simple power of deduction. I have a partial degree in economics, but I did not get to the money and banking section yet; mostly it has been about labor curves, basic economic structure, and game theory... So not really anything finance related because that's not what the degree is for. But again thanks for taking the time to (at length) explain these things, it has helped clarify at least the bond market which I've always struggled with to understand it's relationship with everything else.

Charts are evidence, how else am I supposed to show proof? Changing the open\close of candles in such a way (AKA making the spread bigger) is not something that is free
ormal especially on bitstamp where there are trading fees. And this was done countless times. You simply can't make the spread on an exchange bigger if you are paying trading fees, which is exactly what the charts I posted show. Do you understand this concept?
Seeing orders of 50 bitcoin on bistamp, seeing it HUNDREDS of times is not normal. I would litterally sit there and watch market buy 50, market sell 50, market buy 50, market sell 50. For half an hour! And this went on for months. Me and plenty of other people in the threads I linked to. I wish I had screenshots of the ticker to show the gruoping of 50BTC orders again, and again, and again, but I don't. 
And those are to supplement my first-hand experience of the market that I watch. I am a full-time trader, I spent a year on okcoin futures and I have watched this market almost every single day since mid 2013, I know what is normal and what is not. 
And it is not a theory, plenty of other traders who actually trade on these markets share my opinions. Between the okcoin and huobi volumizer™, but in the less-known stamp volumizer. As to why Bitstamp did this, remains to be seen. I have my theories, but the facts are there.

Wait, what. I'm curious to know why you think that? IDGAF what advertising they have but 2.5 minute blocktimes will give your first set of 6 block confirmations 4x faster than Bitcoin does. Wanting to REQUIRE more confirmations because of the inherit lessening of security of the faster confirmations and such that it brings changes that slightly but not at a 1:1 ratio. Maybe you want 8 confirmations or 10 instead. But not 24.

All the markets down 5% within minutes, this is going to get ugly. If the results of the last news source are any indicator, I think this one will be a little nicer but were going to see some prices that veterans won't like very much.
I'm as short as I could be right now, I'll be staying up all night to catch the bottom.
EDIT1 @ 10:19GMT: Gox broke 600, Stamp and BTCe are following in unison at 670 right now. I wonder if Stamp will overreact again and drop a good 10% lower than BTCe after the last news announcement. 
EDIT2 @ 10:22GMT: The Trollbox is blowing up right now, "double spending death of Crypto". I don't believe it to be that serious at all, but I can't imagine the headlines tomorrow are going to be any good. We may have a chance for some cheap(er) coins...
EDIT3: @ 12:30GMT: Gox continues to plunge past 575. In hindsight this person predicted the problem Mtgox just posted perfectly [here]( and I'm amazed that he managed to pick up and explain it brilliantly. It's almost like he had insider information... (tinfoilhat). A pretty interesting read.
EDIT4 @ 12:38GMT: Markets are turning around quicker than I expected. At least for now the doomsday isn't happening, which is good. Though as I type this Gox dropped more to 555 and the rest are hovering around 660.
EDIT5 @ 12:48GMT: Well Bitstamp and BTCe just blew up, 640's and counting and there is no sign of stopping. Litecoin also became unhinged from Bitcoin at this point too which I thought was interesting, the LTC\BTC ratio is dropping like a rock. I'm goign to buy BTC and buy into that once this thing turns around.
EDIT6: @ 12:56: HOLLY CRAP BTCe, they just had a glitch or something but 3000BTC just ate up every single bid wall on the site and tanked the price to 100 per BTC. That person cashed out their entire stash in one go. That was absolutely insane. If anyone had any bid orders at $100 you just got lucky....
EDIT7: Obviously I stopped updating because things got very late into the night and trading got frantic. Quite the events though, I hope some of you made some profits from the volatility. I know I did! ~14%. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 08:09:16
 Technically it's been touched 3 times, the very first was the MASSIVE volatility during the US Senate hearings on 11\19. Then China, then Gox. When I saw we had a solid floor at basically $400 I was shocked.
@_date: 2015-06-01 08:37:23
I'm not just talking about now, I'm talking about 1, 3, 5 years down the line if the network keeps growing though. We'd be capping the size of the network to a certain point by this fee structure, limiting any growth beyond that because "oh man we can't have bigger blocks, so your transaction must not be important enough to pay this fee". How does this scale up an order of magnitude? Are 1BTC fees accecptable if Bitcoin grows through another bubble phase?
And besides, we don't have a functioning fee market. Nobody has coded one, not that I've seen. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:10:21
So we have the power of 10-minute confirmations for all but you think making users wait a day or two for confirmations are healthy? The fuck? What about (if) there are exponentially more transactions that want to use the network for legitimate reasons than are allowed? The waiting period will keep getting pushed back and back as the transactions pile up. Every bit past the limit we go just adds to the unconfirmed list of transactions waiting to be confirmed and mined into a block, eventually you're only allowing the top "x" percent to get mined. Sounds pretty terrible to me.
Also, if enough people start using the network, the lowest transactions will *never* get confirmed because their fee is simply too low and nobody will mine their transaction because of the flood of all the other ones that are paying fees that do want to get in.
So, instead of a open and easy to use system we are already limiting who can use it based on **how much you can pay**...
I'm sort of speechless anyone can have this point of view.... We're imposing limits on what we've created.

This is a very good point. If they had purchased it at anywhere near market prices, like I explain the $100 million would give a price of $880, then they still have a considerable position left over to be purchasing. 
I wouldn't be surprised if they diversified their buy-ins across multiple means of purchasing, but I think we can both be in agreement that the DBB event 10 days ago was probably the bulk of their purchasing. Other than a whale renewing cold-storage wallets (why?), any event where that many BTC would be purchased would be noticed. I believe we're just now starting to see that.

It's a cycle. The recovery period is simply that, a recovery\correction from the months of pressure depressing the price so a correction is natural. This causes a rise in price and increase in interest, then a calm period for a "launch pad" to develop for another bubble to happen. If there is a big jump in price in a new bubble, you can be damn sure there will be news to follow it drawing attention to the space.
The biggest metric to judge is the number of users joining the space, and while Mt.Gox was a severe hamper on the growth of the people, we've mostly recovered from that and are still full steam ahead. Bitcoin for all intents and purposes is all-or-nothing.

Guys, I just followed the transactions of one of the coins. I don't think it's Satoshi. It's Mtgox. Follow the largest transactions in both of these addresses back (these are two out of the 4 inputs for the 180k move). Eventually you will get to the 424242.424242 Mtgox proof of ownership transaction Marky Mark did in 2011.
What if the theories of Mtgox loosing control of it's stash of Bitcoins by loss of the private keys are right? This means Mark FINALLY just managed to recover a chunk of them that haven't been moved since 2011 when he moved them to prove ownership. If they had gotten stolen, we wouldn't be seeing this many bitcoin days destroyed. 
EDIT: I'm not the first one to come up with this, damn. I followed the same line of thoughts from other people though.

What chose you to set that stop loss? I would have waited to see if the $400 range would be broken or not. $400   - $380 has proven to be a HUGE historical resistance level and has been majorly tested 3 times now. I would have waited to see if we breach it before selling the remainder, otherwise I would hold on. I mean your stop-loss was so close to it anyway (I imagine it was around $500)? I've been watching the charts like a hawk watching the markets dip lower and lower to $400, and while we're not out of the woods yet it has yet to break through that level.
If we had broken through $400, I would commend that sell because we would be in for some serious shit if that happened and your fears and precautions would be fully realized and justified.

All 3 are parallel lines on the same slope. The bottom line is the expected lower level of support of the growth depending that all other factors are increasing (# users, transactions, etc). As long as everything is still growing and developing, that lower support line should continue the exponential growth. 
The next line is connecting the peaks of the "normal" bubbles, while the final line is drawling a parallel line to the megabubble we had in 2011 and probably will never repeat again. Think of that as the ultimate "upper" limit of growth, while the middle line is the normal upper limit of growth.

There would be sidechains that allow for day to day transactions that don't need the massive computing power to protect them. You use the size of the Bitcoin network for serious transactions which also incur a higher fee because of the repository of mining equipment that is running and protecting it. 
You would have smaller side chains that run mictopaymentd which are specialized for speed and don't necessarily have as much hashing security because the value per transaction is far lower.

So if you transfer your Bitcoins over to the sidechain in this fixed ratio, what process allows you to transfer the units of wealth on that chain? Is there merged mining so they piggypack onto Bitcoin mining and pay the fees in the sidechain denomination, which is converted to BTC to form of fees for the miners? 
Also, would they have a separate blockchain? I presume so. The main use I see for sidechains is running a separate network that's still backed by Bitcoin, but has other possible improvements and possibly could handle far more transaction volume. But why not do that with Bitcoin itself and decrease the complexity?

It is fundamentally impossible for transaction malleability to have stolen that many coins. On the timeframe they were talking about, there simply weren't that many BTC transacted on the entire NETWORK. And how could they have "found" 200,000BTC after they were stolen?
My point is that there either was A) a massive hacking and theft of coins on the exchange and they tried to cover it up or B) they were slowly funneled away from someone without alerting the staff that the cold wallets were quickly emptying. The only way B could happen is if someone on the inside was hush-hush about the status of the cold wallets.

[]Install clean image of Windows (I know I know) onto brand new out of the box laptop
[]Install nothing except Opera because Shitternet explorer wouldn't run the site at all
[]The drivers for ethernet or wireless aren't even installed
[]Install drivers for brand new printer from driver CD

This is the entire price action of Bitcoin since it started trading on Mt.Gox in 2011 at more or less 5 cents each. Bitstamp only goes to 2012 and completely misses Megabubble zero to $32, and Mt.Gox price data... is a bit incomplete as of late. This is a blend of the two.

Which is all very true, it's just a different perspective on looking at things. This is an entirely new financial class of things we are looking at and it basically rewrites the book on assets and everything like that. The inflation of the currency is added into the people who are processing the transactions, and while it is not TECHNICALLY a part of that process it is considered part of the incentive reward structure and a reward of the game theory that supports the network.
I'm not arguing against the existence of the block rewards, it helps bootstrap the distribution of the currency along with strengthen network security while the price is still low and transaction fees are negligible. 
It is not a direct cost per transaction, but it could be considered an implied cost per transaction because you have the hardware that is used to secure the network being paid for by the block reward. It is a brilliant system and I have no way of saying that it is bad in any way, but it is just a completely different way of looking at monetary inflation as typically that is not included into the (real) price of a transaction.

Would you be opposed to calling the centralization of mining power into even a few coorperations (yes companies) a bad thing then right? Because it's my understanding they would all be operating in the confidence of MAD, mutually assured destruction. If any one of them deviates, they destroy their entire business model and they are worth nothing. The security of the network operates in a shocking way to the security of the planet between global superpowers.
Never mind about transaction fees, even if they end up being 1\2 of what is currently in place it's still better, competition should still keep it lower.
Your post was a fascinating insight to the game theory and incentives logic behind the structure of the Bitcoin network, many thanks.

Interesting concept. Though to be honest, having multiple copies of your paper wallets should be standard anyway. I personally have 3 copies stored in different locations.

There is no way to know what the "actual" CNY volume is. People who would otherwise use USD markets to enter and exit the marketplace will trade on okcoin or Huobi because the fees are lower. I'm one of these people and I know plenty more. Additionaly there are bots that trade to take advantage of the zero fees to increase liquidity and scalp off of large marketmovements (or algo trade). All these things add up and make for a huge marketplace compared to Bitstamp. It's even possible to buy your own orders again and again to pump up volume.

Physical locations such as ATM's will always have higher costs, and it's possible to purchase coins online without high fees. Many of the costs are implemented from getting money from the old banking system into the exchanges. Wire transfers aren't free, 3rd party money transmitters won't interact with Bitcoin that often, Paypal hasn't started playing yet, etc. This raises the difficulty and the risk, along with the price.
It's still possible through sites like coinbase to purchase Bitcoins at cheap prices though. And in the scheme of things, right now, 2-3% fee is irrelevant when the overall volatility is still as high as it is. The price has varied by 10% in the last 24 hours alone.

LTC was rising slightly, which is odd because normally it crashes harder than BTC.

You can easily loose the encryption key or what if that USB stick becomes corrupted? Then you use two USB sticks. But they could have the same problem. Then you use three sticks, all by different manufacturers. And store them all in different places. And have seperate backups of the password for the encryption...
Paper wallets are just simply easier. Scan the private key into your blockchain.info account and immediately send the funds to another wallet after importing them, then you can spend them accordingly and put the remainder back into cold storage paper wallets.

Touche. I personally said it once at $400 when Mtgox crashed and I thought it was over. I was happy when the pump to $700 happened as alot of people thought we were on track for a solid trend break then; but when we failed to break the downward slope we've been in since December I became less and less optimistic. 
Recently, I had two choices. If 400 holds we're golden, but if it breaks we're going to have some fun. Since the thing that has been causing us to slide for the last month is China, that being finally "over" gives me a reasonable confidence to say for now we're getting some solid ground. Plus over the last week or so any dips have been having increasingly stronger bull rallies after them.

6 months ago I conducted a poll that, if there was another bubble, what price would be the peak. I got 200 replies from here and The average guess? $4800, with this sub being slightly higher on average.

That's why your coins were stolen. You basically put the keys to the funds that were originally encrypted with 256-bit encryption with a password that is 64 characters long and instead protected it with whatever your password was on your dropbox account which can be accessed by anyone on the internet. 
This is, IMO, a major issue for Bitcoiners out there. Wallet security is a tough thing.

It's a compression of the price. The market has reached it's equilibrium point and over the next week or so we will see a direction picked. Whichever it is it is impossible to say now, but it will be a powerful move in that direction without a doubt...

Excellent that is good news then. How many different "markets" will you have? Will you have one market for USD, one for CNY, one for JPY, one for Eur, etc? That would provide poor liquidity across all of them, or will there be unified order books or one central currency they are all traded on?
I've been waiting for margin trading to become more common though, bitfinex is the only exchange I currently trust to do it. I'm glad you guys are working on the international front though, it will be a tough race against regulated American exchanges like Atlas ATS. Do you think you will keep your 0% fee model as standard across all the markets in the future?

I don't consider the anonymity of Satoshi a flaw. If he were a known person, then any problems with the protocol or any major incentives would all be thrown at him. There would be a "face" to the concept of Bitcoin and would be the most centralized thing anybody could attack it with. Because he is completely (and very well) hidden, Bitcoin exists as this extensional entity instead of a construct to be manipulated by one person. 
There would be "satoshi nakamoto, creator of Bitcoin" interviews and all sorts of press which would make it seem like every other attempt at a "new product". Instead it is represented as this "thing" that just exists, and not so much time is concentrated on who made it.

BTCChina employs maker-taker markets, where putting up an order has a 0% trading fee but taking one down incurs the 0.2% cost. This allows people to put up liquidity walls keeping the margins razor thin (0.1 CNY margins, just look at their historical charts).
Bitcoin ATM's do have massive fees, but that is not called slippage. That's just straightforward fees off of people who want to capitalize on the speculation and want the convenience. They're just starting to come out, of course the fees will be insane. 
And these scams are nothing in comparison to the credit card theft that happens in the USA. What do you expect a technology that's still in Beta testing that has really only been even somewhat "mainstream" for a few years.

You can't chart something that hasn't even finished forming yet, so planning the first bubble would be completely archaic. And yes, drawing lines at the beginning of 2013 would be difficult because it was just forming the resistance. But you could have drawn the lines, that and the very beginning are the only points of reference. 
And we will be adding one more point in the coming weeks, there is a very strong chance we will re-test $340 one last time before completing what is called a 3-drive pattern and rising out of the wedge. $300 is fucking beautifully on the trend line and would establish a very consistent growth pattern.

It had risen so fast it wasn't able to support itself, and add to that Gox at the time had &gt;70% market share. The site was lagging bad, from DDOS and sheer volume. You would have to wait 5-8 hours for your trade to finally be executed because there was so much going on, so you had no clue what you were buying\selling at. It was a blind crapshoot.
It crashed down, they halted trading to let things cool off.

The sad thing is that it's more profitable to use customer funds to develop ASIC's and then use those to mine while delaying delivery as long as possible.

I totally understand the two concepts. But understand- the network is only as "secure" as it is today with as much hashrate as it is today because of the block reward. Transaction fees make up a tiny fraction, maybe 1% if not less I'm not 100% sure. If there were no block reward, the transaction fees would currently only support a far less "secure" network as the mining incentive would be much lower. 
I suppose what I should have said is that the network security against network takeover is being subsidized by block rewards. Each processed transaction is being "rewarded" by a large sum of money due to these block rewards, but it is not a direct correlation to how many transactions there are.
It is the sum of this:

Mtgox is now less than 30% of the price of the rest of the exchanges. How long will this continue? Will Gox crash to basically zero? I can't even imagine....
The dip-buying is strong on Bitstamp and BTCe though. It looks like most of the sales are speculators who are trying to beat out the other person. Nobody is selling into a true panic, they're just trying to make a quick buck and time the bottom. Gox has become almost completely decoupled from the rest of the Bitcoin exchanges. They're actually going UP as Gox is breaking into the $140's. Nobody believes them anymore.
@_date: 2014-02-03 17:54:28
After reading that article, I have to conclude he did not there out a single good argument at all and downright lied in some parts. I'll write up more when I'm not on my phone... 
EDIT: Aaaaannnnd I'm back. First off, they start by making the analogy that these coins are sold by some "company", which is irrational and ignorant to start off your article by. Secondly, every link that is linked to within the article (like the Bitcoin imperfections link) is actually a pro-bitcoin article which makes me think the author didn't actually read them. He also continues to say that purchasing a different alt-coin will drive down the price of Bitcoin, as if there is a finite supply of money in the ecosystem. At the endgame this does hold somewhat true (but is often lost in the "noise"), but we're still undergoing exponential growth right now. Furthermore, he refers to cryptocrrencies as "payment media", which isn't a bad analogy in theory, but in his context it couldn't be any more wrong. He refers to it as a $300 "payment media", instead of investing $300 into a medium of exchange and states that the dominant market price for a currency is $50. Does he even understand supply\demand and different market caps for different cryptocurrencies?
Futher on, he says that the outstanding value (market cap) is about $20 billion. A quick google search would reveal it's about half that, Gjeoff. This was a poorly written article and certainly not what the OP was asking for nor what I was looking for.
@_date: 2014-04-22 09:45:38
The lack of institutional trust because of poor quality and unregulated exchanges is what creates volatility. People are afraid to trade the coins on the exchanges, and it will create problems with increasing the liquidity pool as the market cap grows.

I feel at some point the value of the dollar and it's fluctuations will have an impact on the BTC price. Bitcoin will be seen as a "hedge" outside of the USD inflation, and it's possible if the monetary system continues to go poorly that Bitcoin can be seen as an exit.

I would imagine they probably have maybe 5% set aside that can be accessed quickly if needed, like in a safe in their cooperate offices or in a local bank. The rest are long-term deposits that will be sitting there for extended periods of time in cold storage.
So they would have 3% in online "hot wallets"
An additional 3-5% in offline "hot wallets" used to recharge the main ones in an emergency within an hour or two
The rest in cold storage scattered around the world.
@_date: 2014-05-19 02:24:48
Not to be that guy, but this is pretty relevant. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:56:52
This. While the cold storage OP listed is the "holy grail" of storage, it's simply many times more complicated and more places you can slip up than paper wallets. Just print them from an offline computer onto an offline printer (chromebooks work excellently here, but you have to trust "google" with your keys), and you have a series of addresses you can use. Simply scan them into a online wallet provider like blockchain.info to spend the coins in seconds, and when you want to deposit more, send them to the NEXT paper wallet. Never re-use the same offline address.
@_date: 2014-02-02 12:24:53
The current market cap could not be sustained at all if there were a period of zero trade activity. There will ALWAYS be coins being traded on exchanges, and the market cap will always be fluctuating. Plus miners don't immediately sell their coins so their representation to the market price is not instant. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 09:46:21
I'm not sure if it's here, but I Goddamn do hope we are in sight. Were close though, if you're buying now you're in a great position for the next bubble. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:38:49
Still, I can only assume that they have variable fluctuations for how much is stored online. The more volatility is in the networks and the more transactions they get, they transfer some of the coins from cold storage to their hot wallets.
Add to that, while many of their coins may be in bank vaults around the world, they probably have a chunk at their local office that can be loaded up in minutes if necessary.
AFAIK they handled the last crash pretty well so it can't be THAT bad.
@_date: 2014-02-15 12:16:19
@_date: 2014-04-02 10:31:45
1163 --&gt; 382 is 67% just FYI. And it took two weeks to fully crash instead of the 48 hours April did. 
Deflation is bad for a currency, yes. Bitcoin will not always be deflationary though, it won't take very long for the # of coins minted to make up a tiny and more or less irrelevant fraction of the total supply, and eventually the number of lost coins through various mechanisms will outpace the number of coins generated in mining. 99.99% of all BTC ever will be mined by 2040, not 2140. After the next decade or so, new Bitcoin minting will become more or less irrelevant as the network transitions over to transaction fees to support itself.
@_date: 2014-04-03 08:55:19
Well you had a solid decision and you got in early enough (overall) it doesn't really matter. If you were from the single digit days then I am very much impressed that you stuck around this long.

I think the most instutional investment has been done is on a personal level, no companies have really set their feet into the marketplace. Party because they can't (how do they dump millions in?), but partly because of historical "pride" or whatever. The few people who do see the opportunity probably have started investing starting last fall and into the November bubble.

The remittance market is a very big area where it can take over, yes, but it is a multi-party problem. You need local exchanges in the destination country to be able to exchange Bitcoin for the local currency. These simply do not exist yet as we only have a handful of global exchanges right now.
I think that several years down the road there will be &lt;3 global exchanges that handle most of the day-to-day transactions, probably denominated in dollars. Then there will be countless micro-exchanges that are specialized in their own countries banking laws and currency that locals can exchange their money for.

A quick google answers your understanding of the concept:
It's basically a way to measure volume of coins weighted by how long they have spent in the wallet. IF they were sitting in there, in this case, for almost 3 years, that's a pretty big amount of time so they will be weighted very heavily.

Coinbase is neither an exchange nor a trading platform. They are at best a wallet service that sells Bitcoins. 
An "exchange" is an organized market where PEOPLE buy &amp; sell to PEOPLE. At Coinbase, you are buying &amp; selling to Coinbase. And especially with the multi-day delay, it can hardly be classified as a trading platform.

How would it be irreversible? They mentioned in their release that it's fixable in the long term, and besides it's a flexible coding language. If a problem occurs people will be motivated to fix it and roll it out into an update to the ecosystem.
I don't think it's unfixable.

This reminds me of the Vault of Satoshi giving out gold memberships to people when they launched their services.

Because the volatility and volume are both dropping off..  We aren't breaking highs or lows and are forming a very big pennant (triangle) if you look on the daily chart. When that consolidates and chooses a direction, because of how damn big it is, it will be a powerful move once it gets going.

To be honest, I really don't care either way. It's still using the system and sending micropayments around! HOWEVER, transaction fees make that kind of tipping pretty much useless unless you're tipping dogecoins.

Same here. I consider myself lucky that I caught wind of this during the last bubble in April. I picked up LTC when they were $4 &amp; $2 in April, and then BTC @ $130 &amp; $170 last summer before this bubble. While the monetary gains have been great, and I've learned how to successfully day-trade (I'm up 170% on my budget!)...
The knowledge I've picked up is priceless, of which the OP touched on almost all of them.

While you aren't wrong, the market does move in cycles. These things do  tend to happen again and again. The psychology of the market is shifting, bad news is met with less crashes and good news actually starts causing rallies. Right now both have small effects, but soon it will be switched to a bullish attitude. People have an excuse to buy now instead of needing an excuse to sell.

What he is trying to say is that the dotcom bubble did burst, yes, but it did not crash to zero. The companies and stocks that were part of the bubble, well the ones that made it, are now part of the broader tech sector as the entire industry evolved and changed as the technology progressed in time. 
The same thing will happen to Bitcoin, in the end. Dotcom bubble of the 90's, housing bubble of the 00's, and dare I call it the Bitcoin bubble of the teens? By no way and form do I say that Bitcoin will grow to be as big as to have a decade named after it, but there is a slim (and not zero %) chance it could happen. Everyone here would and should hope that it does happen and our wildest dreams come true, because if Bitcoin does grow to that size... Well, my friends, we will all be very rich.

They don't choose which ones get included? they draw as many as possible from the open pool of transactions. 
The block reward is there to initially support mining and distribute Bitcoins in the early day of the currency, and segway into transaction fees supporting the network.
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:32:26
You can technically have 4FA required to withdraw coins. 
You need your password and google authenticator to login to the site, google authenticator and email confirmation to withdraw coins and then SMS\google auth &amp; GPS\IP location security on email with a different password to confirm the withdrawal. 
If someone can hack through all of that I won't even be mad, I'll be amazed.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:59:47
While this is a very good answer, here is a far more technical and accurate answer as to why 21xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx was chosen. The real reason is floating point calculations (a way of computers doing math).

How do you know it didn't go up because of it? I'm not saying it was the only factor, but it sure as hell did go through another publicity bubble during that time.
I'm gambling that will happen again with this NASCAR thing. It probably won't be as big, but even 92 --&gt; 150... 
@_date: 2014-05-25 20:09:47
True, Gox was market leader during that time and everyone else was just playing follow the leader. Same for China as well, they developed dominance which still exists now. But you're right the other exchanges wouldn't have gotten there without someone bringing them up, simple arbitrage opportunity really. 
My overreaching point is that they pulled the market price up... overall, and rather dramatically. When they start purchasing Bitcoin, according to todays release, the price NEVER starts seriously going down for a period like we saw after the bubble pop of $32 and now $1162. Awhen Gox was buying BTC, the price was always either flat or going up. The crash we saw after April was extremely short lived and was pumped up by more buying on Gox.
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:09:07
I actually think you're wrong, I think they will be at an enormous premium. Because just Bitcoins will be able to be withdrawn, and they're already talking about a limited queuing system, most people will be scrambling to get their BTC out of the site. That means almost nobody in their right minds would trade BTC for fiat money, and that there will simply be a lack of sellers on the market. That combined with people wanting to get their fiat money out of the exchage and we probably will see an exorbanant rise in price. 
Gox probably will make money hand over first on that too by doing insider trading and buying bitcoins with dollars and selling them on their own exchange for a 25% markup. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 23:11:07
There are plenty of "perks" you get for allowing them to keep your millions (or billions) of dollars.
@_date: 2014-01-27 11:00:05
Let me try to expand on what a block is, I feel there are more explanations too. A block is a bunch of Bitcoin transactions that are "grouped" together. Bitcoin miners are constantly competing to be the one to solve the puzzle and actually get the reward for "publishing" this block. When this block is mined, it propagates through the p2p network and shows up as "confirmations" for a payment.
@_date: 2014-05-05 17:38:17
They will fight it tooth and nail. I'm surprised it hasn't had more resistance so far. You can't stop the protocol, that's impossible, but it's far easier to do social engineering and remove peoples perceptions of it's use and prevent it from being adopted by the mainstream. 
The problem is that it only takes one bank to break away from the herd with the lure of profits to enable the stampede. Once there are cheaper profit margins, the incentive is there to deviate. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 01:51:04
Here is a slightly more accurate version.
@_date: 2014-01-01 02:41:08
The bank wire transfer takes several days to arrive at Coinbase, even though it's taken out of your account immediately. That's the problems between the old banking system and what Bitcoin provides.
It is possible to use an exchange (bitstamp, btce) and buy bitcoins on those sites too.
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:30:13
During the bubble it was about 3-5 days actually. 
What happened is that the silk road caused alot of publicity as that site went up in flames. the price recovered very quickly, and stayed rock solid... then the bubble started. I really do wonder what will happen over these next few weeks.

Ebay had, on it's website, an informative video on Bitcoin many months ago. And the CEO of Paypal has made many remarks on Bitcoin in the past (Ebay = Paypal). 
But this may cover many topics here, but this is from a major firm on wall street. Bitcoin is no longer a naysayer on the sidelines, it's making headways in a big way.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:01:53
I don't think you're understanding what Bitcoin even is. Mining only exists to process transactions, and is mostly irrelevant from the price evaluation. The price changes because people buy\sell it, people enter the market and companies entering the space as people buy in. That changes prices. Mining doesn't.
This entire thread you have not been able to articulate exactly what you think the problem is, which is making me think that A) This "problem" doesn't exist or B) you don't understand Bitcoin what-so-ever.
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:20:05
In any regard, I honestly don't care what they end up saying, I just would rather be rid of Gox at this point. The article raised many good points, simply by the fact that they have not responded and vouched for their BTC holdings is a huge red flag, and in this deregulated business where they have already been documented to having $5 million seized from them just before withdrawal problems started means things are going wrong on the inside. 
As bad as it is I'm just glad I don't have any of my money on there. Never have, never will.

@_date: 2014-01-24 02:38:58
You're thinking about a closed loop system, how does it keep growing and meanwhile paying for transaction fees after the block reward stopped? 
It's irrelevant, transaction fees are just recycled into the network as miners will have to sell the coins to other people to pay for operating expenses to run the mining machines.
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:34:44
I personally only think that cold storage (offline) is the best security. It's what I use for my coins.
Also, I'm not going to ganter into taking your coins man. It may be some random on the internet and I may trust you, but I'm just not taking the risk that that indeed is a legitimate file. Anyone else is free too though!

I was under the impression it doesn't need the substantial I\O boost. The blockchain is 25GB in size now, so I would have to grab the 3rd tier server which is $26\month which is outrageous for a VPS to host a Bitcoin node. 
I would love to go with this OVH box, but it doesn't quite have enough disc space.
This KS-1 would be excellent. Not sure if I need a whole dedicated server spec though.

I understand the culture is different there for how the government regulates things; but so far all of the news from china has been confusing. The last official statement I remember seeing was in December during the bubble which gave a completely arbitrary date of January 31st which everyone freaked out about. Now there is April 15th which is fast approaching. 
In truth there is no way to know what exactly is going on there. Personally, the difference between $280 and $430 buy-in isn't a huge difference for me since I'm a long-term holder but I'm still very curious as to why there hasn't been any sort of concrete evidence yet. The most we've heard in the last few weeks is "phone calls from banks" or "trusted insider" or "message from the bank from the bank from the third party provider". 
@_date: 2014-03-13 10:22:15
This adds the potential for identity tracing however. There IS a linkage between the people which is traceable through the blockchain. I'm no expert but wouldn't it seem like that would be a trackable link if you put enough time into it?
The incentive, if it works and is anonymous, would increase the networks utility I'm sure.

"Implied fees due to structured block rewards from mined coins" would be a little higher. We pay roughly $40 in transaction fees with the rate at which new coins were mined, though this figure goes down every day and the network can scale up massively and fixed new coin mining simply will take up a smaller role.

I'm sure the community as a whole would appreciate the translation of news announcements as they get posted, there are not many people who are as fluent or available as you are for translations. But that sounds great, I imagine it's quite the competition between you guys and Huobi to see who can develop their ideas first. Best of luck!
One thing I particularly like about you guys... is LTC\CNY loves to lead the market and I don't think many people know that. They begin movements before Huobi or your BTC\CNY market does and 90% of the time they are right... They're my best indicator for day trading and knowing the direction of the market. Don't stop supporting Litecoin!
@_date: 2014-04-12 22:34:50

I am honestly shocked you give cryptsy that high of a rating. They have had 2 or 3 site outages in the last week, withdrawals across almost all their currency pairs are starting to take days to complete or even require a message to their support to get them solved. I do not think their charts are good at all, and they frequently break on half of the coins I have traded, plus they scale horribly. Their trading engine and site lag like crazy more often than not, and their trading volume is a fraction of what it used to be because they lost most of the volume to mintpal (who run a much better and quicker site). 
@_date: 2014-05-25 06:50:12
They do here. Have you even looked at any long term charts for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-05-22 22:41:55
$2200? Only twice the previous ATH? Bit shallow eh. 
My guess is around $5000. I took the average of 220 peoples guess on a poll of what they thought the next bubble would be and it was $4900. And indeed, there is a good chance that there will be outside economic pressure as the financial system isn't in good shape ATM.

Until Gox is proven to be solvent, the worries of putting new money into a sinking ship will continue to keep the price at a low.
There is a reason why Gox has dropped from 360 to 310, and the price on every other exchange hasn't even sneezed. The 4000BTC buy order fucked up too, the lowest bid price never rose when you look at the 15m charts.
Also, it looks like it just touched the 310 floor *again*. How many times is this going to bounce off before it resets?

But how do you know what coins or transactions are being used for each of those? Aside from assigning arbitrary numbers there is no way to know. And 100% speculation would not be day trading volume, because there are things like HFT, off-market transactions (a-la Coinbase and big institutional buys), and even just typical merchant transactions. 
That's why assessing the value of the network, IMO, is near impossible. To be honest, the price is the most accurate representation we have. It crowd sources the collective guesses of everyone on the network, and human psychology has a cool trick where groups or crowds of people who all guess at a topic, the average of their guesses is pretty damn accurate.
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:23:53
The outside attacker theory is completely insane because for them to be slowly draining Mt.Gox of coins, Marky MArk and his staff would have to have been completely ignorant to the point that 75% of their TOTAL cold storage holdings were being completely drained by anonymous accounts with fictitious information that was not relayed by the bank. And this went on for months, not days. Add to that fact that Willie was turned in reverse in the final days of Gox to drive the price down.
There are more things at play here.
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:02:47
Conspiracy theory time so put your caps on people.... But what if it's some insider or a well connected whale from gox selling sub $200 coins for just about 3x profit. Why the fuck not? People have been guessing there has been insider arbitrage going on for weeks since this MTgox debacle, and could be one of the most clearly obvious examples of it.
That wall was originally worth getting on for 6 million dollars. Now just 5000 coins are left.

That's the kicker that got me. Gox announced these problems to the world first, so they have known about and could have been working on this (already documented) problem for the longest. But just about every other exchanges out there either A) had already planned for and fixed the problem, or B) fixed the problem within 72 hours. Gox is still delaying people, still postponing...

Why migrate to different blockchains? with that logic we should have a coinbase blockchain and a Circle blockchain and a Bitfinex blockchain... While this is a interesting theory this is in NO way a unified front and has a bigger fragmentation of the entire ecosystem - not to mention "branding" problems with them competing against each other. 
Not to mention can you roll out systems that make it easy to switch between all of these blockchains easily and exchange value between them before we hit the current blocksize limit?

Dynamic limits pretty much prevent DDOS flooding in the short-term, but they would still fill up all of the blocks and limit the network. What is worse, huge blocks full of spam transactions (very expensive in the long run), or a flood of transactions that halt all activity on the network and break merchant payments?
Look at this thread to see what happens when we fill up blocks... It would be way worse if we experienced even a 100% growth from where we are today, and judging from past history, that can happen in a few weeks out of nowhere.

So you want to increase fees so we don't overload the network... You want to limit it to 3tx per second when the people using the network want to? So basically unless you're rich enough you can't use it? Sounds great to me... Artificial limit suffocating the network. So we're all raving about how this network can process transactions globally for free instantly... oh wait, you need to pay way way more to use it because too many people are using it. The fuck are you on about? Or just trolling.
Oh and by the way, the dynamic fee structure, would require a hard fork to put in place, if the code for it even existed in the first place. And if you had read my article, Mike talked about how it wouldn't even work anyway.

You're focusing too much on the underlying backend of what happened I believe. Bitcoin, at this point and for the forseeable future, is HIGHLY driven on news and speculation. The rally we're seeing right now pushing us frmo the 700's to the 800's, while not as fast or with as much volume as the bubble we just had, is certainly starting to look like a solid and healthy stint of growth. At least right now.
The thing is that good news takes days\weeks to propagate into the market, while bad news is seen immediately with giant red bars. This ETF formation is just the first public marker that Wall St is finally moving money into Bitcoin. I think we're less than 6 months away from major financial institutions starting to move money into Bitcoin. The solidity that we've seen after this crash and China (mostly) exiting the market is incredible. Every bubble will get smaller, and things will stabilize more and more with each increase in price. Such is life with exponential growth.

I've had an idea like this for a long time. You buy a card at wallmart that's akin to a itunes giftcard. The security procedures are already in place to prevent hacking and theft of the "codes" on the cards. You just have to build a webiste around putting the code into their form and submitting a BTC deposit address. 
Would be great if they support Coinbase email addresses too. You could just buy the card, and you can redeem it's cash value (probably -1% fee) in BTC upon settlement either online or whenever you bought it.

More miners does mean supply increases. Faster increase in network speeds mean we are continually over shooting the speed at which we solve block, we typically have been averaging 20% faster for nearly two years now. 
This means we are several months worth of mined bitcoins ahead of where we "should" be due to network growth.

That's a brilliant idea, but boy is that risky to be legitimate. 
Also, what would be great, is you deposit your Bitcoins into a multi-sig address that's held in Escrow for the site. Whenever you make a transaction it validates the current exchange rate worth of Bitcoins to be converted into USD, instead of selling them all at one time and converting it to cash.
Still a great step forward...presuming it's legit.
@_date: 2015-05-08 00:06:42
Great points. We're at the point where you can't really let a "hickup" stall progress - things are stressed enough as it is with the memory of the price decline and Mt.Gox weighing heavily on sentiment. Any delay or flaw in the network that causes performance different than what has existed over the past 6 years will be seen as a downgrade, flaw, and bug by typical users and the media\outside interests in general. 
As Mike said, we can't loose "momentum" especially for something that is as easily fixable with minimal downside compared to the potential problems that it caused. Even I learned something reading Mikes notes, I didn't realize the full ramifications of what would happen if the mempool and transaction backlog got overwhelmed like that - especially on big spikes. 
Bitcoin can't stumble or hickup in the technical sense, and if Mike's arguments hold any water (and by the lack of objections they seem to be airtight); then the path we're currently on will be one big mess. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 03:34:58
Well have you read what will happen if the network keeps growing and the 1MB blocks are the largest that are allowed even if the network has greatly increased tx/s? Doesn't matter about fees, it pretty much will crash the network. The nodes that have the least amount of memory will go first, the unspent tx buffer (whatever it's called) where transactions are sitting in memory waiting to be mined in a block will bloat up as the backlog increases. 
Only the high fee ones will go first leaving a ever-growing pile of low-fee ones building up. There is no method in place to tell clients what fee will give them a "x%" probability of being included in the next 6 blocks, so it will be a literal race to the moon as the backlog increases and people start to panic just to send coins.
With 20MB... this can also happen, but at a much much later time when we've had way more time to implement other network improvements and address more scaling problems. We simply need to do this to buy time to, in my opinion, prevent the entire network from basically crashing.

Recent history* There have not been intentional hard forks since the emergency one early in 2013 to fix the bug that occurred with the updated database. I wonder if that bad experience left many with a bad taste in their mouth... IIRC there hasn't been a true hard fork since then, but there have been less critical soft-forks and such but nothing on the scope of what has been proposed about the blocksize limit.

I have a feeling the massive gains have been more or less realized though, eventually the difficulty will fluctuate with the price as it approaches market equilibrium due to the cost of electricity.

Proof of stake is not a supplement for hashing power. The entire Bitcoin network could be run off of a few GH worth of transaction power; but it's the 100TH\s that we use to SECURE the network from possible attacks.

Well peak throughput is one thing but bandwidth is another, many many ISP's have caps on what they will allow their users use (E.G 250GB\mo, which many servers are already coming close to using). And 30mbps is a common DOWNLOAD speed, not upload. USA typically has asymmetrical connections, I have 25mbps down 5mbps up Comcast connection for example. Not to mention quality of service, using a high % of upload speed will degrade experience.
So? I'm talking about the typical user. You can't extrapolate that out of 300 million people just because 20 or 30 million are "high tier broadband" ready. That still leaves 9 out of 10 random people without access to the ability to run a high-speed node if the network is 3-5x the size it currently is in a few years. 
This is a natural weeding out that must happen as the network grows though as the nodes move to more server-based environments. 
@_date: 2015-05-07 22:29:17
Would you rather be stuck at 1MB or 20MB if you couldn't gain consensus? 
If blocks start filling up transaction queues will start being unreasonable in the mempool and people will start using other alternatives for transactions.... Avoiding the entire point of the Bitcoin network in the first place. It shouldn't cost $100 in the future to get your tx included in the blocks in the future if we scale up at 1MB\block. That's even worse than where we are today.

And it's not like the intention was to scale up the network anyway... You can't run a global payment system on 1MB\10 minutes, there simply is no way to compress the data. Eventually home users will be left behind by the scaling up of the network if they want to run fully integrated nodes. I don't know why there is so much resistance against this.
If home users really want to contribute they can rent a VPS for $5\mo on a 100mbps pipe that is good enough for the next few years.

1) oh shit this fact is starting to leak out... I start seeing alot of people start commenting on this, partly driven by myself because I've been spreading this information quietly too. I realized this pattern months ago when I was analyzing patterns between all of the bubbles we have seen and yes, I do agree that is a very interesting pattern. I would LIKE to assume that it is because of the natural exponential growth of the community and metacalfes law. If the network and the community are growing at a constant rate, the price should undergo growth "bubbles" in activity and peridocity at a regular interval. That's a bit too "regular" for me though, and it seems like this time around we won't be going for another go. I think one of two things will happen. If we do stick to the wave pattern, we will get a repeat of August 2012 and get a mini-bubble that probably won't break $1000 because there isn't a Mt.gox willie pumping the price. Option 2) is that we deviate from the pattern and undergo either another mini-bubble or a full scale bubble in maybe 270 or 300 days. I think the latter is more likely. Pay very close attention to late July because there will be alot of people expecting the pattern to repeat.
2) I think Willie accelerated and pushed the envelope higher than it otherwise should have been, but remember, the other exchanges did naturally achieve these prices on their own. Bitstamp and BTCe were both over $1000 and China actually outpaced Mt.Gox during the November bubble. Think of it like them starting a fire, they provided the kickstarter and everyone else brought the jet fuel. In the end, to be honest, it might have actually been the best thing that could have happened because at the expense of half a billion (in current value) of peoples money we might never have breached $32 again, or it might have taken years longer.
I think we will be following the wave pattern, but it will be in ever slowing amounts as they get shallower and longer between peak and tough. This is consistent with the idea that markets slow down and stabilize as they grow larger and liquidity increases.
Also, let me leave you with a tidbit. Instead of measuring the distances between the peaks... measure the distance between the peak and when the market finishes it's reversal and starts heading up again (e.g like this past month when we switched from bear to bull market) and tell me what you find. I think it's even more alarmingly consistent across the price since day 1.

The 20mb block does effectively kick the can down the road in the scheme of things, buying us one more order of magnitude or bubble of growth before the network catches up to the cap. I still don't see everyone worrying about a true solution until the 20mb limit gets hit again either. Only in crisis do people get motivated. 
Our current block size needs to be addressed though.

So wait, you're saying that as an argument against 20MB or raised block sizes in general, is a theoretical attack against mempools? Versus the *gauranteed* "attack" that is transaction overload if 1MB blocks are allowed to be fully filled up? We can't let the "instant" nature of transactions in the network go away, that is one of the biggest selling points of the protocol and technology, and there is no existing code in the software to let the "free market" of fees organize itself even if we did let blocks fill up and let the market dominate. There is no live bid\ask spread to tell you what fee you must attach to have a 50% chance of making it in the next "x" blocks. 
People will want to use the network. But a very simple and very unnecessary bit of limitations will prevent them from using it in the capacity they want to. It's like having a car with a 6 speed gearbox and telling the driver they can't go out of 2nd because they might get a speeding ticket.

It's laughable... But plausible. The bots on the exchange could have been used to basically inject fake money, hundreds of millions of it, to drive up the price so that there would be ample liquidity to 'cash out' much of the positions the people running the bots had. They already had planned to exist, they had already planned to run the exchange as a fractional reserve. What happened afterward didn't matter and the reported balances didn't match what actually happened in reality. The coins were sold on other exchanges, and the the blowout period started. 
It really is unfortunate that shorting wasn't really possible at this time though. I'm sure much of the China bans Bitcoin period that came afterward was directly in response to shorting becoming available on those exchanges and bitfinex at those times.

Eventually one day you will have to have far larger block sizes. I don't care how efficient the processing mechanism or compression, you can't run a global network on 1 or 20MB "blocks". I'm still not really sure why we're kicking the can down the road when any other technology that will help us is not even in sight yet.
@_date: 2015-05-08 07:20:52


My biggest point. Sure increasing the limit to 20MB might make attacks full of spam even worse... but they already don't even happen at 1MB pretty much ever. The tx fee already makes that a non-issue. 
I think the long-term bigger issue is nodes running 200MB or 500MB blocks that use insane amounts of data per month that are just totally out of reach of the typical user and are more or less limited to server-class computing. That's a problem for an order of magnitude (or a few orders) larger network and I'm sure  there would be services that would allow people to donate money to running nodes or things of that nature.
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:59:06


This is effectively kicking the can down the road... but we must do it. No other tangible solution is in sight that can be rolled out in time to keep up with the expected tx demand. We really don't have that much time.
I am ALL FOR any solutions that help availability and reduce network load lighting network &amp; every other proposal that isn't centralized payment processes taking the load on themselves (*coinbase, changetip*); however, we are months if not years from those solutions and we simply need to buy time.
It would be awfully ironic if the network crashed from TX overload by an arbitrary limit that was not removed\changed simply because of politics. So thank you Gavin for not giving a fuck and pushing on anyway.

@_date: 2015-05-28 00:42:50


Judging by the fact that we have pretty much gone 5-years txDDOS free, I don't think raising the blocksize limit will change it. IT will just make it 20x more expensive to do the same harm.
I think zero fees and that model should remain as it is... Yes including a fee as it stands now will gaurantee it being mined in a block, but some people are really that stringent and don't need to a priority mining block and eventually someone will pick it up.

Hashcash was (one of) them too, it and many other technologies were the pioneer of bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto did what Apple (did) when they launched the ipod and iphone. They both  took various bits of innovation which each in their own respect are very good ideas but useless on their own, and they packaged them into a brilliant matrix that uses the combination in a brand new way. So in a way they each are innovating in their own right because whether you like it or not, Apple completely defined what a smartphone is today.
Bitcoin is both "good enough" and has a very strong network effect that will make it highly likely that if digital currencies succeed in a decentralized manner, it will likely become the de-facto medium of exchange.

No I'm not. Why? 
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:35:54


That's because, AFAIK, there are no criticisms that could live up to that kind of scrutiny. I think Mike summed it up best at the end:




IMO if you start running into capacity problems, attacks on the network by intentionally putting forth transactions that intentionally will not confirm because they have 0 fees and will try and take advantage of processors that don't use confirmations in their services. I'm looking at you Coinbase and Bitpay. This will force everyone to use minimum 1 confirmation on all services regardless of value, which with overloaded blocks may require multiple blocks to be processed before your transaction gets past the backlog, which makes EVERYONE worse off. You no longer go waiting for 10 minutes, you can go hours. I think mike will go far more into depth on his next article. 
This is a problem we are faced with now and the dev's are bringing it up because we're running out of time. Transactions are still growing on the network and we MUST act before we start regularly clipping the 1MB limit.
@_date: 2015-05-08 01:59:32
So it sounds like with my limited knowledge the existing attacks are irrelevant to the size of the block with the current architecture of how the mempool is implemented... so it shouldn't matter in the blocksize discussion right? We're trying to battle the lessor of two evils here.

Generated all of my keys on airgapped brand-new computers on brand new printers that never had been connected to any network; and then completely re-flashed all of the hardware back to stock form after I was done creating keys. The steps I took are huge, but now I have enough private keys for the next few years of use.
That, and always verifying the address of where you are sending coins to is huge. When possible I send test transactions to make sure. I specifically have a chromebook for this exact purpose, I consider it far more secure than Windows based operating systems.

Stop shilling, your arguments make no sense 2hst so ever. 
Limiting the block chain to a artificially slow transaction processing limit is like the same idea of limit king the top speed of cars because the horses will get scared when they're being outrun. It's idiotic. The network must scale as it continues to grow, otherwise there will not be freedom in transaction payments making the network totally useless because the fees to get a transaction that actually is processed are simply too high. Nobody wants to pay 0.1btc fee. 
And nobody will fill up 20mb blocks just like nobody is filling up the current 1mb blocks, it simply costs too much. Did you seriously bring that up into your pointless argument? 
There are ideas to reward the running of a full none that could be looked into to give value to the service those people are providing to the block chain. Having 'centralization' will simply be counteracted by people who care because of incentives. Companies and people will simply run their own full nodes in their own best interest if they ever feel threatened by the low node count or centralization. And disc technology will keep scaling with Moores law for at least 5-10 more years so disc space is not a problem at all. And by the time it does block chain pruning will be easily implemented.

Well at the end of the day you are trying to merge some very different systems and implement network security that was never really needed in the old banking system. The end-user identification and security has never been that important, the security used to be organized around the central servers. So now every thefts can occur from each user in addition to the centralized exchanges. 
That problem is something that is totally new on the internet, and solutions really haven't been developed. You always can have a keylogger on your computer to steal your password to your wallet's private keys. Dedicated hardware security eventually will have to be developed to combat that.

@_date: 2014-01-02 06:47:03
No, that was true, especially in this case. The pictures that have been posted here are outdated, at one point there was over 250BTC for sale at exactly the 819.99 and 820.00 price points, with 170BTC of that being at 820.00. Because the price hits that line multiple times it's obvious that buy orders have hit the line many many times over the last 30 or so minutes, meaning it's been slowly chunked away over time until finally it gets fully bought out and the price can continue upwards.
If that were true, you would see large ask walls supporting the price at the bottom, and you don't see that at all. IF your simpler theory were correct, we would actually see the same effect but in the opposite direction as a whale supports the price from the bottom instead of there being a seller keeping a ceiling on the top.
However, you're right, the last week has been alot of arb trading since the volume is so godamn low. It's difficult to have fun with the markets when things are so boring. That's why I got excited tonight when PPC and NMC got pumped &amp; dumped over at BTCe! I made a nice little profit there.

Really? I've been watching price action fit 18 months on a daily basis, and I know what exchanges lead the market and everything. This entire leg up last night while the USA was sleeping was fueled by finex going crazy. China would edge up a little bit, then finex would just start eating walls and destroying things. Then China would follow later and probably make a few more smaller moves afterward. The exchanges don't all pump at the same time anymore either, China has a little separate style sometimes and they might have a 2nd leg when finex has already topped out.

They can apply a fee to an incoming transaction? But even then you just raise the minimum fee required for a tx to be confirmed; you are STILL loosing transactions at the bottom of the fee structure starting at 0 and working it's way up because there is a constricted amount of resources. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 19:20:37
FAST! Unless you don't include a big enough fee (oh yeah, it's not free anymore) and need to rebroadcast with RBF and your vendor doesn't accept it on 0 confirmation because of the double-spend risk. And then you get super unlucky and get one of those times where there isn't a block mined for an hour. That's always fun.

I think miners sell the vast majority of mined coins when they're mined, not many are hoarded, the price isn't going up and the business is a lot more professional now. They aren't traders. 
However they may use futures to hedge holdings... but again that can be dicey due to exchange risk socialized losses and other factors outside their control.
@_date: 2016-03-22 05:19:44


I think this is where you are falling apart though - the blocksize is not related to the location of the miners or anything like that, it is related to HOW MANY of them there are and the overall size of the entire mining community (e.g the hashrate). The only way they can collude to increase the blocksize is to onboard more mining equipment which is only supported by A) more transactions B) more expensive transactions or C) higher price. The only way they can manipulate those is to flood the blocks with spam transactions or use other methods to inflate fee prices - which I think the developers of the code would shun upon and use measures to prevent them from doing that - no? I don't understand fully the technicals behind that aspect but I think I have the theory. 
I agree with most of your conclusion though, the endgame is general centralization to reduce latency. I'm just not entirely sure if it will all go to one location or if it will be several spread out worldwide (E.G mining interests in china, europe, usa). 


Yes, this is why some HFT firms spent hundreds of millions of dollars laying 1500 miles of fiber lines connecting Chicago to NYC as the bird flies. That shows you the money involved is VAST. Now that system has been written off and replaced by line of sight microwave towers AFAIK. All to gain what, a millisecond? 
I'm mostly interesting in discussing it because I hope that total centralization won't become true... but I'm not sure. Never really concentrated on the total-endgame in that manner. I think that's different than my original issues though - miners won't be able to directly influence the blocksize through the BIP that Bitpay has introduced, what you have brought up is about the endgame centralization of mining.

Based on what Mike Hearn said... there very well could be failure. Loosing critical momentum and critical mass could prove suicidal. Do you really want to take that risk? That vs. doing a early fix that might make the network more centralized, but increasing the size is something we must do in the future so why not now? I very much see it as the lesser or two evils.
@_date: 2015-05-28 04:19:55
I would hardly call trying to guess if your fees are high enough to get your tx ever filled into a block "functioning". 
Have you read this article on what would happen? Spend the time and read this article, it explains exactly what will happen when the limit is reached... and it's scary










So.... going over the limit will basically kill the network. Or do enough damage to ruin the trust we have worked years to build. In what way will having a limited block size engaging these scenarios be good?
@_date: 2015-05-07 23:59:25

And as the number of required companies and services in the field rise, so will the number of full nodes. We technically had a "oversupply" I believe, &gt;5000 is still a big sum of nodes online on the network. Eventually it hopefully will scale relative to the number of users on the network.
Remember, we have had a deflation of the community after the 2013 bubbles. Many people have left and turned off of Bitcoin... but look how big the economy STILL is. Impressive isn't it.
@_date: 2016-03-22 04:14:58
How do you know that is the endgame? Because that is what happened with HFT in the markets? 
But why would colocated miners ensure the blocks are always full of "free" transactions, I don't see why that would be advantageous to them. Curious to see why you think that. 
I know all the HFT firms put their servers next to the main exchanges, but there are still a solid dozen+ main exchanges that trade out there in different locations. NYSE, BATS, etc - not to mention other markets all around the world. Would there be different central repositories of miners in this way? In the end it is all game theory and margin reduction. I'd imagine they'd be in a very cold climate to cut down on cooling costs.
@_date: 2016-03-22 03:45:17


They can't guarantee those transactions will fill their block though will they? You can't guarantee you will mine the next block. The block size is created by the hashrate, not the # of transactions on the network.
There would still be a hard cap to prevent DDOS of the network, but it would scale as the network scaled and this "attack vector" already exists today and isn't constantly being spammed. The times it is spammed it is with transactions with a fee attached to them. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:58:42
Well in this case you are very right, in the last 2 months china has been turning the volume up 100x what it already was. But this isnt the case here... apparently an exchange nobody uses, BIT-X, is reporting volume figures 6x higher than bitfinex, an exchange everyone uses. ok.

Reading ability and reading comprehension are two different things. Code analysis and code comprehension are two different things. Game theory analysis and game theory comprehension are two different things.
Simply put it needs to be a cost benifit analysis. Does the benefit of delaying bigger blocks for (insert all arguments here) outweigh the potential downsides of what that may cause as the network continues to grow (insert arguments here). 
I've known about the problem for a while but I've become much more educated about it over the last... manic week and I have to say that I'm in the camp that some action needs to be taken. The risks are simply too high to have some artificial limit "stall" progress and potentially cause problems within the network. And from what I've heard, the potential problems of not doing anything are far greater than the potential problems that come by making the suggested and popular changes (E.G 20MB).
We can't disrupt the status quo of how the network runs. If you do, you jeopardize the entire network IMO because trust and momentum are lost. Trust not only in the code itself, but trust in the developers and community to come together and make a decision about what must be done to continue to better ourselves. We have had times like this before, most recently Ghash.io. The community made a unified effort and fixed the problem. And before that the emergency unintentional 0.8 blockchain fork in 2013.
If we go down like this... I really don't want it to. Failure from growing pains because of politics. How ironic.

And there goes the fungability of bitcoin. Your coins are worth nothing unless you pay in the top 10% of everyone else who is paying fees. So if there is competition for scarce resources (processing of your tx) the fees will skyrocket or everyone will just leave.
Not a good idea limiting the Mclaren F1 to 2nd gear no more. The network is capable of it, sure a few stones will chip the paint by going faster and you'll burn more gas but it's pointless and almost harmful to be maxing out at such a low potential when shifting up is so easy.

You're trying to find a solution to a problem that is entirely avoidable. It's like trying to do rocket science to find some miracle fix to heal a cut when a simple bandaid will do. 
And loosing 80% of nodes would be awful, it would make the already worrisome centralization problem people are using to contest increasing the block size by WAY WAY worse. IMO we'd loose more nodes to this than we would by increasing the block size.
@_date: 2016-03-22 03:49:21


In the endgame, it entirely depends "how big" bitcoin and the resulting blocks will get. If, 10 years down the road, the blocks are still hovering in the 5-10MB range, that really won't be a lot of data being transmitted with how network technology is coming up - especially since any mining situation will be in some sort of datacenter and getting a dedicated high speed connection will be extremely easy. Eventually, the cost of internet connection will factor into the mining cost equilibrium - just like power and capex and overhead and all the other factors. Some people will tradeoff getting cheaper power and sacrifice internet connectivity because that fits their plan. The cheaper cost of power overwhelms the downside of more orphans and all the things that come with a poor connection.

Network security is directly tied to the hashing power the way the current system is setup, so running your own private network will still make you very vulnerable to attackers especially if there is a more powerful network running the same hashing script. You have a security incentive to use the biggest network to prevent an attack.
@_date: 2015-05-27 00:13:47
Why wouldn't they do it now? There are some (stupid :() miners who run tiny blocks and hardly include any tx, but today there aren't really problems with miners capping their blocksizes to 10kb so they get that tiny edge.
This same logic applies to if we raise the limit to 20MB. We wouldn't find the vast majority of people limiting their sizes to 200kb because the increase revenue from fees should outweigh the speed and resource differential. This effect will become increasingly powerful as mining rewards make up a larger portion of the block reward after each halving event. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:20:02




Strong this. the blocksize limit is NOT ready at all in any way for a period of even moderate growth (mini-bubble). The moment the blockchain itself starts having problems people will be kicking themsleves in the foot as the things many have expressed start to come true. Nodes going offline from huge memory loads of unconfirmed tx, transactions taking hours from the backlog, out of control fees as people try to throw money at the problem to get their transaction confirmed (and there is no way to provide "this fee will guarantee you be mined in next 6 blocks"). It will be chaos, and it will happen in weeks.

Technically it was or could have been in the earlier days. There was 50kb reserved in every block for "zero fee" transactions that has either A) been removed or is B) being removed IIRC (I could be wrong, someone fact check me?). 




Yeah for your coffee and low-value tx your rules pretty much say you can run the risk of doublespend  because it's not likely someone will attack it like that. Plus, I'm sure there are metrics they can apply to judge the risk of a transaction judging on where it comes from or other metrics (paging Bitpay and Coinbase). But wasn't the whole notion of RBF transactions that they are more easy to double-spend 0-confirm by replacing it with one with a higher fee? Or do I not understand the technicals. I remember reading something saying that was a drawback of having it be included to combat the ever-filling blocks and growing fee market.

That is my argument yes. And Galvin has said this solution is simply kicking the can down the road and I think he's right. But ANY other solution that has been proposed is years away and has not even been properly developed or launched yet and is in no way shape or form able to be rolled out en-masse to cope with the current problem. At this current rate which is showing no signs of slowing down we WILL run into major problems starting next yr.
These solutions will, over time, over years, optimize transactions and reduce the on-chain load as the protocol is refined. But until then we need more time, and that's exactly what raising the blocksize limit will do. But you're right it doesn't solve the underlying problem, but I think innovation over time will help. One service here, another solution there all add up to significant savings over time.
@_date: 2016-03-25 20:15:24
What he's saying is, that when markets go sideways for an extended period of time, it's more "noticeable" when they finally do move and that gets a LOT of people wanting to enter positions because of it. Bitcoin has been at $410ish for 2 weeks now, if we suddenly pop to $440 that gets a whole lot of eyes and a whole bunch of people who sold\went short now are very interested in buying. 
That's the concept of stability in markets at any rate. Long periods of sideways, when they are broken, are very obvious and often trend-setting.

Well the thing is I noticed it at my watermark, 7:05, and I tried to find it multiple times yesterday when I made the posts... but I never could. I knew it was important and wanted to look into it more but couldn't find it. But at the end of the day it's right infront of you lol.
I'm pretty much with you, changing the blocksize is fucking stupid, but I do agree with some of his conclusions. Orphaning is a "natural" blocksize limit in of itself, and eventually, the network will have to support itself only from fees. That much is beyond question. It's just how do we get there, how much mining centralization do we support, etc. But the big game I just see being played now is divide and conquer. And lots of infighting. I see the same... structured megaposts, the same FUD, the same types of articles promoting each sides like they're all made by the same person. I've started cataloging headlines and it's pretty scary how both sides look the same from orbit (without delving into beliefs on who is "right"). 
Well it's distorted facts on both sides. I try and remain impartial on so many things, and I've sat back and just tried to remain to my core values. Just like political parties in the USA, I don't agree or "side" with either, the problem is that both sides are right to some degree. Just... to different extents and totally subjective to the situation. It very much is 50 shades of grey.

Miners and hashrate react to the price. Price does not change directly based on how many people have ASIC's chugging away.
However, eventually, yes. I would imagine in a totally perfect system where margins are super compressed, temperature swings would affect how much hashrate people run their systems at to manage overheating and thermal loads. They may use the waste heat like this, to heat homes and offset their baseline marginal cost and become more profitable. But that's a long way off. We're nowhere near that now.

Too hard line, I see a lot of posts and topics that remind be of vindicated political blogs from Democrats and Republicans, lots of hate speech and broad generalizations of 'those people'. It's a pretty toxic way to go about things.

IMO it's a fight about political control of the codebase and a fight over social control of the community and social networks of the participants. Everyone is vying for power, either directly or indirectly because they either want it, or they think their "vision is best". Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. 
But as long as enough people disagree about what should be done, nothing serious (e.g any hardfork or even segwit activation) won't get done. And the network will slip into stagnation with lots of wasted effort on infighting vs. the goals we all wanted to achieve 3 or 4 years ago. Remember those goals? Posting about taking on Paypal, and the banks (as deluded as they were) they were something to strive for. Now we're fighting about beating "them" on the "other side" on "that other forum" (people in and both say this). 
This divide is why we have different political parties in most every country - except North Korea where our Glorious Leader wins every election with 100% of all party members voting for his Glorious leadership to be extended in the democratic elections to bring the country strong into the future. The divide is because people are different, they have different experiences and inputs that results in them making different decisions to the problems presented by the world.

$195? It was in the $160's depending on the exchange you look at. Bitstamp hit $152. Janurary 14th. 
We then retested it at $166 on Finex on August 18th due to a cascading margin call event. Everywhere else hit roughly $194.

Any deviation of the existing Bitcoin code that intends to use the existing blockchain and history of transactions is a hard fork, not an altcoin. An altcoin is the socially acceptable term that the community uses to describe a fresh blockchain with  a new\modified set of rules (however minor\major). You perfectly know well the difference between the two, and if you don't, most would bring into question your ability to be called a "bitcoin expert". You are manipulating the definition of these words. Why?

Gotta agree with this. The emergence of a fee market is the bigger of the two changes compared to segwit\blocksize increase IMO. It impacts nearly every part of the game theory and network. Miners, nodes, software, exchanges... everything. 
EDIT: At the end of the day yes a fee market is supposed to overtake the block reward as a suitable security against network attack as coin inflation slowly slows as the years progress, but there hasn't been much of any talk about WHEN this switch over should occur, how much of a spam tx should be limited, where this cutoff should be, etc. Additionally, those who propose that making a fee market means more rewards for miners... economics 101 is any artificial limit imposed to a network that disrupts the natural equilibrium of supply (block space) or demand (transactions) creates a deadweight loss (total fee revenue) [See here](

It still uses renewable energy generation capacity that would otherwise be used for homes\factories\etc. It's not like this is free unused capacity just sitting there (sometimes yes, but not as a whole). 
But yes, overall as a ecosystem it is good it comes from renewable. I'm going to guess it's almost all hydro power, since that has incredible reliability and is incredibly cheap when you're near the source. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:11:58
This is what probably has been the persistent cheap bid of transactions for the last several months. Exchanges are probably cleaning up their wallets.
When fees were high, these funds were basically unspendable. But now that you can send 1 sat\byte transactions, it becomes economical to clean them up and consolidate the funds.

No they don't all use OTC. I really don't want to sound pretentious here, but I know of and have seen plenty of people managing very large positions. Often on Bitfinex, these 500btc orders are only part of their posistion. Shit, we had someone marketsell 1000 btc on Bitstamp at the bottom at 6550.
OTC doesn't allow you to exchange for altcoins either.
You can place a 500 coin bid, then a bunch of hidden asks right above it... use the bid to make your asks get filled. There are many layers deep to this man. I've been in this space a really long time as a trader, there's shit that goes down you wouldn't imagine that's way worse than this whole "spoofing" narrative which at the end of the day doesn't do much

Well shit, we're going to have to go after guys on Bitstamp too. And GDAX (though GDAX is more subtle about it). And OKEX, and Bitmex, Bitflyer, 796, and holy shit, especially okcoin and huobi throughout 2015 and 2016 before zero fees were removed. Shit, I remember in 2013 when LTC was worth $40 at the top, someone was "spoofing" the BTC-e LTC/BTC books with a 100,000 LTC order. Kept keeping it a little bit above the spread to make people afraid, chasing the market down, then pulling it.
I've been an orderbook trader for the last 4 years. This shit is commonplace and pretty amateur. If you truly want to manipulate the market, there are far more devious games being played with hidden orders, iceberg grouping of orders to hide liquidity or paint a narrative in the book that is not just a flat 1000 limit bid. And 4 million, 9 million dollars isn't that much money. I've seen probably 20 or 30 million placed then pulled in the books earlier in 2017 before.
It happens on every exchange man. Bitfinex is beaten by okex many times. You'll see 20, 40, 100, 400! million dollar orders get flashed over there.

Markets are the sum of all buyers and sellers. Periods of sideways and consolidation happen when there is am equilibrium between all oft them, where the balance of people willing to sell is met by buyers willing to buy. 
If one side gets out of balance however, like now, the amount of sellers willing to sell coins at that price range ends and if the imbalance is quite high you get rapid price appreciation to the next level. Add to that, traders and margin people see a big price rise and need to adjust their positions, adding to the fomo. Other people see it as a start of a trend so they buy, etc, etc.

This. Though it is worth being said that the uranium used for them is not exactly unlimited in supply. It's a VERY rare isotope and basically on par with platinum and silver in it's rarity in the earths crust.
But yeah, most of the plants in operation now were built I think mostly in the 70's through the 90's? I think when Chernobyl happened that put a huge halt to new plants being constructed. I'm by no means an expert in this at all - but that feels like a REALLY long time to be operating on the same basic designs that were implemented before we really had computers.

Couple things, because holy moley there is so much wrong information in this thread.
1) transaction volume on the blockchain may, or may not, have an impact on price. But broadly it's only on smaller amounts. If someone moves 100,000 BTC, they aren't going to sell those on the open market. That's just not how it works at those sizes. 
2) Correlation does not imply causation. Especially correlation from one datapoint.
3) There are plenty of large transactions like this that don't impact the price.
4) Even if this was one person moving coins to the market to sell, they single-handedly would have made up 100% of the volume of the top exchanges during the dump. Nobody else can trade, just them. That's not how that works. 
5) like 7 people in the world actually have that many bitcoin, personally. Basically every other entity that has control of 20, 50, 100k bitcoin is an exchange or some conglomerate of many people. Typically those don't liquidate, everything, all at once. And again - trades of this size do not happen on the open market. They settle in OTC. 
6) I haven't seen people talking about major deposits into exchange wallets, which are monitored.
The dump was technical. We spend 3 weeks bleeding into support every single day, and eventually it came to the point where everyone's stoploss orders just triggered a cascade. One after the other. We see this all the time normally, but typically they're smaller and have much less of an impact. This was just a particularly large one that even daily timeframe traders would act on.
Me and every technical trader I know were watching that level and had our trades setup accordingly.

Bitcoin land they don't have time to wait until the next day. When the margin call\liquidation point is met, the position must be forcefully liquidated immediately to prevent loss of funds from either A) the loaner on P2P swaps or B) the exchange on "futures". 
Bitfinex sort of decided to use margin call as their terminology, but okcoin futures typically use liquidation price. Margin call is the more popularly used "term" for getting "rekt" because it is more known to more people of what it is.

lol we pay $300\mo in gas during the peak winter months. We pay about $100\mo in electricity to cool the house in the peak summer months. 
Power is so crazy cheap where I live for some reason.
Won't heat the house but it helps reduce the load on the furnace and it doesn't have to, it helps offset the cost of hte electricity use of the miner.
@_date: 2015-04-19 20:57:20
Yeah I know insulation can make better ROI in that regard but that has already been done to as much as it can, any more would require complete gutting of the house and siding.
@_date: 2015-04-19 20:56:38
I've already run the numbers and I understand how the mining ROI works. I have a significant advantage because the electricity will be heavily discounted by the heat produced so I have a leg up above people who are just mining to mine.

I don't know if this person is objective or knows anything but he said that the payouts have a rough ETA of late this year (he said September as a month on the topic).
We'll see as the timeline gets closer but it will be interesting to see the impact on the market of 200k BTC. I'd estimate the majority will get claimed, I'm not sure what the estimated % is. But many of those people I bet will want to get "what they can" by market selling coins upon delivery. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 13:23:50
Not sure, I just stole the code from someone else. Google's data seems good enough why not just use theirs? Is there any specific reason you want stamp of all the exchanges out there? 
@_date: 2015-04-28 05:43:55
I think the most likely situation was where a large account holder had their account with mostly fiat hijacked; and the hacker was trying to convert all the money to BTC so they could withdraw it ASAP before the owner or the exchange took steps to stop them. 
They did it slowly at first to not raise any alarms, but eventually just wanted to finish it all at once I suppose. Unlikely an intentional pump to run shorts; the risks and slippage simply added up to be too great. At a minimum 5000 coins were market bought at a significant premium meaning your other antics on the other exchanges would have had to net you hundreds of thousands in profits. Difficult on what ended up being a $10-15 move.
It's the best explanation I have heard yet.

Log scale isn't talked about enough.
Point and case: 
@_date: 2015-04-19 17:56:18
Very rudimentary
590w of power is about $30\mo for me; and the heating output of the unit itself is very low but the fact that it is running 24\7 makes it compound into a much more powerful thing. Electricity is very cheap where I live for some reason (we get amazing rates, A\C in the summer is stupid cheap), so using it like this is great. Especially considering we will get off-peak rates by using it in the night too.
I haven't fully run the numbers but I expect the electricity costs to mostly be offset by gas savings. I will run more finite numbers when I can get legitimate numbers on the bills in the coming quarter.
@_date: 2015-04-19 13:21:26
Not necessarily. It would be demand driven, it would have different rates of buying because of the influx and variable demand from China. If they really were remarketing coins from Mt.Gox, then there would be demand peaks in accordance with volatility. What those charts show is that the bot ran regardless of how many BTC were being traded at the time, so times when price action was flat it was still buying. That isn't a characteristic that would happen IMO, especially well into January after the bubble burst.
@_date: 2015-04-21 21:23:49
@_date: 2015-04-19 21:01:55
Possibly. The fan for the furnace is pretty imbedded in the unit, I will have to investigate it more this weekend but I don't think that's an option. I can always just hook up a 2nd unit downwind from my miner before it gets to the main air vents.
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:37:10
Depends on how you sway it to be honest. If you time the markets correctly and probably use one like DRK where there is good liquidity, as long as you aren't trying to wash 500BTC or something stupid you should be able to do it with relative ease.
Intensive process though, seems like a lot of steps to do.
Also inb4 everyone in this thread is on some list
@_date: 2015-04-19 21:00:34
lol I know I will need another fan to push it though. I still have a few ideas about exactly what I will do. But putting a much higher CFM fan downwind before the main airvent will go a long way, and the heat adds up at the end of the day. Having it running 24\7 will produce enough heat compared to several desktop PC's, and one PC is more than enough to very reasonably heat my room and it only uses a couple hundred watts of power.
@_date: 2019-09-30 20:19:21
Because the risk profile is different than just holding bitcoin. Some people want that profile. More "traditional", since it's just a business with inputs and outputs. Easier to raise capital and leverage up.

Those will prevent air going down the wrong way when it isn't running but the miner will be running 24\7 so they will pretty much be always open. 1 way vents won't particularly work. I will try and angle the exhaust into the central air system so it "flows" in a better direction but I will have to do some testing to see how much airflow it forces in.

Noise isn't an issue, I've seen some mods where you can replace fans with more silent versions and my ambient basement temps are quite cool (~50F) so running it won't be too much of an issue.
You are right about electricity being expensive to heat though. But I am taking otherwise wasteful heat from the mining process and using it so there is SOME utility to it.

Yeah actually looking back you may be right. Still though I wonder if it would be worth it because look at how much heat a simple gaming computer will put out, it will completely warm a room in my house during the winter months with the vents closed. And that is about 400w of computing power. Scale that up and you have a usable place for all that otherwise wasted heat to go.

Interesting. I didn't expect a reply from someone in that position! 
I am most interested in the market implications of the distribution at the end of the day because I believe many of the people may have lost hope and will just want to get any money back that they can when they receive the coins. That will be substantial sell pressure even if only 20-40% of the distributed coins are sold.

It's almost perfectly efficient? I didn't quite realize. I had assumed that some input energy would be lost for the actual work that is being done (to protect the 2nd law of thermodynamics). Maybe it's such a little amount that at the end of the day it doesn't look like much.
I did some digging and it preliminary seems that it is almost all converted into heat energy. Can't find any actual conversions
umbers, but just general stuff and the way it was being talked about seems like it's a very close conversion. 
Good to know.

FYI even at residential electricity rates, if you're in a cold climate (think Canada) it's actually decently close. AFAIK, the higher electricity prices for residential consumers is offset by the savings in heating costs by actually using the heat output of the miner instead of wasting it. If you're in an area with statistically cheaper electricity, it's quite feasible. 
Probably should lower the fan RPM and install some sort of muffler. 
It's tough to actually do the proper math to figure out because I wasn't able to find out the BTU heat output of a typical miner (S9).
However, I think the best use case for this is actually factories or big buildings who can better handle the noise output and also get cheaper industrial rates for electricity.

Please learn how these futures markets work before bitching about socialized losses... 
Margin calls and liquidations can't be market sold into the books because of how illiquid the futures markets are. Simple fast. It would cause cascading margin calls every day and would make them untradable. So liquidations are instead set as limit orders not market orders. This is the only way to let the market operate and remain solvent. 98% of the time people sell into these limit orders...but not always. In super parabolic moves sometimes we go right past them and they never get filled, and then 1+1 does not = 2 on their platform anymore. Cue socialized losses. That loss is deducted from the the profits that week, so if you made 5BTC profit typically a couple percent will be taken depending on how much loss needs to be distributed. If you had negative RPL that week you loose nothing. Only profits are taken.
Nothing is stopping them from "making up" fake margin call walls to take profits from people... but I don't typically see this happening. My intuition, I think more often than not this is not done.

Not good enough. The only way you KNOW that your keys are safe is if they're made on a computer that never reaches the internet again. Ever. If you just disable it while creating keys, some obscure hacking could technically cache the keys and upload them again once it's back online. This is a remote possibility, but not zero.
This also includes removable media (USB, CD, flash drive, etc) going from the host computer to one with internet.

The problem of inter exchange Arbitrage has always been fiat transfers not crypto. Cutting a 10x6 minute process to a minute or two isn't as valuable as reducing the fiat transfer rates from days/weeks. The latter would do way more to stabilize price movements like you guys are saying.

I have a question myself... would this be a system that "institutional banks" as it were would be able to use this? And if so, with a sidechain like this, what kind of value added utility would some 3rd party using a sidechain pegged to bitcoin bring? Would they have to keep some bitcoin as assets to deposit in that multi-sig wallet? Do they even have to directly use bitcoin but instead use assets and issue IOU's denominated in EUR or USD or whatever?

Hi Austin; here you are replying to burred comments on reddit lol.
I understand the benefits of what smart contracts and such can bring: you simply have a token of value on the network that represents something else in the real world. I get that. 1 satoshi can represent the deed to a house, the transaction record of a bank transfer, etc, etc. What I was trying to figure out is through these sidechains; what are the requirements for holding bitcoin (E.G how much demand for bitcoin ITSELF would systems like these create?). I understand the value of the token is irrelevant because that particular one would represent something else in systems like these.
Also, said that:


While this is true, you still need the underlying hashing power of the bitcoin network for the sidechain to work. Am I correct? You can't run a closed, non mining sidechain like this without some basis in the actual bitcoin blockchain? 
I'm trying to get my head around this and the specifics, thanks for your time and answers. Cheers

Sorry, but no. As I originally said, wave counts are entirely subjective. Different people have different opinions on what is isn't a 5 wave. What is or isn't a flat.

The only problem with that is socialized losses. It's not a huge problem because they typically are pretty small anyway, but it still can impact your hedge anyway.

I have heard this figure too. Many of their expenses are capex expenses. These guys may not ever make ROI on some of their miners, but as long as electricity costs are still less than the daily return... Those miners will still stay running.

I know this is a different way of handling this problem compared to other exchanges who rate-limit orders if it exceeds a certain rate to allow the books to recover, but you have not limited the orderbook visibility on your .com futures platform? I can look and see a considerable distance into the book, much more than you can see on the .cn spot price. And considering the inherit volatility of futures and the risk held by all who trade there shouldn't there be some sort of system (not saying which one!) to help prevent that?

I'd actually disagree. His responses are actually based on real problems, and while they may not be as major as he thinks, I think they are all valid concerns. 


Venmo and Squarecash basically front you the money and "fake" it being fast, but real settlement actually says day(s). Even SEPA in Europe takes a day. Mostly untrue. 


This varies a lot. Most of the pain in the ass is around a) KYC with exchanges and b) setting up a wallet. Writing down the recovery seeds. etc. True cold storage is $100 for a ledger, or rather difficult and complex to set it up yourself.


Yes. 


Yes. Binance just got hacked for 7k btc within the last week. Individuals still get tricked all the time. 


The primary use case is still speculation. That is &gt;95% of the economy\market cap. How many people ACTUALLY use it as their primary currency for day-to-day transactions? 


It's overall trend is up as a store of value, but yes there are some gnarly bubble cycles. I think this question can only be answered with the test of time - how well does it hedge against fiat currencies and their inflation rates once the "bubble era" of crypto is over.


Yep. Price * inflation + velocity of money (fees) = energy consumption. Eventually for bitcoin, the slowing inflation will lower this significantly, but if crypto were used to handle all global transactions, it would be a significant percentage of humanities energy budget. It remains to be seen if solutions like POS can mitigate this. Ethereum I think will be the first one to truly test this at full-scale, as other coins are POS but are rather minor in the scheme of things.


Remains to be seen. Other implementations of bitcoin using other backend systems have their own pro's and con's.

It's normal for markets in periods of low volume. There sure was a lot of buying when we were on the runup to 315. 
The "low" volume was because it was a period of consolidation. The market was preparing for a big move so nobody was really trading... until everyone jumped at the gun.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:34:49


Well yes it does have more information, there is information on a log scale chart that simply is not present on linear scaling. The 2011 bubble is about two pixels high and looks like a flat line. When in reality the price went from 10 cents to $32, which is a 300x gain. And then again from $2 to $266, which is like 130x. Neither of which are visible, so by that fact alone I'd argue that linear scaling contains less information for the bitcoin chart.


Log scaling answers the "doubling" question much easier. Every time you double, you have to look up twice as high when viewed from a linear scale. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. Each number gets twice as far from the next. With log scaling, it puts these all equa-distant from each other.

I totally understand being used to something. Bitcoin is a... crazy case because very very very few stocks or things in the traditional indices market have such insane ranges on their charts. The all time history goes from 10 cents to $20,000. Most stocks don't do that because they IPO far later in their lives and in bitcoins case, would have IPO'd at $10 or something. Thats two orders of magnitude difference. 
If you look through my comments, many of which are to other people, you'll see me explain this a bit further. I feel pretty passionately about this to be honest, and I've been having this argument for about 4 or 5 years. I've, uhh, refined my viewpoint. I try really hard and not say you're wrong, I just try my best to point out the facts and present the most clear argument - hence the comment you replied to here. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:47:56


Kinda funny because the smaller the price delta, the closer to linear scaling that log scale works. On short timeframes where you have a couple % range, they are functionally identical. In my eye log scale maintains the proportion while linear scaling gets more and more distorted the further you zoom out and increase the range the chart is showing.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:21:35
Just by the fact that at small ranges, linear and log present exactly the same. Only once you increase the range does linear distort more and more while log stays usable. 
I'd have no idea of the megabubble in 2011 if there weren't log charts.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:27:52
copypasta from a comment below:
ETH went from $120 to $80, no big deal right? It's tiny on the linear chart. No, it's actually massive, that's a move that lost it a third of it's value. Proportionally it's the same as a move from $1400 to $950. Both are -33%. That's what log scaling tries to prevent against, it keeps the proportion of these kinds of moves the same across different prices so that you always have an apples to apples comparison.

100% agree, every bubble has been half as big and the time between has been growing. And the slope of each bubble has been shallower. So yep, growth is slowly slowing as the market saturated.

Basically zero, it may as well be a rounding error. Those high-end luxury items are never driven. It's rare to see ferrari's with more than 10,000 miles, 20,000 would be considered high mileage. The only ones that do more than that are in exotic rental fleets. Their emissions are so minuscule that it's irrelevant. 


Much better. I don't have a good answer for this to be honest. The actual money printing doesn't matter much, but the economic cost of banks, their servers, brick and mortar stores, etc, etc.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:45:45
Actually it took half that. From the bottom, bitcoin took 18 months to recover to the median (650), and two years to retest the ATH. 
My point is that both of the bear trends have been (so far) similar in proportion and drawdown. You can't even see the previous one when looking at linear scaling.

I've said this a few times, but I think this is a pretty big thing. Peak load vs. nighttime load. Without getting info disclosed from a real miner on how that's handled though, I think it's a opaque road to go down.

@_date: 2018-12-19 00:58:44


Not necessarily. Linear charts make it seem like there is a... bigger runup than there really is. To me they look super skewed. 
Also, linear is the "Default setting" on most charting apps. Coinbase only allows linear. It isn't until people become more experienced do they use log. And that takes time.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:25:06
I said specifically which chart you with more information about the price history. My problem with linear charts is that when you start getting such wide moves, the chart becomes distorted and what looks like a small move is actually massive. 
ETH went from $120 to $80, no big deal right? It's tiny on the linear chart. No, it's actually massive, that's a move that lost it a third of it's value. Proportionally it's the same as a move from $1400 to $950. Both are -33%. That's what log scaling tries to prevent against, it keeps the proportion of these kinds of moves the same across different prices so that you always have an apples to apples comparison.
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:48:01
The only time you ever find me using the first linear chart is in this type of comparison. I use nothing but log.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:41:54


It's kind of funny because at low volatility levels, linear and log scaling are identical. Zoom into the 1 minute and turn on\off log scale. The chart barely changes.
IMO, linear is the one becoming distorted the more you increase the range (aka zoom out).
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:32:55
That's what's on offer right now... people add more offers as price moves up. People hit the bid. etc.

Bitcoin did, not all, but quite similar sketchy shit... 2013 was a different era
* Silk road one of the biggest bitcoin "companies" out there
* Has few use cases aside from buying drugs and gambling; merchant adoption was slow until late late late
* Mining scams just starting w\ butterfly labs
* mtgox pumping the prices with fake money before imploding loosing like 7% of the totaly supply and probably closer to 10% of the actually circulating supply. That's bigger than the DAO was for ETH. 
So don't discount Ethereum just yet. Ethereum ICO's are our generations dot com bubble which 20 years ago still spawned some great companies despite 95% of them eventually failing. ICO's will have a similar track record I imagine, but still. The space has yet to mature and go through natural bear market washout of the weakness to make the system stronger.

The thing is that your estimate has to be right only a slight majority of the time. People have this misconception that TA is 100% accurate and the times it's wrong means whoever did it is a bumbling idiot. You only have to be right enough times to come out in profit in the long run. You use TA to make plausible outcomes and trade accordingly. If you have skill at it you will profit in the long run because you make the right judgement calls and see the right patterns enough to beat the crowd. 
Experience + TA = conviction like I was spouting in this thread.

Owning bitcoin sure is entitiling you to owning something associated to bitcoin... because you own bitcoin. The main problem you're trying to say is that you don't have any "use" for bitcoin right now like you have a use for a stock (voting rights &amp; profit sharing). But how many people who own stocks really spend alot of their time micro-managing and voting on every last item for that company?
But you're right, until there is a mainstream adoption of the currency (e.g a large company endorses it), it's little more than speculation currently. But there sure are a hell of alot of people who use stocks for speculation and investing, and the same can &amp; will be said for bitcoin. Hell, there is a small chance that in time down the road it will even be considered a store of **wealth** like gold &amp; silver that is independent of fiat dollar devaluation from inflation.

The market drop today was 1% from the loss of bitcoin and 99% speculation that the price would drop and people were trying to get in before it happened, causing it to happen quicker and harder.
I believe BTC price is still vastly determined by speculation at this point (except when whale buy\sells hit). It hit especially hard recently because the overall news for BTC has been relativity quiet in the recent weeks with no major movements or announcements, so when something major did happen people reacted quickly and sharply.
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:03:43
What is the benifit of owning dollars compared to euro's? It depends on your marketplace, and what you're using them for. Each will, in time, offer advantages over the other. Litecoin is scrypt based, so no massive ASIC farms, it has 1\4th of the confirmation time (blocks are mined every 2.5 minutes instead of 10). The latter is the biggest thing, while Bitcoin may be a store of value and long-term investment, Litecoin may be a feature for every-day transactions because of the speed at which it operates.

I can gaurentee that the majority of "lost coins" are in the 50BTC wallets. coins that haven't moved since they were created, in 50BTC amounts, will probably be referred to as lost coins sometime in the future. Those wallets will be probably added to get a rough estimate of exactly how many BTC were lost in the turmoil. The thing is, this will probably be an ever decreasing number because there will never be an end of wallets finally being cashed in. Some people have probably put some wallets away for decades in some cases.

The theoretical equilibrium is where transaction fees + block rewards = the efficiency of the chips (electricity they use) and the cost of design &amp; production. 
There is no way to predict that number, since every factor will always be changing. But the market will find that point pretty easily. Right now- were severely under it, considering ASIC chips are growing STUPIDLY fast. I estimate in 8-12 months it will slow down however, once the top-end production of chips reaches the current level of Intel &amp; other such processors and they will continue to follow the 18-month doubling rule all electronics follow.

Half their savings? Aside from the whales who (I would hope) have much much larger asset portfolios, I would imagine a good deal of people would throw a percent or two of their holdings into BTC. Not enough to make a dent if things went south, but enough to see the market and make a healthy return if it does end up taking off.
50% is a very large number I don't think very many people at all did.

No I didn't, but I also didn't look either. Do you have an idea of what day they were started? You potentially could look for spikes in bitcoin days destroyed around the same time which would lead a similar conclusion to what we're seeing today.
EDIT: The trust launched in late September, right in the middle of a period of almost zero activity for Bitcoin days destroyed. The only spike notable was 32million days destroyed at the beginning of August, but the time between the two events is too far off for me to be as sure as I am with this post. Interesting nonetheless.

Your graph only shows this current bubble up to the first time peak of $900. I think this current bubble has more to go in it, considering the buy-ins we see every time it pops. When we trenched down to the 400-500 range, the downward trend just got stopped in it's tracks.

If you are able to front thousands of dollars for a ASIC mining unit, then I don't think you're in a position where you're relying on it to pay for the electricity bill. They also realize that, unless they wait for the market to rise, they won't be making a ROI anytime soon, so it's best to hold onto the coins (or at least a good chunk of them) for the long-run to see if they can make some bigger returns.
At least that's what I would do.
@_date: 2013-12-31 22:56:34
If you have this kind of influx of money into the market and the largest Bitcoin ETF being formed, with purchasing of Bitcoins at what appears to be far above market value OFF of the exchanges... Yes, I was insinuating that things potentially could be looking up if this all indeed is true.
It would help explain the unexplainable markets and the random buy-ins we've been seeing. Overall the exchanges are just holding their breath right now, no volume or anything. A investment firm acquiring enough Bitcoins to start a fund would cause a rally like we've never seen before, hence why I believe it happened off the exchanges. They contacted a miner who had coins from the beginning of Bitcoin and bought them in a private sale. Add to that this all happens on days before 2013 ends.
I might be wrong, but a storm may be brewing.

This defeats the entire point of Bitcoin in the first place, so why would they implement something like this? The whole point is to send the coins to the person and have them under their own control, as if you send them money (you did!).

Bitcoin didn't crash like people thought it would from Silk Road closure, the looming US Economic default, and recent activity from China in the terms of the company endorsement &amp; news about their economic activity.

You're all getting too caught up in the numbers game instead of understanding the concept behind it. The version number doesn't necessarily imply that it is in beta stage, the fact that the client &amp; protocol still ARE in beta stage is the main piece of information. The utility will continue to grow as more and more features are added and bugs are fixed, from escrow and multi-party signatures to colored coins (I have mixed feelings about those); the idea of Bitcoin and the completely public blockchain have far unforseen utility and innovation in the road ahead.
We're still in the mid-90's in the terms of email &amp; the internet, and very early 2000's in terms of texting. And look at where we are today and the companies that have been built up around those simple PROTOCOLS. All bitcoin is doing is putting a price on the protocol.
I believe that people should be considering Bitcoin's use as a currency to potentially be a secondary, lessor effect to what it truly is capable of.

The risk associated is part of the game however, that's how this world works. We drive cars because it's extremely convenient 99% of the time we need them, but we take on the associated risk of crashing a metal box at 60mph and potentially killing us. Sure there are safety systems, but they can't 100% mitigate you driving head on into another car.
Bitcoin is built the same way. You can use QR codes to scan bitcoin addresses and use escrow system to mitigate trust, but you have to understand the way the system works there is no way to reverse the transaction of money. It's the core fundamental theory that governs how the entire currency works. It's the next most efficient way of managing money on a global scale. What else works? The massive banking system we have now that is, effectively, run by people, and Bitcoin has just digitied it.

Yes they are. In our economy actual cash money and "credit" are both means of purchasing goods. Your credit cards just allow the payment of the goods and services to be pushed back days, months, weeks, years allowing for faster short term growth based on debt.
Let me make an analogy.
You accept credit cards as a means of payment. The person on your website makes a purchase and buys something with a credit card, however, you don't actually get that persons money. They don't transfer funds from their bank account to yours, so you're not accepting that persons cash. You get the cash from the credit card company. The same thing happens with Bitcoin transactions transferred through companies like Bitpay. You don't get the actual Bitcoins, you get Bitpay's cash when they take the Bitcoins from the customer, the only difference is that there is not debt system like credit cards.

I too saw that in the CNN article. The event starts in 2 hours so we're not far away from knowing.

Why...not? It's the biggest of the alt-coins. Bitcoin is so entrenched it will certainly be around, but I have a few invested in litecoin on the off-chance it takes off.

I agree, I believe 0.01 is the lowest I've seen any exchange go. But you can send much smaller amounts on the bitcoin network if you so choose, though sending pennies usually isn't worth it because of the transaction fee associated with that (mainly to prevent spamming). The 8 decimal places are intended to be used so you can transact exact amounts (e.g .82030415BTC @ 364.95USD = 300.0000 USD).

email wasn't easy to use back in 1995. Making sure POP3 was configured properly, making sure there wasn't a 350kb attachment which would possibly crash your client or the server. You couldn't buy anything on the internet, people were afraid of buying things online because there was no credit card security. 
Now look at where we are today. And Bitcoin is going to be bigger than email, it has so many other properties that are each on their own more valuable than what email has provided.

3600 BTC\day is being created yes, but however not anywhere close to all of that is being sold onto the markets. Many miners are simply holding out for higher prices in the future. It simply isn't profitable to sell the coins right now, but if you want 6 months for the price to rise 200-300%, then the returns on your investment suddenly appear.
tl;dr I believe many miners simply hold onto the coins they mine and are waiting for higher prices.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:08:52

Yet I've seen people say fuck those plans, I'll make the market rise 10% with my buy order... I've watched a 2500 coin buy-in take it from $900 to $980 as fast as the trading engine could execute the trades. Insane. It stabilized at $915 for a decent amount of time afterward too.
2013-12-09 1:00 is when it happened on mtgox.
@_date: 2013-10-22 23:29:08
I agree. We're in the middle of the so-called ASIC bubble, where people bought pre-orders on investments without realizing how little returns they really will offer. I still believe these companies will still keep advancing the tech, though the rate of progress will certainly start slowing down once most of them get on the 28\20nm process. I don't see them outstripping &amp; minimizing further than what most major CPU\GPU manufacturers are doing with budgets that are 1,000x higher.
I say May 24th, 2016. Also if you donate 1 BTC now... Who knows how much that could be worth 3 years from now. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 22:30:26
If this somehow manages to take off... It will be a truly great moment for this community and BTC as a whole.

It's the ease of entering the market that will drive up the market cap and bring more of an influx of money. More and more exchanges are opening, more companies are offering services allowing people to get money INTO bitcoin from fiat. Early adopters are buying in hoping the system will, in time, develop to the services they need and are instead investing in the generation of a new industry. We're all the "investors" in creating the new network, and our payoff is a larger stake when business starts running in the future.
A bit off topic, but no I don't think so. There are alot of other countries (mainly China) that are still making huge gains at adding capital to the bitcoin market.

However, even as we're seeing today, the rates of every one of those inputs is changing. G\hash per watt is gaining, the price per btc is going up, both of which raise the ceiling ever higher.

Holly crap that's a hell of a wait. It's what I've been saying for a while, mining has not been profitable for the majority of this year because of the wait times often seen with ASIC chips. You will never recover the bitcoins you potentially could have bought with that money. Someone HAS to pay for the development costs of those chips, and it's always going to be the consumer.
@_date: 2013-11-02 02:31:32

That was one of the better articles I've ever read on Bitcoin. It had a particularly good explanation of the events of the last few weeks.
@_date: 2013-11-01 11:03:06
Bitcoin may be in beta, but aside from extremely Conservative contributes who require an almost unanimous consent to make decisions, it can &amp; will evolve and have other sections added to it for additional uses.
There are many extra built-in functions for Bitcoin that haven't been "activated\written" yet, but exist as ideas that could be implemented if needed.
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:11:32
Let me put it this way, if there were an event to cause the worlds telecommunication networks (internet) AND electricity grids to fail to the point where the Bitcoin network could not operate, whether or not we can still send Bitcoins would be the least of our worries.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:48:28
I'm pissed, BTC-e went offline for the first times ever, I havne't been able to place any orders for the last 15 minutes since this all started and I wanted to buy in.
This sucks.
@_date: 2013-11-10 11:13:14
Paper wallets are so easy to use though... As long as you have bitcoins setup, the actual use of them is blindingly easy, you only need to have two codes and a blockchain.info account to use them. Send bitcoins to the address to store them, then use blockchain.info to import the private key and use that to spend the BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:38:22
It's not the bitcoin wallet, it's called the Bitcoin blockchain. Also, yes there is a method that has been in the books called blockchain pruning which removes transactions for coins that have been spent more than once (e.g it only records the most recent place that particular coin has been). But it isn't necessary (yet) because you don't have to be running a full node to use Bitcoin, and the size of the blockchain is (relatively) small.

I thought it would be Newegg, Subway, or Starbucks since they're been involved in the past with accepting BTC. This is new and exciting. June\July seems like such a far way away, but the potential floodgates that will be opened with a move like this are monumental. 
Once one person steps forward, the rest follow.
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:06:43
Oh I see. I'm not sure then, there might be other things going on behind the scenes but it seems like that's just how the person programmed it. 
Make em change it! But if that tipper ever starts becoming pretty popular that's a awful big security risk IMO. There must be some intrinsically safer way that the person is doing it. I just don't know enough to even fathom what it could be.
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:19:36
There should be an option built into the QT client to be able to easily move the save location of the blockchain for this exact reason. SSD's are becoming more and more popular and there needs to be an easy way to mitigate the ever-growing size of the blockchain. Eventually it will become too large for the average person to just install on their computer, which will be a major problem in a few years once it reaches that point.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:29:01

@_date: 2013-11-15 22:13:22
Not to mention litecoin mining among others. It's too late for BTC, but not the other currencies. 
It might even happen that bitcoin mining will be integrated into main chips (think intel, AMD) using very low amounts of power. They use idle power to mine. Sure, it won't make you rich, but it distributes the computing power to the masses and gives them a little penny for doing nothing. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 05:39:18
Everyone is jumping to provide loopholes in the rulings from the government. Things are going to be a mess until there is a concrete regulation provision created by the US &amp; Chinese governments. If\when a major agency from each announces any form of regulation (even if it's fairly strict) we will see a gigantic rally as players heavily invested in the future of the field start panic-buying as the flood gates open.
Regulation &amp; business adoption is the next step, the beginnings of which are forming now. They will cause the next bubble, just as China caused the last one. And it will come sooner than most people expect. 
Prepare people, 2014 is going to be the year of the Bitcoin.

I've done the same thing... I have bitcoin widgets for all 3 major exchanges on my phone (and litecoin!), along with holdings in both BTC and LTC. I'm in it for the long haul however, not to make a quick buck with some trading (though I do fool around with .1BTC trading every now and then). 
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:13:48
Yeah but it's less than 30 years until we reach 20,917,968BTC; 99.80%. So the VAST majority are going to be mined pretty soon.

Complaining about a single downvote...? Come on man.
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:40:47
Less than the 40-50% in previous weeks. I've been guessing the hashrate will be between 8-10PH\sec by years end, as I've been saying for months while other people were only saying ~5. It seems to be slowing, but there are alot of companies that have dec rollouts for their new units, so I think around mid\late december we're going to see another surge that will shove us into the region I'm expecting.  
Why won't the mining bubble burst? SOMEONE will still be using all those ASICS. They're not going to be idle, they just eventually will work their way to people with very low cost electricity.

I have to agree with you. You can't design and\or run one of the most secure TOR sites on the internet and then fuck up by posting with your gmail account linked to your real name. You never even use those profiles on the computers you use to manage the SR with.

And in that time we've touched 2300 and are currently on our way through 2500 after being at 2630 half an hour ago.

Could this possibly be part of the hardware updates they need to do before launching their new trading engine &amp; possibly litecoin? Still all purely speculation, but we can only hope.
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:39:27
It's also part of the (exponential) growth, it's not going to be a smooth ride to the top. It also seems like the market relies heavily on news sources as an indicator of price instead of typical earnings reports &amp; other factors that you typically see in normal stocks. That's why most traditional stock indicators and analysis don't apply to well, the entire trend can be changed by one mis-informed whale who decides to dump (or pump) the market 5% in a minute.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:06:54

4k? You're shooting low my friend. The innovation that has been provided by this INVENTION of the blockchain will provide far greater wealth in the future just based on it's utility alone.
Sure I'm just some random on the internet, but realize that we are still in the early Beta stage of this technology development. The future, short of a major government on a scale far larger than what we've seen for China, is looking brighter than our own star.
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:20:53
They have their prices set so they win either way. If they don't sell enough, they still make money by having hashing power that's chucking away. If they sell some, they sold it for more than what it technically could produce. Win-win for them. And it seems like it. They're selling a highly depreciating asset (hashing power) for a 1 year lease at a fixed cost. There is a reason it's a 1 year plan and not weekly or monthly...
But holly shit those prices are insanely high. $12,000 for 200GH\s? The network would have to have ZERO growth for you to hit ROI in a year. Their stage 2 rollout would require a net network growth of 8% to even meet your ROI, and that's presuming they meet the Jan rollout date.

Litecoin has had much more of a history, and at least Mtgox has been hinting of adding it. Though I have a feeling they might go the route like BTCe and add a range of crypto's. They do need to diversify their market portfolio, but I think that's what they're building their new trading engine Midas for.

It's far far easier to simply steal coins by stealing the password for the account by social engineering or some other phishing\hacking method than it is to break the underlying network. Who knows though, when the value goes up it will make more people incentiveize to find or create backdoors into the protocol.
As of now though, there are no known exploits in the protocol. The only real "danger" is a 51% attack to cause a blockchain fork.
@_date: 2013-11-01 01:05:20
More volume figures here:
But you're right, they do have a very large market share now that's based on... 0% fees. I don't see them continuing it for too long though, just enough to get them as the dominant exchange in China. However, of other Chinese exchanges have 0%, so will they.
@_date: 2013-10-17 20:09:14
This is a very real point to make, as the network hashrate is skyrocketing currently which is putting alot of miners into a reality check about the value and ROI of their investments. However, someone has to pay for the investments into R&amp;D to design and build these super-powerful chips that are **required** for the BTC network in it's future years down the road. A small price to pay IMO.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:30:48
If you bought in during the last bubble or at $150, cash out your initial investment, but keep the rest.
