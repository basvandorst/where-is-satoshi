Its a craze. Everyone and their dog is at it. Which is why the gov. clamp down is no surprise.
The problem with this country is popular trends spread like wild fire and consume the entire country. This can be both good and bad. Remember the cult ex-pres?
After the gov. 'ban' news, which hit yesterday and spread through even through kakaotalk, people are divided. Id say half are in the sell camp, half are HODL.

This only works up to $50k a year. The reason arbitrage works is because btc is more expensive in korean won, but theres an annual transfer limit of USD 50,000 imposed by the gov. So you can buy cheap with USD then sell high in KRW, but theirs no way to cycle it back to USD past 50k.

Yes. Well you could by alt-coins with the KRW, but then that wouldn't be much of an arbitrage since the profit only comes when you convert KRW back to USD. Thus, you need a bank to cash out in fiat.

Exchange alone you probably can, but to cash out in KRW or to exchange to USD, youll need a korean bank account as well.

Well, the [real ban]( was on trading btc futures. So we won't be betting on btc prices like the states will on the 10th and 15th.
The [other 'ban']( is on buying and selling bitcoins. This is still an ongoing debate and there are talks that it might be outright banned, but in all likelihood it will be regulated by placing limits on age, amount, etc. and making it difficult for people to enter the market.

Have you tried backtesting the forecasts? I would be interested to see previous forecasts
