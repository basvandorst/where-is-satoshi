So you're saying that allowing subdivisions of satoshi are not linked in any way with scarcity but just with the overall value of a bitcoin?
Are we (or rather, am I) talking at cross purposes since the beginning?
@_date: 2019-07-08 11:40:42
Once the number is set, it's a point of reference. If this number increases, don't you think the price will be adjusted? I'm not an expert on this, I'm trying to understand, but to me it feels like dividing a scarce resource into smaller piece effectively increases the minimum amount anyone can get, so the supply increases in a way.
Also we will reach the technical limitations of computers eventually if we keep adding more zeros.

Hello ! Thank you for your response.
I'm unfortunately not able to suggest an implementation as I don't know enough about the implementation of Bitcoin Core. I only explored a few source files but not the whole thing. I don't have enough time to make all the research you mentioned. However I will try to have the most complete proposal as possible. Is there any optimal way to find if my idea have already been suggested other than reading the whole BIP repository (also given the fact that some BIP never made their way to the repository) ?
Because I don't have all the knowledge those people have, I'd like to think about it with them to see if it's a stupid or unreasonable idea so I will probably head to the Slack channel and ask there. Maybe make a reddit post as well.

If I ever lose coins, I would prefer them to be re-injected into the network rather than useless forever.
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:44:07
So you're saying it's only because of the dip? Interesting!
@_date: 2019-07-16 07:18:09
I was just checking this out of curiosity, I'm not worrying. I like keeping track of this kind data, it's interesting to see how the network behaves.
@_date: 2019-07-08 11:44:09
How wouldn't it require a hard fork? Wouldn't validator nodes deny inputs/outputs with less than 10e-8 BTC?
@_date: 2019-07-08 11:54:12
I think I didn't express myself correctly there.
Because adding more zeros would be a result of not having enough available coins anymore, I was wondering if the aim was to adjust what's available to use in order to keep the price the same. But that would assume that the price of everything else is based on bitcoin's price, which is wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:32:37
I was thinking about an expiration time of about a lifetime (100 years) to avoid this. Your point is absolutely valid and I'm taking it into consideration.
@_date: 2019-07-08 12:38:59
Well I can't prove you I don't have an ulterior motive. But I sure hope I don't give this feeling.
@_date: 2019-07-28 19:21:35
It's a problem because these people didn't pay taxes on their gains? Or is it something else? I understand it's pretty bad for privacy but they signed up for that by using coinbase, it's in their terms.
@_date: 2019-07-08 10:41:21
Please enlighten me. Why is it wrong?
@_date: 2019-07-28 19:18:21
Out of the loop. Can somebody explain to me what is this letter, why coinbase specifically, etc?
@_date: 2019-07-08 10:43:46
You've got a point, can you elaborate?
@_date: 2019-07-08 16:06:32
Because there is no point debating with someone who is already upset.
If say you're not, then let's go!
Your point is that we would be losing flexibility and control on our money, which is true. However, you can't deny that Bitcoin has its problems and a reluctant attitude is never going to help solving them. This is an on-going development, and we are still in the very early phases. Bitcoin as you seem to see it is an utopia, and we will have to compromise one day or another. In fact we already did in the past.
@_date: 2019-07-08 11:39:58
No I'm not assuming anything. I discussed this point in the preamble.
@_date: 2019-07-07 20:34:22
I'm going to write a full post tomorrow. But in short, it's a solution for lost bitcoins and to avoid too much scarcity if we keep losing more, by invalidating very old unspent utxos and allowing them to be re-emitted as mining rewards.
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:32:02
I feel you. Money is an enabler to me, not an end in itself. I feel bad having spare money, it's wasted potential in my eyes. I could use it to make great things, trying to make the world better. There's no point in having more than you need to live comfortably.
@_date: 2019-07-08 10:40:18
Even with a 200 years life time in the future, you would need to give a heartbeat only once or twice in your life. It's not that impractical. Such a radical life time change is very unlikely too.
It seems like you're ignoring most of my arguments just because you want to disagree. Can we have a constructive debate?
@_date: 2019-07-08 10:29:22
You obviously didn't read the whole post.
@_date: 2019-07-08 14:31:43
Why are you sounding so upset? This won't give your arguments more value than they already have.
As I said in the post, this is meant to be a discussion. I am not trying to enforce this proposal nor saying absolute truth. I was looking for feedback. Now, can we have a civil debate without all the emotions getting in the way?
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:38:18
Unpopular opinion: Bitcoin was also created from thin air in the beginning. It's just that the system doesn't make more spawn from nowhere because one powerful guy wanted to.
It has value because we all agree on this statement. Cryptocurrencies highlighted the fact that multiple currencies can coexists and reminded everyone what is the definition of a currency.
Altcoins don't have value to your eyes, but they have for some people.
@_date: 2019-07-08 10:55:14
I'm happily receiving some "no" if they contain good points and arguments. It's something I tried to explain in the preamble.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:30:05
I think they are right to some extent about the theft. It can absolutely be the case if the solution is not balanced enough. I want to be able to discuss it and make sure we can find a good balance so it doesn't feel so, otherwise my idea is worthless.
@_date: 2019-07-07 20:20:59
You're right. I don't really care about this kind of comments. All I want to do I try to contribute and give a bright future to Bitcoin. If people don't like the idea, so be it.
@_date: 2019-07-08 11:39:13
If it's accepted in the first place, that means that there have been consensus for 100 years. What is telling you that there would be consensus for 80 years after that?
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:28:29
I think that you shouldn't mix "*created out of thin air*" and "*has value*". The first doesn't imply it can't have value. Traditional cash is *created out of thin air*, but it still has value (for now at least), even if it's not intrinsic.
Bitcoins are indeed created in a limited amount, with predefined software rules, but it's still a "thing" that we created. Bitcoins are however created by using real-world resources (hardware and electricity), this is where the intrinsic value comes from.
Don't get me wrong, I share your opinion, I just wanted to express this slight nuance.
@_date: 2019-07-08 12:10:30
Ok, interesting. I edited the post accordingly, thanks!
@_date: 2019-07-08 10:45:16
Please read the whole post.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:04:35
We'll have to see how it goes, but I think that miners won't get enough rewards by the network fees only and that too much scarcity would lead to impracticability. I thought that re-emitting these coins would solve two problems at once. I don't read many strong arguments against it in the posts from your google search. Actually I also see many people thinking it would be a good thing.
I will still write my post tomorrow by exposing my arguments and see how it goes.
@_date: 2019-07-08 12:06:59
I understand the analogy.
I try to think long-term. Of course we'll be dead, but it doesn't prevent us from trying to avoid problems for our children. Altruistic thinking is hard apparently.
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:52:06
I'm not saying it's not working, I'm just thinking about the future when there would be many more transactions at once. Long confirmations / high fees are not desirable features from an outsider point of view.

@_date: 2019-07-08 12:18:27
This is a very good point.
Distributing fairly would require an entirely different change to the consensus than just allowing old UTXOs to be used without signature.
I have another proposal in mind: what if old UTXOs are still invalidated, but instead of being sent entirely to miners, their value would be added to a global counter of available coins. The re-issued coins would then be distributed the same way than coinbases: a fixed amount for every block.
@_date: 2019-07-08 11:36:36
It is indeed arbitrary. But once the number is set, it's a point of reference. If this number increases, don't you think the price will be adjusted? I'm not an expert on this, I'm trying to understand, but to me it feels like dividing a scarce resource into smaller piece effectively increases the minimum amount anyone can get, so the supply increases in a way.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:23:18
No, I want to contribute to the thinking process but I don't have the necessary skills to implement it. But you're one step too far. I want to discuss the idea before even thinking about implementing it.
Don't pretend you have to know 100% of how Bitcoin Core works in order to try to think about a possible improvement, that's wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:51:31
I hope Lightning will be more widely used later because we can already see that the network can't handle what's currently happening.
But if this increase in tx count is because of the dip and people moving their coins outside of exchanges, then lightning can't do anything about it.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:37:57
It is arbitrary indeed. Because we don't have enough information to make statistics about this yet. I would happily be proved wrong though.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:27:07
The expiration would be very long. I was thinking about something along the lines of 100 years (about the time of a long human life) sitting there unspent. If they are unspent for this long, it would be because they are lost or that a deceased person didn't give the seed to their relatives.
I understand that it can look like robbery. It is a valid point. I'm trying to find a balance so &gt;99% (ideally 100%) of the re-emitted coins are actually lost coins.
@_date: 2019-03-24 11:20:03
Nice article, I'm definitely going to share it with all the people I know who don't understand why Bitcoin has value!
@_date: 2019-11-06 11:42:17
Any partial mnemonic can be very easily bruteforced to find the full one. This is not really a safe option.
@_date: 2019-11-06 11:44:55
Do you know if there is a way to schedule a transaction? By that I mean that instead of timelocking some BTC and not being able to use them at all, we could maybe think of a way of sending the money automatically in, let's say, 50 years.
Maybe I'm missing something or it's already what timelock is. If so, please tell me.
@_date: 2019-08-26 12:04:33
I was just asking if the hash rate is a relevant information to use in the yield calculation. Is higher always better or is it a bit more complicated?
Maybe some other metrics need to be crossed with it?
@_date: 2019-08-26 13:49:34
Thanks, that's what I wanted to know!
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:46:54
Can you please all stop looking for an hour so I can buy a little. :D

For those wondering, this box is [available on Vagrant]( Very neat!  
I will share it to trainers I know so they can use it for their courses.

Looks great! And it works perfectly on firefox.

I didn't know this old ad. Indeed it's much better and more on point. Grayscale is missing the point IMO. It's not about investing, it's about having an alternative for money. Their ad suggests that it's only a store of value but nothing else. (Although it's very subtly addressed in their website that you can actually buy things with BTC)
