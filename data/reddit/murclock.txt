Done.  I really think this would be the most effective way to bring bitcoin to the masses via Google.  Google's core strength is bringing the internet to average people with easy to use, easy to understand applications.  If a bitcoin wallet were built into gmail, millions of people would instantly have a wallet and a way to accept bitcoin from others.  
Also, imagine how easy it would be to explain bitcoin to people!  For those that aren't technically inclined, the explanation is as simple as bitcoin = digital cash you can attach to an email.

I think I can see where you're going with this but it would make more sense to tie purchasing power to a fixed bitcoin amount and not a wallet balance (the most obvious amount is 1 BTC). 
Then, instead of keeping a database, just use Amazon's API to show a handful of products that are about equal to the current exchange rate.

After thinking about it some more, the biggest problem I see with this arrangement is that it still requires a middleman between the customer and Incoin (whether it be Bluebird or any other type of customer bank account or loadable credit card).  It seems to me this isn't much different than setting up direct deposit to an acct linked to my Coinbase acct, then just setting up a recurring buy.  The real value would be in a service that eliminates the need for the customer to have an account in addition to their Incoin acct.  
I think it would be worthwhile to completely vet the feasibility of direct deposit from employer to Incoin.  
It's too bad you can't generate bank accounts as easily as bitcoin key pairs...

Exactly.  A few weeks ago I ran the idea by a friend of mine that works in HR at a big university.

This is crazy.  Bitcoin isn't a threat to Apple.  They should embrace it and the new technology it represents!  They can make a lot more money just using it rather than competing with it.
If they want to launch iMoney, then they should do it! They can launch it as a proof of stake coin, with 100% of the coins owned by them to start, then build an exchange where you can buy it with fiat money or bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.  They can promote using iMoney to pay for things in iTunes and the App Store.  They can accept bitcoin too and simply offer things at a discount if you use iMoney.
There will be so much liquidity in the cryptocurrency markets in the days, months, and years ahead that it will only help increase the value of their iMoney tokens.  They have all the infrastructure and resources to create the tools that can bring all cryptocurrencies main stream.
I just don't understand how all the smart people at Apple can't see the big picture here.

I'd love to know the answer to this too.  Thinking about it, it seems that it should be possible as long as most or all miners are merged mining each side chain involved.  This would provide the double spend protection necessary to ensure scarcity.  I imagine that code could be written in such a way to prevent movement between side chains and bitcoin if the side chain does not have the necessary hash rate to ensure security (maybe some fraction of the bitcoin total hash rate).  I'm still struggling to imagine how moving bitcoins between chains would work in practice.


I think this one's a little easier.  Inflation in the side chain could be facilitated by developing an algorithm that shifts the peg (exchange rate).  It would be akin to a stock split.  If I moved bitcoin in before the shift, my balance in side chain currency would simply increase by whatever the inflation rate is.  If I buy after the shift, I just get the new exchange rate.


I think it really depends on what goes majorly wrong.  Most alts are built on bitcoin source code so if there was a major bug in the code, it would likely effect everyone anyway.  I think in a world of side chains, if something were to happen to the main chain there's no reason the side chains couldn't just be mined on there own effectively reverting back to where we currently are.

I have a feeling many entrepreneurs in the bitcoin industry have run into these same issues although the climate seems to be getting better every day.  
One of the keys to making this work is a solid relationship with your bank.  Finding the right bank and working with them to understand your business is vital, as well as for you to understand exactly how they process incoming ACH deposits. 
I don't think the control aspect of adding another layer is really an issue here.  Through their employer, the customer controls where their pay is direct deposited and the expectation is that whatever they deposit with Incoin will be converted and sent back to them as bitcoin.  You're never holding the money longer than it takes to convert it to bitcoin.  The customer knows how much they should receive in USD because they get a pay stub that shows how much was sent to Incoin.
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:53:50
This could be made even easier if you simply received ACH deposits from the employer.  That way, the employer doesn't even need to sign up at all.  The employee could setup an account with incoin.io then simply fill out direct deposit paper work with their employer using Incoin's bank account information.

I don't see how this is practical without something like Lightning.  Why would I want to open a payment channel with each peer?  The advantage of bittorrent is that you can increase bandwidth by downloading from multiple peers, but that would just make the tx fees of so many payment channels prohibitively expensive.  Plus, once downloaded, now anyone can seed the file freely.  There is no value proposition.

@_date: 2015-10-21 23:59:45
Yeah, but my point is that lightning isn't even necessary.  The entire idea of Counterparty is to build an additional layer on top of bitcoin that simply relies on bitcoin's immutability and isn't constrained by bitcoin's limited scripting language.  There's no reason why a variation of the timelock mechanism utilized by the lightning network couldn't be implemented in Counterparty-lib.  The commitment transactions don't need to rely on utxos because Counterparty assets are not beholden to them.  Unfortunately, the Counterparty forums have pretty light traffic and even lighter from the core devs so I'm not that surprised you never got an answer.

From Wikipedia... "An intrinsic theory of value (also called theory of objective value) is any theory of value in economics which holds that the value of an object, good or service, is intrinsic or contained in the item itself. Most such theories look to the process of producing an item, and the costs involved in that process, as a measure of the item's intrinsic value."
I'm not saying that the electricity and time spent mining is what solely creates the value contained in bitcoins (although it certainly supports its classification as a commodity).  My argument is the value contained within the bitcoin is a function of all the inputs to the block chain.

The total hash rate is a major input to the value of cryptocurrencies.
Can you agree that a much lower hash rate would have a negative effect on the current exchange rate for bitcoin?  It lowers consumer trust in the block chain's ability to resist fraud (or a 51% attack).  This is a major reason why alt-coins have a much lower exchange rate than bitcoin.

To some extent yes, but the value would be so small it would be negligible.  As I mentioned before, the value of a block chain is a function of the network size among other factors.  There are many alt-coins that can be traded for bitcoin.  They have value albeit small.
Bitcoin is the most valuable cryptocoin because its block chain has the largest network and hash rate (it has the most participants).  I think we can both agree if people were to stop mining bitcoin the value would decrease.  That's the reason the bitcoin economy can exist.  People choose to exchange physical goods for bitcoin because bitcoin itself has value not just because a bunch of people one day just decided it did.

Banks have to maintain a reserve ratio, so they keep reserves at the Fed to lend to other banks so they can meet the required ratio.  How will banks needing to meet those ratios be able to if there are no reserves held at the Fed?  They'll have to pay a premium somewhere else.

“I do not understand where the backing of Bitcoin is coming from,” the former Fed chief said. “There is no fundamental issue of capabilities of repaying it in anything which is universally acceptable, which is either intrinsic value of the currency or the credit or trust of the individual who is issuing the money, whether it’s a government or an individual.”
Greenspan is solving his issue with bitcoin in this statement.  He just has a limited definition of trusted money issuer.  It should government, individual, or **the people**.
@_date: 2013-06-15 18:59:18
It's accepted as exchange for goods because it has value.  Just because the block chain is simply a list of transactions doesn't mean it doesn't contain value.  The method in which it is created and maintained by the network gives it value.  Most of this value is derived from trust (a function of network size and hash rate) and scarcity.  
I could argue that there is no unique task that gold is suited for, and it's simply a shiny yellow rock.  I wouldn't claim that the individual rocks in my yard have anything but a negligible intrinsic value.
Or how about electricity?  It's just charged electrons, it is not a physical good yet it is considered a commodity.
The ability to accept bitcoin in exchange for goods is not a unique feature for a commodity (i.e. gold and silver).  This feature gives it EXTRINSIC value because that portion of the bitcoins worth is affected by external factors.  For example, if I live in a community where every brick and mortar merchant accepts bitcoin then it has a much higher value to me as a currency than if I live in a location where no one accepts bitcoin for goods or services.  However, in both instances, I can go on an online exchange and trade one bitcoin for the same amount of fiat currency at any given time.
@_date: 2013-06-15 15:45:43
You would have to consider all inputs and assign weight to each one.  I also don't think the added value associated with each input is a linear function of the input.  For example, once a block chain reaches a certain size each incremental increase in size may not add as much value as those early increases.
@_date: 2013-06-15 05:38:55
If value derived from hashing algorithms is a commodity, then all block chains have a certain level of intrinsic value.  This value is benchmarked by the most widely accepted which for now is Bitcoin.  Remember the Chinese knockoff has value primarily because Gucci is desirable and has a high cost.  That's actually a great analogy.

Haha, I thought about it but decided to let the title speak for itself.  My general feeling is that, as with internet adoption, the rate of bitcoin adoption will be skewed toward younger generations,

Remove one of the most risk free methods for banks to generate revenue (by giving them a negative interest rate when they lend surplus reserves to other banks) and they'll have to re-invest that capital somewhere else.
I get it.
But you're assuming whatever they invest in will yield enough return they don't have to pass that cost to the depositer.  I think that is a bad assumption.

How can you have negative interest rates and NOT charge depositers?  The only way negative interest rates work is through coercion or a hell of a marketing campaign.  No one is going to keep their money in a bank if the bank is blatantly going to take it a little at a time (in the U.S. at least, after reading that this is apparently already happening in Europe).

Why would "we as a collective" decide that bitcoin has value if the block chain itself has no value?  
I think this is the main reason that alt-coins have any value on exchanges.  There's almost no actual market for anything but bitcoin and litecoin to some extent.  It's because there is value in the structure of the block chain and how it was generated that the cryptocoin itself has any exchange value.

So much relatable stuff in this list.  I seem to deal with a lot of status quo bias whenever I talk to someone new about bitcoin.

It is a store of value as much as it is a medium of exchange.  Social security is, in it's most basic form, a system of saving over a period of time so as to provide a nest egg for retirement.  Considering bitcoin is deflationary and the current social security system is projected to be insolvent by the time the younger generation retires, I argue that systematic saving in bitcoin now will provide the necessary future value that social security won't.

Trust is similar to a transaction in that it exists between parties.  The difference is that trust exists between parties both before and after a transaction and only changes in intensity.  With zero net trust, there can be no transaction.
