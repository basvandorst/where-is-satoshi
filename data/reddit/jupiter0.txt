I support all hackers because they create a demand for security. All systems need to be exploited to initiate growth, just as the ray of the sun exploits our genetic code to create skin as a defense from ultraviolet rays.
I have been hacked. It taught me a lesson. Hackers kill corruption (wikileaks FTW). They represent the 99%. It's a logical deduction thay we wouldn't be where we are without those brave few who have the curiosity and skill to exploit the systems we take for granted. In a reality where survival is for the fittest, people like u/rekcahxfb should be seen as a catalyst for the advancement of human technology. We should not put a man in prison because he is able to disarm his master. May the most intelligent man win, because evolution is a process of natural exploitation. 
I am not rich. I am not poor. I am just a man who thinks for himself. Shame on Bitfinex for being irresponsible. Cheers to the selfless teachers who would take money from a fool and redistribute it to the magician.
You are either a fool, or a magician. Choose your side carefully.

Marketing 101 mistake: Entrepreneur  chooses primitive food service business, attracts new customers with a cutting edge payment system. Everyone is curious and talking about awesome technology and your food in the same breath. The food truck is suddenly interesting to talk about. It becomes so successful that he cannot afford to explain his new cutting edge payment system. Stops accepting bitcoin.

Define "freedom of transaction". You think anyone is going to have a sense of respect in an lawless anarchistic economy? Regulators have Coinbase by the balls, and they have to play a cautious game. You might say Fuck Em. I say, they've got the best track record of any exchange thus far. Keep the train rollin.

Coinbase has way too much going on to deal with small fry like this and risk their entire company in the future of Bitcoin by selling to street corner drug dealers. we have snapchat and Craigslist and local bitcoins for that. When the burning light of regulation shines upon a new economy, a company like coinbase who is really becoming quite a heavy hitter, has to take huge precautions. soon enough I'm sure they will stop selling Bitcoin to  non accredited investors to save themselves from BS like this

Localbitcoins is under the MOST legal scrutiny right now. Im not sure if you've heard. They are also insanely overpriced. I dont need my BTC bought with the same feeling as a drug deal on a street corner from a guy who is going to get busted any second for money laundering. I demand things from people, not government. I dont trust government, no do I know how to communicate with them. Thats why we have Reddit. I appreciate your response thought. I am just astounded with the lack of professionalism (and the demand for it) in this fantastic world of crypto.

I scanned my license to verify identity and connected some social networks. But it could have been any license. May the truth be told. Most of my C and B rated borrowers disappeared with no hope of collecting my stolen BTC - but like I said, the site got their cut - so there is no business incentive for them to improve the corrupted borrowing and credit rating platform until people realize just how much of a scam it is.

I appreciate your rude inquiry.
I disagree with him based on the fact that he is obviously clueless:
EF: You don’t carry around bitcoin in pieces of paper, do you?
BU: Yes, you absolutely can.
EF: Ok, then you can do the same thing as with dollars, and if you carry around pieces of paper marked with bitcoin that’s no different than carrying around dollars.
BU: That’s correct, except that you can actually put a million dollars of bitcoin into one piece of paper.
EF: Who cares about a million dollars? Who is this valuable to? Drug dealers *laughs*.
BU: Bitcoin can be used as a store of value, and it has censorship resistance components.
EF: No, it’s a not a store of value. Unless it has some other value, the core value has to come from something. It comes from its use as a unit of account in transactions. If people decide they don’t want to take it in transactions it’s value is gone. I don’t get what people who defend the censorship resistance are talking about. I guess that for a drug dealer that has a lot more value. But otherwise, I don’t see the big value about that.
- Does he mean to imply the value of a dollar is a consistent store of value? If miners refuse to accept Bitcoin as payment for the Blockchain, then perhaps that is the fallacy he means to refer to. Its use comes from the value of the Blockchain. Bitcoin had value before merchant acceptance - which, I find it interesting that exponentially increased merchant adoption has had little effect on the price of Bitcoin. His lack of education on the subject is obvious and the sophomoric critiques that he presents as a joke are exactly that. A joke. The father of modern finance should see that his child is deformed, corrupted and dying by now.

Understood. Consumers do have the power. Elaborate on the sucking. I bought 2 T-shirts for cheap with a transaction that was almost instant between myself and the merchant, whereas Paypal takes more clicks and pulls money from my bank whenever they feel like it (2 weeks later) while charging the merchant a fee, which drives up the price of goods. And one cannot prefer something over another if they dont know any other options. "majority of consumers prefer" is kind of unscientific. The majority doesn't even know what a bitcoin is or how to get it, let alone have the initiative to find out for themselves.

This speech is rough. He almost gets me excited half-way through, but he lost his big opportunity by attempting to demean the intrinsic cultural value of gold with a half-baked opinion on its lack of "pretty". Sortly after the unconvincing history lesson about seashells and the historical absence of barter, he immediately loses momentum, disperses his train of thought and with a subtle and desperate tone of insecure apprehension, he proceeds to flush his boring half-thoughts down the toilet of my withering excitement. Sometimes, you need to read chemistry in order to better understand the LSD experience - otherwise your newfound metaphysical outlook of "infinite cosmic potential" might seem built on thin air. Sometimes, when speaking of the infinite potential of Bitcoin (relative to gold), you need to understand that the role of gold as a cultural and industrial icon that cannot be ignorantly cast aside because you think its not pretty, especially when you could instead focus on the significant potential for Bitcoin to become its own cultural icon. Value has just as much to do with human desire as it does functionality. Humans value scarcity only when something is either useful or beautiful. Bitcoin is useful to a point that we have only seen a glimpse of, and it is beautiful because it represents a new kind of financial freedom. You all know what I speak of - and it is the most important aspect of the system. Declaring a theoretical war on gold is just a pipe dream for simple minds - an intellectual vanity-war that will never be won.
Why argue for a against a gold standard when one it doesn't even exist? I say to the speaker - get off the computer and get some life experience, because you make us look like idiots.
--------------TL:DR - the first half of the speech is decent. The second half is painful and desperate. A focus on comparing Bitcoin to Gold is pointless. There are bigger fish to fry.﻿

Great idea. Create a BTC fund, Distribute your paper notes, which can be redeemed for BTC, just as gold could be redemmed for dollars. Its new, hip, great for people who are  non-technical and attached to the commonly referred to concept concept of "real money", which means something they can hold in their hands. 
One way to adapt to the price fluctuation of BTC and consider agreeing to a 3 month or yearly price average to lock in a long-term, stable value for the community to use.
You may be surprised at how something like this could make a community come together to try something new. New things are usually fun. Especially if they have the potential to free us from our enslavers. Money should never be backed by debt.

Aside from the obvious reason to enjoy the concept of Bitcoin, I really love it for the sake of its newness - because I'd rather give money straight to Satan himself than engage in the slave-driven cycle of hyper-inflationary currency that will provide nothing for my future generations. I have yet to dream of or find a more viable option at the moment, and with its decentralized nature, Bitcoin encourages community effort and contrary to popular belief, I think that it will enable a more transparent system of financial accountability, which in the wake of the recent worldwide banking disasters, is a central theme to creating a more more civilized world. Devil's advocates never did me much good anyway. Im a naturally skeptical person who isn't afraid to get fanatical about cool shit like Bitcoin. We all appreciate your sarcasm though. Humor has no shortage here - because how else do we cope with the roller coaster motion sickness of riding the waves of a worldwide phenomenon? More Red Pills please.

At 240 a coin, I promise there will be another bubble. The inevitable nature of growth is inhalation and exhalation. Maybe the price will stabilize at 80,000. But what I am really hoping for is that the money from the next major influx will spread within the bitcoin economy. Maybe I didn't word my thoughts very well...

You make a compelling argument. Thank you. It is definitely set up to absorb an unlawful amount of profit from it's lending practices. Its an elitist industry which is built upon incestuous government relationships and ensures the continued slavery of the people. Its only threat is the
