Random question: has anyone ever asked BTC-E where they stand on ANY of this?  (both Bitcoin and Litecoin)
@_date: 2017-04-05 16:21:01
Great response! You effectively summed up my personal motivations for finally putting the idea down on paper, as well as the timing for the submission.  Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:13:18
It is what it is. I'll survive.

Thank you for the kind words and encouragement! I definitely agree with your assessment of the devs' current *burnout* and the *overloaded* nature of the issue.
This too shall pass.
@_date: 2017-04-06 16:12:30
Fair enough. Did you read my introduction, though?


Any feedback on the technical merits of the idea would still be much appreciated.

You were specifically addressing (and dismissing) a possible 2MB+SW option in your previous post based entirely on total block weight being too large.
I demonstrated to you that it is possible to implement such a solution without an immediate, or even eventual, increase to an 8MB block weight -- a soft fork could halt the increases at any point in the schedule -- while at the same time retaining all of the other benefits provided by SegWit.


It seems perfectly reasonable to completely reject new ideas based solely on the age of a posters' Reddit account, rather than the merit of the ideas themselves.  At what account age do you suggest I resubmit the proposal for your consideration?

If SW as a softfork fails to activate in November, then I do still hope they'll consider hardfork alternatives like mine seen here:

My initial thoughts were to incorporate Gavin's suggested solution from BIP109 in order to handle the immediate base size increase to 2MB. I believe that he solved the quadratic issue by simply limiting individual tx size to 1MB, but I could be wrong (or missing some specifics) since it's been a while since I looked at his code.  


I have not, but it's on my personal list of concerns and known issues. (See below for explanation)  


I have certainly reviewed some of the work listed on that page, and  I would absolutely incorporate their findings in a final BIP. However, to be completely honest, I would need to rely on their expertise to flesh out many of the answers to questions like yours.  
I sent private emails to the SW devs and others asking for assistance and feedback, but all of my emails went unanswered, and none of the devs have provided me with the requested feedback on the mailing list, in IRC, or via email. I reached out on each of those mediums, multiple times, but I was essentially told (by the one dev who did finally respond on IRC) that the current softfork version of SW is the only solution they're willing to discuss. They told me that if I want to develop a hardfork BIP, I will need to figure it out on my own (my interpretation: *go the hell away, we already scaled Bitcoin*).
Sadly, I just don't have the dev skills to pull it off on my own, so I've pretty much given up on the effort -- for now. I do plan to resubmit the draft BIP in November if the current softfork fails to activate, but who really knows what will happen between now and then? What could I add or change to inspire them to actually consider the idea and provide feedback?
I'd love to follow through on this idea, though, because I do still think it has merit as a workable compromise; but, I simply don't know how to pull it off without at least *some* support from the SW/Core devs.
Got any ideas? Help is something I never turn away.

Not necessarily.
Here's my proposed solution that would gradually increase the Total Block Weight from 2MB to 8MB over 3 years (can be adjusted any way we wish):
[BIP Draft] Base Size Increase and Segregated Witness with Discount Governors (SW-DGov) Hardfork](  
**It's essentially a combination of Gavin's BIP109, Adam's 2-4-8 idea, and SegWit w/Discount Governors.**
Example growth projections:  
Time|Base Size (bytes)|Total Discount|Total Block Weight (bytes)
Flag Day (FD)|2,000,000|0.0%|2,000,000
FD+24,192 Blocks|2,000,000 | 12.5% | 3,000,000
FD+48,384 Blocks| 2,000,000| 25.0%| 4,000,000
FD+72,576 Blocks| 2,000,000| 37.5% | 5,000,000
FD+96,768 Blocks| 2,000,000| 50.0% | 6,000,000
FD+120,960 Blocks| 2,000,000| 62.5% | 7,000,000
FD+145,152 Blocks| 2,000,000| 75.0% | 8,000,000
**NOTE:**  The "effective blocksize increase," or the number of transactions per block, would also scale linearly with each Discount increase.  
**Result:**  
**An immediate 100% increase in transactions per block (~4000 tx), scales to over 400% increase in transactions per block after 3 years (~8000+ tx).  It also retains all  of the other immediate benefits of SegWit, of course.**
I plan to resubmit this BIP for consideration if the SWSF fails to activate by November...
