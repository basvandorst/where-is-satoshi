I know that I definitely am.

Is there any way to get price alerts? Like if it hits a certain price or drops to a certain price? I've looked but haven't seen much.

Semi unrelated, anyone have a good alert system for prices? I'd like to have something good for iOS or just an SMS system. Haven't searched much but figured someone here has to have a good solution.

Awesome. Thank you!
@_date: 2015-07-10 20:34:38
Exactly what I thought. Haha. Just screams scam.

Nice. Thanks!

Wanted to buy last week but was hoping to see 240 before I bought again. Then this happens. No one knows. Now I'm trying to decide if I should buy now or wait and see if we see 260-270 again in the next few days. Haha. Never learn...

Number 3. Just don't be dicks. There can be a lot of them around here at times.

4.3921 coins/week right now. So, $3,000/week. Not sure if there are different account levels that would allow you more or not though. If so, mine is basic I'm sure.

Alright I have a super newbie question, I'm a dude who just likes the idea of bitcoin. I'm not some super techy guy or anything. I just like to buy a little bitcoin here and there whenever I have extra money and what not. My question, I've been trying to figure out for a while how to up the fees to speed things up. I normally buy from Circle and transfer to Bread. I've just never seen anything about it and I've wondered for awhile. Sorry again for the newb question. Ha. Thanks.

I figured that was the case. Thanks!

Awesome! Really appreciate the help. I'll probably switch to a more "real" wallet whenever I upgrade my computer. I'll check out that sub as well! I just really like learning and reading so I'll going to poke around some and try to expand my knowledge a bit. Thanks again for the help!
