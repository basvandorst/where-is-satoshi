For a legitimate profit generating service it's pretty damn good in my opinion. Plus, the shows they produce are typically of high quality.

What I don't understand is how this slow slow inflation of 1500 btc per day until the year 2150 isn't a huge contributing factor for why the price keeps falling. There is a very small amount of people who use btc. Most are either hoarding it or immediately converting it to fiat.  
If we stopped adding to the supply of btc, wouldn't the price remain more stable / stop going down?

Sorry, I'm really confused. A couple hours ago I made my first purchase of .3 BTC. Does that mean my order won't go through? I verified a bank account but not a CC.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:32:09
I just want my first transaction to go through. I'm missing out on all of these great discounts simply because I didn't know coinbase makes you wait before allowing you to make subsequent transactions. Come on crash; stay under $800 another week.

@_date: 2013-12-19 01:41:13
is a better place. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:17:09
Through coinbase, you have to verify a bank account first. That takes about 2 days. And then you can make your first purchase. After you receive your bitcoins 4 business days later you will be able to make multiple purchases on the same day. It will always take about 4 days to actually receive your Bitcoins but after that initial purchase goes through you can keep buying up to your daily limit of 10BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:19:44
A quick 3,000. Not bad. Hope you didn't sell all of them. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:57:15

Why are you limited to 100mB? What site are you using?
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:08:44
That's not a nice thing to say. You should apologize and offer a suggestion for a better app.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:44:05
Panic buy around 100mB.

So if I do an instant purchase I won't be subject to that fee? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:41:08
Not yet but thanks for the sentiment. Just got in it today actually but starting small. Made a $270 investment and going to watch it for a week before doing anything. I'm willing to lose $1,000 but no need to rush. I've lost more at the casinos. Technically I'm in the red $40 bucks at the current price. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:56:12
Purchased at $897. Feeling pretty okay about it.

@_date: 2013-12-07 15:13:01
I made my first purchase when I saw it around 850 thinking it wouldn't go lower. Had NO idea about the first purchase rule and missed the boat. Would have purchased 2BTC at ~600 but now have to wait until Thursday for my 300 mBTC to go through. The  anticipation is killing me. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:39:20
It's the worst. Luckily though, because it took two days to verify my bank account I was able to purchase at a rate of 897 / BTC as opposed to 1200. So trying to remain positive. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:02:20
Are you using coinbase?
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:38:20
You are wise beyond your years. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:20:17
I purchased 300 mBTC today (my first purchase) and my transaction will be finalized in a few days. The market was crazy today and I wanted to buy more but couldn't. After my first transaction goes through, will I be able to make multiple purchases in one day or am I limited to the 4 day waiting period every time I want to purchase more?
Note: I have not verified my identity or credit card yet. Not sure why I should bother with the 3.1% transaction fee.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:00:19
Luckily I have 2 hands. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:32:21
I accidentally purchased 0.3 when I meant to purchase more. I had no idea about the initial transaction waiting period.  I hate my life right now. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:18:49
If it ever goes back up to $850, will you send me some mBTC?
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:20:06
If you have any amount of money you're willing to potentially lose then it's worth investing. I got in at $897 and will patiently wait to buy more. Selling will happen when it's worth it. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:15:58
I have to wait until Thursday to actually receive. Haven't verified my CC or identity yet through the instant purchase. Maybe only the il instant pitcher has a limit? Are you using instant? Coinbase is down for everyone btw. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:42:59
I have no idea what you just said. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:29:27
Do we have any alternatives? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:27:06
Thank you so much for the clarification. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:44:07
"My next record available in bitcoin n delivered in a drone."  
You've got it all wrong Mr.Dogg.   
You're going to sell your record online in the form of a torrent file and we're going to purchase it around the world via bitcoin. This is the future of revamping the music industry's business model.   
BitTorrent + Bitcoin = Huge profits
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:05:43
You can monitor the market and potentially avoid a big loss. I'm still waiting for coinbase to verify my first transaction. I purchased 100mBTC. If I didn't have to wait until Thursday for my next transaction I would have purchased more as it dropped ~$100/ BTC. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:29:13
$897. Hoping next week will be a $500 kind of week.
