Can you elaborate why you're pessimistic? Imho, it's easy to confuse complex or difficult with impossible. I'm curious to know the top two or three problems you see in btc.

You're right but one could use a tumbler, use exchange to switch into untraceable alt coin, go fiat in person, etc. There are risks and mitigations. Might be more untraceable in the future with lightning network, zero knowledge proofs, etc.

There's a lot of literature on this. Rothbard and the Austrian school have been working on this for a while. Mises university has some good articles too if you don't mind econ jargon.
Ask yourself how someone having a monopoly on printing money is good. That's the real question.
Basically, there are different types of deflation. Need to be careful which one you're taking about. India just deflated their currency by invalidating 85% of their money. That's bad deflation. Deflation also happens when there's no faith in the economy and people hoard money like in the depression. This is partly why it has a bad reputation. Good deflation is basically when society gets wealthier without increasing monetary supply. With decreases in costs and increases to productivity and efficiency, goods and services get cheaper. Purchasing power increases.

Free market advocates don't say the government does nothing good just that it would be more moral and efficient in a free market (I.e. Voluntary exchange).
You can point to the internet because the government spent X million dollars on it and say that's a good thing. But, you don't see all the people who didn't get to spend their money how they wanted to. You don't see the waste. You don't see all the other things that weren't created instead.
The question of how good something is in economics, which deals with the use of scarce resources which have alternative uses, is "compared to what?". Yes, the government collects money at gunpoint and uses some of it to pay for basic science and other cool shit. But how good of a job is it doing compared to free markets?

From what I understand, the lightning network requires a fix transaction malleablity, 
SegWit is one possible fix. If it gets adopted, I think you'll see lightning networks soon after.

For example? Top two or three in your opinion?

Maybe, but maybe not. Maybe you should do it. :)
