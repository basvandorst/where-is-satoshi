On the nano S when you click on the transaction a box comes with the tx details. There is a magnifying glass for the blockchain link and next to it is a lightening bold tab, that is the accelerator but it doesn't work.
I'm too scared to do a double spend because that contract is now null and void as I didn't pay within 24 hours. I also am not sure how to do a double spend. In the support notes it says that with nano s it is not possible to double spend anyway.

So in my case, what can I do about this transaction? Just wait 2 weeks until it comes back?

So then the 2 week rule doesn't work. Talk about confusing? Thanks.

I would like to update this to everyone that tried to help and also others watching.
Today (1 week later) I had to do another BTC payment. This time I used the normal suggested fee by the NANO S. My first confirmation came through within 10 minutes. My unconfirmed transaction also went through at this time, I am relieved and surprised. This can not be a coincidence can it? It was lingering for 1 week then I did another transaction not connected to this one and it went through. What happened?
Now I have to negotiate with the supplier of the goods I wish to purchase as the prices have changed dramatically. They have my money, no choice here.
I was not comfortable to go through the process "treasionaire" suggested as I am not that clued up technically plus I kept reading that many wallets will not allow that procedure. But thank you for your help, I might have had to try and do that in the end.
So guys and girls, my message to you all is please don't skimp on the fees, just pay them to be sure your transaction goes through, it isn't worth the headaches later. Thank you all.

This is what Ledger says in it's support. But it gives no times nor does it say it will send it out again when it drops. This is not really a very good system. Needs a lot of improvement.
If this happens, you need to be patient, and wait for your transaction to be achieved, even if it can take days, or wait until it is definitively rejected by the miners. When it is rejected, your operation will disappear of your list of operations in your Ledger wallet.
