Using a word like "boomer" makes you sound 13.
Are you 13?

This is why Monero.
Yeah yeah yeah, "but THAT'S a shitcoin bruhhh".
So, what?
Given the current conditions on Bitcoin, if you want privacy, then MONERO.
Will this change with lightning, onion routing, etc? Yes, it will.
But for now, we have Monero. Fucking use it.

So again...watch and learn.

Agreed. I have personally met dozens of guys doing time with insane sentences for non-violent drug offenses.
The DEA are scumbags profiting from the drug trade.

Dumb as fuck. 
The self identifying "millennial" that made this obviously wasn't around in 1991.
Nobody even knew wtf "streaming" was, or even the concept of it, in 1991.
God I hate your kind.

"Almost obsolete"
You have the perspective of a 16 year old American child.
Go to India and tell them the generations of gold they have accumulated is "obsolete".
If you think gold is going to just disappear, you're just wrong. 
...did silver disappear when gold became the standard? 
Ugh, why do I reply?

Freedom is relative.
Nowhere is free.
But as far as freedom goes, as in..let's say freedom of speech, America is lucky as fuck.
Country I live in 8 months of the year? I fucking DARE YOU to say something bad about their gov't on social media.
Americans = spoiled rich kids that cry because daddy bought them the wrong colored car for their birthday.

Actually, no.
It works because people buy Bitcoin anonymously by buying Amazon gift cards in cash from places like Walmart, and then sell them on sites like Paxful for 60% of the value to buy BTC.
Paxful buyers then use those Amazon gift codes on Purse and make the difference in the spread. 
Why would someone want to buy Bitcoin this way? Think darknet markets...
Amazon Turks? Ha...like 5% of purse.io traffic.

Statute of limitations on federal drug crimes is 5 years...this is why he wasn't charged for the drugs, only the money laundering. 
Money laundering also has a 5 year statute of limitations UNLESS you commit an additional overt act that restarts that 5 year limitation.  (That overt act was moving coins to exchange to sell for fiat.)
My question is, why did they wait so long to charge him? Was he a cooperating witness? Did they KNOW he was Pharmaville, but could never connect him to the drugs, so they waited for him to move the coins? 
A lot of unanswered questions. I really want to read the discovery in this case when it becomes available. (Probably riddled with parallel construction, though. I personally love playing the game "spot the lie/parallel construction" in federal indictments. It's entertaining.)

Hurr Durr, you're poor.
You're poor because you're terrified of taking risk...and try to shit on those that do to make yourself feel better about being a little bitch.
You will never amount to shit. Every girl that has ever seen you knows it, and that is why nobody touches your pathetic little penis. Sad.
