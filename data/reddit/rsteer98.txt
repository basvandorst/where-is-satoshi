As someone who stumbled upon this sub from the random button, I ask you, a user who seems to have his shit together on the topic, do you think BitCoin could become a major international currency? A common currency adopted by most powerful nations? Also, it is possible to open up a business and make profit in America. Here's an example: I buy land. I renovate the building. I buy a giant freezer and start my ice cream shop. Within a few years the costs of starting and maintaing the business will be paid for and I will start to profit. Could one possibly do this with BitCoin mining? Like I buy a building to house servers/pcs. I buy the stuff needed. I start mining all day, every day? Would I eventually find profit. Is it like a business in this way? Do people do this?
If you answer this, you are saintly. :)

How many blocks are found? How often does one average finding a block? Is one block equal to one Bitcoin? It was my impression that the more BitCoin there are in circulation, the harder it is to find a block. I learned this a few years ago so I guess I just sorta thought it became like impossible.

I was more wondering whether or not people do it. Like as a business sort of. I have a pretty basic foundation of how bitcoin works. I was just wondering if people actually find coins

Thanks for enlightening me! So are you saying it is smart to buy the hardware and pay for the electricity because for the time being it will most likely give some nice profit? I am a student, so don't feel like your answer will make me buy or not buy into this. I kind of physically can't.

Thank you. Never would have found this myself.
For some reason when I try to be nice on reddit, it always sounds sarcastic. This is not meant to be sarcastic.
