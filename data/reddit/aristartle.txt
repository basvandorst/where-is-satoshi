Okay I was an idiot and clicked the link. Is this just a bad attempt at fud, or was it a phishing attempt. I honestly don't know
@_date: 2014-04-07 03:38:30
Unfortunately no lol I think that would be great fun though. I love plants in general and enjoy the occasional toke, so when it is legal in a state I have property I will definitely add that to the list

Absolutely no genetic manipulation in any seeds I use to the best of my knowledge. I've taken great pains to source the highest quality seeds I could. The majority, but not all, were certified organic when I originally bought my first seeds. 
I do have some flowers that I cannot speak to the genetics of for sure. This whole operation evolved on me much more quickly than I imagined, so when I started I was buying flowers just because they were on my 'cool/awesome' plant list that were hard to find. When I found them, I bought them. I do my best to replace them with better quality when I can, but to be honest I'm reasonably certain that I've never purchased gm seeds. The problem is that people at seed swaps don't always care about this type of thing and just don't know themselves. But I know which are which and will inform any buyer where I sourced from. Or maybe I'll only sell the ones I know the exact genetics of...I'm working this out on the fly lol
Obviously I have lists that I would supply that includes all this information so if I did put up some type of store you would know this when buying. 
Edit: Also, out of curiosity what are 'rare' seeds to you?

Where do you draw the line though. I know we all love bitcoin, but does that suddenly make an otherwise meaningless amount valuable? Isn't 100 bits like 5 cents? With no offense meant to anyone, 5 cents is worthless, whether its in bitcoin or a nickel. You can't do anyhting with it. You can't even withdraw the btc from changetip. 
Not to mention, if people are going to other subreddits to tip these amounts, this is not going to interest people in bitcoin. It'll make us look very spammy, and to be honest, that seems to be the reason people are doing it. 
If you actually value someones post, tip them something meaningful

If I recall correctly, the btc weren't part of the company's assets in the docs
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:47:17
No, but if they freeze something I and a lot of other people have a lot of money invested in, I expect them to give some type of notice. If everything were okay, why wouldn't they?
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:06:15
Yea, a random dude with bitcoins. Exchanges are just intermediaries... 
@_date: 2014-05-16 12:22:29
3 cents is not generous. Its stupid.
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:44:29
good catch. is this just fud or a phishing attempt?
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:03:30
No problem, I figure thats definitely a selling point and you've done a great job marketing them on your site, in my opinion. That was the only concern/hesitation I had, so I wouldn't want others passing by you for that reason. When I don't see it clearly marked, I always assume its the cheaper, less good alternative

Purchased. Looking forward to them. Definitely interested in different styles as well. I know some people who would love these.
Edit: I agree with others, pictures or some type of way to get a feel for the size would be helpful. I would buy more, but for now I figure one pair is good. My wife has a small head while mine is big, so I figure either way someone will be pleased lol
Edit2: Polarized lenses is a big deal for me. At first it wasn't clear that yours were and I was disappointed til I found the specs. I'd make it more readily apparent when you first are looking at the site/designs that all your lenses are polarized.
Edit3: In fact, going back to the site, it doesn't even say they are anywhere in the listings. Only on the bottom of the 'about' page. I'd put that disclaimer that the lenses are polarized and full uv protection is standard either below the sunglasses on the page where you choose the design or even on every individual listing.

From what I understand, our investments should be fine. I have a few hundred shares and am not worried at all right now.
While I have no information regarding what triggered the halt, this should eventually be sorted out and we will eventually gain access to the shares. This will likely take some time as they figure out whatever is going on, but the whole point of this is to protect the rest of the investors, their shares, and the value of said shares.

I figure a lot of people are, but theres still a lot of zones no where near ready for outdoor planting so maybe I can help some of the procrastinators. And who knows, by next year I could have a nice little operation set up, depending on how well I can scale and collect. I've never really tried for maximum seed collection so I have no idea how many I can actually save. It'll be fun to see.
@_date: 2014-04-25 14:38:06
I'm excited about this...
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:54:50
You want really rare! No, I do not have any yellow tamarillo seeds...I'll keep you in mind though. I have a network of other farmers/growers/gardeners that MAY have some but I don't think so. I'll also keep you in mind for the glass gem corn and gooseberries. I honestly need to do inventory. We are in the process of upsizing. We're looking for a much larger piece of land then we currently have so that we can really expand. As far as fruit goes, that all depends. We're mostly on the mainland USA but do have family/friends with land in Hawaii that we do work on. The fruit we have there is just phenomenal and we have great seeds. Unfortunately I don't know how difficult it is to get permission to ship hawaiian seeds out of the state. I thikn hard. But I'll be working on the catalog/inventory this week and get back to you.

At that price you also get landscaping for life, congratulations!

Whats the deal with tulips and bitcoin? I'm serious, I don't know...
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:17:31
I have the same amount of people ahead of me as I ever had so it appears as though you have been more successful then most at inviting?
@_date: 2014-04-06 19:24:15
Working on this. Like I said, I never thought of actually selling them before other than locally and trading at swaps. A catalog won't take much time but I'm replacing an old greenhouse with a new project today so I won't have anything today. 
As far as Canada goes, yes? I'll have to look at laws and whatnot as I'm not trying to become an international seed criminal but I don't see why it would be a problem...
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:16:09
No. If we wanna be technical, logically there is nothing in my statement from which you can deduce that it is betterish to not know names. In fact trying to make that claim based off of my claims would be an invalid argument. 
BTC-e thus far has been reliable. I'm not aware of any legitimate claims to anyone ever not getting their coins or any theft occuring. They have done nothing wrong but be anonymous, which for many people was a major reason they were originally attracted to bitcoin, the anonymity. 
Personally, I have accounts with coinbase, bitstamp, btc-e, bitfinex, coinsetter, and buttercoin. I very actively trade and I figure by spreading my trading coins out, I eliminate the chances of all of my coins ever being run away with. 
My point was that precautions should be taken with your money so that you don't have to trust these exchanges.
But I am also defending btc-e a little bit because they have always offered very good security and service to me. I don't worry about the coins I do have there.
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:46:37
Yea I got excited when I saw your post. I imagine it'll be soon though. This is speculation, but with no date guaranteed to the public, I would not be surprised if they waited to launch until we reach some area of stabilization as far as price goes. Right now they're guaranteed to get a lackluster response. A ton of people are in fiat, which means moving money over to the new exchange would be more difficult compared to transferring bitcoin over. Right now it would be 'risky' to buy in to transfer money over, especially considering that liquidity will be lowish so being able to move back to fiat in the event of a drop would be difficult.
Hence my speculation that they want to wait until safer times to get a proper launch going.

@_date: 2014-04-06 19:26:39
Yea thats what I've been thinking. It really can't hurt. I'm going to get a catalog together in the next couple days and throw a website together if my coding skills haven't waned too much from lack of practice.

How long will it last? Where in PA are you guys?

An ATM and a bitcoin 'atm' are very different and the distinction is important. With an atm the bank literally has your money, and you are withdrawing it from them in the same currency to use the currency in a different medium, I.e. cash. 
Your language makes it seem as though these people are holding your money hostage and you have no way to use it or get it out without the atm. Number one, you're changing currencies. A bank atm isnt exposed to the exchange rate risk. They are literally just processing a transaction. These guys have to send your money to an exchange, exchange for the other currency, etc. The costs with doing this are much higher As is the risk compared to just moving money from an account in the same currency.
When you consider its an atm that literally allows immediate currency exchange, its pretty cool. Sure the costs could come down a little and it will with more competition, but for now if your that unhappy, do the work theyre providing you yourself and stop bitching. Send your money to an exchange, pay any associated fees, change currencies, and send your money or bitcoin back out on top of the percent an exchange is gonna take. Plus wait 3-5 days or more for the whole process to take place. Or use localbitcoins and pay a similar percentage anyway, again more hassle.

Yea there are limits, but nothing I have to worry about hitting. And really interesting info, I've loosely followed bitcoin for all this time but not enough to be aware of these trends. Very much appreciated, I'm definitely gonna keep an eye out for this.

I used coinbase for my purchase already so am on my way towards ending the 30 day waiting period, however I haven't used any id. I did connect my bank account. Will not having my id be a problem if i need to move my coins back into usd?
Also, why do you say coins will be cheap come september? 
@_date: 2013-07-16 02:24:13
Yes, this is indeed the one...  Isn't it frustrating when bitcoin downloads data on your computer?
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:28:31
Actually it provides a lot of value at this early stage. The higher the market cap, the bigger the businesses that can feasibily entertain introducing bitcoin. Right now holding is making them more scarce and therefore increasing the market cap.
Spending is great for the economy, holding is great for creating the economy. Much, much more complicated, but those who decide to hold are just as much a part of this great bitcoin experiment as those using it to buy goods and services.

For what its worth Fairbrix was Charles Lee's first coin. It got off to a rough start so he created Litecoin addressing some issues with fairbrix

Maybe try even older addresses? Or could it be something else you are getting wrong. I can't remember what else you need in step 1
@_date: 2013-09-30 16:53:08
Have you gotten to the questions portion? Like 'with which name are you affiliated' and 'how long have you been associated with this address'?
If so, try changing the duration of time for the time at the address, that worked for me...
