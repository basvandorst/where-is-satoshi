I would say that more people are selling than buying at the moment.

It took me a while to understand what Bitcoin *really* is.
I always thought/heard about it in the sense of mining for profit... but never had the capital to start up (I was late to the game).
Once (what I perceived as) the true end-goal and long term benefits of Bitcoin became clear to me... I decided to dive in. I haven't been investing heavily but I do a daily purchase (dollar weighted averaging) and intend to hold for the foreseeable future. I'm not in this for "USD appreciation on my investment". I'm in this for the intrinsic value of Bitcoin itself.

I'm 2 for 6 I think. Even the 2 that worked were painful. As in... being told that I don't know what I'm talking about until I ask to show them. Then they act offended that I knew something they didn't.
It's great in theory... horrible in execution.
I'll stick with Circle and Coinbase... If I feel the need for anonymity I'll just go with local bitcoins.

Yup... I have a $20 recurring buy... then 1 hour later I push $15 to a Trezor long-term-hodl address... and the final 5 to my mycelium-based wallet.
*Edit: Remember.. if you don't control the private keys... you don't really own the coins.

I buy $20 worth of Bitcoin every day.

I only "big buy" when i realize i have a few spare bucks that aren't already spoken for.
I honestly just try to forget about Bitcoin entirely for the most part... until I check my progress.

Probably nowhere.
That works out to $622/coin.... last i checked the price of a bitcoin was around $675
