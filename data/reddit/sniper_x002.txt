He likely hash more hashing power, and thus reaches .01 once a week.

Yeah I was gonna say, maybe so much was moved around because it was being emptied from one wallet to another.

If you know anything about freesync it's basically that but for NVIDIA. 
Otherwise, it's a solution to screen tearing (where the screen displayed is not synced from bottom to top - showing a tear in the middle). Another common solution is Vsync, which doesn't require any special monitor. Thing is, Vsync usually adds quite a bit of input delay so it's usually not used in fast competitive games.
I'm no expert though so if you want to find out more I'd just google it.

Oh don't get me wrong, I also play on a very similar sized 1080p TV, input lag is great (I play cs on it too!) but I also have this 4K TV where the input lag is probably like half a second and it makes most games unplayable.

If I had to choose between a 70 inch 4k TV and a 1440p high refresh rate monitor (with gsync).. it would completely depend on the TV's input lag. 
I'm assuming the TV would have pretty bad input lag, like basically all of them do, so I'd probably go with the monitor. But it would be close.
Now if it were 3 1080p monitors, high refresh rate, gsync, vs the 4K tv, I would definitely pick the monitors.

Is there a big reason the transaction fee is so high? I'm wanting to add $10 to steam but it costs $32 worth of bitcoin right now. Will it go down soon?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:28:34
We're only $300 away from that right now.

That doesn't help. I can't fathom five.
