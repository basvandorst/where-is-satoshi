I love how shitposts, spin and memes float to the front page of this sub but actual news barely gets a look in

Riiiight. If there’s 100 million millionaires out there that see $60k as ‘not a lot of money’ then I’ll eat my ass... and why in the world would these imaginary millionaires dump their cash into bitcoin so that some nobody redditors can walk away with access to their money in the shape of a $400,000 coin? That’s the dumbest investment opportunity ever.
Besides, everyone knows bitcoin exists now so I’m pretty confident most of the mega-millionaires that are interested are already in the game, and they are only here to turn a fiat profit while the hype lasts.

More like poor to the rich. What a dumb quote 
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:16:48
Millenial greed.
It’s basically driven by the dream that investing in bitcoin will give free riches for nothing. Meanwhile, wealthy traders keep milking investors all while telling them to ‘hodl’ and ‘buy the dip’ so the suckers keep the bubble from bursting

I don’t know what you mean by street savvy and I don’t know those guys individual stories but at a guess I’d say their endorsement is due to potential personal gain from bitcoin.
Anyways all I’m saying is the tech guys might be endorsing it because they get how the tech works, but the money guys aren’t endorsing it because they get how the world works.
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:25:15
Yeah it has undeniable value for this purpose however this is not what’s contributing towards its current fiat bubble value
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:15:14
It’s not it’s past performance or future I’m concerned about here.... when you buy bitcoin you take full responsibility for protecting your asset - one rookie mistake or accident and that $300k is gone for good �� scary
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:48:22
Ehhhh it’s not hard to imagine a million people putting $1k into bitcoin for various reasons but I don’t see finding a hundred million willing to put like $60k into bitcoin ‘easy’.
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:22:22
Unless you have hundreds of btc you’re gloating over pocket change right now... pocket change you might lose one day. I’ll drink some of that wine :)
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:02:02
Haha don’t you love bitcoin retards... they make all these decentralized, anti-bank claims and then mock you for not directly linking your banking details. Tools
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:59:27
Any number of things, but in the spirit of your question I’ll say time killed it. Tech gets outdated at an ever increasing rate, and bitcoin is already outdated as a thing. Give it a little time and eventually the cracks will be to big to hide in the face of a better, more efficient and reliable alternative.
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:26:59
Yeah okay, keep hodling away then... just don’t moan when someone sweeps the fiat value out from underneath you and leaves you with your wonderful bitcoins
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:43:10
Maybe because explaining imaginary money to your parents is like telling them about your imaginary friend... it all makes sense when you’ve got the kind of a child
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:40:24
I would feel more comfortable storing $300k in my neighbor’s sock draw than I would in bitcoin �� you’ve got balls dude
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:12:19
You should be scared. Bitcoin is a ‘decentralised’ scam... it’s all about getting out before it collapses.
How long will it last? How high will it go? No-one knows, except for those that do. Enjoy the ride buddy, just don’t be one of the many that get left behind when the money stops coming and the big boys pull out :)
Gambling is fun until you’ve lost everything!

Hills don’t go up forever you know, they go back down at some point... all the way back down
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:02:44
Because bitcoin is a load of shit and any efforts to improve it just expose it as a load of shit so the heavily invested fight against change in an attempt to protect their digital monopoly moneys credibility. The second people truly realize it’s not safe, decentralized or of any real world value whatsoever is the day it falls apart, and recent investors can’t afford that to happen
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:17:55
In 2025 the real answer to that question will make you wish you were still in that coma 
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:52:32
Cryptocurrencies are a fad; once the upper ceiling of the market cap is reached panic selling will cripple any major future interest in ‘decentralized’ currency as a store of value. They will continue to exist but only really appeal to a nerd market who think they are fringe for trading crypto for video game items.
After that the only cryptos of real value will be government/corporate/finance backed initiatives that will use it like an actual currency within whatever network it’s designed for.
10 years from now...? I really doubt crypto will exist in the form it does today, as likely a new technology or protocol will render it obsolete.
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:32:48
You can accidentally lose $25 million dollars very easily though, with no chance of getting it back
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:42:47
No one is serious about crypto, they are only in it for fiat gains.
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:08:32
The reason I can’t ever see it as a asset people throw their retirement into is the same reason it’s popular right now - it’s ‘decentralized’ and not backed by anything. While the value may continue to grow, security-wise owning bitcoin is no different to storing cash in your mattress, if not even riskier. It only takes 1 simple mistake for your entire fortune to be lost forever. How solid the code is is irrelevant... there’s a million ways hackers could lift your info and a million ways you could easily misplace or destroy your investment without any chance of recovery.
Anyways all I can say is holy shit, it’s surprisingly wonderful to see someone on these forums that isn’t blindly in love with crypto and can understand its shortcomings 
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:16:41
... or maybe the tech geeks want to see a tech succeed so they are endorsing it whereas these big money scumbags know how the finance game works so they can see how it doesn’t stand a chance in the long run? Probably a more realistic way to assess the situation don’t you think...
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:44:24
Everyone buying in now is too late to the game.
If you hold upward of a dozen coins already and don’t get too greedy then you’re going to walk away smiling but buying 2 coins now... mehhh.
At the very best I can’t see this thing rising beyond $25k a coin.... so with your 2 coins that’s about $40k profit - not bad at all, but not life changing. Is that ‘potential’ $40k going to be worth all the stress of monitoring such a volatile investment though? Is it going to be worth ‘potentially’ losing your $12k? Up to you...
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:22:31
Wait until it drops another thousand before you sell so you can tell everyone how much money you donated to them
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:10:21
Because the next fork is just around the corner and people don’t want to miss out on what they believe may be free money.
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:57:12
It doesn’t have truly limited supply though, only artificially limited. There’s nothing to separate bitcoin from other crypto outside the brandname, which is constantly under attack from forks that break its credibility.
Bitcoin is just a digital fad riding on a hype wave, but hype can only last for so long. Eventually the unexplained value gains will grind to a halt, and so will buyer confidence (considering most are buying in purely for financial gain).
The only thing keeping this currency in the spotlight (besides being the first) are the traders and bots manipulating the market as they keep milking investors pump and dump style. My personal belief is that it’ll max out at around $25k (at best) and then plummet drastically as the whales cash in on their handiwork.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:00:11
That used to be the reason, only people aren’t using it that way so now they are pretending it’s the new gold... basically the bitcoin community says whatever bs they need to convince others (and themselves) that there’s more to this than just dreams of riches.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:38:18
Seems like cult worship 
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:54:44
Bitcoin’s value is a combination of millenial’s greed and laziness multiplied by the amount of fiat they are willing to dump in desperation to get rich, further propagated by whatever lies they think will drive this thing upward.
