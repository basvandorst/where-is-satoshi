I think the first part of your statement is a little contradictory.  Aside from the obvious lack of private keys security, does it sound like a good idea to manage funds when you don't even have access to the hardware wallet the funds are stored in?  I haven't even touched base on the fact that it doesn't sound like he had a proper backup other than his memory.

Damn they must've sent him like 2,000,000 BCH then lol

Perfect, that makes me more bullish.

No they're not.

People have no clue what they're doing. I can't believe this guy was managing money for friends.

That money is long gone. Cotten probably lost it all in the meat grinder on Bitmex going 100x long in the bear market.

This is centralized in it's current form. I would not use this. It's simply an attempt to gain more control over network transactions. I'm a BTC maximalist, but come on Blockstream.  This is disappointing, especially for someone whose been in this space since 2013. 
Don't even bother releasing second layer or side chain solutions unless it's trustless. I expect more from these devs who all know better.   
My money will never travel across a two way peg centralized by 23 companies.  Blockstream complain about BCH being centralized, which it is, and then deliver this centralized transaction play?  This is simply embarrassing.  
And might I add to anyone sending praise saying this will be great for exchanges, no it's not because this continues to make centralized exchanges revelant. Decentralized exchanges should be the focus with second layer solutions which I know a lot of people are working hard for. Thank you to those devs keeping true to the trustless ideology. Don't trust, verify!

He's not making money, he's bored with the diminishing volume and sideways price action like the rest of us. Otherwise he wouldn't be wasting valuable time posting this nonsense.

I thought I saw a BCH chart in there. Get the pitch forks boys!

It doesn't matter what exchanges are better off doing since they're just out to profit from trades. Whatever brings more users and volume is fine with them. This solution, delivered by Blockstream and it's members aka exchanges are looking to control transactions and stay relevant in the face of emerging technology whilch will facilitate decentralized exchanges.  Blockstream and their business partners (exchanges) have marketed this in a way that it is misleading to new users by putting their business priorities first and loses focus of don't trust, verify ideology.  
If you're using centralized exchanges, you should withdrawal your currency to your own wallet in which you control the keys. If you choose to send it elsewhere the do so from your own wallet. Why take a risk sending money across a centralized solution? 
Most traders will simply be chasing trades and trends if they need to move money across exchanges this quickly.  This will generate more volume and fees for Blockstreams business partners the exchanges.  Markets we're designed to take money from the impatient and transfer it to the patient.  Traders should be focused on planning trades ahead of time, placing coins on exchanges with bids/asks set in advance of price action instead of centralized hype.

He's been buying for 11 months?

I would recommend you focus on a fair launch by allowing people interested in your project to mine it. Build up a community based on the fundamentals and then exchanges will list it because of the user demand. 
This is exactly how Bitcoin started and may take a long time but if fair and noteworthy it will happen. 
If you're not satisfied with this answer work on atomic swaps for your coin with Bitcoin and get your project integrated on decentralized exchanges like altcoins.io and if all else fails start your own. 
IMO it's not worth catering to centralized exchanges since they will giving up market share soon.

The argument goes both ways. You can do more with less in a deflationary currency.
