Excellent comment!! I support another coin and I too must acknowledge that it has its own competition and it's own flaws - there are no certainties and to complacently ignore (or even worse: automatically discredit) competition is simply naive. Lest MySpace repeats itself.
I think the next winner is one that will have practical &amp; widespread use-cases (+user adoption), imo there is a clear leader. Key risks (for any coin) are regulation clampdown and competition. For competition risks, I think the private blockchain projects (incl both government backed projects and private consortium's like hyperledger) have potential to create competing blockchain's/protocols.
Time will tell, at least it won't be a boring ride!

better q: what happens if some of these ico's actually become functional &amp; viable i.e. add monetisable value to society

Read research on dpos (multiple), pos (ethereum) &amp; tangle (iota) for alternative approaches to managing transactions on a blockchain.
You may find out there's some some great new tech that picked up where bitcoin left off.

South Africa, Ghana and Nigeria. As a soft indicator: Google trend: "Bitcoin" and look at top country over last two months. SA 1st, Ghana 9th, Nigeria 14th.
For hard indicators you can look at exchange volumes.
Also you're right about Africa's size: Africa has a landmass exceeding USA + China + Europe all added together:

Please Eli5 why being defined as a security is so bad? Especially for new ico's worried about legislation ..Surely if they are legitimate businesses then they will work towards increasing te token value (i.e. they should be ok with their token being defined as a security)?

I think points 3 &amp; 4 are correct (possibly similar enough to be considered one point) - but the importance of this point cannot be underestimated: the network effect is a massive advantage over every other coin. 
I disagree that 1 &amp; 2 are any competitive advantage i.e. yes Bitcoin has excellent security &amp; developer 'braintrust' *but* Bitcoin is on par with other coins, not superior.
Finally ..is 4 points enough??
I think one point you missed was the ability to add any innovations/features which new coins come up with  ..problem is that Bitcoin politics arguably slow down the rate of change/adoption/adaption and this, to me, poses the largest risk; in this fast-evolving space, Bitcoin may not be agile enough? i.e. MySpace.
I welcome disagreement.

I don't think your explanation for USD demand was remotely adequate (you literally even compare bitcoins to diamonds in your post above). You also didn't address most of the other issues I raised. I sincerely suggest you first understand what fiat is before commenting in a bitcoin forum. Bitcoin may not replace the usd (though you never brought up any of the more substantial usd arguments and you conveniently forget that btc use-cases extend beyond a "dollar replacement") - but a blockchain will likely run *all* global finances within 10 years. If you don't see that as more than "pokemon" then I suggest starting with Swiss banking relationship to bitcoin, from there you could consider why Europe, Japan, Australia China, Russia, India et al changed their national policy to accommodate cryptocurrency. Finally it's worth considering why every major corporation is actively building processes onto a blockchain (or subscribing to software provider to do it for them). I work for a multinational asset manager so perhaps my views are skewed by 'seeing' the evidence - even if you don't witness the change, you can still access insight with basic research. Every consultancy  (deloitte, EY, McKinsey etc have papers with good insight ..also academia Cambridge Yale Harvard etc have more than enough research). If you still don't see any value then that's ok, the future really is uncertain (despite strong probability in favour of blockchain-based currency) - we wish you well regardless and, for your sake, maybe the world won't change it's financial system despite historic evidence to the contrary.

You mad! Haha ..Seriously (and sincerely) though, I respect your expertise but; do you truly think there's not even one amazon rose tucked away in that ico bed of thorns? Surely you can appreciate the technical-simplicity of solidity; creating a particularly effective entry point to crypto? Surely, despite the obvious risks, you would still put favourable odds on VB's team successfully sharding? No hate for BTC as we are well aware of the depth of talent/ability ..i just don't think any proBTC arguments implicitly make ETH "crap".
Eth just made their 'app store' quicker &amp; with more versatility than anyone else ..yes it always starts out with shitty apps, yes some bubbles need to pop. but I have this suspicion that one or two (of the 1000's of beta projects) might pleasantly surprise us all.
**Tl:dr Interested to hear why you haven't invested, even a small allocation, in ETH**

The "right to ..pay an obligation" makes no sense.
"That alone gives it sufficient demand to be accepted" no.  Intrinsic value is not a function of tax demand. I'm sure you are intelligent but this statement isn't.
"USD's are an abstract concept" ..choice words. 
"Iou's linked to actual property" no.  ..how do you expect us constructively engage in an argument when you make statements like this? 
Regarding the networks "obligation" ..You're confusing obligation with incentives. Consider incentives in the fiat system before engaging this argument.
Rights &amp; claims: this is the intrinsic value argument; you have a claim against fiat insofar as a person with fiat demands BTC. Multiple tangible assets are also available on blockchain's e.g. you may claim gold for BTC's
Libertarian world: majority of blockchain development is done by corporations, particularly global banks. It doesn't have a political agenda unless you determine 'no agenda' as being an agenda. The system can be applied to (and used for) various different 'politics'. 
Authority: you're confusing no authority with decentralised authority. These two are *very* different.
So   ...journalist for the FT or Finance grad?

Why is the value of a US dollar and a diamond real? 
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:04:56
Do you really not realise this is the same description of fiat? Just swap out 'cryptographic process' for 'monetary policy';)

"F..ing nothing" ...except quicker, cheaper &amp; safer transactions ..even with Bitcoins early/young teething problems it's already arguably a more versatile currency than USD. Send some dollars to be cashed out in Australia and I'll race you with some bitcoins. Once you realise transactions aren't limited to financial services, you will see how cryptography creates **trust** (that "wasted computation" you carelessly refer to). This **trust** *materially* increases the efficiency of most modern processes (which are delayed in time &amp; cost by verifying trust) ..simple e.g.'s: auditing, medical records, legal disputes, almost every facet of the asset management industry, property rights [this one is particularly relevant to your later comments], marketing where attention is monetised, &amp; most facets of finance such as financing loans, insurance contract integrity &amp; transactional banking.
Remember *your* personal finances will soon be run on a blockchain: every major global bank has an active blockchain project in development - the technology of which can be directly credited to the pioneering cryptography application of **Bitcoin.**
So are the bitcoin believers really the delusional people or do they simply have foresight? Maybe, delusion is more fairly attributed to a person who believes, that the best way to run global finances is by; using conventional fiat Dollars, managed by the monetary policy decisions of a small group of privately incentivised people (who aren't audited but who do enjoy a money-printer), backed with *lots &amp; lots* of debt, effected on a global exchange platform as old and inefficiencient as swift.

He ironically described the US dollar while explaining his doubts over crypto.
(Over)Valuation is plausible given the speculative nature of crypto (fundamentals don't outweigh speculation yet) - but his oversimplification of cryptography value (as a fad/ponzi) overlooks *any* of the use-cases we know exist. I understand him doubting the 'crypto community' but to ignore corporate adoption is simply idiotic.
This poor generalisation is an embarrassing oversight for such an esteemed writer. Worse, I suspect he will feel vindicated when any corrections take place ..though his price to pay is missing the valuation 'dripping roast' of buying panic dips (as he famously did with junk bonds in GFC 2008) ..we all know the trade of our decade is buying the next crypto crash.
Historic fundamentals are valuable, but they need to be complimented with current progress in order to be useful throughout the cycle, because while cycles 'rhyme' they do also evolve out of pure repetition.
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:59:46
Politics have kind of always been around in some form - agreed current levels are holding back progress (which simply isn't sustainable in the fast-growing and competitive cryptoland).
Have you considered  Factom, Polkadot, iota, ethereum? ..If you still believe in crypto but not btc then why don't you focus some research efforts on the newer projects?
