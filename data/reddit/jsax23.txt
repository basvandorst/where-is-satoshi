Name one that’s of equal value right now with an unlimited supply and of equal value to bitcoin. You can’t. And the reason is partially due to the supply. If there was an abundance of bitcoin the price/value would drop. It’s like investing, the more shares of Apple there are to buy the lower the price of the share. The less shares there are to buy the higher the price. This is a just a plain old fact of economics.

People still hoard dollars, it’s called savings. 
If bitcoin were widely accepted it would be used more. The only reason people use credit cards is because they are widely accepted. If they weren’t, people wouldn’t use them as much. 
Be well. I’m signing off.

There is a max amount of ethereum available to buy RIGHT NOW. In order to create more ethereum it needs to be mined. If tomorrow 1 million ethereum was made available to anyone that went to make me rich.com what do you think would happen to the price of ethereum? Would everyone suddenly be rich because now they have 1 million ethereum at $300 each, or would the price tank and be worth almost nothing?

Because then it wouldn’t be worth much of anything. The limited supply among other things  is what helps set the value of the coin.

Again, an incorrect assumption. The US dollar was backed by a limited supply of gold at one point, were people hoarding US dollars because it was backed by a limited supply of gold? No, they continued to US it as currency because they trusted in the currency, and the government backed the currency ensuring its value in gold.
There are many reasons why some currency is used and others are not. Some of it comes down to trust, some of it comes down to availability etc., etc. You’re making assumptions that don’t take the whole system of currency into consideration.
Part of the reason that people aren’t using Bitcoin is because it’s not widely accepted. You can’t walk to your corner store and buy a loaf of bread with bitcoin. This is the main reason people aren’t using it as currency: it has not been widely adopted or accepted as genuine currency, not because it’s supply is limited.

You said: 


My point is that your whole thought process on the value of bitcoin or other crypto’s is based on incorrect assumptions according to your responses. limiting supply was not a fatal error as you stated, whether anyone hoards or not.

Ripple is a company. XRP is a coin. Two different things.
