This is my article analyzing two views on what determines Bitcoin's consensus rules.
*Extreme Consensus* is the theory that Bitcoin’s properties can be relied on because of protocol immutability created through strong social consensus.
*Market Consensus* is the theory that Bitcoin’s properties are ultimately decided by investors, and protocol rules will be added or removed based on market support.

Why not announce that ShapeShift will accept bigger blocks *today*?
Let the miners know that you a prepared, and if they produce a longer proof-of-work chain with bigger blocks, that ShapeShift will follow that chain.

Good. So that means miners should not enforce the 1MB block size rule.

How do you propose preventing people from running competing consensus algorithms?

No malleability fix yet, but that is on the road map.
Another feature I didn't mention, is that the Bitcoin Cash sigh hash format allows [double-spend fraud proofs]( which have the potential the increase the safety of accepting unconfirmed transactions

FYI, Bitcoin Cash also has linear scaling of sighash operations and signing of input values.
This is because it uses a BIP-143 derived sighash format for its replay protection.
