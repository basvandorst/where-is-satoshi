Wait, so do you not have the original program to open the files in?

Why is this downvoted? This is actually a very decent write-up.

Assuming you can send to an address using the program, you'll want to use coinbase or some exchange (if you need help with that let me know). You can watch the market if you want and then sell when it's at a high, or you may just want to get out completely. Regardless, I'm really happy for you.

Hard to say. I figure it would depend on way too many variables. Which country is experiencing the recession? How much bitcoin does said country hold? How severe is said recession?

Regarding what, bitcoin?

Why do you suspect this is happening?

Just to be sure, you meant LTC as in Litecoin, right? I'm presuming your phone autocorrected to LTE haha. Anyway, I don't know anything about Quadriga. There aren't any exchanges (that I know of) that will let you trade LTC for anything but BTC and ETH. So, that being said, you'll have to pick an exchange, deposit your LTC, trade for BTC or ETH (really your choice, they're both climbing), and then use your BTC/ETH to trade for other cryptos.
Here are some exchanges:

It seemed that way at first but maybe you can find confidence in positive ratings/reviews. I bought some from some 20-something year old college student.

Hi. No, you don't have to take it off the website if you don't want to, but many people in the community would advise you do. I use a Trezor which is a hardware wallet (there are others); it can store many other crypto too.  It's a bit pricey but you may decide it is worth it.

Hahaha. I wonder if that ad is outdated or they are legit going for the full on scam. $10k in crypto a day? Not bad!
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:22:47
Are you looking to store it or trade with it? If you're looking to store/HODL then I would suggest a hardware wallet. If you wanna trade, just send it to an exchange.

Haha, yeah man I like to watch the market in my ride too.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:16:19
You can look around on  to try to find a seller and pay cash.

Whoever posted in here first is shadowbanned. Anyway, anyone who tells you they know is full of it. It's pure speculation. Some people might have more luck at reading the market but asking on here is about as lucky as asking someone on the street, no one knows.
BUT, since you want numbers, I'm gonna throw out it will drop $2k within a week. (Yes, that is a shitty, vague guess).

What do you mean "gone"? You have no recovery?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:03:14
Big if true

BUY WHEN IT'S AT AN ALL TIME HIGH
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:19:02
First purchase I made was via cash...tho the money was transferred to a coinbase account; however, you don't have to store your bitcoin on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:04:56
No problem. Good luck and happy trading!
