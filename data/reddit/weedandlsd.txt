I'll talk to a lawyer I guess. I don't know the numbers for % of tax evaders prosecuted, numbers probably are not there. I think it's a low risk, and I'd rather not have big brother steal my magic internet money gainz

@_date: 2016-07-09 17:21:22
If they do leave, the difficult level would adjust to profitable levels again. I'm not the smartest guy in this sub, but I'm guessing it's a game of chicken right now.
Also, they already have the hardware, as long as it's making more then it's spending in electricity, I don't see any reason not to keep them going.
