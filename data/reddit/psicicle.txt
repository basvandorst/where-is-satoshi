General search gets you a sqrt speedup only. Given how complicated SHA is, it seems unlikely that you'd get find an exponential speedup there.

Roughly speaking the birthday thing only brings down the time by a square root factor which doesn't make the problem much more tractable.

All your modifications will push up the odds of losing appropriately.
The simplest thing to do to prove your point is make the bets. Win that easy money.

If you follow this strategy you will likely be making exceedingly tiny amounts of btc anyway. So going by time constraints, you will be making orders of magnitude less money that a sweatshop worker. (It would require a 17+ streak to win a dollar, which has roughly a 1/100,000 chance of happening) If you raise the starting bet to something non-negligible, suddenly your chances of ruin become very real.
So, I wouldn't be concerned for the casino. If you like, you can waste your time winning thousandths of cents.
In the long run, it is provable that no betting strategy will give a positive expected value (via Martingale theory).

If you want to talk math, then read this:
Your only way around this is to bankrupt the casino.
If you don't have the prerequisite knowledge to understand this then maybe you shouldn't defer to the math. At the least, look under the first bullet of "applications"
The site is a straightforward example of a supermartingale.

To be fair, this game is better (and close to fully) understood through the theory of martingales (of which the basics can admittedly can be learned in a few concentrated weeks). It would be tough to go from basic probability to being able to prove that any gambling strategy will fail.
But I also agree with the sentiment that many mathematicians will underestimate the "abilities" of an engineer.
