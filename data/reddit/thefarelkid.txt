I haven't used GoogleDrive, but I have used other sync programs like rsync and have found that the TrueCrypt encryption won't be recognized as changed when syncing. You may find you need to manually upload it every time you change the data enclosed in the encryption. Unless GoogleDrive uses a different method than rsync to recognize changes.
tl:dr May have trouble keeping synced to GoogleDrive.

That makes sense.  Where do you get your bitcoins?

Yes please!

I was thinking of doing this same thing.  One last unknown though.  After all the fees, they give you BTC after taking a 3.99% fee right?  One problem though, they never state the exchange rate.  It's like going to the gas station and being told I will get some amount of gas less the % needed to pay gas taxes.  If the gas station only stated the tax rate, and not the price of gas, I would not want to buy.

Well, it looks like I've been giving you bad advice. The good news is I've found out how to solve an annoying problem I've been living with while syncing my TrueCrypt containers between machines.  [Here]( is information on how to make TrueCrypt update the timestamp.  Just remove the option "Preserve timestamps of file containers" and it should work like a charm.  My guess is that the timestamp won't be updated until the encryption is closed, but once closed, it should sync just fine.
Sorry for the confusion, boy do I look stupid.

Thanks for the advice, unfortunately that will definitely not fly.

Think about it like any other file in an encryption. You open the encryption, edit the file inside, then close the file and the encryption, and wait for it to sync. The inside file has changed size and the date stamp has as well. But the encryption hasn't changed size or date stamp. The sync program won't sync a file that doesn't give indication that it has changed.

Many thanks.

I find myself in the same position. And I don't want to pay 3.99% to go to Walmart, whatever that means. It seems the only way to get Bitcoins is to either pay high fees or get screwed on the exchange rate. Not what the inventors envisioned I am sure.

I think everyone is so happy that he didn't say "kill it with fire!" that they lost all ability to read and interpret a well written letter.
