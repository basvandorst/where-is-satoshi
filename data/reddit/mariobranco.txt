"What is racist about comparing your deal to Nigeria scam which is what it is literally called?"
Base on the fact that the user amatorfati type "Never sent money to Nigeria either." i say is not the most polite thing to say base on the fact that i'm here to sell Netflix for Bitcoin, why do even compare my deal to a scam base on no valid argument ? My question is can you prove that i'm here to scam or steal bitcoins ? Base on what ?

You are comparing buying Netflix accounts for bitcoin with "Nigerian scams involve offering you a share in a large sum of money on the condition you help them to transfer it out of their country"
And for your information is not call Nigeria Scam but advance-fee scam.

I'm just thinking this can help the bitcoin community.

Your comment is unnecessary for two reasons, first you're being rude and racist towards people in Nigeria and second you're saying that I'm going to fool people based on no valid argument.
