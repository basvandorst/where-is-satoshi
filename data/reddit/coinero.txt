**Market manipulation**. People lobbying for coinvalidation are usually millionaires that hold large amounts of *clean* btc. This guy wants to buy a shitload of coins from the FBI. Even if they were previously held by the silkroad, they're now *clean* and can be purchased legally.
Another huge proponent of coin validation is Yifu Guo, owner of Avalon. They were the first company to ship ASIC miners. He probably holds obscene amounts of freshly minted coins.
If coin validation gets adopted, blacklisted coins could become worthless, making their big stashes of clean coins more valuable.

You can swap the transformer on the bill acceptor unit for a 12v buck-boost DC-DC converter and the nexus7 charger for a 5v buck DC-DC one.
Then you can skip the inverter :)

Run your own server? Convince others to do the same?
Unsystem is making the software, the rest is up to us.

Yeah, EU companies have to pay *those* for you anyway. Cause everything for sale in Europe comes from Murica, right? So european companies must surely pay vat and customs there for everything, so why not buy straight from Murica? It's much cheaper! In fact, I don't know why you idiots even have shops in Europe, because all of them are paying customs, shippings and sales tax for you in our glorious country. 
**Forget european shops, buy straight from murica!!**

Spaniard here, the retroactivity part isn't true. That would be a major scandal.
