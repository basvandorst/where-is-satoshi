I am new to reddit there are a number of very good reasons I chose reddit for my upcoming/newest effort.  I am known in the Canadian media as the, "Thorn In The Side Outspoken Advocate For The Homeless"  I am going to take my efforts to the moon and back using crypto and reddit for a huge very modern approach to assisting the homeless.  I am in beginning stages and now focused on Doge for my project.  Google Jason McComb Homeless Awareness Canada to see some of my many past successful efforts.  My newest effort is going to reach New Zealand at the same time as Canada then everywhere between.  Details are coming with a new website soon.  Old twitter  new one for this 
My reddit is  any help would be so very much appreciated much thank you!

Nice play on words!  I do though wonder how many have actually become homeless from losing in bad crypto investments.  Just like the stock market and gambling and any other financial risk, the potential is very real.  Too many got in over their heads from FOMO and then went gung ho when they saw potentials if good investments were made however jumped in not knowing the basics.

Thank you for sharing this.  I am out of the loop I suppose from not watching television and paying little attention to current affairs in the media.

Unfortunately, like anything in the world it has become an addiction for many.  I know a couple of people that steal from friends and family, lie, cheat, steal and more in order to fund the obession.  Like everything in the world caution need be given when indulging/engaging.  It is as bad as gambling which is worse than drugs alcohol, and other addictions when weighed in comparison to costs.  You can only do so many drugs, consume so much alcohol but there is no end or limit to monetary usage, when it runs out loan, rob, cheat and steal options come in and worsen as the need for greed and recouping losses takes over until the inevitable destruction of even the strongest.

Best agreement ever made in an area of social media!  I rather enjoy the cut off rather than the seeming default reply that people use when someone such as myself in this case does not understand something.  Thank you for simply shaking your head and not bothering!  I much appreciate that truly!

Now I am very lost because I have no idea what being or not being Norwegian has to do with me not being up to date on these things and people.  I however did say I don't know what Brevik is or means that should be indicative that being as you now state/imply Brevik is a human, I am not aware of whom this Brevik is.

The only thing that has true "currency" is the measure of a human based on moral value but that too expires when the life of the human is no longer alive. Fiat, Crypto, ideas, and everything else that has no value past fanatical fulfillment in the mind of the person in possession and or desire for ownership of such things.  Just like a dream when the funeral of the night that possesses it the true "value" is something that is contained in what is done with the experience of having had it.

To most people here in Canada it is very early morning.  For my brain damaged ass that is all upside down and backwards it is middle of the night being awake going on 2 days "working" on a project.  I  am typically grumpy at this point but, you brought a reprieve from that just now, Much thank you!

Whether they do or not is irellevant in relation to what I said I believe.  I did stop watching television years ago.   I don't know what Brevik means but that may also be due to not watching television as well
