Right. Sentiment amonst HODLers I know is that even if something bad happens the bear market will likely not take nearly as long as Mt. Gox's. If you're in for the long haul, then selling at the verge of potential mass adoption is a bigger risk than dodging and profiting from the next bear cycle.

So accumulating capital to be able to make major investments years into the future becomes impossible. Everyone will be equally poor and miserable in a stagnant economy.
Free market forces make sure that those who are best able to allocate resources in productive enterprises are assigned more resources to allocate, enabling humanity to progress. Too many people think about money only in terms of "fairness", ignoring the meritocratic system that (sound) money in a free market is.
Most people are terrible at productively allocating resources/money, that's why markets don't give them much more than their own labour to allocate, within the confines that those who are able to allocate resources efficiently offer them. Of course the real world too often doesn't work that way because of corruption and violence, but that's not addressed with your idea of "fair" money.

@_date: 2017-02-15 19:42:57
You do realize that TV-sets are becoming better and older models become cheaper every year right? In terms of product prices, the overall technology market is extremely deflationary. Yet its performance is amazing, because due to the continously increasing purchasing power of consumers relative to these products. As money buys you more and better, the temptation to do so increases. The rational actor theory as used in economic theory is flawed because it considers money as an end instead of as a means of living a higher quality life, as most real people do.
When talking about the effects of deflation, it is vital to first consider its source; is it caused by 1) an increase in aggregate supply of products and services, 2) a decrease in aggregate demand of products and services, or 3) a contraction of the money (debt) supply? 
Number two and three are malign and together may form the dreaded deflationary spiral. The fiat monetary system is particularly vulnerable to it, because fiat money is debt money and it's built on fractional reserve banking. A default of a major debtor not only gives its direct creditors potential solvency issues, but if banks are involved (and they almost always are) also causes a direct contraction of the money/debt supply thanks to fractional reserve banking.
Bitcoin's natural state does not involve fractional reserve banking, and is thus not nearly as vulnerable to the deflationary spiral. Defaults of debtors don't directly contract the bitcoin supply as described above. A hypothetical Bitcoin economy would involve a lot less lending than our current economy and thus feature lower "growth", but in exchange we'd get far less severe boom-bust cycles and a more stable, sustainable economy.
@_date: 2017-02-15 21:04:04
You describe lending without using fractional reserves. The bank cannot loan more bitcoins to other parties than you (and others) deposited. They could issue their own "bitcoin credit" in excess, but that would essentially be a different coin and not be considered the real thing by the bitcoin network, and thus not as useful and valuable due to counterparty risk.
This creates for the public a clear difference between digital money as a scarce asset and digital money as credit with a risk attached.
@_date: 2017-02-16 16:51:12
We're not contradicting each other. The result in your last paragraph is that there is a claim of 1.9 BTC on 1 real BTC. They've effectively increased the amount of money in circulation, or at least IF the bank credit would be viewed by the public as being actual money. Our fiat monetary systems treat bank credit as money, while the core Bitcoin network would never treat bank credit denominated in bitcoin as actual bitcoin.

Author paints a scenario in which there'd be no hardcoded block size limit. With the 1 MB restriction in place, the blockchain can't grow more than a little over 50 GB per year (6 * 24 * 365 = 52560 MB).
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:46:34
A hard fork to 2 MB only seems a compromise to those who already have a moderate position. To BU, a successful 2 MB hardfork orchestrated by Core is just a consolidation of their leadership in Bitcoin development, and would kill BU's momentum. To them, it'll just mean they'll have to completely start over several years from now for the next leg up. They don't want that, they want to remove Core's influence on the blocksize. That's what BU has become about to most. You can be assured they'd try to disrupt a 2MB hardfork, maybe even plan their own at or near the same moment.
I agree that a contentious hardfork would be bad, but I don't think it will happen because Jihan Wu from Bitmain is not an idiot. I believe that the reason he feints support for BU is to avoid activation of a malleabiliy fix which would allow considerable off-chain scaling, which is not in his interest in terms of revenue and power. He doesn't want an actual BU hardfork either.
@_date: 2017-03-31 14:58:32
I expect a status quo for the coming year, odds that segwit won't get activated by november are high. I don't see a BU fork happening any time soon, I'd sooner expect that Classic fork plan from Olivier.
Some day we'll get segwit, but it may take years. The landscape first has to change. The august UASF plan won't get enough support in time I expect, it'll seem too hasty and thus too risky, but the support for segwit in general is there, so a 2018 flag day activation is possible.
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:27:05
Bitcoin Uncore
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:14:56
I agree. There is barely any support from exchanges for BU even as an altcoin in it's current state (without reorg and replay protection), the vast majority of non-mining nodes run Core, the threats of attacking the original chain makes BU'ers look like terrorists, and as Luke argued, signalling for BU doesn't necessarily mean anything if it's from coercion from Jihan.
And even if we have to fork to change mining difficulty or PoW to preserve the main chain, it will quickly get us SegWit, Lightning + Schnorr + MAST, which are *actual* scaling solutions and would make the BU chain look like a dinosaur. If you're not in a hurry to cash out, you can hodl through this without a worry.
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:11:45
How quickly? How much will fees drop shortly after a malleability fix due to off-chain scaling, and how long will it take before increase in demand will push them to previous levels? Could be quite a while, none really knows. If you're on a tight margin, the prospect of this taking many months or perhaps years is a threat. Maybe some miners need steadily increasing fees right now to be able to break even.

No it isn't. On the contrary, it will only consolidate it. Sometimes a power balance needs to be tested and its consequences demonstrated before the world before it's widely acknowledged. If Bitcoin needs a PoW change some day, it will most likely be the last one it ever needs. No miner thereafter will even dare to dream about attacking the chain supported by the best devs and the most users.
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:26:52
Not really. Lower fees are nice, but Bitcoin is about autonomy instead of authority.
@_date: 2017-03-24 09:52:21
It's idiotic to subject a public good like the blocksize to the free market, since the burden of the size of a block isn't carried by the miner who produces it but by all nodes in the network. This is like saying that the level of environmental polution should be regulated by the factories causing it.
BU'ers argue that the factories will produce more goods (transactions in this case) if you let them regulate polution, while completely ignoring that over time it'll destruct the environment for everyone else.

The problem has never been a slight increase in capacity. The problem has always been the method. Hard forks should be a measure of last resort, and be planned very long in advance. It's insanity to do a hard fork if it's not strictly necessary. And it isn't for the time being, as SegWit opens the way to capacity increases through multiple optimisations.
This is only a compromise to reckless hard-fork fans, not to conservative Bitcoiners who acknowledge the risks associated with hard forks.

Public goods can be local. A factory could poison the local lake that is being used as a water source by the local residents. Those residents are the "users". Saying it's okay to poison the lake because the local residents can move elsewhere is immoral, just like BU plans to kill the original chain after their poisonous hard fork are immoral.

This is the **most important** part of the entire amendment. They can follow whatever chain they like "in good faith". 
Now consider that since the original chain would be compatible with a hypothetical BU hard fork, and thus the BU fork could be orphaned in it's entirety if the original chain ever gets more proof of work, you can bet they won't support a controversial BU hard fork. They'd be insane to take that risk. And if the ETF is going to be as popular as most people think it'll be, their decision to not follow BU would spell it's doom immediately.

Exactly, whether a lightning router is profitable depends on if they can collect enough fees before they have to close or open a new channel to rebalance the channel. So it stands to reason the fee is proportional to the imbalance you cause to their channel, and sending higher amounts cause more imbalance.
@_date: 2019-02-25 08:03:05
"Just to settle" means you've likely batched a whole lot of transactions together, so it's perfectly fine to be relatively expensive. One on-chain transaction costing 10 USD in fees is perfectly fine if the average channel processes thousands of transactions.

Yes if people stop using Bitcoin then Bitcoin won't matter anymore. The point is that as long as bitcoin credit can be redeemed for bitcoin, they can't issue overly much credit before completely losing the credibility of solvency. At that point actors would definitely start a "bank run". I don't just mean regular people here, I'm talking about states and oligarchs. Abolition of such a "Bitcoin standard" would be alot harder than the abolition of the gold standard of the previous century, since usage of Bitcoin has far less friction than the usage of gold. It's a lot harder to persuade your counterparties to give it up and accept the limitless credit instead.

No they wouldn't, since they'd be perfectly valid blocks. Such censorship would simply entail re-orging the blocks of any other miners that contain transaction from blacklisted addresses. Our only answer would be doing a POW algorithm change, which is pretty much a nuclear option.
@_date: 2019-12-28 13:04:03
Such single points of failure will be hacked and banks will fall. They can create Bitcoin credit in intra-bank networks, but the Bitcoin network will never recognize such credit as real bitcoin. It introduces real limits to fractional reserve banking, more so than a gold standard. In times of crisis banks from other jurisdictions at least will demand real bitcoin and won't accept credit.
But yeah, a large part of the population will choose the cage of convenience. Bitcoin can offer freedom, but it can't impose it on those who prefer servitude. Most people don't want freedom, they want a fair master.
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:26:29


When censoring a particular address you don't need to rewrite the entire blockchain, you only have to rewrite the latest block when a transaction from that address is included in it. Sure, in the meantime the minority hashpower may get lucky and mine another block on top of the latest, but if you have more hashpower you will catch up and pass them by sooner rather than later. Then the minority miners get nothing, and the attackers still get their BTC rewards as usual. If the minority miners figure out what's going on, it's in their selfish interest to start censoring that address as well to prevent their blocks from being reorged by the majority group.
Really, the only cost for miners here is in the backlash from the public when Bitcoin isn't censorship resistant anymore. That should cause a price crash and at least one POW fork. But the Chinese government may very well not give a shit about that and be willing to sacrifice the mining companies, or even partially reimburse them, just to give Bitcoin's reputation and community a very hard blow. For them the game is not about earning money, it's about creating and controlling money.
I'm not saying this is going to happen, just that it's not unthinkable. I have BTC myself, so I'm betting it won't. I think most governments don't consider Bitcoin a serious threat so far, believing that they can contain it well enough with surveillance at exchanges, and that its volatility makes it unsuitable as a fiat replacement (which is true for the time being).
@_date: 2019-12-18 13:25:17


Censoring isn't the same as double spending, and if using existing mining farms it wouldn't cost them anything up until the public's reaction to the reorgs.
While I would support a POW change in this case, it makes us very vulnerable to attack. A coordinated government attack could overwhelm honest hashing power in the early stages. More than that, the wider community would become susceptible to social attacks, like sowing discord about which new POW algorithm should be chosen and whether the opportunity should be taken to make other changes to the algorithm. We could end up with multiple forks without general consensus which one is now "Bitcoin".

The break-even point of profitability. If demand for energy significantly rises due to Bitcoin, energy prices will go up and mining becomes less profitable. Supply and demand will find a proper equilibrium. Bitcoin will only consume all the energy we produce when everyone agrees that nothing that requires energy has value other than Bitcoin. That will obviously never happen.

He means he won't start signalling segwit despite a UASF rejecting non-segwit signalling blocks. If the UASF doesn't have a miner majority then the UASF will be the minority chain, and all UASF nodes will fork themselves off. That's why he's calling it a UAHF.
UASF will only work well if it either has many exchanges and such backing it, or even better if it has a majority mining power. Without that it's a bluff, and Jihan is calling it.

I don't think it is possible even with Taproot or Mast. Once you have the private key(s), you can just repeat what you did and verify the same outcome.
I haven't looked at all the details of Mast, but if it's standard practice in implementations to add a random dummy spending condition that's immediately discarded after creation of the smart contract, then attackers can't expect you to be able to proof there are no hidden conditions that circumvent the HTLC. They can still kill you I suppose, but then they need to be sure you haven't added a hidden condition and gave it to someone else (or automated it's use) in case of your death/kidnapping (or general absence in the case of a bot).
The uncertainty would always be there, and could function as a general deterrent at least against sophisticated attackers who realize this.
I think the best guardians of additional multisig keys are psychopaths that have build a business model on their reputation of not releasing those keys even when you are tortured. When you're a customer there that reputation functions as a deterrent. If they give in even once, their business collapses. I guess there is a future for bankers after all!

Difficulty will just go up to compensate, and the cost of mining might transfer partially from energy costs to silicon costs. Either way, total mining costs will always gravitate towards parity with mining rewards. There is no free lunch, and that's the entire point. We have PoW to make it costly to make false blocks.

Core devs aren't in control, people choose voluntarily to run their software because so far they've been making sound decisions and have provided top quality software.
The difference between following Core or this group of miners is that when you follow Core's vision you will still have the choice to stop following them in the future, while if you follow the miner's vision you essentially give up that choice because later you probably won't be able to afford to run your own node anymore and so essentially have given up your financial self-sovereignty!

Not needlessly at all, since most of the blockchains peddled nowadays by "blockchain companies" have no better immutability than a regular database protected by a firewall. Using hashes as pointers and replicating data does not result in immutability.

It's an individual decision to run one consensus rule set or the other, not a majority decision. Within a rule set proof of work is used to determine the order of the transactions.

I think we're still learning, refining the protocols we use for developing and deploying upgrades. This scaling "debate" has taught us much, we're going to do better in the future.
I'm fine with Bitcoin being overtaken by market cap, as long as Bitcoin itself is the most reliable and stable on the long term. We have the store of value niche, it's hard to take that away with new fancy features. Let other (side) chains try out new controversial features first, if we REALLY need them they'll adopted eventually.
Besides, once lightning network is ubiquitous in crypto we get secure atomic swaps between all chains. This whole ecosystem will become one giant internet of value. If swapping Bitcoin for other utility tokens becomes practically frictionless, what's the point of hodling such tokens?

If BIP148 completely fails or succeeds, you will hardly notice. If it's a stand off for a longer period of time, there will essentially be two different versions of Bitcoin.
If your coins are in the hands of third party service that's not prepared for BIP148 then they might be at risk. Withdraw them to a wallet fully under your control or just sell before the first of august and wait.

@_date: 2017-05-28 07:34:10
There might not be a split, or only a very short one. If the SegWit chain gets more proof of work than the old one then the old one will essentially disappear. This very fact may very well make it a selffulfilling prophecy, since the risk of dealing in "old" coins will likely make its price crash. Once SegWit coins are of higher value than "old" coins, BIP148 is an inevitable success.
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:39:48
No, this is retarded. They are redeploying segwit and will definitely cause a chain split. 4 months is way too short to both prepare a hardfork and a new segwit deployment.

Right, that's why I'm quite happy that Alex Petrov from Bitfury said he'll support BIP148 if SegWit hasn't actived come august. If they stick to that I think it has a real chance of succeeding, if not, then it's probably dead on arrival.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:59:47
The reason why they don't want the existing deployment is because they want to force the hard fork  by bundling it with SegWit. Of course, there's nothing stopping anyone from taking the code of the new segwit and adjusting it to turn off the hard fork and then distributing that to the rest of us.
In the unlikely event that BIP148 is dead on arrival, I will surely be using such a modified client. I'm not against a hard fork per se, but a highly contentious one that is forced on us by special interest groups holding SegWit hostage? Never!
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:08:15

@_date: 2017-05-23 16:25:53


I do not. I'm leaning Greg's side on this one, I would prefer BIP149 but will support BIP148 for now. But if BIP148 fails I'd prefer status quo over PoW change. A PoW change would hand over the Bitcoin brand to the corpocracy. I'd much rather stay and help affect immutability of the protocol.
I've seen you call for a PoW change before, but there was and is hardly any support for it. I am worried that you see a BIP148 failure as an opportunity to gather a following to initiate one after all. I'm skeptical concerning the long term succes of what would essentially be an altcoin.

It really isn't likely, all that talk is cheap. There's a very strong economic incentive for all actors involved to not let the chain split.

There's no way to know how much miner support it would've had when the date arrived. There are strong incentives for miners in waiting until the last moment to decide what to do in such a situation.
Fact is that the NYA group took it serious enough to make sure segwit activated before the UASF date. So UASF has had a real impact on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:32:25
You guys are like Ents repeating "Don't be hasty!" while a war is raging around you. Bitcoin, or rather Bitcoin development, is under a massive social engineering attack.
We cannot risk FrankenSegwit succeeding, it sets a terrible precedent for Bitcoin development where special interest groups hold widely desired upgrades hostage. But more "moderate" people are likely to go along with it, because they are fat up with this "debate" and want this resolved.
I actually expect there will be a permanent chain split due to BIP148. Yet I still prefer this over a "successful" simultaneous 2MB+SegWit deployment that Jihan et al. wants. (Which also results in a chain split)
I urge all Core devs to wake up and put the punk in cypherpunk like Luke Dashjr and Eric Lombrozo did. Do you believe Jihan will sit still while we wait for BIP149? He will stir up more and more shit, and will attempt to derail BIP149 as well. The Silbert "agreement" shows how many parties are getting desperate for a solution.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:30:25
I don't think I'm going to support BIP148 because I think BIP149 is safer and will have more support from major players. With BIP148 we users would initiate a chain split, but with BIP149 that step lies with the miners.
It sucks that BIP149 will take longer, but at this point BIP148 feels overly rushed and will likely fail. Unless we soon hear of multiple major economic players (exchanges etc.) supporting it, we should set our eyes on BIP149.
@_date: 2017-05-03 16:30:10

I can understand waiting for more review so we can be more confident that the math and the code is safe before activation, but taking years to come up with more reasons why they'd be great sounds like a giant waste of time.
As for more support from other software like wallets, it's not very motivating to put a lot of effort into supporting this new tech if you're not even sure when, if ever, it gets activated on the main chain. For profit-driven businesses it would make no sense at all.
Hopefully other chains will activate and start using it sooner so we'll get it into Bitcoin before 2030.

If the BIP148 chain makes it to the next difficulty adjustment (which is less than a full period in this case!) then it's a success. With that I mean that by then it's very unlikely to die and very likely to reorg the legacy chain before long. Those morbidly opposed may hard fork, but by any objective measure they would then lose the right to the Bitcoin brand. All existing clients would recognize the Segwit chain as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:25:01

@_date: 2017-05-29 20:46:28
The ecosystem is on edge, I don't believe anymore that BIP148 is too fast. People need deadlines to get moving. Segwit itself has been widely adopted already, so once the Segwit chain becomes longer all those clients are compatible already.
Doing nothing is the riskier option here, BIP148 *will* be attempted by a significant part of the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2019-05-07 11:19:36


Mining majority enforcing matters because when a mining minority violates a new rule, that chain will simply be reorged at some point. What you say in these lines presents this from the perspective of a node deploying a new ruleset, I was coming from a more general point of view.


Which in practice will never happen with an update like this in any reasonable amount of time. What I said wasn't confused, merely practical and short. If we don't want to risk a chain split, we require an enforcing mining majority.

You do if you want not-upgraded nodes to follow your new ruleset chain, which is the main reason to do a soft rather than hard fork in the first place.
It seems I'm getting shit here because people interpret my statement in the context of what happened with the UASF and the discussion around the role of miners. Well, I actually supported UASF, so I am NOT saying that miners are in charge of the rules. Economically relevant full nodes are, but when you do a softfork and don't want a chain split between old and new nodes a mining majority enforcing the new ruleset is absolutely vital.
