Because the criminal could be a big tough thug who would hit and punch you and take your phone before it locked.
If you are of small stature you could say "STOP THIEF" and pull out your gun, and be in the right legally.
This equalizes things between smaller people and bullies. I fully believe I should be able to protect myself and my money!

Mine bricked when I first bought it. Tech support was useless and cared more about generating bland responses in a timely manner to maintain ticket status than with actually helping with resolution

Wonder if they define government recursively*, and if so, if we can make a good case for being a nation run by our dictators hugolp and theymos?
*go to google and define government: The governing body of a *nation*, state, or community.
define nation: A large aggregate of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular *country* or territory.
define country: A nation with its own *government*, occupying a particular territory.
Well that settles it, right? We inhabit r/bitcoin, share a culture and language, and have two benevolent leaders.

Interesting... seems like this type of problem was sorted out *somewhat* by being able to assign your own transaction fee to validating your blocks?

"As long as there is a means of converting bitcoins into real money, criminal actors will have an incentive to steal them."
Does it makes sense they wouldn't steal them and only use them to purchase goods and services.

Huge computational resources being improperly allocated. If I schedule a transaction of .1 btc it normally takes the same amount of time/resources to solve it as a 100 btc transaction right? So the 100 btc guy can choose to pay the person who solves his any amount of bitcoins, so they can be prioritized according to choice.

I get your point, but the lack of a "victim" in the term "victimless crime" is referring to everybody EXCEPT the perpetrator. I may lose a lot of money illegally gambling, but I can't be considered a victim. 
The junkie becoming a horrendous monster may be a sad circumstance, but it was his risk and his choice, just like fast food and sky diving.

I gotta be honest, I know what very little of that means. Dumb it down a bit for the basic users here?

In short: "Victimless activity that we used to be able to overlook because only the poor had access is now becoming far more accessible to the average citizen. Rather than examining whether the policies that prohibit victimless crime are reasonable in the first place, we have decided to greatly increase our expenditure to enforce compliance. Also, you're going to be hearing the term 'e-crime' a lot more."

Yeah, considering how much inflation there is currently with the usd, btc price could remain stable, and still soon be trading at 20 usd.

Well, it sounds like what you might really be asking is, "is there any way I can make the same amount of profit from mining as I used to", and the answer is no. To understand the bitcoin and current bubbles, you have to know a bit about libertarian (Austrian) economics. The currency had a lot of speculation behind it, which artificially inflated the price. A lot of people mistook bitcoin mining as a form of free money, not realizing mining coins, exactly like mining gold, has a limited amount of use and wont be profitable forever.

I would love to see more memes on this subreddit. I'm subscribed and it's on the front page for me. If I'm looking to read another idiot-news article about *MYSTERIOUS NAKAMOTO MAKES NEW HACKER DOLLARS* I'll go find it. I would rather see a fun joke or image related to one of my interests made by people who understand it than some idiotic fluff piece.

When they weren’t busy mining, the faithful tried to solve the mystery of the man they called simply Satoshi.... On December 5, 2010, after bitcoiners started to call for Wikileaks to accept bitcoin donations, the normally terse and all-business Nakamoto weighed in with uncharacteristic vehemence. “No, don’t ‘bring it on,’” he wrote in a post to the bitcoin forum. “The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to Wikileaks not to try to use bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.”
For as much as he knows about technology and anonymity, I question Satoshi's knowledge of human nature.
Creating a secret anonymous alias with a mysterious history doesn't seem to fit well with his "let's keep this low-key" mentality. Unless he actually is Julian Assange or something, he'd probably be better off not trying to be a faceless Atlas. I don't know if I can think of a BETTER way to draw attention.

"Bitcoin? That's kind of like WoW gold right?"
"Hey kid why don't you take your little "electric drug pennies" and go back to your mom's basement?"
No I didn't actually read any comments.

Its more than the headline. They ask a few questions then say "Find out below "
 in the first paragraph. I stopped reading there...

"The problem with your little 'drug-pennies' is they are unstable and vulnerable to booms and busts. You don't see those problems with FIAT currency, now do you?"

In my opinion, the first company that starts sponsoring bitcoin is going to be the first company to face backlash. It's like with napster, banks and governments are going to start lobbying for ways to "ban" it that will all hopefully be ineffective.

"Centralized inspection process... The quantity of coins is limited and supervised by a central agency..." IMMEDIATELY followed by "above all, the system is decentralized." Did he even edit this?? We need to just start explaining to people that a MYSTERIOUS ANONYMOUS ANARCHIST HACKER makes bitcoins on his supercomputer then gives them out on a lottery system.

So a while back I heard there's some new US law that's going to interfere w/ bitcoin. Is that going to affect bitcointip in any way?
@_date: 2013-06-06 08:44:40
One concept I've kind of liked is that defense organizations, since they have limited funds (payments not taxes) would prefer non-violent conflict, as it was less expensive.
IE: instead of warfare, they would have contracts and specializations (one agency focuses on warranted searches of homes, one focuses on being judges, one on cryptographic protection of bank accts etc.)
What do you think of that idea?
@_date: 2013-06-06 08:57:05
I don't think anybody is hating the founding fathers and the constitution and/or the concept of individual rights. They're hating the constant wars and perceived intrusion on other country's business.

would you mind elaborating on this point? I've shared your answer with many friends and they ask about this and I draw a blank.

I'm gonna quote from Robert Murphy's "Chaos Theory", the article that changed my mind. Tell me what you think: (PS the whole PDF is less than 80 pages and free at[library.mises.org/books/Robert P Murphy/Chaos Theory.pdf]
Critics often dismiss private law by alleging that disputes between
enforcement agencies would lead to combat—even though this
happens between governments all the time! In truth, the incentives
for peaceful resolution of disputes would be far greater in market
anarchy than the present system. Combat is very expensive, and
private companies take much better care of their assets than govern
ment officials take care of their subjects’ lives and property.
In any event, those engaging in “warfare” in a free society would
be treated as any other murderers. Unlike government soldiers,
private mercenaries would receive no special privileges to engage
in condoned violence. Those agencies interpreting the law would
not be the same as the firms enforcing it. There is no intrinsic  reason to worry about battles between private enforcement agencies,
any more than battles between the government army and navy.
(section omitted)
“Your insurance companies would become the State!”
(Earlier he sets a framework of insurance companies which is brilliant but lengthy. If you care to, please explore)
on the contrary, the private companies providing legal services
would have far less power under market anarchy than the government currently possesses. Most obvious, there would be no power to tax or to monopolize “service.” If a particular insurance company
were reluctant to pay legitimate claims, this would become quickly 
known, and people would take this into account when dealing with
clients of this disreputable firm.
The fear that (under market anarchy) private individuals would
replace politicians, overlooks the true causes of
state mischief.
Unlike feudal monarchs, democratic rulers don’t actually
own the resources (including human) that they control. Furthermore,
the duration of their rule (and hence control of these resources) is
very uncertain. For these reasons, politicians and other government
employees do not exercise much care in maintaining the (market)
value of the property in their jurisdiction.
shareholders of a private company, however, have every interest in choosing personnel and policies to maximize the profitability of the firm.
All the horrors of the State—onerous taxation, police brutality,
total war—are not only monstrous, but they’re also grossly
inefficient. It would never be profitable for anarchist insurance and legal firms to mimic the policies set by governments.
The main problem with implementing an objectivist government I've always seen is that the system we have now relies on democracy. This system seems to cleverly sidestep that issue.

But you're not, you're subscribed to r/bitcoin.
It's easy to see you're an ancap and an atheist: are you subscribed to r/atheism? 
"looked it up" can mean a lot of things can't it? It could mean he's done hours of research poring through for a new liberty and then reading supplementary stuff like "chaos theory" and other articles, or it could means he's read a couple basic arguments and thought of a couple decent responses, and is using that as fuel to stimulate a conversation (but yes it sounds dismissive, so what?).
It's not on *either* of you to humble yourself before the other and ask for knowledge. Nobody is burdened with proof as the only currency here is "karma". Why not summarize an argument, wait for a rebuttal, then throw out data you have to back it up?
