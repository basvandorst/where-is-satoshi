They take debit cards.

I'm no expert but it is no where near as volatile as it was 3 years ago. It's been pretty consistent the last 2 years. But bitcoin is just the beginning. Cryptocurrencies aren't going anywhere no time soon.

Spot on. Last time it reached 1000 I cashed out so fast. Never had that much money in my life. And Coinbase was new at the time which made it so easy. Wasted all of it on nonsense. This time around I'm holding on like a pitbull.

Coinbase is cuurently the easiest way to sell and one of the least secure ways to keep your bitcoins. I use them to buy and sell small amounts

Coinbase is still the easiest atm. Yea it takes a month to get fully verified but after that you can buy up to 50 btc everyday instantly from your bank account. Selling back is also quite easy. Coinbase quotes 2 days for your money to arrive but I've always received it in just 1 and selling only requires basic bank verification. During this last spike I made out pretty easy while others were scrambling to sell. Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.

I'd still live a modest life.

I'll be moving back there soon. That would be the perfect place to have some meet ups. Can't wait!
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:13:27
I just moved 3.6

No but I changed my password while they logged in also. My bank will only block the ip for a while but not indefinitely so I wouldn't have known.

Definitely coinbase atm. It takes me one day to transfer to my bank account.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:39:32
In full buy mode right now.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:57:26
Coinbase is back up :D
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:33:24
Sold at 540 bought in at 614. I will never try and speculate again

You have to be verified with coinbase to buy instantly thought your bank account. This process takes over a month. Until you are a verified customer it takes about 3-7 days to complete one purchase on coinbase. Prices could fall or raise in that time frame so it's really up to you but it is a gamble. I foresee a large surge coming to coinbase in the next month or so so there may be some delay with some getting verified. I still have over two weeks before I am a verified.

That was from 8 months ago. I have since used coinbase multiple times and the money arrives in my account NLT 2 days. All of my orders have been honored and I recently liquidated most of my btc when prices reached 200 and I've already received the money from that. Coinbase has legit investors and a respectable volume of btc. It's not a fraud.

This is regular with coinbase. Usually takes 6 days to complete the transaction. If you go to your account transactions page it should tell you when your btc will arrive. No need to panic

Personally I use BlockChain and Coinbase. There's been a lot of complaints lately about coinbase but I haven't had any problems. Be careful with mobile wallets. They can cause your monthly data usage to skyrocket if you leave them running
@_date: 2013-10-30 08:24:48
I've been level 2 for a month now. You have to wait 30 days after your first completed purchase.
