Would UPS have cc info that amazon used from me?

They always have.

Seriously, other than the fact that it takes a week to get your money, I haven't really had an issue.

They added their already successful social media website to YouTube allowing you to easily cross-post and a bunch of whiny tools got all pissy about it.
NOT the same thing as screwing up their core "search" feature for adult content.

lol, I love it.  Republicans love their money and the ability to prop up the wealthy and the banks.  But ask a Republican who the most money-hungry and opposed to change when it comes to money is and they'll tell you the Democrats, those greedy bastards, are to blame for all financial ills and are just rich fat cats.

Honestly there is no reason to switch because of this.  Just middle click all the suggested searches on something, close all but one, and repeat until you've done 30 searches for the 15 max a day.  You can knock this out in minutes.  Doesn't have to be "natural" searching.

If you give permission to Google to do the spying on you that they already do you can get 8 bucks in the first week and 2 bucks every week after that from Google for installing Screenwise Trends.

I get why Google messed up porn, to make it harder to "accidentally" find it.  What I don't get is why they don't realize how bad they've screwed it up and why they haven't reversed course.

Do Bing Rewards.  Get enough to cash out in PayPal.  Buy Bitcoin from Coinbase.

Hmm, MS doesn't have anything like Google Wallet, does it?  Makes sense that they don't see any competition from BTC whereas Google does.
Still, I get a passive 2 bucks a week from Google for Screenwise Trends, with Bing I have to do 50 searches a day to not even get a dollars worth of points. ;)

Neither side led me to porn.

What does this have to do with Bitcoin?  This issue makes a debit or credit card tied to a bank account on the same playing field as Bitcoin if we are talking just about their safety relevant to civil forfeiture.

I won about 20 dollars worth of Bitcoin and it's all in my wallet on PC.  IDGAF.

If I were asked which cryptocurrency will survive and thrive based on how MATURE and RESPECTFUL the community was I would say dogecoin in a heartbeat!  I am not a fan of the doge meme, but it is blindingly obvious that this community beats out other crypto currencies and then some.

If he has to report his tips at the end of the nighht it might be not in his best interest to take a currency that would confused random middle management.
