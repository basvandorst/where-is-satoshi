Are you really venezuelan? No Electric supply? Lol
@_date: 2018-06-28 16:39:54
It already exist. It's clearnet and it's called el petrolero. However, instead of helping each other, people offer the products for 10x+ the price ;) 100%capitalism... Lol

Nah dude, capitalism is great! That's why everyone applies it there in Venezuela... The only thing socialist about it is the name of Maduro's party ;-)

Imagine that BTC keeps stable at 100$ during one week. You live in a country where you pay 10 Units for each dollar, this means that during that week, 1 BTC would cost 1000 Units: If BTC keeps stable but suddenly you start paying 1500 Units, that is because the Unit dropped and now you are paying 15 Units per dollar.
Now imagine that the exchange rate shown by the indicators is 15 Units/USD, but on local Bitcoins people are willing to pay 20 Units per BTC even though the real price should be 15 Units per BTC...That is what happened.

Sell half... Invest in gold and in other goods you can sell for a good price in your local currency

Wow man... How much do you pay for the light, Internet and other services? 
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:39:27
And BTW. The most beautiful thing about capitalism is competition, not humanism... And in Venezuela, people just compete with each other trying to get the most profit out of others... So I'd say it's pretty much capitalism and free market ;) you know, less availability means more expensive products...

Dude calm down! It should be like 3am over there... I am only mocking you, not the por people... When was the last time you ate? Can u plz tell me? Out of curiosity ;) and you do remember the whole "babies are dying"... Right? You were super Ver on that!!!! 
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:21:42
So, electricity should be 0.001$ a day or a month?
And Internet is at 0.006$ a month?
Mmm what about public transportation for a month? Gas,Health, education, taxes...?
That's pretty interesting... 0.006$ is like... dunnl, 1second of Internet here =0
Maybe other thing must unaffordable since Venezuela doesn't produce almost anything but oil... Why not just import them?
That's pretty messed up
@_date: 2018-06-01 13:38:10
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:27:01
Nope... That's not what free market means ;-) 
@_date: 2018-06-01 06:03:51
Dude... Are you sure you are from Venezuela?... Entire cities without power for weeks? Looool..! Yeah... It's funny how easy it is to lie over here... It is like when Roger ver said babies were dying because of bitcoin, remember..? ;-) well... Hope you can eat tomorrow and there is no black out so you can keep on redditing! C ya

I'd argue it's easier to buy drugs with physical cash than it is to with bitcoin

Hey man! I'm the one who wrote it!
Well, actually i did research a lot and use crypto on a daily basis... It's hard to make the perfect list!
Just as an example, you say Trezor is good, but a guy said Trezor paid me to put their wallet instead of the brand new Ledger Nano X...
It is a pretty subjective list and i was thinking about the everyday user who wants to put some money into crypto.
Some people don't like BitPay because Roger Ver is involved, or they don't support segwit, etc.. but for a normal user that is not something they would consider. The same goes for other wallets
Other wallets like Trust, Wasabi, Samourai, Bitcoin core, etc are great too. but it's hard to make a list with only 5!
Which wallets would you think would make a better list?
@_date: 2019-08-09 22:02:14
;) well, i don't think that's always the case... i'm always switching wallets, android roms, linux distros etc, pc components, etc...  
its more because i'm curious and not because there is something wrong :)
also... after years of using crypto, i think i can say there is not a perfect wallet, a perfect exchange or even a perfect blockchain!

For my Spanish speaking crypto fellows. 
Here's a Spanish translation in the format of a rap, for you to follow along what they both are saying ��
