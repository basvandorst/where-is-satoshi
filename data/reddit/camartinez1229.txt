Citi Double Cash has worked very well for me.

I'd recommend looking at Bitstamp.net. Their fees, though slightly higher than Coinbase's, look to be lower than Bitcoin.com's. Plus, their limits are more generous than Coinbase (unless you can already charge $5k or more a week). Finally, with Bitstamp, you avoid giving any business to a tool propping up a hostile fork of Bitcoin (BCH).

That sucks. I'm sorry. Well, if you have an AMEX card, you could give the [Abra]( app a try, but limits will be really low--$200 a day and $1000 a month.

Bitstamp could be a good one. You'd probably have to wait a few weeks to get verified, though.

Yes, just not by using credit cards, though.

Honestly, you're going to have a hard time finding anyone or any service that sells Bitcoins via CC, as CC transactions are so easily charged back, leaving sellers out their money and coins.

Coinbase allows me to enter in purchase amounts less than 0.1? I've never tried to execute a purchase for an amount that low, though. Have you?

You could also check your ABP settings. It could be that it's set to whitelist Google? You also might have to subscribe to an additional filtering list--I'm not sure. I haven't looked back on ABP ever since I switched to UBlock a few years ago.

This looks interesting! I might give it a try later. For now, though, I just thought I'd point out that if .NET Framework 4.6 is a requirement, then there's no way Windows XP could be supported as claimed? .NET Framework 4.5+ dropped support for XP. Not that anyone should be running XP or Vista anymore, haha, but just thought I'd mention it.

That's unfortunate. But at least since it was charged to your card, you have a chance of getting the money back, right?
If you still wish to use GDAX in the future, bookmark the URL gdax.com. I'd also recommend installing an adblocker such as [UBlock Origin]( that would block the Adwords links from displaying, since probably most of them are scams or junk anyway.

Check out the [Abra]( app. You can buy Bitcoin with AMEX on there, and your Serve card should work too. From 


Visa and MasterCard have started hitting CC crypto buys with cash advance fees, however. I'm not sure if AMEX would be subject to those fees as well. Serve shouldn't, though, since it's a prepaid debit.

Bittrex, Binance, Coinexchange.io, Cryptopia, Coinbase, and Bitstamp, are places I can think of off the top of my head that let you convert BCH to BTC. If you're looking to sell it for fiat, then Coinbase might be your best bet. I'm pretty sure you'd have to verify your identity before you can sell for fiat, though. If you're outside of the USA, however, I'm less sure of how well Coinbase would work for you (if at all).
You can see all of BCH's major markets at

Do you still need help with this? If so, I think I can help. How far did you get with the tutorial?

Check out r/FuckToken/! Their tip bot is coming out on September 18, and is currently in beta testing.

Did you contact Paxful's support? If you have that evidence from Steam that the code was redeemed the very minute you gave it out, Paxful might be able to force release of the BTC owed to you? I'm not too sure, though. Such foolishness on his part, though, scamming for a lousy $50. I'm sorry. I hope you get this resolved in your favor.

You can send your BTC to [GDAX]( (Coinbase's backend exchange), and from there, you can continue handing out BTC to friends for free. GDAX doesn't charge a fee for withdrawals.

Maybe you could try a different wallet software, or a mobile wallet app, and try to input your wallet using the seed words or private key?  might be a good starting place.
Is this the software you've been using?  If so, that's been discontinued. So, maybe all you need to do is input your data into another wallet like I suggested above.
Maybe someone with more Mac experience than I can chime in. Whatever you do, though, do not give anyone your seed words or private keys or passwords. Someone might try to take advantage of you that way--if you give up such info, you might lose your money.

I just got started with bitcoin myself, having bought my first 0.1 piece through Coinbase a few days ago. I'd say, buy whatever amount you feel comfortable risking. Now seems to be a great time too, while the prices are down from a peak of well over $1100 earlier.
