As I slowly watch the price drop from $114 to $102 over the weekend you guys went down I figured when you put the cash deposit back up it would be flooded. 
Thanks for putting up with the abuse, I'm sure none of you are getting recognition for what you're putting up with. Be sure everyone has a few drinks :)

Yeah Bitinstant is a shitty site because their new site they just launched today is having a few hiccups no one could have seen! Who could have perceived that their designer guy made a few mistakes...
Seriously just think of the position they are in. All of their workers are busting their ass answering the same questions over and over while their IT guys are being yelled at on why it hasn't been fixed yet. Sounds like a shitty day and a shitty upcoming week for that team.

It's the first day of their new website being up and cash deposits being back online. I've been reading up on Bitinstants blog and the FAQ/support section cause I'm in the same boat (waiting on $250 for 5 hours now). 
They are aware of the problems, it seems that this is very common and they are just having hiccups with their new website working properly. Just be patient. I remember reading they hired 3 new full time people to help them out and it seems they are still overwhelmed with this chaos lol.

They are only losing money and business from this downtime. They are probably losing their minds from this.

No I haven't. I don't think anyone has due to something on their website stopping everything from going threw. I wouldn't worry about it. They have our money in limbo, it's not lost. It's just on hold until they fix their new site then I would assume everyones transactions will slowly go threw.

I figured the price would go a little over what I payed, since we're dealing with a constantly changing currency. I'm new to BTC so I'm not familiar with what happened before.
What scares me is when all of these transactions go threw the system the BTC price will jump.. Then it will go back down and level out.
