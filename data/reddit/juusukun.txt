I didn't ask you if you think it will go up less than it goes down, I asked you what if?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:07:46
But what if it goes up less than it goes down?

Where is this random number of people who own more bit coins than you coming from? What if large numbers of bit coins are owned by small numbers of people?

Okay asshole, do you honestly believe I thought he was still president? Rhetorical fucking question.
You know how we got to where we are today? Forgetting about history and not learning from it. Jesus Christ, can you be any more stupid? You have to actively make the world a shittier place with your bad attitude? People listen to that shit and monkey see monkey do.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:35:06
At this point no one cares what you care about.
Do you think otherwise? Because its quite useless when people cannot interact with others and hold coherent conversations and just spew out random facts about themselves.

Am I? I'm pretty sure I included law in there too...
Do we have different definitions of the word "just?" Or do you always exaggurate this much while being unneccessarily rude?
Maybe shift focus away from me, and back to my argument, and tell me whats wrong with it rather than attacking me as an individual (ad hominem). Yeah, they teach us logic and fallacies in business school. Finance. Law.
In Canada you are required to pay taxes on BTC transactions, not just exchanging to CAD. This is the same with all currencies, crypto-currencies are not different. Those who do not pay taxes on transactions are committing tax evasion whether they are caught or not. If you leave your gains in BTC, never realize them, and risk losing them, then you don't pay tax.
I can't quickly find clarification on what the law is in the US, but might I remind you that the USA isn't the only country in the world, and other countries do things differently?
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:41:03
Well it seems like it was just the two of us this deep in the tread. If you wanna make that claim go ahead, but its the only logical conclusion. You've heard of logic right? Part of it is the absense of emotion, the other is that it makes sense. Here's my comment again:


And you respond with 


Are you projecting? I don't see any signs of pent up anger. You on the other hand... 


Well to start, I'm one person, you're talking to one person right now, I am not responsible for other supporters or us all. At this point, you could have some pent up anger, but its being masked behind a cool yet condescending attitude.
At least you're not telling me I'm fucking insane or retarded. By the way, if I had any pent up anger, I'd probably be talking to you like that.
Whatever, I don't care because I can't stop you, go defend not giving back to society just a fraction of what it gave you, and insulting supporters of politicians that actually give a flying fuck about the country you claim is entirely not worth the effort. That defeatist attitude is what got us here. There will always be assholes in society, but when apathy spreads so does inaction. So thanks for playing your part in fucking up the world. Adios.

Is that legal?
Also... does the current decay we are already faced with somehow convince you towards not paying taxes??? Shouldn't it be the opposite? The need for funding is more dire than ever. If they weren't in a state of decay, you'd be more willing to pay taxes? Thats what your comment reads like.

Especially with the btc gains. You gotta be an ass to get rich and be ok with roads and schools falling apart. Hospitals too if you're not American.

Ok thanks for the disagree vote. Retroactively gave you two not just one. And the blanket statement. Bernie says thanks for pretending he doesn't exist.

50% income bracket tax? Thats purely from wages and salaries? Income is a broader term here in Canada, and in the USA too as far as I know.
Also, do your tax brackets work like ours? Only XX% tax on income that falls into the top bracket, so in the end the effective/average income tax rate is lower than people who end up making it to the top bracket. This is rarely clarified when politics and economics are discussed, and this has no doubt led to the historically low tax rates in North America, especially if Trump's cuts are approved.
The way I look at it, is that work requires more effort than investment. There is less risk, but workers and investors alike face the consequences of risk when businesses fail. Workers not having a choice when it comes to risk kind of cancels that out, and it really should come down to effort. If income that requires high effort is taxed proportionately higher than income that is low effort (taking into account cost of living and everything), then you're feeding income and wealth inequality, not starving it or trying to put an end to it. Also more weight should be put into the here and now, especially when jobs need to be filled by someone. If someone spent more time in school and ends up in a low effort but high skill career, they shouldn't have any better access to the necessities of life than everyone else.

No argument there, and not what I was thinking of. Thinking of the high tax rates when all those things were built for the very first time. After expansion slowed down the government became more corrupted and shifted its priorities
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:04:10
Both wrong and right. Depends on the person. If they have suspicions they will investigate.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:06:30
You think they're the only country that does that? Only shady countries don't tax that shit.
You think it's ok for a labourer to be taxed but not an investor? Fuck why not just go back to full on slavery and get the whip out?

Most, not all. Bill Gates is an example, guilt of being a prick in his younger years seems to have caught up with him.

Ha the private sector and privatization is good about turning a profit...
If you honestly think private means better infrastructure I suggest you compare private ISPs to municipal funded projects. World's apart. Private is not better except for investors and the rich.

Yeah I feel like Belgium could do more to fight wealth inequality.
In Canada AFAIK tax brackets apply to total income. RoI like dividends lead to tax credits rather than being taxed separately. Personally I think Belgium's system sounds easier, but it can still be adjusted to better combat wealth and income inequality.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:11:57
Do they tax the wages and salaries of hard workers? labourers? skilled workers?
If they tax that, but not gains from rich people sitting back while their money makes more money, multiplies exponentially... then yes. They're shady.
Taxes should come from those who are actually in a position to pay them
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:16:07
You didn't even read my message.
Simply holding equity **is not** the same as that equity rising in value and then being realized which **is** a tax event...
Do you have a habit of telling people who disagree with you that they're fucking nuts? Really strengthens your argument.
Lets look at it this way. Income from manual labour, skilled labour is taxed. These people work hard for a small amount of money. Income from return on investments requires little to no effort, and these people receive a much larger amount of money.
Without you getting angry and swearing at me, can you calmly agree that you believe workers should be taxed, but not investors?
In Canada you are not only taxed when you convert BTC to CAD, but when you use BTC to purchase goods and services. Which is the way it should be, as soon as you **realize** the gains, you pay tax. You don't pay tax when your equity rises in value, or get a refund when it drops.
So tell me, what "shit" and I making up exactly?


This? Please quote where I made this statement. These are **your** words.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:10:15
Because if you have the ability to refuse to pay taxes to a corrupt government, then everyone else has the ability to refuse to pay taxes to a legitimate one. Fix the government. Running away from problems and tax evasion won't help fix it, probably the opposite.

Depending on the law you may have to claim your income regardless of what currency it is in. I haven't the slightest clue, probably only going to generate income through work my entire life.
Also, you're not already paying your share. You're paying a fraction of it. Everyone else (who isn't guilty of tax fraud/evasion) who has an "income", and then return on investments on top of that, is paying their **complete** share of taxes especially if their investments are all in USD. Your RoI is part of your income.... not separate. Income is more inclusive than "wage" or "salary." Terms you probably meant to use.

No, like the high tax rates, infrastructure development and maintenance back, waaaaaaaaay back, much closer to when the country was founded.
