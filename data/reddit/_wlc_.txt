Just talked with the others and we will add qr streaming in the near future. Will probably start working on it next week. The data is already designed to be qr optimised (as it was the original idea so that saves som space also). So hopefully we'll have something to show in a week or two.

Yeah for many transactions it would probably be enough. But for transactions with many inputs and outputs it wont.
We do support transaction batching as standard also. So even though it saves space on the blockchain if you have a lot of outputs the single transaction size gets larger. Putting 3k bytes in a single QR makes it harder to scan also, requiring a good camera. So you want some margin there.

Will do!
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:03:50
Maybe in the future as an option. The original idea was to use QR to send the data, but mainly because it is easier to implement. However for larger transactions one QR code would not be enough and it would not be a nice experience to use.
I am unaware of possibility of hacking phones through bluetooth. I would be interested to read about that if you have more information. You do need a phone with Bluetooth 4 or later so really really old phones wont work.
The information sent via BLE is the same data that is later published on the blockchain. You also manually verify the transaction before signing in order to make sure your wallet have not been compromised.
BLE communication is also encrypted with a connection code and our secret key. So it is not possible to sniff to connect a person with an address for example.

Yes, we will support lightning.

We hope our solution makes it easier for people to adopt offline storage. For most people starting using a Ledger or a Trezor is a big step. The biggest step in that is that you actually need to buy the hardware.
We do not think we will convert users who already bought a Trezor or a Ledger.
Anyone with a supported phone can start using COINiD offline storage now and be up and running in 10 minutes.

You use an extra spare phone to store the cold wallet private keys. So no need to carry it with you. Lock it in a safe preferably.
You can still monitor your balance on your regular phone via the wallet app (the wallet app never sees your private keys).

Interesting points, thank you.
Yes users of COINiD would need to rely on that the phone firmware have not been tampered with by the manufacturer. But it would be relatively easy to detect (with the right instruments) if a phone were communicating wirelessly even though it was set to offline. I also believe that it would be suicidal for a company like Apple to add such a backdoor. They would also have to access the encrypted information in the keychain.

Sorry, it was merely meant in jest and to raise some eyebrows. We really like Ledger. But yeah we should probably have not gone with such an aggressive pitch.


The source is available for anyone to check.


Personally I think it is more convenient than using any other cold storage. Hope you can give it a try. Testnet wallet is available.


It is specified. You are in control of your keys. That's kind of the main thing... It is stored and encrypted on your phone (for iOS in the keychain). And in regards to the cold wallet never even exposed to an online environment.
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:11:24
Why do you think that? The cold storage phone is kept completely offline. Your keys are never exposed to an online environment.
@_date: 2018-05-23 00:18:40
Thanks! We are working hard. Hope to get both the Android and iOS versions released on their respective app stores in the near future.

Sourcecode here: 
@_date: 2018-11-08 08:56:01
Yes we are.
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:54:38
Yes, fingerprint and also faceid.
@_date: 2018-11-08 08:54:33
It connects to multiple blockbook servers to fetch and validate transaction history. We are going to allow using a custom blockbook server in the future so anyone can run their own node.

You can find a couple of more graphs here showing vsize instead of percentage:

It is open source so you can check the source.
Otherwise you can always switch to QR instead of bluetooth and then analyse what is sent in the QR codes with any regular QR reader.
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:06:19
Also worth noting is that you can choose between BLE and QR to transport data between the devices depending on your preference.
@_date: 2019-01-27 20:02:18
It is open source but not an open source project. We merge with the public repo every time we deploy an update.
@_date: 2018-11-07 22:25:19
With QR code data transfer or bluetooth low energy.
We built custom libs to handle the communication.
Here is an older video explaining it a bit: 
(The video shows how it communicates with the offline device using BLE)

We do sign the android releases that we distribute ourselves.
Only way to fully trust released builds is with gitian builds or similar systems so that multiple builders can create identical binaries.  As far as I know no mobile wallet provide such builds. We want to provide this with instructions in the future though.
@_date: 2019-01-27 19:00:30
Yes it is 
@_date: 2019-01-27 20:32:03
We are using the estimatesmartfee from core. Actually via a blockbook backend.
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:24:09
Yes, but it allows for even lower fees than regular segwit addresses.
@_date: 2019-01-27 20:35:13
Here it is:  
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:04:39
Calculation is based on 5 inputs and 1 output for change + x outputs to recipient addresses.
So 100% is 2 outputs (1 for change) and 5 inputs using only legacy addresses.
Using the formula here for vsize estimation:

This is awesome. But yeah the price compared to buying at other exchanges is a bit too high for me personally.
