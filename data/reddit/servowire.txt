You send a letter to your friend in a yellow envelop. It contains 1 dollar. Your friend is evil and says the letter never arrived. The postal service only checks for "yellow" letters, but the friend (who is evil) changed the colour of the envelope by fishing it out of the mailbox in transit.
You think "Ok, he must not have gotten it, let me resend".
He now has 2 dollars instead of 1.
Instead, the postal service should have kept a transaction log _and_ open up the letter in transit to check if your friend has gotten the USD by looking at the serial number.

Because that 0.031337 is dust sent to the address by a spammer in 2012.
If you use that input to transfer the coins out, it "taints" your transaction because that dust clings to you.
These coins were moved input by input, so they don't get mixed up. Very smart, must be using some wallet with coin control or doing manual transaction.

Focus on Bitcoin: The protocol too. Bitcoin it's first adoption (as a currency) is only the first application. Remember that Bitcoin is and will be used in other settings like namecoin (a DNS system, not a currency), etc.
@_date: 2014-02-24 15:46:59
It's not a paywall. It's a "wall".
Ok, so some Bitcoiners have a lot of coins. They are called whales. They have bots (computers) that place sell orders in huge numbers somewhere in the orderbook that will appear as a "wall" of Bitcoin that needs to sell **all** before the price can get any higher.
Usally these walls are fake. They place them up in the orderbook but before anyone starts eating it, they delete or cancel the order (hence: Bots trading).
It's like a game of chicken. If the bots fail to remove it quick enough they could loose the coins because the order will complete. They try to scare others in panic-selling.

Also, that is not how 51% attack works. They are mis-informed.
They can _as long as they stay 51%_ 
* Reverse transactions that **he sends** while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
* Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations (delay)
* Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks (delay)
They can't:
* Reverse **other people's** transactions
* Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
* Change the number of coins generated per block
* Create coins out of thin air
* Send coins that never belonged to him
So basicly it's a DDos lagging the blockchain, as long as they **keep on holding 51% of computing power**
That's very pricy to do.
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:23:48
**About Mining** 
You seem to have a skewed look on Mining and Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics.
That is not how it works. The size of the blockchain OR the amount of transaction has nothing to do with the cost of mining. The cost of mining is a) Cost of hardware b) Power consumption c) Power price. 
Because of this, miners only mine when profitable. People with cheap power can mine, or people that are smart enough to build hardware, etc. People that can't will stop - and the network adjust itself with a concept called "difficulty".
Therefore, an hybrid market of supply/demand in mining power exists. There is even a "stock market" for mining power nowadays, but that is another story.
To summarize: Mining power is there to **secure** each **block**, not to **process** transactions.
**About price &amp; market**


There will be less and less coins mined at each block halvening event. Why would more coins be "introduced" - to "what" ecosystem exactly? 
If you truly believe the price will crash to $0 you can become very rich - take a put/short position in the Bitcoin price. I would advice against that though.
@_date: 2014-02-23 06:46:41
True, but it is an experiment. Mainstream adoption is not happening for years and years - Bitcoin might even not be ready yet, or it may never happen and fail. The idea is that owning Bitcoin is like owning digital cash - different from putting money in a bank, once you put it there it's no longer yours (you have a claim on the bank for the amount though).
If it is stolen - like cash - it's gone. 
Loans: Yes, you can.  - And with apps/startups like bridgewalkerapp.com you can even keep the Bitcoins as USD value so you don't run a volatility risk.
Again, Bitcoin is beta - please don't put all your money into this ...

@_date: 2014-01-31 07:41:06
As I interpret it, yes.


send mined Bitcoin to any other person or place for the benefit of another. Instead, the user is 
free to use the mined virtual currency or its equivalent for the user’s own purposes, such as to 
purchase real or virtual goods and services for the user’s own use. **To the extent** that a user mines 
Bitcoin and **uses the Bitcoin solely for the user’s own purposes and not for the benefit of another, 
the user is not an MSB under FinCEN’s regulations.**
You mine for the benefit of another. You are the miner, mining (creating) coins for the benefit of others. Therfore FinCEN thinks you are a MSB.
Disclaimer: I'm not sure.

1 million computers mining on CPU.
Rough estimate: An normal load is about 40 watts. 100% CPU load would double that. So we have 40watt power usage x 1 million systems = 40,000,000 watts of power. So 40,000 Kw/h burning away and only mining .12 BTC. Roughly the same as 12 Terraminers. They would only use 12 Kw/h
Energy efficiency of 0.03%.

There are 2^128 addresses. So 340282366920938000000000000000000000000
Let's say you can can use the entire computing power of the planet to generate addresses. 
A very fast CPU does about 750,000 Keys/s
Let's just multiply that by factor 10 as an average CPU. Very unrealistic, but just because. So we are stating that each computer on earth does 7,500,000,000 Keys/s
There are 1 Billion (1,000,000,000) computers on earth
THat would end up as
* 340282366920938000000000000000000000000	keys
* 7500000000	keys per second per computer (way too much to be realistic)
* 1000000000	computers on earth ( over-done)
* 7500000000000000000	combined speed keys per second
* 45370982256125100000	number of seconds it would take to generate all keys 
* 1438704409440.8	Converted to ...YEARS it will take
That is 1,438,704,409,440 Years. That might be a problem there.
Edit: This math sucks, I am not even taking into consideration that there will be DOUBLE generated addresses, at horrible efficiency. Also, the power that this requires is insane.  
Edit2: There is another problem. You need to CHECK each address on the blockchain. This takes IO. Each IO takes a certain amount of power. Let's say you make some sort of supercomputer that does not waste power, and uses the minimal amount possible to check an address on the blockchain. Don't ask me how, because this is the Twilight zone right here.

Imho Virusses that target Mac are now more common then a properly patched Linux system.
If you do not run AV and use your system daily your system could be comprimised in anyway. Don't keep any reasonable amount of Bitcoin on a daily laptop.
Do you have the seed written down? 
* Install a proper OS (Debian, Ubuntu) on an old laptop. 
* Install Electrum
* Input the seed
* Voila, your wallet is now on a different OS
*Warning: If you ever imported privatekeys (from a paper wallet) those are not recoverable through the seed.*
Optional, after completion of the steps above:
* Create another user on the system
* Run Electrum on that different user name (you will get a NEW SEED)
* Write it down. Protect it well
* Transfer funds from user1 to user2
* Voila, you have the funds also in a new fresh wallet.
Last but least, some more optional steps;
* Sell your macbook for something cheaper and stick with Ubuntu.
* Take your spouse to dinner with the difference.
* Have a nice evening, happy to have your BTC secure.

True. This would however become harder and harder when the nodes are known to be "evil" and they would get blacklisted. It would cost more and more to setup, get reputation as a good host and exploit the system then the transaction is worth.

17 Trillion = 17,000,000,000,000,000,000. 
Bitcoin has 21M coins, dividable to 100,000,000.
17,000,000,000,000,000,000 USD
Devided by
21,000,000,000,000,000 Satoshi

The novelty of the meme will wear off and Bitcoiners that got into Doge will "cash out" to BTC when they get bored when price stagnates. After all we are all greedy and people will want their sweet USD before it's too late. 
The inflation of the amount of Doge is so high, that every day there are more Doge mined then BTC is _in existence_ (720,000,000 Doge per day).
There is not even enough BTC in exchanges to cover even 1 day of Doge at current price.

They don't hold your coins, it's multisig. 2 of 3 would mean you have 1 Key on your computer, 1 Key totally offline and they also have 1. You can spend by using their multisig service (1+1=2) and in case they disappear: You always have the offline third key.
I can see people using this service when  they can't secure they're own coins themselfs (Because this requires an (for an avarage Joe) insane amount of knowledge on security).

A 50k transaction is more likely to be "fake" then a $1 transaction. This is because it takes a lot of computing power to "fool" the network by doing a double-spending attack.
Once the confirm is done and the transaction is mined, it's there forever.
You have to ask yourself. What is the a) money involved in order to fake a zero confirm and b) the chance of the block not being mined because (for example) there was no fee included.
Simple rule:
* $1 to $50 - 0 confirm is okay
* $50 to $100 - 1 confirm
* $100 to $500 - 2 confirms
* $500 to $1000 - 3 confirms
* Higher then that you enter scammer country, and you have to wait 5 or more confirms.
Be safe.

They still make printers (prof. - quite good!) and I think they still did video cams in like 2010 or something. But who needs a video cam when you have a 10MP Phone, right?

Your website is... different. :) The humor aspect of the website took me a while and left me confused for a minute.
The idea is very very good, but security is the weakest link.  To start, a suggestion;
**Salting** Make the salt pseudorandom; people are lazy to change it and careless and "braincontrolmesalt" as a default salt makes rainbow attacks easy. Maybe make it a combination of 3 words that you randomize? (AlphaBetaDelta, etc) or maybe use some visual?
**Hosting** Maybe host the JS code on Github? That way there is some (tiny) security because of versioning/revisioning. A DNS hijack will just instantly destroy your securitymodel at the moment. Also; otherwise, please use HTTPS and a certificate.
**The heart***
The main keygen code seems to be
    var keys = btc.keys(Crypto.SHA256(salt+url+Crypto.SHA256(username+password+pin)));
Is this correct? Using the URL also kind of makes is dangerous imho; small segments of the URL could change and break the wallet, right? The URL is a static variable, so might as well use a VeryLongSentence as replacement for some obscurity.

You are mistaken about Bitcoin protocol. It will always be mined; difficulty can also go _down_.

For all you devs out there: 
Put your wallet keyfiles (for your hot wallet) on an encrypted volume, that needs a password every time you boot. (like a mountpoint called /wallet or something).
Place only the wallet file on there, so your system can boot without KVM access, but requires a typed in password for mounting the wallet.
This stops physical attacks like SingleUser attacks like this.

I posted this earlier. The math might be wrong, but it's to get an idea.
There are 2^128 addresses. So 340282366920938000000000000000000000000
Let's say you can can use the entire computing power of the planet to generate addresses. 
A very fast CPU does about 750,000 Keys/s
Let's just multiply that by factor 10 as an average CPU. Very unrealistic, but just because. So we are stating that each computer on earth does 7,500,000,000 Keys/s
There are 1 Billion (1,000,000,000) computers on earth
THat would end up as
* 340282366920938000000000000000000000000	keys
* 7500000000	keys per second per computer (way too much to be realistic)
* 1000000000	computers on earth ( over-done)
* 7500000000000000000	combined speed keys per second
* 45370982256125100000	number of seconds it would take to generate all keys 
* 1438704409440.8	Converted to ...YEARS it will take
That is 1,438,704,409,440 Years. That might be a problem there.
Edit: This math sucks, I am not even taking into consideration that there will be DOUBLE generated addresses, at horrible efficiency. Also, the power that this requires is insane.  
Edit2: There is another problem. You need to CHECK each address on the blockchain. This takes IO. Each IO takes a certain amount of power. Let's say you make some sort of supercomputer that does not waste power, and uses the minimal amount possible to check an address on the blockchain. Don't ask me how, because this is the Twilight zone right here. This supercolmputer would use more power then several starts combined.
Better start building that Dyson sphere before you start hashing.

Well now, this is a person, as a business, putting coins into circulation. Basicly any _pool operator_ that is large enough to be considered and/or registrered as a business. But the definition states issuing _and_ redeeming (withdraw from circulation). One can't _withdraw_ Bitcoin from circulation by definition. That's a weird definition.

They are saying here: It does not matter _how_ you get it, but what you do with it that could make you a MSB after all. Strange.
**On the the next document - 


paying and receiving the equivalent value in currency of legal tender to and from 
counterparties, ............. In effect, when the Company invests in a convertible virtual currency for its own 
account, and when it realizes the value of its investment, it is acting as a user of that 
convertible virtual currency within the meaning of the guidance. 
OK Good. Seems reasonable. As a business you can let your consumers pay in Bitcoin, and hoard them if you like.


counterparties, creditors, or owners entitled to direct payments should be closely scrutinized, 
as they may constitute money transmission. (See footnote 10 to this ruling.)
This is interesting. If you take Bitcoin as a payment it's fine (point above) but if you start paying your employers or creditors or stakeholders _in bitcoin_ you _might_ be Money Transmitting. MT license required?
It's a pretty clear statement &amp; ruling by Fincen, I'm impressed. I would like these points above explained, maybe I'm misinterpreting the statements.

Mining strengthens the network. But because Bitcoin mining got really really big you need proper mining power costing you a lot of money. You play big or you just loose money (or Bitcoin) doing it.
I would advise against it, unless you are doing it for fun.

Ah. Well the address you check on Blockchain is just _one_ of the many addreses QT uses as one its receiving addresses.
From the wiki


You can use Pywallet to dump all the addresses the QT wallet.dat is using to build your entire balance. I would not recommend this. It's for advanced use.
I think you can send your entire balance to yourself. But this is not recommended. Don't. In IT this is called "behaviour by design".
TLDR; Yes your wallet.dat contains 1.085 if it says so. Backup that file every time your make a lot of transactions and you are safe. The change addresses are pre-generated (50 I think). Backup is safe.

**Technically it's a hosted wallet at an exchange. The coins are not 100% in your control once you do not have the privatekey. I would not advise you keep them there unless you have a good reason to do so ( daytrading).**


**Any smartphone wallet would do. You could also use coinapult.com to send via SMS.**


**When you create a paper wallet the privatekey on that wallet is very important. If somebody gets it, your BTC is gone. Remember to generate on an offline, safe computer and don't print on a corporate network printer (those things tend to cache jobs on local storage for auditing).**
 


**The paper wallet cannot be used as payment when the counterparty does not trust you. If you give person B the paper wallet, how does person B know that you won't scam him and transfer the Bitcoin away the moment you part ways? Paper wallets are to be sealed and stored at a very safe place.**

You don't get the largest portion of the blockchain over the default sync, you get it by copy or Torrent.

Double spending attacks cost a lot of money to do. Below a certain amount of BTC you are safe to go with 0-confirmed transactions. Time will well where that number is.

I think the misconception here is that the "video cards" are printing the coins. The videocards (asics now) are only securing the blockchain (by doing hashing) and once every 10 minutes. So the mining nodes (what you call video cards) are essentially a large group of accountants maintaining a public ledged of accounting.
Bitcoin is a very big book with transactions, called the Blockchain. Your balance is on several pages (every time you make a transaction).
To change your balance you would have to change the numbers - but you can't - every node/miner in the world has the same book (ledger) and they disagree.
Each page is closed off by mining a "block" (page). THe block has a special lock on it that everybody agrees upon finding. The person who does gets the reward (25BTC) - created, yes, in network concensus out of nowhere.
Counterfeit? You can't change the balance, you can only change the "block" by mining it. But that takes incredible computing power. Even IF you mine a block and try to "counterfeit" coins or don't play nice the network would even tear out that page due to misbehave-our (automatic).

I've been thinking about this a lot, and I agree. I will tell you why; People want adoption and they will get it. Now maybe 300k USD per day, but soon maybe Millions per day.
Those coins are sold again on the exchanges, and the money flowing in won't be able to "keep up" for the first few years.
At current price, there is way too much "USD" released per day. 3600 coins per day is 3,240,000 USD worth (at $900 per pop).
At a certain point the coin-pool will get shallower because the protocol releases less and less coins. And the price will rise again.
Do it, downvote me into obscurity, but this is what I think will happen _the coming year_. After that, and maybe block-halve: Moon.

Good points. It's even better - If some part of the Devs would think changing the code to "release more coins" - the vanilla blockchain would not agree and the non-patched nodes will go on with Vanilla Bitcoin. It would create Bitcoin-original and Bitcoin-faux.
Changing the amount of coins in software is possible, changing the amount of coins in the orginal Bitcoin blockchain &amp; network is not.

In my opinion;
It´s not the most useful substance. Silver is way more useful in industrial use. Gold is not very rare long term - It can be made with fission and the universe is filled with the stuff. Also you can't send Gold across the planet in milliseconds, hold large amounts your pocket, secure it, and it lacks tangibility (needs melting).
It's not backed by inherent utility, it's backed by speculation and (current) scarcity.
But Gold is pretty though, must admit.

Not really. A double spending attack is more like 1 hour. You let the transaction include in 1, 2 or 3 blocks, and then reverse by sending out another transaction and pay a rogue miner and try to get the branch where your first transaction was to be orphaned.

True. A solution would be that if ASICS is made mass-production one could sell super cheap USB sticks that can be utilized by website owners to mine for them while they visit the website. A (by your example) million Block eruptors make up a lot of mining power and hardly use power. (2 watts instead of 40 and are 20x as quick).
Maybe that in the future hardware vendors implement some Bitcoin ASICS on every motherboard by default.
Still not the most efficient way, but at least not as wasteful as CPU mining.

This would, sorry to say, the Bitcoin into 2 chains: Vanilla-Bitcoin and Altcoin-Bitcoin (with this change). There will be people not accepint this change and they will be, like it or not, the original Bitcoin blockchain.
The network won't accept it, and you will fork the blockchain in 2 camps. Bitcoin protocol can be changed, but not the integrity parts like max. coins, blockspeed, hash algo, etc are not easy to be changed.

You can embed the impossibe-to-fake picture/key to a file in the Bitcoin network. That key is the undeniable proof that that file was in your possession at the moment of signing. No way to fake, hack or change it later on.
Then, they understood. Might be of help for someone when explaining it.

They are too large, I agree. But having 51% and maintaining 51% is not the same thing. Also, having 51% of the hashing power does not make you in total control.
They can however:
* Reverse transactions that *he sends* _while he's in control_. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
* Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
* Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
The attacker can't:
* Reverse other people's transactions
* Prevent transactions from being sent at all (they'll show as 0/unconfirmed)
* Change the number of coins generated per block
* Create coins out of thin air
* Send coins that never belonged to him
Remember Deepbit? They used to be big like this.

No need to be rude.
Try this: Install a watt-o-meter on your idle or browsing casually PC.
Then let it mine. You will see a significant increase in power usage once the CPU is hashing away at 100%. Some Xeon CPU's are 10 watt idle but 80 watt at full load. 
This is also noticeable when you play games on a laptop vs letting it sit idle in the corner. GPU's use even more power.
They could run Javascript version of a full Bitcoin node. That would strengthen the network but would not yield a profit because there is no mining involved.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:52:26
You misunderstand Bitcoin it's use. It's not a get rich quick scheme. 
But if everybody suddenly, for any reason, wanted to sell his/her's Bitcoin it would certainly crash the price. Like if all Gold derivatives would suddenly be dumped on the market.

There is a problem with that. Once anyone forces Bitcoin protocol to change in any way that changes the integrity, mining ecosystem or security, a certain amount of people and miners will not agree.
Let's say there are 4 miners: Joe, Jack, Jill and Sarah. US Govt. decides there should be a backdoor of sorts and JOe and Jack agree. Jill and Sarah (living outside of the USA) don't.
What happends is that the BLockchain will fork into 2 new blockchains; Bitcoin-USA and Bitcoin. Your balance before the split will be the same, but afterwards the mining goes skewy and they are no longer compatible. A fork has happened.
The most important question will now be: What is the "real" Bitcoin, worth money?
So now that regulation of Bitcoin protocol (exchanges can be regulated, protocol can't) is out of the way. That leaves us with 2 more options: Let it be, or ban the use of Bitcoin by making it a crime.

Bitcoin itself is very secure. The platform on which you run it mostly ain't. Normal users run it on their daily systems and even worse; tainted Windows systems.

The Bitcoin code is distributed from bitcoin.org and is audited by a lot of devs. If someone would place backdoors/virusses/hacks/tainted coide, miners won't accept it.
A "hack" like some major security flaw would hurt Bitcoin, but some things have happened before and all the major mining pools upgraded very quick. (15th of May this year)

Calm down. If you look at the amount of Doge mined per minute (500k, and 250k in 30 days) those numbers are just insane. Dogecoin is like the Tutorial map in any game; it's fun for n00bs to get into and learn about crypto. It's cute and a lot of kids use it for "t3h lulz" - but it's a free market and it should be fine. I mean remember april? Back then a lot of people in the Litecoin community got worried about all the clones rising up, like Feather- and Chinacoin.
Why would Doge be a threat and not Litecoin/Worldcoin? The meme part will soon get annoying. Like any meme. The adoption of Bitcoin alone is going slow as it is, why would "the world"  adopt Doge? And if they do, Bitcoin will get adopted too. 
Altcoins are the cover-bands of Bitcoin. Some suck some rule, but they are just copycats. (or dogs. wow.)

Bitcoin is a very big book with transactions, called the Blockchain. Your balance is on several pages (every time you make a transaction).
To change your balance you would have to change the numbers - but you can't - every node/miner in the world has the same book (ledger) and they disagree.
Each page is closed off by mining a "block" (page). THe block has a special lock on it that everybody agrees upon finding. The person who does gets the reward (25BTC).
Counterfeit? You can't change the balance, you can only change the "block"  by mining it. But that takes incredible computing power. Even IF you mine a block and try to "counterfeit" coins or don't play nice the network would even tear out that page due to misbehave-our (automatic).
This is a pretty good Infographic:

Being your own bank means that - As a user you are responsible for your own asset just like keeping Gold safe.
Small amounts are fine on a phone (that is not filled with crap) or on a patched Linux/Win laptop with a proper firewall and general security practices.
Now, if you have larger amounts, you need a dedicated device that does not do anything else then keeping your BTC safe. Best thing I can give you is a "guide" to be almost as paranoid as possible, and keeping a good backup.
If you have more then like 200USD worth of Bitcoin, I would go this route;
* Buy an old crappy laptop, like a pentium-D with 256 MB ram
* Install Ubuntu on it, disable updates, etc.
* Install Electrum client, it has a nice recovery seed that is 15 words long. Write it down, it is your final en ultimate backup. keep it safe.
* Transfer funds to the laptop.
* Never, ever, use it for something else. Only for making transactions
This is very, very safe. imho. There is no factor of it getting hacked. I would recommend not even installing a web browser so you don't get tempted. Also: No SSH and no other crap.
If the notebook fails (harddrive crash) you always have the paper seed.
*PS* With devices like Trezor (google it) this paranoid approach will no longer be needed, mostly. 
*PPS* Bruteforcing a paper wallet would use more energy then our Sun would emit in it's entire life. Not happening.
*PPPS* Waar is het? :)

Edit: Even 2 BTC is "a lot" of money (imho) - I would recommend a standable Bitcoin-only laptop for that. Get an old $50 laptop with Ubuntu on it and you are safe. This is pretty safe route until Trezor-like devices emerge.

Blockchain-QT is not suited for the avarage Bitcoin user. It does not even help the network if you do not forward from your NAT router to your internal LAN.
If you are just using Bitcoin as a "user" and not running a full node, stick to Electrum or Multibit.
If you need the blockchain bootstrapped quickly, you can download the blockchain over Torrent.

I won't say Bitcoin is a waste of power (that we generate by using up our limited coal and running reactors that generate waste for our children to take care off). But sub 1% efficiency does not really fit the elegance of the idea of Bitcoin. This is imho.

You cannot destroy Bitcoins in a sense that they vanish. What you can do is send them to an address where you do not have the privatekey for.

Guessing the privatekey for that one would consume several total Solar outputs of power. We could conclude that those coins are unmoveable until the end of Bitcoin.

Nothing. Like all GNU/Opensource, Bitcoin is also open source, and for example, it has been cloned into altcoins over 100 times or more ( - all clones).

I think you will find more online/offline shops that accept Bitcoin then Gold to be honest, but you are right, Gold is historically valuable. This price is expressed in the amount of local currency of goods the counterparty is willing to give for an amount of Gold. What is the intrinsic value of Gold? Depends from person to person.
Gold it not scarce though, the universe is filled with the stuff. It's a logistical problem. Gold could potentially be made with fusion, also. (think in 10s to 100s of years in the future). But this is not really a realistic argument.
The idea of Bitcoin is that you have a comparable type of scarcity that is hard to make (like mining gold), combined with a network that allows the transaction of this "token" between zero-trust peers. It allows for instant worldwide settlement or consensus of debt and payment. 
Every market that has considerable footprint will attract speculators. Bitcoin is only a few years old.

Adoption is causing cashouts that will drive the price down, this is logical. Those coins spend are hardly replenished by "new money" because most Bitcoiners are poor as church mice. Like me.

People that are "late" (last half year) mostly got coin at $500+ level or higher. They won't spend coins below buying price. Also: Buying coin is still a bit hard (non-US) and why would you buy stuff with it?
Only very early adopters buy (big) items like Tesla cars and expensive cars because..... otherwise they would not be able to afford them. All these coins are sold for USD (car dealer does not want btc, has to pay his suppliers in USD).
Long-long term can be up, because at a certain point the inflow is larger then the outflow. Currently there are just too many coins mined per day (3600), too much selling, a lot of inflation, uncertainty with the Chinese, and too much sell/dumping pressure on the exchanges.
Again, this is all imho.

Bitcoin-qt uses change addreses. When you Send from your wallet (A) to destination (B) the remainder inputs(!) goes to C. 
Lets say you have 3 inputs. One is 1BTC, one is 0.084 and one is 0.001 You send 0.066 to address B. It uses one of the inputs and sends the rest to a **new address**.  
Blockchain only uses 1 address (A) and this messes things up. Be very carefull to backup your QT wallet.dat because the change address is in there **and not on blockchain.info**
TLDR; If you dont want trouble, don't use 2 wallets at the same time, please.
TLDR2; Bitcoin-QT is not really the best client for the average user; see  - I would advise Electrum myself because of the seed that can recover your entire wallet and you can write it down.

Ok, so if everyone was honest (I am) and declares the virtual capital gain on Bitcoin, they would have to sell a bit of their Bitcoin to cover tax. If everyone does this, the sell pressure during tax deadlines is huge and kills the price. (this does not happen in stock, because capital gains while you "stay" in the stock are not tax afaik).

If you have more then like 200USD worth of Bitcoin, I would go this route;
* Buy an old crappy laptop, like a pentium-D with 256 MB ram - oldskool yo!
* Install Ubuntu on it, disable updates, etc. 
* Install Electrum client, it has a nice recovery seed that is 15 words long. Write it down, it is your final en ultimate backup. keep it safe (read in Gandalf's voice).
* Transfer funds to the laptop. 
* Never, ever, use it for something else. Only for making transactions
This is very, very safe. imho.
There is no factor of it getting hacked. I would recommend not even installing a web browser so you don't get tempted. Also: No SSH and no other crap.
If the notebook fails (harddrive crash) you always have the paper seed.
Good luck!

nice idea.
2 things to put in the FAQ:
1)Thermal paper? better be carefull storing it; it will get back when hot. Also never seal it ;)
2)When importing from paper back to your wallet, always for the love of Bitcoin always import the entire balance. Why? because of the "change" mechanism you could otherwise loose the balance.

Bitcoin does not even use _encryption_, it's just SHA-256 _hashing_.
There is no "Backdoor" - the protocol is open soure. Using mr Snowden's name in this context is out-of-place.
SHA256 is used as the mining hashing (using Nonces). So if the NSA would have some magic SHA256 trick they could _mine_ blocks faster, people would notice. Also, it's not about finding a Privkey, it's about finding a hash with a certain amount of nonces.
The adressing (so the thing securing your wallet's privatekey) is done by ECDSA (and some SHA256).

You need a backup and a disaster recovery backup.
Mind you, exporting the private keys from wallet.dat is not enough, after your make a transaction there is a new private key created (this is called the "change" address). Having 10BTC balance, and making a 1 BTC payment means having 9 BTC on a new address. Be careful out there.

A visualization I sometimes use:
Doing the accounting for all user that participate. Miners are a room full of accountants checking the books. First to solve "the magical key" to today's fiscal balance gets a free buck. He shouts "I've got it!" - all the other accountants verify his calculations and at least 51% of them have to agree. After that they solve the next page of the book (=blockchain).
* Gets harder for each accountant to be first to solve a page the more accountants there are.
* It's hard work that actually helps the trustworthiness of "the book".
* If accountants leave the room, its not a problem.
* Some accountants are fast, some slow.
* Rogue accountants that mess with figures are ignored and marked "bad".
* Rogue accountants that falsely try to shout "I've got it" get ignored and marked "bad"
Does not add up 100% but is pretty close.

About $100. Before you downvote, please read.
I'll tell you why, and how. The worlds govt. are in the process of "acknowledging" bitcoin as a legal currency or commodity. This is a bad thing, because once it has a legal description and/or handle, laws can be made. They will try (and fail) to enforce regulation; because regulation is not possible on something that is scattered and decentralized.
Next they will simply ban it as a technology; It's a new form of tech so the law will be pretty specific and the law will cover all alts and clever ways to get around it. "Store of value by using computer cryptography in any form" or something like that.
Bitcoin will be, unfortunately, worth not a whole lot. The netwerk will survive and it will still be trade-able on some foreign exchanges and on localbitcoin. 
My guess is that by July 2014 it's about dropped to to 100USD level.
And I will be very sad about it.

It is verifying the transactions on the bitcoin netwerk, by solving the "magic" key that fits each block (every 10 minutes).
The key is bigger and bigger as more miners join this process, therefore the reward needs to be cut up to more people in so called "mining pools".
It's like a room full of accountants that need to solve the balance and account for all transactions and put a stamp on the page. The first to solve the page shouts it out, and the rest quickly checks if he did it.
Mining is maintaining the blockchain aka bitcoin. The magic key is called the "nonce" hash and it's a small but very hard to find puzzle that fits into the lock of the previous "magic key".
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:53:27

Only disadvantage is that it requires an investment, something an App or paper solution does not have. 
Maybe also make a "paper" wallet service for users to get into. You knonw, make a paper version of this device (private key unknown to them, to keep em safe) with an short-url to check the balance?
Either way, it's a nice device, hoping it's not running Linux or something. An appliance type of device is way more secure, so good job!

Good point. As we reach the end of the blocks to be mined that release coin, people will start to stop mining.
Hash rate drops, diff will drop, further making a 51% attack possible.
There is still fee to collect from transactions, and if (if) Bitcoin used daily a lot of transactions means a lot more fee, we are not even close to the 7 transactions per second (current hardlimit). Fee would be the new "25 per block" released. 
Good point, I think you have actually made a valid point. But we have time to adjust the network.
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:43:01
Blockchain only grows with 1 megabyte per 10 minutes (max!). At the moment each block is about 200kB big.
Lets take "worst case" and we have a blockchain growing 1MB per 10 minutes, the blockchain would grow 144MB per day or 52GB per year.
This is not really a problem, because Moore's law can keep up with it, and the current blockchain is not even compressed. 52GB is about 1 Bluray of data containing the entire Bitcoin network transactions of 1 year. Thatś not really that extreme now is it? It would take about 8 minutes to sync 1 year of BTC transactions over a gigabit connection.
But lets be fair and honest, it takes a long time to sync _over P2P_ if you start at block 0. Better to just download the bootstrap blockchain over Torrent and sync only the last few months or so......

Enforcing unique address can't be done, except if the client checks if the address exist before sending... ?
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:25:30
This. Reformats are not that bad, but installing a new OS + data is. If your disk writes to the sector where the wallet was, it's gone.
Sometimes you are in luck if the old installation was "Big" and the wallet was "at the end" of the disk.
SSD makes this worse, because they do random writes.
My guess: No. Could try GetDataBack (google it) - i think 1% chance.
@_date: 2013-12-23 09:32:29
The client enforces fee (some do) but you do not need to send fee if you really do not want.
Could take a while for your transaction to be mined, and a small chance it will be in limbo.
Most updates are backwards compatbile with older versions, if not there is an alert sent out to older clients to update (like with the hardfork earlier this year).
Minerpool operaters decide to update or not, but rogue updates installed on their pool would loose trust by the miners, so it's sort of like democracy.

No. Those wallets cannot be trusted 100%. 
The computer could have been comprimised, or the screen captured. The printer will be a a corporate Windows printer server that could cache or maybe even store prints for legal purposes (without your knowledge).
The printer itself could have stored the printjob on the disk or memory. 
The security in place at your work suits the business; this is not Bitcoin. If your investment is at least a 1000 dollars worth, I would recommend buying an old or cheap laptop, install Ubuntu on it, and electrum. Don't use the laptop for anything else but Electrum, and WRITE down the "seed" electrum gives you. Also set a password on Electrum and write it down too. Store somewhere very safe. 
* Laptop stolen? Unusable because password on Electrum
* Laptop crash? restore from seed
This is better then a paper wallet, but has the advantages of a paper wallet.

Litecoin has a nice purpose of an alternate blockchain. If Bitcoin prevails I think LTC will as well. There might even be room for 10s or 100s of blockchains. Scrypt, AES, why not make a DH type of blockchain? Maybe even higher than 256 encryption.

Ok, so forks are merged back to the main blockchain after re-join. This causes all transactions in both forks to become valid on both.
The only problem would be the double spending or double receiving. (and maybe even multi blocks down?) - How would you untangle this mess? (Send coin from A to Z through BCDEF... on 1 fork, not on the other, for like 1 hour of blocks ago? (6 blocks))
We can bet somebody is going to try to exploit this sooner or later.

I'm just saying that using the blockchain for something that it was not designed for is not best practice, and that this will be a huge argument (although false flag) against bitcoin once they realise they cannot fight it any other way. P2P ledger with "funnymoney" currency: No legal handle to attack. P2P ledger containing illegal content en actively spreading copyrighted material=legal handle.
By declaring a bitcoin miner/node as participating in P2P filesharing they will be attacked as such and this will hurt the network.

Depending on the amount of BTC, but if you have more than 1 BTC:
* Buy an old laptop for 50 to 100 dollars.
* install Ubuntu on it
* Install Electrum Client on it
* Run Electrum, write down the "seed" for recovery. Never type it in anywhere, do not email it, do not tell anyone. 
* Transfer the BTC to the Electrum wallet.
* Never use the laptop for anything else

If the world currency WAS backed by gold, Gold would be worth millions per ounce. Gold it not rare, not at all. The universe is filled with tens of millions of metric tons of the stuff.
It's logistical problem. 
If 1 ounce would be worth millions nature will be destroyed because suddenly those unprofitable mines become profitable again. Gold mining is terrible for the environment.
Also; gold can (only a few atoms now, but who knows in 10 years) be made with fusion, and it would take way way less power to counterfeit gold (fusion, i'm talking 30 years in the future) then to bruteforce Bitcoin (millions of Sun energy outputs).

No hostility here. It works a bit like this: The Bitcoin network is made up from nodes that run the same software (or protocol). They agree on a block being mined every 10 minutes. (Containing 25 BTC at the moment, soon to be less).
If one would push extreme (exponential) power to the network, the software would adjust the so called "diffeculty"
Each block must fit on the block in front of it, and if they start to be released too fast, the diff. changes.
It's like all nodes saying: Ok together we are doing *this* to fast, let's make it a bit harder for ourselfs.
Nodes that do not confirm to that "law" are simply ejected from the network ("bad nodes").
BTW: We have had exponentials increase of hashing power in the last 6 months. The diff did adjust, also, exponentially.

well, the formatted drive may still contain the wallet.dat. When formatting only the partition table is deleted and re-created, so files are still on the drive. New files overwrite the datablocks, so as long as you are lucky (file was at the "end" of the drive) it may be recoverable.
Try Getdataback for NTFS (software) and choose option "I formatted the drive".
I got back formatted baby pictures, financial data, and wedding pics from my customers this way.
Don't write anything to the drive in the meantime!
Edit: **warning** you talk about "paper wallets that represent the wallet.dat" - are you using Bitcoin-QT? 
Backing up your private keys (dumpprivkey) is _NOT_ enough, because with every transaction the remaining coins are sent to a new address. Example: So if you backup, send 0.1BTC to a friend, and loose the wallet **the coins are no longer at the paper-backup address**. Backing up the wallet.dat to DVD is good enough, because it contains 100 (not sure) future private keys for future transactions.

This. Facebook or Google could create a "Digital Currency" and everybody (yes, 99% of everybody) does not know about Bitcoin. They could even make it centralized and nobody would care, they would use it though...  
Mark my words, all the "cool kids" will start paying each other with Facecreds. or something silly, and all Bitcoiners will cringe.

No, the idea is you move it out of Coinbase asap.
But, because of the "be your own bank" you are responsible for those coins once you have them in your own wallet.

hi gavin, would it not be possible to p2p-segment the blockchain? To make it run int "Full-Blockchain-server-mode" and "Client mode"?
The "client mode" could contain 10% of the blockchain (random) - if an output is not known, it could ask another "client mode" client or a "full-blockchain-server-mode" node.

A silly brainfart; let the mining process process "known" coins (signed by Govt. special private key). Or make a "TTL" in the ledger, so that it has to go back to govt. node after a few signs.
This can be done by signing every smallest devideable (for instance 0,01 Dollar) with a private key itself.
It would be pseudo-decentralized, because if the Govt. node fails, the system collapses.

yes, you are right. 2 warnings:
* Brainwallets are not secure, you need a lot of entropy in the form random words, and humans cannot be random enough. Sentences as  "You will never guess this. Hooray" is not secure at all.It will be cracked in a few years.
* if generating a pub/private key pair in any way, keep in mind that the all depends on the security of you computer if this is safe. Best to do is save website (+Javascript) to a USB and boot a non-network PC, and destroy everything after you generated it. Be as paranoid as possible, and then a bit more.
If you want a paper "seed"- use Electrum client. It is a normal client, but has a paper "failsave" seed key, that you can remember or write down to recover you entire wallet. Magic. but it works.

Good Work!
Some thoughts: In future real-life a non-tech or poor person will only have a) a non-smartphone b) a btc address to send something to and.
Can't scan a QR code so entering the whole BTC address to pay for some fruit at the market would be too much hassle/error prone. Maybe create a digit-only, time-limited (to prevent getting enourmous amounts of these address as legacy).
Like so:
* Step 1: BTC merchant generates SMS-BTC address 
* Step 2: He get a "proxy address" like **2013 8 4565 5555 2222.**
* Step 3: The SMS only buyer can send coins without typing a long BTC address.
It will expire after 2013-8 (august) and sending coins to an expired address will bounce back to sender (fool proof).
Creation of theses SMS adddress should require sending an SMS to prevent abuse (sms costs money).
Sure, This still requires the merchant to create a SMS proxy, but that would be like 10 seconds to do even on a smartphone. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:23:18
The address is not even needed to get BTC out of the blockchain. Only having a private key is enough (clients scans the blockchain on import).
This means if a) a Typo b) a comprimised c) a damaged card would mean someone lost his BTC when they try to import.
How to solve this?

"Gary go check out what them geeks are doing with the bytecoins or something, stat".
What is going to happen (sort of makes sense in a way too, sorry) is that getting IN and OUT in USD will become regulated; at least for legit. businesses. I think AML does serve a purpose. This will mean that money will become scarce in the exchanges, getting it in and out will be harder - Will this drive the price up or down? Who knows?

He has a point, except: When you buy something with BTC, you are spending BTC (the whole USD conversion thing is done by the merchant/bitpay).
They are responsible for making the BTC into USD, so they are making "fictional gains" - and have to pay tax.

Gavin gave away 10BTC per person for free in 2010. For the fun of it.
Why? Because 1000BTC was not worth ANYTHING (a few cents per coin) back then. Hell, I even mined 50BTC with my CPU in matter of hours. I deleted the client afterwards because I thought it was boring.

Split brain is kind of possible with bitcoin. The chain splits up in 2 "chains".
Everything will keep on working, except when you send a transaction it ends up in 1 of the 2 chains.
If the network un-splits again, the transaction is taken into the main chain. 
If you double spent the input (rogue) only the transaction in the longest chain survives.

Your idea would be storing wallet.dat on a server that belongs to Google, somewhere (aka the "Cloud").
While this might save you from backup, you never really know where/who/what has access to that file. I would not be that paranoid, but if you had a lot of BTC I would rather just store it locally.
At least use a password (!) on the wallet, if storing outside of a machine that your manage.
A backup to DVD of wallet.dat is ok for several (google for the exact number) transactions into the future, no need to backup every time you transact.

Just to zoom out a little, let's go back to 2011.
Mining is never really super "rewarding". I was mining 1 BTC a day with 3GPU's. It cost me a lot of power (1Kwh constant) and my wife was complaining the heat and noise it was making. It was selling the coins at their market value, $3 $5 at some point a bit more, and was making a small profit.
I used some coins to buy 3D printing stuff, and later on summer came and I gave up mining. Got bored and a bit frustrated that the price has gone up this much, and thought it was unfair for me against big holders with 20k coins. (from cents to almost $7 dollar PER COIN). That was extreme, and $15 would really unsustainable, and the diffeculty went up too - I was mining half a coin a day, hardly worth the power.
Sold all my coins a few 100 dollars, and we went to celebrate summer.
Do you understand what I am saying? I'm not saying you should mine, or anything. Just giving you some history.
