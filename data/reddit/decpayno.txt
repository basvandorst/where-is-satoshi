No, look at the chart
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:15:51
If you’ve been in since 1k, I respect that, but we have been going down lately
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:02:17
We’ve been down the past 2 months or so

Sold my bitcoin to put it all into litecoin. Feeling good at this point, got into litecoin at 165
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:05:46
Were going down.

@_date: 2018-01-18 22:07:48
Last month
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:06:08
We are down lately. That’s all I’m saying.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:00:46
Where? One month we’re down, one week we are down, not going up right now
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:41:33
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:39:32
But why do so many people say we need it
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:13:26
Absolutely, instead of spending money on useless stuff, I spend it on bitcoin. Anything I make is just extra money.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:37:07
Thanks for the input, I had similar thoughts
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:34:03
You don’t need to buy an entire bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:38:28
Bitcoin was the first crypto? TIL
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:35:08
Solid post
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:09:51
But we aren’t talking tripling in price, for bitcoin to be worth one million, you have to have trillions of dollars invested/converted into it. This seems like it would take a lot of the value out of fiat
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:17:54
If worldwide fiat is worth 50 trillion and million dollar bitcoin is 21 trillion, almost half of the worlds currency is in bitcoin. This has to mess with fiat somehow significant 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:38:58
What do you mean it’s to be seen?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:39:02
Umm how
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:38:04
Luckily I’ve been blessed with a good job while being in school, so a few hundred dollars isn’t that much to me, so I’ll be hodling for a while
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:21:57
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:59:47
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:10:16
But those currencies would most likely be mostly converted to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:04:03
That doesn’t answer my question, I’m asking if bitcoin was worth a million dollars, would USD most likely be obsolete 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:38:49
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:14:45
What time does this go to lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:40:49
Why does GDAX go higher than others
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:32:58
If a dozen eggs costs a million dollars, a dollar is relatively worthless. If a bitcoin costs a million dollars, is it both worthless
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:55:39
Less than 22 million but more than 0
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:57:00
He’s right
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:44:44
??? More buyers on GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:23:41
10/10 response, thank you
