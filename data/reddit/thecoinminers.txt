Yes you can use the 10% off coupon on the 10 pack, coupon code is "red10ant" but it expires in 2 days.

We sell used and refurbished mining hardware that we buy and fix off of e-bay, forums, and other random places. Kind of like a bitcoin miner thrift shop.

Johnny, we just sent you a reply to your mail. Your replacement miner should be on its way on Monday, we are over nighting it to you. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Nope, we try our best to stay competitive. We searched several websites to find the best prices and priced accordingly. Thank you for taking the time to enlighten us. We will be changing the price tonight as soon as Management approves it

Thats why you never buy new, or direct from the MFG. We have been selling used and refurbished hardware with same day shipping for months now, and not had a customer complaint yet. Next time buy used.

About 18% less time than if you pay $70 for your miners from the other guys :)

Post 2 links to places where the gridseed miner is $40 cheaper and we might consider lowering the price. We're willing to bet $10 off on your order that you cannot.

This is not a "buy our hardware" post, this is a earn your own bitcoin post. Tonight we launched our 5% commission referral program in which you can earn 5% of the total sale of everyone you refer. Payments are made daily and are made in bitcoin.
