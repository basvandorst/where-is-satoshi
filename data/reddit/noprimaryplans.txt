Yuh. The same one which gave you a place to send your BCH before anywhere else. What's your point?

Well, you can say it's unfair, but there's never going to be a "fair" comparison. What about ETH's recent HF in prep for PoS? Dash's? I bet those are unfair, too? It's a new technology/industry and everything is being done for the first time. Whatever your feelings are on HF-ing the chain, BTC seems to be the only one with any hesitation.
What exactly would make a fair comparison if Bitcoin won't go near a HF for any reason whatsoever? My point is that no distributed network upgrade I can think of has ever completed in totality...it's a straw man argument.

Would love a recommendation too. The thing that drew me to Kraken is the cryptowat.ch charts they bought earlier this year. Was on bitfinex before they closed doors to the US for similar reasons. What else is there that doesn't look...inconvenient (like Bittrex, for example)? Maybe a simple interface is all i'm left with now?

Deja vu?

From the looks of it, that entire site (the chart app) runs separate from Kraken's usual backend. They just tacked on the "trading window" on the right which connects to Kraken's APIs and does its thing based on what the UI tells the Kraken's API. It seems that whatever they did to make cryptowat.ch work side-by-side with Kraken, they left the original app in-tact so it works pretty nicely, too....until it needs Kraken's API.
Edit: clarity clarity clarity clarity...

Kraken has an official statement on the issue: 




Not sure how old that doc is, but seems like they are doing something. I just joined and have been having the same pains. Hope this gets resolved soon.

Thanks for the tweet link.

Cash exists not to copy the ledger and claim ownership. Cash exists because segwit is an over-engineered solution to an already solved problem and we needed a backup just incase we need to scrap it and start over. Now we can see which solution works better in a way that's testing the only variable we care about here.... how should bitcoin scale. Good luck to your solution, sir.
Edit: grammar

I'd like to point out that Bcash's DDA hardfork was released and adopted within 2 weeks.
