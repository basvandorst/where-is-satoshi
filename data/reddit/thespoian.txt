A further (final) status update.  After telling them that the first tech was incorrect, within a few hours I got an almost identical email about how 2FA was now turned off (really) for my account.
Slightly surprised, it was true.  My account and bitcoins were there, and I moved them off platform to an other wallet without inicident.  The confirmations all cleared.
So, at least in my case, it doesn't appear to be fraud, but I'm unimpressed with the technical acumen and service response from CampBX.  On the plus side, there is someone there, listening to support desk tickets.
I can no longer recommend CampBX, but credit where credit is due, they did fix my prroblem in a timely manner, and once fixed, I had no further problems moving my bitcoins elsewhere.

Status update - they got back to me within 24 hours in response to my help ticket (good) saying they had fixed the 2FA issue.  Alas, I tried accessing it again within 3 hours of that email, and still no luck.
So, there is at least a human watching the support help desk and sending answers.  They just aren't correct first time.  :-/
I'll let reddit know how it turns out.  If they fix the problem, they should get the recognition.  If not, they should get that recognition too.

Good to hear.
I had used them a year ago, and had no problems with them before.  Volume was slim, but this was mostly to play around with.
I still have hope this is a technical snafu, they will fix it, and I will have access to my few bitcoins again.  But so far, the responses and behavior are ... worrying.

Fear + Greed are the two primary drivers of most speculative currency markets.
Apply either of those two forces, in various measures, as response to any set of events, and you get market behavior.
It's not a very satisfying answer, but is a pretty accurate description of "why."

Thanks for the list.  Haven't seen one this well organized before.  Good job.

Can you?  Sure, but it's not "easy."  Put it on par with being a good FOREX trader.

100 bits
For providing useful link

Not sure what you are asking by "How does this work?"  It's just a nice interface over the basic block-chain explorer.  Could you clarify your question a bit?

I hope you are getting free electricity.  That rate means you aren't making any money if you are paying for electricicty.
If the pool is crediting you with 0.1 GHash/sec you are getting more credit than you think you are, about 3 times more.
0.1 GHash equals 100 MHash.
As for what that means, it's the speed you computer and gpu are trying to help the pool solve the problem needed to claim the reward for mining that block of bitcoins.  Think of a giant game of tug-of-war, that speed (30 Mhash or 0.1 GHash) is how much "pull" you are contributing for your team.
In the scheme of modern miners, that isn't very much.  You will be rewarded by the pool in proportion to your contribution, which won't be much.

Did he freshly generated address have any transactions from or to it?  If it did, the transaction was present in the block chain to be looked up.  I don't know how BTC-e works specifically, but many exchanges do internal transactions "off the blockchain" that is, internally with their own accounting database, to speed up transactions for funds they know they control.  It's quite possible that when you transact outside of BTC-e, they have to payout/receive from a "common" hotwallet with a known address, that this site uses to look things up.
Either that, or BTC-e provides an API to query accounts on their system.

The original Satoshi bitcoin paper is pretty darn accessible and easy to read.  It's only 8 pages.
It's worth the read.
Skip any math or crypto you don't understand, and it's still worth your time.

Thanks.  No. no errors, but I glossed over a number of important details.  As I said,I was going for a quick, high-level primer most people could understand.  Glad you liked it.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:02:26
Thanks.  I have don't claim to have any deep insight here.  Nice to know someone waded through my wall of text.  ;-)  I just wanted to collect a set of jumbled thoughts and share them.  This way, in a few years, I can see how silly I was.  ;-)

I haven't used BTC-e, but I'm curious, how did they explain to you they would implement a "short position?"
I can't imagine any other way they *could* offer you a short position than to act as broker, rather than an exchange.
To short a stock, you have to borrow the stock, sell it (at what you hope to be a high price) then give it back by some date.  When you give it back you have to buy it (at the hopefully lower price) and pocket the difference.  But unlike a stock, you can't borrow bitcoins you don't have, just to sell them.
Sounds like you got screwed by BTC-e, but I'd look carefully at their terms, and how they define the "short" the offered you, as I don't see how an exchange could offer you a naked short position, without a huge amount of your cash in their accounts to act as collateral.
