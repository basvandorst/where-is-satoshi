When do we stop smiling? At $1000, $500, $50? Or do you smile even more because it is the biggest bitcoin buy opportunity  in years?

There are 2 possible scenarios: 1) P. Byrne, CEO and fearless leader of Overstock has really found "cold fusion on Blockchain" and will lead his company to a brighter future....which is highly doubtful. 2) P. Byrne, fearless leader is trying to prop up(pump) his stock which is down 66% this year. I would tend to believe the latter....It looks like an announcement similar to what we saw this summer where companies were renaming themselves as " XYZ furniture Company is becoming XYZ Furniture on Blockchain Inc ". I remain skeptical.

Value like beauty is the eye of the beholder. But maybe sometimes  the beholder wants to get rich quick.

For anyone who has not read ***1984*** from Georges Orwell here is a [link]( to Amazon to purchase and educate yourselves. Just imagine the same story but with a Philip K. Dick twist integrating 21st-century tracking technology on citizens.

Those are the reasons: 
 Because of cheaper valuations
Because slowly becoming mainstream .....
Because of growing institutional demand

If you notice the link to Amazon IS NOT an affiliate link. My intent for posting the link was not to get money but simply opening the younger generation eyes to an important piece of literature.

There is a fair amount of cynicism in the post if you haven t noticed.

Be thankful that Bitcoin did not lose 95% of its value like most altcoins. Be thankful that you are not working in a blockchain startup that ran out of money. Be thankful that your family is forgiving(hopefully).

All mainstream media articles promoting cryptocurrency are welcome. The more people realize that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies represent also a social revolution in the way we see money,value and the economy. Money is at the center of our lives not so much in conspicuous consumption as a means to build a better society by sharing the wealth that is locked and controlled by banks.

Cryptocurrencies Matter for Freedom. Bitcoin is ill-suited for e-commerce but other solutions are being developed. Stablecoins could be an option as digitized and tokenized currency in different forms(USD, euro) used to easily go from coins to fiat for instance. Merchants must pay their suppliers in fiat and require an easy "bridge " between coin and money. Google(and soon Apple )  through their embedded payment handler solution within the Chrome browser (or Safari) is addressing the issue of cryptocurrency payments. Building blocks to mass adoption while making cryptocurrency payment ubiquitous.

I should have added thay Cryptocurrency AND blockchain are changing the way we are transacting. Bitcoin is not only digitized money since money has existed in digitized form for decades. Bitcoin is a new form of currency accessible outside the traditional financial establishment. Hence a revolution rather than simple evolution. To borrow a term from fund managers bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are a new asset class, not merely money in a different form.
