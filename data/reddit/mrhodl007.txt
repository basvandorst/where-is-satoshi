That's not an attack on Bitcoin. That's Coinbase getting greedy. They don't care what Bitcoin does in terms of price so long as volume (trade activity) is unhinged. If they wanted to attack Bitcoin they'd remove it from their platform and not allow users to trade it.

@_date: 2017-12-22 16:25:53
I'm not surprised at all. But you can't say it's no ones fault. The value of the coin is determined by the market, which is controlled by humans. If everyone that held Bitcoin fell into a coma, the price would've risen given the fact that they held their coins (restricting available supply) thus bumping up demand for those on the sidelines trying to get in.
It's behavioral economics. The price is 100% tied to humans.
The flips side, X amount of people woke and decided to sell for whatever reason, maybe their horoscope said so, which began to know the price down because the supply increased, then a few more saw the price drop and they decided to sell, bumping it down even more, and then you have panic...

That didn't answer his question whatsoever.
Truthfully BTC has no value, other than what the next guy will pay for it. The $USD is the same, in theory, except for it's also insured by the US government if you decide to keep it in a bank (which you do so you, my friend, are insured upto $250K per institution). 
Which is what makes it more reliable that BTC. 
The $USD is also a currency, which BTC is not.

Yeah it will, but this volatility isn't new to the world. 
In January of 1999, Qualcomm was trading at $4.11. By December, it rose to $92.52. Almost a 2200% gain. 
It then crashed down to $13.
That's why people are nervous about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:18:36
It would not make a different because the markets are tied to the private sector. 
For example: If the government shut down tourism in National Parks, Amazon's stock price would be unchanged. Sure they may sell a few less Hydroflasks for young Timmy who was planning on hiking the Grand Canyon next week, but for the most part the financial markets are not tied to the public sector.

Can one single person move Qualcomm stock? No. The SEC regulates that stuff, kiddo. Plus there's a board of directors, legal filings, stockholders, with voting rights, etc.

@_date: 2017-12-06 00:12:54
There are arbitrage* opportunities for companies that get bought buy other companies
ie. Broadcom wanted to buy Qualcomm for $80 per share while Qualcomm shares were trading at $60 ($20 price difference), thus an Arbitrage M&amp;A Fund would swoop in, buy QCOM shares for $60 then wait for Broadcom to come in and give them $60
But Futures are a completely different animal, separate from the Bitcoin exchanges. There is no arbitrage, no funds, no nothing. The futures allows institution to bet on the future price of the coin, not the coin itself. That's all futures are. Just so happens that the markets they bet on, follow in their path MOST (not all) of the time.
Institutions will not be buying coins to hedge positions because they simply don't have a way of buying coins.

Just an FYI for people who are thinking of shorting. Unless you have secured a long position in BTC do NOT short sell. Which is called uncovered/naked shorting.
You have UNLIMITED liability and when the prices move and if they move up you are FCKED. You will have to rennter the market and buy back the coins.

Just curious, how did it kill the fiat? Until you can walk into 7-11 and buy a pack of swisher with a Bitcoin, I don't think it will ever kill the $USD
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:51:20
Deep pockets will be shorting most likely
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:55
Well in that case, any stock over $1 has killed the fiat
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:16:01
Going up, and up, and up does not mean it will replace anything. If that were the case, Berkshire Hathaway CLA shares would've replaced the dollar a long time ago.
People aren't going to want to hear this, but it will have to be adopted by governments and integrated into daily lives as a means of payment (aka a real currency) to replace our fiat currency.
But to the second part of your question, assuming it does replace the $USD, I don't think every company would have it's own coin. Maybe every country would, but I think we'd probably stick to one coin in the states.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:55:27

It's a college savings account that can grow tax-free when you use the money for college in 18+ years for the kids.
Throw $20 a week in each account, every week, for 18 years. With ~5% growth rate YoY, you can expect each kid to have ~$40k for college saved up. 
This is astronomically better than investing in the roller coast of BTC
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:43:08
No one is talking about predicting markets. It's about protecting profits, locking in gains, minimizing tax exposure, etc. Market timing is a totally different beast that, you're correct, has proven to be adversely effective to amateur investors

@_date: 2017-12-22 00:14:20
Or ppl don't sell and it drives the price higher at marginally faster rates than waiting for a sell off followed by a correctional dip to chase back the growth momentum it lost in the sell off. 
Now, what you meant to say, is by people selling off you can own more* but your original holding would be worth more if there wasn't a sell off.
Ya see?

@_date: 2017-12-06 00:01:29
And how are they going to do that? Institutions don't have a tool by which they can obtain Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:00:32
No, no, no, no, no.
First of all, you do not want everyone invested in crypto. Back in 2000 when dentists were quitting their jobs (dentists who already made a ton) to trade Yahoo stock because they can make 10% ROI DAILY, you begin to have bubbles.
Boomer's aren't investing their money because Bitcoin it a stupid investment for them. Boomers are in their 60's, 70's, 80's, who depend on their retirements to live. People who are invested in Bitcoin are teenagers and 20-somethings who are able to lose everything and rebuild. Boomers are not able to do that.
Lastly, the price of Bitcoin is not contingent on who knows about it, price is determined by the unbalance of basic supply and demand. Yes, 2chainz and Lil Pump has heard of Bitcoin, maybe not Riff Raff but I assure you the masses are aware of it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:16:37

Don't hire a CPA, you will pay them hundreds for something you can do in 20 minutes. 
Unless you've got property in all 50 states, millions of dollars in depreciating assets, 12 homes in different countries, 39 yachts, and an online business that only accepts credit cards from foreign country, then you don't need a CPA.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:34:59
Protect profits. People forget this is all speculation and worthless until the money from the sale hits your bank account.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:49:02
Here's a simple run down...
Every exchange you traded on will mail you a Form-1099, early in 2018 with all the trades you've done. Since you started this year (2017) everything you bought and then sold will have a short-term capital gain (taxed as ordinary income).
Hopefully the mailing address you put down on all those exchanges is correct because when they mail out a 1099 to you, they also mail one to the IRS. So make sure you have your copies so you can accurately report what they send you or your tax return (or lack thereof) will be shockingly different from what you expect.

I know which is why I revert back to my statement above. This volatility to crypto is unprecedented and not seen by any other investments, which is why you don't hear the words "Crypto's crashed"

@_date: 2017-11-29 20:03:36
Don't sell everything, but definitely sell to protect profits. Sell off enough to have x3 profits (or whatever you want) and then hold the rest. You'll lose less sleep and will be happier in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:24:35
Not true. It won't shoot anything up/down. 
Futures will minimize the volatility. Right now only amateurs have access. The futures market will lets institutions (aka experts) get a piece of the pie.
No more 20% swings in 30-minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:43:06
a pump-n-dump is where you buy (or already own) a very cheap and thinly traded stock, bid up the price to an insane amount, then offload you position. 
These happen to penny stocks all the time, but with a stock like APPL or NFLX would never happen unless they were cooking the books on the back end (see Enron).
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:47:24
I'd actually say he's spot on. It's finite and has a huge probability of collapse. But I'll continue to buy while it's a speculative investment.

a "crash" is defined by a 10% drop in 24-hours
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:36:59
Yeah... no. It's 10%. While that doesn't seem like a lot overtime, by definition "a 10% decline in value over 1 trading day" is considered a crash.
Black Monday (The start to the Great Depression) was a 12.8% crash. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:12:22
CME opening the door to futures WILL lead to ETFs down the line. But again your argument doesn't make any sense. The futures market will let experts (people with CFAs and billions of dollars to play with) invest in Bitcoin. Now once ETFs come along, they will have an IPO and be traded by investors that are skeptical of BTC now... I don't see where you think a fund company with only trade their ETF? You know ETF's trade intra-day on the OTC markets...

FDIC insures crypto exchanges but not the cryptos themselves. If you have $10k USD sitting in GDAX you would be covered if GDAX shuts down or runs away with your money. If it's hacked, tough luck, a class-action suit would come eventually. But if you had 1 BTC, and shit hit the fan, tough luck again.

We should listen to you more often. Seems like you're the only person to call this pullback
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:08:16
No, not really. So much money would pour into the Futures market from all different sides that it would be tough to manipulate prices. Not to mention with putting BTC on center stage it would make it harder for foul play to occur
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:27:02
It's speculation, and big money doesn't chase speculation. There will be a change but don't expect it to go up/down 10 fold when the futures open. It'll start to put BTC on a stable track one way or the other.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:57:52
Don't wait, just sell everything now and buy back on the dip that will come once it hit's 10k

FDIC is a form a insurance against another Great Depression. Infact, the FDIC was created after the depression to reinvest faith into banks (pun not intended). 
To dumb it down, if the banks fell on hard times financially, and didn't have enough cash on hand to cover what people held in their accounts, the government would cover you for upto $250k USD. Your bitcoin and crypto is insurance upto $0.
So... no, Coinbase could not buy infinite bitcoin with it's current cash on hand.

99% of people need to read this comment and get it tattooed on themselves.

How baked are you? 
Are you telling this kid to default on a personal, uncollateralize debt, or insinuating his country's currency will eventually collapse?

Nah, it'll dip a lot lower... like 10% more. We have yet to approach Black Friday pricing.

Bitcoin was founded on the premise that no single entity controls it - it's "the people's coin." There is no rule book or referees at the moment, so everyone is running around in a euphoric state thinking their string of code from a blockchain is worth $10K USD. When regulation comes in aka a large entity known as government, puts their stamp of approval, then finally that string of code has some validity. But people will not be stoked when Uncle Sam comes in to start cracking the whip

BTC will drop below $6000. Probably in the $5600-$5800 range (see candlesticks). Then once volatility and volume taper down it'll be on a more stable climb. Possibly $8k by year end (if lucky)

With enough gold I'll just buy you to protect me and feed me

I'll do it if people stop posting what they'll do "If Bitcoin reaches ..."

It will. It won't surge the price or kill it, it will even it out. You won't see these +/-25% swings in 24-hours anymore.

Other peoples stupidity is the telltale sign of a pullback. When my dentist in 2000 said he wanted to become a full-time day trader because he's up 20% on his MSFT stock this morning should've been a red flag.
