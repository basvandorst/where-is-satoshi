can make a new blockchain.info wallet with no email,
just a throw away wallet that will be used only once in the OS to sign a transaction, and then wipe the key from the wallet,
also it can be a smaller wallet and bigger wallet can safe at home or safety deposit box with a few copies or something

how can any connection to internet be risky in tails?
boot tails usb, make throwaway blockchain wallet, add key sign transaction delete key, turn off laptop,
where is the vulnerability? in which way can an advanced hacker or anything really attack me?
only ways i can see is if the laptop hardware is specially setup specifically waiting for such exposure, but a defense could be to use a smaller wallet on unknown laptops,
another attack i can think of is if the blockchain website is compromised or if there is a middle man attack that will send you to a different blockchain phising site that as soon as you put your key they have access.
really the way i understood blockchain worked is your key is safe with you and your password encrypts your key, and only the signed transaction is released to public but your key is always encrypted with the password, thats in the event of them saving the encrypted version of your key, but if you sweep it, maybe they could of had a backup of your encrypted key, and later when or if their encryption if compromised it could be your key could have been also

cold storage would be best, I'm trying to figure a way to use tails os on usb, with my private key, but to sign the transactions offline, and only go online to send them, im sure ill figure it out, not sure exactly how to do it yet though
edit basically i need to find a way to use blockchain.info offline to sign the transaction, this way my private key never gets added to there server, encrypted or not... hmmmm or any other way to sign the transaction while still offline on the tails os, this way my private key never gets uploaded to the internet in anyway whatsoever encrypted or not
