If I buy early, can I get pre-sale discounted prayers?

Don't store your coins on Coinbase or any other exchange regardless of your thoughts on SW.

It sounds almost as silly as letting national personnel and policy be set by democratic means and then expecting the public to have any idea what they're voting about.

Try logging into kraken or gdax. They're also reporting very low volumes. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:28:33
Volume is stuck because exchanges all crashed. Wouldn't be surprised if it drops more when they un-jam

I think he was writing from the point of view of most users. The ones who don't check into or or have any idea what a hardfork actually means other than that it may hurt their holdings and get scared by developers writing angry letters when they "give up on bitcoin." The mainstream. The people we are still working to convince to use our product so the rest of our efforts aren't wasted. The ones who actually matter, the ones we serve. 
And the ones who don't have the time or care to write something as clearly and consciously as At least someone is looking from the perspective that matters.

Didn't this happen a while ago?

AKA "I'm not that familiar with it, so I read something that sounded somewhat credible and am now asserting it as complete truth because it fits my world view"

That is a circular argument.  Essentially what you're saying is that you shouldn't invest in bitcoin because its value fluctuates.  Its value fluctuates because demand for it fluctuates.  The demand fluctuates because it is not the standard currency, and it is not the standard currency because you don't invest in it.
If we can break this cycle and usher mainstream usage, bitcoin will become incredibly more stable than fiat currency.  Idealistic probably, but we need to start somewhere

think alta-vista vs. yahoo vs. google.  Or AIM vs. Myspace vs. Facebook.  New technological paradigms always go through a few trial runs.

Famed hacker and internet securities expert [Dan Kaminsky]( among many others.  That's who.  
At least the core infrastructure of the bitcoin (the blockchain that actually runs the creation of bitcoins).  I suppose you could hack an individual's wallet (similar to vulnerabilities of other money systems like paypal or banking websites), or you could hijack a computer running a mining algorithm.  But you would have to hack the entire internet itself simultaneously if you wanted to have control of "printing up" bitcoins.

Honestly, I don't count out the idea that there are some major faults with the bitcoin format that we haven't conceived of yet.  It might be a hack, it might be a philosophical problem of digital money, it might be in the inefficiency of having a truly complete and total money supply one day.
But I think BitCoin is paving the way for the next better one.  This is a new concept, and there are always improvements to be made on a new concept, but these drawbacks will be hit equilibrium in the long run.  I'm not so attached to the BitCoin itself as much as the idea and benefits of it vs. the monetary system we've been using the last 50 years (or really any historical monetary system), which can be picked up and added down the line... possibly by one of these currencies you say are "over-saturating the market."

Had to chop up the quote a little bit to fit inside the character limit.  It was said by Roger Ver at a LeWeb 2013 panel on Bitcoin.

Just like they traded more USD for more Bitcoins.  And then probably traded that for drugs.

This is excellent.  If I had any BitCoins, or any cash to convert into BitCoins, or any desire at all to learn how to decorate cakes, I'd definitely sign up for your class.  But your effort is valiant and the internet appreciates every little bit!
