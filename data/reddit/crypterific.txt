Ecen 0.125  or 0.05 each of you guys would help out.
If i had the knowledge back in 2009 of bitcoin i would of bought 50,000 for 100 dollars.
i had to be in a overnight school with no internet,no youtube,  
i had spinal fusion surgury done 
2 titanium rods in 2014 and long time ago i just played videogames and didnt know anything about it until 2017. 
 instead of videogames and shared my wealth and even donated my btc.
if someone asked me for bitcoin id give 10000 to the world  and keep the rest of the 40000.
i now would of bought a mining farm managed with the best cooling technology.
 i would of bought each crypto hashing away in a solar powered/electric mansion in a heavily armored secured underground basement also finished off.
id have probably would generated so much bitcoin the price would of been triple by now.��

check out my post i predicted it��
@_date: 2019-06-23 02:07:57
i did it july 2017 at 1900 then predicted 4000 but dramactically went to 20,000 
 where in the phase of 2013 where it was 100 to 1000 so my therory 3100 to 31,000 this year.
so its back to where the price was in 2017 and maybe headed to 23,088 to 33,581 by 2020.
down to 24,094 to 37,794 in 2021.
19,275 to 54,211 in 2022.
42,254 to 83,188 in 2023.
its not impossible it happened in 2011 2013 2017 and 2019. then 2020 to 2022 will be like 2014 to 2016 and 2023 will be the 2013 all over again but bigger.

would btc crash again with segwit 2x  and would at this rate go to 10,423 by 2023.  if it says long term if it would be 10,423 bitcoin got more popular with more amd cards and new mining tech comes out to increase speed imagine the outcome 2023 15,000 a coin or 20,000 in another 3 years from then.  2026 is where i have my eyes on.
im an analyzer and i spend my time making spread sheets on paper and figure 200% or more increase every 2 years or 3 years 5 years another bitcoin frenzy when mining is global.  there will be a new way to mine bitcoin not scam cloud mining your own physical miner that is eco freindly if its possible and its possible for speed of light mining who knows.
