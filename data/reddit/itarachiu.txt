 - fully automated, you deposit the bitcoins, you buy SLL currency, you sell SLL currency for US dollars, then finally you withdraw the us dollars to your paypal account.
 - not automated, u need to wait a little to receive the funds.
Both of them are tested and I use them 1 week ago I think.

I think not. Both sites are pretty legit.

You can also go on bitcoin forum and exchange with somebody(a real personal account), beaware of scams, look at trust feedbacks, there are a few guys there on forum which exchange btc to paypal if u are scary to get your account blocked.

Nothing crazy, I made this 1 year ago and today I saw is actually visited by 100 users per day so I decided to add more  currencies because the old one was only for usd.

Yes I know, I need to fix some widths and fonts in order to work properly. I added all currencies possible, 4 or 5 are missing.

Scroll down and click on "SEE ALL CARDS" button. There will be filtered by your country a list with sites available for your region.
Edit: A friend of mine has a SpectroCoin card and he is using the card to convert BTC to real money, he is using the card into an ATM to make withdrawals. Also the same card can be used at POS machines or into online stores like Amazon... like any credit/debit banking card.
