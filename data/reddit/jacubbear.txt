Yeah coinbase ate my humble bundle coins last week. Luckily humble bundle had great support and a day or so ago the games were added to my account. :)

They just ate my coin because the Coinbase wallet expired before the transaction was confirmed. Thanks blockchain :D

That's just the market forces at work baybeeeeee! The market ain't buying racist shitheels that are bad for business anymore, boohoo.

But there also the hassle of getting your coins from fiat. I'm not saying it's a hurdle people wouldnt overcome but going paycheck&gt;bank&gt;exchange&gt;wallet&gt;purchase 
Is a hard sell when most people just do paycheck&gt;bank&gt;purchase with debit 
Not to mention the huge amount of different exchanges with varying levels of user friendliness, lack of good coin wallets on IOS (at least when I was using an iPhone a while back) really puts up hurdles for entry, especially for non tech inclined people.

I mean, the only way I personally buy records will be from vinyl presses or the occasional Bandcamp artist whose stuff is too obscure to torrent/ I really want to support the artist. I'm far too cheap to buy regular mp3s. On Bandcamp I know 90% of my money goes to the artist compared to the shit percents artists get from other platforms. And with vinyls you get a physical press of the music, an enlarged album cover, and most of the time unique liner notes. 
I also have a google play music subscription for anything streamable. 
Bomb the music industry! Was a band that figured out early they'd never make money from selling albums. They made their music cheap and easy to access and embraced a DIY attitude that really let them be a really unique band free from influence of big labels and the industry's pressures.

Yeah exactly! Lots of no name emo bands and stuff have gotten my support thanks to Bandcamp. I can't stress how great Bandcamp is

Well, I agree with your point, but you have to think of the markups as the cost of dealing in such a risky business. Mailing drugs is really fucking risky. I wouldn't do it if a super high mark-up wasn't involved in it. Why would you risk so much for no extra profit than just selling to someone you know?

I used 0.0000518 BTC as well for a 192 byte txn. It's been almost three hours :/ I wish circle didnt use such a low miner fee

Mainly want to clear this up, your job pays you directly in bitcoin? If so that's pretty cool

What the fuck kind of crazy conspiracy theory is this?
