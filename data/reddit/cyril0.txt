OK OK... how do I find it?  Where is the info I need to read so I stop looking foolish?  and thank you

I see but if this is happening on a priovate network then do I really need this level of trust?  This all can go on in a LAN

Couldn't a webapp be made?  Why does the wallet need to be installed on the phone?  A webapp can use the camera, local storage (to a degree) and processing power.  Thoughts?

Not really, not in enterprise also decentralized could just mean a local cluster where each workstation runs part of all the servers.  I'm imagining thin boot software that handles hardware and network.  Advertises itself and then maybe initiates a dhcp server or something.  Next workstation comes up and boots from the first workstation, again thin os, and advertises cpu ram and storage and so on until all the machines are booted that are to be part of the system, say 200 workstation at Acme's downtown office.  Then a hypervisor is started on top of this mesh cluster and in that hypervisor all the network's servers are started. Either as applications in containers or full virtual machines.  Here is where I see it getting interesting.  We could then run a vdi client on each workstation and have virtual machines running for each worker in the mesh and an rdp or citrix or whatever client running on the metal of the workstation and connects to its dedicated vm in the mesh.  
So imagine 200 workstations each with 2 cpus 1 TB of storage and 4GB of ram.  You could provide and over provision the heck out of this thing.  The whole network would have so many resources and everything could be handled as a shared workload and the storage could be 3 - 1 or 4 - 1 redundancy and still make financial sense.  Companies could get rid of their servers in favour of getting better use out of workstation and the real problem of storage and trust has already been solved.

Only if a fix is even possible.  Open source projects can fix errors in code but if the entire concept is flawed then no fix can ever be invented.  If the blockchain grows and the complexity for solving blocks grows exponentially then the price of each transaction will ballon and the network, open source or not, will fail.

It explained that digital signatures exist and what purpose they serve but not how they work.  Can someone point me to an article that will show me the mechanism they use in a reasonably simple way?  I understand prime numbers and I get how they encrypting works but I don't udnerstand why the public key would allow one to validate the coin that had been encrypted with the private key.

Possibly dumb question but what is stopping people from inserting all kinds of junk in the blockchain and inflating its size unnecessarily?  Could the blockchain be made to huge to be practical?  Can non bitcoin stuff be filtered out somehow?

What of big time bitcoiners or even groups of bitcoiners could send bitcoin back to people they don't even know to stimulate the use of bitcoin. Buy something on azon with bitcoin get 5% back from the community. When retailers see how much more clients they gey maybe they will adopt the policy themselves.

I was thinking about this over the weekend.  Could it be possible to use this technology and apprioach but also for cpu and memory?  I ask because I can envision a corporate network where the server infrastructure was replaces by the workstations running a mesh hypervisor with virtual machines floating about the mesh.  SO storage, cpu and ram of the virtual machines would sit on top of all the company's worstation simplifying the infra greatly.

I can afford to run a full node.  I have esx running in my house with a 30x10 connection, I have tons of storage and an ubuntu server as a VM.  The problem is I have absolutly no idea how to run a node.  Suggestions?  Also as for incentivize the running of nodes, couldn't running a full node come with a donation button where people running nodes can be tipped in bitcoin?  Couldn't we just set it up so tipping is automatically split between every full node equally?  This is going to need to happen sooner than later.  Honestly as fog computing grows tipping, in going to become a must.

The Krugman effect: The opposite of the shit he spews will always be true.
@_date: 2015-01-29 19:09:09
Why would this be taken down?
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:35:54
I was wondering since each transaction is derived from previous transaction being run through an algorithm couldn't we drop much of the legacy content on the ledger?  I mean we could keep it in a few places but the need to run a full node would be decreased.  Why am I wrong?

I was just there last Thursday and bought my first coin.  Thanks guys.
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:04:13
OK thank you.

Exactly, the goal would be to easily shift workloads depending on the time of day or the corporate needs.  Run workstations then run servers then run backups all on the same group of machines.  You could even sell the resources online when you aren't using them.

I will look in to finding a better alternative.  Are people still mining these days?
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:36:11
Follow up question.  Why 10 minutes?  Couldn't the difficulty be adjusted so it takes one minute or less to increase the number of transactions?  I am certain that has a whole slew of ramifications but I don't know what they are.
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:50:56
Hmm, now you've got me wondering if bitcoin isn't a partial solution for large transactions and settlements while other coins can be used for small fast ones.  I wonder how big bitcoin can get without increased block size?  Could there be another way of speeding up transactions without changing the protocol or the block size?  What about using some other chain to handle many transactions and then shoehorning that result in to a block?  I realize I am getting off topic
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:39:32


OK so a 1MB block can only store a certain number of transactions (typically 3) so bigger blocks speed things  up.  But couldn't we also speed things up by making the blocks easier to mine?  More blocks mined more transactions confirmed.
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:15:29
OK so what is a block? and why do small blocks mean fewer transactions?
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:46:06
Well shoot! You just made the blocksize debate a lot more complicated for me.  Awesome!  Increasing the block size will cost the miners so they (who are the work horses) are disincetivized to adopt larger block sizes which is why it isn't happening.  That makes  a lot of sense now.
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:33:19
Thank you, the first paragraph was a good start to what I was looking to understand.  A block is a collection of transactions that have been successfully verified by miners.

Sorry for all the responces in individual threads but I figured I'd keep my subsequent questions seperated so others could more easily follow.  Thank you for answering btw
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:12:05
That isn't true.  You can have a decentralized ledger without needing to have the full ledger on every node.  
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:35:42
Couldn't part of the chain be archived so that there isn't a real need to run full nodes. I mean if you can go get it when you need it why does everyone need it all the time? Can't an arbitrary cut off be made then a checksum value for the data archived be used to represent that data unless it is specifically needed for some verification purpose down the road?
@_date: 2015-08-10 12:23:17
BItcoin, isn't just money but rather it is cash money.  I think this aspect needs to be highlighted.  Bitcoin is liquid, that seems to be the true value proposition.  I know eCash is taken but maybe smart cash, or iCash for apple people.

@_date: 2015-11-10 23:48:54
Wouldn't regular people use something akin to credit with those banks taking risk on transactions knowing how much each user had available in their accounts and rapidly authorizing transactions and then settling with other major banks in bulk at set schedules?
