Well fees currently are about $35 per transaction on the bitcoin blockchain right now, so even if your investment is worth $36 right now, you can only spend $1 dollar of it.

They've said Ln network will come in 18months+, they've been saying it's really ready since 2015, will it ever come?
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:32:41
Well currently if you only have a few cents worth on bitcoin, you're going to have to hold it regardless

Think you may need to brush up on you comedic skills a little bit ��

Bitcoin is dead! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:32:57
Don't you have to open up a channel and deposit all the btc you think you'll use before hand
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:42:54
Same but $35 to move my own money is a bit ridiculous, considering dumping my btc for some other coins tbh
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:38:33
Yeah pretty much, wait...'only losing $35', wish I was as chill as you about losing $35 hahah
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:50:11
Don't think it's gonna tank

Soon to reach 500,000 unconfirmed tx too!

That's what everyone else is doing, sometimes it better to jump ship rather than go down with it

Been outed as a known hoax
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:05:26
Shame you can't spend/move it because the transaction fees are astronomical

Roger has done sweet fuck all, he's probably scrolling this feed laughing at some of the shit people are saying on this sub, pull yourselves together. Let bitcoin thrive regardless of which side you're on

Tips $1, you have -$14 in your account 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:39:02
Fees imo

Crash coming at 10k, wait to buy at low, it's stupid to buy on the peak
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:40:06
It's a buyers market, it will take a few hits but that wall can be broken easily I reckon
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:12:19
There's only 55k bch being held on coin base, even if they all dumped them that's practically nothing compared to how much it will increase due to exposure
Disclaimer: I hold both btc and Bch 
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:20:54
Old news it hit 6666usd
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:06:44
Absolutely 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:33:52
Your comment just goes to show how much you actually know. First of all the fork happened on august 1st. That means only people who hold bitcoin before august 1st actually have BCH, why your talking about coinbase signing up new users idk. Second of all, coinbase (GDAX) isnt the only exchange, people who know anything about crypto would just move over to another exchange to access their BCH on another exchange. The fact that you think most customers have one bitcoin is laughable. You're using words such as 'probably' and 'If', all of these things tell me that your not sure what you're  actually talking about, please educate yourself before commenting!

We've been rising ~500 usd a day, the close we get to fork the higher it will go, think 9k is possible
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:56:50
Well, without community backing, 2x wouldn't even get past the proposal stage
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:58:31
Isn't this already the minimum?
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:55:49
How so? It's remained close to its all time high for a good while (5600-6100). If it wasn't backed then it would have crashed way lower after the btg fork. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:06:02
Which ones will you be dumping?
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:48:55
2x is backed by most of community and the miners too. 2x is already expected to float around 1-2k, people love their free coins, to the moon!
