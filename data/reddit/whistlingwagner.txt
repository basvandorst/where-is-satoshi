yet 10x more volatile. No responsible person would recommend their friends and family to place more % of their investment portfolio in bitcoin than cash or gold.

I despise the monetary policy of the Federal reserve like every one else but at least the dollar doesn't experience 10-20 intraday drops. Society would fucking become unhinged if that happened.

Don't think people will stop using bitcoin or stop adopting it. However that doesn't mean people wont lose a shit ton of money along the way. Lots of blood was spilt during the DotCom bubble when everyone and their grandma was pouring money into companies that didn't even have earnings. The chart of Bitcoin right now is literally vertical. There will be a reversion to the mean but how steep or shallow it will be no one knows. All I know is that I live in the suburbs in Louisiana and I can't tell you how many times in just the past month I've heard random bros and even coworkers talking about buying bitcoin. These are people who have absolutely no background in trading, finance, or history of doing so. Bitcoin I think is here for the long term but the ICO market seems to be having classic bubble behavior right now. Tread carefully. Don't get emotionally attached because at the end of the day Bitcoin is a pure speculative play.

45% ain't a dip lol. That's a correction bordering on a crash.
