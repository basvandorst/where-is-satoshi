Only few signals left before we take off.  Bear trend is showing weakness.

You know what?  On 1d chart, 100ma is moving under 50 ma.  This is positive sign.

Not going under, could be or maybe but 100 and 50 is closing the gap.

If u look at feb 6, its not done falling but suddenly it pumps up, can anyone explain?

So 8kish volume a few hours ago and turned 44k and those i think r sellers.

Bears will eat you.

Is there ongoing regulations or something atm? Any Gov't interference in this very moment?  Any event that cause this non stop selling?

This climb up again from 8.90k to 9.18k from 5 min chart,  In 1 min chart I think this is by wave.

MACD and RSI cools off but didnt go further down.  I have good hopes on this.

Just went out of 9141 resistance, next test is 9287\-9407.
@_date: 2018-04-30 22:51:16
Im afraid its going down.  Cant break the resistance and a whale doesnt want to fill anymore.  Anyway its the whale who created these huge spikes at random 5min chatrs that creates the momentum.

melt down yesterdey from 9.7 to 8.6 but broke the 2nd line of resistance out of 3 in just a day, looking good.  I think we'll retest 9.2sh again.  I think those fomos from yesterday saw the weakening bear of yesterdays at 8.6 and enters the market again.

Why its always that 1hr spike always create the huge climb? Could anyine explain?
