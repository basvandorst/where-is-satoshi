You can’t convert crypto to CAD on Coinbase. Use Quadriga.

I'm clearly missing something here. What benefits does this provide over current banking systems? How is it any different other than calling money something else and using a blockchain for the sake of using it? Why do we need banks at all with crypto other than loans?

If that bank had BankOfXCoin though, you'd be doing just that, putting your entire portfolio in one coin.
The FDIC is a government organization built on heavy regulations, something most crypto supporters are not in favour of.
If you're worried about volatility, you have no business being in crypto. It's a speculative market, that's the nature of it.

That makes sense I suppose, thanks. I know very little about banking other than what you learn from using them day to day.
With that said I definitely think blockchain has the potential to benefit the institution, just not as sure about the end customer. Only time will tell, I'm sure people much smarter than me are working on it ;)

I agree, it was mostly just to help me learn. Looking for the benefits of this approach mostly. My first reaction would be to shop around for new banks, so I was curious what other people's thoughts were.

Go to a different bank that doesn't force you to use their proprietary crypto asset?

Nobody claimed they’d read every line of source. Having it available means it can be audited, and nefarious code will be found eventually. A closed source system you operate purely on faith.
What “crazy environment it needs to be compiled in” are you referring to? This is a load of shit. If this is an electron app, you need NPM. Wow, a whole package needs to be installed!

What motivation would a person have to still use that bank in this instance?
