Lol. Maybe check that chip on your shoulder a bit bud.

It's an idiotic thing to say. You can learn interesting and important things from everyone you meet.
The world is a huge and complex place. Having a lot of mental capacity for analytical tasks or scoring well on IQ tests doesn't make up for the *profound* inadequacy of scale of one brain vs all the information out there in the world.  In the grand scale we're all largely ignorant, no matter how intelligent we are by some measure. The good news is everyone is bringing different knowledge and experience to the table, so collectively we can overcome that. 
But of course, that requires getting your ego out of the way instead of having a condescending view of other people.

A lot of people here have the attitude that if you run into trouble with law enforcement, you must deserve it. They don't imagine they'll ever be in one of these situations.

The US boomers are one of the most lucky cohorts alive. They benefited from the US's post war economic boom, dramatic real estate appreciation over the long haul, and a network of strong social institutions that provided many direct benefits. There were some speed bumps (h/t OPEC), and things weren't so rosy for folks that weren't WASPy, but on the whole they enjoyed favorable economic winds like few humans past or future ever will.

We paid down the debt to almost nothing during the 90's.

What have you accomplished?

Nope. Read David Graeber.

So you think it's great to keep petty resentments to yourself. Great. Do that.
Why do you believe 1. what the original article is talking about are petty resentments vs sexual discrimination you do not experience, and 2. that your attitudes regarding grievances are normative for other people?

This is a pile of BS. While anyone can *learn* the skills involved to get a job in tech in general, and cryptocurrency in particular, that's not the same thing as people choosing to hire you, choosing to take your pull requests and issue reports to open source projects seriously, choosing to include you in the many various backchannel venues that are ultimately critical to building a successful professional network.
If you believe tech is some pure meritocracy, you are simply delusional.
I've been in this biz for a while now, and I've seen every form of ugly bigotry you can imagine. Go talk to any woman that's tried to raise capital from angels and VCs. The stereotype that the best person to fund is an arrogant, smart, kid that dropped out from the ivy league is *still* very strong.

Yes, as usual folks here are being smug about bitcoin while not knowing utterly basic things about how our banking system works.
The treasury department sold some big chunks of bonds for ordinary/banal reasons, and the liquidity in the overnight interbank lending market went below a threshold that triggers this. It's no big deal.

He's an insufferable ass in person. Like absolutely horrid.
Fooled by Randomness had a valid core point, but so have a million other people with similar books. His performance as a quant was more mediocre than he brags about.
In recent years he's been isolating himself in math of his own creation, which is pretty much the textbook definition of a crank.
