Well the problem doesn't go away by ignoring it. Segwit would help but batching seems like it would have a broader long term impact for them, i.e. 1 input many pay outs vs. 1 to 1 or 2 to one. 
It would require users get used to up to say 30 minutes for normal withdrawals and then they could always Upcharge for express withdrawal. 
Its never as simple as people think it is trying to upgrade a plane in flight though.

Yes but all tethers are issued by the tether company to exchanges as a starting point. Usd must goto tether reserve account before tethers are issued. Only exchanges can participate in this process. So two options exist, exchanges sent a billion without due diligence or exchanges are conspiring to perpetuate fraud for some unknown reason (put on your tin foil hats)

If they don't care about decentralization then their going to be really disappointed to find out visa will remain superior for transactions for years to come and Server client network hierarchy with sql databases will out perform any peer to peer network architecture for years to come. I still use visa daily because I have 30 day interest free loan the points I earn pay for a vacation every year. You seems to be confusing short term speculation with unproven technologies as a threat to what is a 9 year track record of being the most secure, decentralized, immutable and censorship resistant blockchain. Un-related in my opinion.

@_date: 2018-01-17 15:09:14
try 2 years was the last one. But that was after a catastrophe. That was during a time when alts didn't exist. There was one or 2 exchanges. THere were &lt; 200k subscribers to this sub with virtually no new subscribers for months.(versus 2-3k new subscribers daily right now) There was never news coverage and when there was it was ALWAYS negative as can be(MTgox and silk road). 5 years would mean the experiment is over and declared a failure. 5 years in crypto is 15 in the real world. 2 years again would mean the same thing.

@_date: 2018-01-30 22:30:54
The fraud involves 6 exchanges the investigation will expand to all of them. They will be shut down temporarily if not permanently for perpetuating a fraud via criminal negligence or out right conspiracy. Either way they won't be do anything while its sorted out.

Speculation is present in any market....dare I say all markets are purely speculation that the underlying company, commodity or asset is going to be more valuable in the future. Speculation isn't inherently bad. I could actually turn that argument on its head and just point out its been a speculative market since 2009, look were it is and where its headed.
I agree there are certainly many crypto assets that are over valued. But I don't see Bitcoin in that category given it is the defacto most decentralized, immutable and secure public block chain. Unless the inherent value in that evaporates completely then Bitcoin is under valued.

Wait until you find out there is no monetary incentive to run a bitcoin node. Joking aside the idea is if you are earning .001 dollars per transaction and you routing 1,000,000 per year that its still profitable.
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:56:59
I don't understand what you're trying to say. Running a node is a bit different than making a Bitcoin transaction. Mainly because as a prerequisite you habe to advertise your node and how much you can move through your channels. Effectively an advertisement that says Hey check out my hot wallet over here. The more your advertising, the more incentive attackers have to target your node. The major differentiator isnt the attack surface, most people don't advertise 24\7 they have a hot wallet at this ip address with x balance.

I like ether as a project but you have to be quite blind to see that the temporary concession by the eth miners to bump blocksize to relieve network congestion is at a best temporary. Think about it, it required an emergency change because of one Kat app? just 1. Sharding is a 18 months off earliest and at this point highly theoretical.

You do know that if nobody makes efficiently using blockspace a number 1 priority then no scaling methods will work. The community, meaning all the participants in this peer to peer network, have a continuous responsibility to be good stewards over the limited resource which is the shared block chain. This means demanding of yourself and each other that this limited resource isn't taken for granted. Which it is being taken for granted. Many peers in the network are being wasteful. There is no technical solution to solve waste. Its a conscious decision the network participants must make and it must make it now. And it must continue to make it when schnorr signatures arrive and it must continue to make it when LN arrives etc etc etc.

You aren't excepting reality either. If 50% of blocks are wasted space (as an example) increasing that block doesn't change the ratio of wasted space to efficiently used space. You still end up with 50% wasted space in a larger block. Waste doesn't scale. Either bitcoin participants will decide efficiency is top priority or bitcoin will never scale because wasted doesn't scale. 
Efficiencies on the other hand always scale. Take a fictional 50% efficiency, at 1mb thats 1.5  mb at 2 its 3mb(triple the original size) etc etc etc.

A peak and a crash isn't new bitcoin has done this countless times. I wanted to know why the situation after the crash (two year bear market) would ensue. I don't think the market conditions are the same nor are the fundamentals. We have multiple exchanges that cannot even open accounts fast enough indicating growth hasn't stopped. There has not been a major gox catastrophe...so why doesn't the market rebound like all the other times rather than enter a long term bear market.

I honestly don't think there is any actual competition with bitcoin. Ethereum is its own niche and has been struggling to find its killer app for a few years(while also facing major scaling hurdles of its own). The rest are niche utility alts for the most part that are going to be very important experiments in the long run. Most will fail in the market place but there will be gems of innovation gleaned from the destruction. Most of the "investors" are absolutely fomo-ing right now and throwing money at anything, this will make a few rich and most will get stung. Fundamentals have left the building (if they were ever there) when it comes to alts. The bitcoin forks are money grabs, most don't even have a client and you can't even claim your "funds". Bcash is a software development project without developers. It exists to prop up asic boost and it too shall pass.

Not really banks try to avoid unnecessary risk exposure and avoid additional regulatory burden. These are extremely expensive. Plus what you are considering here is they have an ability to even comply with KYC/AML, which from what I can tell unless its voluntary by the user they will not know from whom or to whom a transaction is going, by design.  
Now if they charge a fee they can't charge more than what the market will bare and the market will be competitive. 


There is no scenario where there won't be small and medium size nodes also on the network. So you have the option of a longer route through smaller nodes for more fee and more privacy or a shorter route through larger nodes with less fee and less privacy. Businesses like individuals will only need a handful of channels open they will not need to be mega nodes themselves.

Full segwit adoption would bring damn near 2x transactions throughput. Thats not my claim thats how it works witness data discount.(do your own homework) Batching is more difficult to measure so low balled it to a negligible improvement though we know coinbase does hundred of transactions oer day that could be batched so its impact would be more than negligible. 50% seemed reasonably conservative. The scenario again was everyone adopting these efficiencies. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:46:51
Your right but they have to still make the decision to devote their sparse development hours on an unproven malleability fix vs. using a proven one. Its fun that they'll even have to think about it and will ultimately end up not doing it out of spite only to their continued detriment.

I like the ETH project but 'significant' is relative. Its still quite low in the grand scheme of things and the network was brought to its knees by novelty digital kittens.

No thats not metcalfes law at all. Metcalfes law isn't the official measure of value it is one framework proposed there is no official method its a new asset class. "shares" aren't really applicable here in the same way you don't own a share of gold. You can own shares of a fund that buys and holds gold but you don't own a share of "gold" the element on the periodic table. You can even own grams and ounces of gold in the same way you can own 1 satoshi or 1 whole bitcoin but neither of these accurately represent the notion of a share.

That's not what anecdotal means. Anecdotal would be me saying i know someone that was robbed and shot their assailant without and actual corroborating facts. Those are all factually supported events documented by journalists and police precincts. Surely you understand the difference.
Fbi publishes all the gun crime statistics you could possibly want. It is without question that gangs and drug activity account for majority of it and if you remove suicide then the chances of being involved in a gun related crime are slim to none. Something like 10x more likely to be killed by a drunk driver.
This isn't surprising since there is no other country with the gang and drug activity. No other country shares thousands of miles of borders with a narco state that has no less than 3 major cartels earning more than one hundred billion per year pumping drugs into the streets of usa. So Yea please find another country with these circumstances and compare like for like stats.

I can't even deconstruct this statement enough to reply, its so baity. What is a non-shitcoin with merit? I've got nothing against litecoin or ethereum, I don't think there will be one blockchain in the future there will be hundreds of thousands of them. I do fully anticipate Bitcoin will be a top tier blockchain because it remains the most censorship resistant, immutable, decentralized and secure public blockchain on the planet. So long as that doesn't change, its value proposition doesn't change.

You've given a clear example of nothing. Litecoin faces IDENTICAL scaling challenge bitcoin does. Same as ethereum same as any other public blockchain. Litecoin is cheaper than Bitcoin so long as its DEMAND remains low enough. Shifting to litecoin to transact only proves the fee market works, low value bitcoin transactions will shift to lower value block chains. When litecoin gets to expensive for those transactions they'll shift to dogecoin or whatever the fuck coin.

Well I can' tthink of a good reason you'd want to allow any channel partner to close all your channels. It would make more sense then to take 100000 sats and split them between 4 channels that can then be used to re-balance each other when a channel is getting depleted. Then if a channel partner closes the channel your not cut off from the network you still have 3 channels.

@_date: 2018-01-07 21:09:42
Well maybe we are talking about different things. There is the scaling problem which is the perpetual problem that never gets solved. Then there is the problem of the current fee situation. My words were addressing the current fee situation. We can relieve fee pressure RIGHT NOW by adopting existing features of the protocol as a whole community. 
THe scaling problem, that is never fully solved is there fore not solved merely by batching and segwit. For that we will need to use all availabe means. Schnorr sigs, LN, root stock, side chains, drive chains and all manner of things that I don't know about or havent been discovered yet. And yes blocks will also need to increase eventually. There is almost no one, that thinks blocks should never increase. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:25:03
WHere did I say it couldn't happen, my assertion was IF, and its a fucking huge if(think about the money left on the table), it wouldn't be the end of anything.

Yeah but I get credit card points that pay for vacations and cash back.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:24:34
1) simple napkin math time:
Last 50 blocks average 2118 tx per block
Lets assume modestly a 50% efficiency increase between batching and segwit.
2118 * 1.5 = 3177 tx per block
3177 - 2118 = 1059 tx more per block
Lets stick with an average of 144 blocks per day @ 10 mins per block.
144 x 1059 = 152621.28
Current backlog is 140k tx ( 
That means in one day just that 50% efficiency would clear the backlog and blocks wouldn't be full any more.
2) I said it would solve the problem of fees right now, I didn't say it would solve scaling for all time. Scaling will never be solved. Its a process not a destination. If you want centrally managed monetary policy use fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:47:22
so your final answer is bubble chart?
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:25:25
No I mean people wasting space by not adopting segwit or batching. Hell there are still people using uncompressed signatures. If people are ok with not using the shared resource of the blockchain efficiently there is no scaling that will every help waste and inefficiency. There is a reason manufacturing plants have entire departments dedicated to eliminating waste. Because businesses and peer to peer distributed network architectures will never scale with rampant waste.

Well the exchange would be shuttered until it was settled probably so I HIGHLY doubt it takes three years given the money backing Coinbase and they lose $3M per day they are closed.(Realistically the insurance policy probably stipulates response times) That being said you probably eat the difference because that is what third party risk does.

I know that you're trying to be a lawyer on the internet even though you have no experience at all because if you did you would know that subpoenas exist in both civil and criminal cases and getting a subpoena just means that you need to provide some sort of either testimony or evidence in a civil or a criminal court case. and again it doesn't mean you're a suspect it just means they need you to provide some information to Aid in some case okay. 
Now where did you get the information that the government is actually rummaging through any of their files as far as I know there's no evidence they even replying to this subpoena because again there's no jurisdiction here and they do not have to respond or they could just respond with a giant f*** you but either way there's no court compelling them to respond they don't answer to any US court a court can't force them to respond

Now what is interesting is I can today, swap btc for L-btc and then send that LBTC to any number of wallets and swap back to any number of btc wallets.. The chain analysis breaks as soon as I do that because Confidential transactions is deployed in L-btc tx. Assuming I've used Tor for all of this I've just cleaned my coins quickly and cheaply.

Im not going to tell you how to prove your thesis. The whole point is you should have proved it before you started claiming security vulnerabilities.

You can opt out of over draft tho it's actually required by law to allow opt out so your transactions will be denied at pos rather than allowed
It's pretty simple to avoid overdraft.

I don't really have time to explain this to you. If they can't verify the source and destination of funds they won't do it. They can track movements of HD wallets in the blockchain. They can't track the movements of LN. If you don't think they are tracking you start moving your coins to/ from gambling sites and see what happens with your account

Meaning big value transactions cab only route through higher funded nodes.
I suspect there will be enough transient nodes of all sizes that make even this tracking difficult to make assumptions about.


How's that gonna work if you cannot determine if there are 1 or 20 hops? Wouldn't this also route alterations impact the checksum
Wouldn't any of these actions become obvious to the network and result in node bans? I suspect where there is Intel there counter Intel running as well. So not only do they have to pull off the attack they have to avoid detection. Seems like diminishing returns here.

Ethereum is more centralized governance model, as seen by the DAO fork. Being more centalized has the advantage of being able to evolve faster. Bitcoin has features in the protocol right now where if universally adopted blocks would be half full by morning if network participants adopted the current transaction efficiency enhancing features that are available in the protocol.
4 Separate teams are working on LN implementations right now. Do you know what their number 1 problem is? They can't find the talent to hire more people. Anybody busy solving tough problems can tell you the only way to move faster is to put more qualified people on the task of solving the problem. See here:

@_date: 2017-12-18 14:37:53
Yeah like you, there are many people joining the recent frenzy/hype cycle so network is filled with transactions. My advice would be to install wallet software that allows custom fee. Send a low fee transaction, maybe it gets mined in a week maybe not at all. No harm in trying. The other option is wait out this current tidal wave. 
It sounds bad but we are waiting for wallet adoption of segwit which is going to be providing temporary relief until a blocksize increase and or lighitning adoption next year.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:01:13
Lol, dude they charged $15 dollars to sell me a Bitcoin at a thousand dollars each, your presenting this like it's privilege for them to sell me the same bitcoin at 18k  fees. Same service, 15x fees give me a break, this is on top of the spot spread you know they have. Now if this is common practice as you put it, i didn't attest to that but not scaling their fee structure when the price goes ballistic is callous imo. But this is subjective admittedly.
But again back to the point, the only thing important here, they have no problem profiting off the same customers they're screwing by choosing to delay implementation of segwit.

Your missing the point, bigger blocks which is what you are suggesting as solution would be filled with spam transactions because they would be cheap. The bigger the blocks the cheaper the transaction fee the more spam you get. Same thing with email spam as computing power /bandwidth decreases each year spam has increased. 1MB or 10 MB spammers would still spam until blocks were full. Thats the nature of spam.

There were major signs like slow or no withdrawals and eventually stopped all deposits. There were people warning of major problems on the mtgox exchange (no money left etc) the crowd fervor from high prices was loud as well. It was definitely in the middle of "its a new paradigm". After the crash and exchange implosion it was depressing almost nobody got out completely unscathed and then for more than a year any media coverage was very negative, its dead its over it failed, scandal, scam, fraud. Good news of any kind seemed to come once a quarter. And was usually squashed by a China ban pretty quickly. 
How was it different than today. 
1) tons of regulated and compliant exchanges today  vs. fly by night operations and you couldn't even buy bitcoin with a credit card at all back then
2) major major players/institutions involved today, almost no body took it seriously in the corporate world after the mt. gox implosion
3) regulatory frameworks in place domestically and abroad vs. Total uncertainty 
4) massive daily main stream media coverage almost all positive vs. Rare media coverage almost all negative i.e. drugs, silk road, ponzi, fraud, etc.
5) Network effects had only begun taking root  vs. today you can actually see it growing every day before your eyes, google trends, reddit subscriber trends, overhearing it in public conversations, coinbase account growth trends, transaction growth trends, market price trends.

Well, we will need both have no doubt about it. For the immediate future there are enough fixes and updates in addition to increasing blocksize to justify a hard fork in the medium term 6-12 months.

Your missing the point, we have solutions in place now, that if adopted would reduce backlog and slash fees overnight. The market needs to figure out how to efficiently use blockspace or it won't ever matter what you try to do to scale. This means broad adoption of segwit wallets, batching transactions, and using compressed signatures. Rage at the exchanges for being careless and irresponsible with blockspace. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:23:12

Adoption 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:37:31
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:23:59
At some point the fees will peak and people will wait to transact(fees eclipse their desire to have a transaction posted). The backlog will clear and this will repeat again and again. Also, everyone should be slamming the exchanges that haven't adopted segwit that would supply considerable relief. But finally we should be looking at a comprehensive hard fork in 2018 to increase blocksize AND fix the backlog of items that need a HF to address.

Thats a loaded question, enough for what?

Logic says having open borders is a terrible idea in every possible way. Whether or not there are rapists and murderers (we know there are many of both) is largely irrelevant.

Segwit hasn't been adopted so there is an immediate fix in place that isn't being fully utilized. Its kind of inexcusable that virtually none of the major infrastructure companies like coinbase and bit pay haven't implemented it yet.

Your missing the point, we have solutions in place now, that if adopted would reduce backlog and slash fees overnight. The market needs to figure out how to efficiently use blockspace or it won't ever matter what you try to do to scale. This means broad adoption of segwit wallets, batching transactions, and using compressed signatures. **Rage at the exchanges for being careless and irresponsible with blockspace. **

No brainer implementing what's immediately available first (segwit wallet support by default), next a comprehensive protocol upgrade/fix hardfork that includes blocksize increase 2/4 mb seems safe and prudent. Then universal lightning support.

If your trying to establish some kind of appeal to authority by describing your finance and now geological prowess I'm not persuaded by such a low energy fallacy. You don't have the technical chops to attack bitcoin specifically, you wouldn't know what to do or where to begin in terms of improving the protocol let alone auditing it. You began your trolling streak by attacking people and here you have ended it by attacking me . All the while reinforcing the fact you have no technical skills in this area and as such you are not even equipped to substantiate any of your claims.

There is no correlation between TPS for bitcoin and power consumption. He most certainly didn't demonstrate that either.

@_date: 2017-12-19 20:41:36
well thats a lie, 2mb is pretty universally accepted as safe and wouldn't threaten decentralization. Segwit would actually increase the impact of the block size increase. Blocksize increase will become necessary just to handle opening/closing of LN channels if it is ever broadly adopted. There is no circumstance where the blocksize never increases and bitcoin can be used for transactions even as just the settlement for layer 2. If people can't reliably settle their layer 2 transactions on layer 1 then its over.

Spamming transactions is cheap because you only pay if the transaction is included in a block, most of the spam will get ignored and drop from the pool. They become even cheaper if you are mining them yourself (paying yourself with transactions fees)

Yes more people are using it but you can clearly already see that 10% segwit adoption and the fact that almost none of the exchanges batch transactions and there's still transactions with uncompressed signatures. how is that being a prudent use of a shared resource? Segwit adoption alone would reduce the number of backlog transactions completely meaning every transaction would be in the next block meaning every transaction would be an order of magnitude cheaper couple that with batching at the edges where we have exchanges and payment providers you're looking at an order of magnitude savings and block size that people are ignoring and not utilizing currently how can you deny this

2 thing missing that took me a while to understand is with a sufficient number of well connected nodes you can hit any coffee shop that exists.

Thus avoiding even more transactions on chain.

As I understand it, there is a backlog of updates/upgrades/fixes and improvements that should make it into a hardfork rather than simply blocksize increase. This was the primary reason i didn't prefer a hardfork to 2mb. It appeared to be a waste of effort in a hardfork.
I would fully back a well tested and robust fork to upgrade the protocol beyond just a blocksize increase.

IT doesn't. This a serious hype cycle which we don't know if it is starting, peaking, or about to end. All metrics I've seen point to still growing. Network effects are funny like that, they reach a critical mass and go viral, it is another way of saying exponential growth. Bitcoin continues to be experiencing this. What is unique about it though is there is no real response on the supply side to increasing demand. There are no pressure release valves, no means to increase or expand capacity to produce more bitcoins. Its an interesting economic dynamic which I think completely unique. Take Tulips for example, there was outrageous demand at some point and prices climbed way high, then the supply side responded by everyone wanting to grow and actually growing tullips. Tullips went from rare to plentiful in seemingly short time. This rebalancing of supply just doesn't appear in this market. 
Scarcity + no supply response + hype cycle = 20K? 30K? who knows.

You are correct, to get to the point that any channel can hit any other node on the network you need a large robust network. Oj order to sustain all your transactions on LN you need a network of easy on/off ramps like coinbase that will permit direct credit/debit of your open channel.

You can speed it up by using segwit. This will slash your fee in half to start. You can also use custom fees to low ball so you aren't overbidding fees. You can also tell coinbase and the like to start being more efficient also by batching and using segwit. Bitcoin software has provided tools for more prudent transaction management but the edges of the network are not using them

@_date: 2017-12-18 14:57:44
Well the point of the OP was that infrastructure providers are not adopting segwit or are slow to adopt segwit. What makes anyone think LN adoption won't take years as well? 
Its a valid point, there is no incentive for users to use it if the network isn't useful because its too small or lacks services and there is no incentive for service providers to adopt it if there are no users. Its a completely valid concern. Thats my point. 
This isn't about me or my timetable, odn't be an ass.. Blocks are full, fees are high and no solution is in sight for 2018. The minimal impact of segwit(even at 100% penetration) will be drowned out by the current frenzy of growth we're seeing by the end of  next year. LN just won't have any penetration right away. So here we are...no relief in sight.

Put simply, a short (or long) is only a good bet if the market is with you.

People that carry credit card balances pay for my vacations. I'm very clear how it works. I do know retailers bake in credit card fees into the prices they charge, there need to be near a flippening or near flippening from cc &gt; crypto for these savings to be reflected in the price, it would note be immediate, so maybe they can entice with a 5% crypto discount? I hope so.

I'm a cynic because I've been around since 2013 and I've seen how hype cycles work. I will admit though I've never seen anything like the growth frenzy we are in now all metrics point to exponential growth but I am worried that will be the blessing and curse for Bitcoin as many newcomers are turned off by the growing pains and the competition has never been more fierce as far investing in cryptos...lets face it, the herd mentality is fickle and can shift on you in a moment. I almost wish this cycle was pushed back six months. Oh well fingers crossed.

SLOW DOWN:
1) prior to the big block debate circa 2016, fees were dirt cheap, merchant adoption was still very low/slow
2) as a user, and a believer in bitcoin long term, I never see the 2-5% fees. However, I do get a paid vacation every year from credit card points and I get buyer protections. And I get 30 days to pay. So, I respect some small % of the population are out to take down banks and will hop on the opportunity. The average joe wants easy and cheap, plain and simple. Right now, buying bitcoin is easy, cheap...well you get 1.5% fee at coinbase. So to compete with venmo as a bare bones starting point you need a stupid simple app like venmo and no fees. **Are you implying that too will be ready this year?**

 Wallstreet isn't a single entity with a single trading strategy that it telegraphs ahead of time to reddit. It's an industry made of many private firms with secretive strategies for maximizing their profits. Game theory applies here, if reddit knows this master plan strategy, that means their hedge fund competition knows as well and they can crush their short position by taking a long or vice versa.
Tldr: Wallstreet isn't a single non competitive entity with a broadly communicated trading strategy. Don't be idiots.

having plans and solving the problem are two different things. One is completed and verified the other is just a plan. It would be impressive if 1 of 3 happen in 2 years and from what i understand time lines have already been slipping. This is fine and expected they are trying to upgrade an aircraft mid flight. Sharding and lighting requires separate nodes so they are second layer solutions. Bitcoin will also have second layer solutions eventually. I have nothing against ethereum its scaling problems are very similar to Bitcoin's. I just can't accept a suggestion they've solved it and bitcoin won't/can't

@_date: 2017-12-18 14:48:05
Being ready and being adopted are two completely different things. One of the 3 LN implementation may go live in 2018, but will it be adopted? I would suggest LN network growing to a sufficient size to be usable might take years, it just depends on who is promoting and marketing it. The problem is almost putting the cart before the horse, If I'm a user why am I using LN if the network isn't useful due to its small size/lack of services. If I'm a service provider why do I invest in LN if there aren't users? Segwit which was deployed in August/September is still mostly un-adopted. 
User acceptance is the major hurdle that isn't really being considered yet form what I've seen. There is certainly a market opportunity to create a Venmo like UX that rides on top of LN in the background.

Its not that serious, this backlog will incentive people to adopt segwit wallets, batch transactions and compressed signatures. Taken together these will wipe out the backlog and cut fees drastically. I think you should be aware also this is talked about non stop on this sub.

@_date: 2017-12-23 00:46:51
Rofl hyperbolic nonsense nobody needs to bend over backwards segwit and batching are solved problems just do it. Boggles my mind you somehow think upgrading an entire network all at once via hardfork is somehow an order of magnitude easier. Newsflash buddy it's harder. Again equivalent to making tests easier to accommodate the students that don't show up, do homework or study. Complete inversion of accountability. This thing NEVER scales globally with rampant inefficiencies at the lowest level. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:24:56
Taking a snapshot during an absolute frenzy of activity never before seen is dishonest 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:23:29
It's also being completely dishonest because if everyone decided today we needed 2 megabytes it's still going to take 6 months for everyone to upgrade. You mistakenly seem to think that a hard form doesn't require any work to imply when it probably requires more work because everybody has to be ready at the same time. Its not like using segwit and batching requires work and a hard fork doesn't. Where did you get this idea from?

Your missing the point, we have solutions in place now, that if adopted would reduce backlog and slash fees overnight. The market needs to figure out how to efficiently use blockspace or it won't ever matter what you try to do to scale. This means broad adoption of segwit wallets, batching transactions, and using compressed signatures. Rage at the exchanges for being careless and irresponsible with blockspace. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 13:10:05

Your becoming very aggressive and hyperbolic and it isn't helping you communicate your ideas. The reward for running an LN node is proportional to the usage of your node in the network. If there are 10,000 nodes like you but nobody using it, how big is your reward? This is still the cart before the horse as I've tried to explain twice now. Nodes are only rewarded if there are users using them to route transactions. Users won't use them if they have nobody to route transactions to.(because its not widely adopted and they have to keep opening and closing channels because there is no services yet to top off their LN wallet)
I've never said anything about segwit not having incentives. For a user provided your wallet supports it there is no barrier to entry at all.

Well we know that adopting segwit alone would return fees to normal. We also know people using LN would reduce fees further so your hypothetical is nonsensical from the beginning. At some point blocks would eventually need to grow but thwre is still quite a bit of runway.

Yeah i don't believe that at all. Nuclear power is abundant and cheap, solar power is abundant and their is still many other clean energy sources left to be tapped. Clean energy is an economy of scale issue and bitcoin will be the driver for the next 50 years of clean energy / renewable energy innovations as cheap energy is a competitive advantage for miners. The cheapest energy will win and fossil fuels will not be the cheapest energy available, its alread not in many developed nations.
I predict you will see mining companies partnering directly with solar and nuclear companies in the very near future to build out  additional capacity. Think about it, it costs less than $10 billion to build nuke plants. If a miner puts up half the capital now for securing free energy for 50 years they've just eliminated the greatest variable in theor profitability calculation and they added a revenue stream simultaneously. (selling excess capacity) 
@_date: 2018-08-27 20:10:59
Hows that?

I think ceo/banker salaries are kind of insane some times but it's not going to be the reason(excuse) I do or don't reach my own financial goals. If you pay off your debts and invest 10—15% of your salary there is really no mathematical way you can not be a multi millionaire by the time your in your 50's.

Not a Bitcoin problem as you stated. If you don't solve the economics of clean energy, it's all moot. Bitcoin will solve the economics as I stated due to scale, miners are first industry that has absolute mandate to find the cheapest energy possible. Harvesting coal, transporting coal, and burning coal is only preferred if the economics make sense. As soon as solar is universally viable coal is out the door for miners. End of story. Nuke plant permitting is different in every country.

I'm aware
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:05:04
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:21:56
Brief Timeline:
-April 2015
GS leads investment into Circle(which now owns poloniex)
-October 2017
GS CEO (not a profilific twitter user, uses one of his rare tweets to talk about bitcoin)
-December 21, 2018
GS reports launching BTC desk in 2018
-Feb 18, 2018 
GS warns investors about crytpo bubble
-May 2, 2018
GS BTC desk starting trading immiently as approved by board of directors (including CEO) Has already been clearing CME/CBOE futures for months. Will issue their own futures. Will trade directly once they have regulatory ok and institutional storage solution.
Interestingly, coinbase spun off a new company late last year.( dedicated to custody and institutional storage solutions. We could see a major headline their in the coming months. I'm sure CB is foaming at the mouth to get that contract. 
Goldman, has done a fine job down playing Bitcoin, still characterizing it as not a currency but just an asset that its investors want exposure to. Meanwhile, they have acknowledged at the highest levels of their firm that it is important enough to dedicate a desk to it. Surely, all of wallstreet takes notes when moves like this happen. I would be surprised/shocked if there isn't a flurry of activity at every other firm that isn't being reported.

Flunking out of school and shitting out half a dozen babies outside of marriage is going to result in a shitty life for you and your family. Interest rates only matter if you have habit of spending more than you earn. Predatory marketing is a cop out excuse.

1) No plans for naked shorting. 
2) in business agnostic is a term that we use in the business that simply means, we are unbiased towards the use of different technology tools to solve different problems. We believe there is no 'one size fits' all in the website development industry. so in this case, wallstreet is agnostic towards these investment vehicles because they make money when someone buys and when someone  sells they don't care if it goes up or down. Thanks.

You drank the kool-aid bro, i refuse to accept this poor me, entitlement society. Its quite simple dont spend money you don't have. Blame the banks all you want but the cancer is the victimization of everything. Fuck that, own your decisions own your finances. Stop the blame game. You made shitty choice(s) now  you get to reap what you sow. That being said bailing out the banks was a total moral hazard. That i can agree to.

So your argument is literally all energy consumption is bad and we should avoid using energy. Great solution. Totally viable.
Madlib for you 
&lt;insert anything here&gt; has no technical requirements to use coal.
So you can remove coal as an economically viable energy source or you can Removes energy consumption from all &lt;insert dirty energy consumers here&gt;
Gee i wonder which option is going to gain traction.... I don't see everyone abandoning electricity so maybe we should address the root cause instead of trying to guilt &lt;insert dirty energy consumers here&gt; into abandoning their energy usage. 
Oh but maybe if we just shame them some more they'll forget about economics incentives . Smh

Actually it says:
* ID verification – We don't require ID verification for all users, but in some situations you may be asked to verify your ID with us. We will ask you to ID verify in the following situations:
* After trading over certain volume limits and when advertising - It is our top-most priority to ensure that LocalBitcoins is a safe and securebitcoinmarketplace and that no one is able to use our service for money laundering or other unlawful activities. Most fraud on LocalBitcoins stems from users attempting money laundering. We believe that taking a strict stance in this regard is in the interest of our users and important for our brand as a trustworthy marketplace.
* Unauthorized access - If someone hacks your account we may require you to ID verify as part of the account recovery process.
* Fraud investigations - If your account is reported for fraud along comprehensive evidence we may ask you to complete ID verification as part of the investigation.
* Account recovery - If you've lost all access to your account we will ask you to complete ID verification as part of the account recovery process. If your account is NOT ID verified we cannot guarantee that we can return access if you've forgotten your password and you no longer have access to your email, even if your life savings are in your wallet.

So you keep ranting about coal and then saying its a bitcoin problem do you know how fucking retarded that sounds? As I've already explained there is no amount of kicking and screaming that will get you past the economic forces at play. Even if bitcoin did not exist, The only solution is economically incentivizing clean energy. If you cannot do that then nothing will change.
What you still don't get is "chinas energy plans " or whoevers plans are irrelevant. The economic forces of the market determine the demand for clean energy not the government of China or any other government. 
In conclusion, if the problem still exists in the absence of Bitcoin then it isn't a Bitcoin problem.

your arguments are so dodgy and weak, you must be a bitch. 
1)Information symmetry  doesn't exist anywhere in any market stop pretending regulations will magically fix that. They haven't in hundreds of years. 
2) Regulatory Arbitrage exists. Traders that want unregulated or lessor regulated markets will move elsewhere(they already have, US markets do not lead bitcoin for exactly this reason), this means regulators just succeeded in blocking all that economic capture.  (See new york bit license)
3) You've made no argument on why individuals should not have freedom of choice. Your argument goes something like this: "if you don't like it leave" .....thats not an argument.
4) why would an anti-economic freedom bitch like you be so involved in bitcoin anyway?

Because bitcoin miners don't have a requirement to use coal energy or fossil fuels. Its quite simple. 


lots of industries use lots of power, this isn't an argument.


we already established that.


Again miners have no requirements to be in China. Bitcoin miners leaving china won't magically shut off coal power plants either. This comments makes no sense.


As I already mentioned, Securing the cheapest energy is my core objective as a miner after I've acquired my hardware. 
Renewables and nuclear will be cheaper because of all the reasons I stated previously. Which means miners will be incentivized to move to renewables and nuclear because there is really no way to churn out more efficiency in the coal burning business.
Ask yourself this question, why doesn't everyone have solar panel roofs? The answer is the economics of it don't make sense yet. As soon as cost benefit equation of solar panel roofs flips(turning an expense into a profit center), everyone will demand solar roofs on their homes and not a moment sooner. This applies to miners as well. As soon as Chinese solar panel efficiency/cost ratio beats coal energy china will lead the world in solar (driven by the demand from miners).
So the solution to any perceived problem of energy usage and emissions is self evident. Do not try to fight the economics here by demanding lower energy use and pointing your fingers at bitcoin(a futile effort) , divert all available resources towards nuclear and renewable build out to try and flip the cost benefit equation as soon as possible.

If you did that and maxed out your 401k and put the $200 payments you were making into IRA mutual fund instead you will be a millionaire within 20 years.

Depends on what your goals are for bitcoin. Small niche technology or mass adoption? I think everyone in bitcoin hopes one day for it to be at a minimum competitive with credit cards as an accepted and used payment method. How do you disrupt banking (globally) with such small tps? Even if you targeted just the unbanked....that is hundreds of millions of users. If you build for niche, niche it will remain.

The feds could shutdown the exchange for any number of reasons,  the company could shutdown their servers for "maintenance", they could halt trading in the name of a 'glitch'  etc etc etc.

The evidence is called math. Start with your target transaction capacity, visa transactions per second is popular.  Then determine  what size blocks would be required to handle that. Then multiply that by how times per day you add a new block. That is just a small piece of the bandwidth because nodes broadcast transactions and help other nodes synch the blockchain which is now growing rapidly because it's visa sized.  Get it?

exactly. No economic incentive = no full node. If you want to see full nodes increase, switch to asic resistant PoW so that full nodes can mine with consumer grade HW = Economic Incentive run full nodes.

Until there is a BIP to economically incentivize non-mining nodes this is entirely irrelevant. 
I like this guys ideas and thought patterns, lukejrs also, but the problem isn't disincentives. The problem is there was never an economic incentive. You cannot create an economic incentive by elimination of non-economic disincentives.
Also there is no wide adoption without a multitude of light client implementations so discouraging them is also shooting yourself in the foot.

@_date: 2019-03-11 18:36:32


Then you are focusing on the wrong problem as I've been stating. Why do you want to engineer for a diminishing marginal return on node adoption by experimenting with augmenting non-trivial features of bitcoin? Seems completely nonsensical to me because as you stated you KNOW an economic incentive would work and by all prior evidence messing around with disincentives doesn't move the needle at all in proportion to the risk.


I agree. Its probably not even feasible this far into the experiment. I also know you won't move the needle by targeting disincentives either. Lets face the facts here, running a full node is NOT hard to do. The barrier to entry is very low, they run on minimal hardware. You can even run it in the cloud for probably &lt; $20 a month. If we are saying the economic benefits can't be changed. And the non-economic benefits are set in stone also...then lets stop pissing in the wind and work towards building something that at least increases adoption even if its not the full node adoption we would prefer.

Yes and if there is no net incentive then its an easy decision. Lowering block size doesn't create net incentives.

Stay focused, we are talking about 380k transactions remember? You tried to make a point by equating transactions with the price of a single bitcoin, remember?Transactions move much more than a single bitcoin which I've proven easily. You made wildly inaccurate estimates because you are to stupid to know how to use a block explorer for the real numbers.
A specific example.
50 blocks from blockheight 565100 to 565150 contained 97734 transactions. Total coins moved 2,353,846 for a total value @ $3900 of $9,180,002,375....learn to math fuck wit

Well if you want to encourage adoption then you need to support light clients and the variable ways that people might want to implement them because as has been thoroughly beaten like a dead horse we have no way to incentivize full notes so at the very least we should be incentivizing any kind of adoption even if it's lightweight clients

If that is what you rely on its a lost cause. I'd consider myself an order of magnitude more educated than the best you could hope for a mainstream person to be. I am not convinced full node is that important to me right now.( I do run one) A full node only becomes important/critical if you need to max out the validation, security and privacy properties of a full node. If you don't need that...it doesn't matter. You can never convince me why I need that unless I were say living under a regime like Venezuela or China.

Well then your argument is doubly doomed. If after years of active interest I am still uneducated on the matter you have no hope of educating the masses. Again who will fund such an education effort? No one. Why? Tragedy of the commons. There is no economic incentive to do so. 


SPV clients are described in the white paper and BIP 37. I understand that I am not trusting anyone because I can randomly cross validate the info from multiple nodes. I understand there is a [potential privacy trade off]( in using bip 37 which is why bip 157 is important.

vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify
transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated
transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to
protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid
block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to
confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to
run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.
It would have to be majority of nodes not just a few hundred miners. This wouldn't be trivial to pull off undetected.

No your not over estimating. In fact, you don't need to estimate at all. Every transaction is on the blockchain. You can literally write 3 lines of python and calculate the exact amount transacted. Who is the retard now?

Yes just what I want to do, administer and correlate traffic and events on a network where each host has two addresses with absolutely no measurable benefit. why DO SOMETHING ONCE WHEN YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING TWICE! Surely no way for that to go wrong. Why would I enable unnecessary services on machines that as you stated a single gateway can manage perfectly fine. Unless you are bored there is no benefit to adding that kind of technical debt.  Remember technology is supposed to make things easier and if it isn't accomplishing that get rid of it.

Ive addressed all this elsewhere in the thread. If we are done trying for asic resistance then I'm not sure how else you economically incentivize nodes without a network subsidy. Then best case is cost neutral node. If we can get resource requirements to run a node in the cloud at $1 per month I think that's probably the best chance of getting close to cost neutral. Currently it would costs probably $15-20

I don't follow. Neutrino is an improvement on SPV why shouldn't it be in core? Neutrino needs to be run on a full node to be useful to mobile devices just as nodes need to server SPV clients for spv to be useful. 


Neutrino is not more trusting than SPV tho. THere is no evidence that Neutrino reduces node count.

So this space is tough because there are plenty of people that can ramble on about things they only half understand. This means its very easy for someone to sound very knowledgeable while simultaneously being technically full of shit. The worst are those that are technically strong enough to disingenuous misrepresent arguments in a way that sounds totally legitimate to the untrained eye (i.e. Peter Rizun). This makes it nearly impossible for less technically inclined folks to sort out the truth from the shit.

Mixed mode just means i use LN for somethings but not all(i.e. I can't operate currently operate my financial life purely in LN) . You cannot top up a channel, at all, its close channel and open new channel so at least 2 transactions on chain. Mixed mode is a problem because you habe lots if people opening and closing channels frequently. That part doesn't scale far.    I understand the network effects improve the efficiency of LN. This means that on chain transactions will peak during the transition period (mixed mode) and decline as adoption reaches market saturation. My concern is that people down voted me into oblivion when I suggested it would take bigger blocks, faster blocks and every other throughput increasing measure available to get us through that peak period.

You can't convince them. The only path is on boarding users without them knowing it. If the value proposition of your tech requires teaching users about decentralization you've failed before you started.

The metric their ratings improved 40% is in relation to their previous ratings not in relationship to their actual peers. Hence, you are able to say their ratings aren't in the shitter because they did better against their previous ratings.  Its the type of manipulation if facts that would get you fired in most places. "We aren't actually doing terrible because we did better than before." better than before in this case isn't mutually exclusive to still doing terrible.

Look im sorry you're struggling with the English language but by the very fact i can think up many and multiple scenarios where those things have no value negates any notion of intrinsic or inherent value. Something inherent or intrinsic doesn't change in accordance to conditions or circumstances, it is by definition a static characteristic. Value is subjective(always), intrinsic characteristics cannot be applied to subjective and variable characteristics as that would be contradictory. Fish swimming in water is an intrinsic trait. Humans breathing oxygen is an intrinsic trait. The value of oxygen is not intrinsic it is variable based in the circumstance.

The problem is this is literally not a possible scenario(7 billion people) without a transition period where people are in a mixed mode. That period in mixed mode will easily overwhelm the network and stunt adoption. The condition of supporting 7 billion peoples transactions asserts that all of them must join at the same time thereby eliminating the necessity to close channels once they are open. Which is why I say a moderate to large implementation, say 10 - 100 million users that use it some of the time would be enough to completely swamp the network in the constant opening and closing of channels.

What you are discribing is fdic insurance. I would suspect an insurable crypto product to surface at some point in the relatively near future based on multisig implementation. Overall im in agreement with you, security is appallingly difficult even for professionals and the client software is no where near where it needs to be.

Yes, at this point ive paid for multiple National and international flights with points from credit card spending. Is that illegal in europa? Also cash flow management means that, expenses in a given month come in haphazardly, and salary frequently is bi-weekly. if my  80% of my expenses happen in the first 10 days of the month this could Eclipse my ability to cover them in the first biweekly salary payments. By putting everything on a credit card i can pay one bill on the same date each month never worrying about the ebbs and flows of income to expense. Meanwhile i earn points that pay for my vacations or earn 2-3% cash back. (typical offers for credit cards if you have good credit)

See this is getting so nuanced that it's probably on the cusp of semantics and hypothetical. Meaning we are at an impasse and are obviously missing the core point of it all. You see black and white and I see gray all over. This is probably a deeply ingrained perceptional difference that will never resolve itself on reddit. That being said I'm less concerned with the labeling and more sincerely concerned with the us vs. Them. Neither side or the violent (terrorists) within them represents anything I have in common with the Americans ive ever met or been around. Let's just agree its a good thing their numbers are small.

Dude your literally claiming a vast conspiracy with the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation(with no proof) against mountains of evidence of the &gt;10k organizations and non-profits(they literally can't give away their money fast enough) whose work they continue to fund and who's missions continue to better the wolrd. Are you suggesting every organization they fund is in on this vast conspiracy, just the ones that are most impact? I'm not even sure how you can badger me about evidence while suggesting a vast conspiracy that is competely unfounded. 
I don't even know who Edward Bernaise is , though I do like Bernaise sauce on my steak which I can enjoy whenever I like with the money I've earned from exchanging my skills/services in the marketplace. 
That being said regardless of what economic/political ideology you subscribe to, there are facts that remain there are a finite pool of money and resources(material and human) and SO FAR the best method of determining how they are deployed most efficiently is through markets not through centralized authority. Government has never done anything more efficiently than a private sector company other than waging war but thats only because they have an inherent monopoly on human resources. That being said I don't think their is any options on the table (at least from what you've said) that REALISTICALLY propose a better system.

Derivatives are different than commodity trading aren't they. You can buy contracts for cotton lets say for a delivery date of September. In order to buy that contract someone needs to be selling cotton(actual cotton) to be delivered in September. If you do not liquidate that contract you are the proud owner of potentially alot of cotton  cime September. Isn't this why oil tankers sit full off the coast? Contract holders get stuck with the product and can't take delivery

There are legitimate unanswered questions about it. Some of my concerns are 1) stupid easy guis are some ways off, if my non tech relatives cant yse it without realizing they are using it, it wont be adopted 2) there is no way to top up an open channel so unless you receive wages in LN or don't mind tying up a lot of capital everyone will need to open and close channels frequently. This doesn't scale far. 3) the incentives seem unbalanced, incentives to accept LN payments and use LN payments is directly related to the network effects of the LN implementation, given the problem of  there seems to be strong disincentives to not invest in an unproven and uncertain network. 
Unless of course you are talking about 10+ years from now then that uncertainty may have been reduced with other protocol improvements

I understand stand low costs once you have a channel open but open a channel requires tying up some amount of capital and for many folks (everybody) who won't be getting wages via LN theb that means opening and closing many channels multiplied by all the parties participating.

Unlawful acts of violence and intimidation at a political rally is a broad stroke that certainly covers both groups.

I think you are very confused about what your threat model is or what it should be because your threat model should be first based on reality and you should be focused on mitigating the threat vectors that are the most likely to occur not trying to mitigate every Threat Vector. Even companies, huge companies with huge budgets have hundreds of FULL TIME SECURITY staff they are not able to mitigate every Threat Vector what makes you think that you can or that you even should try?    
So let's pull the thread on your situation of having a package intercepted. first you would need to take the probability of all the packages in the world and yours being randomly selected that is a ridiculous probability. In the event that you think you are targeted then you've already failed your operational security because they know who you are and they are targeting you and in that case you should not be shipping packages to your targeted identity, so that's a second failure. 
Do you see why this paranoia makes no sense?

Pure oxygen being shot at your face at 1000000 Psi isn't inherently valuable is it? You're stranded in South pacific ocean, surrounded by water, under blistering sun. Sharks circling, lots of intrinsic value in the water around you?   Also, artificially restraining supply of a resource can't create intrinsic value, it can create profits tho.

Are you talking about a single event and forgetting every other time antifa was the instigator and aggressor? If so it's simply a stroke of luck someone wasn't killed previously. I think both sides are violent extremists and repugnant but not terrorists. If you want to call both terrorists thats on you I'm just not sure where the line is that you are attempting to draw. Were the blm militants that murdered half a dozen cops terrorists or extremists? I'd argue the later as well. Just curious where the boundaries start and end.

That is a different matter entirely. Hedging your bets and taking profits are separate matter from forecasting.

Not at all. Maybe in a criminal or civil trial in which they have signed a representation agreement and have a win/loss record to maintain.

Less proof than an audit maybe, but an audit doesn't look at everything either. They sample and test from that sample. Auditing isn't "forensic accounting" , I'm  not sure why everyone thinks that is what auditing is. 
@_date: 2019-08-20 18:35:01
Well I mean you can make up whatever facts you want. Mandatory spending accounting for 66% of the budget has nothing to do with tax cuts and certainly didn't materialize over night. You could confiscate all the wealth from the rich and fund the government for 6 months so then what after that?
As far as preserving our food supply while not ideal the alternatives are letting our enemy China continue to fuck us OR let our food supply wither and die. Neither options are optimal but fighting our enemy and preserving the food supply is prudent given the alternatives. The tarrif from China pay for the preservation of the farming industry.

They aren't a public company though and they owe nobody anything. 
Secondly, the maddof example is pretty horrible. In that case, he controlled the assets in their entirety with zero transparency on what the assets were actually invested in if anything at all. With tether, they are issued to exchanges, in exchange for fiat. Once they are issued outside of tetherco they cannot be taken back without refunding the fiat. They are now publicly tracked on the blockchain and also subject to market forces on each of the exchanges. Madoffs Ponzi worked because nobody knew what was happening behind the curtains. At a minimum half a dozen exchanges know what is happening behind the curtains in this case.

Eh? 
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:29:32
no you are misinterpreting, they independently verified(The bank verified it directly) 1 day which is more than any audit usually does. They received the financials over an undisclosed period of time which they also validated against the tether transparency page. Most audits I'm aware of do not solicit input from Bank institutions at all. There were two verifications here, one by the Law firm convering an extended period of time using the evidence provided by Tether. Second, by the Bank covering one day point in time that utilized Evidence provided by the banking institution. Is it possible that Tether forged evidence from the previous time period prior to the banks verification, it sure is possible. However, given the circumstances we could never achieve higher degeree of certainty in this area as Banks are not generally part of scope of any audits I'm aware of.

I'm pretty sure we'd all sleep fine if they were short a few percent. Most people are convinced there is no money at all. Nobody wants a fractional reserve. I'm giving it &gt; 80% liklihood that the money observed in those accounts is proof of tether reserves. THat leaves a 20% chance they are bamboozling everyone somehow, though I can't even figure out how they could fool the exchanges using tether because they can easily audit the actual flows of crypto and fiat and a fractional reserve would be easy to detect in this case as it would create unbalanced books somewhere in the chain.

Well I think you're mischaracterizing decades of out of control spending but the point wasn't blame gain. Just to point out the obviously ludacris assertion the executive branch under Trump is somehow responsible.
I agree with cutting taxes and reducing spending.
If the principles of a country changed with the wind America would be over before it started. Thankfully their are still enough constitutional conservatives to keep us "relatively" anchored. I have no idea what you are talking about with 8 kids? I can't imagine being so reckless and irresponsible to bring life into this world with the expectation that someone else should foot the bill.

I believe in evidence. 
They just did an ex-FBI (director of examinations) led examination with independent bank verification of proof of reserves for all issued tether. 
The scope of the conspiracy theory doesn't meet the occam's razor test. It doesn't past muster when you consider Bitcoin cannot be inflated and how easily a fractional reserve would get exposed from pure economic principles.


No its not weird at all when you understand how hostile Banks and Governments are towards crypto businesses and especially foreign crypto businesses that are pegging digital assets to the USD.

Are you talking about the peg in/out process only? Peg-out is through a participating exchange currently until the lightning swap tools are fleshed out. Once you have pegged in L-btc itself is non custodial. You can create as many wallet addresses as you want and use confidential transactions to send them wherever. At which point they would have to shutdown the network to censor your specific transactions.

Congress appropriates spending not the executive branch. Also, to educate the brainlets the mandatory(social security, Medicare, medicaid and interest in outstanding debt ) spending increases were on an extreme upward trajectory well before Trump. Mandatory spending is 66% of the budget. All Democrat candidates want to vastly(in the trillions) increase mandatory spending.

No miners mine in order to sell for a profit. they don't mine to hodl.

I do understand we are a net exporter of food. I also understood that promoting a food production surplus is in the best interest of national security. It would be quite risky to produce exactly what we needed and no more. We can endure a supply shock due to disease or weather and still not be dependent on external supply. This is a strategy worth maintaining, it's called putting prudence in front of politics. 
I love this terrible take, "there are plenty of ways to get China to the table besides tarrif". Yes so many ways that no single administration in my lifetime has bothered to take up the task. What are all these amazing ideas for China that are being sequestered away for the "perfect time"?
It's not an all or nothing judgements it's that in every point made you have sided with China.
- Tarrif or no tarrif you prefer buying Chinese. 
- whether or not you agree to challenging China you prefer to back down if it inconveniences you at all 
- you prefer to sit on all the good ideas for dealing with China in favor of letting them go unchallenged for another 10 or 20 years? 
 do you even have a red line in the sand for China? 
Is there any China policy matter that you don't side with China on?

For the same reason you would trust an Audit. Its an independent verification of evidence that provides assurance for the scope of the examination. What you are looking for and is not possible is some transparent perpetual proof of funds. This doesn't exist. Any examination(audit) or otherwise is only a point in time.


yet you have no quantative evidence to support this conspiracy theory.


Nobody besides internet fools buys this baseless conspiracy because they understand economics, arbitrage and supply and demand would have caught all the tether using exchanges naked already.

Yes bitcoin will, somewhat ironically, power the renewable energy adoption worldwide within 5-10 years.

Its not complicated, provide any quantitative evidence to support your conspiracy theory.
There is no way to audit this without a continuous audit of all Banks they do business with past, present or future. This isn't possible. no company does this. Why would they? Why would they need to? Right now your conspiracy theory is throgoughly debunked. Their own bank attested to the information provided. (this never happens in an audit) and the ex fbi investigators attested to a longer review of their finances. 
Your argument is empty, literally no evidence to the contrary.

how would you audit this without relying on the same Tether provided evidences that were used during this examination? Keeping in mind, the bank today, Is not the bank from a year ago. Banks generally have no legal requirement to respond to audit inquiries from third parties in regards to specific customer accounts. Meaning, their legal departments would never allow it for if nothing else liability reasons.
Second, a ponzi would have revealed itself already as the economics and arbitration would have eaten away at the fractional reserve (especially during the downturn). Further, it would have been hard to dupe one exchange into this con, but duping several? Occams razor...no.

Well you're now moving into game theory. And the game theory of successfully performing and extended 51% attack is higher barrier than previously thought. Attacking and attacking with a certainty of profitability is quite different. Frankly this is why bcash still exists at all, it's easy to attack it but profiting directly from the attack is much stickier as you risk a chain split and good economic actors (exchanges) may reject your fork. Frankly i believe the economic driver for keeping bitcoin successful is higher than aby temporary effort to extract short term profit by 51%. The attack itself lowers the value of the value of assets stolen. Its counterintuitive and counterproductive

Well you're kind of close but your numbers are all off because your assumptions are all off. First of all miners Break Even isn't homogeneous it's different for every minor many miners are currently operating at a loss because they have a long time preference for Bitcoin and a operational burn rate with months and years long runway.(ie they're mining today not planning to sell until 5 years from now anyways.) 
Secondly the difficulty adjustment has nothing to do with being a one-to-one ratio with the amount of miners that have left the network. As soon as the difficulty adjustment does happen unprofitable miners become profitable again.(vice versa) So more more miners join the network. It sounds like you have subscribed to the downward spiral Theory which has been debunked proved false many times over and you could just look at history to determine that. Also you can look at the current mining hashrate increase that has been on the climb despite negative price action. The system is designed to find equilibrium.

true but if you've used LND you would know that the concept of auto pilot already exists. Meaning the software does what it should and manages the opening and closing of channels for you. Yes it obviously needs more intelligence which will come in time but its not hard to concieve of a user spending from a bitcoin wallet and never knowing (or caring) which channel was used to pay or the mechanics of how the tx was assembled. Good software will abstract that all away.

You have a rather one dimensional view of bitcoin. Miners do not determine what bitcoin is. They are one of 3 parties on the network that decide what bitcoin is. 
Secondly you haven't established how you can guarantee profit while attacking bitcoin. You must consider an immediate 50% drop in value of the asset you are stealling(more broadly a massive dive across the market), next you must consider &gt; 50% chance you are completely unable to fence your stolen asset. Lastly you have to consider there is an unprecedented incentive to thwart your efforts as you just tried to fuck every stakeholder(in crypto really) and that will make you enemy number 1. This means every miner, exchange, VC, HODLER, hacker and cypherpunk in the entire space will come out of the woodwork to ensure your efforts are a total fail. I could imagine as scenario where you would spend more on DDOS protection in the first hour of your attack than you could ever potentially make. If you think you are going to double spend exchange tx and then turn around and cash that in at an exchange you are quite twisted on how deep the resilience is on this network. 
So best case scenario you attack the chain devaluing it by 50%, fork it, have your fork rejected by exchanges devaluing your fork further and on top of that your DDOS'd into oblivion.

Timely 


Encouraged by light-touch regulation, private companies invested over $1.5 trillion in nearly two decades to build out American communications networks. Without having to ask anyone’s permission, innovators everywhere used the internet’s open platform to start companies that have transformed how billions of people live and work.
But that changed in 2014. Just days after a poor midterm election result, President Obama publicly pressured the Federal Communications Commission to reject the longstanding consensus on a market-based approach to the internet. He instead urged the agency to impose upon internet service providers a creaky regulatory framework called “Title II,” which was designed in the 1930s to tame the Ma Bell telephone monopoly. A few months later, the FCC followed President Obama’s instructions on a party-line vote. I voted “no,” but the agency’s majority chose micromanagement over markets.
This burdensome regulation has failed consumers and businesses alike. **In the two years after the FCC’s decision, broadband network investment dropped more than 5.6%—the first time a decline has happened outside of a recession.** If the current rules are left in place, millions of Americans who are on the wrong side of the digital divide would have to wait years to get more broadband.
The effect has been particularly serious for smaller internet service providers. They don’t have the time, money or lawyers to cut through a thicket of complex rules.** The Wireless Internet Service Providers Association, which represents small fixed wireless companies that generally operate in rural America, found that more than 80% of its members “incurred additional expense in complying with the Title II rules, had delayed or reduced network expansion**, had delayed or reduced services and had allocated budget to comply with the rules.” They aren’t alone. Other small companies have told the FCC that these regulations have forced them to cancel, delay or curtail upgrades to their fiber networks.
The uncertainty surrounding the FCC’s onerous rules has also slowed the introduction of new services. One major company reported that it put on hold a project to build out its out-of-home Wi-Fi network partly because it wasn’t sure if the FCC would approve of its business model. **Nineteen municipal internet service providers—that is, city-owned nonprofits—told the this past May that they “often delay or hold off from rolling out a new feature or service because we cannot afford to deal with a potential complaint and enforcement action.”**
This is why I’m proposing today that my colleagues at the Federal Communications Commission repeal President Obama’s heavy-handed internet regulations.** Instead the FCC simply would require internet service providers to be transparent so that consumers can buy the plan that’s best for them.** And entrepreneurs and other small businesses would have the technical information they need to innovate. **The Federal trade Commission would police ISPs, protect consumers and promote competition, just as it did before 2015.** Instead of being flyspecked by lawyers and bureaucrats, the internet would once again thrive under engineers and entrepreneurs.
The FCC will vote on this proposal on Dec. 14. If it passes, Washington will return to the bipartisan approach that made the internet what it is today. Consumers will benefit from greater investment in digital infrastructure, which will create jobs, increase competition, and lead to better, faster, and cheaper internet access—especially in rural America.
In the next few weeks, anti-market ideologues are going to try to scare the American people. They’ll argue that government control is the only way to assure a free and open internet. They’ll assert that repealing utility-style regulation will destroy the internet as we know it and harm innovation. They’ll allege that free speech online is at risk. Don’t fall for the fearmongering.
We have proof that markets work: For almost two decades, the U.S. had a free and open internet without these heavy-handed rules. There was no market failure before 2015. Americans weren’t living in a digital dystopia before the FCC seized power. To the contrary, millions enjoyed an online economy that was the envy of the world. They experienced the most powerful platform ever seen for permission-less innovation and expression. Next month, I hope the FCC will choose to return to the common-sense policies that helped the online world transform the physical one.

Yeah thankfully thats not how they've regulated cryptocurrency at least outside of New York. Missteps are part of any industry, the response though is what needs to be calculated and precise in order to not stifle growth. That is the center of the argument here, not whether there should be no regulation but whether the regulation is enabling more or less competition, because that historically determines the benefits for the consumer. you didn't help your argument with the murder comparison.

ok ignoring correlation is a fine position but it's not superior to what the bad guy says, remember the ISPs are the bad guys you said.
Being capped and getting capped are different. I don't care if I'm capped as long as it doesn't impact me. If 99% of customers never reach caps why should I care that 1% have to pay more. At some point you're not under residential agreement and should switch to business internet connections. Or just pay as you go after caps like wireless.
Those caps/ throttles aren't noticeable the average users...why can't you pay for more if you want more as long as they are transparent?

. UN sanctions and a guerrilla uprising finally led to free elections in 1979 and independence (as Zimbabwe) in 1980. Robert MUGABE, the nation's first prime minister, has been the country's only ruler (as president since 1987) and has dominated the country's political system since independence. His chaotic land redistribution campaign, which began in 1997 and intensified after 2000, caused an exodus of white farmers, crippled the economy, and ushered in widespread shortages of basic commodities. Ignoring international condemnation, MUGABE rigged the 2002 presidential election to ensure his reelection.

Timely 


Encouraged by light-touch regulation, private companies invested over $1.5 trillion in nearly two decades to build out American communications networks. Without having to ask anyone’s permission, innovators everywhere used the internet’s open platform to start companies that have transformed how billions of people live and work.
But that changed in 2014. Just days after a poor midterm election result, President Obama publicly pressured the Federal Communications Commission to reject the longstanding consensus on a market-based approach to the internet. He instead urged the agency to impose upon internet service providers a creaky regulatory framework called “Title II,” which was designed in the 1930s to tame the Ma Bell telephone monopoly. A few months later, the FCC followed President Obama’s instructions on a party-line vote. I voted “no,” but the agency’s majority chose micromanagement over markets.
This burdensome regulation has failed consumers and businesses alike. **In the two years after the FCC’s decision, broadband network investment dropped more than 5.6%—the first time a decline has happened outside of a recession.** If the current rules are left in place, millions of Americans who are on the wrong side of the digital divide would have to wait years to get more broadband.
The effect has been particularly serious for smaller internet service providers. They don’t have the time, money or lawyers to cut through a thicket of complex rules.** The Wireless Internet Service Providers Association, which represents small fixed wireless companies that generally operate in rural America, found that more than 80% of its members “incurred additional expense in complying with the Title II rules, had delayed or reduced network expansion**, had delayed or reduced services and had allocated budget to comply with the rules.” They aren’t alone. Other small companies have told the FCC that these regulations have forced them to cancel, delay or curtail upgrades to their fiber networks.
The uncertainty surrounding the FCC’s onerous rules has also slowed the introduction of new services. One major company reported that it put on hold a project to build out its out-of-home Wi-Fi network partly because it wasn’t sure if the FCC would approve of its business model. **Nineteen municipal internet service providers—that is, city-owned nonprofits—told the this past May that they “often delay or hold off from rolling out a new feature or service because we cannot afford to deal with a potential complaint and enforcement action.”**
This is why I’m proposing today that my colleagues at the Federal Communications Commission repeal President Obama’s heavy-handed internet regulations.** Instead the FCC simply would require internet service providers to be transparent so that consumers can buy the plan that’s best for them.** And entrepreneurs and other small businesses would have the technical information they need to innovate. **The Federal trade Commission would police ISPs, protect consumers and promote competition, just as it did before 2015.** Instead of being flyspecked by lawyers and bureaucrats, the internet would once again thrive under engineers and entrepreneurs.
The FCC will vote on this proposal on Dec. 14. If it passes, Washington will return to the bipartisan approach that made the internet what it is today. Consumers will benefit from greater investment in digital infrastructure, which will create jobs, increase competition, and lead to better, faster, and cheaper internet access—especially in rural America.
In the next few weeks, anti-market ideologues are going to try to scare the American people. They’ll argue that government control is the only way to assure a free and open internet. They’ll assert that repealing utility-style regulation will destroy the internet as we know it and harm innovation. They’ll allege that free speech online is at risk. Don’t fall for the fearmongering.
We have proof that markets work: For almost two decades, the U.S. had a free and open internet without these heavy-handed rules. There was no market failure before 2015. Americans weren’t living in a digital dystopia before the FCC seized power. To the contrary, millions enjoyed an online economy that was the envy of the world. They experienced the most powerful platform ever seen for permission-less innovation and expression. Next month, I hope the FCC will choose to return to the common-sense policies that helped the online world transform the physical one.

Regulations don't stop it out right they choke it, think of it like trying to start a fire in a hurricane with matches and wet leaves. You can do it if you follow the regulations, the regulatory burden is real. The incumbents have entire departments dedicated to compliance. Have you ever worked for a Bank or a government contractor? If so you would see burdensome regulations in action.

Top Kek on this is" Obama economy" guess that's why markets sky rocketed day of Trump election and haven't stopped making new highs. Nothing will kill this economy faster than a Democrat winning election deal with it.

Well that is more nuanced than you are insinuating. There are owners of the infrastructure, owners of the broadcast spectrum rights and then the leasee's that lease in bulk and resell services from the owners. There is quite a lot of business models and competitors within that framework.

I'm well aware what an SAR is and the requirement for an SAR is the same at 10k as it is for 250k. So yeah any limits over 10k are arbitrary from a legal point of view.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:46:46
Yes it wasn't necessary. None of the feared problems were actually a problem requiring specific regulations. We have consumer protection laws already and we have anti trust laws already. Enforce and/or shore up existing laws.

But the main problem, which was addressed by 1 of 3 of obama's orders in 2010(2 were vacated) was transparency. If I buy a data plan and they disclose they throttle my access and how they throttle it so I can make an informed consumer decision why is that a problem? This notion they will overnight start block and throttling willy nilly is completely unfounded. If I were a competitor and my peer decided to throttle and block things, guess what I would do? I'd offer unlimitted no throttle plans for $5 dollars less than my competitor and steal all their clients. I just don't understand the business case behind the hypothetical arguments, they aren't sustainable business models and would be rejected by the market in the first place. The money they would lose in the PR night mare alone would defeat any and all potential gains from doing it. This completely ignores the costs to support the call centers as they see a 10,000% increase in volume. Doesn't include the costs to recapture lost customers.(customer acquisition costs) All of this is in a formula, they know a head of time what the market will bare, and the fact is without OVERT market collusion (which is already highly illegal) this would be a massive losing proposition.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:11:17
no there is no AML rules in play this is purely coinbase created friction, sure they could be justifying it with security/fraud but really it should be straight forward to verify identity and allow full withdrawal of funds.
Why should someone with $250k have to deal with 5 SAR's filed on them in order to withdraw that money? The case for fraud is limited here:
1) verified user identity
2) matching bank account identity
3) 2-factor authentication

You are directly challenging the articles data bout infrastructure investment since 2015, are you saying the data is bad, or the correlation should be ignored? I just want to be clear what your position is because you didn't provide contrarian data just subjective response from ISPs.
Someone posted a summary of NN cases here in the USA and Canada, there were fewer than 10 of them in 20 years, and the majority if not all were intervened upon by the FCC and and the bad actors were dealt with. Seems awfully small and doesn't strike me as a dumpster fire or imminent disaster. **Would it be fair to say well their have been 10 major hacks of Bitcoin exchanges since 2009 so all transfers have to go through a government body now? **
I'm not ignorant, I have to be subjective and somewhat anecdotal here but I've used comcast, att, and Spectrum and have never been throttled or capped from what I can tell. I would consider my activity heavy and above average regarding bandwidth.
Wireless companies moved people off of unlimited plans in general yes, but you can still get unlimited plans from sprint/cricket? because its sufficiently easy for a company to come in and lease tower/satellite rights and re-sell their own plans to their own customers. Keeping the regulatory burdens lower allows this type of activity/competition.

You are continuing to say NN will be shut down, this is false. The vote will revert the title II treatment of ISPs, meaning the regulatory state will return to the same one that existed from 1996-2015. I don't remember the sky was falling two years ago.
As far as peering agreements and "slowing of internet" , thats best left to the contracts between peers. What matters to me as a consumer is that the 100 mbps that is promised to me by ISP is delivered. If not they will be open for mass class action suit for a violation of a host of laws.

Were there bad actors from 1996-2015 ABSOLUTELY! Was it widespread? Was the industry as a whole sick and dying.......NOOOOOO
Please, lets consider the data before spreading this fear mongering. The market simply wouldn't support long term any of the shitty provisions you and others mentioned, data caps, extreme throttling, etc..
ISPs would be shooting themselves in the foot, competitors would come in lease a bunch of bandwidth and resell it undercutting them. This happens today in Cell phones, how many comapnies out their lease Tower bandwidth and are purely marketing and sales companies with no actual infrastruture or satellites?

Heavy Handed Regulation kills innovation. Look at bitcoin industry in New York(bit license -  . Secondly, reverting the title II decision isn't removing all regulation, FCC will still have oversight and power to sue bad actors in the space as it did from 1996-2015.
Further, your premise that net-neutrality is a necessity wasn't even established as factually valid. What is true  and factual is that the internet was just fine from 1996-2015. What is true and factual is that infrastructure investments by ISPs (especially smaller ISPs) is down since 2015.

No this is over simplified answer. For starters you can rebalance with loop in/out. Multi-party channels spread on chain tx across many, dozens, hundreds or even thousands of users.. And finally swapping between blockchains dynamically and trustless will permit you to choose which chain you want to pay a fee in based on security or costs.

The easiest way imo to reject larger blocks is to acknowledge the following:
1) urgently and Permanently settling your transaction on the world's most secure immutable public ledger comes with a cost. Anything other than that is the "I want a free pony why won't you give me my free pony" argument 
2) an extension of 1, if you don't require urgent and permanent settlement of your transaction on the world's most secure immutable public ledger then bitcoin (L1) isn't well suited for your use case.
3) scaling is very easy if you are ok with indexed sql databases serving your network in high throughput data centers, ask paypal. 
 
4) increasing block size is at best very temporary and very linear solution

Seems obvious to me that the shared resource is the bitcoin ledger. If we made blocks larger to make fees lower/effectively free some new network participant would selfishly seize the opportunity to fill the blocks with their use case and so you end up with full blocks again. As long as transactions fees are so low as to be effectively free the resource will be used until capacity is reached and degradation occurs in the form of higher fees.

Seems obvious to me that the shared resource is the bitcoin ledger. If we made blocks larger to make fees lower/effectively free some new network participant would selfishly seize the opportunity to fill the blocks with their use case and so you end up with full blocks again. As long as transactions fees are so low as to be effectively free the resource will be used until capacity is reached and degradation occurs in the form of higher fees.

That somehow the architects of our republic have gotten it all wrong when it came to preserving individual liberty is as un-american as it gets.

I'm not sure you understand what I said. Lets take twitter as an example. 
I choose two data points, a smiley and a sad emoji to represent a 1 or 0
I create twitter bot script that takes input (any file/image) and reads it as a binary data stream, it then tweets out consecutive tweets filled with a smiley or sad emoji that corresponds to the 1 or 0 in that bit stream. 
Now twitter is hosting binary encoded data of my choice.

It is nuanced I know so bare with me, but changing your mind for a belief is different than having a casual opinion. Its like a Jew becoming a catholic. This isn't a simple decision to not put sour cream on your taco. Beliefs are deeply rooted and rarely change, opinions are flimsy and malleable. What we are watching is a shift in beliefs not opinions. The account is willing to completely change infrastructure of the bitcoin.org this isn't casual opinion changing. 
You could be right this person could just have shitty opinions that change with the wind

I'm not encouraging it and I don't think it is encouraged in our military. Its a cost of war, in general, all wars have civilian casualties.

They also arm and weoponize woman and children, they target woman and children victims as well. Its safe to say where the moral compass is pointing when looking at us vs. them.

I think its pretty clear to me in the general terms in which the law was written
• Check casher
•*** Currency dealing or exchange***
• Issuer of travelers’ checks, money orders or stored value
• Seller or redeemer of travelers’ checks, money orders or stored value
IMO it would be hard to argue its neither a store of value or a currency when the very act of selling it makes its storage of value self evident. It's broader use as a currency and storage of value don't help either.

high end engineers cost monies. Then you have infrastructure costs, and office space. $2.5 million for anything bleeding edge technology wise is quite trivial. Whats the more important number was what valuation they raised that money at. was it 2.5% stake at $100 million valuation? I don't know but it could give visibility into how much those investors think the tech and company roadmap is worth.

It would require a very naive interpretation of the law to persue this as a crime.

Ask your local shop to accept it then. Any "new coins" will still face the same issue. Having "better tech" isn't enough for adoption. You need order of magnitude (100x) improvement of the user benefits.
 A new coin cannot supplant with better tech the defacto benefit of bitcoin which is its rewarding of individuals that have a long [time preference]( Better tech is not enough to replicate the decentralized network properties, the network effects and anonymous creator of Bitcoin.

1) I'm not sure how else it would work. 
Alice has a channel with Bob. Charlie has a channel with Bob
Alice -&gt;Bob&lt;- Charlie
Charlie can send to Alice and vice versa through bob. 
Now if Alice wants to send to Dan, there is no route because she is insufficiently connected. 
Why is that Whack? This is like basic Peer to Peer stuff. Even in Bitcoin core, the node is seeded to the network with 8 connections by default. Why wouldn't LN do something similar?
2) Well i'm not sure what you mean but substantive. The premise is shaky in the first place. Why would I be running a node and not be managing my channel liquidity.It would take nothing to make this a standard feature in wallet software.

This would seem to be a naive interpretation in what a file is. As we know a transaction cannot store images it can store arbitrary data which need to be be reassembled by a perpetrator to form the desired file. You can use any medium for storing arbitrary data for later reassembly. The key is knowing where to find the data, and how to reassemble it. You can for example encode an image by transmitting emoji only messages on Facebook and then providing a decoding script. 
This is made easy by the binary nature of data. All i need is two distinguishable data points(a smiley emoji and sad emoji for example) and i can transmit and hide in plain site anything that you can think of.

without context its just random data. You need the context of the decoding algorithm and the location of the specific bytes of data for reassembly. Until you have that context its random bits. Having that Algorithm establishes intent, using the algorithm establishes possession. Any other interpretation is a hilarious fundamentally flawed understanding of computers.

Dollar amount | Addresses with

Getting 1,000,000 to buy $3k would be nearly doubling the current wallets with $1k. Not happening.

Yes they are actively improving this in the next BOLT spec update. This method was left basic because truthfully discovering routes can be done in many ways there is no single requirement every client must use the same rout discovery method. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:16:35
I'm happy you put a bit more effort into this, I knew you had it in you.
Well I'm not an expert or even novice but I'll attempt to take a crack at it.
1) I'm assuming you mean one of the tx that arrives first depletes the required liquidity for the second route to succeed. The current train of thought is to encourage "failing fast" so that the secondary and tertiary routes can be tried in quick succession. In most cases this shouldn't be more than a matter of seconds. 
2) 


This isn't an actual requirement that must be known ahead of time. 
Routing today is gossip protocol where everyone stores locally a copy of the network graph and updates it as required. This of course isn't practical at scale. What seems to be a misconception or fud being spread that Routing must be done the same way across all nodes. This isn't true. Routing resiliency WILL probably depend on some primary assumptions that nodes are connected to multiple other well connected nodes which maintain larger routing tables and can respond to queries from smaller nodes. 
As far as liquidity concerns go, this will become less of a concern as standard configurations come into play. Assuming things like multiple channels, liquidity would be handled by the software on the node. The software would be monitoring liquidity on open channels and rebalance its own channels as necessary. Secondly, AMP ( should allow for more flexibility in taking a larger payment and breaking it down into smaller chunks as to reduce the route liquidity requirements to be more consistent with the mean for that route.

Her wallet knows this and will re-balance her channels for her. This is trivial and any usable wallet implementation will have this going on without any input.
The user will say I want to pay bob, but the software will say before I can pay bob I need apply rebalance channels or pay through a known route to bob form one of my other funded channels.

He was being extorted by a federal agent. To be fair, even if the emails were forensically proven to be 100% authenticated, I don't think the government has successfully brought murder 4 hire charges against someone they themselves were extorting. It would pretty much be the most shady, scandalous and outrageous example of entrapment.. ever.. The logic here is straightforward, if the federal agent hadn't been trying to extort him, he wouldn't have tried to have him or anyone killed.
That being said, plenty of reasons he should  be behind bars without needing to distort things with these allegations that were never brought to trial.

2) A hardware wallet that is always online is just a gimicky and expensive hot wallet. We have great wallet apps already with great reputations and years of use that don't fool people into believing they are being "more secure"
3) Recent hardware wallets were attacked and compromised with physical attacks. This just got a fuckton easier because unlike my trezor or ledger I carry around my phone everywhere everyday and  phones are already a target for theft.

Common misconception. Bitcoin can continue growing purely on SoV use case. Hype begets adoption begets price increase begets hype. SoV use case gives rewards to those with a long [time preference]( As long as that maxim continues to hold true there is no further need for "extra projects" . Extra projects and use cases are bonuses.

They can tell you only what you permitted them too.

Furthermore double taxation of after tax income is immoral and we apologize for attempting to classify bitcoin as anything other than a currency. Lastly we demand the IRS stand down on its unwarranted and unprecedented fishing expeditions on exchanges that serve crypto currency users.

The term “money services business” (MSB) includes any person doing business, whether or not on a
regular basis or as an organized business concern, in one or more of the following capacities:
• Check casher
•*** Currency dealing or exchange***
• Issuer of travelers’ checks, money orders or stored value
• Seller or redeemer of travelers’ checks, money orders or stored value
• Money transmitter
• U.S. Postal Service


in one or more transactions (in one category of activity listed above) on any one day. A business is an
MSB for each activity for which it meets this threshold. However, there is one exception. No activity
threshold applies to the definition of money transmitter. A person that engages as a business in the
transfer of funds is a money transmitter and an MSB, regardless of the amount of transfer activity.

He defrauded the Australian government and his every move since then is an attempt to rewrite history and fabricate a paper trail that he was in fact doing good for the world and not in fact defrauding Australian government. An elaborate con to avoid jail, he's targeted the Satoshi myths because he thinks that the authorities are idiots confused by big crypto technical buzz words buried in his lawyers legal documents.
He went after Gavin and Andreas as an attempt to establish a panel of expert witnesses that could attest to the narrative he was actually being busy doing good deeds for the world. 
The most remarkable part of this scheme, is there is a substantial portion of the Bcash community that look up to him as a technical and strategic leader, which improves his case against the Australian Government.

No. See the fail fast reference earlier, I sort the returned routes by some arbitrary criteria and try each one in sequence. 


*this returns if there is a route, not what the liquidity is


*will fail with a temporary channel failure message immediately, if there is a liquidity problem on the route
This will signal the wallet to try the next route. This would happen also if a node in the queryroute response was for some reason unresponsive or choosing not to forward your request. Individual Node Channel Liquidity should be getting re-balanced automatically all the time for each node so failures ought to be VERY temporary. And with AMP there would also be a rebalancing of the tx itself to "right size" the amt to reduce likelihood of depleting nodes. Keep in mind this logic will be transparent to the user, the software would just do this as a best practice.

That's exactly how that fallacy works, but instead of debating semantics of your fallacy what say you to the direct statement from dalio mouth ten days ago that he doesn't know much about bitcoin/crypto currency as a technology or an investment. How does that fit into your own subject line?    
Edit: he isn't wrong about difficult to spend bitcoin. It is difficult and it's difficult to buy too. He isn't wrong about volatility either. BTW... Also revealed in the interview was that he has reached his conclusions because he owns bitcoins not because he has a vendetta.

project planning is a profession, you know that right? Its dedicated to making road maps and executing stated project goals. Planning is a central part to success-at-anything. Personal success, professional success, business success, it can be applied to anything. It is a principal not coupled to a business. Core does have a planning process for release *in general* so its not like bitcoin is developed with zero planning. Being decentralized project doesn't de-value planning.

Yep and the response was appropriate. It doesn't sound like Bitcoin to you because you haven't full comprehended what Bitcoin is in the first place. And thus I would suggest its not a big leap to assert you definitely don't know the first thing about side chains or the LN. In conclusion, the reason why it doesn't "sound like bitcoin" to you can be explained by inferring at best you are willfully ignorant and at worst you are an idiot. So which is it?

- don't need to find "optimal" paths, routing can be implemented many ways No need to agree to a single method. The LN is just a topology.  Routing is a matter of targeted discovery. 
- hypothetical, aand irrelevant since you can cash out (swap) to any participating blockchain.

"Refuse fascism" is still a violent radical left group. Kinda moot who funds it.  
Seems straight forward. 
You're the type that won't accept resources of any kind so i am not bothering to google: soros money trail refuse fascism  
Had you done that you'd see its well documented   and broadly reoorted . Then you'd say oh those sources are biased or reject it on some other pretense because it creates cognitive dissonance for you and doesn't jive with your confirmation bias. See its no point in discussing it further when you're mind is closed to facts.  Can you just admit to yourself and me you wouldn't accept any evidence?

Difficulty doesn't come into play. Decryption of 1024 bit key encrypted file is easy also if you have the key. But in any case pulling messages out of the blockchain isn't that task. The task is knowing which messages to pull and reassemble in what order. 
return_op is 80bytes 
Lets take a small shitty resolution screenshot, 64 Kb, 65,536 bytes
Now lets see how many transactions I would need uncompressed.
820 (rounded) 
Stumbling blindly and being able to accidentally assemble 820 tx op_return payloads....seeems.....unlikely. What is more likely is you have some CONTEXT, (list of txids) and a small program to do that for you.

No it doesn't, I already have a right to transact in whatever currency i want free of interference and double taxation. And that right is inherent in the constitution. Congress doesn't have authority to grant that right. If you give them the authority to grant freedoms it's an equal authority to restrict them which this bill overtly does, it sets limits in my freedom. The bill should be one sentence, crypto currency is currency and the IRS must terminate unwarranted fishing expeditions into its use as such. . End of story.

Well amex is a company stock. We have NOT passed them in payment processing. And since bitcoin isnt a stock the comparison is arbitrary.  A apples to apples comparison would be bitcoin payment processing vs. Amex. Valuation comparisons again, are arbitrary because a company stock isn't a comparable asset class to bitcoin.

That seems to be a whole lot of context. 1) a file system 2) containing files 3) files of a common image file format 4) file matching known file hashes of contraband. You would need to perform a whole lot of processes on the blockchain to even arrive at an assembled file. There exists algorithms to assemble contraband from the text of public literature also. But again without the context of that algorithm and/or the resulting output of that data the literature is just literature.

Literal nazis are the in their 90s and mostly dead. White supremacists make up less than one percent of one percent of the population.

I can't follow 19 different threads you have going now the goal post moving is out of hand here. This was always about taxation and why its wrong. My argument was simple, the system was designed with a reasonable threshhold of work force participation with a temporary safety for those in between jobs or those that fell on a rough patch in life. In its current state, the contributions are mostly on the backs of middle class while large swaths of people don't contribute at all and have no incentive to ever leave what should be the "temporary" safety net of social programs. This is a failed design. This is me working to pay for others that don't work...ever. That is immoral. Now all those other tangents you went on may very well be true and valid but they aren't on topic. Edit: my source is my goddamn w-2

First of all your percentages are a bit deceiving. It should be the ratio of people with assets when they die. to begin with we know 50% of Americans dont pay an income tax and surely have no assets so including them to dilute the percentage impact is dishonest. Secondly we also know the super wealthy are not impacted because they keep their assets overseas controlled by a network of trusts.
Thirdly, $5 million in assets in Not alot! Financial advisors are saying i need 3 million at retirement to be comfortable! Throw in a house thats appreciated and whatever small nest egg you are easily hitting that number.

The internet routing isn't optimal either. Its effective, risilient and reliable which trumps optimal. But they also claim "routing" like its a single solution.

Its an interesting topic but I cannot think forking code is enough to create a tax event or tax burden as you have no say in such things. The taxable event is likely represented by claiming the forked coins, i.e. Trading /selling them. I would think it could then be treated as zero cost basis capital gain.

There are a lot of caveats to those two paragraphs, the biggest of which is that quantum computers capable of doing anything like this don't currently exist, and no one knows when -- or even if ­- we'll be able to build one. We also don't know what sorts of practical difficulties will arise when we try to implement Grover's or Shor's algorithms for anything but toy key sizes. (Error correction on a quantum computer could easily be an unsurmountable problem.) On the other hand, we don't know what other techniques will be discovered once people start working with actual quantum computers. My bet is that we will overcome the engineering challenges, and that there will be many advances and new techniques­but they're going to take time to discover and invent. Just as it took decades for us to get supercomputers in our pockets, it will take decades to work through all the engineering problems necessary to build large-enough quantum computers

Vcs invest in 100 projects to get 100—1000x on one. Not a great example. The tokens can potentially be used in the platform if the vaporware materializes. It doesn't mean the tokens will ever return value in terms of utility on said platform.  Most say explicitly they won't.

If you can't prove argument with math at this point then you might need to recheck your assumptions. If the conclusion is you would need to process more transactions than their are stars in the sky then its not likely to happen. But if Break even is actually 100K tx a week @ $.001 then this can be incentivized through fees.

I prefer alice , bob and charlie but your example is correct but overly simplistic. You are rather useless on the graph outside of the specific case you demonstrated. The graph will need liquidity providing nodes to connect your local graph view with the greater network. A liquidity providing node is one that exists almost exclusively to connect the graph and provide liquidity. Your example is typical of the "last mile" of the route but the cases i"m talking about are for more complex payment routes 5, 10+ hops removed from your immediate local graph view.

No the $100 came out of the original loan amount of $1000. I can only invest $900 on day 0 but I still owe $1000 (5 x $200 year)
Unless you want to do it the other way for simplicity 
$100 fees gone on day 0
$1000 x 5 years @ 7% = 1,402.55
no $100 fee, so I can make extra yearly payments of $20
$220 year x 5 years @ 7% = 1,353.72
again when faced with the risk of the investment going south and defaulting on the IRS loan, just not worth it.

Modeling it visually doesn't change anything. Using the correspondent bank network model(bank is a loaded word I know but for the visual): 
Envision each correspondent bank as a well connected liquidity providing node instead, At different liquidity levels. So lets say 3 tier system.
Tier 1 - small class(consumer setup), liquidity .1-1 btc, channels 50-500
Tier 2 - medium class (professional setup), liquidity 1 - 100 btc, channels 500 - 5000
Tier 3 - Large Class (Enterprise setup), liquidity 100-10000 btc, channels, 5000+
Assume Consumers will typically connect directly to 2 or more Tier 1 or tier 2 nodes. Also again assume, liquidity providing nodes will have capabilities to maintain local and remote balances sufficiently since balances are monitored locally and can be rebalanced, closed or reopened in near real time(re-opening of course will require on chain tx waiting period). Assume tier 1-3 nodes are well connected not only to consumer wallets but also other liquidity providers so there are several layers of redundancy for routing and re-balancing.  
Incentivizing this model at this point is based on the singular assumption that a tier 1 - 3 node can at the very least cover operational costs of providing the liquidity. That is the bare minimum, most will be seeking profit but I would assume some percentage will be doing it because they can without a profit motive. But for the majority we have prove say 95% of tier 1-3 nodes can break even or better using relay fees only.

What point are you making because I don't think you actually know. We are back to what I originally said market share with no context, means nothing. I'll use baby numbers
Lets say the retail industry is 100 (generic units for simplification)
Amazon has 95% of that so 95 units
Case 1) market stays at 100 units but amazon captures 40% or 40 units.....this is a huge loss. of more than 50% decrease!
Case 2) market increases to 500 Units but amazon captures 40% or 200 units. This is a huge gain of 105 unites more than 100% increase!
Clearly you can see that the 40% share means nothing outside of the context of the total industry.

200 year x 5 years @ 7% compounded annually = 1230
 the diffence is $300
 the diffence is $1500 but you have disclose all your assets to the IRS and they can make you liquidate them to avoid any of this kind of funny business

THis is a very easy case to present if the channels are such:
Alice -&gt; Bob &lt;- Charlie 
And alice wants to send to Charlie. That can be accomplished in two ways: 1) Charlie needs to set --push_amt flag to some value greater than the ammount alice wants to send him or 2) Charlie needs to have already made an ammount of payments to/through Bob greater than the ammount Alice  wants to send. 
This is a very simplistic case in which routing will likely never be a big issue but in a larger network you have to solve the liquidity probablem for N hops between sender and recipient. There needs to be directional liquidity all the way through. This liquidity needs to scale such that any sender can send to any recipient. Given some basic assumptions that they(sender and reciever) are both adequately plugged into liquidity providing nodes that are "super connected" to other liquidity providing nodes. Something along the lines of six degrees of separation. So really the question isn't about incentivizing bob to route alices payment to charlie but more how do you ensure there are enough super connected liquidity providing nodes that any sender can send to any recipient with extremely high chance of success?

nodes can provide liquidity in one direction or both for each of their channels. However a payment route path needs sufficient liquidity at each hop on the path. Simply plugging in more nodes or channels may have zero impact on the liquidity path if the same choke points exist.

Thats not quite accurate imo, the barrier to entry isn't setting up the node but its reliably providing liquidity. Anyone can set up a node, how many can be well connected AND provide sufficient liquidity that makes them a desirable hop in a route.
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:58:50


Thats the question. Supposedly for profit. You said thats not possible. I said prove it, even loosely with napkin math.


I think that extreme scenario fails immediately. Just pay them on chain and be done with it. LN is scalable micro transactions first. So I think you need to be thinking sub $500


It doesn't take a few dollars to open a channel btw. But for $1000 dollars your path forward would likely be something like atomic multipath payments where you don't have on channel paying $1000 you have many smaller payments.


You only need inward capacity and as a routing liquidity providing node you fund your inward capacity at channel opening using the --push_amt flag


KYC comes out of left field. no smh. just no. Your channels know about each other so you can rebalance at any time removing the need to know ahead of time what is coming.

Well I'm not sure they are being honest with each other. The research proposal to develop the 1gb testnet was/is planned to happen over 3-4 years with no indication of working viable product being ready by the end of that. Lets assume a best case scenario and the research is fruitful...they can convince their network to swiftly upgrade to 1gb in 5 years. My guess is, they'll fix malleability before that and be using LN in some capacity with in 2 years. The LN is to valuable to not participate in

The visa model doesn't make sense here though does it?
Simple situation
Alice -&gt; Bob &lt;- charlie
There are 1 of 2  scenarios that need to happen for Alice to be able to send to charlie.
1) Charlie funds the remote end of the channel(Bob) on channel opening because he is expecting to receive funds at any time
2) Charlie has previously sent Bob funds on an already open channel greater than the amount expected to receive from alice. 
Nodes that are providing liquidity as part of their business model would then as default take the value of the channel and split the balance between the local and the remote node. The node software would understand the remote and local balances of all its channels and could easily self balance so that the local and remote balances of each channel are always maintained above a threshold. This seems trivial. 
But the question is what is the break even point for running a well connected liquidity providing node like this? How many transactions must it process at what fee point.

Not exactly, an exchange will know a payment is from Alice because it will be in response to an invoice coinbase sent them. A payment relay will have to be treated as an unknown source abd destination there is no audit trail to say otherwise.

That doesn't provide liquidity to anyone else but the person opening the channel to the merchant. In a routed lightning network model which is the one everyone refers to when they discuss scaling. Routing has 2 components, do the nodes know about each other, do the nodes have sufficiently liquid channels between them to route payments back and forth. Of course anyone can open a channel directly with a merchant they want to pay. THis is a stupid use case for LN though.

Thats not how it works though  when you finding a valid path, it isn't cumulative. The value being sent has to have appropriate liquidity at every hop. There for simply adding a channel doesn't impact the net liquidity of a given pathway.

the fee is the sunk cost of the loan. if I don't take an irs loan i don't have a sunk cost of the loan fee. The $220 is going into the investment fund annually not to the loan. Why was that so confusing. 
The calcs your making are completely simplistic and not accounting for the risk of carrying debt. The scenario of making $50 more taking the loan and investing it is in perfect market conditions where you average 7% in the 5 years investment vehicle. This is the perfect case for a measely $50 gain. It only makes sense at all because the irs interest rate is ridiculously low as you stated this scheme falls apart at any retail interest rate or everyone would be doing it and banks would be giving you more than .01% in your savings account. 
If your pitch is you can make a couple of hundred extra(at best in perfect market conditions) ok yeah fine sounds like a gamble but yes its possible. Nobody is getting rich off that bc anyone with a fucking brain isn't going to take that risk. There is too many variables that are out of your control. Lose your job, fucked. Miss a payment fucked. Market downturn fucked. All for what a max upside of $50 dollars per thousand.

taking a rather comfortable tone towards someone you know nothing about. I don't know anyone that has accumulated any kind of wealth or success that it "came easy" for...they all worked hard for it. So maybe we are saying the same thing here. But I stick by my original statement, if it were easy to consistently beat markets in bitcoin or whatever, everyone would do it. I've been around this sub long enough to see many get rich quickers lose their shirts gambling in the markets. The ones that are successful are few and far between but they are hyper focused on nothing else.

Digital forensics. Unless this guy is a counter forensics expert I'm sure his conspiracy is already well documented in the nooks and crannies of his OS. Theft of this size would meet the mark for fbi involvement.

No that doesn't change any of the other mountains of evidence discovered from the dudes laptop, and corroborated by witnesses. He was caught logged into the SR admin. If true, the fact there was another hacker on the silkroad server, at best proves there were multiple criminals perpetrating crimes involving the server. There is no such defense as oh this guy ovwr here was committing crimes too so im not guilty. They are completely mutually exclusive.

Yeah in the documentary the only credible witness in the entire thing was probably the scientist and everyone else was absolutely morally bankrupt and I wouldn't trust to give a truthful statement at all they were literally career criminals and people that would lie cheat steal assault or kill or rape for money. 
I think his connections to that criminal underworld on the on the island initially gave him a feeling of power but it probably backfired for him as the ex gang members he hired and his Entourage were probably feeling empowered themselves and probably got into things outside of what they were hired to do that brought heat on him. 
These were characters that would probably take it upon themselves to take out a perceived enemy of his just to find themselves in higher esteem or as a broader  plan to blackmail or extort him. It would be hard to argue that there weren't several or dozens of people that were targeting him for kidnapping extortion etc etc to the point where the national government itself probably was in on it too. 
They probably heard through the grapevine that this guy is a gringo with a lot of money who is getting too big for his britchrd. Also in the documentary you can see they actually raided this compound found nothing, found the leftover remnants of the lab he had with that researcher and that was it. 
That was probably a blatant Shakedown by the government's most powerful enforcement agency so needless to say half truth, no truth, may be entirely lies, there's probably way more to the story that will never be known but I would say the shadiest thing and the most believable thing was the researchers testimony.

1) what jurisdiction will they sue?
2) How will they compel payment of the suit if they win?

So it's OK to hold community hostage for 2mb but not ok for users to force segwit?
The consensus agreement is doa. Its a punt. It has no teeth and no guarantees of anything coming to fruition after another year and a half of community destroying debate.  Why don't miners leave? They clearly dont have any respect for users or devs

Here's the thing tho, we know LN participation requires at least two on chain transactions per channel a user opens. Even with a moderately successful implementation the network will be overwhelmed very quickly. Baring that in mind why would a company invest in LN deployment knowing their success relies on onchain transaction throughput improvements that may or may not be coming soon.

I just listed just some of the marginal costs that don't disappear with disinter mediation. I'm just not sure how you can delude yourself into thinking every system needs a blockchain solution or that it would every be profitable or a major competitor. The product has to be order of magnitude improvement to unseat an incumbent. 
In this case it introduces complexity and a host of other issues(privacy) with the hope that there will be only a marginal improvement in pricing(which I actually don't think exists). At best you appeal to niche group of blockchain geeks.

Define production ready, define everybody. Define real time. Look I'm not yanking your chain but you are asking vague questions for a project that has no leader or authority. But, I would suggest, there is a good 2 years of maturity that needs to happen in the client and node software to get to a level of transparency that users can use it without knowing they are using it, without knowing about channels or any of the other technical underpinnings. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 21:07:26
But I think thats what worries people, is the lack of adoption a symptom of the low scalibility or vice versa. I think it's a valid question to ask what incentives does a company have to invest on building on bitcoin without any promise of scalability to meet their user demands.

This reads to many people like a lot of uncertainty. Uncertainty if LN will catch on at all in any significant way, uncertainty that if it does the network will be able to scale fast enough. Uncertainty that any front end will be so goddamn easy nobody will even know their in LN. I said any LN with modest success meaning a few million users. This is a modest goal but nothing in the grand scheme of things. The LN model is rendered useless with any high fees(i.e. Im not going to PAY $1.00 to open and close channel just to buy $3.00 coffee, it makes no sense at all.) so as soon as it becomes moderately successful and the blocks fill its own success will lock in its failure.

I agree too we will need both on chain and off chain scaling, but I think the crux of the issue is how do you account for the missed opportunity costs of not scaling in anticipation of need. What i mean is, i hope most of us agree bitcoin can be used for much more than it is today but many of those use cases require scale, why would any company invest in those cases without the certainty of scale. By all measures it seems they haven't and they won't. Even the investment required to build out a practical LN network and recruit users and vendors would require some guarantee the recruited users can all transact and even a mildly successful LN implementation would max out blocks quickly even with sw.

So like I said they do not have ability to make 1nm chips. Make a transistor in a lab ok that's an achievement but they haven't even figured out mass production of 7nm or 5nm, so proof of concept is just that.

Believe me there is no reason as a consumer why I would put my money in a holding pattern by opening a channel if there was not a sufficient enough use case for spending it. Building out this network of vendors and consumers may never happen. Without that network there is no use for LN. Either way that build out hasn't started, could take years or never happen.

This is a misconception... LN transactions require at least two on chain transactions for each participant, a modestly successful LN network would very quickly max out blocks again. The problem being why would anyone invest in recruiting participants for a LN network with the uncertainty of blocksize still lingering.

LN requires on chain transactions for all participants at least two (one to open one two close) to be effectiveLN also needs many participants, it's unclear how these participants(vendors and consumers) will be acquired and which LN  models will be deployed. Relying only in LN which as it stands will launch with a network too small to be of any practical use seems... Shortsighted.  It might take years for a  LN to take off as far as adoption, it might never take off. There must be alternative contingencies

Scam is a word that gets thrown around too loosely. Im Sure most ico have good intentions to deliver on their product promises. However, like all startups, most will fail because the product doesn't have a market or was too ambitious, poorly managed or some other reason. This doesn't make it a scam. Most, if not all ico right now are vaporware or mostly useless MVP. THE ICO craze will come crashing down to reality.

I don't follow your version of English very well, this is true.

There are 17 core team members listed ( however we know there are actually many many more contributors. So, finally for the math(technicals), 5/17 = 29% . At BEST, blockstream wields &lt; 1/3 majority, certainly not enough for consensus control of core. So there you go, your conspiracy is shattered.

You don't understand pleas. Often you plea to less charges and less severe charges. In exchange you get lower sentences not because the judge feels like it but because the FEDERAL SENTENCING GUIDELINES set forth the min and max and guess what less charges and less severe charges come with less time. Balking at this deal you run the risk of getting found guilty by your peers on the more severe charges that carry more severe sentences.

Thats a narrow view in my opinion. The users do know because in order to participate in an eth dapp I need eth first. In a Roostock/bitcoin one I need bitcoin first. Hence, if you want to tap both markets it would make sense to publish on both platforms. For example prism.exchange will be publishing on rootstock/bitcoin and eth to capture this increased exposure of appealing to users of both currencies.

Your right we don't have proof they didn't discover this hack 2 years ago and sell it to the highest bidder prior to release now. We can't prove that. We can prove they did sit on the attack for an undisclosed period of time, so they could irresponsibly and unethically disclose it without any compelling case for the "greater good" just to make a name for themselves.

while true you still can run your own node. The federated model makes sense because the L-btc is already pegged to pow chain btc. It would be kind of pointless to have L-BTC POW chain pegged to btc pow chain. You can still control your keys which is important and with confidential transactions the federated members really have no knowledge of who you are to censor your tx specifically. The trade offs seem worth it imo.

ok ......what assertion do I make here? I said "what proof do you have?" thats a question not an assertion. You know the difference right? How mad are you? You are completely unhinged if you think "what proof do you have?" is an assertion or a claim. Its literally me asking someone to support THEIR claim.

Doesn't have to do with mimikatz. Eternal blue was patched in January, this is a variant of that so you aren't vulnerable if you patched. Or you can shutdown smbv1 and enable smb signing in like &lt;5 lines of powershell. Both are free and easy methods

Bitcoin transactions are just a series of bits when decoded by the software equal some instruction to the bitcoin network (ie send bitcoin to this address). An instruction (series of bits) can be encoded in a seemingly infinite number of ways. Such as embedded into a photo or a series of emojis in a chat. So long as the recipient understands the encoding methodology they can appropriately redirect that series of bits representing instructions for the bitcoin network.
Conclusion: unless you can stop the transmission data on all possible communications medium(i.e. A mailed letter, wifi, radio, text message, satellites etc etc) then you cannot stop bitcoin transactions.

While im not particularly worried about this attack I think its safe to say avoiding responsible disclosure here was irresponsible/reckless as there is no compelling case for providing a public benefit with immediate release in this instance. (it was not released immediately anyway they sat on it until conference time) These guys did it for notoriety nothing else, quite embarrassing for them and the industry.

Getting 2fa codes is quite easy you just refer them to a fake web page they enter the 2fa code and then you forward it to the real page. it's easy and if you need to you call them up and you say you're from binance and say hey what's your 2fa code you need to sync up your security, its called social engineering.

What criticism did you make? You made up a [red herring]( which was me "allegedly" making assertions I never made. When tasked with quoting me, you equitted me of the accusation as nothing you quoted was any kind of claim at all. You then [moved goal posts]( by insinuating an assertion that I never made. As stated previously the only position I have taken in the entire exchange was the continual  reiteration that those touting a vast tether conspiracy have never substantiated their claim which it is their duty to do so under the burden of proof fallacy.

No, it's already outside of theory, segwit is live in litecoin you can see for yourself. Segwit reorganizes transaction data, so you can pack more transactions into each block. So any further block size increases are more impactful in terms of transactions per block. Im not against on chain scaling, we'll need both to scale globally.

The two segwit and blocksize aren't related tho. If we already have segwit that increases the impact of any block size increase so why not? Seems like doing both would buy alot of time. Where as doing only one seems to delay 6-18 months the beginning of a new destructive debate.

Seems to be working fine. If you need urgent settlement and permanent recording of your tx in the most secure decentralized public ledger then you must pay. If your tx doesn't have those requirements then don't pay top fee(delay settlement), don't use layer 1 (use layer 2) or don't use bitcoin (use a crypto with the properties you need) at all if it doesn't make sense for you. 
Bitcoin isn't a free pony, we don't need bigger blocks or to change bitcoin because you want a free pony.

There isn't a governing body, correct. In general, to be ethical, you must weigh the benefits of immediate disclosure against the consequences. But also take into account vendor response. If they are dismissive, unresponsive etc... You have a clear path for disclosure. Ethical standards are established around what is for the greater good. Yes there are grey areas but this case isn't one.

Im not sure I follow. Segwit is proven to fix asicboost, fix transaction malleabilty and increase capacity and makes all blocksize increases thay come afterwards more impactful as the reduced size of transactions is carried forward forever. Change once reap benefits forever. It also enables lightening which is a no brainer and trust less rootstock(almost) also a no brainer. Block size increase alone does one thing only solves full blocks for a year maybe, two tops. Doesn't bring any other innovation to the table. Fixes no bugs adds no efficiency and enables zero new features. Whatever you suggested is not even proven, has no bip, no peer reviewed paper, it's vaporware with no implementation in sight.        
@_date: 2017-06-28 12:42:44
Its pretty obvious LN is but one way to get more transaction throughput. It's not the end all solution. We will need continued research in to both on chain and secondary layer solutions.

We can agree to disagree but if your threat model doesn't include third party risk then you don't need to take nation state attacks into account when you are securing your own bitcoin. That is to say the difficulty and complexity in taking ownership of your own wallet and coins scales with the value of your holdings and subsequently the expanse of your threat model. 
That is to say if you only have $100(Easiest) well yeah third party risk isn't a big deal  your only out $100 bucks. 
 dollars maybe a paper wallet (very easy) or a mobile app with paper backup will suffice. 
 your probably looking at hardware wallets (easy-moderate) with recovery seeds in a safe or two
 +  your probably looking at glacier protocol(very difficult and complex), hardware wallets and multisig.
The complexity scales with the risk but It doesn't NEED to be complex for everyone. I'd say $10k you can get very good relative security with the hardware wallet. It is easy to set up and use and there are tons of vids and material about it.

That may be true, but ethics still matter. If immediate disclosure doesn't have a compelling case to be better for the greater good, AND there is a clear alternative path (there was in this case) that means your choice was unethical and likely selfish.

You don't need to stay in it for a year tho, so why are you stating it like that? I can open a prism and something starts pumping in my portfolio i can close as soon as I hit my profit threshold whatever that is. 12% is only what I pay to keep it ooenyfor the year which i wouldn't do unless I was already up far more than 12%.

Binance announcement mentioned it was a coordinated hijacking of user accounts. 95% of the time phishing is the initial exploit vector when users are initially compromised. My guess is they used a stolen password database they got on the dark web and did credential stuffing attack to determine valid credentials. Then phished the users they had valid credentials for their 2fa codes. It's quite easily automated these days and doesn't even require highly sophisticated attacker.
@_date: 2019-05-07 11:16:25
Technically there is no reason for an upper limit other than safety. With atomic multipath payments, you can make payments of any size by breaking them down into smaller chunks. Think about it like downloading a video on the internet. The video file doesn't arrive in one single IP packet. It is fragmented into thousands or millions of packets and reassembled on the receiving end.
@_date: 2018-12-21 13:03:55
