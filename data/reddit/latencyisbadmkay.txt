It doesn't exist for you, either.  Get over yourself.

This is the most obvious troll post from the comments so far.  Hilarious, really.  But, a total trollfest.
You're at -7 karma at the moment.  It's showtime!  Let's see where this goes.

If I thought I could have a serious conversation on a delicate topic such as the worthlessness of something so expensive (and expected) at the start of a marriage when money is the tightest, I would consider myself very lucky to have a woman who valued the same thing I do.  Long-term stability is for adults while trinkets are for children.  Sitting down to talk about things is also and adult thing to do, so maybe you're just not all that versed in what it means to be an adult.

I was at Butterfly Labs in KC, MO not too long ago and one employee there wouldn't say much except that they are in talks with "large banks", whatever that means.  I would guess they want to replace the shit ACH system with something more modern, at least for internal and interbank transfers of their own wealth.  The Plebs (us) will probably be stuck with ACH for some time to come.

Plot twist: JPM starts using the bitcoin protocol internally because it is superior to the current shitty ACH system.

It's the system they use to transfer currency around the banks.  If you have a direct deposit set up, then this is the system it uses.

Direct deposit is how I do it.  Otherwise, you could send them a check from your account once your employer's check clears.  It's a bank, so you could wire the money to them, but that can get expensive quickly.
