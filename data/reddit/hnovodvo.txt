Did you solve this by running the mnemonic code converter ( to get the missing public/private key? How did you do to get your missing public/private key to import in bitcoin.com?

Excellent Tellestar. 
How do you import the private keys into bitcoin.com wallet?. Did it work without having the private key for the missing transactions?.
I am experiencing the same issue than you had. 
Your help will be highly appreciated.

oh my god!.: ((
transaction appear as unspent output in blockchain.
I saw a different post with similar issue and was solved by importing private keys into bitcoin.com (really dunno how to do that)
Is it possible to get the private key from the public address and the 12 word seed?

Thank you. I tried this and still not working, last transaction is not coming.

Thanks. I already tried the 12 word seed in windows and different wallets and still not working (the last transaction is not showing). I checked the public address in blockchain and the funds are still there. 
The pair public/private key where the funds were sent is not any more in my wallet. How is the procedure for importing private keys into a different wallet. Thanks
