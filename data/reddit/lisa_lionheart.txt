Yeah the fact that all of these cards were using one company as a provider was a bit worrying. Looks like a few of the card companies like TenX and Monaco are cutting out the middleman and starting issue their own cards, which is nice and means they have more control of the design like not having to label the cards as being in a fiat currency

I'm not really an expert but one of the features of lightning is that can be used with other cryptos like litecoin. So a node can do exchanges from one coin to another. Logically if something like rootstock gains traction I'm assuming they will support payment channels as well so you can keep your bitcoin on a side chain and leverage the fact that you get much cheaper transactions.
Technically rootstock bitcoin is a different coin than onchain bitcoin but creating a rootstock token requires locking up bitcoin on the main chain and unlocking requires destroying the rootstock bitcoin. So it's a 1 to 1 relationship.
Someone please correct me if I've got this wrong.

1. You only need to open the channel once.
2. Moving transactions off chain will reduce competition for block space.
3. Potentially you could even use a side chain to open the channel.
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:11:07
Eventually someone will make a hardware lightning wallet or add support to existing products like trezor or ledger so you can sign channel statechanges securely.

You could air drop a new coin with initial distribution based on unspent transactions at a certain point on the bitcoin block chain and then use the same hash algorithm so that bitcoin private keys could now access accounts in the new coin but philosophically is it the same coin? Or are you just defining a one way peg? There is then the issue of getting people to use it and not just continue on with the existing block chain. That would be the most contentious hard fork in bitcoin history I think

The only possible scenario I can see with lightning is that the usage goes up so that opening and closing channels become prohibitively expensive, however there is no reason we can't open channels on side chains and have lightning nodes transparently support main chain and side chain channels as they are both bitcoin

I think you would have to keep them for a very long time without moving them for this to be a problem, like 20+ years.

You should check out the eclair testnet wallet and give it a go, it was fairly easy to get some testnet bitcoin, open a channel and buy some virtual coffee.
What I think will happen is that exchanges will allow you to withdraw/make payments straight from their apps so if you want you can just let them take care of managing channels.
Personally I'm against this as it means you are not in charge of your own keys but I can see how it would be convenient.

I think the most exciting thing about lightning is that once it goes live its going to go live for all coins. You in theory could make a payment int bitcoin from a balance of lite coin by routing through a node that does the conversion for you. It opens up a world of posibility
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:45:26

@_date: 2017-12-26 19:19:16
I think the fact that they suddenly released BCH support without any lead time and then shutdown trading after 3 minutes because it went crazy due high due to there being no liquidity was the problem.

When we get a bitcoin ETF it will be in large part because of them.

Depends if the "wallets location" refers to the record of a given balance or the private key needed to spend that bitcoin.
In the first case all wallets are on all computers running a full bitcoin node simultaneously, which means and bitcoin wallet is in the US
But I'd argue it refers to the private key which is where I would consider the ownership to be vested it exists only in the device storing it or in the mind of the owner in the case of a brain wallet.
From the context seeing that coinsbase are a US company, your coinsbase wallet is in the US.

Sort of. Once you have opened a lightning payment channel you can make near instant payments as long as the channel is open but it will take a regular bitcoin transaction with the normal rules about confirmations and fees.
If it all works as designed and there is widespread adoption then I guess most people will just open a channel and keep it open for as long as they can or until the channel has run out of money. I don't think there is any limit on that.

It was a different era the public had different expectations, the idea that the state should look after the unfortunates is a 20th century invention that is pretty much baked into the idea of the state now. In terms of the us and that period of history, the people of this time were capturing masses untapped natural wealth. Gold in the west, clearances in the heart land, 100000s of square miles of "undeveloped" land to tap into. 
  
You maybe right that a totally hands of approach is better for human potential (I'm very much not convinced) but most people are not willing to live in that sort world. The safety net of having things to fall back on if we were to get ill or suffer an accident is too powerful. You can talk about private charity but I don't think historical examples have ever matched up to the welfare state of most 1st world countries. Of course a one to one charity where the giver knows the recipients needs is nice but it doesn't scale. Private charity often comes with strings attached and can stop at any point.  
Government programs are at least consistent even if there are inefficiencies and corruption, you can present these facts about how we would all be richer if everything was privatised but  even if you are right I don't think that matters. People generally are not willing to shoulder that level of existential risk, being truly free in the way that libertarians talk about is terrifying to everyone but the most rugged individualists.
The central dynamic of society is the struggle between the individual and the group, there is constant tension and if either one side gets the upper hand the result is neither stable or desirable.
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:05:57
Competition is great but there a situations where competition isn't feasible or its substantially more efficient to have public monopoly that would be gained from competition.
Mass transit is the prime example, at a certain point car usage doesn't scale and you need busses, light rail or subways.
These are all massive capital expenditures when companies do invest they will pick routes that are under-serviced so you tend to end up with these oligopolies where companies have carved out little fiefdoms where users really have no choice on provider since where they need to go is only serviced by one company. Its more profitable to not invest in competing with your rivals and to instead rise prices on consumers who need to get somewhere.  
I am a Capitalist but markets and competition are often used as a golden hammer and we have to be mindful every tool has its flaws and is not suitible for  every job

It essentially comes down to the quality of sun that you get and the actual amount of power you are able to generate. 
Given the typically dismal rates you get feeding electricity into the grid my gut feeling is you have got a sweet deal it's just a question of how many units you can support
When I did the math the other day I think an s9 was capable of producing about $450 a month if electricity was free, of course you are going to want to only mine when the sun is up so factor that in. Unless your grid supplier is less than around $0.30 per kWh in which case mine 24/7

Yeah it's a weird situation, I'm making far more money from the growth of bitcoin than my job.
I even did some calculations that if I quit my job and the price kept climbing at at at least 2.4% a week (well below the average of the last 2 years) I could keep living my current lifestyle indefinitely. 
It's a weird situation to be in and I'm immensely grateful to be part of this revolution.
About the only reason I'm not quitting my job right now is that it gives me something to do and I like the people there but it's hard to put up with some of the political bullshit, my boss complains that I come in late and I just look him in the eye and shrug. I try not to be an asshole about it but sometimes I really don't care and I haven't really done much to keep my job but they need me more than I'm being difficult. I do actually work really hard when it's needed and I'm good at my job.
I'm not at the private yachts and lambos level of wealthy but within a year (unless we have another 2013 level crash) I think I'm going to buy a house for cash. I think another recessions coming and credit is going to dry up so there will be a good dip in house prices here.

@_date: 2019-06-22 00:43:37
That argument holds in somewhere undergoing hyperinflation but most places have negligible inflation compared to the gains of the asset being taxed. As a tax regime you have to have something as the base unit of accounting and it make sense to use the national currency.If you are gonna have taxes, taxing capital gains makes as much sense as taxing income.In the UK CGT has its own tax free threshold in the same way that income tax has, if you are holding assets that have gained value, you should make trades to use it up each year so you mitigate the amount of tax you pay when you eventually do cash out. You can save around £2400 per year in GCT payments by deliberately making gains below the threshold.

We should adopt the lower case b as the notation. We can make a fancier version down the road and get it standardized.

It's an open source project.

Balances held in segwit addresses are only at risk if segwit is deactivated and the old pre-segwit rules are applied. That's not going to happen, only nodes that were not updated with segwit (which still exist and still function due to it being a soft fork) consider those sort of transaction as valid. The rest of the network will reject any blocks containing such transactions. Sure you could mine a block with an signatureless "AnyOneCanSpend" transaction and the handful of node that weren't updated to segwit will accept it but nobody will mine a block on top of it so whats the point.
Its just FUD based on an minor technicality that allowed the network to upgrade as a soft fork
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:27:39
Because of the limited supply and the network effect. 
The more people use it the more valuable it becomes. The more valuable it becomes, the more people are drawn to it as a store of value.
That's the crux of it, it's a virtuous cycle.
Add to that all of these new technical improvements and things like bitcoin debit cards and it starts to look viable as a transaction medium as well. When you have that sort of fluidity and the price keeps rising people start to wonder why not go all in?
Where as with USD the fed is pumping out trillions of new currency each year to buy federal debt and global demand is falling as places are switching to yen, gold or euros to trade for oil. USD is going down, GBP is going down, EUR is doing surprisingly well to be fair but the ECB is run by Germans who know how sucky hyperinflation is.
I don't think we are going to see bitcoins take over anytime soon but maybe in another couple of years a small African or South American country will suffer hyperinflation and resort to using bitcoin as the official currency.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:04:02
I would.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:39:18
The thing is the network would be secure enough with even a fraction of the hash rate. The hash rate will always rise and fall with the mining profitability which is "price * (blockreward+fees)"
Not really any way to change that unless we hard-forked away the block reward which I can't see happening.
Bitcoin has just been too successful, I would suggest that we could have set the expansion phase to 10 years rather than 200 and we would not be having these issue and still have adoption.

Honesty I get the feeling that core want to come up with a better solution with lightning network layer rather than slapping a quick fix on it and by having this pressure of people wishing to escape high fees it motivates development and adoption. 
Raising the block size to 2mb would not be that much of a big deal, the argument about block propogation isent a big of a problem as we already have compact blocks that reduces the network usage so it was never going to cause centralisation as was feared. 
That said it's a fools errand​, there is a rule about roads, adding more space (more lanes) paradoxically makes the traffic worse. You will have more space for transactions so people will make more transactions, you need to come up with a better solution or you will just end up paving over everything.
I feel your pain, I think core could have allowed a 2x increase with little penalty and it would have released a bit of contention but I'm with them in terms of long term if we want bitcoin to be usable for all our little transactions we have to move off chain. Scaling up with bigger blocks has no future. And when you have people like Roger Ver holding up "Satoshis vision" like he was the Messiah Alli can do is facepalm. Satoshi did not have all the answers.

Um no. These scenarios don't really make much sense. People won't hold onto their bitcoin when they become multi millionaires even though they will miss out on the chance to become billionaires. Eventually ego, greed or social pressure will cause people to sell their bitcoin so they can buy nice houses and lambos. I don't think anyone is that strong of a holder.
I think the opposite, call me an optimist but bitcoin has the potential to redistribute wealth back to the people and kill the parasitic banks once and for all. Lots of people are buying bitcoin, I've talked to taxi drivers, hairdressers and random people in the pub who are into bitcoin. Yes people who got in first are advantaged but there is still plenty of time to get most people in (even just a bit) we are starting to see it go mainstream this year nearly everyone in my office is investing now, it's crazy. If we do see a hyperbitcoinization event just having dipped a toe in will be worth it.

I like to say everything is a bubble given a long enough timespan. One day every thing ends, people, nations, currencies, the human species, planets, stars and the whole universe. Everything rises, peaks and then goes into decline, some times that decline is very quick, some times the rise is quick and the decline is slow.
The question you have to ask is when will bitcoin peak?
My feeling is that bitcoin or whatever bitcoin evolves into has a very long life span, it will go on beyond all of us alive today. If bitcoin goes into decline it will be because we have found a way to live without money

It's worth adding that the pool operators choose what to signal but there is no way of knowing what the actual participants in that pool are going to do. These are not corporations with a hierarchy controlling every thing.

If you want to to stand out on the street and trade bitcoin for cash then go for it. More power to you. I think there are plenty of options for this.
From my experience trading on local bitcoin by accepting bank transfers you opened yourself to a whole mess of trouble if you didn't do KYC for you own protection. I had bank accounts frozen twice because funds sent to me were from hacked online banking accounts. 
Trust me I don't like it, I wish bank transfers were as imutable as bitcoin or there were better options for avoiding fraud but unless you are in face to face situations with cash or other bearer tokens you are taking huge risks by not doing KYC that go beyond fear of the government.
I totally get local bitcoins decisions, they have decided to focus on the highly regulated market of bank transfers for crypto as it's much larger than cash and they can jettison a whole messy segment which probably generated far more support requests which were hard to process as there is basically no paper trail to resolve disputes about escrows (99% of support tickets)
In my mind the world of online transfers and cash markets are very different and offering escrow services for cash doesn't make any sense so I can see why they would look to get out of it.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:25:08
This is not true. So long as the unspent transaction database is valid and you have the hash of the last block you can validate any future transaction correctly.
When you restart bitcoind (even without pruning) it doesnt revalidate the entire blockchain it checks the unspent transactions database and resumes from the last commited block.

I spent the first ten years of my life in West London, my best friend was a Hindu girl and we had plenty of Sihks, Muslims, Catholics and protestants in our school. 
I really appreciated growing up around lots of different people but I pretty quickly realized that they can't all be right, someone has to be wrong.
My parents are nice middle class lefty Anglican types who preach a lot about tollerance so when I asked them about contradictions between the religions I encountered it's really funny watching the mental gymnastics trying to explain how "there are many paths to God" but personally I saw my mother say some rather intolerance and patronising stuff about non Christians (and even other sects)
When you realise the odds are you are in the wrong religion it's not far to work out they are all wrong

Honestly, I think if bitcoin survives long term it will outlive the US dollar as a currency. So there isn't really a maxium limit as the dollar will always keep inflating until people abandon it or it gets replaced with New Dollars or something. In this case the question has no meaningful answer.
If bitcoin doesn't survive it will be because a different cryptocoin with fixed supply displaces it due to it working better in a technical way that cannot be transplanted into bitcoin. This depends on techincal developments as to when the tip over point happens and the new coin becomes the top crypto.

Potentially your channel can remain open indefinitely so it's probably just going to be a one time thing. I think a lot of the details could be hidden to the user and that what ever wallet you have would show you how much you have spendable as a single number regardless of how many channels you have open.
Topping up your balance would be analogous to moving funds to a hot wallet like now but in fact would be opening new channels.

Depends on your appetite for risk. If it goes to zero and you couldn't get out in time how are you going to feel? 
There are going to be dips, if they happen before you have seen gains then you are going to want to panic sell to stop your losses. This is always been a bad idea but it's an emotional response that every newbie has.
I cant tell you what to do but going "full bitcoin" is something that requires an extremely firm hand to not end up doing something stupid at the first sign of panic. Be prepared to loose sleep and become obsessed with price watching.

The block subsidy creates mining compition. The network could be essentially as secure with significantly less miners but because the price is so high market forces will drive people to mine more until it reaches equilibrium between cost and income.
This and things like people getting black market electricity in China mean it is a bit out of control right now.
I would argue that this electricity is not wasted it is doing something important we just need governments to either regulate out fossil fuels and set rules when they subsidies electricity so the market isen't so distorted.
None of this will stop it from reaching 10k though

I don't know. I mean I've tried cocaine its fun for parties, but I've seen what heroine and meth do to people and its fucking awful.
I feel like rather than locking up addicts in prison we should save the money it costs to lock someone up and put them in rehab and try to address the social problems that meant they wanted to destroy themselves with drugs in the first place. 
I think if we somehow managed to enact a perfect system that eliminated the drug trade people would kill themselves by drinking or eating themselves into a grave. I believe drugs are the symptoms of the real underlying psycho-social disease that is spreading through the west.
The problem with the "war on drugs" is the fact that it creates a vicious cycle of incentives where every time the cops bust a drug dealer the street price of drugs goes up and that dealer is quickly replaced by someone more violent and more willing to do heinous shit. Also now we have synthetic drugs which are way worse but more popular because they are easier to make in backstreet "labs" and the purity is shit and they will kill you faster but they are easier to get hold of.
In a compassionate world we would have a regulated drug market where the drugs are pure and don't cost so much but there are rules and your supplier will try and push you to go to state sponsored rehab if you are becoming an addict and they push health warning on people about the dangers of drugs so they make better choices.

You can sell on a GBP exchange like coinfloor.co.uk and then withdraw to a UK bank.
People make large transfers all the time when they sell property so one large transfer is not that unusual. Worse case you are going to have to talk to your bank if they put a hold on it, just stay calm and work with them. 
How did you get 50 BTC? If you brought​ it previously you will need to pay capital gains tax on the difference between purchase and sale price, the "gains". You will have to file a tax return the year you sell.
If you mined it you need to work out the fair market value the day you received the payout and declare that as income as well as the capital gains since that time.

The 2 most common thing that people wish of government is lower taxes and higher spending. These two things are at odds. You can't logically do both unless you go into debt. Now some debt is fine but its a situation where all the benefits are upfront and the draw backs are long term.
When you have elections every 4 years politicians will make promises based on the assumption that they will be gone after a period of time. So you get a bias towards these sort of short term gains with inflated long term costs.
Fiat currency makes this worse as you can instruct the central bank to artificially keep interest rates down making borrowing money artificially cheaper than it should this leads to a run away creation of debts, since [Money *IS* Debt]( in a fiat system this leads to an expansion in the money supply and inflation of prices. 
Eventually you get to a situation like pre-2008 where there was a massive "house of cards" style debt pyramid, when one debt is defaulted on it has a knock on effect on thye lender of that debt, they end up defaulting on their debts and so on and so on.

You should read more about the technology and realise that nobody can "cheat" the system it's impossible.
The innovation in the bitcoin is it solves the problem of everybody agreeing what is true without having any one central authority.
This is revolutionary stuff. Yes it can be a little scarry when nobody I in charge but it means there can be no corruption of the bitcoin itself. your bitcoin is safe, wether people assign value to it is a more complicated question.

I think you need the private keys to sign the new settlement transaction each time each time funds are moved so it would be very clunky if you had to push a physical button to accept the new channel state.
What I think will happen is that wallets will allow you to open a channel using funds from a hardware wallet and then generate a new private key in the wallet just for that channel. That way you don't need your hardware attached to make spends and if the channel gets nuked or you loose your phone the funds will get returned to the hardware wallet I suspect you will have to wait for the lightning node to decide to force close the channel in that case.
This is all possible I think with the current trezor and ledger APIs it just needs someone to build a lightning wallet that does this.

Because the way the price is rising its more profitable to just hodl bitcoin rather than spend a lot of money trying to get one of these super in demand miners with a huge markup.

Just look where all the technical talent is going, look at the talks from the scaling bitcoin conference. Loads of effort is being put into building out scale in bitcoin and none of it involves bigger blocks.
BCH is a simplistic answer to a really complex problem so it appeals to the non technical people who don't understand how increasing the block size is only good for a little bit of growth before the problems associated with it make it a nightmare.
Given this and bad actors with their own agenda spreading FUD and making wild accusations of censorship I'm not surprised is the hot mess it is.
As for BCH I can see it getting a bit of a pump in the short term but long term as new technical developmenta come online it's a dead duck, they have no real developers. All they have managed to do is hold back a change, increase the block size and fuck around with DAA. It's nothing compared to all the stuff coming from core and it's supporters.

My experience with cards like this is the effective rate you get is often wildly different to market rates. You should be careful they will have a fee schedule that will say one thing but they rarely say definitively where the rate you get is coming from.
There are so many visa cards now we should start some sort of comparison site which lists the actual rate observed compared to some average of the big exchanges.

I zoomed out really far on a log graph and drew a line along touching the biggest dips and extrapolated on that.
I look at the news around bitcoin and I think it's just more of the same so I don't expect any sort of reversal. I expect there will be some sort of crisis in the next year but it won't be big enough to stop this train now, the market cap is so big that it takes bigger and bigger movements to move the price.
Just look at the dip when China banned the exchanges. It looks like a tiny blip now on the weekly charts.

Crashes happen because of panic when something unexpected happens, we've known about this for months so it's already priced in.
If people believe it's going to crash it's almost gaurenteed not to as they will be positioning themselves to buy at the drop.

With bitpay basically yeah. But in the end it makes more sense to pay all of your expenses (mortage, utilities etc) straight from your paycheck and then convert the rest or hold it in fiat if the market is bearish.
I was "all in" for a while, the only fiat I had was spare change but that's a bit scary and I lost my nerve watching the value of my savings bounce around so wildly.
I like wirex because they are basically like a bank but you have accounts in a number of cryptos as well as USD, EUR, GBP and they issue a debit card so it's all you need to keep one foot in the traditional banking system. Obviously the down side is that it's a custodial wallet but I don't keep much in the way of crypto there just fiat.

In 30 years time what we call bitcoin maybe very different from what it is now. Blockchain is great but it has serious limits to scale. Wether we go with a second layer solution or look to something radically different like IOTA change will have to happen by necessatity.
I'm not a fan of bcash or segwit2x it seems like sticking your head in the sand and pretending blockchains can just get bigger and bigger without any issue but I don't think we will ever get 100% concensus for the important improvements of the future because people always have different interests.
What I do know is that miners don't have as much power as they would like you to think. If people don't value the coins on a fork mining will not be profitable and they will be forced into adopting the chain that holds value by  simple economics 
People should just hold on and then decide which they think is the better coin. Both can exist without the sky falling.

If your machine or printer are connected to the network its possible one or more of them are compromised. I've not heard of any malware in the wild that is doing this automatically so far. So its extremely unlikely you are going to create a wallet and have it hacked but it is technically possible.
As long as you're confident that your machine is clean and you are not using a network printer that is publicly accessible IE connected to a WiFi network that lots of people use you are probably fine. If you are comfortable using a linux live bootable USB I would suggest that's a good idea.

First of every miner has different costs as they are in different locations with different electricity sources. So it would have to drop a lot to shake off all the miners.

No I disagree. Okay there are a lot of shitcoins that don't offer anything more to the ecosystem but there are also a lot of intesting innovations happing because it's is easier to create a new coin than update an established one.
Litecoin has been a test bed for a lot of things that made it into bitcoin most recently segwit.
Etherium is doing something completely orthogonal to bitcoin the development of smart contracts is a fascinating idea.

I think in the future hardware wallets will be cheap and abundant and function entirely independently of any other hardware and be secured by biometrics.
All people need to know is that the device contains a balance and they can send from that device by scanning a barcode or swiping it near an NFC reader and hitting confirm on the device.
I disagree that people just need to know the technical details when bitcoin hits the mainstream companies will have already made it safe and secure.
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:36:48
Defiantly technically possible but I think there is a huge risk that the transaction data maybe lost or a future upgrade to smart contracts on bitcoins makes the transaction invalid. If this happens the bitcoin is lost forever.
If you are trying to enforce your will power perhaps a lower tech solution that only presents a barrier that if you really need to you can physically break is a better option.

A few years at least. Until businesses start using bitcoin as a "unit of account" IE keeping money they received as payment in bitcoin rather than converting to fiat it wont happen and for that to happen volatility need to drop down to something along the lines of parity with foreign exchange markets.
It will happen eventually as bitcoin grows and the depths of the exchange markets increases, we just need to have enough people in the exchanges ready to buy or sell to help smooth out the volatility spikes that we see.
Basically the less volatile the market the less often you need to update your prices, right now you would be changing every day if not every hour but once it gets down to once every month or 2 I think it would be viable

No the deciding factor in fees is block contention. Even if most of the miners get eliminated as unprofitable the network will adapt and drop the difficulty back down. Its fine as long as one group doesn't get more than 50% of the hashing power.

The incentive is for miners to hang on as long as they can so I expect them to try and bribe/evade/stonewall the authorities resulting in a tapering rather than it falling of a cliff.

Bitcoin. Because getting fiat money out is much easier than getting money into bitcoin.
Once your money is in crypto it's more liquid, you can trade into other things like USDT and alt coins if bitcoin is in a bear market and you can use bitcoin debit cards to pay basically anywhere.

The amount of electricity used is linked to the amount of reward from mining a block via the difficulty mechanism. Currently 12.5 btc for the reward and about 1.5-3 btc for the fees so around $50k a block. At $10 per MWh thats 5 GWh of electrictiicto break even 
Once the block reward tapers off and the majority of transaction occur off chain it will become less profitable to mine so the difficulty will have to adjust downwards thus less computation per block
Also if you are mining bitcoin, its a fairly constant and predictable load I think a lot of mining is going to move off grid using renewable  like solar or hydro which have high up front costs but no fuel costs

A volume normalized mid market rate across all exchanges and then a display about how much each varies from the MMR.
Display of the relative size of the order books wether there are more bids than asks and to be able to represent that over time, I think it's interesting sometimes.
Display of the price of the different currency pairs as an equivalent value in fiat of your choice. IE how much the Chinese are paying versus the Europeans and the American etc in equivalent euros, dollars etc
A guy posted an idea the other day which was kind of cool, calculate for any time the number of days since that price was an all time high. IE today would be about a month as the price at this time was ath in early august. Obviously depends on exchange but you could calculate it based on MMR

I think that central banks will eventually want to create their own crypto coins. They would control the supply of them and peg it to the existing currency at 1-1. At first it would just be inter-bank transfers but it will expand.
The question how ever is will countries tolerate competing currency?

@_date: 2017-09-07 17:33:52
Yeah this.
Sure node can prune blocks after verifying them thus sorting the storage issue but at 0.5gb a block network speed and the slower propagation of blocks across the network becomes huge, potentially chain rewrites would become more common meaning we would need to wait for even more confirmations.
*If we want bitcoin to scale, off chain settlement is the only option.*
I think all the concern about "centralization" is FUD since anyone with the BTC to back channel creation will be able to run their node and the entire system is trust-less anyway.
My only concern with LN is that node operators are unlikely to be willing to create 2 way channels with users unless they have a good reason too. Creating a 2 way channel requires backing that channel with BTC and if you operate a public node you may have a lot of users connecting wanting 2 way channels and you may not have the funds to cover it. The way I see this playing out is that most nodes will only accept one-way "incoming" connections from leaf nodes and then establish 2 way connections with other hub nodes. I suspect merchants will have to explicitly register with a HUB to get incoming payments, operate their own nodes or accept a fee to pay for the cost of backing a channel

- Instability in south america, driving people to alternative currencies

- Proliferation of bitcoin debit cards as a viable means of making bitcoin a currency for everyday usage
- Bitcoin ATMs are now a common sight in major cities.

What does that mean? One person's sale is another's purchase

Chances are if you brought the bitcoin at an exchange it passed through a wallet with a large balance that basically means its connected to millions of coinbase
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:54:33
No because the elites will adopt bitcoin before the masses. The people who loose out will be the technophobes and old people left holding the bag.
I think now that institutions are getting into bitcoin a ban is pretty much unthinkable.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:04:08
To be fair, BTC is quite volatile so you cant gaurentee to them that you wont be down 20% by the time it comes to pay the deposit

Why have taxes then if we can just print as much money as we need? We could pay of the debt and have as much money as we need. It worked well in Zimbabwe and I hear it's going great there now.

If they do it they would have it used to top up your gift card balance. Refunds can go into that balance and they often try to give you something like audible credits if you accept their gift card balance rather than paying back to your card so it makes sense.
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:54:09
When the market is bullish I spend on a credit card and then sell bitcoin at the end of the month to pay the bill and rent. It's a hassle but I make like an extra discount on my purchases.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:53:06
Not if they like staying in buisnes they won't. Can you imagine the confusion if they say they take bitcoin but actually only take a forkcoin

What's the news from Venezuela then are there significant numbers of people using bitcoin to buy things or is it still nieche/only used for remittance? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:22:50
How big of a dip is a dip for you? It's dropped like 5-8% for a few days several times then risen higher. In my mind those were the dips!
Remember when China banned bitcoin and it dropped 30% for a few days then recovered, that's about a big a dip as you are going to see now and it's going to need some serious bad news to cause people to panic sell like that.
Bitcoin 2017 is a lot tougher than bitcoin 2013

No. I work as a software engineer and in a company of 50 very technical people I am the only one who owns any and only about  a 3rd have maybe heard about it.

@_date: 2017-10-06 08:14:17
Ask to be paid in bitcoin. Get a bitcoin debit card. Close your bank accounts.

There is a client and server you can play around with on testnet, it's functional. I expect march next year maybe it will start being deployed and integrated into existing services and going live.
Expect it will take another year or so for most wallets  to support it but the technical challenges have been solved
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:59:10
It would be a disaster of a scale never seen in human history but there would be enough surviving copies of the blockchain and hopefully people made paper backups of their keys and seed words so eventually we could recover.

Buy enough fiat to cover expenses for a few weeks and then holding through the uncertainty and hope the combined value of both coins is worth at least as much as it is now.
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:40:45
Whats the interest on the loan. I would take care of the debt first. It's possible your bitcoins could outpace the interest of the loan but it's risky. You need to work out how much bitcoin would need to rise versus how much the interest earned on the loan is to make a judgement call

Nah this is defiantly the ironic usage stage.
Comparing the last month or previous bubbles suggests that this is not a bubble. In december 2013 the price went up 80% in 2 weeks, the last 80% climb took almost 8 months. Nobody seems particularly delusional, looking at the whole of this year it a fairly smooth climb with the odd surge and correction pattern.

Cool. I understand the concern, it would be preferable if we could scale up the current model and make it faster but I don't see a way to do it with in the block-chain paradigm.

Maybe bitcoin will become the main currency in smaller nations if the value ever stabilizes but I cannot see big nations like the US willing to give up control of the money supply.
More likely central banks will start holding bitcoin as a reserve and using it for international trade.

Yes a lot of early adopters have managed to take a disproportionate amount of coins but I do not see this as a problem as eventually the allure of amassed fortune will cause them to get lazy and spend the coins or gamble them away. Dont expect this to continue past 1 additional generation at the most.
True wealth is kept in place by the corrupt monetary system, those who control the creation of money will always use it to enrich themselves at the expense of others. The real wealth in the old system is held in place by finance and those cozy with the state. Bitcoin destroys that possibility and levels the playing field with an untamperable sound money
Without the constant grind of inflation it will be easier for those with the ability to rise and carve out a piece of the world for themselves.
Maybe this is utopian thinking but I think bitcoin has the potential to level the playing field and bring a fairer distribution of the world's wealth. This is a long way of when bitcoin is mature and the growth phase has slowed.

I don't think a financial collapse will ever be that apocalyptic nobody is going to die and non of the infrastructure will be destroyed.
In the event of hyperinflation or a sudden contraction of the money supply due to a debt crisis having bitcoin around will actually help to mitigate the worst effects. People will be able to switch over to getting paid and paying for things in bitcoin  it will suck, people will lose there life savings but people wont have to panic about wheel barrels full of money to buy bread or having money loose half its value in a day

If things continue as is I could buy a reasonable house here for cash within 2 or 3 years. But I don't know what the central bank is going to do regarding rates and I don't know for certain we are going to see another 400% in the next few years. All this uncertainty is paralyzing to be honest.

Without any context you are not presenting any evidence that you haven't been a complete ass in previous interactions.
When you agree to the localbitcoins terms and conditions you agree to their arbitration and that their decisions are final. Refusing to accept a decision that you agreed to accept in the TOS is a whiney bitch move and I'm not surprised they have decided to cut you of.
I have conducted 100s of trades and have had a dozen or so disputes on platform I've always treated the staff with respect even when stuff went wrong and I've only have a couple of really bad situations where it didn't work out.

Its meaningless since you are supposed to use a new address for every transaction. Personal my hodlings are split over dozens of addresses. 
Also its unknown how many of these addresses are lost, I suspect if you excluded addresses that have had no transactions for more that 5 years you would get a very different picture.

Apart from the ideological reasons, being a bank requires a lot of money and considering the hostility of traditional banks to bitcoin businesses it might not succeed anyway.
An exchange isn't equivalent to a bank anyway its a "money transmitting service" or a brokerage. Both of which have different and much easier to deal with regulations.
Being a bank means getting to bed with the central bank and becoming part of the system that bitcoin is apposed to.
One day maybe there will be businesses that hold people private keys behind layers of physical security and call themselves "banks" but thats not what a bank is in 2017

Their bank is in Belize so you can't even do a SEPA Transfer you need to do an international wire. It's not clear where in the world their actual offices are, if you try and dig in to the company structure it looks really suspect.
Their "exchange" is nearly entirely bots that they use to control both sides of the order book. If you use their visa card the rates are aweful like 15% over/under what you would expect. 
They may publish a large volume but I'm sure that it's fake or that they are the only people with orders on the system. You just have to watch their market screen on their site and you will see very few trades and very weird movement on the order book.
I was using them for a while but I came to the conclusion they are a scummy company who will try and milk you for as much as they can get away with.
If you want to trade BTCGBP I would suggest coin floor or localbitcoins.
I really would suggest you stay away from them, they won't steal your money but you will be gouged by a rigged market.

It doesn't make a good unit of account, I would not recommend setting prices in bitcoin as you would have to update them far too often. This will eventually change when it gets bigger but for now it's more like digital gold, a store of value.
Personally it's gotten to the point where spending it is easy enough with all these visa cards that it can be used to buy things and be a replacement for a bank account.

I don't know but coins bank has been good so far. You can spend directly from the BTC balance and the fees are minimal. Also if you want to you can sell your bitcoin at a time of your choosing in and then spend that balance first so you get the best rate.
They have their own exchange but it does not have much liquidity so often the price can be quite volatile. But if you are smart you can use that to your advantage.

It's not a productive asset so those early adopters will eventually spend it all or invest it back into the economy.
If you had a billion dollars do you think you would work hard to manage that money? Or would you live it up for the rest of your life.
Concentration of wealth is a problem when it occurs with real world property because having lots of productive assets allows you to earn passive incomes that entrench wealth into dynasties. This is generally why we have inheritence tax and land/property tax to stop that getting out of control.
Generally speaking it's very hard to hold onto wealth without working at it or participating in the fraud that is the banking system.

Money laundering requires you to construct a convincing lie about how you obtained such large amounts of cash. If you received bitcoin anomously you haven't explained how and why you have that money. 
Most money laundering involves cash buisnesses where you created fake sales. You could do that with bitcoin but it would be very suspicious. Actual cash is a better option for money laundering.

Issuing your own currency is pretty much a must for an upstart nation but you would be pretty foolish to not go fiat. You will need to pay government workers to implement independence so pretty much the only way to do so is by issuing something that you promise to back at some point in the future and have it pegged to the euro and hope there is enough optimism in the people that you don't suffer a run on the new currency.
Using bitcoin would be impossible as they have no money to buy bitcoin with in the first place. The first thing that the Spanish government will do is shutdown the banking network.
That said using block chain to issue a currency like Tether where supply is controlled by the catalan government would be a good way of doing it. No need to mint coins and notes.

Lol just because you can count through every possible permutation does not mean you can do anything with it.
It's like you can iterate through all the possible 16 digit visa card numbers and try and steal someone's money. Each attempt has a time cost so by the time you are likely to find a valid one by chance the universe would be over.
As for quantum computers, that's still a decade away from being a reality and there are already hash functions that are resistant to that sort of attack so we could upgrade bitcoin long before a quantum attack becomes viable

We can always upgrade the protocol to add more units below Satoshi's so as long as some quantity still exists in circulation the system is still usable.
Potentially down the road devs could introduce a network upgrade that recycles "dead" coins IE unspent outputs older than some cut off point but I really don't like that idea. I would rather prune them from the UTXO database so they are not taking up space and split the live coins down further.

Back in the old time the rich were industrialists and merchants today they are financiers and bankers. The difference is the money system 
Bitcoin won't fix income inequality but at least it will end the fraudulent banking system that transfers wealth to the bankers 
Edit: I realize if you look at the richest individual then yes they are nearly all people who built their own business empires. But as a whole the percentage of wealth made by finance is way up

I've been reading pretty much everything here and elsewhere and have good understanding of the technical aspects of bitcoin 
I understand why the miners want larger blocks now and understand and somewhat agree to cores position that its not necessary **yet** but all the arguments that this is a "corporate takeover" or that this will weaken bitcoin seem ridiculous and are not backed by any evidence.
Okay yeah bigger blocks will make it more costly to run a bitcoin node in terms of bandwidth and such, but most nodes are run in data centers with fat pipes as long as different groups are running their own nodes (which every single bitcoin business is doing) it doesn't matter if we have 5000 nodes or 50 the number of nodes doesn't actually matter so long as we maintain availability, the block chain is secured by proof of work not the dispersion of nodes.
In my eyes this is just a colossal game of chicken over something that is way less important than the risk of a contentious hard for merits, it seems to be more symbolic fight over who gets to dictate which way bitcoin goes. I wish the parties in this would just talk and work something out rather than slaming each other on social media, its pathetic.

Keeping the keys to large holdings is like keeping gold in a safe. It can be stolen.
If you are wanting to keep safe a large fortune there are plenty of options that are pretty much bullet proof.

Get a bitcoin debit card, often with the cashback rewards + the rate they give it can give you its cheaper than spending the equivalent in fiat currency.
For example I use coins bank with a GBP card and they give 1% cashback (it comes from merchant fees) and there rates for some reason seem to fluctuate up to 6% above the equivalent bit-stamp USD price. 
The net effect is if you spend via coinsbank VISA and buy in via bitstamp you come out ahead.

The only way is a complete financial crash occurred and the dollar became worthless like the Zimbabwean dollar, even then it would only be used if bitcoin had the same sort of mass market adoption that the dollar had in Zimbabwe.

"private blockchain" is an oxymoron.
I agree central banks will definitely create their own blockchain based currencies but the whole point of a blockchain is to be publicly auditable. Also doing so will end private banking because once it becomes widespread there is no point to letting a third-party key your private keys.

Laundering money means you have constructed a fabricated story about how you obtained the money legally.
If you start spending criminal money via bitcoin debt card you still haven't constructed a cover of why someone without an obvious source of income can buy all the things you have. People get caught because it looks very suspicious if you have lots of nice stuff and aren't paying any taxes. Bitcoin is no different to cash.
Walter white had a storage locker full of cash that he could not spend even though it was arguably more anonymous than bitcoin, had to buy a car wash and fake customers to make it seem legit.

I think maybe you need to examine why you want to even sell. For me the only reason I would sell bitcoin is to make a large purchase (like a house or a car). Whats the point of selling just to have a large number of dollars or pounds?
The point that changed my mind was when I calculated the effective interest rate of my banks savings rate (listed rate minus inflation) I realized that by holding cash I was loosing 2.5% a year where as bitcoin has consistently yielded huge growth. This is only going to get worse when the drop the rates below zero. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that traditional money is stable, its declining at a rate worthy enough of concern.
Now that I have a bitcoin debit card and my city has 2 bitcoin atms I feel a lot more comfortable holding larger amounts of bitcoin as I can spend them when the price seems over inflated and but more when it dips.
I've been in this for years and I am utterly convinced that either bitcoin will continue forever or a new crypo will take its place in which case I will switch to that one. I don't think western governments will ever ban it and even if they did it would still retain most of its value and there would be enough time to get out or move to gold or something.

At first, I was going to say that this would be absolutely crazy for a country to give up its own currency for something like bitcoin but actually, all it would be would be returning to the economics before the 20th century when countries operated on the gold standard.
It would be hard to get back into that mindset where you can only spend what you have, raising extra revenue would involve issuing bonds but for countries where they have seen years of constant grinding inflation I can see how it could start to look appealing

I think its unlikely each vending machine would keeps its only copy of the block chain. That task would be farmed off to a back end server, and that would be servicing multiple machines. Since the server is in a data centre it would be "close" to other bitcoin hosts that are serving other POS systems. Once any of them sees a transaction they have all effectively seen it.
 
Once you've got one confirmation your good.
As this develops I think NFC payments are gonna be big, the advantage with this is that vending machine can receive the signed transaction directly, once you have that and you know their public address has the fund its pretty much 100% safe. The vendor can insert the transaction in the block chain on be half of the consumer who doesn't even need an internet connection. Once its accepted by its peers it can vend the product.

Look at the price at OkCoin + BTCC (Honk Kong and China exchange) and the price on (bitFlyer Japan) versus (Bitstamp EU) and (Coinbase US) you can see the Asian exchanges are leading the price up.
This makes sense considering the recent good new regarding the legal status of bitcoin in China and Japan.
Japan has recently declared bitcoin and other cryptos as legal tender giving a lot of legitimacy to them, couple this with the idea that Bitcoin is a Japanese invention and the long history of japans dire stagflation its made a perfect storm of adoption
In China, for a long time, it was in a legal limbo, it looks like the Chinese government is going to allow it going forwards. Lots of the newly created middle class are looking for investments and a way to carry wealth outside of the country bypassing chinas restrictive capital controls.

Seems like the next logical step for banks.
You could create a clone of the bitcoin protocol that instead of using mining, has a "mint" address that starts with an infinite amount of coins, the central bank is the holder of the private key for that address and offers exchange for paper dollars to new electronic bitdollars at a fixed exchange rates efficiently making "bitdollars" and extension of the dollar.
Then it would could gradually transition everyone over to this new system from existing electronic banking systems which are hugely complicated and expensive to maintain.
I think there us huge demand for this sort of secure electronic cash

Just being a dongle you can plug into any USB lowers the adoption barrier so much, most POS systems are just a computer anyway. I had been thinking about smart card based signing but this is so much simpler.
All you need is 30 mBTC USB cable/hub and some software and you are setup to receive bitcoins securely and efficiently.
How long do transaction take? Seeing as the the host machine is getting first look at the signed transaction, confirmations would be effectively instant right?

When theres more liquidity the hour to hour swings will be less sever and when it reaches saturation IE when everyone owns some bitcoin the price should stabilise and continue to grow at a very slow yearly rate.
This is the down side of deflation but people still need to buy things to live, we don't all sit in unfurnished houses with our stock piles of money we spend knowing our purchases maybe be cheaper tomorrow but we still want them today.
Bitcoin is going through a massive growth phase at the moment so it does make more sense to hoard, personally I see it as my own savings account (with way better returns)

I agree with you to a point, at the moment its still very wild west. 
Copying a bitcoin address to your client and typing in the right number is a tad clunky, but we're working on it, QR codes are better, I don't see how these things are nessesarily harder than credit card payments. Yeah and no one has yet explored bitcoin based visa cards or paper money backed by bitcoin.
Keeping your life savings in bit coin on your computer is no different to keeping cash in your mattress. Without the right security measures its dumb. 
I think there will be starting soon a bit coin savings and loans, it makes sense that we start to building these institutions now. Grampa shouldn't keep any more cash in his house than is safe, he should invest it somewhere where it will earn interest.

Very cool but I want a debit card that I can use in shops that don't accept bitcoin. Thats the missing link 
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:23:03
1. Create a new wallet with blockchain.info or the bitcoin-qt client.
2. Transfer all the funds to the address of the new wallet by using the withdrawal feature of coinbase.
3. Then backup the wallet to a file and store that on your usb key.
edit: If you do do that I recommend making several secure backups
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:30:36
I recommend localbitcoins.com, sure its feels a bit dodgy sending somebody money from your online banking but Ive done it 3 times now without a single hitch.
The prices arent too bad, maybe 1% more than mtgox but there are no fees unless you are posting a trade. It works out cheaper than mtgox as you wont get hit by bank fees for sending money internationally. And its fast typically clears under an hour.
edit: I just realised physical bit coin, I'm not smart. Also TIL physical bitcoins are a thing

Not disagreeing with you, bitcoin could potentially do those things better in the future but the UK systems work better today. 
As for ATMS that charge, I and a lot of people refuse to use them as there is always a free one close enough by that its not an issue.
Most people don't send money enough abroad often enough that they worry about the cost, obviously this is where bitcoin shines today.

I deposited money in bitstamp from via SEPA from a halifax account and it cleared within 2 hours. This was during the day in buisness hours but its still pretty good.

It will only start being a currency if I can use it in day to day life, right now I can send coins to my friends with my phone but its far from practical for use in shops. Right now running pure bitcoin payments in retail environments is painful as you have to wait for funds to get x number of confirmations which is slow. At least with traditional money you can conduct a transaction in 30 seconds and be confident the money was received.
I really hope someone can offer a technical solution to this, as right now I cant see how waiting 10 minutes for confirmations is viable
Someone needs to offer a credit card service that you can pay off at the end of the month with bitcoins, or even a debit card you can top up with bitcoins and its converted to local currency when you pay with it.

You can use web inspector to re-enable to the submit button to get around agreeing to it. All it does is toggle the enable state on the button.
That said I have an outstanding wire transfer from before this option appeared so I will be interested to see if I can withdraw as BTC when it clears.
