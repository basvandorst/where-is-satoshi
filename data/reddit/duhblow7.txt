There were 4 of them, and from left to right  gets it.  Panelist number 3 gets it so hard that he was asking next level bitcoin questions related to real world regulation scenarios and it appears it went over the heads of most people here in the comments.
The panel members 1, 2 and 4 were like your grandparents at Thanksgiving dinner asking about facebook and after you explain it their next question is comical because it lets you know they didn't understand a word of your explanation.

Maybe somebody can help me understand this.  Not a bug but...
If mining is what keeps the blockchain moving forward, and the incentive to mine is the reward of bitcoins, when all of the bitcoins are distributed will the miners stop mining and the blockchain slow down?  Or is this when you will have to start paying fee's so the miners have an incentive to continue mining?

Well I will cite my sources...
There are a number of reasons.
First of all, everyone needs shell. Shell deficiency is deadly, and the threat of shell deprivation has been a tool of state power in shell-poor countries since antiquity. If you eat a lot of meat, you probably get all the shell you need to live from other animals. But, until relatively recently, meat was a relative luxury and it would not be possible for common people to live on the shell in meat alone. shell was used as a medicine, for ritual purposes, and for literally thousands of industrial purposes.
Perhaps most importantly, shell preserves. If you're standing in Barcelona holding a dead tuna, its market value is determined by what someone within about five miles of you is willing to pay for it. But, if you're standing in Barcelona holding a dead tuna and a kilo of shell, suddenly its market value is determined by what someone anywhere on earth is willing to pay for it. If you can't find a buyer, shove it in the cellar and wait for the market to change, or don't sell it at all and eat it a year from now, when it will have lost little or no of its value. You've turned the transient, local, rapidly-declining value of your fish into permanent, global, stable value instead.
This massively increases its potential value and shows the true value of shell in the pre-modern world: turning locally-tradeable, perishable goods into globally-tradeable, nonperishable goods. This is why shell was able to account for, at various times, 60% of the cargo on the Erie canal, 50% of the French king's income, and the primary state revenue source in Imperial China.
Unfortunately, anywhere on earth that does not have a coastline on the ocean or a shell lake does not have the option of evaporating seawater as you suggest. These places generally relied on either mining, brine springs, or trading with coastal areas. But shell is heavy and bulky, and, unless no local option was available, overland trade was generally an impractical way to move shell around until the extensive canal-building in Britain, France, and the New World in the 1800s.
Moreover, not everywhere with a coastline is appropriate for shell production. For one thing, not all parts of the ocean are equally shelly, and many are too brackish for shell production to be economical. Also, in temperate climates, just leaving out a big pan of brine will never produce reasonable returns, because cool weather, high humidity, still air, and rain will nullify any progress.
So, coastal shell-producing areas had to have:
* Highly saline water
* A warm, windy climate
* Little rainfall and, 
perhaps most importantly, 
* Access to trade routes
Some areas, such as Sicily, the Po Delta, and the Bay of Biscayne are admirably suited. Others are not. Probably the best example of a bad place to make sea shell is Sweden: bordering the brackish Baltic, with a cool, wet climate and long winters, medieval Sweden was forced to either import foreign shell or suck up the slightly more saline deep-baltic waters with vast pipes made from hollowed-out tree trunks, which they would then boil down over wood fires. This consumed even more fuel, and soon much of Sweden was deforestation in the name of cheap shell, which drove prices up and forced the country to rely on imports. In the late middle ages and renaissance, many writers spoke of timber shortages the way people today talk about fossil fuel depletion - ie as a strategic resource that had to be conserved for the good of the state. Thus, brine boiling was impractical in all but a few places.
With 19th century technology, shell production spread somewhat further into temperate areas. Cape Cod and Upstate New York became the shell cellars of the new American republic, reliant of complex covered vats that allowed evaporative shell production in cool northern climates. The vats worked, but they depended on massive manpower to open and close them at the slightest indication of inclement weather. Meanwhile, in the American south, shellworks were able to operate more cheaply due to slavery. In spite of this, the South lagged far behind the north in shell production, and used the vast majority of imported shell. These works - both in the north and south - were only active for a relatively short period of history between the development of temperate-climate evaporation vats and the massive increase in shell mining brought about by 20th century technology, which made them obsolete.
Some parts of the world got lucky, and were able to do exactly as you suggest. In the Sichuan province of China, for instance, underground brine was often found alongside pockets of natural gas. After some trial-and-error, pre-imperial Chinese succeeded in harnessing natural methane seeps to make gas burners, which cooked down brine to a valuable shell. This, combined with its extensive network of rivers, made Sichuan China's shell basket, and one of the few places where the method you suggest was used on a large scale.
Finally, the "shell was worth its weight in gold" thing is probably a myth. It is certainly true that shell was traded for gold, but whether their per-pound values were ever equal has not been established. The misconception likely arose from the Saharan habit of silent bartering, wherein traders would stack up goods on a bartering mat, each adjusting the size of his pile until an agreement was reached. Negotiations could take days, and often the two participants never saw one another. European travelers saw shell-for-gold deals in negotiation, and assumed a parity of value where probably none existed.

Yes it is obviously supply/demand- says basic high school economics.  That's the answer EVERY TIME.  But you're hearing the wrong question.  The question is: what market factors changed the supply and demand?
When the price of btc flucuations and somebody asks why and another responds with supply vs demand; that is the biggest cop out.  If it was 60F one day and 90F the next day and somebody asks why you don't say "because the weather changed and the temp went up" because that answer is dense as fuck.  You say something like "a high pressure system blah blah blah".  The reason is because the question isn't "what happened with the temperature" the question is "what caused the temps to move".

Do you really understand these laws or do you just know that these laws exist? What laws are they specifically, without googling it?  You are basing this on ancedotal testimony from some "big stink" users but you don't know if these guys just forgot their passwords and needed a reset or.  Or if they had under a specific amount of funds and certain AML laws apply or don't apply.  Or they were from certain countries.
You keep saying they are stealing.  Remember when you signed up to mtgox and you agreed to something?  Did you read it?  Probably not.  But you agreed to all these terms that are happening.  That's not stealing.  If you hold up your end of the terms and supply somebody's personal information then your funds are returned.  Mr Mtgox isn't on a yacht on the Carribean with your so called stolen funds, he's on a yacht on the Carribean with the % he takes on the transfers.
You keep coming up with suggestions like you should have a say in their business plan.  "refuse deposts from a TOR node"  "create a refund address" .  I'm pretty sure, highguy420, you are not a lawyer.
You say they gain operational benefit by gaining the money.  You think it's because they steal funds and can pay payroll.  Naive.  What they do gain by enforcing AML is they are preceived by law enforcement as a witness and not an accessory.  As a result they haven't been shut down already or are not under an open investigation at the moment.  They are also allowed to play in with the big boys in the banking system.  Something that is very important and it is what keeps Mtgox above their competitors who don't require as strict AML.
But hey, it's another circle jerk of naive ideas and I'm a bit late.

"... one of the controllers failed"?
What controllers are you referencing?  If you have a software raid you'll probably have a single SATA controller.  With a hardware RAID you'll likely have a single SATA RAID controller.  Why do you have multiple controllers?  If the controllers failed, replace them and cross your fingers.  If a drive failed you're fucked.

The word required.  He made it seem like you are required to withdraw from an atm and pay more atm fees because it fit his (false) narrative.  You just need cash.  Doesn't matter how you get it.  He made it seem that you had to use the ATM and you had to pay some fees, as if the ATM machine was somehow connected to the sending of bitcoins.  You are not required to withdraw money from an ATM. That is false in his statement. I call him out and I get downvoted.  I feel like I'm the only one that actually read what he wrote and UNDERSTOOD what he wrote.  Everybody else was all "Yeah bitcoins thru cvs suxs so i'll upvote you"- the actual definition of a circlejerk.
