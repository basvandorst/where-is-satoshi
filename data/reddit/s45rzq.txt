What's a better place to buy bitcoin that is safer?
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:02:43
No way in hell any of those are safer than Coinbase.  You're smoking crack.

Bottom next crash is at lowest 50k--probably a lot more if they get lightning working seamlessly for the average joe.

This sounds like it sets the stage to increase the block size and still use the same bandwidth.  Is that incorrect?

I have a significant investment in bitcoin.  You're barking up the wrong tree.

Are you kidding?   Nano and ALL POS coins are truly POS.  The fundamental problem with Nano and POS is most exchanges hold a ton and give them far too much sway in the network.  
Hell if you want a reorg in Nano, just bribe the largest exchanges.  Binance itself could probably take down Nano if they wanted.

So you see what I'm talking about.  Nano also has two other problems.  It is essentially just instant DPOS--every single transaction is voted on as soon as it occurs.  This sounds great until you try to run a full node and realize it kills your hard drive and network.  Try it.  I have. I used to hold a lot until I realized the shortcomings.  The other problem is there is little incentive to run a full node. I'm not getting paid, why should I run a full node and those with a lot of nano are just looking to sell so they aren't too keen on it either.  
Nano is an absolute disaster waiting to happen.  There's a reason they can't get it to run on many exchanges.  No one wants the trouble.  Every time there is an issue, the devs just point the blame at the exchanges.  It shouldn't be that hard to verify a double spend isn't occurring.

This is so cringe.  It's not going to take off until it hits 30k.   Min top is at least 100k but likely 400k.  
Bitcoin has always near 20x previous highs.  This is what you see with the introduction of a global asset class/money that's better than  we've ever seen before.

It's going to at least 100k probably 400k in the next year and a half.
