Are you intentionally misleading people about the usefulness lightning network or do you just not comprehend it properly?

I was hoping maybe that I could be refunded in the amount of OMG I was meant to be sent, which would of course compensate the price movement. getting my bitcoin back at least means I have not made a real loss.

It was a precise trade, I opened a ticket an hour or so after seeing the trade had failed, and provided all the information they requested, but here many hours later I have not been told what will happen with my BTC and hence I turned to Reddit, thanks for the responses guys. well RIP my potential earnings haha! &lt;/3 I hope that I get my BTC back though.

The same Ethereum that handles more daily transactions than bitcoin?

It is certainly possible to change the block time of bitcoin to a much shorter amount of time in order to make it act more as a usable currency, but this is not in the interest of bitcoin because it would drastically increase bitcoin's inflation rate, and the low inflation rate (and limited amount of bitcoins that will ever exist) is right now the only thing that puts bitcoin above other crypto currencies like Ethereum which handles more daily transactions, has lower transaction fees and faster transaction times than bitcoin. Likely, thanks to the lightning network, bticoin will be used as a bank in the future, to store your money and avoid the inflation of fiat currency/other cryptos, while currencies like vertcoin will be used by everyday people to make purchases because it is much faster than bitcoin, and Ethereum will be used by businesses in order to save a lot of time and money by implementing smart contracts to handle their operations automatically and trustlessly. Smart contracts will also be quite useful in peer to peer negotiations.

He said he's specifically talking about not using a middlemen, so in that case a shift card doesn't help him. As an answer to the question, I think transaction times are a factor in businesses accepting bitcoin, a transaction, even one included in the very next block, can take nearly 10 minutes for a single confirmation, at a restaurant this isn't a big deal, but at store customers often don't want to be waiting around for 10 minutes just to ensure the transaction has gone through, and businesses probably don't like that transactions may not be confirmed until 10 minutes after a customer has left. Credit cards often take a while for transactions to appear in businesses accounts but because these businesses trust banks its not such a big deal. For a crypto currency to be used as widely as credit cards I imagine it would need an average block time of less than 20 seconds, meaning an average transaction time of around 10 seconds or less.
