Well I promised i'd update my status if anything got resolved and it has....
I deposited 503.95 through MoneyGram-&gt;ZIPZAP-&gt;BitInstant-&gt; MTGox on April 7th, 2013.
It said it was still loading at MtGox.
After Posting here, Reddit, support and anywhere else i could seek help, i got some resolutions. Infact i even posted i would forget about the money i lost in potential profits.
Well soon as i posted on reddit and all that, I had a manual transfer show up for the quote ID.
Half hour later my initial deposit for 480 was sitting all happy in my MTgox account.
I will honor my word and not bug you guys about the 80 bucks i lost in potential profits.
I am going to think long and hard about using your service next time, but i appreciate you honored my deposit.
BITINSTANT WILL FIX IT GUYS!!! BE RELENTLESS THOUGH...took me 2 days of constant badgering to get it done.
