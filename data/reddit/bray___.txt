Thanks for he lengthy reply! See this is where this all gets confusing for me haha, is it easier than it sounds when it comes to all the hardware wallets and what not? Like the seed stuff sounds so complicated, my bit coin is currently just sat in Coinbase

Hi I don’t know if you’ll know the answer but what’s the safest way to buy ripple? Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:34:43
Are they pricey? And where can I pick one up from?

Man you’ve been a massive help I can’t thank you enough!
Is it easy to make copy of the seeds and private pins?  Cause that sounds so confusing haha, would I just write he pins down and keep them in a safe place?
I will make sure to buy a ledger when I next get some money! Thanks again for being so kind enough to explain!

Thanks a lot for the information man!

Can you suggest one for IOS? That’s reliable? I will buy a hardware one when I next have some money as I’ve had car insurance and what not to pay for.

Will it still work if it’s a small amount though?

Do you think ripple is gonna go anywhere?
I want to invest in more than bitcoin but I don’t know which ones are the best.

Hi another question, am I okay leaving my bitcoin in Coinbase for now as it’s literally only a tiny amount? And if I do move it how and where should I?
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:02:39
Does it matter how much I put away? Obviously the more the better but will small bits be okay?
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:51:49
That is very true, stupid thing to say really.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:42:17
Okay thanks so much for the advice, I will continue to put small bits away and hopefully one day I can make it into something a decent size, I will definitely look into the YouTuber you recommended!

Not enough unfortunately, will take donations though ��
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:30:57
That makes a lot of sense when you say it that way, thank you sir.
I’ll have a look at the ones you named and maybe put a little into each one, only trouble is I’m a newbie and only have Coinbase right now and none of those are on there.
What other do you recommend other than Coinbase? Preferably something that has a IOS app, thanks!
