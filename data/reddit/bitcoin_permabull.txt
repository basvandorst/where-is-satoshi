Bitfinex use (or used) US Dollars which means they need access to the US banking system. Even outside of the USA, this is still true. That's what was at risk with BNP Paribas - their ability to transact in US Dollars.

The US regulatory regime / authority does extend to sovereign territories outside the USA. Just ask BNP Paribas.

Incorrect. It's still capital gains even if you hold it for a few minutes or hours, it's just that you pay a lower rate if it's "long term capital gains" which is the 1 year period you were thinking of.

Bitcoin is now 10% of global aggregate fiat?
Wow when did the bitcoin price go to $300k per coin, last time I checked it was still in the measly 3 figure range (or ~0.01% of global aggregate fiat).
@_date: 2016-04-21 11:30:39
Is anyone surprised by this?
@_date: 2016-08-24 13:06:49
Ahhh thanks for the clarification. In that case, yes I think it's likely that bitcoin's value at that point would likely be 10% of M0 and potentially single digit percentages of M3. It will likely take banks years to actually understand this stuff to the point that they're at step 3.

Bitcoin being used for the majority of illegal drug purchases. This is probably the most short term win and mainstream use case for bitcoin. More than 50% of Americans have smoked weed and when you extend out to all illegal drugs, it's a pretty "mainstream" thing to do. It's bitcoin's "killer app" right now, even though people don't like to talk about it. If bitcoin becomes easier to buy and the local liquidity sources improve, it'll continue to grow as a % of the drug trade. If it were the majority of the drug trade, the price would probably be $10k+ without any speculators.

Yeah I hope they add HD too! Core's definitely more focussed on the network and protocol than the wallet, which I am 100% on board with that prioritisation. I don't really mind the public seed + private key issue because I wouldn't give out my public seed to anyone anyway and I also wouldn't give out a private key to anyone either. If anyone is running (a future, HD version of) core with a public seed on a server for instance, they should just make sure to keep the private keys offline or on another device.

My view is that by giving their customers access to BCH, they allow their customers to move forward with the rest of the ecosystem. A system (segwit) that requires many many exchanges, users, etc to upgrade in order to have a meaningful impact on the fees everyone pays - is unlikely to succeed. Not sure why anyone would use BTC when transactions are currently faster/cheaper on BCH and in futures, LN transactions will be cheaper and easier on BCH as well.
I'll probably be censored or banned for having this opinion, but that's the risk I take I suppose.

Sorry to hear that, but I am curious about Uber's service. Are you in India?
@_date: 2016-04-30 15:16:44


Oh interesting. I haven't actually heard of any advantages to non HD wallets, what are they? Is it that if you have the private key of one address and the public seed, you can find the private keys of all other addresses, or something else?

Uber does not accept cash, so I don't know how you plan to do this. Unless by "pay cash" you mean "pay with a prepaid debit card" which is arguably not the same thing.

Maybe they're supporting small blocks on BTC and big blocks on BCH. Maybe they are aligning with the principles of each.

This doesn't make any sense. Blockchain.info doesn't hold customer funds, so they don't pay transaction fees themselves. They aren't losing any money at all from transaction fees. Bitcoin cash made sense to implement first, because it enabled Blockchain.info users to have access to their BCH, if for example - they wanted to sell/dump them, or spend them.
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:24:04
Makes more sense to accept an altcoin than to accept BTC when the BTC transaction fees are $30-100 per transaction. Accept the altcoin, convert to USD to pay expenses.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:36:14
Current average fees: 
Why are you laughing? Are you somehow paying less? I pay over $100 to get BTC out of BitMEX. Plenty of places are even higher. Wallet software often defaults to well over $30, sometimes well over $150.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:12:02
If we want to apply this standard to bitcoin, then BTC and BCH should both be included, as they have both been forked from the original code Satoshi released, which did not have a block size limit. Satoshi then forked bitcoin, creating a "scam" by Charlie's definition, to add a block size limit. Please ignore BTC and BCH and all other forks deriving from these, as they are scams.
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:40:46
How is it the case that BCH can't be traced back to the genesis block?? They both trace back to the genesis block, what're you talking about?

There's definitely a chance, but it's very low. Bitcoin has network effects in liquidity, mining power, users, merchant acceptance, financial institutions using/building on it, etc that are extremely strong - whereas other cryptocurrencies are no where near that level. They all face significant hurdles and so chances are that bitcoin will continue winning.

OK....so either:
- the bitcoinfees site is constantly incorrect
- there is a constant spam attack going on

Which one is it?
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:49:56
Could you explain this? I have paid as much as 150 satoshi/byte and it's not been enough for the next block. I regularly check  and adjust my fee when my wallet isn't spending a high enough fee. What do you mean by your statement, I'm confused.

@_date: 2017-03-17 09:50:19
Let's say this maturity requirement softfork went through. Miners could easily solve this problem by hedging out their exposure in a physically delivered futures market. Now that market doesn't exist today, but if it did in the future (ha ha, pun intended) it would be a solution to this "problem" for them. You can't force a miner to be invested in bitcoin in the long term - or even in the short term.
@_date: 2017-03-31 23:05:22
I'm going to report this post because it's about an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:21:16
They could mine the coins to a multisig 2-of-3 contract between:
- Miner
- Exchange
- The "buy" side
Then the idea wouldn't work, because they would have zero long term investment/exposure to bitcoin. FYI miners might already be doing this with forward contracts, no physically delivered futures exchange required.
@_date: 2016-06-16 21:18:54
Ahhh. Thanks for the explanation, really useful. Cheers. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 10:13:24
I don't understand how the miners are all short. Wouldn't they be long, since their future income is in BTC. If they were selling/writing futures contracts, they could potentially hedge that "long" position and even become short, but AFAIK the natural state of any un-hedged miner is to be long BTC.
How is this incorrect?

He's massively wrong on this. According to [Tax Justice Network]( the amount in offshore tax havens is $32 Trillion. 
1% * 32 Trillion = $320 Billion
$320 Billion / 21 Million total BTC = $15k per BTC
Still a great bitcoin price, but Trace Mayer's math is entirely wrong here.
@_date: 2016-06-23 10:06:46
Feel free to explain to me how I am wrong.
If you're referring to the fact that FOMO may ensue and other monies as well may also move into BTC, that's a separate point - **but** that's absolutely not what Trace Mayer was saying. In fact he even clarified to say something along the lines of "this is before you even count FOMO, etc". 
@_date: 2016-06-16 14:00:55
Which exchange was this on?
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:53:56
Yes they do and you will need people coming into those futures markets and delivering bitcoin. Bakkt aren't going to source the bitcoin themselves.
@_date: 2016-06-10 09:34:08
You are correct. He's referring to electronic US dollars.
@_date: 2016-06-23 10:40:43
Did anyone say anything about sending $320B to bitcoin exchanges and buying bitcoin on orderbooks? That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about $320B moving into bitcoin in whatever way is most efficient, like going to OTC desks at exchanges, etc. It would take a while, a period of years, and at the end it might also trigger FOMO and hodl'ers holding out, in which case - yes the price would be much higher. 
However my original point remains true, if $320B was in BTC, then the price would be $15k. Trace is saying $3M. There's no defensible math for $3M and there **is** very defensible math backing the $15k figure. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 08:03:47
0.5% would be $7600 per BTC. Please see my other comment in this thread. Still a great bitcoin price! But not $1.5M.

This is like asking: Where is Coinbase Pro, Bitstamp or Bitfinex going to source the bitcoins for their BTC/USD markets. They don't! Their users do! Same goes for BAKKT, who are an exchange, and create a marketplace. It's up to users to come in and deposit BTC and sell them.

No - they won't have to do **any** prefunding. They are probably not going to allow themselves to make markets and trade, on their own exchange. I.e. they can't sell bitcoin futures there, so no prefunding.

No, we shouldn't be moving towards decentralized exchanges like BitSquare. They have no liquidity, no measures of preventing fraud (if you are a market maker) and are way too clunky to use. BitSquare.io is a terrible idea for anyone, especially a newcomer, to be using to buy or sell bitcoin. If you're going to recommend a decentralised solution, go with LocalBitcoins, not BitSquare.

The internet. Torrent networks. Tor. Linux (this might be debatable). Price discovery of any asset is also decentralised. Bond trading, Swaps trading much of derivatives trading is decentralised in that most trading happens off exchanges (OTC). The success of the Rothschild family can very much be attributed to their early embrace of decentralisation, Mayer sent his sons to different European capitals, thus spreading out wealth and information gathering. Berkshire Hathaway, one of the most successful capitalist organisations of all time also embraced the "leaderless" [concept of decentralisation](
Bitcoin's security and stability comes from it's decentralisation.

Financial privacy is **really** important to some people. However different people place different levels of importance on it. This user is not asking about privacy or complaining about account seizure. Take note:


This user seems to be looking for the lowest cost way to acquire bitcoin, rather than a privacy oriented way to acquire bitcoin. Also in the case of Bitsquare.io, which you "strongly recommend", there are **less than half a bitcoin available to purchase.** For any serious (or even casual) bitcoin buyer, this should not be a site to recommend. They have pretty much zero liquidity.
If you're trying to focus on privacy, recommend LocalBitcoins (where there is actual liquidity) and mention in the comments that your recommendation is a privacy oriented recommendation, rather than one based on price (which is what the user is actually requesting).
@_date: 2016-09-26 10:58:50
Almost all of these options will have higher total fees (fee + spread) than Coinbase and many will have arguably higher risk as well. You list Bitsquare.io, but if you take a look at their orderbook, there are 3 sell orders at prices in the $630+ range. Also you have to trust random strangers and escrow providers, etc - rather than trusting a single established company. This user should be using something like Circle or Coinbase's GDAX exchange rather than what you're suggesting. The only thing you suggested that might be better is Kraken, but even they have worse liquidity in USD vs Coinbase. This person is better off just sticking to Coinbase or Circle.

Hash rate is the only method bitcoin inherently has to vote on consensus rules. It can't be gamed or sybil attacked, it's purely economics. Bitcoin isn't about democracy, it's about Proof of Work, meaning that the people who put in work (through mining) get to decide which transactions are valid and what constitutes a valid block (consensus). Investors then can choose to buy bitcoin or not based on whether they like the rules that miners are enforcing.
Twitter polls are dumb.
@_date: 2017-10-05 07:24:02
Completely agree with you brother.
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:38:01
"All polls rigged" OK but seriously, what % of the bitcoin community and bitcoin users will respond to a poll put out by Tuur Demeester or Adam Back? I think we'd be lucky to think that 0.05% of the community/users/investors would even *see* much less respond to one of those polls.
Since when is bitcoin about democracy through twitter polls!?! If you want a democratic election, go use USD. I want a sovereign currency where 1 CPU = 1 vote and the rules are determined by capitalists (investors and miners) not by stupid twitter polls.
All of these "we're under attack" type panic posts are just so fearful about something which is supposed to be anti-fragile and resistant to all types of attack (internal, government, banking, etc). So what if 2X is an attack! May the best fork win!

Incredibly misleading diagram. Not free, not instant and also since things are migrating over to the lightning network it's not directly peer-to-peer anymore, it's going through a number of intermediaries which you need to trust to be always online, or your payment reverses back to you. BTC is a store of value which can't be inflated, it's not able to compete with things like visa, mastercard, paypal, venmo and western union. Fees can be as much as $100 in BTC to make a $5 payment, so there's no point in advertising it against something like Western Union, which is consistent in it's fees and in BTC volume spikes, consistently cheaper.

You do know the original bitcoin blockchain had no block size limits right?

People who advocate for Bitcoin Cash are not any scammier than people who advocate for Bitcoin. Both coins are the oldest coin, invented in 2009 and have a legitimate claim to the "Bitcoin" name. Anyway, the bitcoin software is open source so nothing to stop forks from happening. Bitcoin cash was the ultimate resolution to the block size debate, where big blockers can go to BCH and small blockers can use BTC and work on LN. Everyone wins. No need to call BCH advocates scammers.

Sure but we already have LocalBitcoins for this. Or Paxful even. They already have decent spreads and you can exchange ID/KYC documents with your seller outside of the LocalBitcoins platform. Why would you need BitSquare?
If BitSquare are able to get to the point where the quality of the experience overall is good enough for what the OP is asking about, then people should recommend them. Right now that's not the case and there are much, much better alternatives. LocalBitcoins and Paxful both have escrow and a reputation system. No need for BitSquare which hasn't developed and matured the level of features that are required for something like this.

I don't think he's getting anyone confused. Bitcoin needs larger blocks and is holding people back by keeping the block size at 1MB. This subreddit has been censoring people like crazy and preventing anyone from questioning the mantra of small blocks. There's nothing wrong with a large block size and letting the orphan risk prevent the blocks from getting out of control.
I'm glad Roger is doing the work he's doing, we need more people like him promoting bitcoin and advocating for the version of bitcoin with large blocks.
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:41:04
He's speaking the truth. He has been since 2011. Don't silence the truth, censorship is bad.

Please stop giving people this advice. Look at the ["order book"]( on their site and you will see 1.2 BTC available **in total** to buy. The spread is literally $90 between the bid and ask. If BitSquare are ever able to attract professional sellers, those sellers will ask for ID of some sort in order to protect themselves from fraud, since bank transfers can be reversed. This is no better than Circle or Coinbase and in many ways (especially price) is much, much worse.

Interesting. Great point. I wonder if this would cost more than settling and delivering Gold on a gold vehicle or asset manager. My thinking is that at scale, esp if you only need to deliver it to a small number of high value institutions, it's probably cheaper with BTC vs with Gold.
@_date: 2016-10-07 13:03:36
Dude. In 2013 bitcoin did 100x. What is your problem?

Welcome to reddit What does the bitcoin foundation actually have to do with the issuance of bitcoin? Hint: Nothing!!
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:07:47
I disagree, doesn't it have everything to do with this situation? The OP is saying "should have used bitcoin" but bitcoin's fees can be as high as $100 per transaction. At best the OP should say "should have used bitcoin when the network is not very popular for transacting in" because it's not necessarily a great idea to send $65 using bitcoin. In fact it can be a terrible idea.
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:05:48
More settlement transactions = more fees
@_date: 2016-10-11 21:31:29
LocalBitcoins isn't a tool for day traders either. Mate, come back when BitSquare has more than $1000 bitcoin *in total* available to buy or sell. Maybe people will listen to your cries of "just use bitsquare" then.
@_date: 2016-10-26 10:17:05
Jeez man. If they're charging less than 5% in NYC, they're probably losing money when you factor in the risk.

I'm still confused. What funding?
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:02:33
In December, bitcoin would have been much worse than this. If transactions increase, then bitcoin could once again be $50 fees.
@_date: 2016-10-30 17:58:51
The bitcoin foundation is now completely irrelevant, so get over yourself. They've been completely replaced with better ways to fund developers. Relax.
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:45:20
Yeah just use PayPal and send it off chain. Wiring money is like an on chain transaction where you write directly to the bank's block chain - that's something that should only be done for high value and corporate transactions. Anything smaller should use third parties and trusted networks - in this case PayPal.
Similar model to BTC in many ways.
@_date: 2016-10-23 19:49:07
Really? Fascinating, I was not expecting that. Do you have any source or charts? It's not that I don't believe you, I'm just interested in the data.

You're wrong here. It seems like it's extremely difficult to design, print and produce mining chips...otherwise loads of companies would be undercutting Jihan.

OK...so we're only up 50x? That's an incredible return, what on earth is your problem? If you're in this for short term speculation, you should go elsewhere. Bitcoin is a long term investment.

They never traded GBP&lt;-&gt;BTC and were not based in London, but Slovenia. They had a post office company based in Reading and currently a London address, but have never been based anywhere other than Slovenia.
@_date: 2016-10-11 14:19:31
Makes sense. There's less liquidity in BTC relative to Yuan, so a 0.3% move could easily produce a 3% move in BTC.

Good idea. Which white hat / hacktivist organisations could be contacted to do this?

@_date: 2016-05-25 11:16:04
Except that he didn't. He released the white paper months before releasing the code. Then he released the code and started mining and securing the network. Very different situation vs ETH...
@_date: 2016-10-31 11:52:07


LOL. What?
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:58:48
Correct, but that's only because there's very few bitcoin transactions happening now. If we returned to many people using bitcoin, then fees could go back to $50 or $100 or something.

I didn't say that ETH does not have smart multisig contracts. I'm saying that was incorrect about his statement that bitcoin does **not** have smart contracts currently. Bitcoin does have smart multisig contracts currently. 


Higher in what way? Bitcoin's market cap is higher, it has more real world users, more projects using it, more startups building on top of it, more dark net market businesses accepting it (virtually none or actually none accept ETH) and more smart contracts on it. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 18:44:50


Bitcoin **does** have smart contracts, it just doesn't have "turing complete" smart contracts like Ethereum. The only smart contracts in bitcoin are the smart contracts that have a real world, real money usage today - multisignature smart contracts. Multisig is used in the real world, by big bitcoin companies like Coinbase, Xapo, Coinfloor, etc. It's also being proposed to be used in oracle situations like Veritaseum or escrow situations in projects like OpenBazaar. 
No one cares about ETH. The DAO will either lose all the money or have all the money redeemed. ETH will die and if any of the smart contracts prove useful, they will be added to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:43:54
Ahhh LOL thanks for clarifying! I'm not very familiar with American sports teams. Cheers.
@_date: 2016-05-26 20:20:47
Try using Coinfloor? Last time I wired them £5k, it cleared in a matter of hours not days. They also have a p2p offering similar to LocalBitcoins, but with typically better prices. For large amounts though, I consider it worth my bank's fee and there's no FX spread involved, since it's going to a GBP account. 
UK banks suck, they hate bitcoin, I know a lot of the guys in the London/startup bitcoin scene and they all say the same thing...hopefully this situation improves, but it seems like the banks have an oligopoly and are hellbent on quietly stifling innovation.

BTC is much easier to physically deliver or settle compared to Gold. The appetite for this type of product may be small.
@_date: 2017-05-29 12:34:40
Welcome to reddit Your comment sounds remarkably scripted...
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:54:12


I've been thinking about this too. The only thing I can think of is as a way of plausible deniability in case he is arrested for creating bitcoin. However, at this point he has admitted it publicly and presented some compelling evidence, so I don't think there really is much deniability. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:13:50
Same thing?

Ahhh ok yes agreed. Thanks for the explanation. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 08:28:00
This guy owns over 100,000 BTC. Do you really think he'd botch the setup of a multisig wallet?

That doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2016-10-07 13:05:13
Yeah by his method, the market cap of USD is infinity as well. This method of calculating market cap does not work well for assets without a guaranteed forever fixed supply (which are most assets).

Fifth option - they let themselves get replay attacked and a few people take all their client's BCC.
@_date: 2015-10-18 22:54:17
This should arguably get more credit than it's getting today. Even if Facebook became an off-chain transaction processor and used bitcoin that way, the number of people depositing and withdrawing bitcoin would = more than 7 transactions per second, at any meaningful level of adoption. We need scalability and we need it fast. However, we also need to do it right. I support BIP100.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:31:08
Bitcoin Cash might? Otherwise, probably not.

@_date: 2016-07-27 15:30:36
The fee would be $0, since it's an off chain transaction. I don't see why people are complaining about bitcoin's fees when it's the only decentralised monetary+payments system. For some things, PayPal or Venmo or other methods will always be cheaper - but is low fees the reason you're in bitcoin? I'm here for the censorship resistance, decentralisation and limited supply. If you don't want to use bitcoin until the fees are lower, then wait on the lightning network or use off chain transactions (like changetip).
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:31:46
Yes it should be obvious that anyone looking to send a micropayment does not need the strength of the entire bitcoin network standing behind their tiny payment immediately right when the payment was made.
@_date: 2016-07-27 16:33:16
As I said, you're looking to use bitcoin proper in this situation for purely ideological reasons rather than any concern over the actual fee or counterparty risk involved.
@_date: 2017-07-14 10:01:29


Incorrect, there's also been improvements in the hardware of computers that contribute significantly.

100%. Also not nearly as decentralised as bitcoin is and is planning to migrate to proof of stake, which has never worked in the long term.

Why do you want to use bitcoin proper for a sub $5 or $10 tip though? Changetip are not a fly-by-night off chain solution, they're owned by Airbnb, a $10BN+ company and have been functioning well for years. I would hazard a guess that you're looking to use bitcoin proper in this situation for purely ideological reasons, rather than any complaint about the fees charged or the safety/security of your funds. Yes if you store funds with Changetip, you have counterparty risk to them - but you're only going to be storing $5 or $10 or some small amount.
