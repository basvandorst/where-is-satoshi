I would absolutely LOVE to hear a coherent argument about how bankers are threatened by crypto.  You guys seem to love spitting out libertarian talking point after talking point, but none of you can back up your assertions.  None of you show any hard examples why banks care about crypto, and none of you state reasons why they would.  Yet this same lame talking point gets recycled day after day with no substance behind it.
Eagerly awaiting your response,
-A banker

He was the one who just got put away for money laundering for Silk Road.  Anyways, he is very obviously retarded, look at this gem of a quote:


@_date: 2015-01-18 01:31:07


No we wouldn't.  We're quickly finding out that nobody (except libertarians) cares about a decentralized financial network.  Nobody else gives two fucks who controls their money.  However, libertarians have tricked themselves into thinking that everyone indeed thinks with the same line of "thinking" they do.  However, as evidenced by bitcoins complete and total lack of user adoption in the last 6 years (&lt; 1 million people), that idea is just patently false.
So maybe instead of focusing on lying (instant transactions, free transactions) and pumping the decentralized aspect (which nobody cares about), you should start advertising the advantages bitcoin has over traditional networks in place (hint there's none) and why the average joe should buy bitcoin (hint there's none).  
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:07:57
Or you might look at the platforms changetip is currently available on: reddit, youtube, and twitter.  Then you would see that these major platforms didn't change adoption in the slightest.  And then from that you can conclude that this won't change anything!

So it's never happened to an alt coin before that used bitcoins exact difficulty adjustment code?   Hint: it has.

I don't think you understand how hilarious this sub truly is.  To normal people, we look at this place and see you as the equivalent of a flat earther.  We quite literally place you on the same level of crazy as someone who thinks the earth is flat.  Let that sink in for a moment.  The complete and total delusional sentiment from libertarians and ancaps is enough to power the wasteful network that is bitcoin.

Actually bitcoin in its current state can't handle [more than 3 transactions per second](  The more you know (the more you laugh at it)!

Wow kind of like how the price dropped to $275 in October and immediately rose to $320 and then over the next week to $417.  I believe everyone said exactly what you are saying now then to.  They said that multiple times this year in fact, at just about every major price point.  And yet here we are!

Lol let me be the first to say that everyone in this subreddit are those suckers that are buying the penny stock that's being pumped and dumped by the wolves.  The difference is you guys are also the ones promoting the penny stock, while the wolves (early adopters) just sit back and cash out.  You're doing all the heavy lifting, and losing all the money.  Huzzah!

That's not a fair question, it's not about how many real people have used it (which despite taking up 75% of the real-estate on the invoice is actually 0%) it's about how many dedicated soldiers of this subreddit will buy shit off of him via this ~~advertisement~~ thread.
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:03:59
That's actually not true.  A single individual has been spamming fake transactions to the block chain - 10s of thousands a day - for years.
He's solely responsible for 25-50% of all bitcoin "transactions".  So yes, it costs him a lot, but his goal of making the bitcoin network look used by real people is being accomplished.
@_date: 2015-01-19 05:57:56
It's not an appeal to authority.  It's not saying hey look at this celebrity thinks bitcoin is going to crash, therefor it's going to crash.  It's saying hey look MIT, a school specifically known for their research in TECHNOLOGY, a school where students have openly posted open source bitcoin software, and finally, a school which literally handed out $100 of bitcoin to every student on campus .....they hink something might be wrong with bitcoin.  But I guess none of that means anything to you right?  
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:30:18
Would have saved you with Ryan Kennedy (Mint Pal) as well.  It would be interesting to load that thread on bitcointalk that tracked 48 scams/hacks and see how many of the owners can be traced be to previous scams.  I bet it's a significant number.
@_date: 2015-01-17 14:10:47
Think about this.  Right now bitcoin has the worst wealth inequality of any currency.  It doesn't even compare to the U.S 1% issue, it's far worse.  Now imagine how many bitcoiners there are right now at present: 100,000 with ~13 million coins minded.  So if bitcoin were to actually succeed, these 100,000 people would own over half of the monetary supply in the economy.  It's a complete disaster.
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:23:01
And now will begin the great bubble of 2015: bitcoiners will have people defriending them on a scale never seen before.
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:53:05


You warned them because the system reeked of a ponzi scheme.  And you thought it was a ponzi scheme.  You weren't warning them about a bubble, you were warning them about bitcoin as a whole because it's a shady system.
Nice spin though.  A self proclaimed genius is investing in a self proclaimed ponzi scheme.  Holy fucking irony!

I would tell you but Andreas didn't answer any real questions in the AMA, he just pandered to this sub. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:55:25


You can't.  However, if you subtract the November 2013 bubble from the picture, bitcoin's next highest price point was from the April 2013 bubble which was $266.  Since the following years the price was artificially increased, it should have never passed $266.
If the analysis of the Willy report is correctly assuming that the April 2013 bubble was also artificial, we can conclude that the price of bitcoin should have never been higher than the 2011 bubble which I believe was $32.
Regardless, the market still has some correcting to do and if it ended the year above $100 I would honestly be surprised.  Stranger things have happened though, and there's still a boat load of shady exchanges performing tons of shady dealings, so who knows!  Maybe Willy Bot 2.0 is already in the making and some bucket shop like OKCoin is ready to pump the price again.

How can you possibly compare a protocol ON THE INTERNET to the internet itself.  It makes absolutely no sense what so ever.  One requires hardware and physical infrastructure, the other requires software.  How about compare it to another protocol on the internet, instead of being dishonest and comparing it to the internet.

That's simply not true what so ever.  The reason it's so hard to buy is they don't accept credit cards for bitcoin.  The reason they don't accept credit cards for bitcoin is because criminals are attracted to bitcoin like flies on shit.
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:56:29
That's because the entire industry is unregulated and you're dealing with anonymous "money" over the internet.  Bitcoin is a scammers absolute best case scenario.  Combine that with gullible teenage libertarians and it's like stealing candy from a baby.

@_date: 2015-01-18 16:25:17
Considering this is the longest bear trend in bitcoin history by far, and there's a steady supply of failing bitcoin businesses, only an ostrich with their head in the sand would think everything is peaches and cream.  This time it very well may be different, but admitting that means admitting you might be in for a hell of a hit to your wallet.
Fact is after 6 years of speculating how great bitcoin is, no great developments have come to light.  As that speculation fades, so too does the price.  Since the entire bitcoin economy can be supported by a tiny sliver a fraction of what the price is today, the price will continue to slide until something changes or we hit that price.
@_date: 2015-01-18 02:44:17
Bitcoin died with Gox.  Nobody wants to be associated with a currency that is only known for hacks and scams.  The last year has just been a failed attempt at CPR.
Each time the price was pumped this year, people said this was the next bubble.  And every subsequent pump has been far weaker than the last pump before it.  This last pump from $160s to $230 was the weakest yet at only $70.  Prior pumps had way more FOMO and climbed way higher than $70.  Beginning of 2014 the pumps were over $300, May was high $200s, October was high $100s, and now we have the latest pump at $70.  Sensing a pattern yet?  It's going to continue like this, dropping and then pumping, slowly following the path of alt coins before it.   
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:29:03
It is responsible for the recovery after the April 2013 bubble and the rise to $1000+.  The price of bitcoin should have never made it past $266, but someone created a bot to pump the price.  The report also speculates the April 2013 bubble was also just manipulation as well.
TLDR: Absolute best case scenario bitcoin is worth $100, worst case &lt; $30.

Because bitcoiners can't accept that the price has been steadily declining for well over a year so they create misleading graphs to pump the price out of sheer desperation.  It's a nice little mixture of sadness and desperation for my breakfast today.

Another reasonable person might ask if changetip is 'going viral' why they need to code bots that spam thousands of changetips across all major subreddits.
Another reasonable question to ask is if changetip is viral, why does Google not have enough data over the last 30 days to even do a lookup on Google Trends,
But alas, this is bitcoin and there are no reasonable people here.
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:35:42


I have asked how it did that.  And I concluded that Willy Bot is responsible for the recovery and the current price we're at now.  I look forward to the inevitable further popping of the Willy Bot bubble, all the way to double digits.
