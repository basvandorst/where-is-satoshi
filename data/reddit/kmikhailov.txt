Thanks for reminding me

True. However, we're sitting on a community of over 122,000 bitcoin enthusiasts already. There's no better place to start a network than reddit, especially when it comes to bitcoin.

Yeah, but they're not legit enough for the average person to use them. If you look at Crypothrift, a third of the products are video games, a third are gift cards, and a third is crap. Its not really people selling their belongings. It has to have a name that's identifiable to the average person as well.

People wont just start listing products overnight. It will take time to build a strong community. Especially with the help of the passionate people of Reddit, it can be done. As to your second point, there has been talks of ebay incorporating Bitcoin for quite some time. However, at this point in time, it does not look like they will anytime soon. If anything, I could see this as a merging tool for them.

The thing is that they don't really need to. The bitcoin community is not quite strong enough yet for them to justify implementing it. The only reason for them to do so it out of support for bitcoin. The CEO has said he likes bitcoin, but I just don't see them doing it anytime soon without good reason.

I think you should definitely give credit where credit is due for Facebook. But one is a social network and one is a currency. I feel like they're still trying to ride the Facebook fiasco train with the Winklevii.

I was thinking about this too. They should have a qr scanner attached to your shopping cart that keeps a log of everything in the cart. You can pay for things immediately thus taking away cashier lines.
