The government is a shitface when it comes to the *type* of rules and guidance, but when it does, it always make sure it is airtight. That's the only advantage of bureacracy; consistency.


Nah, its pretty strong. Our refusal to accept that interpretation is meaningless.


I should have precised it's actually US law that FINCEN is interpolating.


Not true, it has to meet all three requirements and even if it is considered legal tender in Zimbabwe (unlikely), it would still not break the 3 requirements as this has not occurred : [iii] is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the **country of issuance**
Bitcoin is not and can not be issued by any country. (Isn't that why we love it?)

I don't propose anything. I am useless in these matters and don't enjoy masturbatory speculations on changing the world. I just posted an article on reddit because I thought it was funny and satirical. And i replied to your quote because I find it offensive for anyone to say that the government I voted to getting is &lt;property&gt; of a private party.
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:03:56
I have to give you A+ for effort but like many bitcoin redditors that purport to be armchair lawyers because "I can read the alphabets yo. Fuck the Gov.", I have to give you an F. 
FINCEN clearly delineates the terms "currency" and virtual currency quite distinctly in [FIN-2013-001]( by stating that virtual currency, the convertible kind, aka bitcoin, is one that is *"either has an equivalent value in real currency, or acts as a substitute for real currency."* 
Preceeding those distinctions, it mentions what is considered currency as such: *"FinCEN's regulations define currency (also referred to as "real" currency) as "the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that [i] is designated as legal tender and that [ii] circulates and [iii] is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance."3"*
Therefore, bitcoin is not a currency and, therefore, not in conflict with the IRS Guidance. Rather bitcoin is a value that substitutes for real currency.
With regards to money transmission, in the same guidance, FINCEN defines money transmission as :*" The term "money transmission services" means "the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means."11*
Since bitcoin as been ruled out as not being a currency and in the same token funds, it is therefore, constituted as a *value that substitutes for currency"*.
Therefore, FINCEN guidance is not in conflict with IRS Guidance.
IRS in their [Guidance]( mention the following to set the tone about virtual currency as such: *"virtual currency operates like “real” currency -- i.e., the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender, circulates, and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance -- but it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction."*
The trait of bitcoin of not being a currency is stated by IRS, and also congruent with FINCEN's statement. Therefore, FINCEN guidance is not in conflict with IRS guidance.
owned you foo.
P.S: Do you think that IRS since stemming from Treasury and FINCEN stemming from Treasury as well would not have made sure that they do not conflict before releasing this guidance ? IRS is releasing this guidance because every money laundering infraction(FINCEN) is generally accompanied by its relevant tax evasion(IRS) charges, and that has been true for Currency. So they wanted to make sure that everyone knew that the same correlation exists with respect to virtual currency.
Edit: One would need a Money Transmitter License statewide, but Federally it is a Money Services Business *registration*, they are not the same. Do most FINCEN registered MSBs also have state Money Transmitter **Licenses**. Sure. But some don't...

You're assuming that the criminal justice system moves at the speed of thought. Evidence gathering takes time. On taxation even more. You are living in a world that I am not sure exists. Whether you have seen it or not really doesn't matter and is uttlery useless. The fact is that it happens. It's the last straw gov beats you with when money laundering charges or other criminal charges can't stick.


I don't know what you meant, but I am assuming you are trying to say that you never saw a drug dealer get charged with tax evasion as well. Again, whether you saw it happen is pretty pointless to the fact that it is there and it is always used when all else fails. In fact, there is a very early and charismatic character that was pinned on tax evasion when criminal charges couldn't stick. Some would describe him as the quintessential criminal... Ring a bell ;) ?

@_date: 2014-04-04 05:23:35
I have worked in few banks and have seen these letters sent out regarding credit card closures due to high risk, and it is because the users committed too many chargebacks, to the point where the bank was just fed up and realized the merchants were getting fucked by this customer. So they said screw it, dump this customer,  because the reversals from interchange and admin work was cutting into the margin per account.
But I am sure that is not the case here.
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:12:39
