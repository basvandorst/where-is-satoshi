I actually have had a half-baked, crazy idea in my head lately.  The problem with news is how to decide what is fake and what is real.  The idea (again, half baked), is to use something like a blockchain to decide what news is real.  So consensus would decide the "longest chain" of news, meaning that most people agree that it is real.  That's about as far as I am with the idea.  But I figured I'd post it, maybe it gets trashed, maybe someone else has had a similar idea.

I totally agree about the "spending bitcoins" experience - it's possible, but very sloppy.  There needs to be a product for local, in-person businesses (think restaurants, bars) that makes it easy to accept bitcoins, allows for tipping, etc.  The QR code should have the price already in it, so the customer doesn't have to enter the price manually, or convert from euros, etc.  Do any existing products (like Coinbase, Bitpay, etc) handle this?  If not, it's an opportunity.

Tipping is a big problem with local businesses taking bitcoin payments.  When I paid at Room77 in Berlin, one of the employees was saying the servers don't like taking bitcoin because people forget to tip, and the bitcoin payment system isn't set up to allow adding a tip.  Basically you have to tip in cash, which kind of defeats one of the purposes of using bitcoin (to avoid fiat currency).
Coinbase, if you are working on a product for local businesses to accept bitcoin, be sure to consider this.  If possible, eat your own dog food by being a customer in a local business that accepts bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-21 06:46:55

Wait, if you're re-downloading the blockchain, it makes sense that your balance would show as 0.0 until it gets far enough along in the blockchain to see the transactions that added money to your wallet.  Make sense?
Wait for blockchain to download, and see if you have balance then.

Couldn't we take advantage of Bitcoin's conditional transactions (I forget the correct name of them).  Where you say "I will pay x BTC to this address when event X happens".  The common example is "when I die, pay X btc to my child".  This requires an "oracle" (a trusted one, presumably) who can determine when the event has happened.  Then Wikipedia could see, on the blockchain, how many btc are waiting for them.  Once they accept bitcoin and the oracle confirms it, I think they could get access to the bitcoins.   
Am I understanding this correctly?

Apple allows PayPal, which allows sending payments from your PayPal account ("wallet").  Yet Apple doesn't allow Bitcoin.  There is an inconsistency here.  Eventually, I predict it will be resolved.  And as always, I could be totally wrong.

Is it a BIP-0038 wallet?  Does the private address begin with "6"?  If so, you use bitaddress.org to decrypt that address into a "5" private key, and import that "5" key into bitcoin-qt.

Business Insider's goal is to make you click on links to their articles.  They do this with provocative titles.  I'm not sure why so many people don't realize this.  If no one clicked on links to their articles, they would go out of business.  Act accordingly.

I'd be more concerned with the printed wallet lasting years, surviving moisture, humidity, and the elements.  I tested a paper wallet printed with an Inkjet... it smeared way too easily.  Definitely want some good paper and a laser printer, or maybe something laminated (But then, I can't trust Kinko's to laminate it!)

Here's an idea:  Write a Gmail add-on (maybe this is done with a Chrome app?).  It lets you send bitcoin the same way Google is sending money with their new feature.  It makes it that simple.

Wouldn't it be cool to be able to send btc via Gmail as easily as attaching a file?

What would be cool is if this were a Passbook app.  When you walk into or near a place that accepts Bitcoin, it shows up on your homescreen.  Bonus, swiping it in passbook brings up Blockchain wallet to pay!
Edit: Of course, once Bitcoin is accepted almost everywhere, the passbook feature would become useless.

Another way to view it is knowledge or information.  Anyone who knows your private key has the necessary information to "spend" (transfer) the bitcoins to a different public key (which in turn is paired with a private key).

Good points.   Here are my thoughts:
A) Dependent on company - yes.  I think people have to trust the company.  Either a big name comes along and provide a secure wallet (Google, etc), whom people already trust, or new companies build trust over time.  Who knows, maybe some forward-thinking bank will step up (but I doubt it).  
B) Vulnerable - Again, a company will have to earn trust by proving it is secure, and possibly even insuring against theft (a long shot). 
C) Only accessible with Internet access - Currently, to spend coins, you need Internet access anyway.  But I make a distinction between a "spending" wallet, with maybe a hundred bucks in it, and your "savings" wallet, with thousands in it (your bank account).  Each requires different levels of security vs. convenience (usually a tradeoff).

I don't think the physical coin image helps explain Bitcoin at all.  It seems misleading.  Bitcoin is a virtual currency, that doesn't require any coins.  Yet they keep flashing those coins in most of the news flashes.
I think the reality is that news outlets need SOME image to go along with their stories, and until the Bitcoin community comes up with a better image, they'll continue to use the coins.
