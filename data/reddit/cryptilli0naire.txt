I can see both sides. However, In order for them to regulate a technology, they must categorize it (money, stock, property). This will inherintly push cryptocurrency into a box. We are so early in the technology, so I do not see benefit in regulation. We are at insane growth rates in the industry. This is the worst time to regulate.
Also to address your comment. Technically they actually do have the power to regulate coins. As long as they treat them as an asset and know which wallets are connected to your person, They can take as much of it as they want via taxes and put in place rules regarding usage and such. Same idea for owning any other type of asset. If they don’t like how we are using our crypto assets, they will force regulations down our throat to limit the power of our coins. This why we must fight to limit regulation.
@_date: 2018-03-14 02:18:30
Well said. Similar to how businesses dodge taxes by keeping money off shore
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:48:58
Seperate question. Maybe you know more about this than I do. I’m still confused on whether or not bitcoin is traceable back the the person. Because if it is, then they can criminally charge anyone who makes transactions that are unpermitted by law.
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:59:46
Fair. Seems to be the majority opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-25 09:01:38
This downplays the value of bitcoin imo. “Hey if bitcoin doesn’t work out, remember blockchain is the real value”. Stop. It’s all about creating a globally accepted store of value. The only people that will benefit directly from blockchain itself are the developers and people that work in that industry. If bitcoin succeeds and we are the hodlers, we will be directly affected.

I think we could agree that the only advantages crypto should have over traditional banking should be rooted in its decentralized nature rather than its lack of regulation.
Clearly the reason for the gigantic “bubble” (which gets alot of hate) has something to do with a lack of regulation.
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:06:55
Ok but I think that people are going to use third parties for convenience. What we need is distributed applications that are built on the blockchain that are decentralized like bitcoin so the third party itself cannot be censored.
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:11:32
Yea haha. What is proper regulation for bitcoin. Do you see what I mean? I wonder how people in the cryptocurrency community think it should be regulated. This should be a thread on the cryptocurrency reddits. There isn’t enough awareness here imo.
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:45:50
Heres what I mean. Say bitcoin becomes used by the masses. They run the payments through channels like bitpay for convenience sake. Then the government tells bitpay they have to reject certain transactions. This is effectively censorship.
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:52:06
I am fully aware that this is why bitcoin is so volatile. Why do you think we cannot influence regulation??? They always win. We can still influence the regulations to a large extent. Do you want Crypto to remain innovative? I am not saying that I alone can affect the regulations, but I am saying that if we as a community believe that what they are imposing is unfair, we should push against it and assert ourselves.
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:07:07
Yes, Bitcoin does not recognize jurisdictional boundaries, therefore regulation will destory this unique component of the technology. Are you saying it cannot be regulated because it exists outside of regulation?
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:04:23
Usage is still a factor obviously. You cannot have a currency that is not used. We need to start using bitcoin and stop hodling.
use bitcoin

How many people are considering shorting BTC. Be honest?

Hahahaha. I thought the same thing before I did it, but for some reason she just layed there the whole time as I was putting it on and didn’t move, so it was pretty easy. It took me like 5 mins to get it on and off.
I think it’s because she’s bullish on bitcoin, so she doesn’t mind it.

Lol. Won’t buy you one, but I have some for sale if you’re interested. I’ve gotten a complaint about the pricing, so I might cut it to $74 if I get enough people complaining that $84 is too expensive.

Can anyone relate?
