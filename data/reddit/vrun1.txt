The payment in question was not to, or from "James Kang", and both the sender and receiver of the funds were U.S. based, verified, business, Paypal accounts.  If you follow OFAC's advice ( this should never have gotten this far.

Until two old white guys in black suits show up at your front door...

It's triggering solely on a match for a name...in this case in a field that's neither the sender or receiver.
And, the "different path" is this:
"Give us the date of birth for that person or we shut down your account".
With the additional context that we don't know the person's date of birth, and would have no reason to know.  And if we did, why would we share that?  There's no warrant.
And the final kicker that Paypal did happen to process the incoming payment from this person...and that transaction was NOT flagged.
Or, in short, Paypal has taken a Government requirement and implemented it in the most ham-handed way possible.

Based on this info: 
It sounds like Paypal is doing a loose match to "James Koang Chuol", a General in the South Sudanese Army.  Against a "MEMO" type field.  Ugh.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:46:02
Oh, and to test your theory, I just sent another $1 to the Red Cross, without the magic triggering words.  It went through without being flagged.

If you read the OFAC guidelines, the language is more geared around identifying accounts that have an *actual* risk of being associated with OFAC listed entities, and marking/holding transactions to and from those accounts.
I can find nothing that talks about blindly matching text in a memo type field to the list. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:56:12
It appears to only flag the account that *sends* the money.
The receiving Paypal account, as far as I can tell, is not affected...other than they don't get the payment until the issue is sorted out.
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:08:29
At least I gave fair warning :)  Hope it works out for you, my account is still popping up the scare screen when I login.  They reversed the transaction, but no indication yet as to whether they will take action on my account.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:42:27
It's a fairly common name.  This all started because we received an order on one of our website from a person with this name.  It happened to be an order we fulfill through a wholesaler, versus one we ship from our own warehouse.
This wholesaler likes to be paid via Paypal, so our convention is that we send the payment with a subject line like "Order  Customer John Doe".
Then, what's described above happened.  To confirm it was a stupid text filter, I then sent the $1 to the Red Cross, using my personal Paypal account, and the same thing happened.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:27:33
If anyone is adventurous enough to try it, I would love to hear if the results were the same for you.
- Pick a charity, or somebody to send $1 to.  (I sent $1 to paypal )
-  In the "Add a note" (new Paypal UI) or "Subject" (old Paypal UI), area, put something random but make sure the words "James Kang" are in it.
On both our business, and my personal account, this results in the transaction being marked as suspicious.  Then, 24 hours later, Paypal threatens to shut the account down unless we obtain, and share, personal info about "James Kang".  See screenshots here: 
We do already pay one supplier in BTC, so it will never be an issue with them, but my other suppliers aren't quite ready for that.

Someday soon, a terrorist is going to change their name to "Payment" or "Thank You" and get themselves put on the list.   Maybe that's when Paypal will rethink the "loose string matching on a memo field" approach.
@_date: 2015-01-23 14:30:26
If I owned the major exchange, the risk is this:
-  1 U.S. based account, for which we have extensive information on, sent a relatively small transaction with the words "JAMES KANG" in a memo field to a second U.S. based business account (again, have extensive info on)
- The SDN is question is some general in the Sudan with a somewhat related name "JAMES KOANG"
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:18:45
I'll go out on a limb and guess that Coinbase are doing something more sophisticated than "transaction contains the string &gt;James Kang&lt; somewhere in it".
@_date: 2015-01-23 14:02:15
The small transaction to the charity was a test done, from a different account, *after* a previous transaction triggered all of this.  
The previous transaction was not to a charity.  It was a sub $300 payment between 2 US based businesses that was neither to, or from, "James Kang".   That name was in the memo field, however.

"Discounted rates for registered 501(c)(3)s"
It's either 2.2% + 0.30, or 1.9% + 0.30.  ( vs 2.9%/0.30 or 2.2/0.30 for a regular business)
So, discounted, but not "fee-free"

|it's also a requirement that every Financial Instituionin the United States has
Sorry, calling B.S. on that.  They are not required to manhandle a transaction that mentions a name on the list, especially given that:
a) The payment was not to, or from, that person.  (in fact, the transaction *from* someone with that name was NOT flagged)
b) There's nothing other than a specific first and last name to trigger it.
Even the notoriously unpopular "No Fly List" does more than just match a first and last name.

Unbelievable crap from Paypal.  I wish BTC were mainstream enough for us to stop using them, right now.
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:37:50
No, I'm guessing Coinbase is doing something more reasonable than Paypal.
String matching names, with no other criteria is just dumb.  Even dumber when it's matching a memo type field and both the sender and receiver are clearly NOT that person.
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:31:59
The name is question is also clearly neither the receiver, or the sender, of the funds in this case.  The name is simply mentioned in a memo field in a Paypal transaction between two U.S.-based certified Paypal accounts.  Paypal has extensive information of both accounts, including corporate Tax ID's.
If you read the guidance, most of the "screening" is supposed to be about marking accounts that have a very high likelihood of belonging to SDN's....then managing payments to/from that account.
There's nothing in the guidance that tells you to do stupid things, like text-match common names against a memo type field.

For anyone considering Stripe for accepting credit card payments, consider that their rates are awful.  2.9% + 30¢ per transaction is terrible.  Shop around.  While shopping, also keep in mind that there isn't a standard for showing rates.  Stripe is using the "honest way", so while their rate isn't competitive, they are at least showing the actual cost.   
If you find something lower than about 2.2% + $0.25, they are probably using the "dishonest" way of showing rates, where they don't include network fees, or disclose that certain card types (reward cards, for example), come in at a higher rate.

At $10k/month in volume, cc transactions via Paypal Pro are 2.2% + $0.30.  There's also a mid-point rate of 2.5% + $0.30 if you do $3k/month. (
If you have any notable volume, 2.9% + 0.30 *is* awful.
