Why not both?
Daytraders and people living in free countries can still use centralized exchanges.
Others in oppressive regimes can use decentralized marketplaces. And they will help protect the centralized exchanges because of the argument *if we ban it, everybody will just start using Bitsquare*.

I guess it would only be risky on you since your company doesn't hold btc.
A way to remove risk would be the daily average way, although for a company that doesn't hold btc it would be a waste of time for them to buy btc every day, rather than buying it all in one go once a month.
For a more closed-loop btc economy I reckon the daily average way would end up being the way it's done.
It's relevant because I'm thinking about the case of trading goods and services with volatile btc myself on a standing order basis like this.

You trade bitcoins for cash. Settle by sending cash through the mail. They hold your bitcoins in escrow.
It's pretty small for now. There's no real reason to use it given that other methods are easier. If all clearnet exchanges get banned it would be an option. Also it doesn't use 2-of-3 transactions so they could run off with your coins.

Suppose we measure value in gold coins. Supposing we bought in one gold coin worth of bitcoin 300 years ago (around the time the USA was founded)
At a constant 10% growth per year, today those bitcoins would be worth 2 x 10^12 gold coins, probably enough to fill the entire solar system.
So no, the value can't rise forever. Even for recorded history that is unsustainable.

This is really important. If OP gets an account at an exchange he can run an ad on localbitcoins so his entire village can trade bitcoins.
edit: for remittance.
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:44:10
If he uses a payment provider like BitPay he'll recieve local currency and just report that income to the authorities as normal.
If he accepts bitcoin on his own he could declare the equivalent government currency as income based on the bitcoin exchange rate on that day. Then when he sells or uses the bitcoin he could declare them as capital gains (or losses)
I would recommend the first way because the second way turns your dad's business into a speculator. His business is to repair laptops not to speculate on the value of bitcoin. On the other hand it's likely he'll get very few sales at all so the effort setting up bitpay might not be worth it.
Another thing, bitcoin becomes more useful when there are more places to spend it. If you own bitcoin you'll benefit from their rising value indirectly caused by you accepting them. Even if nobody uses bitcoin to pay at your shop you still might profit.
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:02:08
It depends on the product being paid for.

Site certificates are used for ssl, they are useful so that a third party cannot read what is sent between your browser and the server. That's why they're used in online banking and stuff.
However nothing secret is sent between your browser and the bitaddress.org server. All the address generation is done client-side. So it doesn't matter that the site certificate is broken.
It's recommended that you Save As the website and run it locally, verifying that it still works once you've unplugged the internet. Even better would be to run it on a fresh OS install or a LiveCD.

So to help explain. A great application of multisigs is a 2-of-3 transactions.
There are 3 private keys, 2 of which are needed to spend the coins. Each key is held by the buyer, seller and arbitrator.
If buyer and seller agree, they both sign the transaction to send coins to seller. If there is a dispute the arbitrator signs a transaction with either the buyer or seller.
It's much better than using an escrow because the arbitrator can't run off with your money. (As users of Sheep marketplace found out)

Mining pool centralisation is a problem. The owners of BTC Guild, GHash.IO and others might be honest but if they get hacked and used to irreparably damage bitcoin. Look at what happened to other altcoins that got 51% attacked.
You don't even need 51%, even with 40% you can reverse 6 confirmations much of the time.
Use p2pool. Don't buy into group buys of mining hardware unless they mine on p2pool or other ways that don't result in centralisation.
It's possible to donate to p2pool so that the miners get your donations as well as block reward and tx fees.

Another way is to watch people withdraw it from an ATM, then you don't have to count it either.

The problem with mtgox is you cannot withdraw fiat USD from it, so the price is artificially inflated as people buy bitcoins to transfer out value.
You could try localbitcoins.com where you send money to people in your area using bank transfer in return for bitcoins. The website runs an escrow service so they don't just run off with your cash.
Otherwise you could try the bitstamp exchange, it is like mtgox but has a better reputation, you can withdraw and deposit money.

The conspiracy would be vulnerable to free-riders. Say you all agree to buy at 12:00, one self-interested person could buy at 11:55 and then sell at 12;00 after the price has gone up, thus making a large profit off you.
Individual self-interest would probably destroy that kind of scheme.
It would work if you somehow forced or convinced everyone to be a good collectivist and not a free rider. Maybe you could form a syndicate where everyone puts money in and one person decides when to buy/sell to manipulate the market. Maybe you could use ideology and custom to convince people to go along with the group.
All this stuff is probably already being done, bitcoin is an unregulated (unregulatable?) market so all kinds of manipulation can happen.

For mixing btc, the IRS will do the same as they do for cash. Demand to know where you got it if your spending obviously outmatches your earnings.
BTC is like internet cash. If you've got ways to launder btc you could probably do the same thing for cash. (e.g. falsely running a cash-intensive business)

By the way, you dont want each station storing its (master) private key because your employees might use it to steal funds. Better off just have each station store only the (master) public key with the private key stored in your own office.

From the FAQ:
"The price in Bitcoins will be displayed at checkout on completion of purchase. Please send one full payment and not multiple payments from different accounts or your order will not be processed."

It's possible to have electrum only store the public keys.
Yes, the best way for now might be to have a single bitcoin address for each station. That's not the best practice since it reduces privacy but quite frankly you won't get many customers paying with bitcoin.

The designs are wonderful.
However it's really not helpful to invent new names, especially without any kind of consultation with the general community
You say you like the swiss frank, but they still call it "200 Swiss Franks" and not "1 Helvetic Goose". Numbers themselves are nerdy but everyone still has to learn them.

BIP38 writes about encrypting a known private key, but bitaddress.org has not implemented that part. So it's possible with other scripts but you might fuck it up. Look around bitcointalk.org if you really want.
My advice is to generate a new encrypted wallet and transfer to it.

The article compares bitcoin's revenue to the total transaction volume on the blockchain. But not all blockchain transactions represent actual economic trading.
In that period I moved my coins from a webwallet to Electrum, the velocity of money from that transaction is zero so why is thegenesisblock including it in it's calculations?

Why not send him a new address? We have email now. Same for rent payments and other recurring payments.
If you don't like that, you could use a deterministic wallet, where you give your employer a master public key and they generate a new address in the sequence every paycheck.
At home you've got your corresponding master private key which you can use to spend every address in that sequence.

Satoshi replied to that. The good guys need to be collectively larger than any single bad guy, otherwise the bad guy will make more money just mining bitcoins honestly and so will become a good guy.
Satoshi suggests bitcoin would reduce spam by making botnet owners switch to mining.

Look on  and  around Croatia to see many other places.
Bitcoin makes a lot of sense for holiday accomodation bookings. Tourists often book months in advance and want to secure their booking by paying a deposit. All other methods (paypal, wire transfer) have silly fees and conditions so bitcoin should be a clear winner long term.
Thats why all these villas are giving discounts.

Video  "you can always leave" doesn't seem to address the point that you can always leave. Unless I'm missing something, but I just watched the entire 11 minutes.
I think of it by analogy with renting a home, if you don't pay the rent the landlord will send men with guns to throw you out. But it's not theft because you can always find another landlord with a rent you can afford.

A successful double-spend with zero confirmations requires a significant proportional of total mining power.
60 Ghash/sec costs about $1500 (Avalon ASIC)
Total bitcoin hashing power is ~4 000 000 Ghash/sec
So do the maths yourself, to get a significant proportion of total mining power is very expensive. You'd be spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to double-spend for a $5 cup of coffee.

If you're super-paranoid why are you trusting us randomers on reddit?
With your level of paranoia you shouldn't use the printer unless you understand in every detail how it works and know you can trust it.
A much better way, I think, is to print an encrypted paper wallet so you don't have to trust the printer. And then write the decryption key on the paper with pen.

See this quote from bitcointalk forum by the moderator gmaxwell.


Just to get that straight, brainwallet.org appears to have been created **specifically** to steal people's coins.
Read that entire thread to better understand brainwallets. Humans are not a good source of entropy, if you really want to remember your wallet then generate a **good** random number and convert it to a mnemonic phrase like the Electrum client.
Or you could just use paper wallets.
EDIT: Hey thanks for the downvotes. I'd just rather not see cracking weak bitcoin brainwallets turn into a viable industry for people with no-longer-competitive mining equipment.
