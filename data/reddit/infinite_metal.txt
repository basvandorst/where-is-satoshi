A fork is a fork. Doesn’t matter how it ends. A fork has to have two chains or it isn’t a fork. I see both BTC and BCH as forks of bitcoin. 
Litecoin has a different genesis block. It is an alt.

Or AXA for that matter.

What about before 2013?

Yes old enough wallets will ignore the modern network. This is because of past changes. The difference between them and BCH is that miners have continued to work on the BCH fork.

If that is your definition of an alt then BTC is also an alt...

Has BTC had forks prior to BCH? Ones that competed for the same hashpower?

Took a look. There have been other forks. 2010 and 2013 at least. 
Many seem to have already accepted BCH as bitcoin. It is the literal definition of a fork. Calling BCH an alt makes me think you either don’t understand crypto, or have an agenda to push.

For most transactions simply seeing them broadcast was enough. 
Before fees were an issue mixers were a viable option.

BTC used to be fast, predictable, and confidential (or able to be used confidentially).

This junk product is the reason the growth of the btc blocksize has been stunted.

Bitcoin mixers used to be inexpensive.
Historically users could choose the level of risk they were comfortable, enabling them to accept 0-confirmation txs when they deemed appropriate. With BTC constantly at full capacity one can no longer rely on 0-confirmations even with the most trustworthy of counterparts. The tx could simply be dropped from the mempool before it is ever included in a block due to wild fluctuations in required fees.
