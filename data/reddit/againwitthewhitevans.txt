You don't. Also you would get raped by the tax man. The ability to convert to real assets is still an issue which I don't know how it'll get solved without getting boned by the government.

I don't think this is as cut and dry. Money needs to be convertable to tangible assets to actually have value. At the moment most of the value in BTC is via its convertability into usd which can be converted to tangible assets. If the govt wants more BTC, they print more usd and buy it. If they can manipulate usd then they can manipulate everything else. This is why there is an asset bubble in houses, stocks bonds etc. There is probably a bubble in regards to usd also but not at the fault of BTC. Ideally BTC would be universally convertable but I still think that dream is a way off. Also because the tax/legal issues are made deliberately complex. Unless the common person can know what the price of milk is in BTC it's going to be problematic. There is a really good book called the 'power of gold' which is an economics history book that covers a lot about how the abstract concept of money developed over time. This is a lesson that fiat currency really shit all over.

Have you tried to teach your grandparents to surf the internet? I don't think people are realistic about how computer illiterate some people are.

Faith of what? The faith comes from the faith in the people that deliver into it. What I mean by that is, some person has to make bread for instance and have bitcoin and want to trade bread for bitcoin. The value of the money is the aggregated value of the real commodities that are exchangeable using said currency. That's why the dollar is more valuable than the ringgit for instance.

I think i jumped the gun. Github are protesting NN rather than them being singled out. There was press in the UK saying they wanted to shut down github since it provided cryptography for terrorists which is why i was wondering.

Is the attack to github under net neutrality related to this? I mean come on if you are trying to replace the monetary system then you're going to piss a lot of people off.

This could be the case simply because the dollar will be in the toilet. It doesn't even need to mean that bitcoin is worth that much.
