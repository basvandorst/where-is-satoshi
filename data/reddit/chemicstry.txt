Channel is opened with a single funding transaction that locks funds in a special way. To create a mutual funding transaction you need cooperation between Alice and Bob nodes to both sign the transaction, but this is not yet implemented on any LN software (I might be wrong). At the moment, funding transaction is created by single side and has funds on that side only, but this is purely due to alpha.

Sure, I'll add that to channel info display :)

Me :) If you have any questions, you can contact me on discord Intel Or here. But I may lag to reply.

At the moment, yes. Every node can see the full network. I am not really a protocol expert, but I think in the future there might be some kind of filtering once the network gets huge.

You can not fund channel from both sides atm (planned in the future i think). That's why it's still in alpha. Although you can transfer some of your funding money to the other party when opening channel or when transacting within LN. These channels could also be for testing purposes as the client does not limit how many channels you can have between same nodes.

channel is supposed to be the same color as the node which opened it, but it's a bit buggy now and mixed up. Nodes can freely select color and alias on their software.

some find testnet boring when you can't lose money there :)

Pretty much shits and giggles, but some have bought tshirts/stickers from blockstream store. I wouldn't recommend anyone to use LN on mainnet yet though, as almost everyone here has lost some satoshis due to bugs/updates. Software is still being heavily developed and there are no migrations from previous versions yet (which means you lose all your channels when updating).

For lnd you need to apply a pending pull request that adds bitcoind support and some additional changes to get it to run on mainnet. I haven't tried but I heard that clightning runs on mainnet with bitcoind without such hassle.

Already did with VivaGraphJS. Now it loads much faster but takes a while to stabilise. Although that lib has some neat server side layout modules, that are going on a todo list.

Thanks. Just uploaded:

The recksplorer will be updated in the upcoming days. I'm currently exploring options on physics optimisation, precalculation on server or a switch from force graph all together. It's really hard to balance between features and usability.

17 nodes already! :)

Stop believing bullshit that BCH solves scaling problem. It is just a temporary fix until you need to increase blocksize even more. Firstly, it will promote network centralization because small nodes will not keep up with the traffic. Later, they will bump into computer hardware limit where you physically can not process more transactions.
One way for proper scaling is lightning network which is currently being tested on BTC testnet. It will allow thousands or millions more transactions than the merely 8x BCH improvement. There are other scaling solutions being developed (ETH has some interesting ideas), just look it up. And stop believing this BCH bullshit.

Sorry if it sounded as if it was targeted at you. I meant it for these BCH supporters commenting without any arguments.

It's not trustless like submarine swaps, but it is cheaper as you can pay multiple invoices with single onchain tx.
@_date: 2018-10-03 11:39:36
No, it just forwards payments through a regular lightning node. Submarine swaps have an advantage that they are trustless, but their larger script means higher transaction fees. And in case of LN payment failure, you have to pay those fees multiple times.

It does not and it is not intended to do so. It is more of a tool that may help in some cases.
