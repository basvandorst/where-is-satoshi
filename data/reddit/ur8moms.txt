with respect to btc? obv every graph is downward rn -_-
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:09:42
fee is pretty significant gotta say. u can exchange at changelly, shapeshift or in multiwallets like cryptonator. but if u r sending btc u might want to wait out till mempool's cleared and day trading is risky business i tell u
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:58:09
Yeah. Makes sense
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:08:57
was it on a hardrive/computer or an exchange site? if hardrive, search for wallet.dat file
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:13:03
try forgot password. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:04:34
yes. that is normal(not talking about the magnitude of fees) 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:32:43
they take our fees like they r doing right now

i dont have much experience with ledger etc but i jut want to say do not transact now. ur txn will be stuck in a limbo or u have to pay sky high fees. get to know about the process and wait for the mempool to clear up a little

@_date: 2017-12-17 17:49:39
Is your account verified? is it coinbase u r using for btc? yes this tends to happen with verification. try another exchange
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:47:08
i agree with u. bitcoin can only be useful when people are able to use it. we do have to remember anyway that we are still seeing the infancy of bitcoin. it has a lot to develop on and rectify

@_date: 2017-12-17 17:46:56
i think u can claim it as mined btc but the exchanges would obviously ask kyc so u gotta take care of that. What u r asking about kinda borders on money laundering and exchanges obv try to prevent that. U better talk to an expert for in depth country laws

not always
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:18:33
basically the mempool is all clogged up because of the arbitrage. ur transaction most likely will be dropped if u didnt give sufficient fees

why the fud? coz btc is about to touch 20k? dont make the mistake i made once. i have seen btc tumble down but it will always come back up stronger

A question about trading: does trading volume affect the price a lot? 
I mean .1 btc sold at $1500 or 10btc sold at $1500 have same affect on price?

im guessing eth will stabilize between 750-800. Dash near 1000 (hoping). ltc: no clue, 340-350 maybe. Btc has become too bulky to moved now imo. We'll probably see steady increase till 18k before any dips

if it is a significant amount, u probably should consider it like u would consider gold. Confirm with a tax lawyer. I would ignore it was insignificant tho
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:15:50
different markets different rates. people take advantage of this difference(arbitrage) Why else do u think the mempool's all clogged up

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:07:09

@_date: 2017-12-08 10:24:06

@_date: 2017-12-08 08:56:29
now is a bad time for txns. mempool is filled up and fees r high. coinbase doesnt allow editing of fees as far as i know
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:30:52

@_date: 2017-12-09 17:09:10
hodl strong brother. I remember the first time i experienced a dip. I bought at $7200 but then within 2 days it dipped to 5.8k I almost wanted to sell but this sub gave me hope. Now im sitting on a nice profit even though its a dip. Dont let fud get u. May the HODL Force be with you

fees. by then it is expected that bitcoin will be mass adopted enough to cover for the bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:55:10
bcash has forked when there where disagreements in btc community. Bcash has a "CEO" roger ver where as btc not like that. just i gotta agree about the txn speed and fees of btc which ahs to be sorted out by lightning network. Anyway, follow whatever coin u want to

im doing whatever i can do but i can only edit and a human pace and not catch up with btc
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:40:11
nothing is gonna stop it now!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:14:56
and already 17.5k
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:22:41
miners mine only the txns which are most profitale for them. now 275sat/b is more profitable for a miner than 10sat/b. if u want ur txn to go through u need to pay appropriate fee

@_date: 2017-12-08 07:20:28
depends on ur location. if from usa, use coinbase. i would prefer if u dont do any transactions right now as the pending transactions have climbed up to an all time high. u r right "earn btc free" is just bs. take care that u dont fall prey to phishing and other scams
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:20:22
As mempool clears price will go down as the txns r just result of the arbitrage. The fluctuations u see r normal
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:32:45
These are turbulent times. The Mempool is filled to brim with txns and therefore the fees have gone sky high. Miners pick only the transactions with highest rewards. we must wait for our savior The Lightening network to save us from this peril

coinbase doesnt operate in my area so i wouldnt say im the best guy to talk about coinbase. But according to what i have seen online, i guess if u r from usa, u should proceed with coinbase

@_date: 2017-11-28 16:45:40
I dunno man. I don’t use cex. What is ur transaction id ? It can be used to get the fees u sent it with. If the fees r too low, it may take days to get it done.

@_date: 2017-11-25 18:39:56
public wifi is a breeding ground for "man in the middle" attacks. The passwords used to log in, account details, keys etc can be routed through a third person and then to the actual destination. This method can also be used to increase "phishing" effectiveness as the attacker can redirect cause the wallet site to redirect to a fake one which still serves the purpose but yet steals the credentials. This way the user wont even know that his/her credentials r stolen. This btw applies to the vendor too. So having a secure wifi or making them switch to 4g is better way to do transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:24:03
no one can be sure now man. u might wanna wait and see the markets

@_date: 2017-11-13 00:43:37
yes. only if u can afford to lose 70% of the value(this goes for any crypto). Yes, I expect btc to go up after a day or two. If u buy, Hodl strong brother!
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:36:43

@_date: 2017-11-13 20:56:37
wouldnt that mean mempool getting stagnant again??

@_date: 2017-11-13 00:31:36
if u have btc. hodl it. If u have bch, sell it when it seems profitable (or dont, ur judgement). Right now mempool's being cleared of the spam and panic exchanges of bch hype phase. So, any tranfser u make might take some time. The prices will stabilize only after the pending txns go through. If u r feeling doubtful of btc, dont judge rn. Now is NOT a good time to judge ANY coin. Peace :)
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:04:32
fiat bubble wouldnt happen in near future i guess. Have u seen how low the rates r xD

saw it on coin dance. looks good at the first look, but i wanna understand it more
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:23:11
Take ur time for the verification and other formalities. And jump in once the pool’s cleared. Rn there r many unconfirmed txns ( mine’s stuck too ��)
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:58:12
more like calm after the storm?? :P
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:10:44
i agree with u. i want a dip to buy some coins before it shoots to 9000 :(

I guess u came in at best time possible in this month. BTC
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:54:35

@_date: 2017-11-25 18:57:22
u dont pay fees to buy btc. the fees u pay goes to the exchange platform in form of usd
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:34:04
I personally use blockchain as coinbase is not available in my country. I only had once problem to talk about which is the high fee rates to have a good transaction speed, but that I think is the case for all of the wallets out there. Check with others to see how the fees r and the transaction speeds of coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:59:48
I think theres a way to tag as meme/info/speculations etc. Seen it on other subs. Personally, I love memes and love to post too but i feel guilty whenever i post coz it would dilute the important content
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:31:14
I’m kinda a noob here. What exactly do u mean by adaption point?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:59:35
there is nothing wrong in diversifying. so go ahead and buy some *the coin the cannot be named* but ditching btc completely is bad idea imo. it may rise in a day or two
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:55:57
what was the immediate effect of the forks in the past?? a small dip or a steeper rise??
And is this hard fork any different from the ones in the past?
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:11:50
even im searching for that man. ive heard ppl talk about the sub called r/btc :P
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:22:54

@_date: 2017-11-13 00:45:26

@_date: 2017-11-13 19:49:28
yeah, this is bugging me too :(
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:28:57
U the real mvp. I just wanted to say that
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:21:17
$5 every few weeks? The transaction fees will be a bitch in the current situation. The portion I would be spending in fees would not be worth it if it’s just $5. I suggest u buy in bigger instalments, fewer transactions. And also get into the btc once the pool’s cleared as situation rn is not good at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:04:56
rsi is..?
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:17:39
Thats true. even for a guy on the sidelines, the forks, changes, schemes(scams) involved would be interesting study
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:20:46
I got my news from reddit :P. that was withing 8-10mins of the announcement
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:44:13
u'll anyway be stuck due to the clogged pool
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:32:01
One does not simply force memes. 
Ill see what can be next time i have the chance tho
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:45:02
The post u commented on gave me the idea I admit. I’m sorry (?) that our ideas were similar ��
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:47:29
Im kinda betting on bitcoin to emerge victorious from this but im only doing so as this is just a hobby im doing rn. Maybe u should diversify to a few others little. Ive heard that altcoins tend to climb up a bit after bitcoin fork, so there's that. but again diversify: if u wanna play safe u might wanna convert some to conventional money
PS: this is just my view on. I hope u keep these points in mind before making a well informed decision :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:30:38
great! i hope u contribute well to btc :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:35:32
Same here, my man. I am a college student too and bought about 0.01BTC 2 days ago. Planning to ask .2 BTC worth currency from parents and talk about the investments in this immediately **after** the fork. 
Coinbase is quite reputed and u can continue using it for a while. Though consider hardware wallet as u start putting in more money in BTC, just so it is safe.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:37:30
i would just like to ask: the hash rate of bth is higher that btc (3hr etimate) according to [ has this ever happened before?
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:10:06
Btc would have never gone down if silk road guy werent caught, just saying :P
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:38:40
I know. The portion i cashed out is a meagre minority. this is the "dip fiat" which ill dump when btc dips down the next time :)
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:34:16
 :'(
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:46:40
The transaction fees u pay are only paid to miner. Right now, if my understanding is correct, miner is paid the btc and the transaction fees
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:14:09
are u srsly complaining now? mine's been at it for a day and a half now. gotta wait for the miners to be back

Oh. ok is it ongoing now? how is this affecting btc and its price? Price wise, im guessing a pump and maybe a dip after that..?
PS: im also gonna ask about the tethers thing. All i know is they r some currency pegged to usd
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:06:22
Wake me up when the bull run ends... (green day ref :P)I need to buy at dip

im guessing resistance at 10k (like we saw at 8k but this time higher). therefore price goes down below 9k and builds up slowly breaking past 10k. this is what i think may happen(hope it happens. i wanna buy more)

monero probably
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:44:45
im not sure they do, bro
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:41:04
sure. first step to the golden lambo :P
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:01:16
Thank u. This what I wanted
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:54:22
Well. That’s as far as I can go. I don’t don’t actually use coin base so..

@_date: 2017-11-13 21:33:18
how much do u pay in fees??
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:50:28
DO IT!! if u r sure u can pay off the loan go ahead rn
Regarding the whole coin thing u asked, im assuming u want to know if fractional bitcoin can be exchanged back. yes, it can be- just read the TnC of whatever u r using just to be sure. ( my currency is rupees, so deal a lot with proper and improper fractions)
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:12:32
it **will** go up tho. wont it?
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:54:05
is there a way to do this via tor??
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:57:01
i day trade in altcoins, somewhat successfully :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:33:05
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:03:14
i dont get why higher fees??
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:38:58
just gotta be patient and hodl :P
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:45:25
looks like it started. hodl strong brother !
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:55:16
it'll dip for a while then shoot up i guess. Lot of fud ppl's txns r still in the mempool. And after they r cleared out, boom!
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:49:50
yo, dude. i guess u r drawing some unwanted attention mentioning how much u have rn and ur age (hackers). how the hell do u have that much cash tho?!
PS: i would say put in 1k gbp at $7000 ( too lazy to covert to gbp :P ) and lil more at $7100. have 2-3k gbp with urself. put some in alt coins if u want to. 
PPS: just saying what i would do if i were in ur place.

oh, sure man. its not for profit im doing this. I love the idea of bitcoin and blockchain. Its an innovative idea for avoiding centralization and bank control. tho nothing wrong in getting that too on the side :P
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:05:36
hola fellow indian. thanks for this :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:14:05
its an indian website. but im sure there r other alternatives. google it
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:33:30
had a similar idea. is it possible tho for the prportion to be dynamic and depending on the difficulty etc
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:25:39
Obv the users. This is just a shit post so don’t nitpick now :P

@_date: 2017-11-16 00:12:51
U do know this just a shitpost right?
I do hope that comment was sarcastic :P
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:44:36
Im glad there were no hurt feelings :)
u could tip me in bch too. just so u know :P
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:28:34
that would be a minority of the population( im speaking in terms of percentage) We have a population thats so high that even a minority looks like significant amount of people. (1%  of 1.3 billion is 13million. so..) And one more factor is that the economic need for btc has not come yet. People don't take risks with investments a lot either
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:39:51
I think the fees r the major proportion in the rewards the miners get. so it shouldnt actually matter when btc is adopted in large scale and a lot of fees flow in
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:00:43

@_date: 2017-11-06 23:35:48
Do u remember the rate of the transfer and the time it took? Maybe next time u can adjust the rate for slower transaction when not necessary 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:50:11
Bcash 2 is the real bcash. the currency previously know as bcash should be called bcash legacy or bcash depreciated
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:25:27
other coin had a fork. we have slightly lower profitability
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:12:10
The last time i did this Segwit2x was announced. its a trap &gt;:(
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:28:23
wait for the miners to be back. its gonna take days
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:28:11
Anyone who gives offence to a shit post is premo dick :)
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:09:21
oh. I get u. thanks for that :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:34:17
buy rn and wait for a dip
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:23:00
wtf r u doing here bro??
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:23:45
well, went for it :P ill probably get downvoted a lot but fuck it 
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:39:31
uh, sure. why tho?
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:23:21
i mean, what is the result of each finally?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:46:32
im considering beijing's time, which is 4:45AM right now. so yeah, 3-4hrs
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:56:19
bad timing man...
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:42:16
would u like a gif of this? :P
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:59:22
Yep, already on it :P
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:14:57
i trade with abt 10% of my investment across 7 altcoins (fairly successfully). But for the past few hours i have not found a coin which is going up. fml xD. I decided to hodl that to until the currencies start rising 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:11:20
have u seen the other posts in the sub reddit? it ll go up. this is not a peak. btc may even fall now. i suggest u to put in some of the money rn and the rest later depending on market
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:07:45
wtf? ltc now??
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:49:03
ive fired it u too :) hail btc!
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:04:17
Dip is dip. Doesn’t matter the way it came down 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:44:25
This was the price i bought at :(
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:07:36
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:20:29
This is a stable and healthy rise. Last week’s dip was a correction for the rise which was due to the fork fiasco. And also people bought at dip, the price rise now is good profit
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:16:50
made it meself, my man

Yeah.. i had to sacrifice a puppy to the dark overlord just to stop that.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:02:54
companies would only do it if they get profits right?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:19:15
such fud, much wow
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:51:02
btc can at least be resistant to spam and have reasonable txn speed. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:20:59
What if he was behind this?
*places tinfoil hat*
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:46:08
thats really high man. yes, u got a bit lucky but fee u paid is really high in general. I had txns with 10sat/b once
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:29:21
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:33:09
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:52:04
wont miners be lesser on our side? especially when we have a backlog to clear..?
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:06:47
b-cash already has a small dip. hopefully continues that way after a few hrs :)
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:57:37
no problem. Peace :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:38:18
GODS I WAS A HODLER THEN!!
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:51:52
im piggy backing on this and gonna ask: how r these happening? the pool's full and there is virtually no txn happening now
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:08:45
Yes, I beg the meme lords to do this
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:49:26
I hope lightning network solves the problem..
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:44:26
every surge has a dip. wait for it to come back up
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:34:48
I think its gonna be some while before it does. still a lot of txns to be processed. after that BOOM! HODL strong brothers :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:37:09
huh. 104sat/b here :(
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:31:32
the drops r the best part of a rollercoaster. buy and hodl :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:47:59
exactly. why isnt it is still resistant to these stuff! :(
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:38:03
yes, actually. it may increase too :(
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:11:21
I’m glad it appeals u too :)
