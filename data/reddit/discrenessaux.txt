This is the most ignorant thing I've read today. This absolutely won't happen for several reasons.

Because the exchanges, who manage all paired trading of cryptos, set the current price based on trade volume.

Bitcoin's value is not and cannot be backed by the bitcoin community.

I encourage you to read this article. The last paragraph outlines how a certain blockchain company's product (Blocksure OS) is actually aligned with the new regulations. GPDR can only help companies ensure security of users' data. You say it will hurt blockchain but since all (effective) blockchains already encrypt, pseudonymise, and minimise data (which isn't even user data), they really don't have to worry about compliance with these standards unless the companies involved are recklessly designing, implementing, and deploying new blockchain tech.

You misunderstood what I said but that's my fault. I meant that they encrypt private keys so the actual data that is "owned" by users is protected. I understand that the point of blockchain is public access to transaction history but the data that is really the user's is protected. I agree that Bitcoin does not comply for the reason that we can translate addresses to identities but this is an issue specific to Bitcoin or any blockchain that doesn't provide true anonymity. My whole point is that this issue is not inherent to the Blockchain concept nor all blockchain implementations. It does affect Bitcoin for this reason although one could argue that since GDPR only applies to businesses it really won't affect the Bitcoin network itself, at least not directly. Long story short, GDPR only affects shitty blockchains like Bitcoin.

Maybe? I'm honestly not familiar with every blockchain in operation right now. I'm especially unfamiliar with those operating in the EU. If a coin doesn't offer these things anyway then, in my opinion, it should be subject to scrutinizing regulations.
