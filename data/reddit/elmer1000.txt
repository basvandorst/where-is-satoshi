had the same problems a few months ago (but no picture of myself holding an ID) I followed the instructions carefully (color image, high res, no redactions) got verified.
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:47:59
Who is the artist? 
@_date: 2014-05-20 17:59:22
yeah, you're right - router problem on my end - sorry about that

their altcoin operation ScryptX is going to be hosted in the same facility. This should lower the overhead cost for both operations.

link seems to be broken!
any word on when this will be in operation?

Maybe, don't know... was just pointing out that the interview was not the only 'event' that coincided with BCH price jump
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:44:02
Which one? Maps shows 4+ Rovereto in Italy.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:34:36
BCH price jump could also be related with open bazaar refusing LN and adding BCH

Erm, lightning is offchain transaction so it kind of is, isn't it?

You are right; no new light is shed but your comment suggests OPs reminder is well in its place.
The reason for bitcoin was an alternative to centralised national currencies with shady control systems ("banksters "); an economic experiment to prove that we do not need local currency controlled by local institutions. 
The whitepaper is literally the definition of Bitcoin, if Bitcoin has moved away from the whitepaper then it is not Bitcoin.

Great post, and good compilation of links - thanks

Is this simply your prediction or are you quoting something? If you are quoting something I would like to see the source.

Seams very plausible. 
My personal guess (based on nothing at all) is that the price will rise a bit from the other exchanges because there will be a lot of B(it)libers that will see it as a chance for cheap coins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:37:58
do you think people will move their bitcoins to other exchanges or simply cashout? As I understand MtGox is by far the easiest exchange to use for people in the US.
@_date: 2013-09-13 08:28:53
well, I can't really disagree with you (though I suspect trolling is afoot) but those worthless papers with $-signs on seem to work - so why not BTC? It does look to be the better of the 2 schemes.
@_date: 2013-11-14 12:20:54
While I agree with you that it is not actually instantaneous. Using bitcoins in the real world can be (in my experience) as instantantaneous as using a creditcard - faster actually. 
I paid for a haircut with BTC and the owner accepted my payment as soon as he saw that I had made the transfer. The payment was not in his wallet as i left, but if I had used a creditcard the payment would not have been in his account before I left either.
Basically he trusted the bitcoin network as much as he trusted the bank. 
Confirmation of payment can take quite some time but actually "paying" is instant. 
tl;dr: It is instant in a way

thanks for the link. Any chance for a tl;dr? there is a lot of info to go through

WTF happened there? Maybe traders hungry for volatility should be looking at the EURO/BTC market.

Ask and ye shal recieve:

+1 for public website - maybe wit line drawing tool for drawing trends

yes, I am considering this - also as an incentive for the receiver to learn about bitcoins. I have talked about it but it is different to experience it for yourself.
The question is how to go about it?
I'm thinking a QR-code with a few mBtc on it and instructions to download a android/iPhone wallet.
What do you think woudl be the best way to give coins as a present to a n00b?
Edit: heey, it my cake day! which also means I have known about bitcoins for exactly  one year :-)
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:51:40
WHUT!? Do you have anything to support your claim or are you just trolling?
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:49:41
blockchain.info has served me well and a easy to use android/iPhone app (mycelium or a any other) is a must for real-world purchases.
