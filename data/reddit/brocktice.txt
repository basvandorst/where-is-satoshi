The more people use SegWit, and use LN for small transactions, the more the fees for on chain transactions will drop. I don't think we'll be seeing fees that high in a year unless there is some crazy explosive growth in btc transactions.

Hahaha the alts only exist and have any value at all due to Bitcoin. They're 99.9% garbage that people are just gambling with.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:51:58
Ether is much younger (shorter history covered by its blockchain) than Bitcoin and already it's very computationally intensive to run a full node.
Maybe they'll find a way to fix it, maybe it'll have a good run and die off, but network effect means that tying to Bitcoin directly will be more secure.
Just my $0.02, I think side chains and other layered technologies on Bitcoin will kill most alts in the next 5 years.
EDIT: Downvote me, ETH fans, sure. But you're in the wrong sub.
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:10:44
The Bitcoin source code changes a lot. What you are thinking of is the consensus. This has been separated out. The miners and full nodes have to agree on the rules, or the network forks.

The Bitcoin blockchain is much older than ETH, and I just set up a few full node, on a VM with 4GB of RAM and gigabit NFS to a NAS. It synchronized in about 12 hours, and that's with the download.

Beware, this is what happens when the developers don't think about and plan for scaling. Bitcoin is growing faster than I think the code is ready for, but the core developers are taking scaling seriously rather than focusing on the feature of the day.
SegWit and LN are out there, time for the community to make use of them.
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:51:50
Yes, but you'd have to wait until enough blocks were generated to get to the adjustment block. If a lot of power disappeared it could take quite a while.

I would argue that Satoshi wanted (and lots of other people want) bitcoin to provide fast, cheap payments, too.
Where I differ from the big blockers is that I think Bitcoin needs to stay more or less as it is while facilitating higher layer technologies that trade off the massive security of on chain transactions for speed and cheapness.
Luckily, we already have LN for that. Now it just needs more testing and an ecosystem. These things take time, and that's ok.

Even though I've been reading about LN for weeks and I'm even running a testnet node, I can see it's going to take me a while to really grasp how it will function in practice. I think there is going to need to be a lot of automation on top of LND (or whatever LN implementation you use).

No. Mark my words, most of the people in those alts are going to get burned. 99.9% me-too cash grab garbage. If you find something really compelling about them that makes you think they have what it takes to stand the test of time, maybe you're on to something. Otherwise, stick with BTC.

I don't disagree with you, except for one caveat. If you understand Bitcoin, you may decide based on that whether to go long on it or not. I did that years ago.
Short term trading is a different animal.
To support your hypothesis, I'm an expert in cardiac electrophysiology. Many years ago I sold some btc and was looking to diversify. I picked a company in my field with great technology that I thought would be a real sleeper hit and put $2k in their stock. Turns out they have some real barriers to market entry even though the tech is sound, and I finally gave up last month and sold my holdings for $90.

I would say it will be above 17 by the end of February with a very high likelihood, but it's been really volatile since November.
In my experience Bitcoin is a steadily growing phenomenon, it's always under attack and everyone always says the bubble is bursting, etc. With some corrections along the way it just keeps going up.
I'm not an expert or an oracle, but I've been doing the Bitcoin thing since 2009 and that's just how I see it based on my experience.

Network nodes do not have control of your funds. Either your transaction is relayed all the way to the recipient or it fails. Banks have control of your funds. Very different.

@_date: 2018-01-03 04:24:53
You miss the point. These transactions are nearly instantaneous and can be batched over a period of hours, days, etc, before committing to the blockchain. This means (a) LN transactions individually will be much cheaper and (b) the open/close transactions will have less competition for block space from all the small transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:24:47
Probably not since it has nothing to do with the amount of BTC.

As much as I dislike inflation, the US dollar is one of the most trusted and sought after currencies in the world, I don't know that this is a great comparison.
Keep in mind, block size increases are still on the core roadmap. They are prioritizing using the blocks as efficiently as possible before we start bloating the blockchain. I am happy with this plan, obviously some people are not. It's bad enough that I already need close to 200GB of storage to run a full node, and we are looking at doing this for a long time to come.
Given the value of the network, I want development priorities to be, in order of importance, security, stability, and THEN things like speed, efficiency, UX, etc. The more things are done off-chain and anchored to the main blockchain, the more things can be done with the security of bitcoin without the risks of changing the core protocol.
I realize not everyone has the same priorities.

I had a safe deposit box in New Orleans in 2005. After the bank flooded in Katrina, I had to go to a random warehouse to get its contents. They had pulled all the boxes out of the vaults around the city and stuck them in this warehouse. It was readily apparent that none of the vaults were sealed, the units of boxes were all rusted to wherever the water line was. Luckily my stuff was above the water line.
It takes nothing more than drilling out the locks to open one. All you have to do is imagine a scenario where the bank would do that (because compelled to by law, or otherwise), and you realize that it's not very secure at all. Also, what if the bank burns down?
Is it a good place to put some important documents? Maybe. Especially if they are copies. Otherwise, I'm not too fond of them anymore.

If you believe that the platform is sound and adoption will continue to increase over time, that people will actually use it for something other than speculation, then you should expect the value to increase over time.
If people are to use the platform, they need BTC.
If you don't think that the platform will be used in the long term, then it's merely speculation of the "greater fool" type.
IMO most of the money in altcoins is the second type, and there's plenty of people that do NOT believe in Bitcoin but do think they can make money from it in the short term, so some portion of the money in Bitcoin is of that type as well.
All us long-term hodlers saw the potential at some point and decided that we believed in the long-term potential of Bitcoin as something that would actually be used to conduct commerce.
EDIT: Getting rich by buying early is an important part of the incentive structure, too. Bitcoin works because of two things: technology, and the incentives baked into that technology. You can't look at one or the other in isolation.

That doesn't make any sense. They make money on trades. During volatile trading, volume is typically much higher. And you say capitalist like it's a bad thing.

I made a youtube video of the miner back when, looks like it would have been end of 2010/early 2011.

EDIT: Oh I see this was in response to a different comment than I thought. It was 2009 as I recall that I saw it on Slashdot, but I don't know, it could have been 2010. Clearly by early 2011 I had a miner and had paid it off.

I did some calculations the other day. It went from about a 7% MoM increase in 2016, to 8, 9, 10, 11 about a month apart starting in March 2017. Then it went rapidly to 40% starting in November and even with the corrections appears (for the moment) to be holding that.
It'll be incredible if that continues.

There are a limited number of Bitcoin and the ecosystem is slowly growing. Therefore on average price should go up.
If for some reason, nobody any longer expects anyone to want to use or have Bitcoin, price will drop instead.
Everything else in between is noise.

To echo the other comments, in sum: Bitcoin was fast and cheap too, when nobody used it. It was never as fast as LN is and neither are any other blockchain based coins. You don't have to wait for the next block, even if you're making a block every ten seconds LN is typically going to be faster.
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:40:34

I felt suddenly at peace after looking at the log plot of price over the past few years and realizing that even 5k would not be a large correction, but that 20k would still not be far off after that. You'd think I'd know better as I've been through all the corrections but I guess I'd forgotten.
(And yes, I know past performance is no guarantee of the future, but I believe in BTC long term for other reasons than historicism.)

Look up the issues people are having running a full Ethereum node. It's much younger than Bitcoin but it's having some huge scaling problems of its own. If BCH even lasts that long it's going to have the same problem.
You need to understand what Bitcoin brings to the table and what the others bring to the table. It's really in vogue right now to bash "old, stable bitcoin" and talk about sweet gains on new upstarts, but most of the others (I predict) will die away in the next ten years and Bitcoin will still be running strong.
Also, don't look at just so-called market cap or supply, look at hash power.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:41:34
If you want to catch the huge rise, the time to buy for sure was six months ago. If you believe in the fundamental utility of bitcoin, then buy any time and hodl. No way to know what will happen. Prediction is hard, especially about the future.
In the short term especially I expect the futures may lead to more wild swings and speculation. Longer term it will allow hedge funds to buy BTC and then short it on the futures market as a hedge, which means they are going to really start buying it as the futures market gets going.
*If* they believe it's a good idea, which I think many do.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:30:30
If you want to diversify I suggest something that's not a cryptocurrency, like a Vanguard fund. I'm not sure if you've noticed but most of the other cryptos follow bitcoin, both up and down. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:58:49
Most altcoins are me-too cash grabs copied from Bitcoin, including Litecoin. Ether is fundamentally different and interesting, as are some others. To be honest I haven't studied most of the many other options the way I've studied and understood Bitcoin, so apply salt accordingly.
Bitcoin has an enormous network effect, and far more security than any of the others on hashing front. Anything that can be done with sidechains on Bitcoin is not going to survive well long term as a separate entity.

I'm annoyed by Ver, but the forces at work are much larger than him. I do think (in retrospect) the price went too high, too fast, fueled by irrational exuberance. The degree to which price deflated (aside from the brief panic drop to 10k) is IMO an indication of how much of the price was from overexcitement. If Ver could pop that bubble with a little PR, maybe that means it was just a healthy correction.
Don't worry about it. One cryptocoin has the foundation to be the future of money. That's Bitcoin (core). The rest are coattail riders and wannabes.

One will be generated when you set it up.


I don't know anything about the Ledger. The Tresor will generate public and private keys from the 24-word seed above. Private keys stay on the Tresor, public keys are your bitcoin addresses that you use to receive.


Basically, yes. If it's a large amount I'd maybe send a small test TX first. Bitcoin addresses have a built-in checksum which helps protect you from typos. It doesn't protect you from using another (but wrong) address.


GDAX will give you a deposit address, and you send from your Tresor/Ledger wallet. Just the opposite of withdrawing.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:14:45
Any way to do this with Trezor?
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:28:41
All of the arguments that were made against bcash apply. It would create a hard fork. It would increase storage and bandwidth requirements, which would drive centralization. It would only be a temporary fix. It would require development work that is better spent on proper scaling. There are already other cryptocurrencies that address the speed and cost issues (and now there's bcash on top of all those).
I want proper scaling for the long term, not quick fixes that just kick the can down the road.
Don't forget, too, the problems with Bitcoin are being greatly exacerbated by the bcash tx fee spamming every difficulty adjustment. Yes, it's a vulnerability, but one that requires a large bankroll, and it's not likely to happen often.

Ah the bcash people are back...
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:08:51
Seems to be fine for me now, I guess they got back from the BCH party.

Are you 100% certain the address is correct?
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:14:18
Just broke out, methinks.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:22:17
The attack was the coordinated selloff, media blitz, and surprise announcement of coinbase support all at once. It seems bcash can only succeed through deception.
Edit for typo.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:07:46
It's a way to make small rapid transactions off chain while periodically synchronizing to the blockchain. Go read about it, it's actually really cool. I'm excited for it to get deployed.

It's working, you can use it on testnet. You can even use it on mainnet but I wouldn't recommend it.
Look, Bitcoin is very stable and well-tested at this point. Yeah there are TX fee and congestion issues, but I'm confident enough after almost 9 years of using it to send ~$500k in a single transaction (after a small test to be 100% sure the address is correct). I don't want to lose that reliability with lightning network, I want it tested first.
Core devs are acting responsibly by being good custodians of the stability of the system that carries enormous value every day.
TL;DR: It works, you can use it now, but it is VERY STRONGLY recommended to wait to use it until it is better tested.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:12:46
Lots of comments like yours from BCH trolls lately. It didn't seem quite the same to me but some people probably thought it was.

I'm not into technical analysis, I just know when it drops and suddenly people buy, there's strong support around where they start buying. On GDAX volume is the gray bars underneath the candle sticks.

Sure, I agree, short term. It doesn't look good for the longevity of bcash, though. The writing is on the wall.

I think they are primarily short (as a hedge) but holding bitcoin, so I suspect if they are short they are not the ones driving the price down.

Bcash is different because it is trying to represent itself as Bitcoin in a misleading way. See: bitcoin.com, @_date: 2017-12-26 03:50:42

Their plan is to milk ASICBOOST for all it's worth until nobody wants their forked coin anymore. They are avoiding SegWit at all costs because it breaks that. Why else would they go to the trouble of engineering a different malleability fix?
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:42:39
It's overvalued as long as it's above 0.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:14:13
I don't really understand the question. I think there are a lot of people with deep pockets that are long on bitcoin. Doesn't mean it won't go down for a while, either on its own or with market manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:30:57
It depends on the reasons for the drop, liquidity between BTCTurk and other exchanges, currencies, traded, etc. The tougher it is to move BTC and fiat currencies in and out of an exchange, the more disconnected the price can become from other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:29:01

Anything with depth charts. GDAX is very responsive, you can see it on Bitcoinity too.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:02:49
It's going to get forgotten along with litecoin when lightning network is deployed. There are other coins that offer some real advantages for different applications but bcash is not one of them.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:53:57
Buy on GDAX with a limit order, transfer out for free. Boom, no fees.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:32:22
Yes. We can always make it more divisible. It'll just increase the value of what's left.

@_date: 2017-12-31 03:10:46
I'm gonna make it so dry for you...
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:19:22
So if I'm a miner, why would I mine a version of BTC that will never have upward pressure on fees, and will also stop giving me coinbase reward transactions sooner than BTC? That's a suicidal incentive structure.
EDIT: By the way, you're correct, thank you for helping me learn more about BCH. Now I know that it's even worse than I had originally thought.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:24:32
Oh, and don't forget the giant sell walls attempting to hold price down the last few days.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:39:45
If you do it with limit orders, then there are no fees. It's a little trickier than market orders though.

Thanks for the clarification.
EDIT: TBH I never followed that stuff much until recently, I figured I'd just wait and see where consensus went, but lately I've been following it more closely as some of the forks have really done damage to the image of Bitcoin (IMO). This is part of why I want to start mining again, so I can have a say, however small. My post asking about the state of mining hardware the other day got no responses, though.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:02:18

I saw some reports over the weekend of people saying GDAX withdrawals were slow to show up as pending.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:41:13
This makes bcash look super legit and trustworthy. It's not the real SegWit2X. It really is a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:33:11
Interest is at a fever pitch right now, lots of people are trying to transact. Meanwhile the space per block (1MB) for transaction data has not increased. As that space is fixed and in demand, the going rate for a transaction is high right now.
As new technologies like SegWit and Lightning Network are adopted, some of this scarcity will be alleviated. Likewise, if the Bitcoin fever dies down a bit then there will not be as many transactions (regardless of price) so it will be easier to buy transaction space in a block.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:39:32
*eyeroll* They say all kinds of strange stuff over there, it's quite the echo chamber.
This is like a bunch of different sects interpreting the Bible. There are many ways to read what Satoshi wrote and interpret it. Whether you feel he would find decentralization more important, or fast cheap on-blockchain transactions more important will influence your interpretation.
I *personally* feel that Bitcoin Core is more closely aligned with Satoshi's motivations and vision, but that's me.
What are the motivations of the people that wanted BCH? Well, the biggest motivation I can find is it preserves ASICBOOST and profits for Bitmain. This increases centralization which damages one of Satoshi's main goals -- decentralization and no need to trust an intermediary.
EDIT: I guess you have to ask three questions: 1) What aspects of bitcoin are most important to you and 2) what aspects are most important to the success of some flavor of Bitcoin? 3) What's the best way to balance those things?
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:23:56

I lived in New Orleans during hurricane Katrina. Let me tell you, safe deposit boxes aren't as great as you might think.
Here is how you should think about this.
Use a password on the trezor. Then someone can't get your btc with just the seed. Put the seed in a ziploc bag inside a fireproof box and store it somewhere reasonably safe in your dwelling. Maybe transcribe the seed and put another copy in a bag inside a safe deposit box.
There's also the (rather pricey) more robust cryptosteel device for a physically hardier seed storage mechanism.

@_date: 2017-12-10 22:45:28
Indeed, the price difference is an indication of liquidity issues. I think GDAX has been higher than others lately because they allow credit card purchases, for example.

Certainly could be a bit overvalued. That said, most people don't realize that almost always on a linear scale USD/BTC has looked like a hockey stick graph. If you look at a log scale for all time history it's got a pretty steady slope, though that slope has in fact gotten a little steeper over the past six months.

Dude, take a deep breath.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:17:43
How is it shortsighted, a quick fix, and beneficial primarily to those with a particular financial interest in it?
It fixes transaction malleability and Merkle tree collision mining while also providing a modest boost to effective block size (or TX capacity), without precipitating a hard fork. It enables lightning network and other such improvements. Seems like a lot of short and long term benefits to me.
(Minor clarifying edits)
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:01:37
Thanks for the clarification. I've only seen the ever increasing thing discussed (edit: not in an official statement or roadmap), and it's implied by the block sizes being tested (380GB, 1TB, etc). Do I understand correctly that the next limit without a hard fork is 32MB?

I recently (October) used HitBTC to swap my BCH for BTC. The site seemed a little sketchy but it worked just fine for me.
Now, HitBTC is one of the few exchanges that does SegWit and batches withdrawals. I'd like to possibly give them my business. However, to get verified they want me to email (!)  identity documents.
Have you exchanged large values on HitBTC? Did you get verified? Did you have to talk to support? If so, how did it go?

I think it's going to be a reserve currency and distributed ledger for the world. There will be many services and technologies tied into it. Think a combination of the Internet and the Linux kernel (the latter being an open source project that is used in and interoperates with thousands of other projects).
I'm sure there will be many crises before then, forks, BIPs, etc, and eventually one chain will weather them all until it's something nobody really thinks about or talks about anymore like we do here.

Sell and cut your losses, or hodl and wait. Bitcoin was not ready for mass adoption yet, all this runup is still speculation that it will be widely used in the future. And no, the fact that everyone has heard of Bitcoin or considered buying some doesn't make it "mass adoption".
If you think that's true (I do), then just hodl and wait. Some of us have been waiting almost a decade for Bitcoin to grow and prosper so far. Wanting it to take off NOW is a bit like wanting Netflix in 1998. It would have been great, but the infrastructure just wasn't there to make it work well yet.

Some of us hodlers have been through many, many crashes and everyone saying it's a scam and a Ponzi scheme and worthless, and everyone saying it was a passing fad like beenz and flooz and beanie babies.
We've been through that crap for almost nine years. Look, Bitcoin is the honey badger, it don't give a fuck. Yeah, if you bought some at 19k, it sucks ass for you right now. You may never get it back.
I would (and have) bet a decent chunk of change that Bitcoin is a world changing technology and social phenomenon, and it's going to succeed no matter how many people talk shit about it. I think anyone saying otherwise needs to take into account that their arguments are (mostly) quite old, have been done to death, and so far, have been proven wrong.

A hard fork splits users. It creates a sort of alternate reality and another ecosystem. Just look at bcash. It also inflates bitcoin in a way, which is a big no-no as the 21 million limit is a big selling point.
Now, imagine if every time we wanted to upgrade bitcoin, we had to create that situation anew. It would be terrible for community, terrible for the brand, and possibly economically disastrous.
A soft fork keeps everyone together and preserves the soundness of the blockchain. Remember this. Anyone that advocates for a hard fork is doing the community a disservice, unless there is a technical reason (security flaw or whatever) that absolutely requires such a fork.

LN has been implemented since then. You can run it on testnet, or even mainnet if you dare. It definitely needs more testing, but in those 2 years they did the thing.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:20:25
I had a fair amount of bcash when it split. As soon my wallet had support to split them out I did so and traded them on HitBTC for the real deal.
If you want something faster and cheaper, go with LTC or ETH. Bcash = garbage.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:11:46
LN transactions still require blockchain transactions, and are not considered to be secure enough to send amounts greater than ~$100. It's essentially a mechanism for batching many small transactions into fewer larger transactions. There will still be plenty of fees. The difference is that the small transactions can happen much faster and cheaper, while retaining the security of the main chain for longer time frames.
EDIT: Where is the line drawn for bch? What is an acceptable transaction fee before block size should be increased?
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:22:06
I think that would be a pretty tough nut to crack at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:36:23


You haven't heard of any hedge funds interested in Bitcoin? Then you're not paying attention or you're deaf. The people in the finance industry I've been talking with seem to think that they wanted the ability to short bitcoin while buying to hedge their position. Before, some hedge funds were buying, but they had very limited ability to hedge their investments.
With the launch of LedgerX, CBOE, and CME futures, that changed.

Excellent comment, my sentiments exactly. It seems to be in vogue to bash Bitcoin, but core uses BIPs and polling, they are looking after a valuable system, and I'm glad they are not in a rush. Bitcoin is not ready for this crazy volume yet, but it's not time for it to be used by everyone yet. We are still in the early days.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:15:27
You clearly just want to misrepresent the actual effects of deploying LN. Why don't you just go spend a bunch on some more spam transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:00:47
Last I checked they are still batching BTC withdrawals and covering the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:57:37
Honestly the most expedient is to take your business to an exchange that does support it, if you can. I am trying to do so but I lost my 2FA token for Bitstamp and they are taking forever to process my re-verification.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:39:21
Easy to get fiat in, no fees to get BTC out, but fees to get BTC in. Therefore, it's better for buying BTC than selling, which skews the price.

@_date: 2017-12-25 15:32:38
What's stopping the average Joe is typically problems moving currency between exchanges quickly enough or in enough volume to equalize price.
The extent you see different prices on different exchanges is basically an indication of these problems, otherwise someone would keep doing it until prices equalized.
If you have gobs of money you can keep pools on multiple exchanges and that gives you a buffer on timing to move currency.
It's also a lot of fiddly work so ideally you want bots to do it for you.
EDIT: High btc tx fees also cause this. For example, it's free to move BTC out of GDAX but not Bitfinex. Therefore you have to move enough BTC to make enough profit to overcome the fees if you buy on Bitfinex and sell at a higher price on GDAX, because you have to pay a TX fee to transfer the btc from Bitfinex to GDAX. You also have to wait for the transfer to clear and the price can change a lot in that time.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:01:47

It's beyond supporting bcash. They did a really unprofessional bungled surprise announcement/release of bcash trading. They seem to lock up and kill rallies (just due to system load I think). They also are perceived as dragging their feet on segwit, either due to technical challenges (most likely) or some conspiratorial alliance with bcash (less likely IMO).
They have had some days recently where withdrawals were severely delayed, too. Nobody likes the feeling that all their money is in limbo.
I tell you what though, they sure beat Mt.Gox!

It's a short-sighted quick fix that benefits its "leaders" in the short term. However, its changes in incentives vs the original Bitcoin mean it will eventually die out when its pumpers no longer benefit.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:20:21
It's only good in the short term for the people using proprietary mining hardware. As you can see, however, the road map is very bad for miners. This is what happens when stupid people change the Bitcoin default parameters without considering how it affects the incentives.

So every hard fork is an opportunity for a veto by miners, a possible schism in the community, etc. The bcash community seems to be much more comfortable with hard forks than Core. Do you think the reliance on hard forks could be a liability to bcash? If not, why not?

Proof of stake is the wrong incentive. You want to motivate the people that make the network run, and make it secure, not the people that are the richest.
Look, people focus on the technical aspects of Bitcoin, but the incentive system is at least as important. The two work in an intricately interwoven way.

I think it's pretty obvious, there would have to be absolutely no demand, or near enough that for all practical purposes there was no demand.
What could do that? A devastating flaw in the code and/or crypto algorithms, a coordinated campaign by governments worldwide to destroy it, some sort of mass hysteria.
I doubt it would lose *all* value overnight, but it might lose most of it. It would probably take a few days at least, because there would be people buying it as it dropped in the hope of a rebound.
Ultimately, what would cause nobody to want it, anymore, forever? Use your imagination. 
EDITED to add: FUD alone won't do it, Bitcoin has lived with FUD since day 1.

If they had convinced everyone to use a solution that was compatible without a contentious fork, they would have retained their advantage with bitcoin core.

It has no advantages over other currencies like litecoin. Ask a btrash advocate what makes it better than litecoin. It's just a fork of Bitcoin taking a shortcut to solving the transaction fee / block size problem with nothing to recommend it but short term improvements in performance over Bitcoin. It's pumped heavily by the people that hold it, mostly with FUD. Ask yourself, why can't it win on its merits, since it's supposedly so great?

You can have channels open to large hubs and send through them to anyone else with channels open such that there is a path through the network.
Edit: to be clear, the exchange would never have control of your bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:57:19


The short version is it's a layer on top of bitcoin that lets users form a second network. In this network payments can be sent instantly. Creating and destroying links in the network requires transactions on the blockchain. All transactions that happen in the channel are synchronized back to the blockchain when the channels are closed. You can send through the network by hopping a bunch of nodes that all have channels, i.e. if A&lt;--&gt;B&lt;--&gt;C is a network, A can send to C through B, A does not need a channel with C.

I don't know if you are a tech person, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you simply have not read about the lightning network.
The lightning network is already working, mostly on testnet, a little on mainnet. I've actually read quite a bit on different models for how it could play out, and spent some time working on setting up a testnet node (though I didn't finish, holiday distractions). Just today I was thinking about a good model for running a zero-knowledge lightning wallet service.
I guess we'll see.

Because that has costs. Why don't you ask the btrash folks why they don't implement SegWit and LN?
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:50:05
Their goal is to always increase block sizes when blocks get full. That means fees will never rise to compensate for the phase out of coinbase transactions (block rewards). Therefore, eventually, they will be worthless to mine, nobody will mine them, there will be no security, and they will be done. 
Furthermore, they are currently producing blocks faster than core, I think because of the emergency difficulty adjustment and miner games. This means they are rapidly mining rewards now, while ASICBOOST hardware still has an advantage, but they will run out of rewards faster than core. Then we reach the scenario described in the prior paragraph.
It's possible at some point bcash miners will refuse to increase block size, but then they are back to square one.
Core has the right solution. They are building LN to move small transactions off chain to make them cheaper and faster, while retaining the integrity and incentives put in place by Satoshi.
The more I learn about bcash the more I realize it is destined for failure.
(edited to fix a typo)

Yes but you're going to pay transaction fees so you'd better make enough profit to cover it. I suspect people are already doing that (with bots), so the cost difference may be explained by the transaction fees. Not just BTC but possibly wire fees and such.
 This is called arbitrage.

Please describe how SegWit meets that description.
I define the original Bitcoin in this instance as one that had never been hard forked, or more importantly, one where the core parameters had not been changed in a way that affected incentives.
As for pumping, there's a key difference. In my opinion, bcash is not sustainable and it's only being supported by miners now looking to get ROI on ASICBOOST while they can.

As someone that used to be part of a group of people (mining co-op and so on) that are now surely whales of various sizes (from 50BTC to thousands of BTC held), this doesn't really pass the smell test to me. Most of the whales are True Believers.
Given how badly hedge funds and the like wanted to be able to get into BTC, how much they pressed for futures, I suspect it's more likely that those funds are the ones buying, and some whales trying to diversify are the ones selling.

Hi. I used to do a lot of mining. In hindsight, except for cpu mining very early on (already had the cpus), I would always have been better off buying BTC and holding it with the same money.
Back then, if Bitcoin crashed and burned, you at least had some sweet video cards. Now you've got a pile of useless ASICs so it's not a great hedge anymore.

If there's a certain demand for new coins that balances with supply to reach a given price, then I believe the reasoning is that if production drops price will rise until demand evens out.

No, the relationship between public and private keys is a bit like meat that's put though a grinder.
Technically there's a way to put the ground meat back together, but it might as well be impossible.
EDIT: I meant to include, there's a mathematical relationship between the two keys such that it's easy to derive the public key from the private, but vice versa is nearly impossible. There are a number of functions like this that are used to implement various public key systems.
A good function is computationally expensive to execute with a large key space such that it would take a very long time to try every possible input to come up with the output that matches the public key.
@_date: 2015-05-01 04:10:08
 The answers about different block contents are accurate. However, the winning hash only has to have a certain number of leading zeroes (it's been a while, something like that) and be a valid hash of the block. So, even with the same contents, aside from the nonce, there are many possible winning hashes, where iterating the nonce iterates the hash.

The recommendations to research the existing information are correct.
Unfortunately, the things that make bitcoin what it is are not simple, and each ties into the others. If you really want to understand it, you're going to need to commit some time to understanding. The ELI5 level you probably already know.
Distributed network of computers securing the network using expensive cryptographic proof of work, processing transactions between addresses, which shuffle around the bitcoins that are doled out to those doing the work. Beyond that it quickly gets more complex.

@_date: 2015-05-18 02:29:01
The network effect is just a hurdle. If something comes along that has truly *compelling* advantages that Bitcoin cannot incorporate, then it may overcome the network effect. Bitcoin caught on because it has a number of special properties that no previous solution had, all tied together. (Edit: Also Bitcoin doesn't directly compete with fiat currencies, it's a different beast and fiat isn't mined. Altcoins compete with Bitcoin for mining power or mining capital.) (Edited typo)

Fiat vs fiat cannot be equal because in a given location one (the local one) will generally be superior in terms of acceptance, particularly when dealing with the government. Each one is also strengthened or weakened by the policies of various governments regarding currencies. For example, a government may fix exchange rates to try to prop up the local currency, or ban the use of other currencies.
@_date: 2015-05-18 03:05:04
You're not reading the whole statement:
"An initial imbalance between two nearly equal media of exchange will benefit whichever is more widely accepted until a single one overwhelms the rest. There is no limit to this effect: ultimately one would always expect a single currency to overcome all its competitors."
Bitcoin and fiat are not "nearly equal", they're very different as I've already stated. This is about multiple decentralized cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2015-05-18 01:27:30
Nothing wrong in principle. In practice they tend to have technical weaknesses relative to Bitcoin, and of course, they lack the degree of network effect Bitcoin enjoys.
Edit: Let me preemptively say that frequently the technical weakness is that someone thinks they've come up with something better than proof of work for mining. This doesn't even touch on the pre-mining issues.
@_date: 2015-05-24 13:27:00

The difference is that bitcoin doesn't require you to trust the third party.
EDIT: To be clear, as long as you are simply sending bitcoins, not using something like circle, the miner that includes your transaction in a block never has a chance to take your bitcoins, that's what I mean when I say you don't have to trust a third party. Those other payment methods you mentioned make it possible for the intermediary to keep the money.

Nope. I have my ways of accessing my bitcoins now, some cold, some hot, which I haven't gone into for a variety of reasons. I just wrote all that up in a text file and double-encrypted it for those discussed in my comment.

That's a very high-level outline of what I did.
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:52:15
What I have done is encrypted the information necessary to access them twice: once to the person who gets them, then again to the person who is to execute my will. If I die, the executor will decrypt, then pass to the recipient who will decrypt again. This will provide only instructions and required information to complete the other steps to retrieving them.
I trust both of these people well enough for this setup, plus I'd have to be dead or long absent not to notice the retrieval steps happening after the decryption.
Good topic.

It's helpful to think about the limit cases and changes in value.
Say as a miner you make a certain amount of btc on average per day. You also spend a fixed amount on electricity, assuming you max out your miners.
If price goes up, that daily amount you make has increased relative to your fixed electricity cost. There's an incentive to bring more mining capacity online.
If price goes down, particularly below breakeven, you're dumb in most circumstances to keep running your miners. Even if you think price will go up, you're better off spending your money directly buying coins than buying electricity where you are guaranteed to lose money. So you shut your miners off and leave the mining to people with lower costs still making a profit.
When you bring miners online, blocks are found faster and difficulty will increase within about two weeks.
When you take miners offline, blocks are found more slowly, and difficulty will decrease within about two weeks.
Higher difficulty means less btc revenue for each miner, lower difficulty means more. It's a feedback loop. It's also fucking brilliant and I continue to be amazed by how clever it all is.
@_date: 2015-04-28 03:38:55
No. It also adjusts down. If mining is too expensive, fewer miners will be kept running.
Edit: to spell it out, this means the total cost of mining adjusts to what the market will support, which is not directly related to price. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 03:27:09
You're forgetting that difficulty adjusts to the amount of mining.

Bitcoin is useful person to person and is more useful in that regard all the time. Frankly, with Circle for example, it's quite easy to go bank/cc to btc and back, and it's fast.
Try to think bigger though. Think about what bitcoin can replace in the back end. Think about the machinery behind something like Western Union, all the security and trust required, all the people. Almost all of that can be replaced by bitcoin, and with superior functionality.
Also, it's misleading to say that bitcoin hasn't caught on -- look at the transaction figures recently published by bitpay. Bitcoin has never been used more, its use continues to increase. I'm not sure what criteria you have for "catching on".
@_date: 2015-04-29 13:15:17
This is so demonstrably false as to verge on crazy, as already demonstrated by Gundalf. I love bitcoin and have my qualms about the federal reserve, but fiat currency (as a flexible form of currency) solves a lot more problems than it creates.
Your one valid point is that historically it seems that the gold standard has been dropped when someone wanted to wage war.
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:44:37
For sending arbitrary amounts of fiat it's currently less useful than it could be, and much less useful than sending BTC. I've sent tens of thousands of dollars worth of BTC before, but only for BTC-&gt;BTC transactions.
Bitcoin is still in its infancy -- it will need to grow a lot more before the scenarios you're asking about will be simple and commonplace.
@_date: 2015-04-12 17:24:47
I don't know about you but I don't change my master GPG key very frequently, and this has nothing to do with bitcoin specifically. 
EDIT: Also none of that information is in the will, it just says who gets what and that the executor has instructions and permission to follow them upon my demise.
@_date: 2015-04-28 13:21:23
When people find out I've been involved with bitcoin for a while, they often ask about ponzi schemes and drugs, and why I'm interested in it.
I tell them that bitcoin is important because it allows sending arbitrary amounts of money anywhere in the world in seconds for very small fees, and does not require a trusted third party.
@_date: 2015-04-28 04:01:15
Bitcoin has a built-in set of incentives designed to bootstrap the most secure method of storing and transmitting money ever devised, imo. It seems to be playing out perfectly. Security and scarcity beget value, which begets more security.
To see the feedback in action, compare graphs of hashrate vs price.
@_date: 2015-04-12 19:07:26
Right, plus like I said I'd notice the steps after they got the instructions decrypted.
EDIT: this setup also gets them access to most of my other stuff, it's a bitcoin-agnostic solution. Multi-sig and others are specific to bitcoin.
EDIT2: For example, this is not my setup, but would work. Put in the instructions, "there are safe deposit boxes in my name at banks X and Y, each has data storage media with my encrypted master key in it. Retrieve either of those and then [further instructions]."
I don't much trust safe deposit boxes alone for a variety of reasons, including what happened to mine in hurricane Katrina, but used like this they could strengthen such a setup easily and inexpensively.

I can't see how it could really be a positive thing. Bitcoin depends upon the reliability of the network. The good news is that a 50% attack doesn't grant the attacker full control of the network. It only allows certain misbehaviors and only with some difficulty. This can also be mitigated by people spinning up miners that may have gone idle due to power costs, for example.
Normally the incentives are for anyone mining that much to follow the rules, although as you point out governments or other enemies of bitcoin won't care about those incentives.

My experience was that it was not an issue, but I was very up-front. I said, "I'm going to be using a LOT of power. Is that OK? Will we need to adjust the rent?". This was an old office building in a downtown major metropolitan area. They said, "we have no way to meter the power, and I guess we just won't negotiate on the [price per square foot] rate." Ran about 44 GPUs there for over a year, no problem.
My recommendation is that you be up-front about it. Get it in writing if you can that they don't mind if you use a bunch of power. Keep in mind proper office buildings usually have commercial electricity rates, which are much cheaper than residential rates.

I don't understand the obsession with paper wallets. You're much better off with an 'offline' wallet created with something like vanitygen using a trusted, offline computer. You can then encrypt the private keys (I recommend gpg with a smart card or cryptostick) and back them up all over the place (Dropbox, Mega, Google Drive, etc).
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:22:44
I'm happy to pay tips to service people, and I almost always tip well. If the service is mediocre, I tip 10-15%. If it's awful I still usually tip a little, because you never know. 
The difference in service where there is little to no tipping and/or table/tip sharing is like night and day. I am appalled at the service I get in restaurants in much of Europe, and I think this is a big part of the reason.
I agree with others. If you want to spread the bitcoin love, that's fine, but it should be on top of what you'd be tipping without the BTC. Can't believe anyone would tip only BTC in an establishment where BTC is not an established payment method.
EDIT: To clarify, when I say table/tip sharing, there are some restaurants where all of the on-duty servers are responsible for your table, and tips go into a shared box. There's a restaurant in Baltimore I used to visit that did this (because I loved the food), and the service was 99% of the time awful. If nobody has specific responsibility for your table, and a small share of the tip goes to everyone, there's not much incentive to provide top-notch service. I understand that people can still be professionals and do well at their jobs as waitstaff without tips as an incentive, but the overall effect is going to reflect the incentives that are present.

It's about to get a lot more secure with a lot less power. First-gen ASICs will see to that. Later generations will benefit from moving to smaller feature sizes. As it is, their number is stupid.

You can think what you like. I have a stable diskless Linux cluster running cgminer. Scrypt requires upgrades to the AMD SDK, fglrx, and requires much more power and heat because the memory can't be under-clocked. On cards that have been mining 24/7 for years, you're much more likely to have problems with the memory controllers and such. It's just not as easy to mine LTC en masse.

This (EDIT: Jed McCaleb, to clarify) is the guy who made MtGox, which was riddled with security holes until MagicalTux took over. I'm not surprised.
EDIT2: Given the response from the developer above, I will admit that I am wrong in this case. It appears the password is actually stored client-side. That said, I remain wary of Jed's work.

The comments on that post restored my faith in humanity just a little bit. First time in a while I've been happy I read the comments on an article.

People don't understand that all of these feel-good alternatives will never replace a true store of value. I just finished reading a horrible article about how, oh, we've learned so much from Bitcoin, but it's fundamentally flawed. That is absurd. Nobody wants to store the fruits of their efforts in a currency that is losing value.
EDIT: people also don't understand how crucial proof of work is. Proof of work makes Bitcoin secure, which gives it value. Beware any p2p money that does not involve proof of work. Ppcoin is trying to use proof of stake, but I've yet to see an explanation that convinces me it is as secure as proof of work.

1. [This]( is a much better link to explain the Wörgel Experiment
2. When nobody has any money, it makes sense that forcing people to spend money will improve things. However, it's a corner case. In the world in which Bitcoin coexists with other currencies, most users are not going to have zero money to start out with.

I agree the pools should not be so large. I wish people would spread out more. I use a pretty small pool. This is part of why I ordered an avalon.

Wat. I have 6 GH/s in my garage. If my DSL went down that would do it.

A fair point, but it's important to remember that the Bitcoin foundation is not the same thing as the network. The network is absolutely decentralized.

Take it from an experienced miner, LTC can be mined on GPUs, but it's a big pain compared with mining BTC.

I happy to see them, and have upvoted some, but maybe they should have their own sub?

Thanks! That's my first received bitcoin tip.

Thanks, it's been so long since I started mining and researching all that that I forgot.

People are trying to hype litecoin right now to drive the value. It has absolutely no advantages over Bitcoin.

I've always had good luck with bitinstant, but only for sending USD to my MtGox account. And I haven't done that in a month or so.

It's not going to wipe hundreds of servers over several different services. Still, I can see the arguments for a paper backup *in addition* to encrypted online backups. Having lived through hurricane Katrina I know better than to trust paper copies, even those in a safe deposit box.

Considering that ASICs are a pretty general technology that can include SoCs with RAM built-in, I don't see what prevents using RAM with an ASIC.

Wuala is secure and accepts Bitcoin.
EDIT: Actually, their Bitcoin page now redirects. Not sure if they're still taking Bitcoin, but I used it with them in the past.

I don't think anyone will make ASICs for litecoin because I don't think litecoin has any compelling advantages over Bitcoin, and it lacks the network effect. That said, why the hell would someone not make an ASIC because you need some memory attached? RAM is dirt cheap these days.

You're assuming miners can and will increase their expenses until they equal the value to produce the coins, but that is simply not true. Mining hardware is a serious capital expenditure at this point and carries some major risks. Not only that, it's hard to come by. I've been mining at 6-14 GH/s for 2.5 years and my expense has rarely been anywhere close to the value of the coins produced. Ppcoin is pretty new, and seems to still have a lot of weaknesses. Not only that, it relies on proof of work to bootstrap, and centralized checkpointing (for now). It's a laudable effort, but Bitcoin has a cleverly arranged set of incentives to help it grow and stay secure. It will be interesting to see what new innovations follow from Bitcoin.

Actually it makes perfect sense, it allows you to access files as of they were local without downloading. You can also synchronize individual folders like Dropbox. You can use either method or both, plus backups.

You could ask the owners of ProtoParadigm, they accept Bitcoin for filament and other reprap-related products.

Yes, because thinking about proof-of-stake for five minutes will show you how stupid it is from a long-term security standpoint.
