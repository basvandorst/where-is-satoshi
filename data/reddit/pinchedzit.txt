They can induce fear and panic just like they did over the weekend by dumping 15k btc at once on mt gox at below market value.
They got it from 134 to 126-128 doing this shit.  People don't believe that because they are stupid but that's one thing they are doing now.  If bitcoin had started the week at 134 it would have established much more confidence.
Whoever did this was very successful at putting bitcoin adoption back one week.
@_date: 2013-05-26 03:47:21
Buy 2 bitcoins for 274 instead of waiting around for something that will likely never pan out.  
Tell all the people you care about to get bitcoins and tell the rest it's not for them.
Best advice you'll get.

Bitcoin is manipulated.  Welcome to the world.
@_date: 2013-05-24 18:34:02
You're missing the point that it could be happening right now.  If they are smart enough to employ this tactic, they are smart enough to hire folks that know how to keep the prices down tremendously as they accumulate.
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:08:14
So your argument is that they are completely stupid and blind and would rather wait until it's a FAR more serious contender to fight it?
I don't get that.
@_date: 2013-05-28 03:01:19
I agree with that but the price went from 134 to 125 and back up to 128 because of this dickwad.  
We need some anti-dickwads.
The only people that do this stand to gain somewhere else.  Whoever these people are they are not gaining in money or btc so they must stand to gain a helluva lot from bitcoins failure.  Now who do you think that could be?
@_date: 2013-05-25 17:42:58
I just have one simple question with ripple and it's founding organization.  It's called "opencoin" so where the fuck is the source code.
Thought so...end of story.  Who the fuck knows what it's doing?  It's evil and NOT to be trusted.  I think I'll write an article explaining how for every XRP used, one more North Korean is put in a slave labor camp.  I mean you can't see the code so how do we know this isn't what happens?
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:02:18
Lol...the wall in this case is just the wall of buy and sell orders.  It sits on the wall...get it?

I'm starting to be cocky about it.  I'm telling those that think it's a scam just because it's new to stay the hell away from it, they are right.  Bitcoin doesn't want them.

In actuality it would take FAR, FAR less.  Far under 100 million as long as interest continues.
It would take 3 billion if EVERYONE dumped their coins and you'd be left holding them all at 300 dollars apiece.
@_date: 2013-05-25 21:13:50
I wish the mods of bitcoin would stop allowing ripple posts.  Go post in the Ripple subredit or did you guys name that bitcoinripple to ride on bitcoins coattails again?
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:12:07
I disagree.  You saw govts move because someone told them to.  
If they want the percentage of bitcoin activity to be more legal they should simply leave it alone and let it gain legitimacy quicker.
@_date: 2013-05-25 18:04:19
At least be honest and change the name of the organization to closedcoin.
What ripple really has behind it is big money marketing.  I'm sorry but 20% premined is just a bit too much...lmfao.
Closed source also means they can print as much XRP as they want.  So truthfully they have premined 99.999999999% of XRP.
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:47:53
Whatever price you sell at hits the wall that way.  People see it.  If it is lower than market value, it will be bought at the bids they place--higher.  It still sits on the wall to be seen by everyone...inducing panic.
There is no need to do that unless it is your intent to drop the price.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:40:32
Well yes you bought at that level, but I told several friends over the weekend about bitcoin.  I showed them the price was currently above 130.  
They saw the fall and didn't buy and are now afraid to buy.  Mission accomplished with just a 75k loss.
They will keep doing this.
We need a group that realizes they can make money by just buying when these a-holes do this and eating up their sells...imo.
I imagine it would only take a group with about 30-50 million to assure normal market fluctuations.
I could be wrong but I think it would be helpful.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:56:21
I hear you.  That argument is rendered absurd though when you consider the amount of cocaine, child porn, etc. that the US dollar purchases.
It appears to me we'd be better off ending the US dollar and moving to bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-27 23:44:08
Sorry guys...didn't explain.  No, this particular person dumped 15k btc at exact pricepoints all at once.  This would NOT be the best thing to do to actually make money.
Even if this is an attempt to lower the price to buy more, it didn't work in this case as the price stabilized higher than they dumped.
What this does do is spook wary investors and slow adoption.
@_date: 2013-05-27 04:37:34
Don't do it for bitcoin mining.  Bitcoin mining with GPUs is dead.  You could mine litecoins still with GPUs.

One last thing, I'm NOT spreading FUD.  I want this shit to stop.  I would like to know how we combat this but if you guys think we should just pretend it's not happening then I guess that's what the community is doing.  So be it.
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:18:47
I see through your intent.
I'm telling you new people were turned away from bitcoin because of manipulation.  You are telling me it's good for the current bitcoin community.
Are you saying bitcoin should be limited to the current community?  Does that even make sense?
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:36:39
If you don't understand what I've wrote, I really can't help you.  
It's just in my experience people like to make money and not lose 75k by selling below market value.
The only question is who does that.  I would say it likely is someone that stands to lose from bitcoin going up in value or maintaining stability.
@_date: 2013-05-25 04:00:13
Yes...sell all of them.  They are worthless.  Heck give them to me.
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:00:11
By the way, how the hell did you imagine your comment would be downvoted when that is just the common absurd position in the bitcoin community of denial?  Give me a break.
The ONLY other group I could see doing this are the big gold investors.  
Who else stands to lose from bitcoins existence folks?  "If you want to know who your enemies are, you look to see who it is that loses from your presence and benefits from your removal."
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:01:26
I know I like giving away 75k on a Memorial Monday.
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:34:01
That is a good argument.  Maybe he was being held by the Mexican Mafia and was going to have his head chopped off and couldn't wait an hour to not lose 75-100k.
@_date: 2013-05-28 16:17:07
Dude...I was watching the god damn buy and sell orders.  I saw it with my own two fucking eyes.  Now unless 20,000 people decided to post a god damn sell order of 7000 btc at 126 then your theory is wrong.
Go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:09:20
Uh huh.   Right.  You keep telling yourself that.
If it's my money I'm going to drop 200-300 here and there and fill up the gaps in the wall.
I'm not going to dump it 2-4 dollars below market value 7000 btc at once.

They could EASILY manipulate this market now with only 2 or 3 million to keep the prices low and bring prices down inducing panic sells.

There's a huge difference between those that think it might be a scam and those that want to simply spread FUD and listen to themselves talk.  Honestly, as the price goes up though and the volume increases.  Fuck them all if they are too dumb to get it.

Yes...a sell order below the current market value.  A large one that sits on the wall, is eaten up by all the buy orders higher and then stares at everyone in the face.
@_date: 2013-05-28 21:11:20
Too many dickheads to count.  No need to argue at this point.  If you worked in finance I'm sure you'd understand that no one in their right mind would drop 7k btc below market value just for grins and giggles.
You sir, have no idea what you're talking about.  
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:07:12
This happened.  I was there.  I saw it.  No one dumps 7k chunks of btc at a lower than market value just for the fuck of it.
This guy lost at least 75k.  If you saw the sell order you would understand.  It made ZERO sense.  
75k is VERY cheap to cause a week or two of fear and turn potential converts off.

@_date: 2013-05-28 18:24:46
A normal market fluctuation occurs when it is the goal to MAKE money unless you're retarded.  Now it could have been an attempt to bring the price down to buy more but if that was the case, there are far better ways.  
This is the only logical argument I'd possibly agree with but that would be the first time I had seen THAT technique. Bottom line, I just don't see how a reasonable trader would do that with 15k btc.
Now perhaps the person needed the money quickly but this seems absurd as well.  If you can't just spend an hour to not lose 75+k....I just don't know.
Maybe there's some retard with a lot of money that just likes fucking around?
@_date: 2013-05-28 21:09:39
Existing bitcoin users make money when the price goes up not when it plummets.  Also, there is a psychological tendency to jump into something on the way up.
I'm sure you understand this though.
@_date: 2013-05-28 21:24:37
I like how you corrected yourself at the end finally seeing what I'm saying.  Yes, you drip them over at "least" an hour.  Hell, I'm pretty sure only a billionaire might not wait 5 hours to avoid losing 75k.  So, you could extend that over many hours.  1 hour is still an exaggeration just to delineate the absurdity of what he did.
@_date: 2013-05-25 16:36:55
Basically when you have something that is hot...act like it.
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:15:21
You can put in a sell order at 126 and it appears on the wall that way.  It will get scooped up quicker at higher levels but the order is still there.  Everyone sees it.  It was for 126...7000btc.  This was done twice.  It took the price below 130 RAPIDLY and induced a lot of panic.
@_date: 2013-05-27 12:44:52
Wow...this is going to be a problem if bitcoin is ever worth 1 million a coin.
Can anyone say we need offline snapshots with hashes stored in the blockchain instead of the silly avoid micro transaction shit?
@_date: 2013-05-24 18:27:32
If a govt bought all the bitcons right now and the bitcoin community knew it was a direct attack, theoretically it would only take 51% of miners to acknowledge that and nullify the transactions--virtually impossible to do but nonetheless still a possibility.
Also, this is VERY unlikely as there are still going to be a large amount of people that hold their coins regardless.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:37:53
You are right as well.  They are attacking the exchanges with experienced traders as well though.  No one takes a 75k haircut just for the hell of it.

If you think they aren't shady, why even support bitcoin.  Clearly they have your best interest in mind.
@_date: 2013-05-24 18:37:03

134 to 125.  Tomorrow folks will look at that price and be a little less sure as to whether they want to try this bitcoin thing.
You're seeing manipulation by central bankers.  Bottom line.
They are the only ones that would want to lose 70k to slow down the adoption of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:43:59
I personally think direct attacks are bad for them.  Also, they can only do these market manipulations at key times without actually improving the exchange rate imo.  
For instance, if they've run through all their fuck-bitcoin btc then they have to buy more.  If they buy more all at once, the price would go up dramatically so they have to do it slowly on dips.
@_date: 2013-05-24 18:35:42
Now why you gonna hurt a fellow bitcoiners feelings throwing around words like retarded...and then adding supremely to it.  :'(
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:43:36
LMAO @ near infinite amounts of money.  You can't lose any more than 3 billion to keep bitcoin at 300 for years to come.
You do understand that currently there are only 11 some million bitcoins right?  New coins will be mined at a scheduled rate stopping at 21 million.   This is why the central bankers have to be real careful with their market manipulations.
@_date: 2013-05-25 03:55:11
There are a ton already.  Go start one of your own.  Call it heccoin.  See if you can get the world to pay attention.
@_date: 2013-05-26 21:13:02
Go to blockchain.info and type in the sent from public address and then the sent to public address and see if you see your transaction.
If it doesn't go through, it will just stay in the sent from address.  Sometimes it can take a bit.
So basically a transaction either succeeds or fails.  The worse thing you can do is send to an address that is not where you wanted to send to.  Nothing you can do about that.  Always double check the address before sending to it.
@_date: 2013-05-28 21:04:21
Well, since you believe the Federal Reserve doesn't engage in underhand activity, you should be fine with the US dollar.  No need to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:14:04

Friends...we're talking about non-investors.  Ordinary folks that hear all the shit talking about bitcoin.
It doesn't matter who it is.  The point is fear and panic was created to get it below 130.  
I think the bitcoin community needs to actively consider these things and try to come up with ways to counter some of these measures.

Maybe the regulation is actually meant to help...lmfao.  Yeah...that's what it's for.  It's absolutely imperative you register as a money exchanger in 50 states now.  Perhaps you should do it in every county as well or every city next.  It's real odd that you have to register in all 50 states when they all use the SAME MONEY.
The market manipulation where folks just throw away money...that's probably done by grandma and her investor club.
