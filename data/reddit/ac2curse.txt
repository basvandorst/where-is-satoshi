Because this is most likely a scam. There's a handful of fake accounts talking to each other and congratulating each other that are ~3-5 months old. A site that sends cash to your bank account well above market price? I'm not gonna lie it almost got me at first.

Really sorry to hear that, from these accounts posting it looks like it's a scam though. I hope for your sake I'm wrong.

I think we have a Cincy fan :)

This just might be the biggest thing that's ever happened for bitcoin. Those who aren't sports minded might not understand the resounding impact of this.

The point im trying to make is a large (UCF over 50k students) school and traditional powerhouse school (Clemson) could be in this bowl. Will it happen? Probably not. But there was a decent team (ECU) In the game last year. Thanks for the correction.

No, it's no confidential. I would assumed around half a million since it's not one of the more popular bowls. Some bowls are under 400k. The thing about the cheaper bowls is they don't make much money themselves, but obviously this exposure for bitcoin will be unlike anything it's ever experienced.

It would be amazing if they'd give out bitcoin for doing their searches instead of gift cards. Might be counter intuitive though.

Second place AAC? So if UCF goes undefeated until the end of the season and loses in conference and ends up here that's not a big deal? And yes, every program during December will mention something about the bowl game, even if only a prediction. No it's not the Orange bowl, but it's a big deal for Bitcoin.
edit: After rereading what I said, I misspoke. I don't mean it will be CONSTANTLY on in the sense of their will be a lot of talk and coverage specifically of this bowl game, but it will be constantly mentioned while talking about bowl predictions and the week this bowl will be played.
@_date: 2014-06-18 20:12:18
Even ignoring the fact that there are multiple North Carolina ACC teams, that would fit into the Belk bowl. And let's ignore the fact that you called Cincy the flagship school of the AAC after UCF just came off a BCS bowl victory. You're completely trying to ignore my argument that a team from a "powerhouse" conference of the ACC could play a school from the AAC with a very large fanbase/almuni. Stop trying to put words in my mouth. There is no prestige for either bowl game, but occasionally you get to see good teams in the St.Petersburg bowl.

Im not sure if this is an unfunny novelty account because absolutely no one said that and you're purposefully making a "wrong assumption". 
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:17:07
You're right, it's not the Rose bowl. You're right, it's not steeped in tradition, and it probably won't "capture the nation's attention". But you're wrong if you don't think this is big. I'm not going to predict what "impact" it's going to have, because it's hard to gauge and who means what when we say impact. This is a bowl game, and ESPN has a vested interest hyping up their bowls game they air no matter how minuscule. They will plaster this bowl game and it's logo all December, and discuss the teams that will play in it. The logo will be on the field, on the Jersey's and I'm sure they will do some sort of story about it. Then you have the teams. AAC vs the ACC. AAC trying to be the new power conference, and the ACC a tradition power conference. What if you get a matchup like UCF vs Clemson or UNC. That is a big deal. Those are very well established schools, with a very deep alumni base. I think it's easy to brush it off as a few old farts with a few drunk student watching a game no one cares about, and there's a chance it might be like that. Or there's a chance that there's two solid teams playing each other, with over a million national viewers thinking "hey look bitcoin is on tv it must be kind of legit". And I think that's the very least of what you'll get.

Thanks, first tip I've ever got :)
@_date: 2014-06-18 15:09:04
Not to mention, it will CONSTANTLY be on ESPN during the "bowl season". There will be graphs, and match up analysis all december, and although they primary talking point won't be this bowl game, it's logo is going to be thrown around all the time. Plus, you never know who is going to play in it. What if a team gets jipped that was headed to the playoffs but something happened and by the contract rules they are forced to play in the bitcoin bowl. There will be a lot of exposure if there's controversy. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:07:21
Yes. Its feasible you get a similar match up. Which is why you get UNC playing Cincy last year and Maryland playing Marshall in very similar bowl games. When Clemson is in a down year or two, its likely they could be in a position like this.

And you need to six forms of verification via social media. I don't have paypal, linkedin or facebook, nor will I get one to play on a site that hasn't proven itself better than any of the other bitcoin poker sites.
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:59:40
Is it a guarantee? How does this stop clone accounts besides making someone make more social media profiles? Honestly, if you know then I'd like to hear because maybe I just don't understand. Also, there's a clear issue with their algorithm when someone like me who can't get verified with three different social media sites. Obviously there will be faults, and no system is perfect but it's just to easy for someone like me to dismiss something like this when they aren't offering me anything other sites aren't (besides maybe their verification process which doesn't help me in this case).

I really hope they end up offering this 251 class as a MOOC. I take a lot of programming classes online in between semesters, and a class like this would be exactly what I've been looking for.

Doesn't seem to me he really understood how Tor worked fundamentally, but that never stops him for understanding general concepts and being able to speak broadly about things. That's just my interpretation though.
