Their spot price is inflated, they have a huge spread, THEN they add 2%.
Right now: Bitcoin spot price is AUD470. Coinjar says it is AUD480, and gives you a BUY of AUD485, and adds 2% for a total of AUD495, a AUD25 difference.
My issue isn't really the fees, it's the fact that they try and hide them. I hate that shit. I emailed them asking why their spot price was so much higher than the major exchanges and they told me that information was "proprietary".

What I  mean is, in all likelihood, the companies that design and build the chips and machines mine with them while they are profitable to mine with, and then sell them to the public once they're not. It would be stupid of them NOT to do this. This means that if you are buying miners from a supplier (as opposed to designing and building them in your own factory) then it's almost guaranteed to be a bad investment.

Went through the whole process of scanning my palm 4 times, taking my picture, scanning my ID... and then it said "OFFLINE TRY AGAIN".
Wtf. Went through the whole process again and it worked... but then made me wait 45 fucking minutes before it texted me that my account was activated.
While I was waiting I looked at the rate.. nearly 10% above spot price. Fucked if I'm gona wait 45 minutes while thing steals my fuckin identity to buy some overpriced coin.
Went to my bank and deposited some money in BTCmarkets.net and bought some in 10 minutes, at market rate +0.1%

Not really, if anyone is interested in reading a very concise and well-referenced guide to the scientific evidence behind the measurement of intelligence, you should check out [Ian Deary's Intelligence](
TL;DR: **The evidence strongly suggests that there is a single factor responsible for most of what we refer to as "intelligence". This manifests as a "processing speed" of sorts, where higher IQ individuals learn faster at whatever they attempt, making them perform better at it, and more quickly.**
"Multiple intelligences" is a myth.

Just don't entrust your private keys to other people. Services like these who print your PRIVATE KEY on whatever, should be AVOIDED, even if you use encrypted private keys. Your encryption will either be useless (brute forcible) or so convoluted that you void the whole purpose of having your private key printed in the first place.
