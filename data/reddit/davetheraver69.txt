I see, wonder why the second tx has not appeared, im guessing the platform of receiving wallet has a bug or problem?
and yes you are understanding correct

It says this when I generate new wallet
"For better privacy deposit each time to new bitcoin address. Once you deposit to address below a new bitcoin address will be generated for you. Old deposit addresses will still work."
So why did I only receive one TX?
Ill reward if anyone can help

Even if coinfloor got it mixed up I should still receive both TX in my wallet, only one is showing??

I see, would this be considered as a double spend and eventually be returned? I spoke to coinfloor and they said 
"As you can see, you have not lost any funds. Both withdrawals have been sent to the same address: 379cDpamgMaS4BYtiHF6FP5JA6LVmvM9AU"
I am really confused, the wallet the funds were sent to was a trading platform. I chose get new address to add funds to, and it gave a new address. But the wallet always stays the same address, its just gives you a separate new address to send to. Maybe this has cause the problem? And only one transaction is allowed for these wallets, maybe its a temporary wallet?
