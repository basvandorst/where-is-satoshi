The process was originally more for Apples benefit than it was for security.

Most apps rejected were more for duplicating existing functionality provided by Apple in the early days. They didn't want another store for apps or iTunes or really anything that Apple was competing directly with. You saw this with multiple popular things on Android and yet in the Apple ecosystem it was a huge gap. The most recent one that I can remember was the Google Maps fiasco where Apple had removed the default Maps in favor of Apple Maps but didn't approve the Google Maps version very quickly. 
I'm sure they claim and believe that it somehow catches security related issues but it falls short of it by far. Without a full code review Apple wouldn't catch most apps that are security concerns. Funny enough apps like the paint or something, it was a pointless app but if you knew some secret combo it would enable a tethering option where the data wasn't tagged as tethered data so you could use the unlimited plan without a tethering option. They missed it by a mile and then later revoked the app.
Tldr: It's not a security review they do, it's just a walled garden of features that Apple allows. No more secure than other mobile stores IMO.

You can also say the same for any currency as well. Physical money is easily lost or destroyed. When do you say it's destroyed or lost and reprint it? Maybe it's in a safe somewhere collecting dust just being held onto for some reason. Can't get too worried about lost currency. It happens to all forms.

And yet it could have also been absolutely worthless. It was a gamble and you (and I) didn't buy into it, such is our life. We didn't accept the risk and we also don't get the gain from the gamble.

Eventually if people are using Bitcoin as currency instead on just exchanging at both ends wouldn't it become very difficult to track? I suppose it would require cooperation of at least one party for a government to glean information that is of value.

I bought in at 5880, I'm quite pleased. I've missed opportunities before and now I'm much much less worried about hitting the most optimal price point. I _could_ try and maximize my gains but it can easily be at the cost of missing the window. Now I just buy whenever, but always buy when it dips.

Solid investment strategy. Let's see how this works in the long game.

Was the plan to take it around the balcony or something? I can't fathom the plan was to drop it!

Literally lit that money on fire previously.

Probably because of a $14.67 dispute. Better freeze that account!

Easy answer, I don't!

Might as well be expired. There's been ample notification and time to deal with that. This isn't new.
