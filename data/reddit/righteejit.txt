Surely though the eventual goal is for someone to be able to set up a wallet, get paid in crypto,  and use that to buy goods and services, without needing to understand the underlying technology?

Who the fuck would be dumb enough to keep 400 million in a single bank without any protection? 
Also how often do banks go down?
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:28:59
Also shop around for banks for fucks sake. Find the bank offering the best deal for the income and spending levels you have.

I see a lot of anti-bank sentiment on here but what about the protections and guarantees they can provide? I've seen plenty people saying company X won't give them the money for the crypto they sold. Also what about credit?

Okay so I'm really new to all of this, but is it really any different to investing in gold?
Gold is finite, the buying and selling of it changes the price daily etc etc. You don't ever physically own said gold but you trade it. 
If this is an accurate comparison, then why is it so hard for these people to grasp?

Yep I checked it yesterday and was disappointed to see -6% on GDP/BTC
Then I changed it to weekly and remembered that it's still overall doing amazingly

Hoo boy, with crackpot comments like that I sure hope you keep plenty of tinfoil at home.
But just for the record, The Guardian along with the other publications they own are owned by The Scott Trust and funded by reader donations.

That's the advice I took at the start and I'm glad I suck to it. Sure if it moons I won't be getting a lambo, but I won't miss that £200 of my savings 
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:33:03
Lol what
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:00:09
Because it's generally good quality journalism and not tabloid garbage or owned by Murdoch?
@_date: 2018-06-06 19:49:20
Eh I don't really. They clearly support the Labour party here, but I personally don't. I do agree it's more left leaning but I respect them for being the only paper here who published the Panama papers

Yeah he literally got fired from the party of racists for being too racist.
Amazing how far people on this subreddit will bend to find anything that supports their anti banking view.
