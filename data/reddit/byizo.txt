I took some out a few weeks ago. Since bitcoin reached 10k it’s been acting more like a stock, following chart trends and such. Traditionally two high peaks (19k+) followed by a drop is a sign the stock is likely to continue falling. I got somewhat lucky based on that guess.

I mean.. by definition if you were to *buy*  affection you would need money. Unless the affection-giver accepts some sort of alternate trade.

That’s how I view my cold storage BTC. It’s either going to be enough to retire and live debt free or it will be worthless. I have a number in mind.

Start? They've been doing it for as long as I can remember for accounts that don't have much money in them. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:55:49
That's why I didn't sell all of it because I couldn't be sure. That way I came out pretty well whether BTC bounced back or kept falling. Hodling through thick and thin has historically paid out in a big way for BTC, but I wanted to use at least some of what I have as a trading tool. So far I've come out ahead by a little, but have certainly read things wrong and lost several times.

@_date: 2018-01-22 15:32:47
I sold some of what I had when the value came down after the second $19k "spike" expecting it to continue falling. I'm still way up on the rest of what I own. 
Before selling I was looking at the price 50x/day, agonizing over it. Now I might look at it once a day if that, and I wouldn't stress out about it regardless.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:39:09
BTC being as volatile and unpredictable as it is HODLing is the best way, historically, to make money on Bitcoin. That is assuming you are not simply waiting for BTC to overtake fiat as a means of trade.
With most assets I would have a point at which I would get out, but it's flexible depending on trends, trading volume, etc. Sometimes I get it right and sometimes not, but overall I'm making money. BTC however is one thing I plan to keep for the most part, at least until I am confident I can live the rest of my life on the dollar value of my crypto. I've done some buying and selling trying to hit close to the peaks and valleys recently, but overall it's been mostly a wash.

A lot of people have told themselves that only to see their stock/crypto become untradeable.
Not saying I believe that will happen to Bitcoin, only that the mantra lulls people into a false sense of safety over falling stock prices.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:55:13
I would imagine futures would be expensive for BTC considering the price can change 20% or more in an hour and recover/correct in the next hour. Having one for more than a 48 hour period would suck because you would hardly want to blink much less sleep.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:25
Problem is you don’t know when it’s going to dip. You could sell now and the price could climb to 25k and drop to 18k. If I could be at all confident that a drop would happen soon I’d sell what I have, use it to buy an insane contract to short bitcoin, buy the dip, sell then contract amount for my previous selling point, and then buy three times as much as I had at the high.
But that’s the equivalent of putting all your money on a roulette wheel, winning, letting it ride, and winning again.
What good investors do is sell *some* when they expect a dip, then re-evaluate as the price changes.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:02:00
But what happens when those businesses receive bitcoin as payment? They sell it for dollars/euros/yen/etc. the real key is for businesses to accept AND make purchases/payments with bitcoin, and there isn’t enough stability in the price yet for that. No one is going to run a business when their liquid assets are likely to drop 20% in an hour.

I don’t know if a 20% drop less than 24 hours after a 50% climb counts as a dip.

Just buy and throw away your seed words and private key. Then you'll never worry about selling your bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:21:08
I'd say it wouldn't be mainstream until it gets around 1% of global market share, meaning it would be well over $200k/BTC without adjusting for the inflation of USD.

It took me all of about an hour of learning about cryptocurrencies to decide a paper wallet option was best for me. 2 secure, separate storage locations for seed words/private keys. They're as safe as anything else I own. Even more so because even if one gets stolen I can use the copy to send it elsewhere before the thief figures out what they have.
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:02:51
Multiple, laminated copies kept in separate, secure locations that only you know about. Even if one is stolen so long as I know about it the thief would need to be able to recognize what the information is and how to use it before I had a chance to move my Crypto to another secure wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:19:03
Hell, I've talked with my coworkers about it, including guys my age and none of them had even heard of cryptocurrency before.
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:00:06
It's the planting a tree philosophy. The problem is even if you bought thousands of bitcoin back in 2010 you'd be hard pressed not to have sold during the decline in 2014 when the bitcoin performed worse in the market than the Russian Ruble. Then you'd be kicking yourself today for not holding on to it. We all make the best financial decisions with the information we had at the time. We all lament over missed opportunities/lost keys/etc. but there's nothing we can do to change it. We can only use it to make better decisions now.
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:54:18
The thing is that bitcoin only makes up some .02% of the total market now, so it's not even a blip on the radar yet. By the time the global market recognizes bitcoin as some type of threat we'll be looking at a BTC worth tens or hundreds of thousands of USD.
@_date: 2017-08-31 02:14:45
Bitcoin is mainly a digital asset. You can't really even call it a currency yet because even when a vendor accepts bitcoin they just exchange it back to dollars/euros/etc. They don't keep it in bitcoin and pay their employees in bitcoin. Also the price is very volatile compared to most currencies. Even if you paid employees in BTC you could have hired someone at .025btc/hr back when that was reasonable and be paying them a fortune within a few years. The main reason those who have gotten into it this late is because they believe they can make money waiting to sell it until later. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:56:10
I looked at it at around 1am eastern time and was like, "Buy the dip!"
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:49:23
And that's still only a fraction of a percent.
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:41:39
The only thing a dip would do is allow me to buy more, so the question is do I continue to purchase my same, set amount this week or wait until next week hoping for a correction and be able to buy a bit more. I'm not in the business of buying and selling. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:46:12
Buy $50 at (a little over 1 year ago) $400/BTC just as an example, meaning she would have had .125 BTC.
If the average of what she spent was at $2000/BTC (entirely possible) she would have spent .011 BTC leaving her with .104
That .104 at $4400 (current peak) would be $457.60.
$520 is a bit more than that, so maybe most of the $42 was spend later, meaning her bitcoin was worth more in terms of dollars. Anyhow it's entirely possible depending on how long she sat on it before spending any.
Edit: Just to make a point, in the extreme case she could have gotten it 2 years ago and had ~.25 BTC and not spent any of it until just recently (~$3500/BTC) leaving her with .238 BTC which would be $1047.20 at $4400/BTC.

Solution: Starve to death to buy bitcoin.

From my (admittedly limited) understanding the address is where your BTC is stored, the public key is used to track transactions(?) and the private key is what you use to authorize moving BTC from one address to another. Without the private key you can't authorize to move your bitcoin and it is therefore completely worthless. The safest way IMO is to make a wallet using a strictly offline device, write down your information and keep 2 copies in 2 different locations in 2 different safes. That way if one gets burned, water damaged, lost, stolen, etc. you have a backup.

Thing is he was never charged for the hits. I think it had something to do with the fact they couldn’t prove any of them had ever occurred, but they still used it against his character in court.

A: don’t use borrowed money to make an investment. It changes your mentality and makes you more likely to panic and lose money. 
B: bitcoin is a gamble. You wouldn’t take out a loan and put all of it on Black in a roulette table, so why would you take out a loan and put it in bitcoin?
When you use money you can stand to lose it makes weathering the dips seem like nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:43:29
That was the most risky time to have it though. Bitcoin was much more likely to become untradeable early on than it is now. 
Not to mention if you had it you'd probably sold at $1 or $8 or $30 per Bitcoin because you would still be thinking it would likely crash. Just about the only way you would have held on this long is to have misplaced your key/seed and just have recently found it.

The Case File podcast does a pretty good 3 part series on The Silk Road. While the sentence is absurd the US court felt it had to make a statement due to the unprecedented situation at managing a site to sell illegal goods and use the US mail to traffic them. Ross was just the unfortunate pioneer of that case. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:39:49
That's not even the core issue. What has to happen for Bitcoin to be accepted as a true form of money is for businesses to say, "We will keep all of our liquid assets in Bitcoin, we will make all payments in Bitcoin, and we will pay our employees in Bitcoin." Right now it is too volatile for that to happen. Even the businesses that accept BTC as a form of payment simply sell it for their local currency.

An easy way to remember not to panic sell is to remember bitcoin is never “down”. It’s either up or it’s on sale.

Every investment you make, regardless of how much you make/lose, could have been done better. People selling now will probably wish they had held on another year or so.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:54:03
I bought during both of the last dips. $3600 then again at $5600. Problem is I could have bought in the $4000s but awaited for another dip. Price kept rising until $5600 looked like a discount. Don’t sweat it and just buy now because if it hits $10k and only dips to $8500 you’ll be wishing you’d have bought now.
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:22:58
With that frame of mind there is no not regretting. 
"I could have bought BTC at $.08."
"I could have not sold at $8."
"I could have bought at $200."
"I could have sold at $1000."
"I could have bought again at $180."
"I could have sold at $18k and rebought at $7k."
"I could have invested in Nerf, Apple, Disney, Nike, Google, Amazon, etc. etc."
We all make the best financial decisions we can with the money and information we have now. There are likely a hundred investments you can make today that will pay out much better than whatever will happen to bitcoin in the next year, but unless you can tell the future we just don't know.
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:24:01
Bought at $3900, $4300, and $3600 recently. The price fluctuations are fun to watch, but I what concerns me is where bitcoin will be 20 years from now. The day-to-day isn't significant unless you are counting on the money you put into bitcoin to pay bills. Hodl til I die or can retire on my BTC.

My only regret is not having more money for BTC now.
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:35:43
I didn't invest in Apple/Amazon/Google/etc. when they were at their lows because I didn't have the money to spare and because for all I knew at the time, they would fail.
I knew about bitcoin when it was around $200/BTC. Thought about buying it but figured $200 was way too much. When it fell in 2014 I thought "I made the right decision". Feels like I blinked and it was at $2k. 
Going into debt to invest in anything is a risky move. What if it fails? What if you have to make payments and pay interest on money that got you absolutely nothing? You'd be far worse off than you are now. Better not to worry about it. There are probably dozens of things you could invest a modest amount in today that would make you a millionaire in the next 10-20 years, but no-one can be sure what they are.

Bitcoin and gold are fundamentally different. 
Bitcoin is extremely volatile in its value, while gold holds it's value.
For example let's say one ounce of gold will keep me afloat for one month (rent, utilities, food, etc.). This should remain as true today as it was decades ago and for decades to come. One ounce is tradable for the same goods and services regardless of what happens to our fiat currency.
Bitcoin on the other hand is a gamble. I have no idea whether I'll be able to buy a Maserati, a private jet, or a week's worth of groceries with my BTC even a year from now. The fact that you can buy many times as much as what you could have with the same bitcoin from even a year ago shows that. 
BTC is NOT a good store of value. That doesn't mean it's not valuable or that it isn't a good form of currency, just that its buying power is not stable (currently). Bitcoin is not better than gold. Gold is not better than bitcoin. They are both completely different things.
