Not all of us are here to learn, at least not in the way I believe you are thinking. Some of us are here to *teach*, many of us are here to innovate, and many more are doing research in the very area  represents. Yet  works just fine. WTF?

Yes, an institution that is supposed to be innovating, cutting edge, and a proponent of free speech... meanwhile MIT publicly defends its own students in a bitcoin related case.

Excited to try you guys out. The site seems like it needs some work yet. The /my-account-2 page yields a redirect loop error (chrome /android 4.4) and I got an invalid certificate error referencing a wpengine.com site when I created an account.

I have not had much luck with them. Had one $50 order complete, but then multiple attempts failed with buyers cancelling orders. Purse.io customer service was good, though, and they've been working on the buyer issue. Maybe worth another shot?

I would love something like this. I think the biggest practical obstacle is shielding participating wifi operators from liability due to the actions of their anonymous customers. Every ISP TOS out there clearly leaves the account holder liable for violations, E. G. Dmca

Same here. They've asked me to reverify after "losing" their original documents (the new verification process uses your webcam or phone to upload a fresh selfie). And then support claims it should be all good... And then deposit attempts continue to fail.
