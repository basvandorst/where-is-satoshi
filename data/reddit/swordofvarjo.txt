He's being downvoted for sounding like a moron.
I mean cmon, asking what kind of returns he can expect from $40 and then claiming he might invest up to 100k at some point? Anyone who's done ANY investing (talking amounts in the 3+ figures) knows how to google a damn price chart. What kind of investment do you think you'll make on $40 because it's likely as good a guess as anyone else's.
OP: If you  actually have the financial ability to invest 100k in something, just buy 0.5 BTC, stick it in a wallet, and forget you own it for like a decade. Then come back and see what's happened. You don't sound like a sophisticated enough investor for anything else. As for the rest of your money (roughly 95k), throw it in a low cost index fund comprised of ETFs (Betterment is noob friendly and a good place to start).

I'm sorry, what? The US political system has a lot of issues, but it's not authoritarian, not even remotely close.

Honestly, you have far more to worry about from a pc than paper. If you print your keys on archival grade paper and put it in something like a safety deposit box, you're pretty set. With your computer you have to worry about magnetic interference or hdd failure to do vibrations/moving the thing.
Also, if your pc has an ssd, not an hdd, you need to back up your wallet ASAP, SSDs do not retain data indefinitely.

Please please please don't hand over your debit card anywhere. Don't use the thing except in the most trusted of ATMs. Credit cards are far safer than debit; it's very hard to be on the hook for stolen funds with a credit card where as it's not that difficult for it to happen with a debit card. Side bonus, you can be getting 2 percent cashbacks on everything with a cc.

The bigger issue is the legal framework regulating each one.
Credit cards, in the US, fall under the Fair Credit Billing Act, which is very strong and limits you, by law, to no more than $50 in liability.
Debit cards fall under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and have much tighter requirements about reporting. If you don't notice fraud until 2 or more days later, you could legally be on the hook for $500. If you're too slow, you could legally owe all of it.
Again, it's not about policy, but about the underlying laws protecting you.

It's in general, I'm not very familiar with exactly how cashapp works. For a great 2 percent no-fee CC, I'm a big fan of the citi doublecash.
I'm not saying you WILL have an issue using debit, but it is less ironclad in its safety than a credit card where it's almost impossible to lose money due to fraud (you'd have to not notice for months and violate the "report in a timely manner" clause).

Sanity check post:
$20 in 1998 is $31 in today's dollars.

Sure... because I quoted inflation rate across the entire US, not cost of living in Boston.

I think this is decent advice. 10 percent is reasonable assuming the rest of your money is in more stable and conventional investments. I highly recommend low fee vanguard target date funds (ETF packages essentially) as retirement vehicles.

This is still wrong. $20 in 1998 is roughly $31 in 2019 dollars. That means your full cart now would be roughly $160.
