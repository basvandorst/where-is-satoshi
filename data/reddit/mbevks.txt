It would be great if he could use the bitcoin to buy computer parts.

tl;dr High-income dude had some cash flow issues and now banks won't give him an account despite his having a lot of cash.

Is this why my software gave me this message today-- "Your node software is out of date and may accept an invalid bitcoin fork."

I love Bitcoin but this feels like a bubble. Are there any signs of Bitcoin being used as actual currency in mainstream transactions in Cyprus or other nations?

"Bitcoin is to be investigated by both the FBI and DHS" -- Good luck finding their office!

It'll stabilize when major retailers begin to accept bitcoin. They sooner that happens, the sooner price stability.

If it gets to $1000, I'm selling everything and waiting for it to get back down to buy again. At $1000 you are looking at a serious bubble.

Oh, trust me, I am very pro-bitcoin. I think having the ability to short bitcoin would add to liquidity and actually help it be seem more legit.

Good point but even in most domestic commercial transactions, the value of such transaction is relatively small compared to a $1000 per bitcoin transaction.

Whoever sent all the bitcoin -- thanks!

So if someone had a bank account in Japan and another one in the US, they could efficiently buy bitcoin elsewhere, sell on MtGox, deposit in Japan bank acccount, convert to dollars, and wire to the US? Am I missing something or are others already doing this?

I'm comfortable with a bitcoin price of $7. I might buy at $3. There was no logical reason for the price to be as high as it was. Glad I avoided the rush in.

Or better yet, give a generous cash tip and throw some bitcoins on top of it. Perhaps someone will create a good Q&amp;A to leave for the wait staff on how to use bitcoin and how it is not a scam.

From what I understand, a very large percentage of the TOR servers may be run by the government. If this is the case, they can triangulate very effectively.

I might base how much I pay for a Hertz Rent-A-Car stock based on fuel price, airport travel, pricing on bulk purchases of cars, bond rates/terms, the business success of their larger corporate customers, innovation, &amp; pricing against competition. With bitcoin, most of these metrics are unavailable.

Also, the value of a currency rarely comes from force. Rather, it comes from social convention. That is why the Somali Shilling was still a common currency for a decade with no government despite being completely fiat and despite the governing authority failing. Source:

If someone invented bitcoin bills (paper money bitcoin), that would be awesome.

I'm hopeful for the future of bitcoin. If you aren't, feel free to donate your "worthless" coins to me:

I wish nobody would do recreational drugs but I sure would rather someone buy them online and use them in their home out of public eye than to have drug dealers setting up drug houses and corner drug dealers. I don't think the government should make all this legal but I do wish they would *tolerate* it for the public good.

Entrusting bitcoin to facebook is like entrusting weight loss programs to walmart customers. Sure, they are free to be in that market, and maybe they make a little money off of it, but it really just becomes another excuse to make fun of them.
