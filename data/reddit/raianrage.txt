But companies in the telecomm industry make deals with each other so they can ignore competition and they all drive prices up. So... his idea doesn't work

Thanks for the link, I'll check that out.

Thank you, this comment provides actual food for thought. Then again, I have other issues with an utter lack of government involvement that fall more or less along the lines of r/conspiracy, so I won't post them here.

It would be difficult to individually track things down in the block chain, perhaps. However, the rise of block chain tech will lead to supplemental advances in technology. Someone, somewhere, will invent a Block Chain Tracker that takes the hard work out of it for ya.

I hope more towns do so, but I hadn't heard of this so I'll have to look in to it. Also, all I'm getting from lobbying being ineffective is that they wouldn't even need to lobby to become tyrannical entities in a free market system. Then again, I don't think humanity has ever seen a true free market, so who knows?

Doesn't seem to stop them.

Perhaps, but your idea brings up two questions for me: Firstly, how is a startup/small telecomm company going to be able to compete and survive against giants that can lower prices to crush them without batting an eye? Secondly, without government restrictions on big business, big business will be able to lobby even more, thus further contaminating our political process in order to get their way and deny us what we (as consumers) desire. Then we would be right back at square monopoly.
