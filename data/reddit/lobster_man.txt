Tweet malleability damn near cost me all 140 characters and my entire history too! :(

Something else to consider...the more people who ignore or only very loosely adhere to these rules and force the IRS to actually work to find every "lost cent" that they are not getting (not able to steal from the citizens), the less people overall they will be able to target and prosecute; their resources are very limited these days and even among other feds they are not very popular due to recent scandals ;)

Using ebay to sell bitcoins is just about the equivalent of using craigslist...sometimes it works but it's very risky. Not that I am suggesting that one should use paypal to buy/sell bitcoins, but it is possible and a bit safer if you use a site like  to conduct business
@_date: 2014-05-15 00:53:11
I think for most small/personal transactions using bitcoin-otc or even something local, that most people would not bother to even follow this (and if it's not a huge transaction, that may be a safe course of action...)
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:46:25
Basically, yes
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:35:58
I'm pretty sure  has all of that stuff, and while it may not be admissible in court, it's probably a correct and mostly complete history of the gox-tweets

Always keep control of your coins :(

Not only that but mtgox had proven themselves to be largely incompetent since 2011 and even earlier... The writing was on the wall too...
I personally used mtgox, for a time...in 2010-2012. I got spooked in 2012 and took all my coins out back then and never used mtgox again; not to rub salt in peoples' wounds but I am damn glad I went with my gut way back then

I still use my old GTX275s to mine too, but I don't really expect to earn much/anything and only really mine anymore during the winter :)

I believe this is against valve policy anyway...good way to get one or both peoples' steam accounts banned
@_date: 2012-01-30 11:05:01
I kind of like this idea... 
Would it be impossible to just make this a text value displayed somewhere on the right side, say, in or near the subreddit description?
@_date: 2011-10-24 06:19:33
This doesn't show that the price peaked around 30?
@_date: 2011-02-14 00:07:05
While this is kind of a spammy post....censorship is not cool either :|
@_date: 2011-02-11 06:40:40
is this link broken?
@_date: 2011-03-27 02:28:05
The official distributed version of bitcoin comes with that dll, it resides in the base directory of the zip archive:

Mtgox is doing some shady stuff or is broken again, the high was never 12
@_date: 2011-09-16 18:45:38
Yes...you're correct, I forgot the difficulty factor in this...never mind my previous statement :)
@_date: 2011-09-13 13:37:38
I don't use namecoin, how long until block 19100 or has this already happened?

SA has gone very much downhill in recent years and the community doesn't really have the clout/influence that it used to
@_date: 2011-10-24 06:19:15
I was just noticing that :)
@_date: 2011-05-12 03:36:22
I suspect a lot of this recent cost increase is due to large scale speculative buying.
The price jumps a lot at one time and then slowly falls back down until more large scale orders are placed and it will jump back up again; it almost seems like some unknown 3rd party is attempting to prop the value up.
@_date: 2011-05-12 03:27:52
(I'm assuming you're using windows?)
I wrote up a guide a while back that has some troubleshooting information towards the bottom, you may find it useful:
@_date: 2011-02-24 21:06:24
If you have moderate hardware you can still make some money if you use one of the pools. I have 2 nvidia gtx275's in sli that I use for mining, and while the difficulty is very high these days, I still make several bitcoins/daily with the pool. The time has kind of passed where you can realistically expect to generate your own blocks with low to midrange hardware, but there is still some money to be made in the pools.
Also, the price is so volatile, if you are patient and dedicated, you can actually do pretty well just buying/selling bitcoins too
@_date: 2011-03-27 00:11:13
I posted another guide for this a few months back (also linked in the article :P)

I'd be careful...an error doesn't necessarily indicate a failure but may be the malware doing some sort of code injection into running processes

I think the biggest issue is that he made a not-entirely-trivial amount of money from his endeavors, grey-area as they may be. The feds tend to only really take a serious interest in stuff that is ostensibly illegal when people start profiting from it

I have not had luck with them either... I made an account and tried to get verified, but they cancelled my $1.99 order or whatever and answered my first support ticket quickly... (this was back in sept.)
But their answer wasn't really helpful so I submitted another ticket and they have yet to respond to me... so I don't know what's up. I see I am not the only one having problems too...
I really hope this isn't a scam site to steal identities/CC or something, or else I will feel really stupid :(
@_date: 2013-10-07 03:28:37
If BFL were shipping any actual product you may be right. But as of now they are just as good as a scam and take peoples' money and don't deliver anything.
@_date: 2013-10-27 09:09:33
If you paid outside of ebay/paypal with btc there is probably nothing that can be done
@_date: 2013-06-07 02:22:00
that's not...photoshopped at all....
@_date: 2013-10-10 05:28:14
Any idea what is going on? I've been trying to contact them to get my account verified for almost a month now, and they have stopped responding. I tried to submit my CC# and ID but they cancelled the transaction and will not reply to my inquiries...
@_date: 2013-10-25 07:36:32
But an important point to consider (no matter how secure or reputable any service seems)....if you don't have the data in your possession...you might not be the only one to "own" it........

interesting.... that in and of itself shouldn't be enough to call the site a scam or not, because as ive heard...people did have success using it in past months...

I think this is what that graph looks like on a linear scale (see the right scale and the red line)
@_date: 2013-08-05 03:12:29
That is some scary looking javascript...I wonder if it was all hand-written or was run through some sort of obfuscation engine
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:25:46
That is one of the speculations I had...someone running some businesses trying to pay the least amount of taxes they can get away with...

4...or 5? I thought bitcoin was released in jan-2009 == 4 years?
@_date: 2013-04-06 02:25:09
It looks like this is a stolen youtube account with a bunch of other stolen accounts used to comment and give it a thumbs up. Some of the other recent videos are "generators" that you "need to get a secret code for"
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:07:38
The scale on the right is a logarithmic/"decade" scale that shows the price of bitcoins relative to usd. This is scaled heavily towards the lower tiers, ex 1-10,000, but the jump from there to 100mil is huge, even though the vertical spacing looks similar. (note that 'halfway' down the scale is 10,000)
the graph I made however is a linear scale, that shows the equally-spaced values, and the "middle" or halfway-point of this scale is 500,000,000
@_date: 2013-06-07 02:27:14
I think you over-rated paypal a bit :P
@_date: 2013-09-14 11:08:43
How does this work, did they actually ship you your real order, as in the working device? Or did they just toss some rocks into a box and give you that?
@_date: 2013-03-18 02:57:26
What if most of these orders are placed as "dummy orders", to inflate order books and with the knowledge they will not ever be filled, but are just trying to create the illusion of huge demand?
Perhaps a bit of a skeptical outlook...

I did not write this...some random person joined the r/conspiracy IRC channel on freenode ( and posted this message:
    &lt;wtfever&gt; Hi. I don't have the ability to post to nor do I want it, but I went out on a whim by myself when something didn't smell right poking around a major Bitcoin site and ended up finding a little trail of evidence that is almost surreal. I like the board, so if anyone is interested in what I dug up, feel free to post it: 
I'm not really sure what to make of it, but I find it interesting, and think this should be made available for others to see and draw their own conclusion. It seems that a lot of research has been done, and there are some interesting similarities which exist...
This could be nothing but complete disinfo (since it seems to push an agenda that is anti-blockchain.info; the info presented could just be typical SEO or other business obfuscation to try to avoid taxes etc), but it is here for those who are interested in reading it
