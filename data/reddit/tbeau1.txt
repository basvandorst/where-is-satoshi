It could be possible due to automatic trading programs that trade based off of headlines.

Their bad security practices eliminated any chance at a timely recovery following the 2011 crash (these issues were fixed and the company has changed ownership since then)... still some bad blood though.
Also, lag on their servers triggered the early 2013 crash. They've also fixed this issue.
The US government hijacked a bunch of their funds, since then rumors have spread about their solvency. Fueling these rumors is increased difficulty for Americans to withdraw cash from their service.

In a recession, demand for products decrease... and the masses tend to focus more on paying down debt.

Bitcoin is actually two different things. One part of it is a currency... Which is worthless without the programming that governs it. But the second part, which is far more significant, is the payment processing network. Miners compete to process blocks of transactions... Roughly every ten minutes. Most transactions include a small transaction fee which is also rewarded to the miners (transaction fees is what they will compete for after all the bitcoins are mined). Without blocks, transactions can't get verified.

As long as new Bitcoins are being added to it's economy, it is technically inflationary. Currently 3600 BTC generate every day. And at the current price of $135, they're worth about $486,000. So as long as demand continues to exceed that number, Bitcoin will behave like it's experiencing deflation.

Inflation has no direct effect on the market cap, only the price*. So assuming no inflation since April, but the same market cap, that would mean the price would be the same as April.
*although rapid price fluctuations (caused by inflation or otherwise) can further affect the price which, in turn, affects the market cap.

Unless you know something I don't, I don't believe QE is already tapering. And if Yellen is appointed as the new Fed Chair, I would expect QE to increase.
Because most of the QE is just sitting in reserves, I don't assume it would have an immediate drag on the dollar. It is once banks start lending again and this new $3+ trillion gets fractionally reserved into almost $300 trillion when it will drag. The small amounts of QE that is currently escaping into the economy is only making up for deleveraging happening throughout the economy.


Yes, we are seeing this to a small degree in Argentina now.


I do agree with this... but to anyone, like me, who believes there are strong financial storms ahead - bitcoin is likely too high risk (due to being such a small and easily-influenced economy) to be your only store of wealth.

These large figures are from measuring Bitcoin compared to various monetary bases, GDPs, or market caps... there are disagreements over whether measuring against these figures would provide an accurate price expectation for Bitcoin.
What IS obvious is that Bitcoin's value grows as it becomes more adopted. Yet, at this point, it is still an extremely small economy (doesn't even make up 0.01% of global transactions). Most of us believe it has far greater potential than where we're at now... which would signify that it has plenty of room for further adoption (and thus more growth in value).

Considering only 3600 bitcoins are mined each day, even if they were all instantly sold in exchanges, the recent demand greatly overwhelms such a small number. Therefore, I would say mining has little affect on present value.

The block chain is a ledger of all bitcoin transactions, ever. Currently, every new block generated starts off with a transaction that generates 25 newly created coins and issues them to the miner that discovered the block (this 25 figure is cut in half every four years until there's ultimately 21 million bitcoins - then no new coins are generated). Following the newly created coins, the block lists all other transactions in the network que waiting to be verified. So a block is just an addition to the ledger.
As long as there's still newly created coins with each block, there can be a reward without transaction fees. But the idea is that by the time we hit the maximum amount of bitcoins, there'd be enough transactions to collect a sizeable reward miners.
To me, bitcoin is superior to credit card transactions because it doesn't require a direct 3rd party - transactions are similar to cash. Plus, credit cards represent debt... where bitcoins represent an actual balance (I can't spend what I don't have). Credit cards charge merchants 3% a transaction, bitcoin transaction fees are typically only a fraction of a percent to the consumer.
Bitcoins, being a digital thing, don't have any physical intrinsic value like say gold does... but do you find value in the services a banks or credit card companies provide? Can a 'service' be considered intrinsic? Bitcoin has such services built into it (and more services built into it that are still being developed such as escrow, contracts, wills, etc).

Maybe not Bitcoin itself, but crypto-currencies in general, as a new technological advancement.

By default, most current wallet programs add a 0.0005 BTC transaction fee to all transactions. This fee is currently voluntary, but it works as incentive for miners to process your transaction. At this time, including the fee will likely get your transaction processed in a few minutes as opposed to a few hours.
@_date: 2013-03-26 03:22:56
Not necessarily ... taxes would probably just be collected at the sales tax level. Of course, if the government is collecting and using bitcoins, they'll be self destructive unless they can keep a balanced budget.

Usually payment is received nearly instantly - but it can depend on how well connected each party is to the overall network.
Now if the receiver is concerned about double-spend attempts (which is rare), they can up to 10 minutes for the transaction to appear on the next block... OR wait until they've received 6 confirmations.
There's no way to cancel a transaction.

MtGox has a lot more liquidity, but by the time you get your money over there (or to any other exchange) the price could be at $160... and if you don't already have a verified account at MtGox, then it could take a great deal longer. So, I'd say just take what you can get at BitFloor.
I actually like BitFloor because of the ease of getting money into it - which is probably why they don't have a lot of liquidity.
I would highly advise staying away from day trading Bitcoin, at least at this point. It's economy is still very small and can be easily influenced by folks with deep pockets, one way or the other.

As you can see, some people get extremely paranoid about bitcoin wallet theft. It really comes down to how you use your computer.

In that way, it's a lot like a cash transaction. It may not be as friendly to shoppers, but it does help vendors from getting scammed with charge-backs. Vendors also still have motivation to not rip off their shoppers because they don't want to earn a bad reputation.

As pathetic as governments have been at prohibiting drugs and alcohol, there is no reason to fear any such prohibition of bitcoin. How much harder would it be to seize something that's non-physical.
Most people here already understand that because bitcoin is still such a small economy, and because it is so small it is risky. Corporation understand that risk, which is why they've been slow to move. Competitive advantage will eventually bring them in.

The thing is, you can't have major adoption without instability... the bitcoin price is reflective of the adoption rate.
Perhaps when it's market cap is equal to much larger currencies, then it will seem more stable. But as long as we're comparing this deflationary currency to heavily inflation currencies, I doubt it.

I would suggest holding onto a good portion of them (be sure to secure them well)... But also diversify by buying other assets with them (there are a couple places you can buy gold and silver with bitcoin for example). Then if you need some immediate living expenses, buy something with bitcoin that you can easily turn around and sell... This avoids having to deal with banks and legal stuff.
Spend some time thinking about what you want to do with your life. Is there a type of business you'd like to start? You might be able to stock your inventory, for such a business, by using bitcoin to buy it.
Consider reading the book Rich Dad, Poor Dad to learn about building up a passive income.

I don't believe you can compare bitcoin to government debt. It would be extremely foolish for any entity to deal with debt within a bitcoin economy (or any deflationary economy). In fact, I believe, a bitcoin economy would encourage balanced budgets among governments (simply because debts would be so devastating).

Taxes are not necessary. There are other means a government can collect revenue and many government services that would be better fulfilled by private markets.
Prior to the 20th century (aside from the civil war), the federal government in the United States did not collect taxes directly from the populous - and it was one of the most prosperous/innovative times in world history.

This is my theory... as each the dollar and the euro collapses, people will rush to metals as well as Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin is such a small economy, the price will start skyrocketing. As it does, holders of Bitcoin will start purchasing assets for next to nothing - particularly real estate and businesses. BUT what this will do is get Bitcoin in the hands of everyday people... I think this will help lessen the blow of any total collapse and prevent society from deteriorating into complete chaos.

As long as the new user inflation outweighs the supply inflation, it will exhibit deflationary properties.

In theory, it's sound... borrow money in an inflationary currency to buy units of a deflationary currency - win. But I too, wouldn't recommend it simply because the Bitcoin economy is still too small (can be influenced by one individual with deep pockets) and, because of that, unpredictable. More than one person lost their ass doing that last time around.

Occasionally a government might do well with cleaning up some mess that another government created (like taking down Hitler)... but even those things are overly costly and ill-managed.
The free market provides much better services than any government does. And with new things like Bitcoin and crowdfunding, any perceived 'need' for government has less of an argument to back it up.

As a note to others... You do not have to go through the extra step of cashing out. There are online retailers that accept bitcoin as payment (like bitcoinstore.com) our you can purchase gift cards to use at local retailers (download the gyft app).

To add to this, credit would just be FAR more risky in a deflationary economy... which would encourage more vetting of borrowers, lessening the impact of such cycles.

As long as the demand to buy bitcoin outweights the demand to sell bitcoin by at least 3600 BTC per day... then it will exhibit deflationary behavior.

I can't tell you much about the specific ad, but I can do my best to tell you about some of the basics of Bitcoin...
Bitcoin went online in early 2009. It was created in reaction to the 2008 financial crisis... the creator supposedly was fed up with how governments manage money and is controlled by the elite. Bitcoin was created to be decentralized (so that it can't be easily shut down) and open-source so that it's behavior would be totally predictable, unlike government currencies.
Bitcoin is best thought of a ledger known as the block chain, that is shared among Bitcoin users. A new block is added to the chain roughly every 10 minutes verifying transactions. The process of adding blocks involves a competitive process called mining that includes a reward of 25 newly generated Bitcoins as well as transaction fees included in the transactions processed within the block. Eventually, there will be no newly generated Bitcoins and miners will be competing for fees alone.
Bitcoins have an advantage to traditional money in that transactions don't involve a 3rd party, such as a bank or VISA/MasterCard... which means far lower fees. Also, transactions are nearly instant, where a credit card may take several business days to complete AND can be charge-back.

We're all familiar with bail-outs now... well, for Americans starting at the beginning of 2014 (and already in practice in Europe), bail-ins will be legal for banks that have over-leveraged. Like Cyprus earlier this year, banks can simply trim a bit off of their customers' accounts. Between this and steadily rising banking fees, distaste for banks is increasing... Bitcoin removes the need for most banking services. This is the appeal of Bitcoin.
On top of this, the need for consumer protection isn't needed nearly as much as it used to be. This is the information age! Thanks to social networks, etc... news about bad business practices spread like wildfire.

While bitcoin is still a small economy, it will continue to be volatile. But it is showing evidence of becoming more stable as the market cap has increased.
There are 3rd party solutions available to merchants that can minimize this risk for them. BitPay is a service that will instantly convert the bitcoin to fiat for the merchant and deposit the fiat in the merchant's bank account.
Some merchants can afford the risk and have benefited from the rises in price... it goes both ways.

What I would like to see is someone make publicly available some basic scripts that people can just copy and paste into their site to run transactions through.
Like for example, I would just want to be able to pass various variables to (in addition to price) through the script and receive back those variables upon confirmation.
Ideally, would like to stay away from bitpay because of % fees.

This year the Bitcoin economy will experience about 14% inflation in it's monetary base... yet prices have dramatically decreased.
Yes, there are considerably more US dollars now than in 2007... most of these new dollars are stuck in bank reserves and not entering the economy. Meanwhile the public has been deleveraging some of it's debt (bankruptcies, foreclosures, etc) - which will cause deflationary behavior in a boated fractional reserve economy. So far, the little amounts of QE that has escaped the reserve system and into the economy has only made up for the deleveraging of the debts. Once the deleveraging slows, and this $3+ trillion begins to be lent out - fractional reserve banking will balloon that to huge proportions... and your inflation will come in full force.
The larger risk to the US economy, in the short term, is a treasury bond collapse.
