I have left reddit for a reddit alternative  due to years of admin mismanagement and preferential treatment for certain subreddits and users holding certain political and ideological views.  
  The abuse of downvotes to silence opposing viewpoints with the automatic 9 minute delay on comments prevents fair flow of ideas and thoughts when only the approved may speak. 
   As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I've ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this message.  
   If you would like to do the same, install [TamperMonkey]( for Chrome, [GreaseMonkey]( for Firefox, [NinjaKit]( for Safari, [Violent Monkey]( for Opera, or [AdGuard]( for Internet Explorer (in Advanced Mode), then add [this GreaseMonkey script](   
 Finally, click on your username at the top right corner of reddit, click on the comments tab, and click on the new OVERWRITE button at the top of the page. You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot.  
   After doing all of the above, you are welcome to join me on a reddit alternative
