Server-trusting wallets (blockchain.info, copay, etc) could just have a server-side component that constantly scans for the user's funds, which isn't so hard. Bread is an SPV wallet, which means it connects directly to the bitcoin network to find out where your money is. That means all components have to be running on your phone, and can't really do anything when you have the Bread app closed.
Currently we use legacy addresses, in a chain of private keys. This means you can recover your wallet with your paper key and recreate the same chain of addresses, and your wallet asks the bitcoin network about each address, for each block in the blockchain.
Adding the current SegWit implementation would require us to add a second chain to preserve privacy and make recovering a wallet possible. And we hear SegWit address formats are set to change again in the near future, in which case we'd need to add a third chain. We'd also need to figure out future-poofing: do we support each address type forever? Do we somehow force people to migrate to a new system with a new paper key? What if they receive funds to an old address or somehow receive funds on the wrong chain? There is a lot of technical issues to work out, and the last thing we want to do is put out a technical implementation that could potentially cause users to lose access to their funds.

I agree. We hope to implement it in January. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:30:40
We do use CPFP, and have for years. RBF is a big UI challenge, which we haven't tackled yet since we've been focused on other priorities. We hear your frustrations, and I hope you believe me when I say we're working on it! Things will get better, as we're now growing the team and will have more bandwidth to get stuff done.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:17:48
We will be implementing custom fees settings in the near future for users like yourself who know what they are doing. Thank you for your patience, as we're working on a lot of things right now (including segwit, etc).
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:36:19
Sorry to hear that! Could you at least let us know what we did to offend you?
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:34:48
Yes, we would like to do this too! We have a huge list of things we want to implement, and now that we are hiring hopefully we'll be able to get more done.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:58:11
Perfectly understandably! Both types of wallets have their uses. I'm not insulted at all :) I just didn't want people to be spreading misinformation that we somehow data-mine our users, when one of our core principles is to specifically not do that.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:14:37
Thank you for your feedback.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:39:34
No wallet will devalue your btc.
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:26:50
Thank you for the feedback on the wording. We thought it was pretty clear: P2SH is backwards compatible because the \_sender\_ doesn't need to support SegWit. Bech32 is not backwards compatible, because the \_sender\_ must support Bech32.
If your wallet supports Bech32 in either of these scenarios, you are fine--you can send and receive your money with no problems.  
Was this an issue you yourself wanted more clarity on, or are you just letting us know you think some users might be confused with the wording?
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:58:34
No problem! The private key stored on a paper wallet is redeemable by a Bech32 wallet regardless of what address format the paper wallet is using.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:32:54
January-ish, probably.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:14:47
Thank you for trying to be helpful, but this statement is incorrect. What fine print are you talking about?
Bread's wallet functionality is 100% free and doesn't collect any personal info. Try it for yourself, and you will notice that you can create a wallet without even registering an email address.
If you want to use one of our partners to purchase bitcoin, you will have to provide them with your personal information as per their policies. But it is not required to use one of these partners.
@_date: 2018-09-26 21:07:11
In order to encourage people to enable sending to Bech32 addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:45:02
The app does not keep auto-sending your transaction. The bitcoin network will hold on to your transaction for some time. Whenever you reopen the app, it checks on the status of your transaction from the network, but does not resend it. Unfortunately the bitcoin network does not allow you to request it forget a transaction, which means we are unable to provide an option to cancel one that is not going through.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:39:59




That's an interesting argument.
Anyway, to show the current bitcoin price in USD, our app needs to fetch our api endpoint that gives the current rate. As with any web server in the world, by connecting to that endpoint your IP address may be exposed to your ISP and our web server. That's what this statement in the privacy policy is talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:31:40
That will be coming as well. Hopefully at the same time as SegWit but I can't say for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:15:23
Hi there,
The OP is horribly mistaken. Please see my reply to them for more details: 
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:33:33
2 weeks I think? It was quietly changed some time back, and I don't remember what it was changed to.
@_date: 2018-09-26 20:44:34


What is your limit? Are you willing to pay $50 to wait 2 weeks?
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:56:09


That's an interesting interpretation. Have you seen any examples of this in the real world? Did consumers boycott DVDs because they could foresee that Blockbuster would stop carrying VHS tapes? Did people push back against smart phones because they didn't want to eventually have to do everything through an app?
These inconveniences certainly happened, but I don't recall them being cause for people to outright reject the advancement of technology. If you can think of any proper examples, please share them!


This is a very weak argument. An exchange using SSS with multiple cold-storage components and generating legacy deposit addresses from an xpub could be way more secure than a company using full Bech32 with their xprv stored in their private Github repo. Looking at what address format they've adopted tells you nothing about their security.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:17:05
Edit: Sorry if you read my previous post, I made a mistake.
This is not a paper wallet. It is what we (Bread) call a "paper key".
A paper wallet has a QR code on it for receiving money, and a single private key (representing one address) that you can use to claim any money sent to it.
The Bread paper key represents all of the addresses in your wallet, and will allow you to restore your entire balance and transaction history on another device.
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:21:34
No, it just means an old *client* can't send BTC to a bech32 address. P2SH allowed old clients that don't understand SegWit to send funds to a SegWit client, Bech32 requires the sender to understand Bech32.
TL; DR: If your wallet can receive the payment, there is no way for it to become lost due to address issues and you will be able to send it to anyone.
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:59:25


That is the entire point of the above-linked website ;)
@_date: 2018-09-27 20:37:52
There are many wooden bridges and many steel bridges. Each person has a pass (wallet) that grants you access to all wooden bridges (legacy wallet) or all steel bridges (segwit wallet). Over time, wood-bridge passes become harder and harder to find and steel bridge passes become easier and easier to find. Establishments that are only accessible via wooden bridge are encouraged to relocate to somewhere accessible via steel bridge, since those passes are becoming so much more common.
@_date: 2018-10-19 17:42:07
OP specified the primary requirement is user-friendliness. Samourai doesn't show you how much your bitcoin is worth in fiat value, which might be considered confusing (FYI to OP!)
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:45:11
Sharing seeds between multiple apps can be dangerous, especially for users who aren't technically savvy. We have no way of knowing if other apps handle security correctly or if your seed has been compromised before you enter it into breadwallet. It's better to simply send your entire balance to a new wallet if you want to switch apps.
@_date: 2018-10-05 17:42:10
They need to be sent to [whensegwit.com]( ;)

@_date: 2017-08-25 22:57:13


It's how bitcoin works. You'd have to talk to the core developers about that.


If it has the most PoW, using the same PoW algorithm, and the block headers are not invalid according to the SPV validation rules, then yes. Again, this is how bitcoin is currently designed to work, it is not a Bread-specific design.


It is not the intended behavior. But it is how bitcoin's consensus system is designed to work. Clients are supposed to assume the chain with the most work is the one that the majority accepts, and everyone (in theory) is supposed to accept the majority. If you don't follow the majority, you wall yourself off onto a minority chain and it is no longer possible to participate in the global economy.
This is the original design of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:26:49
When do you get this message? After pressing a certain button, or starting the app, etc?
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:09:21


SPV is also explained in section 8 of the whitepaper. Here are some other interesting quotes from the whitepaper:




@_date: 2017-08-25 17:24:03


I don't think "continuously monitors" is accurate. If it happens to connect to peers from both chains, it will choose to stick with the peer that is following the chain with the most work. If you only see peers from one chain (which is certainly possible), then your app would have no idea about the other chain.
As for your concrete scenario, that is certainly possible with the way breadwallet is built today. Of course things would be much easier if there was automatic replay protection and an easy way to differentiate chains based on PoW algorithm or something else, but as far as I know that doesn't exist yet.
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:33:22
No, the seed format has remained the same to be backwards compatible with all breadwallets.
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:08:00
I'm sorry, I think my reply might have given you the wrong impression. We do use BIP39, and agree it's important to have a standard people can use to recover their funds elsewhere.
We have thought about letting people easily sweep their funds from other wallets into breadwallet, but at this time we do not intend to let people recover a non-BIP39 seed and continue to use it as their breadwallet seed, or specify a derivation path when creating a new wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-25 04:40:35
It is compatible with any BIP39 wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:32:33
Fees aren't calculated as a percentage of the amount you are sending. The fee would be the same if you were sending $10 or $10 million.
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:25:42
The network fee is required by the bitcoin network, and is always changing. It is affected by how many other people are trying to send transactions at the same time. The amount of bandwidth is limited, and priority is given to people who pay the highest fee.
We try to choose a fee level that is as cheap as possible while still performing well. Right now, there is so much competition (and people paying high fees) that if you were to send with a lower fee it's possible your transaction wouldn't go through for many hours. It might even take a full day or more.
It's not a matter of fairness, this is just how the technology works. For a long time the bitcoin network has been trying to find a solution for how to increase that bandwidth so fees can be cheap again, but a consensus has not yet been achieved.
We show you the fee before you send the transaction, so you can decide if you want to pay it or not. If your payment is not urgent, waiting until weekends or other times when transaction volume goes down will probably make a cheaper fee possible.
Let me know if this doesn't clear it up a bit!
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:08:50
Many people here have been very vocal about wanting to sell their BCH as soon as possible. They contact us daily about it. It seemed like a good idea to keep everyone updated on their options.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:36:56
I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:44:53
Yes, it's possible. If you want to connect to Bitcoin Cash, you just change your rules for validation to enforce the BCH rules, and point it at the Bitcoin Cash DNS seed. If you want legacy bitcoin, you set the rules to the original bitcoin rules and point it at the bitcoin DNS seed. In both of these cases, any crosstalk would be rejected.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:58:34
You keep asking for answers to your questions, so I will try to answer them:


Breadwallet has no opinion. We just release software that connects to bitcoin nodes using the existing, standard rules for SPV. We've included node tethering so users can use it how they wish.


Your breadwallet will listen to whichever node it is connected to, as long as that node follows the original PoW algorithm.


Breadwallet will show your balance based on the information received from the node it is connected to.


Every transaction you send is broadcast by the node you are connected to.


As far as I know, it is not possible for an SPV client to do this.
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:32:00
Don't mean to pull rank here, but actually everything is on schedule. It's still a secret, though.
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:00:15
Highest PoW means cumulative for the entire chain; how much work has been done until now. For all of the questions where you asked if it would just look at the difficulty at the tip: no, it will add up all work done so far and choose the chain with the most actual work.
You are correct about everything else. If Bread decides to follow SegWit2x (or make it an option in the app), we will use the associated DNS seeds and do what it takes to ensure only SegWit2x nodes are connected to. We are still a few months out, so no decision has been made yet. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 04:39:55
Bread uses BIP39, so yes, you can use your breadwallet seed with any BIP39 wallet, or BIP39 key-extraction utility.
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:42:29
Fee selector is all ready to go, boss.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:07:47


The current implementation uses the DNS seeds run by Sipa, Luke-jr, and the others listed on the page I linked. So no, it will not discover sw2x seeds on its own through DNS (unless we change things).


Sorry, the word "longest" shouldn't have been in my statement. The app follows the chain with the most PoW, regardless of if it is longer or not. It selects from nodes it hears about from either the DNS seeds or relayed by nodes it connects to. If one of the nodes found in the above manner tells the app about a sw2x node, it's possible the app will connect to it and compare the PoW values between the legacy chain and the sw2x chain.


_If_ no sw2x nodes are discoverable to the app (because they are not reported by the DNS and not relayed by any peers that are), then the app can never discover the sw2x chain and therefore can't switch to it. If the nodes get mixed together, we will have an issue.


If you don't understand my answers, I ask that you do me the respect of asking follow up questions instead of insulting me. I have explained how the current breadwallet app would treat the fork. I am not talking about what we will do in preparation, because we have not decided yet. We fully understand the implications of the fork, and would be happy to hear your feedback on what needs to be done, but I don't appreciate you telling us what we "must do" and insulting us whenever we explain how the current app would function. Thank you for your understanding.
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:19:11


Breadwallet will choose random nodes from the original [DNS seeds]( Of the nodes it connects to, it will follow the node with the longest PoW chain. The breadwallet software doesn't know which type of node it is connecting to, and therefore can't choose to connect to a specific type by default (unless you use node tethering).


The breadwallet software doesn't know anything about which chain it is connected to. Therefore, the currency displayed in breadwallet is always shown as BTC.


Breadwallet doesn't consider anything. It just signs a transaction based on the inputs it hears about from the node it's connected to, and broadcasts that transaction. On a software level, no currency is specified. It is just a number.
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:23:07
Fee prediction is something we've worked on for quite some time, and as many others have said it's a very difficult problem. You can't predict how many people will come in later and outbid you.
But as a comment on the OP, breadwallet's algo has the price currently set to 30 satoshis/byte. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:34:40
Breadwallet doesn't have any official opinion (yet) on what the "real bitcoin" is.
I personally would say that the network effect of money is key. Imagine this analogy:
200 years ago, gold was a standard currency and store of value. It was considered "real money" because you could take it anywhere and it would be accepted, regardless of where you were.
Then, in the US anyway, paper money replaced gold. Paper money is now vastly more popular than gold for everyday payments--it is accepted anywhere you go, and although gold still exists, it is extremely difficult to spend because not many people accept it.
In this scenario, is paper money an "altcoin" that has "attacked" the gold market? No. Monetary/goldbug theory aside, the market has spoken and paper money is now the preferred currency for everyday use.
It's my personal opinion that the "real bitcoin" is decided by what everyone uses. I don't know if that will be the current chain or SegWit2x or something else altogether, but being forced to pledge undying allegiance to one or another at this point in time is simply political and doesn't really help the community evolve.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:36:10
Yes. Breadwallet validates the PoW value itself, according to the original PoW rules, so it would consider Bitcoin Cash invalid. That's why an entirely separate app would be needed.
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:26:34


The whitepaper mentions nothing about blocksize, so your statement is inaccurate. If you do find mention of it, please let me know.
If you want to use Satoshi's actions and statements as the decider, as Greg mentioned, I would point out that Satoshi quietly added the block size and then said it could easily be raised later. He said the network would have to be in agreement and vote on whether or not to raise the limit, and in the whitepaper he states that hash rate is the mechanism for voting.
I'll just point this out and let you come to your own conclusions:
Satoshi says hash power is votes.
You say 90% of hash power is voting for SegWit2x.
Greg says following SegWit2x violates the rules, but those rules are the ones currently being voted on to change.
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:03:20
You claim we don't listen to our users and instead tell our users what they should want. This is not accurate--we listen to our users, and choose which features to focus on based on a number of criteria. We regularly get feature requests across the board, and Segwit is not the only feature that has been requested by multiple people.
We offer a solution that we think is the best path, and we invite users who also think it is the right path to use us. If you choose to not use us that is your right as an end user, and we respect that. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:05:33
If you ever require help with the Bitcoin portion of our app, our support team will happily help you, and you'll hear back very quickly!
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:50:12


As I have said before, breadwallet does not intend to do this after the fork. This is how the _current_ breadwallet app would work if the fork were to happen today.
We have said multiple times that we will make preparations before the fork. I don't understand what you are trying to get me to say.
@_date: 2018-06-01 23:59:43
Why? We are a bitcoin wallet talking about customer support in the crypto industry.
@_date: 2018-06-02 00:51:47
What is sub-par about it? We are an SPV wallet that connects directly to the bitcoin network, meaning you can access your money even if our servers go down, and we don't have the ability to monitor your transactions. Neither of these are true for other oft-recommended wallets, including, if I am not mistaken, Samourai, GreenAddress, Mycelium, and Copay-based wallets.
Also, do you know of any SPV wallets that have a segwit implementation? If not, then we are not sub-par, because the "par" for SPV does not include segwit. (Please don't interpret this to mean we aren't working on segwit solutions that will work for SPV, because we are)
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:44:17


No, your BTC will not change. If two chains exist, there will be two copies of your money, one on one chain and one on the other. The original design of bitcoin was to follow the chain with the most mining support, which is how Bread works by default. Some users wish to specifically choose which chain to follow regardless of miner support, which is what we are trying to figure out how to support.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:09:22
Yes, in any wallet that allows you to specify derivation path, you can choose m/0'/0 to get your receive addresses, and m/0'/1 to get your change addresses. Good find!
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:02:50
It uses [BIP39]( and [BIP32](
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:25:32
Coming today!!!
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:47:53
Your understanding sounds correct. Not sure what's going on there. Have you sent any transactions from your wallet yet? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:42:29
Is this on Android or iPhone?
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:15:02
Your 12-word phrase _is_ your private key. It can be used as-is in any wallet that supports BIP39 phrases.
If you want to use it in a wallet that doesn't use BIP39, it's a lot more involved, but by having your phrase written down only you are in control of your keys and you are not relying on anyone else.
If you still have access to your old wallet and want to switch to a new wallet, the easiest way is to simply send your entire balance to the new wallet from the old. Entering your phrase in different apps increases the potential attack vectors, so I wouldn't recommend it.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:43:06
Nothing new is being added to the old app (the one that is "breadwallet" and not "Bread").
The new Bread app for Android is currently in beta and will be released soon. Whichever solution we go with will be available on both platforms.
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:30:48
The best way to switch wallet software is to simply send your entire balance to the new wallet. Sharing your paper key between different software can be a security risk, so we don't recommend it.
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:56:02
Our users had millions (billions?) of dollars worth of BCH in their wallets, and it was important for us to give people access to their money. It wasn't a choice of doing BCH instead of SegWit, it was just a matter of timing (no one really supported sending to Bech32 addresses at the time).
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:31:11
BRD is more than just Aaron, and has been for some time. For example, I wrote [this blog post]( outlining our response to the potential 2x fork, explaining how things would work. To quote:


To see what messaging we did or didn't put out, I suggest you go back and read the blog posts on our website (6 about forks, and 2 specifically about SegWit2x).
I'm sorry that our team wasn't big enough to redesign our UI and create a node selection feature to support a potential fork that many suspected wouldn't even happen. I assure you it was not a sign of us "picking sides" and was simply the result of us having a very small dev team at the time.
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:38:55
1. Nope! As I said, we have found a way to use Bech32 to be completely backwards-compatible with existing wallets.
2. Yes, if a) the wallet uses the BIP32 derivation path (many don't), and if b) they support scanning for both legacy and Bech32 SegWit addresses on the same HD chain.
3. Checkout [whensegwit.com]( or our blog posts about SegWit if you want additional info.

Mobile banking apps don't store private keys that, if compromised, could lead to you losing all of your money in an unrecoverable way. They simply connect to a private API, which is very different from connecting directly to the blockchain and doing resource-intensive operations on the client device.
However, I do agree with you outside of the above. But in this case, "not putting the effort in" equates to not being able to afford certain luxuries. A bank with a dev team of 500 (random guess) is going to be able to do a lot more than our team of 25.
For example, the app now expects touch ID to be present and uses the latest Safari APIs. In order to support older devices, we would have to essentially design a second version of the app that offers alternatives to these features, and we would need to dedicate an entire team to focus just on that. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:01:45
At the time, if I recall correctly, Coinbase and most of the popular exchanges didn't support sending to Bech32, and withdrawing coins from centralized platforms is one of the largest use-cases for our user base (receiving payments from Electrum and Bitcoin Core is not the most common use case).
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:32:36
Yes, the private keys are the same but the addresses generated will be different depending on format.
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:41:27
You'd need to do some independent research on this one :) There has been a lot of debate and some people do think there are problems with SegWit. However, by and large it has been embraced by the BTC community and is a standard, supported technology, so at this point there mostly likely aren't any downsides.
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:49:14
Hi there! Important security updates come out with each new version of iOS, and, since we take security *very* importantly, we only support version of iOS that are still receiving security updates. We have no issue with the iPhone 4, but when Apple stopped releasing iOS updates for it we reluctantly had to give up support as well to protect our users.
Also, on the programming side it's hard to provide a consistent experience across 3+ different versions of iOS, since they all do things a little differently.
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:17:11
Correct. Most wallets don't do it the way we do, because it's *hard!*
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:04:41
Sure. The seed phrase is just a starting point (seed!) that is used to generate a list (chain) of private keys. Each private key is used to generate a receive address and spend the coins you receive at that address.
Our Bech32 implementation uses the same chain of private keys as the legacy addresses, so the starting seed is the same.
@_date: 2018-11-16 22:02:05
I used the phrase "truly decentralized SPV wallet"-- "truly" was meant to describe "decentralized" and not "SPV". But to answer your question, SPV is just a protocol. Someone could release an app that uses the SPV protocol but is locked into using that company's servers, essentially requiring you to rely on them. Our implementation connects your phone directly to the bitcoin network without going through us, which is something hardly anyone else does.
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:20:51
We didn't want to remove users' privacy, security, and \_choice\_ by locking them into our infrastructure in order to force them onto one side of the fork (a fork which never happened). So instead we continued to provide the standard SPV protocol and let users specify a specific node to connect to if they wanted to make a choice.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:36:53

I do, and I'm sorry about that. The crypto landscape is always changing and things tend to get shifted around. I shouldn't have made a promise that specific, especially being so far out.

I believe the card issuers that have banned crypto purchases are mainly in the US. Looks like the rest of the world is still in luck, for now!

We don't have a merchant status. We partner with well-vetted companies that offer their services through our platform. Our credit card partner is legally compliant and has been in business for some years now, so we don't anticipate any issues.

It depends on your bank. Our CC provider will process it as a regular credit transaction.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:30:44
As I said, the functionality will be rolled out slowly over the next week. I believe it is only credit for now.

I'm curious about the more consumer-focused services, like Coinbase, Jaxx, mycelium, airbitz, etc.

Both legacy and Bech32 use the same derivation path.

Thank you for the follow-up. We think we have identified the issue and are working on a fix.

So what if that block isn't bigger than 1MB? Do we need to then download every block after that until the fork actually happens? What if it takes a few days before the first &gt;1MB block is mined? That's an extra 144MB per day our users would need to download over their mobile connections, which is too much for most people's data plans.

Yes, it will work with cards in nearly every country. We are rolling the feature out slowly this week so you will see it soon.

Credit cards are inherently expensive. Normally merchants absorb the fees with the markup on their products, which means you as the consumer are still paying for the card service, albeit indirectly. Using cards to essentially buy money (e.g. bitcoin) will always have pretty substantial fees, since there is no markup to absorb the cost.
This is what bitcoin is meant to fix! But the first step is to migrate people away from credit cards, and the best way to do it is to let people use their cards to buy bitcoin ;)

Nope, if you wipe it using the "start/recover another wallet" it can't be recovered.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:46:49
I'm not surprised it didn't last long. You could simply cycle card =&gt; btc =&gt; cash =&gt; card, and if you had a card with good perks you'd be making a 1% profit in the form of cash back or miles every time!

More information will be coming out very soon.

This is a great overview of the situation. Your technical assumptions are correct.
However, being an SPV wallet Bread is not able to detect the weight of new blocks, so it would not be possible to search for the FatBlock.
It seems the only solution would be to have a server figure out the block hashes of each chain and provide that via API, so our SPV clients can differentiate which chain they are on. However, this creates a huge vulnerability, because an attacker would only need to compromise this API or perform a MITM attack to trick Bread to follow an invalid/malicious chain. For that reason, we would only want to distribute checkpoints by hardcoding them into the app, which means we wouldn't be able to do any of this until we are able to release an update post-fork.
Any other ideas?

It is normal for your balance to not show until syncing is finished. Please switch to Wifi and see if syncing continues like normal. If you can't get it to work, please contact support

It's in internal beta now, if there are no catastrophic problems we are hoping to start external beta by the end of next week!
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:52:24
I would be interested to hear what you find out! There are many regular users who don't comment on Reddit, so the feedback wallet providers get directly from their users might differ from what you see in this community.

What solution do you suggest?

Real good! Public beta for New Bread On Android™ will be announced soon, including buy bitcoin.

What if that block isn't bigger than 1MB? (i.e. the fork doesn't happen on that exact block)
