What do you guys think of bitpay? I really like the idea of the bitcoins being automatically exchanged and deposited into my account. I'm just worried that I'll take a hit on the exchange rate.

To clarify, guys. This is my main income, but I have to also do what's best for my business. If this means waiting, so be it.

I don't mind waiting for users to get used to the new method.

I disagree many payment options increases conversion. Some fee uncomfortable giving credit card information on certain sites, bitcoin would be a perfect solution for this. I also face the problem of paying sellers with a credit card solution. My sellers are located all over the world and it would be difficult to pay them if all the funds are collected in one bank account.

I would love to use PayPal, however problems in the past and them being not so keen on the industry has led to me being unable to use them again.

Have you given users a method of buying bitcoins, if they do not already own some?
@_date: 2015-05-15 11:27:50
Believe me, I've contacted a lot of high risk merchant providers. While some are positive about opening account, this still leaves the problem of me paying my sellers that are based worldwide.

I would also want to allow users to buy bitcoins there and then if they do not have the amount for the purchase, is this possible?

The reason I'm resorting to btc, is due to me not being able to find other payment options.

My main competitor has managed to use PayPal and Skrill, both of which have declined my application.

Yep, I've had the same problems with PayPal. I eventually got into talks with Skrill, who rejected my application at the last hurdle. Despite offering service to a competitor of mine which does the exact same thing.

This is my job. I need to make money from this.

When going to purchase they will only have the option to purchase with bitcoin. With a second option for those without bitcoin to purchase and buy their product.

Yep, you're completely right. Only problem is finding an alternative payment option
