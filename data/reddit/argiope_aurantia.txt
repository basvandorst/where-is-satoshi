1) You choose to load a digital gift card, generated by Fold, with $5, $10, or $20. 2) Send BTC to pay for it at a 20% discount. 3) Pay for your Starbucks purchase using the digital gift card. 4) Request refund (and supply your desired btc refund address) to receive any remaining balance on the digital gift card.  
  
It sounds a little clunky, but it's actually quite simple.  
  
Also, FWIW, the Starbucks employees have no idea you are using something other than a Starbucks card. One employee even noted the low balance after my purchase and asked me if I would like to reload it. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 15:42:55
I have used Fold approximately a dozen times to purchase coffee from Starbucks. On multiple occasions (three, IIRC) I received no change or the incorrect amount of change and had to contact support. Each time, support was very quick to respond and resolved the issues right away. It's a great service, if a bit inconsistent; I raise this only to remind users to keep an eye out when receiving change.

I understand and see your point, but where to draw the line? Should they also lock coins suspected/known to be used in buying/selling illegal drugs, or for gambling, or to pay for sex between consenting adults? An argument could be made that an exchange that locks coins for suspected theft could be willing to also lock coins for other reasons that might vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, culture to culture. This makes me *less* willing to trust them. That said, I fully support the exchange's right to do as they please provided such prohibitions are noted in their TOS.

Would be an issue if there was an Event that prompted many big holders to want to cash out at once, but it would likely mean the Event is significant enough that liquidity would be just one of many big problems. Chances are, absent such an Event, any one holder would be much smarter to let the coins trickle out over time so as to not disrupt the price, thereby maximizing profit. 
@_date: 2013-03-16 13:00:05
Well, they ARE linked so long as US vendors denominate the price of their products/services in USD but also allow payment in an equivalent amount of BTC, as determined by the current market price (which means the amount of BTC it takes to buy the pizza fluctuates while the amount of USD stays flat). 
If I'm understanding correctly, then what you've described is true ONLY if the pizza shop decides to fix their BTC price for pizza and instead allows their USD price to float independently, right?

So... if it costs $47 to buy 1 BTC today, and inflation drives the dollar to be worth half what it is now, then it would take twice as many dollars ($94) to buy that same 1 BTC.
But, so long as the USD remains essentially the world's reserve currency, other governments would have no choice but to inflate their own currencies... which means that the same 1 BTC would neither gain or drop in REAL value, even though it's price relative to USD would double, right?

Congrats, and welcome to the club! There are thousands of vendors that accept it, so it really depends what you want to purchase. Or, you can hold it in your account on Coinbase, move it to an online wallet provider like blockchain.info for (relatively) safe keeping, transfer it to an exchange like bitstamp or CampBX to trade in and out of bitcoin/USD and try to increase your holdings, or even create what's called a paper wallet for super-safe keeping. You can also set up an account with the reddit bitcoin tip bot and use it to tip other reddit users. ;) Have fun!

@_date: 2013-03-28 22:00:44
Point taken. That said, suppose a buyer places an order in good faith. Then, half an hour later the value of BTC falls out. The seller then decides he can make more money selling it for cash on ebay, so he pulls the plug. I have a hard time seeing how any system that favors a seller that blatantly over a buyer could be sustained.
@_date: 2013-12-13 12:17:15
I'm assuming Coinbase doesn't post the public addresses of their wallets... which means we have no way of auditing or verifying their holdings. What's to stop them from going fractional? That is, receive USD from buyers but deliver BTC only upon withdrawal and keep a blended reserve of USD and BTC rather than 100‰ BTC? 
Come to think of it, that might be a smart and safer move. They are arguably more likely to experience a panic sell-off than a panic transfer-out, so cash on-hand would be a good thing in their eyes.  That is, unless customers get spooked while the overall bitcoin economy remains healthy.... 
What would a run on Coinbase look like? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:45:12
... Which is critical if BTC is to gain wider business adoption. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:57:35
This exactly. I want to support merchants who accept BTC, I want to preserve privacy while lowering my risk of identity theft while shopping, I want to help grow the network. But I don't want to watch my stash dwindle away while doing it. So, buy-as-I-spend allows me to do all of the above. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:44:21
I disagree, particularly if you think about bitcoin as a technology rather than a currency or stock. Much in the same way the tech bubble separated the players from the pretenders, a crash like this could serve to dampen price hysteria and return focus to fundamentals, be it at the BTC level or at the exchanges.

So say we all.
@_date: 2013-03-16 13:45:39
YES - now I get it. The hard upper limit is what will theoretically keep it from inflating directly alongside the USD. Thank you for this important point.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:52:06
So, Bitmit bids are non-binding? That's lame if true - why would anyone accept an order if the value of BTC fell? Can a buyer equally retract his bid?

Here's the encouraging response I got from Pandora:

Small-batch absinthe. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:38:55
Wow, I had no idea it was so restrictive. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:10:44
Fair enough.

Are Icelanders currently unable to exchange Krona for USD or other foreign fiat currencies, such as prior to traveling overseas? Must they wait until on foreign shores to convert?

Don't get Gox-blocked - buy Lagcoin today!
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:50:02
This. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:27:48
Correct. It is transferred in as USD and held as USD until you instruct Mt. Gox to execute a trade. 
@_date: 2013-03-24 13:11:03
Buy in increments. Throw a few bucks at it every few weeks to spread your risk over price and time. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:00:16
Very sorry you had to learn such an expensive lesson. I suggest you take a step back and think about where you went wrong and what your goals are. If you are young, you'll have plenty of time to recover, and it probably won't be the last mistake you make.   
  
If you vow to learn from your experience, you might consider it the cost of "tuition" and move forward without too much regret. Best of luck to you!

I've gone to a safe-locked paper wallet just so I don't do anything irrational. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:35:03
Seems like they are referring to exchanges outside India... in which case, Indian users of an Indian exchange are fine (my opinion only, I am not a lawyer, blah blah blah).
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:36:26
Hadn't seen that, thanks for sharing [takes off tinfoil hat and quietly folds it up for use another day]
@_date: 2013-03-22 14:26:06
Same here. Also getting an Invalid Request error on the mobile app. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:10:38
I find unconfirmed transactions often appear in seconds, though it can take [many minutes]( to achieve full confirmation (6+, I believe).
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:01:28
No different than the current system, except that you might have an actual  chance to join the BTC Top 1‰... 
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:55:52
Congrats! But... what area do you cover? I could not find any location listing on the site, and I'm too lazy to research the area code.
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:30:45
Submitted my order on Wednesday, 3/27. Two days later I have not received an order confirmation despite showing a successful transaction on blockchain.info.
Messages to help have gone unanswered. What's up?
UPDATE: Though I never received an order confirmation or any response to my emails, I DID end up receiving the magazine I ordered, less than one week after ordering. Prompt service, all things considered, I just wish there had been better (any) communication.
@_date: 2013-03-31 19:04:09
Still nothing from Bitcoin Magazine. No order confirmation, no replies to my repeated emails to support - going on 5 days now. Hoping to post good news, but so far, buyer beware.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:13:21
I got nothin'. Dad's going to have to wait for me to send him his first Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:53:24
How's your confidence?
@_date: 2013-03-16 21:12:12
Interesting thought, but there would still be exchanges, just person-to-person. There would me nothing to prevent me from (illegally) paying my neighbor $50 for his 1BTC. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:39:29
Or, when Europe wakes up and the price is holding, it could spark a new round of confidence.

As I write this, their exchange rate is $13 USD higher ($91) than the current Mt. Gox trade value ($78). If you're anxious to get out, consider spending your coins where they'll be worth more than you would get in cash.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:29:18
Time to start ?
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:04:27
Or they are looking to cash in on an anticipated market exodus.
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:52:17
They're a business that publishes a legitimate magazine (yes, I've seen and own hard copies). What motivation would they have to scam their own userbase? I'm not convinced it's a scam, I'm more concerned that there's a fail within their ordering process. Anyone else?
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:20:25
Lagness Monster!
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:31:30
Decrease as American national pride would run rampant and the dollar would surge on the strength of ramped up militarization and related production. That, and decreased media coverage of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:56:53
Congrats guys. There can be a delay as the network confirms the validity of the transaction. It depends, too, where you are sending the coins FROM. Wallet-to-wallet typically seems faster than Exchange-to-wallet for me.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:53:47
Yep, I am good to go now. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:17:09
The sooner the Chinese government outright forbids ownership of BTC, the better. Sure, it will shake the market, but then we'll get over it and move on without them. Then, young smart Chinese can take BTC to the black market where it can serve to fund The Revolution. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:31:04
Mine are moving again too. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:41:00
Whoa. You read my mind. Are you spying on me? WHO PAY YOU?!?! 
@_date: 2013-03-16 12:34:14
By that logic, we should do away with cash as well.
@_date: 2013-12-23 11:51:22
Depends on the user. For those on my list who are more sophisticated, I plan to give a paper wallet and some brief suggestions on tools, charts, etc.   
  
For those with less sophistication, I plan to walk them through setting up an online wallet and actually transfer BTC gift into it as part of the demonstration, followed by a brief intro to Coinbase if they think they want to do more... with a paper wallet follow-up lesson if they decide to accumulate more than pocket change. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:30:29
I'm a believer in the tech. It has nothing to do with short-term value.
