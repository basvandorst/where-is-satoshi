lol objective? it's not a debate.
@_date: 2018-08-17 22:27:48
i know right.  ppl are so stupid
@_date: 2018-08-16 23:34:06
hate?  i'm not the one censoring, buddy.  those are the ones full of that emotion you speak of.
truthers are innocent.
are you on the right side?
@_date: 2018-08-18 00:27:40
or i have higher senses and you don't like that i do.
@_date: 2018-08-17 23:43:59
the coin has a large block size and 1 minute blocks or something like that.

monsanto just got sued and lost a lawsuit about their product roundup causing cancer in our foods.
he talked all the time about it.
he tells more truth than govts/media.  if he lies, it's either not meant, or not as much as govts/media.
again, no one is perfect.
but IF you had to pick ONE, would you rather be kicked in the face, or run over by an 18 wheeler?
USE DISCERNMENT.
one is BETTER than the other.
EVOLVE.  GROW.  pick the lesser of the two evils.  stop worryign about being perfect.
@_date: 2018-08-18 00:19:07
it's more a white blood cell response.
if you've been involved, you would know this.

homie, hippies ARE conservative.  they're about CONSERVING the planet.  hello!!!!

youtube just gave a strike to some youtube channel called h3h3 productions, even though that channel was defending youtube censoring AJ.
yes, people are waking up.
@_date: 2018-08-16 23:34:45
btw, trump is president.  i'm happy!  and loving life!  people are waking up in DROVES!
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:16:46
... this was huge news recently dude.... come on. srsly.  at least get on my level if you're gonna talk.
@_date: 2018-08-16 23:35:52
i already said no one is perfect.
learn to use discernment.
a few centralized entities(govt/media/corporations) are bullying individuals who speak the truth.
check yourself.
@_date: 2018-08-16 23:28:48
at first they came for the jews, but i did not speak out because i was not jewish...
then they came for me, and no one was left to speak for me.
@_date: 2018-08-16 23:29:37
this isn't politics, child.
this is about censorship.
govts, corporations, media are all doing it and are BIASED.
you think bitcoin is a liberal technology?  lol, it was created by LIBERTARIANS who are CONSERVATIVES.
ask questions, kid.  humble thyself.
@_date: 2018-08-18 00:42:13
you are literally the worst sub on reddit.
@_date: 2018-08-18 00:07:51
to show that bcash is pointless.  it's using their logic to show them how silly they are.  use your head.
@_date: 2018-08-15 01:34:29
@_date: 2018-08-16 23:30:43
the govt tells the most lies.
so does fake news CNN.
alex jones isn't perfect but he tells 1,000,000x more truth than those mafias.
guess what?  i dont even watch AJ!
@_date: 2018-08-15 01:35:49
lol coulda made 15% on ur btc by dumping bcash
@_date: 2018-08-17 22:28:17
it's actually on topic.  you know better.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:50:27
nothing in the NYA details what you just said, so it's ambiguous at best.
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:56:59
for original bitcoin, you're right
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:45:22
um.  no point in holding sw2x coin since it's corporate coin with 1 developer who is in bed with govt.  might as well stick with fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:37:29
with your logic, then other pools only have to devote .0001% hash to SW2x and they would still be "complying".  
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:51:17
yup, and so can anyone at this point. :) 
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:54:30
actually, i don't get the limited posting in other reddits so obviously btc censors ppl.  ppl in this forum are nowhere near as bad as btc.  this forum is a million times more positive
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:38:36
viaBTC did sign the NYA, dude.  get your facts straight.  do any of you do research proper?  not only that, bitcoin.com ALSO broke the NYA.  not to mention most likely bitmain who is mining bch.
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:07:57
did you read the tweet?
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:32:54
lol, i've never been censored here AND the first times i ever posted in r/btc as a NEUTRAL individual, i was only able to post like once every 10 minutes.  and then they downvote you to a oblivion there if you're not on their train and then you can only post every other day.  so at that point, you can't even clarify points to ppl over there because you would have to wait 10min-10 hours to make a reply and i'm not doing that.  no one will
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:45:59
nowhere in the agreement does it say they're obligated to 100% hash to SW2x.  
it also doesn't say for how long they have to commit hash to it.
two can play this game.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:39:25
with your logic, then other pools only have to devote .0001% hash to SW2x and they would still be "complying".

@_date: 2017-08-21 19:59:36
i also don't see the harm in them continuing to mine the original bitcoin chain that is backed by Core.
again, two can play this game.  and remember, Core didn't start this game.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:18:43
the market values a coin backed by Core more than one by corporations.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:45:28
bcash is a forked original bitcoin.
users will stick to a coin backed by Core, not a corporate coin no matter how much hash it temporarily has.
mining on original bitcoin is not a violation of NYA and does not mean you don't support segwit2x.  miners can mine original btc with 99.999999999999999999999999999999999% of their hash and only .00000000000000000000000000000000000001% for sw2x and still be supporting NYA.  show me the details that show otherwise.
actually, most ppl are for original bitcoin, not sw2x.  sw2x was done because ethereum/alt-coins were about to flippen bitcoin and barry silbert is on record stating this was why SW2x was formed.  nothing about technical need at that point in time nor is it now.
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:01:36
so u have to give the signature to someone so they can verify that it's you?  so it is safe to give this to someone w/o getting ur btc stolen?
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:58:01
with your logic, then other pools only have to devote .0001% hash to SW2x and they would still be "complying".  cheers!
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:34:27
nope, cuz i dont get that limit in this reddit

... you realize mcdonald's workers make minimum wage like 7-8 bucks an hour here in the states, right?  not sure how your'e making that much unless you're a manager
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:10:38
haha you noticed that
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:58:20
you just proved my point.  being ashamed and feeling exposed so he unliked it.
EXPOSED AGAIN.  THANKS for the investigative work, BROTHER
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:11:13
OR he unliked it because he doesn't want everyone to know how EVIL he is?  he may not even FEEL ASHAMED.  sociopaths and all, Y'KNOW BRO
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:03:14
but you'd have all your bitcoin on one address instead of a bunch of different ones.  and yes i mean same wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:20:06
LYING through their teeth, in PUBLIC no less
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:55:58
it shouldn't be taxed because it took value AWAY from bitcoin on the date of the fork, MEANING it essentially is a PART of bitcoin.  it should NOT be taxed, but you'll probably hear some blowhards saying otherwise.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:15:06
and for the RECORD, BROTHER, SW2x is Dead On Arrival.  There is NO FUD.  bitcoin lives on.  RELAX
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:53:16
i find it funny you have the bs energy to write this but not investigate the scammy behavior of shillbert grape and jeffrey garlic.  NOTED
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:51:57
he liked a tweet that said SW2x will cause a chain split that will cause chaos and that he's long ETH and short BTC
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:44:49
you make 15-20 DOLLARS an hour as minimum wage at McDonald's and have 150k in savings as a result?  gtfo here
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:57:01
do u know generally how long after the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:15:32
i just trolled the f out of them saying bitcoin and got myself banned and then said bitcoin again to the mods and got muted from messaging the mods.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:01:41
i wouldn't trust it after Hoffman advocates for a centralized bitcoin.  NO THANKS.  
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:28:12
what if just bitmain pools pull out?
