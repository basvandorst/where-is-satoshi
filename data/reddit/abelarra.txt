Honestly, try typing Bitcoin or Bitcoin ATM into Google maps. Worked for me

Best way to buy sats without verification?

It's getting tactical in here
@_date: 2019-11-08 14:45:15
Yay! A dip on payday!

Is BRD an ok place to start to stash some sats? At least until I can get some cold storage going?

Questions: has BTC been used to purchase real estate yet? I saw the car sale post, which is exciting, but when BTC can buy land, I think I will really be pumped.
Also, does anyone have an article or something that lays out BTC's best criticisms? I just don't want to be in an echo chamber here.
Lastly, correct me if I'm wrong, but true stability and growth for Bitcoin in the future requires adoption as a true currency that can be useful for the masses as a real purchasing tool. Not just a neat thing you can use on some websites... Otherwise it's value is as made up as any unbacked currency?

What's the connection between those?

I'm using Kraken

Shit is on sale

I'mma B that D!

I hope so. I'm not going to be rich with like .04 of a coin.
I have catching up to do.
Buy the dip, y'all

Tomorrow is payday... And instead of being all excited to buy anything else, I'm just pumped my weekly Bitcoin allowance is coming!

I always was kinda sad thinking I'd never be able to afford a whole Bitcoin at a time...
Now I'm thinking maybe I'll be able to by January

Happy to be on the waves!

We have gray market things like sports gambling, gambling online, legalized marijuana, ordering marijuana to the home, and more.
Honestly, Bitcoin really lends itself to these markets.

I mean, define paycheck to paycheck...
I budget all my bills and needs carefully, including savings.
Then my leftover funds are for fun and whatever. Including investing in things like Bitcoin. Mayhaps I have spent my budget of discretionary funds until my next check... 
Does that seem reasonable?

Bull markets after the halving... Hang on til next July. You'll be a happy camper.
@_date: 2019-09-30 21:47:06
I hear you.
 It's hard to try and keep diversified investments when Bitcoin is so attractive.
Seeing this last dip, I wanted to liquidate things and buy-in so hard... I guess I'm not a true believer, lol.

Just bought my first .01 Bitcoin.
Better not drop anymore.
