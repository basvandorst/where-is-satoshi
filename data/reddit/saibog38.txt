The bottom line is that I do think the legal system should try to be "reasonable" in assigning liability, but I don't think limited liability (at least as it exists now) should really be part of that equation.  If this discourages individuals from taking on too much responsibility then I'd be ok with that; I think that's actually part of allowing a more equitable distribution of wealth to naturally emerge (responsibility and compensation tend to go together).

This probably makes the most sense for them since it means no set of users have much to gain through litigation.  If they tried to assign the losses to certain accounts/assets then those affected would have a lot to gain by litigating and forcing a liquidation across all assets.

I'm saying this is really no different than n-of-m where BFX holds all the keys, since it appears that their bitgo authtoken is functionally interchangeable with bitgo's keys (bitgo does whatever the holder of the auth token tells them to do with no human-in-the-loop sanity/fraud checks, apparently).  This is clearly not a scheme that is resistant to BFX getting hacked, which is how it was advertised.  There really needs to be some meat-space verifications in that loop somewhere, at least for highly suspicious activity (like sudden withdrawals of a shit ton of bitcoin).

Fair enough, but honestly placing a market order on GDAX is pretty damn simple; the biggest hassle in the whole buying process is account verification which is the same for Coinbase or GDAX.  The interface is obviously more intimidating on GDAX with all the market data, but actually placing a market order is about as simple as it is to purchase bitcoin on the Coinbase site; just enter an amount and click "buy".
I also think that for noobs, it's better to have them deposit USD to their Coinbase/GDAX account and *then* make their bitcoin purchase, since that way it clearly shows that the delay is due to the time it takes to deposit USD to their account; the bitcoin purchase happens instantly.  The "buy bitcoin then wait 4-5 days to get it" process tends to annoy some people and cause them to think it's bitcoin/Coinbase that's so slow.  You can do the USD deposit -&gt; purchase bitcoin instantly process on both the main Coinbase site and GDAX, but on GDAX that's the only way to do it whereas the Coinbase site tends to shuttle people towards the "buy then wait" process.
Just my two cents.

Fair enough, my main objection is the difference in protections between sole proprietorships (i.e. individuals) vs corporations.  If our legal system is too litigious then I'm not happy with the solution being protections *for corporate structures*.  I'd prefer that there only exist legally equal individuals in the eyes of the law, and if there's problems with the legal system on that level then we should fix them on that level.

Payment channels are great if you only need to aggregate a net balance of funds moving within a channel.  If the point of Kim's microtransaction-per-upload is to embed some data into the blockchain then payment channels won't be useful for that; you'd need a unique on-chain transaction for every piece of data you wish to publish to the blockchain.
Can't say anything for sure without more info though; this snippet is hopelessly vague.  The fact that he says "linked to" rather than something like "paid for" makes me think it has something to do with on-chain data rather than just a simple micropayment, but who knows.

I agree, and most people who lost money probably care about getting their money back first and justice second.  You can't pay your bills with justice.

All I'm concerned about is that liability be fairly assessed (I think we agree on that point), but I don't think any blanket limitations or shields should be part of that assessment.  I also don't think that non-person corporate entities should even exist; I'd rather have an economy comprised exclusively of sole proprietors who may or may not collaborate with others through contractual relationships.  Sure, it would add a fair amount of friction to operate in a similar manner to the large and centralized corporate entities of today, but I think that's a healthy counterweight to the advantages of efficiencies of scale.  I also think it naturally incentivizes a dispersion of responsibility throughout those structures, and with it compensation as well.  
I don't think it's healthy that corporate entities are treated differently than individuals in the eyes of the law.

Some nitpicks:


*Limited liability* corporations (i.e. basically all of them) are bad, imo, as is any scheme that divorces responsibility and liability from power, as it throws off the balance of incentives discouraging bad behavior.  Some might argue this is necessary due to an overly litigious society, but I'm not a fan of the "two wrongs make a right" approach to problem solving.


I think this is currently true, due to a variety of factors ranging from legally enshrined rent-seeking behavior to socialization of risk/losses.  I recognize this as a problem, I just don't think taxes and redistribution are the solution.  I do think that a "free-er" economy stripped of these legislative injustices would naturally have a more equitable distribution of wealth.


Why is this even noteworthy?  When I worked in the US defense industry (aerospace) I had plenty of muslim coworkers; the tech world especially is highly multi-cultural.  I find it a little strange that this even stands out to you as odd.  If anything, it would be unusual if a "hacker group" *wasn't* multi-cultural.

You're looking at what you gain from a split, but you're not considering what you lose, which is network effect.  Network effect is such that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  A split is only beneficial if the gain you're talking about (people can choose the network that better serves them, with energy redirected from infighting to more constructive endeavors) outweighs the loss in network effect.  That's why you shouldn't split every time there's a disagreement, but there is a threshold out there where if the disagreement is sufficiently contentious and destructive then a split may become beneficial.
I do think in general that the community is overly biased towards thinking splits are bad.  They have their downsides, but so does all the internal conflict, like you mentioned.  Of course, it helps if they're done properly (like preventing replay shenanigans).

I think we can all agree that the speculative "moon" predictions re: bitcoin should not be described as "accurate".  We can argue about whether they are plausible or not, and to what degree, but "accurate" doesn't really belong in this discussion (we can save that term for predictions in the deterministic sciences).
Personally, I think the "moon" predictions are plausible because in the history of money, we've never had a way of reliably implementing the property of "collectively agreed upon scarcity".  We've had physical scarcity in the form of gold, which is an important factor in its durability as money (as well as other properties it has that are conducive to monetary functions, but I won't get into those here for the sake of brevity), but in the "social contract" formations of money, we've always had central points of control and thus failure (government fiat falls under this category).  I think the architecture of bitcoin which allows for a collectively agreed upon monetary social contract to be enforced in a decentralized way is potentially a key innovation in monetary history, and that's why I think its ascendance up the monetary ladder is plausible, though far from certain.

I don't think a "dictator" of any sort is a fair comparison considering the only way core has any power over bitcoin is if the ecosystem opts to run their code.  Are they really a dictator if the people can fire them at will?  I'd say no, and that's also what prevents them from being a central point of failure; if they somehow get co-opted or whatever then people can either refuse to update or choose a different client.

Do you mean why is it interesting?  Why wouldn't the amount of value being moved per block be an interesting metric?  If transaction throughput starts plateauing due to blocksize limitations, then the value per block metric would be one of the better indicators of growing/shrinking demand for bitcoin (value of fees paid is more interesting imo, but nonetheless value moved/block is still interesting).

The top-level goals of bitcoin as a monetary system are/were obvious to many people, such that I don't think it makes any sense to declare anyone the "founding father" of those concepts.  True "e-cash" was considered the holy grail of the cypherpunk movement for a long while, and a finite supply limit is a wet dream for anyone who doesn't believe that deflation is bad (this set of people largely overlaps with those who value the liberties of cash).  Really the only non-obvious solution offered by bitcoin was the process for nakamoto consensus, and for that I'd probably credit Szabo as the primary originator since the blockchain/PoW design of bitcoin seems pretty obviously inspired by the process Nick outlined in his [bitgold proposal]( and even then that's building off of the work of others.
I don't really see much in the Nash theories since I don't see anything in bitcoin that's uniquely creditable to him.  Some of the ideas overlap but those weren't unique in the slightest.  The actual novel aspects of bitcoin don't point anywhere near Nash.

Saving tendencies are influenced by real "risk free" interest rates, which historically are generally in the 2-3% range (but can periodically drift well out of that range, this being one of those times to the low side).  Real "risk free" rates are not a cleanly defined statistic, but a common approximation is real yield on 10 year bonds of reserve currency issuing sovereigns.  The inflation rate only factors in such that real rates = nominal rates / inflation rate.  Incidentally, the rate of "real interest" on a deflationary money with fixed supply would eventually range around the rate of real growth in the economy, which averages around 3% (give or take a few depending on which economy you're talking about, but that's close to the global average).
The "deflationary store of value" role in the fiat monetary system is served by the sovereign debt of the currency issuer.  That's the "risk free" form of savings in that system (nothing is truly risk free, but the term is used in the best approximate sense), and serves the functional equivalent of stuffing deflationary money under a mattress.  A currency issuer has no need to borrow its own money  - it can always just print more (hence the debt being considered "risk free", at least nominally), though budgets do still need to be managed to control inflation.  People do however need to be able to save in order to have a healthy economy.  That's why the currency issuing state still "borrows".  If you take away the ability for people to stuff their cash under the sovereign's mattress and earn a safe and modest return, you effectively have permanent negative interest rates, or something close to that (assuming usual inflation targets).
The optimal rate of real interest is not at all a well defined concept in economic circles.  If it is defined, it's defined to the extent of "the rate of interest that produces optimal results", which shifts the controversy over to how exactly we calculate that.  The fed tries (at least in theory), but this is not a deterministic task, and with no meaningful counterfactual it's hard to objectively evaluate their performance.

Agree with most of your point but I don't think Coinbase moving away from describing themselves as a wallet is a good example; I'm pretty sure that had mostly to do with the fact that the KYC/AML burden from their exchange status doesn't mix well with trying to be a wallet as well.  You'll often hear people complaining about getting their account closed, but it's no good for Coinbase either if they have to ban users since they send money to a gambling site/darknet market/whatever because they're using Coinbase as their wallet.

I'm fine with a better polling process that can serve as another signal among many, to be considered by the economic majority (for lack of a better term).  I would be against any additional direct control of anything via voting mechanisms.

Agree to an extent, but the nature of these things is that the demand for the fork rises gradually and non-uniformly throughout the various stakeholders in the ecosystem, and there will always be opposition to any hard fork until people feel that there's a good enough reason to do one, so there will be a point where some people start wanting it and others think it's still unnecessary, or not worth the bloat in data size, risks, etc, and people will argue about it and take their sides and some will be childish about it and slander the opposition and blah blah blah.  In the end it will happen once the demand for it *overwhelms* the opposition, which will be well after the first few started pushing for it, and after a lot of argument and debate and butthurt along the way.  Even if the change itself is relatively uncontroversial, the debate over *when* it becomes necessary and optimal to do it will always have plenty of controversy, since there's no obviously right answer.
And that's fine :)  People just need to get used to that contentious consensus process, and ideally not get as butthurt about it when things aren't going their way.  It's this onerous process that safeguards the network from actual controversial hard forks being pushed through.

What I'm saying is that lightning network might be so useful that I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't decrease demand on the base layer.  People will potentially start using bitcoin for a lot of things they didn't before, and that could offset any substitution effect it has on existing transactions.  
In other words, I think lightning makes blockchain space much more valuable, and thus demand may rise as well, which could mean higher fees on the base layer (it's a lot easier to justify a high fee to open a decent sized payment channel that gets used for a lot of things vs a one time payment).  I think it's more likely to cause an explosion in overall bitcoin transactions (including lightning transactions obviously) but I'm not so sure it will correspond to a significant reduction in demand for on-chain transactions.  I feel like adoption + growth might offset any benefit there.  We'll see.

Inflation only helps debtors if it's unexpected.  Otherwise it's priced into interest rates (look at interest rates during the high inflation of the 70's/80's).  Paying 8% in a 2% inflationary currency is roughly the same thing in real terms as paying 4% in a 2% deflationary currency.  So yeah, if your inflationary currency suddenly changes to a deflationary one, that causes problems for debtors.  That's not a counterargument against a deflationary-by-design monetary system though.  It's an argument for why we shouldn't try to make the Dollar deflationary, since it's a unit of account that has the expectation of being inflationary.
Also note, "debtors/savers" doesn't exactly correspond to "poor/rich" in the way we might usually assume.  There are people living with very modest means who have decent savings, and there are people in heavily mortgaged mcmansions making payments on a garage full of vehicles who may be net in debt.  You can't really judge whether someone is a saver/debtor by looking at outwardly displayed wealth.

For one, bitcoin will become more stable the bigger it gets, that's just the reality of economic inertia and how bitcoin relates to other capital markets.  
As far as loans - both inflation and the performance risk of the loan are baked into the interest rate you're paying.  A world with a deflationary monetary base will also have lower nominal interest rates all around.  It will look nominally quite different, but won't change much in real terms.
For example, a 7% loan denominated in a 2% inflating currency is similar in real terms to a 3% loan denominated in a 2% deflating currency.

ACH withdrawals take a couple days to post to your bank account, wire withdrawals are usually same day but have a higher fee.  Trading on the platform is instant, and depositing BTC will depend on your fee and how fast your transaction confirms; with a sufficiently high fee it should usually clear in under an hour.  So basically, if you have BTC on Gemini, you should be able to convert that to Dollars in your bank account within a couple days (or faster if you're willing to pay for the wire).  This is much the same for GDAX/Coinbase.
As far as a "backlog of exits", I don't think you need to worry about any backlog in ACH or wires; those are large systems easily able to handle any volume bitcoin will throw at it.  The exchanges themselves haven't had the best track record lately of staying up during high volume times (this goes for GDAX/Coinbase too), so that's a risk, and if you need to deposit your BTC onto the exchange during a time of network congestion, you'll have to pay a fee high enough to get it confirmed quickly (impossible to say in advance what that would be).

It's just a simple question of what a good block size limit is.  1MB was picked pretty arbitrarily, the odds that it represents an optimal  "sweet spot" are pretty low.  What do you think would be a better number (higher or lower is fine), or do you think it doesn't actually matter?  Would we be fine if it was 1KB instead of 1MB?  
You can make consensus-based counterarguments for why we shouldn't change the block size, but that's very different from making an engineering/economics argument for why 1MB is the right size.  A lot of people seem to be confusing arguments for the former as arguments for the latter.

The point being if people are investing their money, it's because they feel they can earn a better return than the risk free real rate.  You want to maximize the purchasing power of those people, and that's what everyone else hoarding their cash (rather than real resources) does.  Otherwise it by definition competes for real resources in the economy (raising the price level), and if they can't even produce a return as high as the natural rate, that's a *net negative* for the economy.  Those real resources were, on average, less productive than they would have otherwise been (the common misconception is that those real resources would otherwise go unused - not true, their price would simply be lower).  That's malinvestment and you don't want to incentivize it.

Of course all that is true.

I don't consider that a useful model.  That'd be true if the only way people "saved" was stuffing cash under a mattress, but no one does that.  In reality the wealthy have the best wealth management money can buy, and the whole point of that management is to park their wealth in yield-bearing assets - they're not just sitting thre eating the losses due to inflation.  Look at the massive asset price inflation of the last decade (that's where the effect of QE goes first) - if you're a rich person holding all your wealth in a bag of cash then it's been bad, but if you're holding equities/real estate instead then you're doing great.
It's actually the poor/middle class that are much more likely to have a significant portion of their savings (even if their net savings may be low) in cash or low interest accounts.  They don't have professional wealth management maximizing yield for them.  If you have the latter, inflation doesn't matter so much.  
If you think our monetary system is designed to serve the poor, I think you've been misled.  There's a lot of rhetoric that points that way but I've found it's almost universally untrue.  It's a system designed by and for the bankers, including the inflationary policies of the FED.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:37:00
I disagree.  Zero monetary inflation is the only way to properly express the time value of money, which is critically important to minimizing the over-expansion of the credit cycle, which in turn is critical to avoiding catastrophic credit collapses.  Deflation can be a confusing topic for people since it's both the symptom of a credit collapse, but also an important ingredient in preventing the inflation of the credit bubble in the first place.  It's also not nearly as big a departure from our current monetary system as people think - the real money in our current monetary system is sovereign debt (US debt in the US$ monetary system), and that debt pays a real return - in other words, it acts much the same as a deflationary store of value.  When we talk about the "Dollar reserves" of foreign CBs and other large institutions, you're talking mostly about US debt with yield (notes, treasuries, bonds).  You need that store of value function to anchor any monetary system really; otherwise it's not a competitive system.
Bitcoin can only "hyper-deflate" during the adoption phase.  If and when the adoption phase runs it's course, then deflation over the longer term will average around the rate of real economic growth of the underlying bitcoin-denominated economy.  If historical economic growth rates are an indicator, that would be something in the neighborhood of ~3.5% per year in real terms.

I'm quite optimistic about lightning network, but I'm actually not expecting it to reduce fees much; I actually think it's possible it will increase demand at the base layer due to the additional utility it brings to it.  The types of transactions lightning is most useful for are mostly already priced out of the blockchain, so any substitution affects might be minimal, and the additional utility provided by opening/closing channels would lead to more demand.  Additional utility is a good thing of course, but I think there should definitely be a discussion around block size adjustments and how to balance the priorities (cost of running a node vs cost of publishing to the blockchain).  
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:11:55

It's half the equation in supply/demand, so I'd say it's a pretty important part in how it works.  But yeah, there's the supply side of the equation too.  Both sides matter.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:42:25


So an important clarification to make here - I specified zero [*monetary* inflation]( - in other words, a fixed quantity of base money (no increase to base money supply).  When combined with a growing underlying economy, this would result in price deflation.
In macroeconomics, there's basically an open question over how central banks should target interest rates.  There are all sorts of theories how the natural rate of interest should be set (or if it should be set at all).  
I argue that the real rate of return of a fixed quantity base money (due to deflation) is the "optimal" rate of real risk free return.  Any yield below that *is not a net productive use of real resources*, as it would return *below* the natural rate of growth of the real economy.  It's better that some capital sit in virtual cash rather than compete for real resources that they will utilize suboptimally (hoarding cash results in cheaper real resources for those who will make better use of them).  A strong monetary store of value reduces the demand for real resources (real estate for example) as a store of value, which improves overall economic efficiency.  You want people buying a piece of real estate because they will make good use of it, not because they just need someplace to park some wealth.
The purpose of money ultimately is a coordination tool to help us allocate real resources, and in order for it to properly do that across the time dimension, it needs a fixed *supply* (not a fixed price level).  
And losses of bitcoin also contribute to the overall "cost" of owning bitcoin (if you want to eliminate the potential for loss you could insure, but that just realizes the cost) which offsets the deflationary "benefit" it has.  
As for your points about hyper-deflation, I basically agree bitcoin won't be very stable until it's well into the 7 figures.  But I'm confident it can be very stable if it's widely adopted enough (the rate of deflation will swing some with the business cycle in the way real interest rates do now).  
So yeah, I think speculation needs to take bitcoin well into 7 figures territory (inflation adjusted USD) for it to stabilize enough to be a useful unit of account.  No disagreement there.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:05:56
You're confusing symptoms with causes.  Deflation is a subtle topic.  If you think it's as simple as "deflation is bad" then I would argue you're not familiar with the nuance of the literature on the topic.  Deflation can be a result of healthy productivity growth, it can also be a result of disastrous credit contraction, or some combination in between. 
Besides, my main point is that the "money" that actual wealthy people use (including institutions like foreign CBs, private banks, sovereign wealth funds, etc.) is sovereign debt, not currency.  And it pays interest (albeit rates are at all time lows right now).  It works in much the same way as a deflationary monetary system.  Do you get what I'm saying here? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:35:29


Yes, this is what I'm referring to in terms of optimal growth rates.  I'm not sure why you think I'm arguing against anything you're saying here; the whole point of my optimal allocation of resources discussion is how to utilize them most efficiently and thus creating optimal growth.  
As far as anything regarding the great depression, you really can't compare a credit collapse and the resulting deflationary shock with anything I'm talking about (a deflationary-by-design-and-expectation monetary system).  Two completely different kinds of deflation; in terms of causes and effects.

Network effects, politics, developer support; community support; all these social factors matter a lot.  Money is a social construct.  If technical parameters of the underlying code were all that matters, I could just arbitrarily fork bitcoin (no real change, just force a fork) and they would all be "as good" as bitcoin technically.  Obviously that doesn't translate directly to value.
Personally, I think bcash, like a lot of altcoins, is going to eventually fall victim to the network effects of bitcoin ("core" if you'd like), and thus probably won't be a good long term investment; at least compared to bitcoin.  Just my opinion; if you disagree by all means keep it or buy more. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:57:46


What I can't understand is how someone can study that for 6-7 years and not realize that the current monetary system acts in much the same way as a deflationary monetary system (the market will not accept anything else).  It's just that the "money" in this system is interest paying sovereign debt, not currency.  The poor and the middle class bare the brunt of the inflation tax; but the wealthy always have their capital parked in the best quality yield money can buy.
The primary difference between the current system and a deflationary monetary system are all nominal, not real.  The latter is in fact much more egalitarian (it makes fair saving simple).

In the long term, sure.  But ideally their short term incentives should align with that as well.  Smaller miners in particular can act more selfishly without as much harm to the overall network due to their minimal overall influence, but if that behavior is more profitable then you have perverse incentives arising.  I think it's important to make sure that selfish mining is healthy mining, in both the short and long term.

Lump sum ASAP buying will have the highest expected return, but the argument for averaging in would be for risk management.  The right decision depends on your desired risk profile.
If you lump sum invest, your returns will be more dependent on your specific timing than if you average in.  On average the lump sum will be a better performer, but your downside risk is also higher and the marginal utility of money is why risk management matters.  Another way of looking at averaging in/out is insurance against timing (both good and bad).

"Change nothing" or "change everything" is a false dichotomy.  Some aspects people will be willing to change, others they will not.  Bitcoin can be viewed as representing and enforcing a monetary social contract.  I'd imagine things like the supply cap, inflation schedule, immutability, open access, and being censorship-free are properties that most people consider important parts of that contract.
I don't think that having SHA-256 as the proof of work is an important part of that contract, but that's just my opinion.  PoW algorithms are largely interchangeable in function; the only thing that matters is that the miners with the majority of that algo's hashpower are not colluding to abuse their power.  If they do, they deserve to get fired imo, but I imagine that the threat of being able to do so would be enough to keep it from ever happening (no miner wants their massive investment in SHA256 ASICS to become nothing more than heaters overnight).

He was talking about a potential monetary policy mechanism.  Bitcoin's is far simpler than anything he proposed - it's just fixed.  That's a super old idea, but one that didn't get talked about too much because it wasn't understood to be realistically possible before bitcoin.  It makes Nash's rather complicated proposals unnecessary, and if he thought it was possible he probably wouldn't have bothered coming up with far more complicated schemes to produce price stability (which isn't even the goal of bitcoin's monetary policy, as its wild fluctuations in value make quite obvious).
Again, I don't see much relation other than some favor for sound money principles, which Nash is hardly alone in having.  The flavor of sound money between bitcoin and Nash's ideal money is quite different (fixed supply vs a commodity basket).

This is the exact misconception I was talking about, and no, I do not agree at all.  Money does not generate wealth, the efficient use of real resources does - the only question is how money can assist in the optimal allocation of real resources (again, money is just a coordination tool, and should not be confused with a real resource itself).  If money is hoarded, that *does not* mean that real resources go unused, it just means their price levels are lower.  Do you follow up to that point at least?  The real resources will get used, they just might get used by someone else, and at a lower price, and I'm arguing that the latter will lead to a more optimal allocation of resources compared to a system lacking a strong deflationary store of value, because lacking that you create incentives to invest in yields below the natural rate, which is a net drag on the economy.  It's not "more spending = more growth", it's "optimal spending = optimal growth", and I believe hoarding (i.e. saving) is a key facet in avoiding suboptimal spending; i.e. malinvestment.
@_date: 2015-12-02 02:02:34
The last resort defense against 51% attacks would be for the rest of the network (at least the people opposed to the 51% attack) to move to a different proof-of-work algorithm.  It's a pretty simple change code-wise, and proof-of-work algorithms are basically interchangeable - there's nothing particularly special about SHA256; scrypt or some cpu-friendly algorithm can work just as well.  You snapshot the blockchain state at the point where the attack begins, then hard fork it to a new proof of work.  If the economic majority follows that fork then the value will follow as well.
It'd certainly be an unpleasant experience and there would be a significant hit to valuation (at least temporarily), but I highly doubt it would actually kill bitcoin, and if it does survive such an attack (albeit with some significant temporary inconveniences) then the resulting confidence in the network could be even higher than before since it has demonstrated it can deal with a 51% attack.  Once it successfully deals with one, the incentive to perform another is significantly diminished.
Obviously this is all speculation, but that's how I see it playing out if it ever came to that.

I mean, I guess I'll have to agree to disagree that this has much to do with bitcoin.  Even from a monetary policy standpoint, bitcoin's monetary policy is incredibly simple, and far from a novel idea - it's ultimately just a fixed supply.  That's an idea as old as money itself, the only hard part was figuring out a system that could potentially make it a reality, since no physical commodity has a practical limit (we could always find/mine more) and central issuers were far too corruptible to be expected to enforce a fixed supply.
Nash isn't really talking about anything that a bunch of austrian economists hadn't already thought about.  He himself mentioned that his views seem to overlap quite a bit with Hayek's (whom I have a ton of respect for as well).  I'm not trying to downplay the guy's contributions to the world, of which there are plenty, I just don't think they're as directly relevant to bitcoin as you're implying.  He's mostly talking about monetary policy mechanisms and bitcoin's is dead simple and not at all a novel idea; the novelty is in the execution, and the execution of cryptocurrency is something that as far as I can tell Nash didn't really contribute to at all, unless you count some very early contributions to cryptography.

The "I am not Dorian Nakamoto" message may have been the real Satoshi, no way to know for sure.  It was posted on his [P2P foundation account]( to the thread where he announced bitcoin v0.1.  The account wasn't known to be hacked (*edit* - er, at the time of that post at least, see reply), and no other messages since.  Pretty sure he used tor to access it, so no meaningful IP info.

The current hash rate (or rather the money spent providing it) is essentially a direct result of price multiplied by subsidy. It's not based on "security needs" in the slightest, so it's hard to say whether the network is currently over, under, or properly secured relative to its current value (since no one has bothered to cobble together enough hash power to attack it, I suppose that's a modest indication that it's not under secured). I suspect it's quite over secured, but that's just me.  The biggest threat so far has been mining pool centralization, which is an independent factor of total hash rate of the network. It's probably not over secured by 1000x though.

If Szabo's involved, it's pretty likely he collaborated with at least one other developer.  In April 08 he published a blog post about bitgold markets and asked in the comments if anyone wanted to help him code up bitgold (which was already very similar in concept to bitcoin).  My money's on one or more people taking him up on that offer (his two bitgold blog posts had their date changed at some point to Dec 08, but they were published in 2005 and April 2008).  Also the fact that it's not cited in the whitepaper is suspicious considering just how similar the concepts are (it's unlikely whoever made bitcoin was unaware of bitgold).

I understand, I'm just not worried that wallet providers will start adding that by default anytime soon for the reasons you stated.  If someone *chooses* to use RBF in a 0-confirm situation then they're just letting you know they're trying to scam you; there's little lost in rejecting that transaction (or just waiting until it confirms).  If the option is selected by mistake/misunderstanding then that's a UI/education problem; certainly something that can be addressed.
I'm sure that most wallet providers understand the value of zero confirm transactions and aren't trying to unnecessarily break them either.

The odds don't factor in their 2% cut and they are only estimates since the final odds will depend on the final bet distribution (the odds shown only reflect the current bet distribution).  It's a very different model than a traditional sports book (onehash doesn't take on any risk and odds are completely user dependent), but the model itself checks out imo (can't say beyond that whether or not it's a scam obviously).  I've actually been curious if any sportsbooks followed something like this model, so thanks OP for bringing it to my attention.  I was thinking more of a user vs user maker/taker model to remove the uncertainty, but this is nonetheless interesting.
If the soccer odds are throwing you off, make sure to take into account that ties are a third outcome you can bet on as well.  If you look at a sport with binary outcomes the odds should look more familiar (albeit they're still a little too good to be true since they don't take into account the 2% cut; what they're showing are perfect odds).  2% vig is hard to beat though.

That's why I'd be really surprised if any popular wallet software would enable it by default anytime soon; they care about their user experience too and getting denied 0-confirm transactions when you're expecting it to work is not a good user experience.  
RBF does have its utility - it's plainly the most efficient way to optimize fees if you're not worried about zero confirms, for example.  I think opt-in was the right solution for now, so that it can be phased in where appropriate and left out where it's not by people who care about their user experience (merchant/wallet providers).
It seems like a good payment protocol could go a long ways towards improving the user experience, zero confirm or not (the payment protocol could take care of the transaction configuration to make sure it's optimized for your desired purposes).

It doesn't make much sense to me to separate security from transaction processing.  IMO security is one component of transaction processing.  To think otherwise is putting the cart before the horse.  Processing a transaction insecurely is not that same thing (and doesn't have the same value) as processing it securely, so imo the true cost of a bitcoin transaction includes the cost to secure it.
The only purpose of the blockchain is to write data ("process transactions" for a monetary ledger) to a secure public ledger.  All the costs work towards producing that output, including security.   If security had some purpose other than that, then I could see your point... but it doesn't.
It seems we agree regarding the problem of projecting based on this metric, but I don't really agree with you that it's a 100% wrong way to look at it; I think there are perspectives from which it is a valid, albeit not particularly useful observation.

It sounds simple in theory but in practice would be complex, and complex is bad since it's hard to predict and prone to attack/failure.  The main issue that jumps out at me is that there's no consensus on what the "backlog" really is.  The backlog is by definition the transactions that haven't yet been included in consensus, i.e. a block.  Every node has their own independent backlog based on what transactions they've seen, so wherever you decide to draw the line between an acceptable block and not (based on relation to "backlog"), you risk causing some nasty consensus issues since nodes will always have some variance around that line.  Picking where exactly that line should be is problematic as well.

It's just a weak form of the quantity theory of money based on the fisher equation, MV=PY.  I call it a weak form since I don't assume velocity is constant, but rather operates within a band.  Since M is constant (fixed supply of BTC) and V drifts within a band but is ultimately constrained by the practical realities of economic activity, over the long term you expect the price level (P) to move roughly inversely with the real output of the economy (Y).  In other words, deflation (the inverse of the rate of change of the price level) loosely follows real economic growth, at least over the long term. 
Deflationary spirals are a rather misleading way of describing a rapid deleveraging event.  They don't go on forever, and they only can happen dramatically if you start from a severely over-leveraged position in the first place.  They stop when smart people realize money is being overvalued, because the smart thing to do when money is overvalued is to spend it... unless you think it's going to be increasingly and increasingly overvalued ad infinitum, in which case imho you are not a very smart person (I'm speaking generally here, not specifically to you).  A "deflationary spiral" that goes on past the point of healthy deleveraging is simply an unsustainable bubble in the price of money, and unsustainable bubbles pop sooner or later.


I was worried I didn't make that point very clearly - I wasn't intending to imply that the example is a misallocation of resources (more so the opposite, actually).  The "misallocation" comment was meant to stand alone, which wasn't clear from the context.  The point of the example was to demonstrate that loans in a bitcoin economy wouldn't look that different than they do now as long as you account for real values vs nominal, since regardless of the monetary system, people naturally try to avoid unproductive loans.  
Real interest rates would probably be slightly higher in a bitcoin economy (lower in nominal terms), probably by a percent or two.  If you think we have a bad habit of over-incentivising credit expansion in our current monetary regime (tends to happen when your solution to an abundance of bad credit is more credit), then a bit higher real rates on average would be quite healthy.
On that note, the idea that stuffing money under a mattress has no productive effect on the economy is completely false.  It's no different than a distributed loan to the entire economy, and if that economy is growing and therefore you have deflation, then you earn a real return (zero nominal of course) on that loan.  It's similar in concept to how losing/burning coins is in the long term similar in effect to donating them to all other coin holders (proportionally to their holdings), since money taken out of circulation is no longer competing for real resources with their own.  The only difference with a mattress stuffer is that they only "lose" their coins temporarily - at some point they take them back by digging them out of the mattress.  Like collecting on a loan.

His solution was relatively novel (thought he himself admitted it was pretty similar to Hayek's views), and *very distinct from bitcoin's solution*.  That's my point.  Bitcoin's solution is far simpler, and Nash probably didn't propose it since he (like everyone else at the time) didn't think it was actually possible.
Again, bitcoin's monetary policy is just a fixed supply.  That has very little to do with what Nash proposed, and if you can't see that perhaps you don't understand what he was talking about?  Bitcoin's monetary policy doesn't give two shits about price stability, which was pretty clearly one of Nash's main goals with his proposal.  They're really apples and oranges...

Merge mining would probably be the most secure approach if the fork remains on the same algorithm (even that isn't a strict requirement or anything).  I'm not sure why you say "this would not be the case" - are you referring to this specific fork (in which case I agree - with the changes being discussed, both forks remaining viable is extraordinarily unlikely) or just in general?  You could also include difficulty resets or a more responsive difficulty algorithm in the fork, if we're just talking possibilities.
We know from altcoins that having less hashing power on the same hashing algorithm as another coin isn't an automatic death sentence or anything, but more of a looming security risk.  As long as there is a community using the smaller fork and giving it value, there's no reason why it has to die.  You might wonder who would do such a thing, to which I'd point out all the altcoins that stubbornly persist despite tiny market share.  A fork is technically no different than an altcoin with the initial distribution being bootstrapped by the current state of bitcoin.

If someone tried to lock in 1-2% yearly supply inflation in the coming decade, then I agree that's what would happen.  
Personally I don't think it'd be sacrilege to freeze the block reward sometime post 2050 at around .01% new supply a year or less if we come to realize that the network security model works better with a mix of a small subsidy alongside fees rather than pure fees alone.  The effect of .01% monetary inflation on bitcoin's store of value proposition is pretty much negligible imo.  Of course, there could be enough people who would flip their shit at the prospect to make it unpalatable, but the way I look at it is the network has some cost to operate and secure and we can either pay for it through transaction fees or a subsidy or a mix of both.  No free lunch in either case, it just affects how much of the cost of running the network is covered by savers (through devaluation of savings through subsidy issuance) vs spenders (transaction fees), and we all have a foot in both camps to varying degrees.  Since both camps derive utility from bitcoin, I don't think it'd be unreasonable to split the costs between both, with spenders paying the lion's share since they consume more network resources than savers, but anyways that's a discussion for 35+ years from now imo.  If it looks like things will work fine with pure transaction fees, then no need to change anything.

I agree the block size is an easy concept to grasp on to, but I disagree that the pros and cons are very clear, unless you have a very over-simplified view of the pros and cons.

I'd quibble a bit there and rephrase it as saying it just increases the leverage of the attacker.

Doubling the multiplier would double the affect they can have, I agree with that.  It's a balance, like all things.

What is the advantage of having a mining chip over preloading with BTC ?  As you admitted, the ASIC will not turn a profit, meaning the cost of generating the satoshis will exceed the value of the satoshis.  So why not just buy them rather than mine them?
If you want a "stream" of BTC then 21 can just provide you a stream rather than preloading all up front.  The mining portion just seems like a roundabout and inefficient way to accomplish a simple goal - have some btc on the device.
I'm fine with the device otherwise - I think a small, standardized bitcoin friendly computer is a nice plaything for developers (even if all that really is here is a raspberry pi with some custom software).  It's just the mining portion that doesn't make any sense, and if I had to guess it's just their way of squeezing the last bit of profit out of no longer profitable mining chips.

Neither side can present a cogent, technical explanation for "how much decentralization" is sufficient to maintain bitcoins fundamental value proposition - censorship and regulation resistance stemming from its decentralized nature.  I think we all agree that it's important.  Without that quality bitcoin has no advantages (plenty of disadvantages in fact) over a centralized database.  
Neither side has posed much of a cogent, technical explanation regarding decentralization and how much/what type of decentralization is sufficient, because *there's no obvious way to do so*.  Assuming you think decentralization is important, you should realize this is a limitation on both sides of the argument, not just one.  If it was something easily definable in technical terms, there probably wouldn't be nearly as much instinctive disagreement.
I'd love to see someone try to quantify in a technical and objective way how much decentralization is sufficient to maintain bitcoin's core value proposition.  I don't care if the conclusion is pro or anti block-size increase, I just want to see people try so they appreciate the inherent difficulty in doing so, since this is important regardless of which side of the debate you fall on.  My main frustration in this debate is with people on either side who think that their opinion regarding sufficient/insufficient decentralization is anything more than an opinion.  It certainly isn't anything resembling a science.

I think a better way to describe it that holds up more generally is that miners are motivated by profit, and whether or not that directly motivates small blocks or large blocks depends on the trade off of the profitability of including transaction fees vs the risk of orphaning due to slower propagation.

If they openly said they did it, would it be ok (I think it's in the terms of service at least)?  Because then anyone who's using it obviously is ok with being spied on, so who's the victim?  Like I said, they can't spy on you if you don't use them, so don't.  Problem solved, no?  Are they still bothering you somehow?
The fact is bitcoin would be a lot less useful to me without circle/coinbase since I don't see any alternatives (for btc-&gt;fiat exchanging, I don't use them for wallets) that are better.  Localbitcoins would be inconvenient as hell to have to use all the time and the "de-centralized" exchanges haven't really materialized yet.  I know they're watching, so I don't use them for anything I wouldn't want them to see.  I don't see how them going away would be an improvement to this situation, it seems pretty clearly the opposite to me.  If there's one thing I'd like them to do differently, it's to be more open and clear about what they watch and how, but I also know that's pretty much a no-no for AML compliance stuff since you aren't supposed to tell people your exact tactics because it would be aiding their circumvention.  That's the law unfortunately, and I don't blame circle/coinbase for the law, or for following it while trying to operate a business (one that I actually find useful for certain purposes even!).

Again, that's not the type of vulnerability being discussed here.  What you're referring to is a completely different topic, and no, I have no examples of someone doing that, nor do I believe it's much of a problem.
We're not talking about agencies trying to bust people by falsely linking them to bad actors, we're talking about agencies spamming dust transactions to a lot of addresses in an attempt to help deanonymize the owners of the addresses.  I don't feel the need to provide an example of someone doing this to prove that it works; I'm confident anyone with sufficient understanding of the protocol will agree that it's possible.  Besides, you can't really prove someone is doing this, all you'd see is spam on the network, which there is if you look.  Most people who've used bitcoin for a while have probably been the recipient of some satoshi spam at one time or another, but again you can't prove the intent of the spam.  There are companies like coinvalidation out there, it wouldn't be surprising if this was one of their tools.

I'm all for increasing the block size, but the obvious counterargument here imo is that unless you're planning on bitcoin blocks always outpacing demand for transactions (I don't think any of the prominent voices on this topic believe that will happen), it wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing to learn how to deal with block space scarcity now rather than later, since we aren't going to REALLY know what will happen until it goes live (I understand you can study/simulate/plan your ass off, but the proof is ultimately in the pudding).  You could still increase the block size a bit later after gaining some real-world insight into how the network responds to approaching capacity.  Yes it's an unknown, but it's an unknown that most people agree needs to be dealt with eventually, and it's easy to argue why sooner might be a better time to deal with it.
I suppose the trade off here is that the longer you wait, the higher the stakes become (assuming bitcoin continues to grow), but the more time you have to study the problem and plan for solutions.  Which is the right approach is again quite a subjective evaluation, so it's understandable that there would be people on both sides of that argument.
@_date: 2015-06-04 05:43:50
I think that's a bit of an unfair example since you're exploiting an edge case of how medians work when there's no real variance in the data.  If the 73 blocks were an average of 1.1MB *but not all exactly 1.1MB*, then the 71 empty blocks most certainly do affect the resulting median, because in effect they're shifting the median to the 2 smallest blocks in the 1.1MB average set, which you would expect to be smaller than 1.1MB for a set with any variance.
Having said all that, after running through the mean vs median scenarios, I believe they're not actually significantly different.  In both cases minority participants do have a degree of influence, but it's limited (they can bias the block size up or down, but by a limited amount, they can't make it go up or down indefinitely).  
For example, when using the mean with a "natural" average block size of 1MB, an "attacker" (or manipulator) with 10% hash power who wants to raise the block size could spam 2MB blocks, resulting in a mean of 1.1MB and a new block limit of 2.2MB.  If the other 90% of the network continues to publish 1 MB blocks (since that's the "natural" average) and the attacker spams 2.2MB blocks, then at the next update the mean is now 1.12 for a max of 2.24.  Repeat again and you get a mean of 1.124 and a max of 2.248.  Again and it's 1.1248/2.2496.  This limits at a max block size of 2.25MB.  If you do the analysis using a median, the magnitude of the resulting affect will depend on the variance of the "honest" block set (since what you're doing is basically shifting the position of the median within the remaining "honest" set), but the influence is also limited (you only have to do one iteration of the thought experiment for the median case to reach steady state).

I completely agree with you regarding the desire to engineer your systems such that the potential for tyrannical abuses by the majority are limited.  The point that I stubbornly keep repeating is that the threat of tyranny of the majority is not a good reason to avoid using majority mechanisms to drive consensus, since it's the least bad solution we have, and I feel that bitcoin is a good example of that.

Can you clarify?  I couldn't make sense of your comment.  Just for a brief recap in case there was a misunderstanding, someone sends dust to an address, the owner of that address merges that dust with some of their other inputs when sending out a transaction, you've now linked the addresses used as inputs for that transaction.  By spamming dust to a lot of addresses, you can start to do this en masse.  Proper coin control can combat this.

I think there are a lot of people who aren't core devs who are more than capable of understanding this topic and forming an opinion on it.  Being a core dev implies a certain degree of comfort with the nitty gritty of the bitcoin code, but this debate is about a much more theoretical topic than code.  It should be pretty clear from the type of arguments being made by both sides (pro or con) that this isn't a highly technical topic from a coding perspective, and the divide is based more in ideology than anything else.  The main argument against it - that the potential increase in resource requirements for nodes/miners would lead to more centralization - has absolutely nothing to do with code.
While I agree that it's good to weigh the opinions of people based on their expertise (particularly when you yourself lack expertise), I think you're being too narrow with the group of people who qualify.  This isn't the type of topic where coding expertise means much.  It's more about game theory, politics, and human behavior, with some IT thrown in.  
There's a lot of bright folks in the bitcoin space who've dedicated a lot of time to understanding the ecosystem.  I think their opinions are just as valid as the core devs since this isn't a particularly technical topic, at least by bitcoin standards.

A basic example would be broadcasting two transactions that use the same input but pay to different outputs.  Both of them are "valid" unconfirmed transactions, but only one will be included in a block (not both, which is what I was trying to point out above).  If you're accepting 0-confirm transactions, there's a risk that the transaction you accepted as valid will not be the one mined in a block.

They certainly can, I was just trying to point out the futility of trying to define which one is the altcoin or not.

It will be eventually, when block rewards are mostly transaction fees.  In the highly inflationary early days of bitcoin, it's just going to be price times the predetermined inflation rate, hence why it's probably oversecured to all hell right now relative to the size of the bitcoin market.  The mistake critics make is in assuming it's going to remain that way.

You can call it a lose-lose and I'd agree, but totally busted and useless, in an absolute sense?  That's an exaggeration, is it not?  
A battle between a slight majority/minority is usually a lose-lose situation in good old fashioned power struggles as well (see the devastation caused to both sides in any pretty evenly fought war), although they still happen too often in history since the decision makers on the winning side can usually insulate themselves from the downsides (which is a system design issue, and I agree with you that bitcoin represents some good improvements in this area).  
Again, my main point for the statement I made was that the threat of tyranny of the majority is not a valid reason to avoid using majority-something as your consensus mechanism, as I thought sinnycal was implying.  Maybe you interpreted his statement differently, but my comment was definitely meant to be read in context of what he said, not in isolation.

I'm not so sure.  I know the gold/silver ratio is quite high atm so some people are expecting a reversion to the mean, but I wouldn't be surprised if it continues to grow higher.  I highly doubt precious metals will ever go back to physically circulating as currency in coin form (it's just too inefficient compared to electronic alternatives), but they could have a future as a store of value/monetary base - but in that case, gold does the job just fine.  Silver held its monetary utility alongside gold from the practical realities of metal coins (trying to buy a jar of milk with gold is not practical, you'd have to pay a few milligrams, and that's why silver and copper have historically had persistent monetary uses alongside gold).  If all it's being used for is a store of value or a monetary base, then gold alone is fine since you don't need the kind of granularity you need for circulating currency.  It's possible silver is in the process of being slowly but surely demonetized.  Just my 2 grams.
*edit* - if you're going to downvote, can someone offer a counterargument?  I'm curious what arguments there are that don't rely on:
* precious metal coins circulating as currency again
* the benefits of silver as a commodity (that's fine, but I'm talking about its monetary uses)
* neglecting the convergent tendencies of money (1 form of money is better than 2 if all else is equal)
I have a bit of a stash of silver from before I held this opinion, so I wouldn't mind if I'm wrong.  I'm beholden to reason though, so I'd prefer to hear reasonable counterarguments.

Let's say I know of an address associated with you.  I send that address a tiny amount of BTC.  Later on, you need to send someone some BTC, so your wallet automatically rounds up some inputs to fund the transaction.  One of those inputs is the tiny amount I sent you earlier.  I now know you control the other addresses used as inputs in that transaction as well.  
If I spam these tiny transactions to a lot of addresses and watch them, you can start linking together lots of addresses which assists deanonymization.

No protection is perfect, but pickpocketing is so prevalent because it's relatively safe for the thief.  Armed robbery of pedestrians gets you pretty much the same reward as pickpocketing but with a ton more risk for the perp, since it's both confrontational (unlike pickpocketing) and a much more serious crime (increased legal risks).  A solution resistant to pickpocketing is still worthwhile even though it may not be a solution to armed robbery.

I'm pretty sure the annoying part of that was that their currency was being rampantly devalued, not so much the inconvenience of having to move a decimal point.

I guess that explains the confusion then. I was just talking about the procedures Coinbase uses to meet their customers' desires, and whether or not those procedures need to involve bitcoin or not. In the case where both sender and receiver are Coinbase users and both want to deal only with fiat, then bitcoin is unnecessary. That's what I was trying to say, and I believe those conditions represent a minority of transactions involving Coinbase.
I guess the key here is that "needs" has to be qualified in order to have a reasonable discussion, otherwise we can follow that rabbit hole all the way past food and water to the point where we're having a philosophical discussion over whether we even need to live.  My qualification for "need" is in order for Coinbase to meet their customer demands.

How would those with a "head start" make money off of that?  Bitcoins move between the chains pegged 1:1.  It doesn't matter if you move to the other chain first or last, you still have 1 "new" bitcoin for every "old" bitcoin you moved over regardless of when you do it.  And since bitcoins are freely convertible and fungible between chains, there's no reason for any price divergence to occur between the chains.  What is the profit mechanism you're referring to?

I'll agree that it's better than holding a collapsing fiat.  I'm just not sure if it belongs in the same category as bitcoin/gold, which imo are mainly valued for their monetary purposes, or in the same category as land, ammo, etc, which are valued for their physical utility.

Again, that's all about monetary policy mechanisms.  A paper on bitcoin's monetary policy would be two words long - "fixed supply".  Nash did not come up with that; people have probably desired a money with that property for as long as money has been a thing.  Nash proposed ways to form an ideal monetary policy with the limitations of the world as he knew it - bitcoin changed those limitations, and it did so through a clever architecture that Nash certainly didn't predict.  
The hard part was figuring out how to make it work, and there's nothing I've seen Nash write that has anything to do with how cryptocurrency makes a fixed money supply a reality - he's writing about ways to deal with the fact that such a thing didn't exist.  I'm not sure what to say other than my reading of everything he's wrote (including the things you're quoting) is what leads to my viewpoint.

That's mainly true if the forks are very similar in the utility that they provide, but if the difference is substantial it's possible that the "smaller" fork would still have unique utility which would give it value, and as long as there is value there will be miners since difficulty adjusts.  For example, if someone forked bitcoin tomorrow and made some significant changes (stuff like strong anonymity or whatever else you can imagine), it's possible that both forks would remain due to the differences in utility.  You could look at it as a way to bootstrap an altcoin, and we all know already that altcoins can exist with varying degrees of success.
For a change like the one we're looking at (block size limits), I agree that it's highly unlikely you would be left with two viable forks since it's not a significant utility change to the end user (at least not in the present).

Names will be whatever people choose to use.  If the majority of the market goes with the new chain and still calls it "bitcoin" and "BTC", that's what it's going to be, at least in practice.  You can argue that that's wrong but the majority will overrule the minority through pure influence.

That's one way to deal with it, the other would be allowing a bit larger multiplier (say 3x or 4x) instead of 2x to better handle short term surges in demand (as well as quicker recovery after an unusually large delay between blocks) and let the overall block size limit changes only address long term trends.  In both cases, the real limiting factor is whether the underlying infrastructure can actually handle that increased load, so you'd want to be conservative imo with letting the network scale up too far too fast.
Just for some perspective here, a multiplier of 2x average would actually shrink the current block size limit to around .8-.9MB.  We already see full blocks here and there, particularly after an inordinately long gap between blocks.  A 2x multiplier in the present would actually worsen the backlog we get from time to time when there's a long gap between blocks.  Not sure we want to move in that direction.  In effect, we have a multiplier right now of ~2.5 with the current averages and block size limit.  The lower that number goes, the more backlog you get when transactions spike or blocks lag.  There's no "right" number here but I personally think the goldylocks zone might be more around 3 or 4.

Loans will happen if the expected real return on the loan exceeds the expected deflationary rate of bitcoin.  Since the long term rate of deflation under a global bitcoin economy would roughly converge with the rate of real growth of the underlying economy, you can rephrase the former as saying that loans will happen if the expected real return on the loan exceeds the expected real growth of the economy.  
That's exactly as it should be unless you're a fan of misallocating resources.  For some perspective, in our current monetary system (this isn't exact but let's assume ~2% real GDP growth and ~2% inflation), in order for a loan to have an expected real return exceeding the real growth of the economy, the nominal rate would have to be &gt;4%.  That's actually pretty close to the current reality - a 30 year mortgage right now carries a nominal rate of around 4%.  
It's important to remember that in a deflationary monetary system, *any* positive nominal rate is a positive real rate, even nominal rates &lt;1%.  A 1% nominal rate loan isn't particularly viable in an inflationary monetary system since it'd most likely return a negative real rate, but it is viable in a deflationary one (assuming it's a low risk loan - as always, higher risk demands higher rates).

And reddit assigns permission to the moderators to moderate their subreddits.  This is absolutely a form of private property.  Again, don't confuse public access with public property, and just because the moderators don't own the place, it doesn't mean they aren't delegated their powers by those who do.  If reddit wanted to remove Theymos as mod of then they obviously can.


No disagreements there.  I just don't think invoking the "principles of bitcoin" as they relate to the protocol level (decentralization, censorship resistance, open access, etc.) makes sense when discussing the moderation of a privately owned discussion forum.  The principles of the bitcoin protocol that you're referencing are applicable to the internet at the TCP/IP level - that should absolutely be open and censorship resistant.  Another principle of bitcoin is absolute control over your private property, and we'll have to agree to disagree if you don't think reddit qualifies as such.
I think your complaint is pretty straight forward - you don't like the moderation for your stated reasons.  It's certainly a fairly popular complaint at the moment.  I think trying to invoke protocol values to the moderation of a privately owned community is a misplaced argument, however.

I think the fact that upvotes/downvotes affect the sorting order is where most of the general gains (far from perfect, I agree) to signal/noise ratio come from.  I'm not sure showing scores helps more than it hurts.  A lot of the subreddits I frequent already had scores hidden so I guess I'm used to it, imo they tend to have a better signal/noise ratio in general.  Hivemind is a real phenomenon; hiding scores helps prevent some of that without taking away the benefits of vote-based sorting.

That's a good example of why I consider silver more of an industrial commodity and gold a monetary one.  The primary demand for gold is as a store of value (especially if you include jewelry as a store of value, as it's generally treated in many eastern cultures where gold jewelry is most prevalent, i.e. india china).  The majority of the demand for silver, as you pointed out, is industrial.
IMO ideal money has zero industrial utility, since you don't want your useful real resources tied up in use as a physical representation of an accounting ledger.  Having an industrial commodity serve a monetary role also means that the value of savings can fluctuate based on changes in industrial demand of a specific commodity, which is less than ideal - value of money should be independent of any specific industrial demand.  Hence why I like bitcoin, but as far as traditional assets go, gold is the best fit, and in a world where metals don't need to actually circulate as physical coins, I don't really see a monetary role for silver.
@_date: 2015-12-20 23:55:30


Basically every single Austrian economist has that view.  A lot of them thought that gold would be the commodity to do it.  Bitcoin is a new challenger on that front, and it doesn't seem that Nash foresaw the emergence of this type of commodity, otherwise he wouldn't have been talking about industrial commodity baskets.


Not sure how I'm fooled since I recognized that possibility when I first read about bitcoin in 2010, and that's why I'm here.  I was already an avid student of money at that point so the potential implications were crystal clear.
I'm only contending that Nash's ideal money proposal is not nearly as similar to bitcoin as you're implying.  The main similarity is in that both Nash and Satoshi (and a million other non-keynesian economists) believe in sound money principles, which can often be enforced through ties to commodities of various kinds to remove political influence. 
The biggest discrepancy is Nash's focus on price stability, which you've highlighted through various quotes here and there.  Bitcoin does not give any shits about price stability; it's shamelessly volatile as all hell.  In that respect Nash would call it far from ideal if you believe what he wrote.

Well if you understand how it works you know that's not necessarily the odds you'll actually end up at, so I wouldn't say it's "unfair" (the payouts are fair in the sense that the winning betters get the entire pot paid out proportionally to their bets, minus 2% house cut).  It does add a lot of uncertainty though, which is why I thought user vs user bets would be better arranged in a maker/taker sort of way (offer up odds and others can choose to take the other side).  That adds an extra step though; this way is simpler but like you said you don't really know what the final odds will be when you're betting.  I'm guessing a lot of people wait til the last minute to bet for that reason.

I'm not arguing it's not useful as a commodity.  I'm just not sure it belongs in the same category as bitcoin/gold, which are primarily valued for their monetary utility.

Yes, but the cost for a 51% attack (or any attack using hashrate as a resource) would plunge as well (at least once the mining industry adjusts to the new equilibrium), so what you're losing is that form of security.  You're comparing apples to oranges in that case (a very expensive to attack network vs a very cheap one).  If you want to assume the same amount of hashrate based security, but paid for by transactions fees instead of block rewards, then you get his number.  I'm highlighting the fact that this assumption has questionable utility, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it has none.
@_date: 2015-06-30 05:29:50
It's a complicated topic, and the gold market is so opaque that all you really have are theories with little verifiable data to actually back anything up.  One such theory is that the price of "gold" is set by gold derivatives, i.e. paper gold, which isn't actually a safe haven at all due to counter party risk, and only serves as an "inflation hedge" to the extent that the market views it as such.  If promises to deliver on gold ever fail to actually deliver, you would see a divergence between the price of gold derivatives and actual physical gold, with the former crashing and the latter rising.
I personally don't think physical gold has lost its safe haven status.  In the long term bitcoin is certainly an interesting proposition and has more than a few potential advantages over gold, but safe havens aren't made overnight and in the current world gold is still the gold standard.

I thought you were talking about the degree to which reddit's voting system (which is basically a democratic model) is a representation of comment quality that should be respected by moderators.  Your comment:


Is that not what you meant?  As for your point about me confusing bitcoin with not sure how you arrive there considering I pointed out there are alternative forums for discussing bitcoin (with their own moderators and rules) and we can vote with our feet.  If anyone's trying to apply the mechanisms of an open protocol to a privately owned discussion forum (that's what reddit is, open to the public is not the same thing as public) it's you.  It's apples and oranges, just like I doubt you run an open and censorship free home.  Open access and censorship resistance is a value of bitcoin at the protocol level, but total control of what you do with your private property is a value of bitcoin as well (the latter is actually empowered by the former).
Open access and censorship resistance are important values at the protocol level - like the internet, for example.  That doesn't mean individual, privately owned communities on the internet should necessarily be open and censorship free as well - people should be free to run them as they see fit.  You can in turn pick whichever community suits you or even start your own.

Again, I tried to emphasize that it's about *degrees* of deanonymization, so I completely agree that you won't just magically reveal everyone by doing this; it's just a tool that helps along with other blockchain forensics/traditional methods.  Glad we can agree on that much.  


There is plenty of unsolicited spam on the network, I've seen it in my own wallets and many others.  What might it be motivated by?  Like I said, there are companies like coinvalidation who's mission is to help companies comply with KYC/AML requirements.  What kind of stuff do you think they might do?  I certainly don't expect them to come out and say their methods openly, but I think it's a safe assumption blockchain forensics is a part of it, and the behavior we're describing here is basically an active form of blockchain forensics.  By spamming addresses, you increase the odds that the address will be merged with others, thus giving you more information.  It's a way to artificially increase the amount of merging that goes on, and merging is a privacy leak.

What doesn't make any sense is people using a bubble in bitcoin as some sort of a sign of "the death/end of bitcoin".

I agree with all that, but would still point out that the very nature of consensus is that one solution will prevail over others, and generally that solution will be determined by a majority of *something*.  Letting the minority rule isn't exactly a better solution, and something has to rule protocol-wise if you want to achieve consensus.  Some sort of majority arrangement seems to be the least bad solution we can come up with, and that's fine.
In other words, "tyranny of the majority" isn't imo an argument against some sort of majority rule, but rather a friendly reminder to try not to be a tyrant just because your position is the majority, or to try to engineer your systems such that the potential for tyranny is limited (this is where bitcoin does a pretty good job, as you pointed out).  But as far as consensus goes, I don't believe there's a better solution than converging on a majority of something or another, so opposing majority rule on the basis of the potential for a tyranny of the majority (which is how I interpreted Sinnycal's comment that I originally replied to) is imo an unproductive position as it doesn't offer a better alternative.

I addressed that here:


If you're selecting RBF for a transaction that you want accepted with zero confirms then that's clearly a mistake/misunderstanding.  I think wallet providers will be pretty conscious of trying to avoid this scenario since they care about their user experience too.  Proper UI and newb-friendly defaults go a long ways towards addressing this; a simple payment protocol would basically make it a non-issue.

I can relate to both sides of this argument.  Block rewards + transaction fees basically pay for the hashrate, and hashrate provides a form of security (raises the resource threshold required for an attacker).  Eventually the hashrate will have to be supported by transaction fees, so it is valid to say that "in order to maintain the current hashrate without block rewards, transaction fees would need to be X".  In that sense, yes, that's the current "cost" of the network per transaction.
The question is how useful of a hypothetical that really is, because in reality you don't want to subsidize any more hashrate than is "necessary" to keep the network running smoothly, and no one really knows where that point is, and with the way early block rewards work, we haven't even really started looking for that point as there's been no need.  That's going to be the main factor in determining what the "cost" of the bitcoin network ends up being.  Projecting out the current costs which are basically just determined by the value of new bitcoin issuance doesn't really say a whole lot as the cost is being driven by demand for bitcoin (price) rather than the need for hashrate, which is what will eventually drive it.
So while I agree with your observation, I also agree with others that it's an observation of pretty limited use for the reasons I explained above.  It's interesting, but lots of grains of salt to take with it.

So after two months of investigation, the most "substantial" thing to come out of it is he said/she said.
Other than that, pretty much all her investigation turned up is the he's an old retired engineer with the birthname Satoshi Nakamoto.  Without the supposed "admission", there's no story here.

Probably not many, but fortunately there's basically zero problem with accepting zero confirm transactions for such small amounts.  It's not even worth the effort it would take to try to double spend just to save a few cents.  
The real reason we probably won't see this any time soon is there simply aren't enough people able to pay with BTC to make the development effort (even if it's pretty modest) worth it.  Maybe in a couple years depending on how things go with adoption, but who knows.  It's one thing to simply add bitcoin as a payment option in your traditional business model, but it's another thing to build business models around bitcoin payments.  The latter needs a reasonably large bitcoin user base to be practical.  I imagine the pioneers in that area will be companies who's customer base is largely composed of bitcoin users.

That wasn't my point at all lol.  I actually do actively try to change people's minds, since I'd much rather do that since it can potentially avoid violent outcomes.  My point was that disparaging people often is counterproductive to helping them see your point of view, and if anything makes a violent outcome more likely since it increases animosity between the two sides, and hatred (or any strong emotion really) is the enemy of objective and rational thought.  I have no problem with defending myself by force if necessary, but I do try to avoid it when possible since there's no guarantee I'm going to win :)  I'm happy to try to win by diplomacy until it's no longer an option.

I never agreed that you should count fees twice for first purchase.  I was pointing out that's what *you* were doing (scenario A) and I tried to explain (it obviously didn't get through to you) why I don't think that's a fair analysis.  In the "first purchase" scenario, you're buying $20 worth of BTC to buy a $10 product.  In other words, you bought $10 worth of BTC to buy the product with, and another $10 worth... why exactly?  Because you want some BTC also?  *That's independent of the product purchase and you should apply the fees separately*.  That was my point from the beginning.  This really isn't that hard.
If you just want to buy a $10 product, you only need to buy $10 worth of BTC, not $20.  If you want to buy and save another $10 worth of BTC on top of that, go ahead, but it makes no sense to apply the fee for that to the product purchase.  It's entirely unnecessary to that transaction.

If misguided ideas from random people on reddit brings bitcoin down, then it deserves to die.  I'm not at all worried that would actually happen; I have a bit more faith in the robustness of bitcoin than that.
I'm not really disagreeing with anything else you said, although I would point out that bitcoin would enforce certain disciplines on the entire system in such a way that it might look quite a bit different than it does today (you can't guarantee against a run on a fractional reserve system, for example - on demand withdrawals from a fractional reserve system would always be a ticking time bomb).  Our current system is a gigantic recipe for moral hazzard - no one cares how responsibly their bank lends because it's all insured under one centralized scheme (FDIC), and if shit ever really hit the fan the system would be bailed out anyway.  It's a system that overweighs returns and underweighs risk.  The improvement with bitcoin imo is that it enforces the consequences of bad decisions on those involved with the schema surrounding those decisions, rather than providing an outlet valve to socialize losses across the entire monetary system.  A bitcoin monetary system would make clearer the differences between saving and investing.  In our current system, the line is blurred.

Because by your definition, no one in the history of finance thinks they're making a risky bet, because they wouldn't be making it if they thought the odds are against them.  The way "risk" is used in finance is such that it's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just a factor to be accounted for (it's just a term used for variance, really).
I'm long bitcoin because I think the odds are in my favor, but I also consider that position to be high risk due to high variance.  That's the spirit in which the term is generally used in finance.

The thing is, Bitcoin the payment processing network doesn't have to compete favorably with all forms of payment processing in order for bitcoin the currency to compete favorably vs fiat currencies.  Just like Mastercard and Visa are not currencies themselves, it's important to distinguish between the currency aspects of bitcoin and the payment processing capabilities of the blockchain.  The strengths of the latter are p2p transactions that are difficult if not impossible to reverse/censor, but efficiency is not necessarily one of its strengths - the only benefits to efficiency are if you are able to circumvent overly cumbersome regulations or if you lack a trustworthy central processor to otherwise utilize.  That's ok imo, but of course the more we can improve scalability, the better.  The strengths of bitcoin the unit of account (depending on your views on macroeconomics) are the limited supply enforced through decentralized consensus.  There is some overlap in that another strength of the currency is its ability to be sent electronically peer to peer, but the point is it doesn't have to necessarily compete with centralized payment processors in order for the currency to succeed, just like the Dollar and Euro don't compete with Visa and Paypal; they in fact work together.

You won't be *directly* affecting an order book, but in the grand scheme of things you're still affecting buy/sell pressure in the overall market and all those effects in aggregate do affect the prices on exchanges, albeit in a less direct way.

What you're saying is true as far as "real" resources are concerned.  Physical, consumable commodities with industrial uses, land, labor, industrial capital, things like that.
But that's exactly why a monetary system that's composed of nothing more than numbers on a ledger is *ideal*.  You aren't withholding any real resources from the economy by saving a number on a ledger.  The common fallacy regarding this point is to think that savings not being spent is in effect "withholding resources" since money is sometimes viewed as a "resource", but this is an error resulting from taking a micro viewpoint on a macro topic.  The only purpose of money is to facilitate the exchange of *real goods and services*, and the nominal quantity of money is irrelevant to that purpose - the only thing that matters is the movement of relative quantities.  To demonstrate why it's not a "real" resource, think of it this way - if every single bitcoin address lost 90% of its balance overnight... is anything lost?  Aside from some temporary chaos as a new price equilibrium would need to be found, the answer is *no*.  The remaining 10% can do the exact same job as the original 100%, and it does it just as well  - it's a nominal disruption with very little real affect.  It'd be in effect the same thing as just moving a decimal point in the protocol.  The only real effect would be due to friction from human tendencies to think nominally, and there would be inefficiencies while the nominal adjustment took place (If you change 90% to 1%, you can probably ignore those effects for the most part).  But no real resource was actually lost.  You can see how this isn't true for a store of value like gold, since like you explained, gold is a real resource with some industrial/cultural uses.  
How this relates to savers is that savers aren't withholding any real resources from the economy - they're actually temporarily helping everyone else (the spenders) acquire their desired resources by reducing competition for them.  You're basically temporarily removing a certain amount of money from circulation, which increases the purchasing power of the remaining money in circulation (in reality these effects tend to be so small as to be effectively imperceptible on an individual basis, but in aggregate the effects are very real, hence why the micro vs macro viewpoint matters).  It's all an expression of savings vs spending preferences, and it helps properly allocate *real* resources in the economy if the people who don't see the need to acquire them right now (savers) don't compete  with the people who actually do (spenders).  And that's what you want - contrary to popular opinion, you don't want people to spend *just because*, since that crowds (and increases the prices in) the real resource marketplace for those who actually have uses for them other than simply looking for a place to best park their wealth.  That's not how you most efficiently allocate real resources.
That's actually one of the relative benefits of gold as money, historically speaking.  Especially before the electronics age (which still only accounts for a tiny portion of the overall gold market, since gold plating is usually sufficient for most electronics uses and can be made incredibly thin), there wasn't really any essential industrial uses for gold - it had the nice property that it didn't corrode, but other than that it's a fantastically terrible structural metal (extremely heavy with low structural integrity, generally the opposite of what's usually desired for a structural metal).  The anti-corrosive properties are fantastic as a store of value, however - you can pass it down from generation to generation or leave it buried in a vault with little to no loss in quality, which is a much rarer quality than you might initially assume.  That's why it was mostly only used for coins, jewelry, and other decorative uses - a sign (and store) of wealth.  Of course, it's not as good in that respect as abstract units of account (fiat/bitcoin), which have no other uses outside of their accounting function, but again historically speaking the problem with fiat has always been trusting the issuer with responsible management of the supply, something gold manages through physical scarcity.  Bitcoin may give us the best of both worlds in that respect, which is why it's such a potentially revolutionary technology in monetary history (censorship resistant digital payments are another part of that as well).

So Circle uses "cash advances" with credit card transactions, correct?  I'm assuming that's the case since it warns you about the possible fee at the purchase page.  If that's the case, I found [this thread at bitcointalk]( talking about the reversibility of cc cash advances and it sounds like it's a far more difficult process than your average chargeback:


And it's a much longer process than some scumbag frat boy lying to PayPal and clicking a few buttons.

My point is that only a coin that can remain profitable relative to bitcoin *while having comparable hashpower* is a serious threat.  Otherwise miners jumping over en masse would jackup the difficulty and drive the altcoin into the realm of the horridly unprofitable.  A coin becoming more profitable at 1/1000 the hashpower means nothing, it's just the market making a minor equilibrium adjustment at the margins.  Wake me up when a coin remains more profitable than bitcoin while also approaching it in hashpower.
Presently, there is no serious competitor to bitcoin.  That could change in the future, sure, but right now nothing comes particularly close.  The closest in terms of size is litecoin, but that's not an option for bitcoin miners to transition to, at least not without buying completely new hardware - I don't think they're itching to render their current hardware investment obsolete.

The reason why it's likely to go below market is because the inflexible party here is the seller.  A fuckton of bitcoin are being sold no matter what, so offer a price.
If it was the other way around and an inflexible party was demanding to buy a fuckton of bitcoins on a specific date and accepting bids for sales, then you'd likely see the opposite.

People just see decentralization differently, that's all.  It's a fuzzy concept, so there should be no surprise if others view it differently than yourself.  If someone appears to have trouble understanding how differing opinions could exist for sincere reasons, that leads me to believe they don't understand or fully appreciate the subtleties of the topic.

It depends, but an obvious example where it wouldn't would be if the address was otherwise empty.  If you follow the privacy best practice of not reusing addresses, it's normal to have old empty addresses that you are no longer using, but someone can spam them and if you're not paying attention yoru wallet might merge some or all of them into a new transaction.
If the address isn't empty it's a bit more complicated, it depends on the wallets input selection and the specific amounts in question.  Generally speaking though the empty addresses are the main vulnerability.

Because the reason why businesses have no liabilities denominated in bitcoin is because bitcoin is today very unstable and very few people accept it.  If bitcoin stabilizes, there's no reason why you can't denominate liabilities in bitcoin.  You can theoretically pay anything but government taxes in bitcoin, it's just a matter of whether or not people accept it (hey, maybe one day the government will take bitcoin for taxes as well, who knows), and whether or not it's denominated in bitcoin will depend on bitcoin becoming stable enough to make it a practical unit of account.  It is obviously no where near that today, but there's no fundamental reason why it can't become a decent unit of account with widespread usage.
The reasons you're giving for bitcoin not becoming stable are a consequence of bitcoin not being stable.  That is circular.  I realize it's circular in the other direction as well, which is why this is a bit of a chicken or egg situation.  That just means don't expect it to happen overnight, but the system could evolve in that direction, or not.  But the answer is neither the chicken or the egg.

The users, merchants, exchanges, wallets, etc. decide which miners (algorithm) they accept as proof-of-work.  If one group doesn't want to cooperate, the next largest (scrypt in the present) will be more than happy to since it'd be a dramatic spike in revenue for them.  If *all* the established mining groups collude, then you start from scratch with a new algorithm that doesn't have an established asic industry, and it's back to the mining wild west of processors and graphics cards until a more specialized industry is rebuilt.  I don't think it would ever come to that, but even if it does it's still not an insurmountable problem by any means.
SHA-256 miners can only control SHA-256 proof of work.  There's nothing saying the existing participants in the bitcoin network have to stick with SHA-256.  Any proof of work will do; they are interchangeable.  The economic majority gets to decide which algorithm to use, and that's what gives them the ability to fire/hire any group of miners they wish.

The main difference is simply whether or not you have a central bank with a lot of control over interest rates.

I have a lot of "liberal" values (my friends tend to be mostly liberal), but when it comes to our current governmental structures, I tend to lean libertarian, for what can more or less be narrowed down to one single idea - consent of the governed.  In our current system, simply existing within the borders of a country (which covers basically the entire land mass of the world) is treated as "consenting" to *all* the rules and regulations of the government in control of those borders.  I think this power structure is backwards.  Outside of violent crime (since I believe violence is justified to defend yourself from violence), I believe consent of the governed should be engineered from the bottom up rather than enforced from the top down.  If it's not something I'd personally feel justified inflicting violence over, I don't believe in enforcing it through law.

In 50 years, potentially ~$20,000,000 2014 Dollars per BTC.  Number arrived at by summing estimates of global currency totals + US bond market + gold market and dividing by total BTC circulation.  As far as *upper bounds* go, I actually consider that a conservative upper bound estimation.  For one, the economy in 50 years will probably be significantly larger than it is now (barring some apocalyptical resource shocks or us nuking ourselves into oblivion).  I also only included the US bond market, when I really should be including all zero-nominal risk bond markets, which basically includes all sovereign bonds denominated in the currency issued by the given sovereign.
I think BTC will derive most of its value as a perfectly deflationary store of value (or at least trending towards one in a predictable manner).  We've never had that before in the history of the world - even gold generally has an average rate of supply inflation of ~1-2% per year.  That 1-2% is what opens the door for something like US bonds to compete with it.  In 20 years, bitcoin's rate of monetary inflation will be down to around ~.1% per year, and it will continue to trend to zero.
I'm sure this sounds like lunacy to a lot of people, but I'm operating on the possibility that our current sovereign debt based monetary system is not the final evolution of money, and that crypto-currency could be the next step.  The real consequence of a perfectly deflationary store of value is this - the market has complete control over interest rates.  Personally I suspect that may be, if not a perfect solution, the "least bad" solution.  
When people complain about deflation and how "people won't spend", the "proper" economic argument behind that is that interest rates will be higher.  And they will be.  The consequences of the financial crisis we're living through right now may be what finally convinces the masses that higher interest rates, lower consumption, and higher savings rates are not necessarily bad things.  There's a proper balance for these things, and the real question is whether we ask the market to search for the proper balance, or a centralized entity like the federal reserve.
Of course, the crypto experiment could be a huge failure and bitcoin will eventually be worth nothing.  So, my prediction is somewhere between (or equal to) those two extremes :)

You say they're "stuck" running deficits, but isn't the *ability* to run deficits a boon for a government, at least in the present?  It means they can spend more and tax less, both of which is highly favorable for the present government, both in terms of real economic and geopolitical influence (hence the military spending) and politics (lower taxes).  Governments love to run deficits, they're generally only reigned in by their credit-worthiness.  I'm not saying that's good or bad, but that's my best understanding of how it simply is.


True, but I'd argue the main beneficiary of that arrangement is whoever can produce the fiat for free.  I don't think I'm able to do that.  It may be a boon for our banking industry in addition to the government, but it's not a good deal for a manufacturing worker in the US, or anyone trying to make a living by producing those goods that we're now importing for "free".  I'd describe it as creating a distortion in the US economy that favors those close to the money creation process and hurts those far from it.
The only way you could consider it a bad deal for the government is if you take into account the growing debt, but that's the future government's problem (but of course it will slowly but surely become a problem in the present).

"Only"?  The only way to measure value is relative to other things, so saying it's going up in terms of other currencies is the exact same thing as saying it's going up in value (assuming those other currencies remain stable in value).  That doesn't mean it's not a currency, it just means it's a deflationary one.  If I decide to realize those gains by trading BTC for real goods and services, then it's a currency.  Whether or not it's inflationary or deflationary is irrelevant to that.


In may reduce it some, but not to zero - consumption merely balances around a different equilibrium.  Like I said, people don't hold off purchases forever until they die, since the whole point of making money (at least for the vast majority of people) is so that you can spend it.  Never spending it does nothing for you.  
Note that if the reduced consumption causes the economy to contract, that would actually cause the currency to face inflationary pressures (fixed supply + shrinking economy = inflationary pressure), which would incentivize spending.  It's the natural feedback loop by which markets set and respond to interest rates (real, not nominal).  
Consumption is not some sort of holy grail that we should maximize at all costs - there's the goldylocksian "just right" amount of consumption for efficient growth of the economy.  You can't simplify economic arguments down to "less consumption = bad".  If anything, it's pretty easy to form the argument that we're already over-consuming past a sustainable level, and keeping it up is just mortgaging the future.  It's the kind of consequence you might expect from operating on the idea that the best way to grow the economy is to maximize consumption.

It's safe to say anything that is expected to go up in value will be treated as an investment, since it serves the purposes of one.  Even if the current community doesn't treat it as one, if the value continues to rise then it's going to attract speculators who will.  That's to be expected.

High volatility = high risk.  Bitcoin is pretty volatile.  
It's not a bad thing; that much I agree with.  But I don't see much point in trying to argue that it's not highly volatile, and thus high risk.  High risk generally means potential for high reward as well, and overall risk to your portfolio is easily mitigated by taking a smaller position (hence the whole "don't invest more than you can afford to lose" thing).

You can avoid things like this if you're staying purely in the bitcoin space - independent wallet to wallet transactions purely in BTC, for example.  Coinbase/Circle however are interfaces with fiat.  They aren't pure bitcoin services, and they have to deal with the same laws, regulations, and fraud risks as the traditional fiat monetary system.  The fact that *one* side of the trade is bitcoin doesn't change that - in fact, it makes the fraud concerns even more pressing.
Circle cancels transactions for fraud concerns as well - you have to be extra vigilant in this area when trading irreversible assets (bitcoin) for reversible ones (ACH/credit cards/etc.).  One or the other service may work better for certain users based on the intricacies of their fraud detection, but neither are immune from dealing with laws, regulations, and fraud, because as I mentioned earlier, they are fiat interfaces.

That will realistically happen on a wider scale when companies can pay some of their expenses with bitcoin, and even then there will be some frictions in doing so due to the current tax law (if they hold bitcoins, they'll have additional tax obligations to account for based on any gains/losses, which add to the overhead of doing so).  Also, most large companies have little room in their cash flow to take on exchange rate risks, so they may need adequate hedging instruments to do so, but that again is additional overhead.
It'll take time, in other words.  And that's fine.  Organic growth is what's necessary here.

If you want to call it an altcoin go ahead, all I'm saying is the value will follow wherever the economic majority goes, and the value is what matters.  I don't really care what you call it, so long as it functions the same as bitcoin (aside from the proof of work algorithm which doesn't affect anyone other than miners) and all the same services and balances transfer over without a hitch (they can and will, assuming they want to).  
If it's not "bitcoin" anymore, no one will notice and it doesn't really matter.  In all practical manners, it is bitcoin.  You won't notice any difference throughout the transition.
In other words, like I said earlier, value is what matters, and imo whatever network carries the value of bitcoin over is "bitcoin", but if you don't want to call it that that's fine.  It might be confusing to people to call it something else however.
This is the point I think some people are missing - you can make this transition the exact same way you would make an ordinary hard fork - just update the necessary software/nodes.  It makes no difference to the rest of the network whether the hashing algorithm we all agree upon is SHA-256 or scrypt or whatever.  Your balance, your wallets, your exchanges will all function just as they would through a normal hard fork, and SHA-256 miners would have zero say in what happens on this new fork.  Scrypt miners could still decide to cause problems (assuming we switched to scrypt, which we wouldn't *have* to of course), but I can't imagine why they would do so when we're offering to drop a 10x or more revenue increase in their lap.  That should be more than enough reason to be cooperative.


Yes, but again, *we get to choose which group of miners we hire*.  Just because I hire someone to cut my lawn, doesn't mean I have no control over how my lawn is cut.  You find someone who's willing to do what you ask.  If someone knows they can be fired, that's usually a pretty good incentive for them to do what you ask.  If they don't do it, you find someone who will.

Exactly!  You don't use it if you don't have BTC savings that you want to maintain.  That's my point.  You're grouping up the decision to save $10 worth of BTC with the decision to purchase something for $10 worth of BTC.  You don't have to do both, and those are two independent transactions.  Purchasing BTC to save has a fee.  Purchasing BTC to spend has a fee.  You don't need to save if you just want to spend.  You would use buyback if you already have $10 worth and want to maintain that.  Understand now?  You're applying the fee for an extra $10 worth of saving to the $10 product purchase.  I think that's bogus accounting.  You should account the fees to what they actually buy you.


I urge you to heed your own advice!  I'm sure you feel the same, but from my perspective you're failing miserably in basic logic.  Funny how that works.

Basically, the only way it wouldn't be is if the economic majority of the network agreed to fork to a version that was no longer hard capped.  This decision however can't be made unilaterally.  Even miners can't decide it for us since it's a symbiotic system - miners only have a value-creating job if they're mining for a network with participants who economically value that network, otherwise what they mine is worthless.  They could fork to a version of bitcoin with infinite rewards, but if the actual users of the network don't follow them then their new network is just a bunch of miners and thus useless/worthless.  They can mine all these new "bitcoins" they want, but if the wallets/exchanges/merchants don't move to the updated protocol that recognizes them then they won't be able to actually do anything with them.
It may have been a bit unclear from the way I worded it, but I didn't mean to say it is certain to be finite; what I was trying to say is that the promise of a completely fixed supply is not dependent on a central authority (who is always tempted by seigniorage) to keep that promise.  It's rather dependent on us all (the economic majority, to be more precise) to continue to choose that framework.  This is a new monetary dynamic historically speaking, so how it plays out still remains to be seen, but the potential is there, and it represents something we've never really had before.

There is one fundamental part of bitcoin that is inherently "libertarian" in nature, at least from the perspective of limiting government power - the fact that the money supply is not controllable by a central bank.  If bitcoin were to widely circulate as money, that would take away most of the government's ability to control interest rates, which would instead be left up almost entirely to the market.

The wildcard in the blocksize debate is what kind of network topology would be required to resist serious censorship/banning attempts by major world governments (I still think that's a legitimate concern, particularly if bitcoin gets to the point where it starts affecting the functionality of major fiat currencies), and how block size (and in turn node resource requirements) affects that topology.  Bitcoin so far has been relatively left alone in that department (some exceptions of course), but I definitely don't think it's wise to take it for granted that it will always be that way.
Anyone who thinks they *know* the answer to that question is probably drawing confidence from ignorance, not intelligence.  IMO the existence of a wide variety of viewpoints on this debate makes perfect sense, and if you can't understand why people might have legitimate disagreements (and not just small ones), then you probably don't appreciate the subtleties at play.

If you hang around a while, you'll probably end up like that too.
I'm not particularly worried because for as bad as the China news is, the situation in the US is looking pretty damn good.  If I could ask for one change, it'd be that the recently announced tax status include an exception for BTC transactions under a certain amount (or under a certain limit per year), but I don't think anyone in their right mind ever expected the IRS to not want to collect capital gains on an asset that appreciates by thousands of % in a frickin year.
There are a lot of legitimate companies and big investors getting involved with bitcoin in the US (did you check out the recent Coin Summit?), and at least so far many of the regulators don't seem to be out to kill it.  This is honestly better than I ever expected; when I first learned about bitcoin a few years ago I thought there was a very good chance it would be straight up banned, *especially* in the US.

If you look at the past, there have been bitcoin bubbles of all sizes.  In this case, the bubble popped because of the China news.  Unless you knew about that beforehand, you didn't know when it was going to stop.  I think this idea that the size of the bubble and where and when the rough top and bottom will be is somehow easily predictable is retarded.

Bitcoin usually makes the mainstream headlines when the price is doing something wacky (either way up or down).  When the price action isn't that volatile, as has been the case for the past few months (at least by bitcoin standards), headlines tend to die down with it.
Bitcoin's price history has been a story of alternating periods of volatile bubbly behavior and times of relative stability.  Behind all that, the actual infrastructure growth has been chugging along pretty steadily.  I'd say things are moving along quite nicely, we're just in a relatively quiet period as far as price activity is concerned and thus not too many headlines in the media.

Of course it doesn't.  No one is claiming it did, it just automates the process a bit. 
The point of dispute here is whether or not you should be counting the 1% + $0.15 fee *twice*.  I'm not arguing with anything else in your posts, just this one point.


Here's what happens if I currently use this feature.
1. I send $10 worth of BTC to a merchant.  No fee here, Coinbase covers fees for BTC transactions.
2. I buy back $10 worth of BTC to replenish my account to its original standing.  1% + $0.15 fee applies here.
That's it.  Where I'm disagreeing with you is when you're trying to count the fee I paid for the original BTC as part of "this transaction".  I think it's wrong to do that for the reasons I've already stated earlier.
Yes, this transaction still carries fees.   I agree with you there, just not about the part where you counted it twice.  I hope that's clear.  Counting the original purchase is misleading since at the end of this process you would be up $10 in BTC as well as the purchase, i.e. you bought a $10 product and also an additional $10 in BTC beyond what was required to pay for the product.  You don't need to buy $20 worth of BTC in order to pay for a $10 product obviously.

It will if demand goes to zero.  Supply is known, the ? mark is demand.  
The reason why I'm betting on demand not going to zero is *because* of the fact that its supply properties give it the potential to be a fantastic store of value, and as the first of its kind, network effect gives it a significant edge over all followers.  That process can feed on itself, and yes, it's the same behavior you see during the buildup of a bubble, but money is the bubble that potentially doesn't have to pop if it meets its promise on the supply end.  Money needs to be a "bubble" to be useful, after all.  It needs value that it doesn't have "intrinsically".  If the supply is responsibly managed, then it won't necessarily ever pop.  That's why I agree with calling gold "a 6000 year old bubble".  I just don't necessarily see it as a bad thing - it's doing its job.  It's lasted so long because there's no central authority to abuse the supply.  You can only mine it so fast, and thus the bubble endures.

Hard forks can be tricky, sure, and must be attempted with great caution.  But that goes for hard forks in general, and switching algos isn't actually a very significant change in how bitcoin operates.  It only affects one very specific part of its function, and we know scrypt hashing works fine already.  It doesn't really change how consensus works, for example.  
Like I said, I'd consider this "the nuclear option" and I doubt it'd ever even get to that point, but my point is the option is there.  I stand by my statement that miners don't have all the power because they don't bring most of the value to the bitcoin network, and value is what ultimately matters.  Miners are infinitely more replaceable than the rest of the bitcoin ecosystem, since choice of proof-of-work is pretty much arbitrary.

Didn't mean to imply they were doing us a favor if that's what it sounded like.  I'm just explaining why they *can* do it, and it's because they can sit on USD in the form of Treasuries.  Although I do think it's an advantage for the *US Government* (not the US economy as a whole) to be able to export inflation and run deficits for cheap.  It might have a little something to do with why we can afford to outspend the rest of the world combined on military expenditures.  For your average US worker though, it can be a bit of a raw deal.


China may be accumulating USDs to keep their currency low, but the reason why they're doing that *with US Dollars rather than anything else* is because it offers the best and safest rate of return (or at least it has in the past, I think that era is in the process of coming to an end).  If you're going to hoard something, you pick whatever the best thing is to hoard.  And this goes back to my original point - the USD has been the reserve currency for all of recent history precisely because it's been the most hoardable.  It's an important quality of money, and completely flies in the face of the argument often thrown around that modern money needs to be inflationary in order to encourage people to spend because that's what makes good money.  The USD is actually a counter-example for that.  Inflation isn't to discourage hoarding; it's to give the central bank more control over interest rates.

He actually admits to making comments along those lines as well, what he's claiming is that what he was implying by "that" was misunderstood.
He never directly admitted to it, this is even acknowledged in the original story, which wrote that he "tacitly" admitted to it.  Tacitly - as in not stating directly, but being implied.  Verifying that he said "I'm not longer involved with that" does nothing to clarify what he meant by "that".

You can't bail it out when it fails.  One experience with that and people might be a lot more hesitant to put their money into a fractional reserve system.  Without confidence, fractional reserve systems fail.
With bitcoin, that confidence has to be truly earned.  You can't just buy confidence by printing up money for a bailout.  It's also much easier to force transparency with fractional reserve systems with cryptographic tools such as proof of reserves.

Like I said, the payment benefits for consumers are less obvious.  It sounds like you agree with me there, great.
The benefits for merchants are however quite clear.  Which is why this thread exists - it's highlighting a merchant not being aware that it's a pretty good deal for a merchant.  Also, some of these benefits can and will (already have in some cases) feed back to the consumer in the form of discounts for paying with bitcoin.  As someone who pretty much only deals with companies with a good reputation, I'm quite fine not having chargebacks as in the little over a decade of my adult life, I've never actually asked for one.  I know that doesn't apply to everyone; just speaking for myself here.  I'd be more than satisfied if escrow features were optional ones that I could use only in cases where I'm worried about the integrity of a merchant.  This properly allocates the cost of those services to transactions where trust is lacking, rather than blanketing them across the entire economy regardless of the reputability of the merchant.
A discount, by the way, does speak to everyone.
I think part of what will make bitcoin appeal to the masses is the fact that it's deflationary.  I know a lot of economists think that's a bad thing, but after spending a few years researching the topic for myself (including reading all of the pro-inflation arguments), I disagree.  Sure, if you think monetary policy is desirable, then so is inflation, but if you don't want monetary policy then inflation is entirely unnecessary.  And if someone argues "but people won't spend it because it's deflationary", I think that's nonsense as well, since it's effectively saying that people won't realize gains.  The point of making gains in the first place is to realize them, unless your goal is to amass as much unspent wealth as possible and die before you gain any benefit from it.  Realizing them by directly spending bitcoin is more efficient than first converting, then spending, assuming you can spend them directly on what you'd like, and since it's a good deal for merchants, why won't they accept them?  If you want escrow services, those can be built on top of bitcoin payments.  If people demand them, someone will provide them.  Those are services that exist independently of the underlying currency.

Except people have been saying that a syndicate was a sign of a low bid from the start.  The good news here is that they got outbid, but no one was expecting a syndicate composed of smaller buyers to bid high in the first place, since smaller buyers don't need to worry about moving the market with their purchases.  The minimum for the syndicate was $25k, and like mr. boomstick said, you can buy that trivially on any exchange with pretty much no effect on exchange rate (or coinbase with literally zero effect since they offer up to 50k/day at the current price), so the only reason to bid really would be in the hopes of getting a better deal.
It's still good news that they got outbid, but it's also rational to expect them to be one of the lower bidders.

A money that's only useful for one or the other is not very useful money.  The Dollar may be inflationary, but it's backed by US debt which historically pays a real and positive rate of interest on the order of ~2-3 percent per year.  US debt in turn is backed by the growth of the US economy, and to an extent the global economy as well (due to the Dollar's reserve status).  When Dollars are held in reserves, no one actually holds Dollar bills, they hold US debt.
If you sub out the Dollar for a "deflationary" currency like bitcoin, the situation outlined above actually barely changes at all.  The real rate of return you would earn by holding bitcoin would be tied to the growth of the economy - it would on average be a similar ~2-3% real rate of return.  The only real difference is that you wouldn't have to park your reserves with the central bank to earn the risk-free interest rate - you could just hold onto your coins yourself.  This means however that the central bank can no longer manipulate interest rates.  That, by the way, is the actual reason we have an inflationary currency.  It's so we can have a central bank with the ability to manipulate interest rates/money supply (two sides of the same coin).  It's simply a way to empower monetary policy.
The idea that a currency needs to be inflationary in order to incentivize people to spend it is a complete myth.  They need to be inflationary if you want central management of interest rates and money supply.

The reversibility they have to worry about is you reversing the ACH payment.  They can't "instantly debit my checking account" (that's why normal purchases take 3-5 days, to help decrease the fraud risk of you reversing payment).  Of course, they also allow instant purchases up to a lower limit if they vet you through various verifications in order to minimize their risk, so what you're suggesting is definitely possible up to their instant limits with no significant change to their risk profile.  They already have a "buyback" feature that immediately initiates a purchase for the amount of BTC you spend from their wallet, and if that amount is within your instant limits you'll get it instantly.  It'd be rather trivial for them to reverse the order of that (buy BTC instantly and spend them, up to the instant limits of course) but then it'd be limited to instant limits, and a lot of Coinbase users don't even have instant enabled.  They could definitely add that feature, but I'm not quite as sure as you are that it would have the impact you think it will.

That's assuming the cryptographic function itself holds up, which is my point.  Cryptographic functions maintaining their algorithmic security is an assumption, not a fact.  If that assumption holds up, then what you just wrote does as well.  
Cryptographic functions work not because we can prove they do, but rather because we haven't found a weakness yet, and if we go a long time without finding a weakness, we *assume* they'll probably remain secure.  Again, mathematically proving the existence of a cryptographic function with no undiscovered weaknesses would be to solve the P vs NP problem and would earn you a Nobel prize.
You can see this in action with RSA - we've been slowly chipping away at its security, finding more and more efficient ways to crack it.  No one can predict whether that will happen to the algorithms used in bitcoin, and no one can guarantee that there will be better algorithms to replace them.
Don't get me wrong, I'm certainly betting that bitcoin will remain cryptographically secure - I think the odds it doesn't are tiny.

I don't think we'll ever see any reversibility built into the bare protocol, but we'll certainly see services built *on top* of the protocol that offer escrow services and the like, and it'll be up to the market if and when they want to use those services, since these options will carry their own trade-offs and overhead (much like the fees charged by payment institutions today).  People often say "oh so it will be just like it is today", but I disagree here since, for one, you have the option to use electronic payments cash-style if you want (that doesn't really exist today), and secondly it opens up the development of these services to be built by pretty much anyone, and so much of it can be done purely with software - hence why people refer to bitcoin as "programmable money".  I think these factors will certainly contribute to superior innovation and lower costs.  
There's also [solutions being developed]( to the "accidentally sent money to the wrong person" problem since it's pretty obvious that bitcoin addresses are not the most intuitive thing for interfacing with humans.  It'll be up to users and the market what the best preferred solutions end up being, but there will be no shortage of options imo - the way it should be.
I'm confident about one thing - the bitcoin of 5 years from now will bear little resemblance (at least to the average end user) to the bitcoin of today, even though the raw data in the blockchain may not change significantly.

Part 2:
If we don't see a significant change in interest rates in this alternate deflationary world, the next obvious difference to focus on is the one I mentioned earlier - the difference between stuffing BTC into cold storage vs. lending your Dollars to the currency issuer.
At first glance, lending Dollars to the government seems to offer the "benefit" of keeping the currency in circulation - but that's an illusory benefit, and let me explain why.  To demonstrate this, you need to consider what the affects are of actually removing the currency from circulation (cold storage, stuffing under a mattress, whatever), even if only temporarily.  When you remove some sum of currency from circulation, that puts deflationary pressure on the remaining currency in circulation, as you have less money circulating to represent the output of the economy (that's why you'll see some in the BTC community rather pleased when coins are lost rather than stolen - less in circulation means the ones that are still in circulation are worth more).  In other words, money left in circulation experiences a corresponding increase in purchasing power.  Of course, this is only until the saver decides to spend some of his savings, at which point the introduction of the currency into circulation has the opposite effect.  In reality, people around the world are hoarding/dishoarding continuously, and what I just described as a process of discrete events of inflationary and deflationary pressures melts away into the continuum known as economic activity, and the relative rates at which people are spending/saving form the process by which overall inflation/deflation and interest rates are determined.
If instead the money is loaned to the government at a guaranteed rate of interest, yes that money is kept in circulation for the duration of the loan, but when it's paid back the money just transfers back from government to saver, and that process as a whole negates *both* affects of the previously described hoarding/dishoarding events - the net effect is a wash.  You don't have the initial removal of currency from circulation, but you don't have the later reintroduction of it either.  Another way to think of this is that similarly to how the hoarding/dishoarding activity of individual savers melts into a continuum when you look at the economy as a whole, likewise you can think of the government receiving loans but also paying them out at the same time, which is how it works in practice.  As new treasuries are issued, matured ones are paid out - it's really a simple rollover with the only changes coming at the margins.  In aggregate, both these scenarios actually look nearly identical in function.
You might also think "loaning to the government" sounds more stable overall since money remains in circulation rather than hiding/reappearing, but in reality, like I mentioned earlier, hoarding and dishoarding is a continuous process happening throughout the economy, and thus the individual disruptions of a unique saver are completely negligible.  The only way the supply of circulating money substantially changes is if people en masse change their preferences towards saving or spending, but this process brings us to the next and final topic - the determination of interest rates!
When talking about interest rates based on economic growth earlier, I tried to be sure to emphasize that I was talking about "long term" interest rates, as in averages over a long period of time, because in the short term, market sentiment about future growth plays a major part in determining interest rates due to the large shifts in saving vs spending preferences that can result from that sentiment.  You can relate this dynamic to the well known saying regarding markets - in the short term, the markets are a voting machine (expectation of growth), and in the long term they are a weighing machine (actual growth).  Market interest rates are no different.  And this is where the real difference between inflationary and deflationary monetary systems presents itself - control over interest rates (I did say this was a story about interest rates, didn't I?).  The world with a limited deflationary currency like bitcoin would be largely at the mercy of market forces for determining interest rates - the government could still have some influence due to the fact that it's a large market player, but it wouldn't have the added tool of having monopolistic control over the money supply - an invaluable tool when it comes to determining interest rates.  An inflationary monetary system is necessary to give that tool adequate power - you've probably heard of the "zero-lower bound" after which monetary policy loses much of its power, and inflation allows for a bit of room to wield policy before that zero lower bound is reached.  You can't send nominal interest rates negative, since at that point people will just hold onto cash!  The higher your average rate of inflation is, the higher your nominal interest rates can be, and the more leeway you'll have before reaching the zero lower bound.
This is really what the inflation vs. deflation debate comes down to - who do you want to have control over interest rates?  The market, or a central institution like the fed?  Proponents of monetary policy will argue that it's been essential in preventing the frequent recessions we used to experience in the past.  Opponents might point out that the lack of market discipline has lead to the inflation of the [greatest credit bubble the world has ever seen]( and that we have yet to suffer the full consequences of it (sorry, couldn't quickly find a good chart for global debt vs gdp, but I'm pretty sure it looks similar, potentially worse).
I'm generally a pro market guy, so I tend to sympathize with the market interest rates camp.  If you're in that camp, a perfectly deflationary currency is the best monetary tool you could imagine.  And in this arena, bitcoin is a tremendously exciting development, since as far as perfectly deflationary commodity moneys go, we've *never actually had one*.  Even gold supply inflates at around 1-2% per year.  IMO, this is the aspect of bitcoin that truly forges new territory in the monetary realm.
There's really a lot more to go into about this topic, and this is just scratching the surface, but imo this is at least the proper *start* to the debate, and one that I rarely see being well understood when the argument does come up.  Instead you get points about how people won't spend or how people buy computers, which individually aren't necessarily wrong, but woefully inadequate assessments of the situation as a whole.
TL/DR - Inflationary money supply = fed control over interest rates.  Fixed money supply (otherwise associated with deflation) = market control over interest rates.
*edit* - just wanted to provide an answer to a question I posed early on - "Why exactly does a currency issuer need to borrow its own money?"  The answer is that they don't - they do so because **savers need to be able to save it**.  Otherwise it's not good money, and in order to save an inflationary currency, you need to earn interest.  Spending and saving are both essential functions of money.  That's what the Dollar crisis of the 70's/80's was ultimately about - after Nixon removed the gold backing of the Dollar, confidence in the Dollar as a store of value dropped (mainly by megaproducers like the oil giants who need a means to reliably save their excess production), and mass dishoarding leads to rapid inflation.  Volcker cranked up interest rates (nominal rates reached as high as 15%+, real rates up to 10%) as a way to regain confidence in the Dollar - to present it as just as good, if not an even better savings medium than gold.  He convinced the world that the Dollar was money that could be saved, and that's what saved it as a currency.

I don't think Andreas would disagree with you there.  His argument is mainly that there's no incentive for miners to try one, and even if they did the damage would be minimal.  People act like miners have all the power, but they don't.  Exchanges would temporarily freeze trading/withdrawals (exchanges are the only realistic target for a 51% attack) and in the meantime Gavin could switch the protocol over to scrypt or some new cpu-friendly algorithm and completely destroy the SHA-256 mining industry and there's nothing they could do about it.  All that money invested in mining hardware and infrastructure immediately down the drain.  There's nothing special about SHA-256 as a proof of work, we can replace it with pretty much any sufficient hashing function.  This is basically a worst case scenario where a majority of the mining network has fully gone rogue, which is highly unlikely in the first place assuming they value their livelihood.
In other words, we can collectively fire the miners at any moment if we want to.  I don't think people appreciate that fact, but I'd assume Gavin has communicated that to the big mining pools.  Don't bite the hand that feeds.

If you compare the volume numbers we've heard from the major bitcoin merchants who've shared that information to the types of trade volumes that actually move the market on the major exchanges, it looks pretty unlikely that a new merchant coming on board would have anything more than a miniscule affect on price in terms of sell pressure.  Even if Microsoft generated say ~$100,000 in sales that first week (I'm pretty sure that number is ridiculously optimistic, but that helps demonstrate my point), that's just a tiny blip in the week's trading activity for any major exchange.  It might move the price a buck or two (if that), but not multiple percentage points.
In other words, speculative trading still vastly overwhelms merchant volume by several orders of magnitude.

There have been plenty of debates over on over what "to the moon" means.  For many, it includes a big price rise.  Others claim it's adoption and stability.  Jackson has expressed his opinion and made it quite clear that his public message (I don't claim to know what he actually thinks) is that he does not wish for a big price rise, but rather that price stability with widespread adoption is his "moon".  He thinks that's what it takes to be a real currency.  That has been his consistent public message.  It is at odds with some of the communities wishes, hence why he takes some criticism from the community every time he says that in public.

I think the most important thing about bitcoin is that it's a voluntary agreement among its users to use a "commodity" money that limits to a fixed supply, as well as (at least theoretically, we'll see how it actually plays out) providing a decentralized means of enforcing that agreement.  It's that aspect of bitcoin that's truly unprecedented in monetary history.
It's those properties that will potentially allow bitcoin to be the first "money" ever to allow the markets to purely determine the time value of money (also known as the risk-free interest rate), including swings in short term interest rates around the long term growth rate.  If you believe (as many economists these days do) that monetary policy is necessary to correct for the "faults" of the market, you would think this is a bad thing, but I personally think market rates represent the "less bad" option between those two, and I expect global monetary events over the next decade or two to swing sentiment in favor of that view :)  In order for the market process to perform at its full potential, however, we need a properly fixed money supply, not something with mild supply inflation and supply shocks like gold, and history has made it pretty clear that a currency issuer can not be realistically expected to not expand the supply.  Bitcoin is the first implementation of money that attempts to not rely on trust in a central entity to maintain a strictly fixed supply.
People tend to make a big deal out of bitcoin the payment protocol, but I personally think that's actually the substantially less significant aspect of it compared to its decentrally agreed upon and enforced limited supply.

Miners want to maximize the utility of bitcoin as much as anyone else.  Their revenue is denominated in btc, after all, so I don't see why they'd want to prevent any change that's widely viewed as "good" for bitcoin.  They want the price to rise as well. 
And like BTCisGod said, it's at best only partially up to the miners.  If the rest of the nodes agree on a change, the only thing the miners could do is collude to 51% attack the network, which would be highly self-destructive to their livelyhood.  It's hard to think of a realistic scenario where they'd want to do that.  It certainly wouldn't be over raising the block size limit.  Don't forget that the rest of the network can always fire the SHA-256 miners and hire the existing scrypt miner network if we want to (I'm sure they'd be more than happy to cooperate considering the windfall it would be for them).  If miners want to make sure their vast investment in SHA-256 asics isn't rendered useless overnight, it'd be best to not cause much trouble.
People consistently overrate the influence miners have over the protocol.  The economic majority is what really matters, and that's mostly non-miners.

You could use the multi-sig vault if you want full control over the address.  Coinbase can't touch anything in those addresses barring malicious javascript attacks to steal the encryption password for the shared key, but that's the same case as blockchain.info and most people refer to that as controlling your own keys.

FinCEN decides that, not the IRS.  FinCEN has made clear that bitcoin exchanges (which includes ATMs) have to register as money transmitter services.  The ATMs *are* required to do the palm scan thing in order to comply with KYC and AML regulations.
Regular ATMs don't have to do a palm scan because your ID is already registered with your checking account.
There's no requirement for different government agencies to use consistent language between their decisions.  Not defending this, as I obviously think it's silly, but that's how it is.

My meaning is that his technical background does little imo to imply that he's Satoshi (none of the guys I worked with would I have imagined as being capable of making bitcoin), and his language skills make me absolutely certain he didn't write the things the original Satoshi did.  Engineers who speak like he does don't write like Satoshi did - it's not a matter of effort, but simply a lack of sufficient language skills to pull it off.
They can also be highly awkward in personal communication, which could very well explain the misunderstanding between him and Leah.  She seemed to be forming much of her conclusion based on "the way he reacted", and imo she's implying more than just the words he said but the body language/way he said it.  Watch some of the recent interviews with her about the situation - it definitely sounds like some of the "admission" was inference on her part.  Notice in the original story it even says he "tacitly" admits it - tacitly, as in "understood or implied without being stated".  I could easily see someone misinterpreting a personal interaction with the old asian quirky/reclusive engineer stereotype if they're not used to dealing with them.

The mining game is a tough sell right now if you're actually looking to make a profit.  The USB miner most definitely won't earn you more bitcoin than you could just purchase for the price of the miner.  If you're just looking to play around and learn it's fine, but most "casual" miners play around with altcoins since the bitcoin mining market is very competitive and thus saturated.  If you want to play around with mining, altcoins are probably the way to go.  You can always trade what you earn for BTC on cryptsy if you want.
If playing around with and learning about mining isn't really your thing, I'd recommend just buying a small amount  of BTC to play with, at least for starters.  Hang around the subreddit, learn more, then go from there.  If you find the tech interesting then there's plenty to keep you busy, but if not there's really not much to do other than mine or invest.  This is still very much an "early adopter" stage, so it tends to be most attractive to people who are either passionate about the tech or looking for a high risk/high reward investment.  
Anyways, welcome!

In terms of payments, a blockchain-based crypto coin offers two primary advantages over a centralized solution - resistance to censorship, and not needing to trust a central middle man with your payments.  Cost of transactions isn't actually a real advantage of the design.
Blockchains aren't a particularly efficient way of keeping a ledger, since inherent in the design is a crap ton of redundancy, and that's not even counting resources invested in mining.  For example, I could run a single node of a cryptocoin and run a centralized payments company with all the security of bitcoins cryptographic signatures, and people would just trust me to keep the ledger.  That setup would be far cheaper than a blockchain equivalent with thousands or millions of nodes and X amount of energy invested in mining.  If it's just a micropayments network, trust isn't that big a deal - it's not a huge risk to trust someone with your micropayments, because if they break that trust you don't lose much.  That's the kind of role a company with a decent reputation could easily fill, and they could offer ridiculously cheap microtransactions, since the overhead would basically just be running one node (or a few, realistically speaking) with no need for mining.
The only reason why a blockchain crypto might have cheaper transactions than a centralized alternative is if there are regulations in place that add a lot of friction to the centralized solution, but are difficult or impossible to enforce on the decentralized solution - in that case, costs could be lower by circumventing burdensome regulations.
Current bitcoin transactions appear cheap because they're being massively subsidized by monetary inflation (not to be confused with price inflation).  The supply of bitcoins is currently rising at a rate of 10% per year, and all of that is going to miners, which is basically the cost of transaction processing and record keeping.  The current transaction costs are actually very high, just we aren't paying for it through transaction fees.  Yet.

They could, but they earn a better and safer return on US Treasuries (at least up until very recently) so why would they?  I think you're missing my point.

It's not a big factor at all.  It's a self adjusting mechanism.  Miners are never going to "abandon" bitcoin en masse, it's all about incremental changes to find equilibriums, and how much hashpower the market can support is directly related to the value of the block rewards.  Since the price is down, some miners have probably turned off their machines due to unprofitably, but that's where difficulty adjustments come in to find a new equilibrium.  The only people who should care about this process are miners, it doesn't really affect the function of bitcoin in general.

Why do you think bitcoin will never be changed to implement any improvements if the markets make it clear they want them?  Sure bitcoin isn't perfect; no coin is, and I expect improvements to general cryptocurrency architecture to steadily come about for the foreseeable future.

100 years isn't a particularly long time as far as monetary systems go.  You wouldn't say a volcano is dead because it hasn't erupted in a few hundred years.  You look at underlying factors to try to judge the dangers of subsequent eruptions - saying "but it hasn't happened in xx years" isn't particularly useful when you're talking about inherently infrequent events.
That being said, the people who go on record saying hyperinflation is going to come within a few years are underestimating the complexity of the global monetary system.  No one can make that kind of prediction unless they're in a position to cause it (or know the intentions of someone who is).  But you can check underlying factors (like the monetary base), which I would liken to measuring pressure in a volcanic cavity.
@_date: 2014-12-17 07:58:51
It's mostly an indication that the price is down, but we know that already so I'd say it's neither good nor bad, it's just the system behaving the way it's supposed to.  Hashpower tends to follow the price with a substantial lag (to be technical it follows block reward values, which follow price aside from the halvenings every ~four years), and difficulty follows hashrate.

I think you're confusing a scam where the operator runs off with the money (this is otherwise known as theft) with a ponzi scheme, where the people buying in after you pay you out, but when the process runs out of steam someone's eventually left holding the bag.  If you hide the fact that a ponzi scheme operates as a ponzi scheme, then that's a form of fraud based on deceit, but if you advertise rules clearly showing it's a ponzi scheme, then it's just another way to gamble, and as long as the operator is taking a cut, the odds are against you, just like any casino.
If someone thinks it's a reliable way to make money, they're an idiot, just like someone who expects to get rich playing roulette.  
I don't want to speak for too many people here since I'm just going off what I've seen about this on reddit, but it sounds like people were initially upset that they were being stolen from, not that they were losing money to a ponzi scheme.  There is a difference.  It's the difference between losing all your money over a course of hours of gambling at a roulette table, and losing all your money because the dealer straight up ran off with your chips.  One is gambling, the other is theft.
If you think trusting an anonymous person online with control of your money is foolish, then I agree, but that's by no means limited to people running a ponzi gambling ring.

Again though, is it compulsory, as in does everyone pay the fee regardless of participation?  A toll is only charged to people who drive on the road/bridge.  
Whether or not it's paid to the state then redistributed to an agency or paid directly to the agency sounds like a mere technicality if the government passed a law saying "every household must pay this much to fund this project".  If that's the case, then not calling it a tax sounds misleading at best.

By all means, go ahead, just stop with the sensationalist "stolen" BS.  Like I said, if they're stealing your coins, then your daycare is stealing your children for the day.  It makes no sense to describe it like that.


It would depend on whether or not they did so transparently.  As long as they tell you that's what they're doing, it's up to you if you want to risk it.  It's not my place to force people to be responsible with their money.  If they claim to be full reserve but are not, that is fraud.  If the government decides to insure deposits like they do with banks, I will bitch and complain that this is a system designed for moral hazzard, just like I do now.  It becomes my business in that case since government insurance is taxpayer funded.

I don't use either for any significant amounts.  I'd rather not go into detail about what I use since it's an unnecessary security risk to disclose that, but suffice it to say that I'm pretty sure you'd approve.
I was just referring to how most people distinguish between online wallets that fully control your keys (Coinbase's normal wallet) and online wallets that facilitate your management of and access to your keys without actually controlling them, but are potentially vulnerable to malicious code being delivered for you to run client side (blockchain.info and Coinbase multi-sig vault).  I think the distinction is meaningful since I do think it gives the company enough leeway to tell the government "we don't control those funds thus we can't freeze/seize them", which was the question being asked (not that it's impossible, but I view it as pretty unlikely particularly for unremarkable cases).

It sounds like you're ignoring the fact that the value of the network primarily comes from the the users - the individuals, merchants, exchanges, wallets, and the payment processors.  Just to demonstrate the balance of power here - in the worst case scenario that some hostile entity takes over a majority of the SHA-256 hashrate and commits to a prolonged attack, the rest of the network could just fork the protocol to scrypt and have the litecoin (and other scrypt coin) miners take over the job of securing the network.  The old bitcoin miners could continue the old SHA-256 chain, but no one other than themselves would be using it, and they would have zero influence over the new fork.  Which network carries the value - the network with the same old users, merchants, exchanges, wallets, and payment processors but with a new set of miners, or the network with a shit ton of SHA-256 hashing power and basically nothing else?  They wouldn't even have an exchange to sell their block rewards on, since no entity would want to stay with the old compromised network.  They would have effectively destroyed their own business and rendered their hardware and infrastructure investments worthless, while the rest of the bitcoin network might be a bit shaken up by the event but would carry on being perfectly functional.  
Yes, the miners have a lot of power, but only because the rest of the network *gives* them that power by choosing to use their proof of work.  We can take that away if we had to, but I don't expect that to actually happen since by far the biggest loser in that scenario is the SHA-256 miners.

They may not have a way to directly interfere with blockchain activity, but they certainly have power over the potential users due to the power of law and the threat of fines/jail.
At the very least, they can prevent you from being publicly open about using bitcoin, and for something meant to serve as money, that can be a bit of a hindrance.  Not a death knell, mind you, just a hindrance, and potentially a significant one.

I think the improvements are already happening.  Gox is a bit of a special case since they've been carrying momentum from being the first real bitcoin exchange - an operation as horrendously mismanaged and incompetent as them would have no chance of succeeding from scratch in the current environment.  It still boggles my mind how they could possibly lose most of their coins from *cold storage*, but I suspect we haven't heard anything resembling the real story about that yet.  
Hardware wallets will be a big step in improving security for individuals.  As the regulatory environment clears, I expect well funded and professional exchanges to take over (with proper and professional security practices) and with time I also expect a BTC insurance industry to crop up that enforces and regulates their own security standards in exchange for qualifying for deposit insurance. 
These things all take time, but they are happening.  I don't think we need to resort to a validation type system - the industry just needs to learn how to adequately deal with security regarding BTC.  
If there's one last big potential major fuck-up in BTC land, it's btc-e though.

I'm just basing it off what I've heard from [robocoin reps]( combined with the fact that no business man in his right mind would require such obtrusive procedures unless they actually thought they were at least potentially legally required.  They want to make money too, and if they thought the law was ok with them not requiring it, I imagine there's no way in hell they would do it, since it's not good for business.  Note that the law is not specifically for palm scans, but they supposedly need a way to verify you are actually who you're saying you are and they chose palm scans since they can't be matched up with any other existing database (no widespread use of palm scans).
So it's either they came to that conclusion after studying the law and consulting with lawyers, or maybe they're undercover NSA agents.  The latter is possible, I just consider it less likely than the more obvious explanation.  Plenty of people have looked into building bitcoin ATMs, if someone thought they could put one in the US without all that BS, then they probably would.  The fact that it's disabled on the Vancouver machine further indicates that it's enabled to comply with US law.

I agree.
If what they're trying to do with coinvalidation is indeed possible, then someone (a government agency even) will probably eventually do it.  We need to explore the possibilities, and if the results are deemed suboptimal then we need to find a way to actually make it impossible from a technical perspective rather than just yelling at the people who try to do it.  The latter is only going to work if the people behind it give a damn about being yelled out, which is not a particularly robust long-term solution.  I'm all for exploring the possibilities even if they're in a direction I don't necessarily like, because it's something we're going to have to deal with sooner or later, and sooner is better imo.  If we succeed in stopping them by merely spewing a bunch of vitriol, that's in the long term a false sense of security, and that imo does more harm than good.
That being said, they shouldn't be surprised at the hostility either.  Doesn't take a genius to see that coming considering what they're working on.  I'm not saying it's rational, but rather expected.

For example, dogecoin just forked today to a modified mining structure with non-random block rewards and some protection against hash rate manipulation (something pretty much all coins other than bitcoin have to deal with).  
The process would be basically the same - agree on the changes (or at least agree enough to form a large enough majority to move on with the changes), target a future block where the change will take place, and get everyone who agrees to install an updated client based on those changes.

You're talking about currency conversion fees (like you'd pay when exchanging Dollars with the local currency while on vacation).  OP is talking about transaction fees for simply moving money around; no currency conversion involved.
Since the bitcoin economy is currently tiny and limited, currency conversion fees are significant to the ecosystem, but the fact that transaction fees are so low does mean that a potential bitcoin economy could have far lower fees than what we see with our current financial system today.  This is a representation of that potential.
I agree with you that so long as using bitcoin generally involves conversion from fiat and back, the savings aren't nearly as great as they could be (it can even be more expensive depending on the specific circumstances).  But that doesn't change the fact that transaction fees within bitcoin are indeed very low compared to any other currency's financial system (outside of cash dealings, but those obviously have other drawbacks besides fees, mainly being physical only), and the more the bitcoin economy grows (meaning you can stay in bitcoin more often), the greater the savings will be.  This demonstrates that.

If you're operating in an inflationary monetary system (as pretty much every major economy has to varying degrees for the past century or so), the only time you flirt with deflation is during severe recessions and the credit collapse that occurs alongside it.  Of course there's going to be a correlation between deflation and poor economic performance in such a system (this should be plainly obvious to anyone who understands how these systems work), but I would dispute the direction of causality.  Deflation is most definitely a symptom of economic contraction in an inflationary monetary system, but that doesn't mean having a deflationary monetary system causes economic contraction (the US economy in the late 1800's demonstrates this).

I dispute that the value would drop to anywhere near zero.  There's no reason for it to, as after a temporary hold of a day or two, the network would be just as useful as before for all users.

The alternate algo mining power is already out there, it won't take long to reconfigure pools to mine bitcoin since there will be a large financial reward for doing so.

Whatever you want to call it (investment or not), the linked paper even points out that gold has had an average annual real rate of return of 4.3% since Nixon closed the gold window (marking the end of the last remnants of the gold standard).  Unless you're paying more than that for storage (if you are, you're getting ripped off), you have a positive real return.  
Gold is actually a lot more like government bonds than you seem to think.  Both can offer positive real returns primarily because the productive capacity of the economy grows over time.  In both cases it's ultimately just the time value of money working for you.  If the economy started shrinking or stagnating over the long term, both gold and government bonds would struggle to maintain a positive real return, excluding some sort of rebalancing type event where the collapse of one leads to a flow of value into the other, at which point all bets are off.

For just a very rough estimate, 10 pages of the dogetipbots recent history takes you about 4 hours back, while 2 pages of changetip (ignoring bitcointip since it's been out of commission for a month now) also takes you 4 hours back, so based on this admittedly too small sample size, I get an estimate of 5:1 doge to btc tipping rate.  That gives a rough estimate of the total value tipped during that time span being a little over 2:1 in bitcoin's favor.
Take these numbers with a big grain of salt, because 4 hours is a tiny sample size, but it's at least a rough estimate of the number that I think more meaningfully represents "who tips more".

I know, but I'm saying if you don't want to accept legal tender, you can just "barter" for anything else, which seems to defeat the purpose of the law.
Again, the only difference between bartering and selling seems to be whether you're trading for legal tender or not.  If you can choose to do either, then you don't really have to accept legal tender.  You just change a word from "selling" to "bartering" and apparently you're in the clear.  Seems rather silly.

If you think this is a good idea and are committed to pushing forward with it, I'd just accept that it's going to have to be done amidst much community disdain.  Nothing wrong with that as long as you're ok being the target of hate from strangers :)
I'm reserving judgement, but my general take is that if it *can* be done, I'm not going to get mad at someone for exploring the possibilities.  If we don't like it, something needs to be changed so that it *can't* be done rather than just yelling at the people who do it.

So I can say I'm willing to barter for bitcoins only?
By calling it a barter instead of a sale, can't you specify exactly what payment you want to accept?  That seems like a loophole around legal tender laws.  Or maybe it depends on a "currency" classification?  In that case, bitcoins would need to be legally classified as a currency to prevent someone from opening a bitcoin-only barter shop.

From my viewpoint, it's none of my business whether or not he created bitcoin, but the more complicated matter is whether or not we should care who may or may not be in possession of 1 million+ bitcoin.  Money is power, and if bitcoin does take off then anyone in possession of that stash could potentially be the most powerful person on Earth.  That does affect us all.  For example, if I knew that the second coming of Hitler was in possession of those bitcoins, I'd be inclined to support another option, as I have no interest in contributing to the empowerment of that individual since it could be rather detrimental for what I would consider to be a healthy society.
The reason why I'm not overly concerned about it is that, at least from what we know about Satoshi, I don't feel that I need to worry about some evil overlord (NSA conspiracy theories aside).  It actually could be a good thing if the richest person in the world is someone who I think has good fundamental values, assuming of course that wealth doesn't corrupt them.  But I'm just trying to clarify that there's a difference between caring about who wrote the original code (I don't, since they have no special power it doesn't matter), and caring about who may be our future money'd overlord (this is a legitimate concern imo).

Honestly, if you want to protect against a full US legal apocalypse scenario, you really shouldn't be storing your coins with a company based in the US.  Even if they take precautions like the ones you listed above, it could still land them in legal hot water to try to skirt the law in that way (the US in particular can be rather aggressive with assets stashed abroad), and I don't think they're willing to put themselves on the line like that (and don't really blame them, honestly).
The best defense against legal threats imo is and always will be keeping your keys to yourself in as anonymous a way as possible.  Centralized services will always be the easiest targets for legal threats.

I think that's exactly what it means, "by same audience" she probably just means visitors are randomly directed to one or the other, but there's no separation by time interval or anything like that.  Statistically speaking, this is a decent approximation of "the same audience" so long as incoming visitors are actually divided randomly.


While there might be a little bit of the first (see: buttcoin), if I'm hypothesizing then I think a bigger factor could be people are just curious about bitcoin so they click the link even though they don't have any.  At that point, they've been sidetracked from the donation process, which can certainly lead to a fall in conversion - these are delicate processes and people are easily sidetracked like dogs by a squirrel.  They could easily investigate how much of a potential factor that is by seeing how many people actually click the bitcoin link without donating (for additional perspective you could then compare that to the loss rate of people who make it to the standard step 2), although that still wouldn't tell the whole story.  This all goes to say - visitor retention is a very delicate thing and they're right to be cautious about adding anything more than necessary to a donation landing page - particularly links that could derail someone from the process.
Also, it's worth pointing out that they aren't proposing any hypothesis as to why this is, although a lot of people here seem to be assuming it's "oh they're implying that people don't like bitcoin" and getting defensive.  They don't say that anywhere in the post, and hypothesizing the cause of the resulting statistics is probably useful feedback so I'd recommend posting it on the blog thread (they have the tools to investigate most of this, however time is another matter).
Slightly off topic - I don't really like the push some people in this community make to get companies to prominently display that they accept btc - imo just accepting it (and having a reasonably easy way to get there) is plenty good enough.  It just comes across like you're pressuring for advertising when you do that (and honestly, they're generally thinly veiled attempts to do just that).  I wouldn't be surprised if blog posts like this are at least slightly motivated by annoyance on their part for people pushing for more "prominent" BTC acceptance even after they first started accepting BTC.

Which one are you comparing to?  It's a bit less than doge4water, but if it weren't for the recent price crash it would be roughly equal (when I checked the donations a couple weeks ago it was at ~$30k, which is equivalent to doge4water).  Are you comparing to doge4nascar?  Because that's an advertisement, not a charity (mostly funded by an altcoin startup + one dogecoin whale).  I'm pretty sure doge4water is the biggest charity focused drive they had so far with a huge concerted effort from the community, and even there over a third of it came from a self-proclaimed internet robinhood going by "hood".  If you want to pick another comparable example, I think the recent mudslide donation campaigns received a lot more from than It's also worth pointing out that most of the richest early BTC adopters probably don't really hang out on or donate through whereas a large portion of the dogecoin donations seem to come from a select few individuals who probably got a lot of doge very early.  The subreddit basically *is* the dogecoin community, whereas that's not the case at all for bitcoin.  When Roger Ver donates $1000000 worth of bitcoin to the EFF, that happens completely independently of whereas the dogecoin equivalent of that would most definitely be credited to There are also plenty of bitcoin charity organizations that don't act through I agree with you that is a great PR branch of cryptos in general, but I think some of the stereotype over there than bitcoiners are all "greedy hoarders" is both hypocritical and ignorant.  There are plenty of dogecoin hoarders as well, and plenty of bitcoiners who donate.  I'm fine with the subset of the dogecoin community that doesn't place themselves on some sort of moral high-horse.  Of course, it's those that do who probably don't actually donate and are just using the philanthropic image as a way to try to market the coin to make themselves richer :)

To be completely clear, in this case it was bad wallet software (similar in nature to the mycellium bug a while back that lead to lost funds due to insufficient rng during address generation).  The same type of bug has happened with entirely local wallet software, so it's less a problem of "private key storage" and more a problem of "private key generation", which is a software issue.  The problem with blockchain.info is that you're basically re-downloading the software every time you run the web app, which opens you up to a higher risk of running faulty wallet software.

For a single unit of money, yes, at any given point in time it has to be saved *or* spent.  But for the entire economy?  At any given time, money is both being saved and spent.  The balance between the two plays a key factor in influencing interest rates.  This is basic macroeconomics.


You're honestly saying what I said has no basis in reality, yet you fail basic reading comprehension of what I said (perhaps there's a correlation there).  I said it's the exact same thing as the government paying you to sit on your money *while they loan themselves the principle amount with no interest* (they are the currency issuer, after all).  That is functionally the exact same thing as how current US Treasuries operate, including effects on GDP - except in my version, you could indeed stuff that cash under a mattress.  It makes no difference.  To the person purchasing treasuries, it gives them an option by which they can avoid the effects of inflation on their *savings* with zero nominal risk.  Why do you think we give them that option?


Of course they're safe - they're theoretically perfectly safe, because after all, you're loaning the currency issuer it's own currency at a guaranteed rate of return.  The only way you'd ever not get paid back is some tea party debt ceiling shenanigans.  The fact that they're zero nominal risk is a key part of my argument.  You can only have a zero nominal risk loan (i.e. no default risk) if it's guaranteed by whoever issues the currency the loan is denominated in.

2 points:
1. The wealth inequality will certainly decrease as the value of bitcoin grows, since after every price boom, some portion of the amassed wealth at the top will be incentivised to either realize gains or diversify their holdings by converting a portion to other assets.  Some of the biggest holders of bitcoin already cashed out portions of their holdings at $10, at $100, and at $1000, and that trend will continue.  Even if bitcoin is a wild success, I don't think anyone thinks it's going to the moon overnight.  There will be plenty of stops along the way for people to get on and off.
2.  Wealth inequality alone does not create an "incentive for it to fail".  It may create a desire for people (such as yourself) to wish it to fail, but I don't believe that alone is actually enough to cause it to fail.  If wealth inequality is a problem in a society, it's usually resolved by redistribution of the wealth (by either coercive or violent means, whichever is required), not by failure of the currency - the only exception being if the government issuing the currency is overthrown in the process.  Currencies almost always fail due to dilution of their value by those who control the supply.  That's why fiat currencies come and go while things like precious metals stick around and survive as a store of value through social upheavals.  If some nobles amass too much gold and upset the masses by abusing their wealth, society doesn't just abandon gold - they take it from them and redistribute it.

Some [thoughts I wrote up]( between the "difference" (or moreso, lack thereof) between inflationary and deflationary monetary systems.  In short, the only differences really are biases in nominal price changes (I agree with you that this isn't a big deal, sure people don't like it when their wages go down but they also don't like it when their expenses go up) and disproportionate control over interest rates for the central bank (some people see this as a good thing, others don't, but this is the crux of the issue).

That's nonsense.  For one, we can't predict the future of cryptographic security.  Any algorithm that's secure today can theoretically not be tomorrow.  It may be unlikely, but it's not something we can ever rule out unless you can predict the future.  The current bitcoin protocol certainly has what looks to be adequate layers of cryptographic protection, but again, you simply can't *know* that it will hold up 50 years into the future.  If you can prove cryptographic security into the future, then you've essentially solved the P vs NP problem and you should go claim your nobel prize.
Scaling issues still remain.  The current architecture most definitely could not handle all of the electronic transactions in the world without significant modifications.
The game theory of attack resistance of the blockchain is a field that's only 4-5 years old.  To say we've already concluded it's secure when the experiment is in its infancy is ridiculous imo.  The current system is holding up well, sure, but that's with mining rewards being subsidized by a 10% current rate of monetary inflation.  That's a very different number than .1% or 0.

Because as I thought I made clear, supply is only half the equation, the other half is demand.  You asked what would keep it from going to zero, and I said because I'm betting on demand not going to zero.  I didn't say demand can't fluctuate over time; it has done numerous times in bitcoin's history.  The price in the past has gone from $30 to $3, from $260 to $60, and more recently from $1100 to now $350.  Throughout all that, it has never gone to zero, and the overall trend since inception is pretty clear - the highs of one bubble are substantially higher than the previous bubble's highs, and the lows after each bubble are substantially higher than the previous bubble's lows.  I guess I could be worried about the current downtrend if I thought it was different from all the previous ones, but I don't see any reason to believe that; it all seems very familiar to me.  IMO it's just normal oscillations in demand around a rapidly rising price that people aren't sure how to make sense of.  The market doesn't know how to price this thing, and it shows.  And more importantly, that's to be expected.
By all means, don't invest in bitcoin; I don't tell anyone to and only share my opinion if they ask.  It's far from ready for primetime and it's a speculative high-beta play, but I see the potential in its properties, and a 12 month downturn (and all the previous downturns) does nothing to change that.

I won't necessarily say they wouldn't, but I certainly wouldn't consider it an open and shut case simply because of a *150 year old* precedent regarding a situation as complex and multi-faceted as secession.  Things sometimes change, especially over that kind of a timespan.  The situation then is not the same as it is now obviously.  Maybe the outcome would be the same, maybe it wouldn't, but all I know for sure is there are a lot more factors than just that precedent.


[California is actually the largest net contributor to the federal budget]( (federal tax revenue collected from the state minus federal spending received by the state) to the tune of ~107 billion Dollars per year.  If that wealth were no longer being redistributed from California to the rest of the country, then that would cover the state budget deficit more than 4 times over.  While it's true that the state government has poor finances, it's quite the opposite of reality to say that the state as a whole is somehow dependent on federal funding.  In actuality the federal government is quite dependent on California for funding, so I guess that may be another reason why they wouldn't let them secede :)

If the other currency in the exchange rate is of stable purchasing power, then yes, they are basically equivalent, especially if the object in question is directly exchangeable for goods and services.  If it goes up in exchange rate relative to a currency that is stable in purchasing power, that's the same thing as it going up in purchasing power.


How so?


I'm only disregarding it in so far as saying neither is a requirement to call something currency.  Currencies can go through both inflation and deflation.


You're making that conclusion based on the fact that I refute the idea that more consumption is always good?  Do you disagree with that?

Everyone knows what the tragedy of the commons is.  The argument is whether or not GHash would be acting in its own rational self-interest by going above 50%.  The difference between the bitcoin mining situation and your standard "tragedy of the commons" scenario is that in the latter, the harm is being done by the cumulative selfish/destructive actions of a bunch of individuals.  Everyone littering, everyone dumping their trash in the lake, stuff like that.  In the bitcoin mining situation, all the individual small players are not the ones causing the problem.  The only problem arises when one player assumes majority ownership of the theoretical commons, and it's only that player causing the problem.  To relate it to a typical tragedy of the commons scenario, it'd be like if I owned the majority of a given property and I was also the only one tossing trash all over it.  No one else is littering - all the smaller miners aren't ruining anything.  Only the person who owns the majority of the commons is capable of trashing it.  It's a fundamentally different dynamic than what falls under you standard definition of a "tragedy of the commons" scenario, and it's certainly debatable whether or not it's in your own self interest to be the sole party responsible for destroying something you own a majority stake in.  That scenario is *not* covered by the tragedy of the commons, so no need to bring it up as if it's instructive.

I honestly think this is coming down to semantics.  By saying "ability", I'm meaning to imply that the government is happy to run greater deficits - to put it colloquially, "Hey, they're letting me run larger deficits!".  By saying "stuck", you're implying that it's against their desire.  You generally don't say you're "stuck" doing something you want to do.  If you want to argue they don't have much of a choice, then I can agree with that; all I'm saying is that I think it's a position they're happy to be in, and for good reason.  Being able to spend more and tax less is a politicians dream - the opposite tends to piss voters and lobbyists off.


I would still argue this creates an unhealthy distortion in the US economy, and one that hurts certain sectors (mainly manufacturing) and helps others (direct recipients of government spending, e.g. military/defense contractors, or direct beneficiaries of the money creation process, i.e. fed primary dealers).  It also seems that part of the deal for the rest of the world giving us all this free shit is that we have to spend a shitton of money being the global police man, and I don't think that really benefits your average non-military citizen much.  We've spent trillions in Iraq and Afghanistan, I don't think that did much for us here.

You're grossly over simplifying the assessment.
Obviously, like many things, this could be a scam.  That doesn't mean you automatically make a fuss about it.  You look at how much money is being made, what the probability is that it's a scam, how much work it's taking to collect that money, and then you finally decide whether it's worth it to make a fuss over further validation.  Based on those factors, most people don't think this is worthy of further scrutiny.  That doesn't mean it's not a scam (I don't think it is, but of course it's possible), but even if it is I don't think it's worth making a fuss over.  If someone wants to tip a dollar for a sloppy picture, then go ahead.  Even if it's a scam the damage is laughably minimal, so not worth making a big deal over it.  I guess you disagree, but my point is it's not as simple as "this could be a scam so we must make a big fuss about it".  There are trade offs to consider.
Think of it this way - if we found out this was in fact a scam, I doubt most of the people who tipped would even really care.  That's one way to judge the severity of a scam and whether or not you should be making a fuss about it.

Liquid assets have a clear market value.  Bitcoin qualifies as that; I know exactly what I'd get *right now* if I decided to sell.  Enron's long-term contracts do not qualify.
It's a waste of my time to take care to speak clearly if you don't even bother to take into account the details of what I wrote.  And yes, mark-to-market is the de facto standard now in the finance industry, since it makes a whole lot of sense to do it with liquid assets with a clear market value.  Otherwise you're using the same logic as the bitcoiner who bought at $1100 and thinks he doesn't have any losses because he hasn't sold yet.  Somehow I don't think you'd agree with that, but who knows, logical consistency doesn't appear to be your forte.

I don't blame Coinbase for doing all that because they pretty much have to, but it's a valid answer to the question of "why would anyone use blockchain.info over Coinbase".  I think blockchain has an easier time avoiding responsibility for that type of thing because 1.) they don't control your keys, and 2.) they don't deal with fiat.

You have to wonder however how much of our reserve currency status has to do with our military influence over the middle east.
That's not my only argument, by the way, my argument is that it distorts the economy and biases rewards towards industries that benefit the most from direct government spending/money creation.  I just listed the military as an example.  I still maintain that it hurts industries that need to compete with imports.  I think it's worthwhile to look a little closer than simply saying it benefits the US as a whole.

I doubt that calling him bad names actually contributes to stopping him.  My point is that it probably has the opposite effect because it tends to increase the attitude of "well fuck all these assholes that are hating on me".  If you actually do care about stopping him rather than simply venting your anger, you might consider a different approach.  
Beyond that however, in this case I think the value of stopping him is rather dubious because like I said - if it's possible to do and benefits those currently in power by doing it, then *someone* is certainly going to do it, and our concern should be how to technically prevent it rather than relying on calling people bad names.  I've said it a few times before, but succeeding in shouting them down imo would only provide a temporary sense of false security, which in the long run does more harm than good.  Let's figure out the problems and figure out how to actually solve them.  I don't consider shouting them down to be an actual solution.

I agree with you up to the point where you say merchants are going to start dropping off faster than they sign up.  It might stagnate for a while, since it's absolutely true that merchant adoption is vastly outpacing consumer adoption, but I think that's just a problem that's going to take time, and a decent amount of it.  As long as accepting bitcoin carries little to no overhead for merchants, there's not much reason to drop it even if usage is small.  I don't really expect consumer use of bitcoin to really pick up until we're towards the latter stages of its bubble-adoption phase, which imo still has a long way to go.

When facts strike you as "shilling", you might be the shill.  You criticize "smearing" and then go on to suggest this is some orchestrated attack from Coinbase based on no evidence at all.  Perhaps take your own advice?  It seems pretty obvious that this guy is a bit peeved that he got nothing for disclosing yesterday's bug; that's more than enough motivation for this post without resorting to some conspiracy from competitors (one that apparently involves actually finding and disclosing bugs for their competitors, pretty elaborate if you ask me).

I completely disagree - a log chart is the only sane way to look at bitcoin's price history.  What would you prefer, a linear chart?  Do you really think a move from $1001 to $1002 has the same significance as a move from $1 to $2?
If you buy bitcoins at $1, and it goes to $2, your money doubles.
If you buy bitcoins at $1000, then your money doubles only if it reaches $2000.  $1 -&gt; $2 is equivalent to $1000 -&gt; $2000 in terms of the effect on your finances.
Log charts are a great way to look at a lot of data, but it often isn't that important since if your range of data is confined to a fraction of an order of magnitude, as much data often is, then it doesn't look much different than a linear chart so the benefits aren't worth the extra confusion of using log (it can confuse people who aren't familiar with it).  If your range of data covers many orders of magnitude (like bitcoin's price history) and you care about relative change moreso than absolute, then a log chart is the only sane way to view that data.  A linear chart would be completely useless, idiotic, and misleading.

They don't control the SHA-256 blockchain, but they *do* control which blockchain has economic value, since they are the source of the value.  That's the key distinction.  The miners only control SHA-256, but SHA-256 proof-of-work is arbitrary and replaceable ("bitcoin" would work just fine with scrypt or any other proof-of-work); the actual economic activity on the blockchain is not arbitrary and replaceable.  If SHA-256 miners refuse to cooperate with what the economic majority wants, the rest of the network can alter their protocol to require a different proof of work.  There will now be the old SHA-256 chain which the old miners control but no one else is using, and the new chain based on a different proof of work with a different set of miners but which maintains all of the original economic activity of bitcoin (merchants, users, exchanges, etc.).  One of those will maintain the previous value of bitcoin, the other will not.  Care to guess which?  
The difference in value between bitcoin and litecoin isn't because SHA-256 miners are somehow better than scrypt miners.  Bitcoin is valuable because of its economic participants, and the value will go to whichever chain they stay with.  This idea that "miners have all the power" only makes sense if you ignore what gives the network value in the first place.

There's nothing particularly mysterious or different about a deflationary monetary system.  Just earn what you spend.  If you want to save, earn more than you spend.  That's how it works with inflationary money as well.  You have to earn more than you spend to build wealth.
The only real difference between an inflationary and deflationary monetary system is whether you deposit your savings with the central bank in order to earn a modest (~2-3% on average) risk free real return, or whether you can accomplish the same by just holding onto your savings.

You're ignoring the obvious point that the supply that matters is the supply we can actually access, which for all the things you mentioned is growing over time.  There could be a planet made of solid gold in some star system millions of lightyears away, but obviously that means jack shit to our current gold market.  If however we found a way to mine it, that would boost our effective gold supply.  
I'm confident you could have come to this obvious conclusion yourself if you actually tried.  If we're going to make disingenuous and pedantic criticisms, I'd point out that your statement that "ALL" assets have a fixed supply is clearly wrong (most financial assets don't, for starters), but that wouldn't be very productive since it's pretty obvious what you actually meant.  I'd appreciate the same courtesy; communication is difficult if people intentionally play dumb (if it wasn't intentional, I apologize).  And in case you try to do it again - yes bitcoin is currently growing, but there's a mathematically defined end in sight.  Not so for anything else, other than other crypto assets of a similar design.


This has nothing to do with my point, unless you're saying miners can create more than the agreed upon amount of BTC (they can't).

Because you obviously can't always bypass it, especially in these early days where bitcoins uses are very limited.  But you could pose the same question to people who care about their currencies exchange rate relative to other currencies.  Why would they care?  Why are the Bolivian citizens concerned that the value of their Bolivar is plummeting?  Because it's a reflection of the purchasing power of your money, and of course that matters. 


Trust me, I understand all this very well. If this had anything to do with our initial disagreement (over the supply of various assets), I wouldn't be arguing with you, but it's completely unrelated so I'm not sure why you're bringing all this up.


Again, that's all fine, no argument there.


Yeah, that's money.  I haven't overlooked it; I understand it.  I don't see an issue with that just like I don't see an issue that my Dollars are either pieces of paper or 1's and 0's in a database somewhere.  I'm actually not a fiat hater like many here, since I think it's actually a decent system (at least in theory) given the options we had available, the main alternative being gold which has its own set of problems (but virtues as well).  Those options however didn't include bitcoin, and I think there's now potential for improvement.  Whether or not that plays out remains to be seen.
It seems you're starting to talk about a bunch of stuff that has nothing to do with my original point about bitcoin's supply.  I'm assuming that means you concede the point, since you're trying to change the topic.

If you're implying he was caught off guard and hadn't though about what to say, I think that's nonsense.  For one, the real Satoshi would have known this moment may come (he used his friggin real name after all) for 5 years now, and even in this case Leah (the journo) contacted him by email first, called him (he didn't answer her calls), and in a later interview she claims she gave him a heads up that she was coming, and when she showed up he didn't talk to her immediately - he called the cops and didn't actually talk to her until after they showed up (that's at least another 5 minutes, right)?  And after all that, he couldn't just say "I don't know what you're talking about"?  Hard to believe.
The real Satoshi would have known full well what admitting to it would entail, so I also have severe doubts he'd have to wait for "reality to sink in" before changing his mind about admitting it.

It'd be nice if you'd answer my question first, but I'll answer yours anyway.
There's a law saying stealing is illegal, yes.  That said you deciding to purchase a loaf of bread in exchange for a certain price is a voluntary transaction (you don't have to buy the bread obviously), so no, I wouldn't consider that state funding.  That's free trade.  If the law said everyone must purchase so much bread at some price, it would be a state subsidy either to the bread sellers or purchasers depending on whether the set price was above or below what market price would otherwise be, and yes, subsidies are a form of funding.
Now will you answer my hypothetical?  If a law is passed tomorrow requiring everyone to give me $1, am I being funded by the state?  If not, would I be funded by the state if the $1 payments were routed through some government accounting office?  It's worth recalling that the primary source of government funding is taxpayer money; the government is just a proxy for the people after all.  The ability to write revenue generating legislation (through taxes and tariffs and whatnot) is where the government's revenue comes from.

I speak Japanese... aside from "naka" meaning "inside" ("middle" is close enough), I don't know how you get that translation.

Because the alternative is... local bitcoins?  Which works fine for some people but others understandably appreciate ease and convenience of buying/selling once you have an account established at coinbase.  They're working within the confines of a system far larger and more powerful than them, so of course they have to abide by those restrictions if they want to remain in business in the US (or any country with financial regulations they would be considered subject to).  
From a realistic rather than an idealistic perspective, their role is important and I think they're doing an adequate job given the constraints they have to work with.
Note I'm mainly referring to the exchange service coinbase offers here rather than the wallet service.  I think the majority of the people here use them primarily for the exchange services.

If I expressed moral outrage at every person who's political views I found questionable and/or disagreed with on moral grounds, I'd live a very angry life, and simultaneously I'd probably be an awful ambassador for my viewpoint in terms of hoping to actually turn anyone towards it.  I personally accept that most people have honestly differing views from myself as to what is morally acceptable, and expressing outrage at them almost never succeeds in changing their opinions - it doesn't really accomplish anything more than letting me vent and further turning them off from my point of view.  Quite counterproductive if my goal is to actually change people's minds.  I choose rather to present calm and measured arguments, because though it's not exactly highly successful either, it does seem more productive to me than calling them bad people.  Occasionally you even manage to change someone's perspective :)
Sometimes these differences get to the point where they culminate in a violent confrontation, but until that point I see no benefit in disparaging people.  Personally I think it does more in the long term to incite a violent outcome than not.

You and me both.  I feel like the longer you've been following bitcoin, the more optimistic about it you are.  If you would have predicted where we are now back in 2010/2011, you would have been considered a crazy optimist - back then it was a pretty common opinion to just assume the state would ban the ever-living shit out of it if it ever gained much traction, and the debate was more about whether or not bitcoin would be able to overcome those obstacles.  So now that we're here, it's strange to see that people are considering this a failure of any sort, but I can understand how it could seem that way if you've only been following it for the past year or so.  At least from my perspective, a correction of 60-70% or so in 2014 is more than reasonable after a historic bullrun in 2013 of ~6000%.  That's like 5 steps forward, 1 step back at least as far as price is concerned.  And the industry in general has been coming along very nicely in terms of development of various services and features, and healthy venture capital injections means that trend isn't stopping anytime soon.

The only reason countries like China and Saudi Arabia accept Dollars in exchange for their trade surpluses is because they can generally earn a [real and positive rate of return]( by hoarding them via US treasuries.
This whole "inflationary vs. deflationary" debate is horrendously misunderstood by most people.  The main difference between the two is control over interest rates - an inflationary monetary system gives more influence to the central bank to push interest rates down, since they have a cushion before they reach the zero lower bound.  A deflationary currency generally puts control over interest rates entirely into the hands of the market.
Inflationary currencies only work if they're backed by a way to save them while earning a real rate of return (in the case of fiat, this is generally government debt).  The Dollar would not be the Dollar if it wasn't savable via US Treasuries.

People aren't arguing that Satoshi would be in danger because people want to hurt him (hence no death threats).  They're arguing he's in danger because Newsweek is claiming he is in possession of $400,000,000 worth of highly liquid and difficult to trace assets.  It'd be like writing an article that mentions that someone probably has $400,000,000 in cash or gold or something like that in their basement.  That person would be in danger not because people want to hurt him, but because his well-being would be a negligible factor to people who may potentially want to steal his shit.  
Leah, on the other hand, is seemingly in danger because she pissed off some internet warriors.  They are both potentially under threat, for completely different reasons.  The kind of danger Dorian is hypothetically in would not result in death threats.
Luckily for Dorian, most people seem to have severe doubts over the veracity of the story.  
I'm not condoning death threats or agreeing that Dorian is in great danger.  I'm just explaining the argument being made since you either don't seem to understand it, or are intentionally not addressing it since it's not as trivial to argue against.

Feel free to post some hash powers of SHA-256 coins you consider a "serious threat to bitcoin" if you think I'm mistaken, but I certainly don't expect you to.  Probably just another attempt to deflect the actual topic :)  Tough to do anything else when you lack actual facts to support your made up point.

At least from a security standpoint, I thought it was a good test until the merge mining with LTC.  I was really curious to see how well dogecoin dealt with the falling hashrate (due to reduced rewards), but alas, merge mining provided a way around that problem.  It won't really be an option for bitcoin (at least not nearly as effective of one, since all SHA-256 coins are tiny compared to bitcoin).

The general public can't purchase BTC from bitpay. That doesn't mean they don't arrange high volume OTC deals with other companies with large BTC flows.  They'll go with whatever gives them the best deal, I'd imagine. I don't know whether that's exclusively bitstamp or if it involves other companies like Coinbase, but the fact that bitpay doesn't sell to the general public certainly doesn't preclude them from arranging high volume OTC deals to unload their BTC.

It may be untenable, but it's also a highly unrealistic and extreme example.  [Global real GDP growth averages ~3%](


Pretty sure you're the one confused here.  He said 1% nominal rate plus 10% deflation = 11% real rate.  That's correct.  You're double counting deflation to get to the 21% number.  You aren't paying 11% nominal interest, you're paying 1% with a currency deflating by 10%, hence the 11% real rate.

I can agree with that.  I don't think it's ideal by any means to have pools with majority hashing power, but I also don't think it's an emergency situation that warrants a hasty response.  There's a lot of ways to try to address this problem, and while I can't claim to be an expert on all the proposed solutions, the problem does not strike me as an insurmountable one.  It will just take some time to consider and test options, and I personally think that's ok.  A hasty change to the protocol imo would be a bigger danger than any potential 51% threat.
Bitcoin is going to have to evolve a lot as it grows, and this is just part of that.  It's going to be a long process.  I think it's anti-fragile enough to survive a little turbulence along the way.

I think bitcoin competes with all of the following:
* Currency
* Gold
* Sovereign bonds, particularly those considered "safest" (I'm looking at you, US treasuries)
The latter two are what play the "store of value" role in our modern day monetary system, although they're viewed as competitors so they're often used as hedges against each other.  It might seem ridiculous to pose bitcoin as competition to US bonds considering bitcoin's volatility, but I'm talking potential.  Bitcoin is volatile because its potential value is through the roof, and thus speculation over whether or not it can get there is going to make for a wild and bumpy ride.  A deflationary, fixed supply asset, if it ever were to become the backbone store of value of our monetary system, would in fact be quite stable.

I personally view it as money.  Money can be hoarded and/or spent; the idea that one precludes the other makes zero sense.  It's actually the balance between the two that allows markets to influence real (as opposed to nominal) interest rates.
That's still the case today - US Treasury Bonds are basically just the USG paying people to sit on cash.  People seem to get confused thinking it's not hoarding because it's technically a "loan" to the USG, but *loaning a currency issuer its own cash at a guaranteed rate of return* (think about that for a moment) is no different than them just paying you that interest rate to sit on the cash while they loan themselves (interest free) the amount of your principle for the duration that you're sitting on it.  There's no difference.  
It's a necessary function - the USD wouldn't be very good money if you couldn't hoard it (just ask China whether they would have accepted all those USDs over the years if they couldn't hoard them via US Treasuries).  The reason we do it in this convoluted way is mainly because it gives the Fed greater control over interest rates.  Whether or not that's a good thing is another matter.

I'm not trading, that's the whole point!  I have no interest in trading; I don't have any reason to think I'd have an advantage there.  I do think I understand the technology behind bitcoin well and the possible economic ramifications, which is why I'm betting on the long term success of BTC, and so far so good :)  I'll repeat, I have zero interest in trying to guess when the right times to buy and sell are.  If BTC is eventually successful, it's going to be worth orders of magnitude more than it is now - that's the only bet I'm trying to place here, and I'm fully expecting to wait many years, even decades to see the full results.  If it doesn't work out, then I'll lose my small initial investment.  I'm fine with that.

My point is the fact that businesses have to cover their expenses should be treated as a given.  "Incentive to hold" should only apply to profits, since that's all you can realistically expect anyone to hold.  Miners have the same incentives to hold/sell their *profits* (not revenue) as anyone else.  I think it's a bit silly to say they have "very little" incentive to hold simply because they have to pay for their expenses.  Of course they do.  That's why I highlight - "very little" relative to what?  Who out there can afford to hold their revenue without paying for their expenses?  No one!

The main difference between reddit and a normal forum is that forum posts with high activity will stay near the top for as long as they are highly active.  On reddit, it doesn't matter how popular a post is, it's off the front page within a day.  While that's good for cycling new content, it's not good for an ongoing and popular discussion.  It's not unusual to see a forum post with an ongoing discussion lasting for months, even years sometimes, whereas a reddit thread contains almost all of its activity within a span of a couple days.

I don't disagree with any of that, except that I agree with the fed paper in that doing all this would not constitute an "outright ban" since bitcoin would still exist, and would still probably find a small niche in the black market and countries with a weak rule of law.  I don't think you'll find much objection to the idea that governments can stop exchanges/businesses from using bitcoins, only whether or not that really constitutes an "outright ban".  It's not something like QQ coin in China or e-Gold where all the government had to do to "outright ban" it was tell the company in charge to stop (or arrest the guy in charge) and it effectively ceased to exist.

Basically, a market is a form of a prediction market, with the prediction being price.

I was differentiating between varying levels of "hot" since phones tend to connect to all sorts of networks, which can increase risk (I'm guessing you think that doesn't matter, but I disagree).  I was also pointing out differences in exposure, in that your phone is more likely to get physically lost and/or stolen than a computer.  In addition to all that, copay multisig is such that you'd have to compromise multiple hot devices, which is also more difficult than compromising just one device.

You're right that there's a lot of complexity in writing Japanese names, and as far as I know the original satoshi never actually wrote his own name in Japanese, so we can only guess what kanji should be used, and there's enough flexibility in the readings of many characters that you could come up with a wide variety of uncommon ways to write and thus interpret it.  But if you go by the most common ways of writing "Satoshi" (I'm focusing on that since nakamoto is much clearer), they tend to be either "wise" or "clear minded" or "clear philosophy" or along those lines.
You can get a feel for that by clicking on [these wikipedia entries for people with the name "Satoshi"]( then copy the character they use (the latter character(s) since surnames go first in Japanese) into this [kanji translator here](
"Nakamoto" pretty much always uses the same kanji, translated [here](

I usually argue the "techonological advancement is not going to lead to mass unemployment" side of this, but there is a potential tipping point of sorts if we ever advance our understanding of the brain and our own cognition and intelligence enough to the point where we can truly emulate those things "artificially", because we could theoretically make a race of beings simply "better" than us at everything, not to mention all the moral quandaries and existential dilemmas that poses.

I think you should limit this to only situations where the tip is above and beyond what you feel would normally be deserved.

If you want to tip on top of that, or tip someone you wouldn't normally tip, then go ahead and do that in BTC if you want.

That's quite a different point than saying that accepting bitcoins causes normal customers to stop buying.  I believe that was your original hypothesis here; I don't argue at all that most bitcoin users make a bigger deal out of a place accepting bitcoins than actually spending their own bitcoins, but turning off 70% of your customers from making purchases simply because you accept bitcoins seems like a pretty severe misinterpretation of statistics, especially since if that was a real effect this would definitely not be the first time I'm hearing about it.  The explanation that they got a bunch of traffic from bitcoin fanboys who had no intention of buying anything makes perfect sense, and I'm certainly not arguing against that if that's what you're changing your hypothesis to.  That's mine as well, if you've been paying attention.

Yes, I'm sure scrypt miners would be very hesitant about having the sudden windfall of being able to mine an additional ~$8500 every 10 minutes in block rewards.  Why you think they wouldn't jump head over heals at that opportunity is beyond me.  Care to explain why you think that?  Would they not want a huge spike in revenue?  Why?


So you really think that the miners rather than the users, merchants, exchanges, wallets, etc are what give value to bitcoin?  If you sincerely believe that, I'm comfortable saying you're the one who's sorely mistaken.  Miners contribute nothing beyond securing the network, and in that function they are interchangeable with other proof-of-work algorithms.  The main reason for the difference in value between bitcoin and litecoin is the amount of economic activity on the networks, not the miners.
@_date: 2014-03-06 07:33:35
Outdated is the key word there.  They're mining altcoins with hardware that can't mine bitcoin profitably, so of course they're going to switch.  That kind of alt-coin mining is never going to be a threat to bitcoin.  The doomsday scenario you described earlier would require an SHA-256 coin that BTC ASICs are switching to en masse.  I think you're smart enough to understand that, but are intentionally playing dumb in order to try to rationalize your bias :)

I think the best comparison is the current "risk free" rate (set by US treasuries) compared to the "risk free" nominal rate (zero) of simply holding bitcoins in a deflationary world.  You can earn a higher rate in both worlds by loaning/investing your money and exposing it to real default/nominal return risk.  However, you won't be able to get a risk-free ~2% on your BTC - we're used to those kinds of risk free real returns now but those mostly come from effectively guaranteed government debt where the return is ultimately paid for by growth in the entire economy, but in the deflationary BTC world that return is paid directly in the deflation of BTC.


First off, I'd challenge the validity of the idea that the government should and can try to compensate for business cycles.  In order for this to be a good idea, you have to accept this first premise - that the cycles are highly predictable.  In other words, we know *in the moment* (not afterwards with the aid of hindsight) where we are in the cycle.  The problem is, sometimes economies speed up and slow down for real, fundamental reasons.  As much as we like to see the economy as a slow and steady freight train, it's not.  Being able to properly conduct counter-cyclical policy requires that you be able to spot bubbles and anti-bubbles (unnecessary slowdown and negative sentiment) in the economy - how well did that work out with the housing bubble?  I don't recall any significant concern from the fed about that being a bubble until it was far too late, and I'm not actually criticizing them here - I think the problem is that we expect them to possess a kind of omniscience that I think is highly unrealistic.  I actually don't think that on average the fed knows any better than the market.

gave you some links below, but I figured I'd just chime in and say that mining oddly enough seems to be a bit of a noob trap.  People seem to think it's some sort of lucrative way to get into BTC, but most miners I talk to would have made more by using the money they spent on mining equipment to just purchase BTC in the first place.  I think that's pretty much par for the course.

I would like to hold on to my bitcoins, yes, which is why I would be fully in support of a hard fork that simply switches the mining algorithm if some bad actor managed to legitimately corner 51% of the of the SHA-256 hashrate and abused that position.  This would be somewhere between a trivial and completely invisible change for basically everyone except the miners, and meanwhile the attacker would have invested whatever resources required to attain 51% hashrate and would have pretty much nothing to show for it as their proof of work is abandoned.

It doesn't make sense to double count the 1% + $0.15.  The way you calculated it, it's like you bought $20 worth of BTC to spend $10 worth - of course that will make the fee seem higher.  You're only spending $10 of it, the other $10 you can basically treat as if it's untouched.  It's your "savings" or whatever, and is unrelated to the purchase.  The error in your method should be obvious if you consider the case where you spend another $10 in BTC.
The calculation should be the same as if you just bought $10 worth of BTC and spent it.  Those are the relevant fees.  Also, the higher the purchase amount, the less the fee will be, since the $0.15 is flat and in your example it's a bigger portion of the fee than the 1%.
One more thing, if you can use LIFO accounting then this would actually simplify your taxes.

You're still not understanding my point.  I'm not talking about brute-forcing, I'm talking about the discovery of more efficient ways to crack the encryption.  I'm not sure how familiar you are with the field of cryptography, but it's a bit of a cat and mouse game between people coming up with more secure algorithms, and those coming up with more efficient ways to crack existing algorithms.  The good news is the security of algorithms seems to be comfortably outpacing the ability to compromise them.
I'm not disputing that the algorithms are secure given our current methods of breaking them - I'm arguing that you can't guarantee that we won't come up with better ways in the future.  The history of crypto is proof of that.

You can just replace "bitcoin economy" with "the amount of real value stored via bitcoin" and everything I've previously said holds up just fine (including everything about the real returns of bitcoin/gold).  That's what I mean by the "bitcoin economy".  If you have a problem with that interpretation *in terms of its consequences to the rest of my arguments*, let me know exactly what the problem is; without that portion this is just a semantics argument.


No arguments there, other than the fact that it can produce *real returns*.  This is a historical fact as far as gold is concerned.  That's the whole point of a deflationary asset - zero nominal returns, positive real returns, assuming the economy that utilizes that asset grows in real terms.  That's the same mechanism by which sovereign bonds can afford to pay real returns.
The human brain has a natural tendency to think in nominal returns, which is why people think deflationary assets can't "produce anything" because they don't do so nominally.  1 oz of gold is still just 1 oz of gold no matter how long it sits there.  But what actually matters is real returns, and a deflationary asset can certainly produce real returns if the economy around it grows.  Deflationary stores of value and sovereign debt are fundamentally similar in that respect, and thus competitors.  That's precisely why gold looks good when "fiat" (real returns on sovereign debt is the actual concern) has issues.

Again, not sure I can agree with that.  One of the chief criticisms of bitcoin is that it's easily copyable, and that even though a bitcoin is scarce, a bitcoin clone is not.  Failure of altcoins actually goes to show that you can't just clone bitcoin and expect it to succeed, and that a bitcoin actually does have meaningful scarcity.
The only thing that would actually damage cryptocurrencies as a concept imo would be the failure of bitcoin.  The failure of alts imo actually gives the idea strength.

It could just mean their compliance departments aren't as developed, don't receive as much scrutiny from legal authorities, or that they have a higher risk tolerance (or some combination of all of those).
Again, what possible motivation do you think Coinbase has to ban customers unless they were worried about legal obligations?  Just from a common sense perspective, why do you think they would turn away business (in a way that alienates a lot of their customer base) assuming of course that they like profit?  There's one obvious explanation - they feel they need to for compliance reasons.  I have no idea why anyone would find that explanation insufficient, it seems completely obvious.

All we really know is that one entity, most likely satoshi (be it a single person or group), mined around a million bitcoins that first year or so, and that those bitcoins have never been moved from their original 50 BTC coinbase transactions.  We don't have any clue what actually happened to those private keys, and the longer the coins go unmoved, the lower the probability that they will ever move.
That's what we know.

I'm not sure about that, since I think BTC will absorb a lot of the alt coin's users and developers as those alts either stall out or fail.  Not that I think that will happen to *all* alts, but a currency's utility is largely dependent on the size of its network, so there are natural monopistic pressures that will push convergence on the market.

I think that captures the spirit of the whole "free market vs central planning" debate.  We moved towards centrally planned interest rates because the market wasn't "perfect" - we had periodic recessions.  I think we're entering a period of the world where we'll learn the hard way that centrally managed interest rates are far from perfect as well, and that we might have been better off with the periodically uncomfortable market discipline of the past.

That's where you're incorrect.  They are one portion of the infrastructure - the rest is the users, exchanges, payment processors, etc.  They are also a portion of the infrastructure that is easily replaceable.  We could switch to scrypt tomorrow and there's already a ready army of scrypt miners who would be more than happy to begin collecting BTC block rewards.  It would be like winning the lottery for them, and to the average user, aside from an updated client, there would be no visible difference.
That's one value of litecoin - we have a well developed scab workforce of miners ready to take over if ours start causing trouble.

It is, because let's say you're adding 2 decimal places and each satoshi will be worth 100 new_satoshis, and you previously had 1 satoshi, you now have 100 new_satoshis.

It's plainly obvious that a centralized solution with 1 or a few nodes and no mining can be operated for far less overhead than a decentralized blockchain with proof of work.  The latter contains a lot of additional overhead that buys you censorship resistance and decentralized trust, but the question is how much are those additional benefits really worth when it comes to microtransactions?  If the benefits aren't worth the costs, then the centralized solution will be satisfactory and cheaper.
No matter how cheap you think the blockchain solution can be, a simple infrastructure comparison would show that a centralized solution could be substantially cheaper.
Personally, I think the real potential of bitcoin is as a store of value, because that's where the qualities of censorship resistance and decentralized trust are immensely valuable.

Mining is not the "bitcoin network", it's just a part of it.  The rest of the network is vastly more important in terms of giving the network value, and value is power, thus I dispute that it's accurate to say that the network could be centralized by miners.  That's putting the cart before the horse, imo.  *Mining* could be centralized, but that doesn't mean the network is centralized.

Yes, that's why they're generally referred to as "low risk" and "high risk".  I definitely relativity.  


It's honestly not that strange of a definition.  Consider a very simple scenario - assume you have two options to place your savings in.  Option A will either return plus or minus 1% after a year, with even odds for each outcome.  Option B will return either plus or minus 100% after a year, with even odds for each outcome.
Both have an expected return of zero, meaning they are neither a good nor bad bet in terms of expected value. But would you consider one to be riskier than the other?  In the finance sense, you would recommend that someone who is "risk adverse" put their money in A, because the expected variance on their return is much lower.  Maybe that doesn't make sense to you, but personally I think it's an appropriate way to think about it.
Think of the saying, "No risk, no reward".  This is a common phrase in English vernacular and not limited to financial circles, and it only makes sense in the context of risk the way I'm describing it (basically "low risk = low potential reward", to satisfy your desire for relative statements).  The way you're defining risk, it'd be something like "Risk = no reward".

Hope is great, but not a basis for expectation.  You'd think the current administration made that pretty clear.


Political science is a social science, with a lot of room for interpretation.  It's not the kind of place you're going to find indisputable research with hard data sets, so you better get used to subjective opinions if you actually want to talk about political power structures and how to design them.  We're not designing a car here.
And to be clear, I'm not talking about specific policies like how to regulate health care, for example.  I'm talking about the basic power structures of government - the kind of stuff covered by the constitution.  It's tremendously important, but you're not going to find any kind of hard research on the subject (nor should you expect to, as it's highly impractical) - that's why I mention history as a guide.


I think that's a good goal as long as you realize it's not particularly rational to expect to get there.  Usually what people mean by that is "a society that is just *by my standards*", ignoring the fact that humans are a diverse species and one person's utopia will not be everyone's.

There isn't really anything to test here with a model.  I don't think most of what I wrote would even be considered controversial by most "good" non-political macroeconomists with a solid understanding of the fundamentals.  The main point of dispute comes down to one that can't really be modeled - the preference for centrally managed interest rates vs. market interest rates.  Thematically speaking, it's the age old debate of free vs managed markets.  I think most economists in support of centrally managed interest rates would point at the last few decades and say, "look, we've mostly managed to avoid the periodic recessions/depressions of the past".  I would point at the massive global credit bubble we're currently perched upon and say all we've done is successfully push off the problem into the future.
For an example of an economist in the former group, see [Eric Posner's interview from the Goldman Sachs report on bitcoin (page 4)](  When asked whether bitcoin could ever be a good substitute for fiat, he highlights the fundamental difference I just described:


When he says "control over the money supply", it's basically the same thing as saying "control over interest rates", as the mechanisms are directly related - the fed generally controls the money supply through interest rates.  
He mentions it might give us the ability to avoid bubbles, yet [here we are](  I think over the next decade or two, we'll come to realize we've inflated the biggest credit bubble in the history of the world, and that the lack of market discipline in interest rates is ultimately what caused it.

It makes zero sense to make a reference to a bubble of an asset with a clearly unfixed supply (if you understand the basic life process, you understand that tulips are not limited) when I'm talking about the fixed supply being bitcoin's greatest quality.  If you're going to bring up tulips, it actually supports my point, which I'm guessing wasn't your intention.
If you think someone in hasn't heard the tulip reference, you must be very new here.  It's like the lowest common denominator of bad arguments in this sub, so congrats I guess for going above and beyond and bringing it up in the context (a discussion about fixed supply) where it's clearly the least applicable.

I think they wont' be able to because it's impractical, not impossible.  Discussing the impracticalities is a much longer intellectual experiment that I've gone through previously and reached that conclusion.  It's not "just because they can't".  If you look at how the blockchain functions, it is theoretically possible to hamper fungibility, but I'm not too concerned about it because I think it's rather impractical.

I'm not really arguing with your conclusion that it won't come to pass, I was mainly taking issue with the argument you originally presented as justification:


If the BTC are distinguishable (which they technically can be with a certain amount of effort), they absolutely can try to force the market to value them differently, but whether or not it's realistic and how much of an influence they can actually have depends on a much more complicated analysis.
If the government comes out tomorrow and says that the Ford Taurus is now illegal to drive on public roads, that will hurt the value of those cars, even though its basic utility hasn't changed in any way besides legal status - but legal status is an essential part of a vehicle's utility, since a car that gets you constantly pulled over, towed, fined, or worst of all jailed, is a shitty car.  You could try to do the same with any BTC that passes through a "blacklisted" address, but the enforcement is a much bigger nightmare.  This is theoretically possible because BTC isn't actually perfectly fungible - every coin has a unique history.  Any sort of distinguishability is a hit against fungibility, and gives an opening for the government to try to assign differing legal status to different coins, and that *does* affect their value since they are no longer effectively the same thing.

Probably because most people have a much better intuitive feel of how much 84 million dollars is compared to 217,000 BTC. Bitcoin has a long way to go before it's a useful unit of account.  Most people are going to convert the BTC value to USD on their own anyway to get a better idea of how much value we're talking about.
In other words, for the same reason why blockchain.info allows you to toggle between USD and BTC amounts in the first place (all transactions are BTC of course, but $ values are far more intuitive for people to understand what magnitudes they're looking at).  
I can see how it's deceptive if you thought you were looking at a Dollar transfer, but I didn't find it deceptive since I knew what I was looking at.  I don't think it was intentional deception, just that "a 4 cent fee for an 81 million Dollar transaction" is a lot easier for people to put in context.

Bitcoin is going to be volatile for the considerable future.  You shouldn't put any money in it that you can't afford to have affected by that volatility.  It's worth pointing out however that volatility works both ways - up and down.  In the short time you've been following bitcoin it's been down (as it has been for the last year more or less), but it was also worth pennies a few years ago, and you don't go from pennies to ~$300 without a lot of upward volatility (as well as some downward corrections) along the way.  That potential for upward volatility is what interests a lot of the people here, even if some don't like to admit it.
So you're right in that it's currently as much of a speculative play as it is a currency (there's really no way to avoid going through a significant speculative period if you're trying to create a decentralized currency from scratch).  If that's off-putting for you, then bitcoin currently is probably not for you.  A lot of people here push it rather aggressively, but the truth is this is still very early times for bitcoin and if you don't have an appetite for speculation then you should probably stay away for now.  If the technology interests you however, I don't see why some volatility would keep you from playing with a little pocket change in the meantime.

It's just a demonstration of the low fees inherent in the bitcoin network.  Yes, bitcoin still has to gain that trust in order to grow its economy to truly capitalize on the benefits of the low fees.  No argument there.  I still don't think it's deceptive because the fact is, within the bitcoin economy, those are the fees.  Now let's grow the bitcoin economy so we can take full advantage of the low fees as often as possible.

My academic background is in control systems engineering. Economics is a long held interest that I've studied independently, although I definitely think my engineering background influences how I approach macroeconomic analysis.
Controls engineering largely focuses on the modeling and understanding of closed-loop systems with feedback loops, which I find highly relevant to any model of the economy.  When I criticize the inflation/deflation debate for being composed of mostly anecdotal arguments that don't take the whole picture into account, there's actually somewhat of an engineering analog to that - linearizing around certain states and points in the system.  It's a much simpler and more intuitive way for people to think about things, and is actually a very useful tool for certain limited applications, but unfortunately you can't extrapolate out very far before your linearization breaks down, thus it's not a very useful tool for understanding the behavior of a system as a whole.

There's an important subtlety to distinguish there - it doesn't have to be growth in the number of gold buyers, or growth in their preferences towards storing value via gold - those all matter of course, but that's not the cause/effect I'm focusing on.  All it has to be is growth in the *total amount of real value* that people are storing in gold.  That can happen entirely due to a growing real economy with no change in the number of gold buyers or their preferences towards gold.  They simply have more real value (wealth) to store since the real economy has grown, and if they maintain previous allocation ratios then that means proportionally more real value flowing into gold.  That's where the real returns due to a growing economy come from.

Block rewards pay for network security.  Block rewards are composed of new issuance (monetary inflation) and transaction fees.  Currently it's mostly the former.  Eventually it will mostly be the latter.  The two are related in ways that they are not for any other monetary system; to ignore that is highly disingenuous as well.  Basically, we're all subsidizing security through monetary inflation (which any fiat hater will tell you we all pay for), but eventually we'll have to pay for it through transaction fees.  That will have to happen through some combination of the following 3 factors: 1. increased transaction fees, 2. decreased network security (in terms of cost of total hashrate), and/or 3. increased transaction volume. 
That's why bitcoin is an on-going proof of concept.  Even though it seems to be working alright at the moment, it's not clear it will continue to do so due to the shifting cost/incentive structure over time.  We're basically in the "golden age" of bitcoin network security at the moment (at least as far as $'s spent hashing vs total network value), and that's because every bitcoin brought into existence initially serves to pay for that security, and a whole lot of them have been created over the past 5 years.  Once the rate of monetary inflation approaches zero, we'll see whether transaction fees really are sufficient to maintain adequate network security without becoming prohibitively expensive.
One way to project that is to just look at what the current hashrate would cost to support via transaction fees, which comes out to a very high number.  It's problematic for a number of reasons, but that is one way to look at it.  But it's also problematic to assume transaction fees are inherently low in bitcoin without accounting for the fact that their long term function (paying for network security) is currently being massively subsidized by monetary inflation.
My personal opinion on the matter is that over the long term we will probably see network security go down by a lot (at least as measured by cost of hashing relative to total value of the network) more than we'll see transaction fees go up, with hopefully some healthy increase in transaction volume added in there to help as well.  I don't think this will translate into an actual significant decrease in the effective security of the network, but I'm lazy and don't feel like typing up that whole explanation right now (tl;dr would be that the main security problem we've seen up till now is the concentration of mining power, which is at most only indirectly related to overall hashrate - as we've seen in practice, "more hashes!" isn't exactly a solution to this problem, and similarly less hashes probably wouldn't make the problem much worse).

Guess it depends on your perspective, since I think there's a ton of advantages to shopping online.  I'd have to drive all over the city to get the same kind of selection I can get from just Amazon, and if Amazon doesn't have it, basically the entire selection on the web is a few clicks or keystrokes away.  I can do research and check reviews (this is huge for me) on my options as I find them, rather than having to try to plan everything in advance without knowing what selection the store will have or trying to research on the spot with my phone where I may or may not have a strong 4g/3g signal.  Shopping around for the best price is super easy as well.  
My in-person shopping these days is pretty much limited to groceries, most clothes, and the rare occasion when I need something *right now*.  Electronics, books, tools, household supplies (outside of really big bulky stuff like paper towels that I get at costco), and most everything else that doesn't fit in these categories, I buy online.  Amazon prime helps a lot with all that, since I don't want to wait 2 weeks to receive something.  2 days is plenty fast enough for most things.

The profitability of the income stream is factored into the market price of the equity.  You're still playing the market game vs other investors, hoping that you're better able to judge value than the market.  No different for bitcoin or currencies.  It all comes down to speculation; it makes no difference what the properties of the asset are since those properties are priced in by the market.  All that matters is whether you think it's undervalued or overvalued.
If you don't understand that, then I don't think you understand how markets work.

They regularly publish stats on their blog when it's "good news" for bitcoin, likewise they probably refrain from doing so when it's not.  This is pretty standard business behavior and should surprise no one.
@_date: 2014-09-08 23:12:18
So were you saying that you think it could only be widely used as a payment intermediary and not as its own currency?  I was just responding to that statement, didn't mean to imply additional far-fetched adoption beyond what I thought you were talking about.  I'm just saying that the former use is the only one where it could really be "transparent" to the user.  It's hard to hide the fact that you're using bitcoin when your balance says "bitcoin"; even if you insist on displaying the balance in a fiat equivalent, then you'll probably wonder why your balance seems to change a bit here and there for no reason.

Because leaving behind the bitcoin userbase is a terrible business decision.  Why *wouldn't* they just do what I'm saying?  It's the least disruptive change you could make.  Switching to an altcoin means user's bitcoin holdings and balances are basically whiped clean.  That's awful for everyone.

BTC-fiat exchanges make getting into bitcoin a lot easier for most people.  The exchanges have to abide by their country's rules and regulations if they want to remain in business.  Even if you go on localbitcoins, where do you think most of the sellers on there get their coins?  Without those exchanges, the market would be a hell of a lot less liquid (the p2p market place is already somewhat illiquid, but it'd be even worse if the sellers didn't have an easy/cheap/reliable way to get coins).
If you're talking about using them as a wallet, then sure, that's totally unnecessary, but the fact is if you want to exchange your fiat for bitcoins, you probably need to interface with the banking system in one way or another.  If you don't like that, I'm curious what you think the alternatives are?  It's easy to hate on one option, but unless there's a better one it's not particularly productive.

Both bitpay and coinbase already do this.  It's 100% up to the merchant whether they want to receive btc or fiat or some combination of both.

If you have a 4S or newer, I recommend breadwallet for a very simple, clean interface app with solid fundamental design (not sure if it works on a 4).  You'll get a "mnemonic" when you set it up (a bunch of random words), if you write that down in a safe place that's basically a backup to your wallet, so even if you lose your phone or wipe it on accident, you can restore your wallet (and any funds on it) from that mnemonic.  Of course, anyone who gets a hold of that basically has your wallet, so keep it in a safe place!
To withdraw your btc from changetip to breadwallet, you would open up breadwallet, swipe over to the "receive money" page and you can click the address at the bottom (the long random-looking alphanumeric string) and email it to yourself or something, then on your 'puter go over to your changetip account- "my money" - "withdraw", then click the send button and enter the address for breadwallet along with whatever amount you want to send.  I know that's pretty clunky at the moment, but bitcoin (and associated services) is still in a rapid state of development and UI improvements are definitely things that are currently being tackled and should improve with time.  Believe it or not, things are already a lot better than they used to be ;)
Paying from your phone wallet is generally a much simpler process since most places will just give you a QR code to scan with your phone in order to make a payment.  If you have enough to buy something you want, give it a go, or you can always test it out with a small $1 donation (or more if you like!) to [wikipedia]( or [mozilla]( or [whatever organization you like that accepts bitcoin](

Are you talking about insurance against volatility?  That is mentioned in the article, but most of it is about insurance against lost/stolen BTC.  I don't think shorting is particularly important in providing that.

If you want to go down that semantic road, I'd disagree with your interpretation of the language.  I think it's correct to say my business "accepts/takes Euros" if people are allowed to pay me via Euros, even if I'm immediately converting to Dollars on my end.  The only concern to the customer is how they can pay.
You may disagree, but I'm pretty sure my understanding of it is how the vast majority of the world understands it as well.  If you told a customer "we don't take Euros" because you take them and convert them to Dollars, they'd probably be fairly confused.  
"But I can pay with them, right?"  
"Yes, but we don't *take* them."
"... ok?"

@_date: 2014-12-20 17:35:31


In my scenario (wallets, exchanges, users agreeing on a fork that uses scrypt instead of SHA-256 since SHA-256 miners don't want to play along), absolutely nothing would change from the end user's perspective.  It would be entirely transparent to them, and bitcoin would go on functioning just as it did before.  Why would there be chaos?  It'd be no more disruptive than a normal hardfork that had SHA-256 miner cooperation.  Can you explain what would change from a users perspective?


Proof of work, it's interchangeable.  There's nothing magical about SHA-256 that makes it better than scrypt (or any other properly designed hashing algorithm).  The reason why bitcoin has more hashpower (in terms of $ cost) invested in it than litecoin is *because* the network has higher value, and thus the block rewards have higher value.  You honestly have it backwards if you think network value is derived from the miners.

I was saying silver has as much to do with ideology as Bitcoin. Whether or not you consider both ideological or both not (really just depends on who you ask, and there's a reason why I put "ideology" in quotes in my original reply), that's true. 
What wouldn't make sense is to try to pass one off as ideological but not the other. They are both hard money as far as monetary policy is concerned, so it's hard to see how you could possibly try to argue that only one or the other is ideological, regardless of whether you consider hard money to be so.

You're really cherry picking and misrepresenting his comments; he's said over and over that he doesn't care about the price and actually wants it to stay low.  He would explain the quote you keep repeating by saying his idea of the moon is widespread adoption at a stable price point.
This is totally naive and unrealistic imo, not to mention based on a misguided understanding of *money*, but he gets a lot of crap in the community for repeatedly saying he doesn't care about the price.  If anything, you should be criticizing him for that lol, not a quote where you're misinterpreting him as saying he wants the price to skyrocket.  If you want to take him at his word (which is what I'm assuming you're doing by quoting him), then he's made abundantly clear that he doesn't really want the price to rise much if at all.
If you're looking for a dogecoin spokesperson who openly wants the price to go up, you've picked probably the worst person.

I was never too concerned about it, I was more just bringing it up since it's the only real security issue that's come up.  "Too low of a hashrate" has never been remotely an issue with bitcoin, at least past the first year or two, and I expect that to be true for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2014-07-09 18:23:13
I think that's too strong of a statement.  It's a reason to be concerned, but it's one factor to be considered among many. Evaluations of the risks posed by that factor will evolve with time, as well as overall risk/reward based on a subjective analysis of the ecosystem as a whole, and how it fits into the surrounding monetary structure. 
But then again, I won't claim to make judgements for all prudent investors :)
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:55:56
Devil's advocate:  If the market currently over-estimates the severity of the harm resulting from a 51% attack, then an attempt that results in minimal actual damage in terms of transaction fraud may in the long term quell those fears and increase confidence.  
IMO, the main damage that would result from a 51% attack is that people would freak out and panic - I think the potential damage from actual double spending pales in comparison, since the latter can be dealt with and fixed for the most part.  Maybe it will take an attempt or two to get the masses to realize this, and thus not panic?
I'm probably in the minority here, but I think bitcoin can deal with 51% attacks here and there as long as they aren't a common occurrence.  The first few times people will freak out, but as long as the system continues to function (which I think it will), I think it can persevere.  You might even see a situation where the panic from a 51% attack is seen as a great buying opportunity by savvy investors :P  Of course, once that mentality spreads, it will no longer be one because people will largely stop panicking.
I've actually said before that I think dogecoin's greatest contribution to cryptocurrency will be to serve as an example of how a fairly large and established coin can deal with a 51% attack.  Their hashrate will most likely continue to drop very quickly due to the front loaded distribution scheme (barring a massive price surge), so it won't be long before it might be looking like a relatively juicy target.  It'd be of great value to the cryptocurrency world for a relatively major PoW coin to demonstrate that 51% attacks aren't as bad as people make them out to be.

Your scenario is basically a person starting out with zero bitcoin, and ending up with $10 worth of bitcoin PLUS whatever they bought for $10 worth of bitcoin.
They bought $20 worth of stuff, in other words.  $10 merchandise, $10 bitcoin.  
This feature is designed for people who have some amount of bitcoin savings they want to maintain (hence then name - "buyback").  The intended use is exactly as you say here:


If you're starting with zero BTC, there's nothing to "buyback".  You're buying BTC to spend it.  If you want to end up with $10 worth of BTC at the end, in addition to whatever thing you just bought, that's *another* purchase since you started with zero BTC.  I guess we can disagree, but that seems like clear double-counting to me.  You're counting fees for $20 worth of purchases and applying it all towards the $10 purchase.

Or a shady journalist asked an old man recovering from a stroke about some of his classified work history that he is no longer involved with and can't talk about, and shady journo takes the quote out of context to provide the only pseudo-"proof" in the entire story. Considering they seemed to find it ethical to print a picture of his house, they seem perfectly capable of baiting a quote out of context. 
I'm as curious as any who the real Satoshi Nakamoto is, but this article seems like opportunistic and shady journalism that is far from proof. The only real evidence is a quote from a guy who used to work on classified projects that he can't talk about, saying that he used to work on a project that he can't talk about. The quote doesn't mention bitcoin, we're relying on the integrity of the journo's implication that the context was about bitcoin. An admission from a man who has seemingly denied it every other time he's been asked about it except this one?  Or shady journo taking a quote out of context because otherwise her story wouldn't be very convincing?

I'd be more shocked if he did.  The network needed some bootstrapping hashpower early on to function with relative stability; he provided that.  Past that he doesn't really strike me as the mining type.  I mean, once the network started gaining a little more popularity, he would have only earned a tiny amount going forward compared to the 1 million or so he'd already mined.  
Call me naive, but I honestly don't think he's in it for the money at all.  The original bitcoin is the product of someone fully devoted to their intellectual pursuits, not riches.

The credit card industry is fundamentally different than how coinbase/bitpay operate, in quite a few ways.  An obvious major difference is that credit cards operate on credit, coinbase/bitpay do not.  Credit in itself is a "service", which in the case of credit cards just happen to be bundled into the same service as payment processing.  Credit card issuers also have a bigger fraud prospect to deal with, since using your credit card requires broadcasting your sensitive info to the receiving party, meaning the cc equivalent of your bitcoin private keys are stored all over the web - many points of failure.  With bitcoin, you can keep your private keys to yourself, substantially reducing the opportunities for theft.  As of now, Coinbase and Bitpay do not support any sort of chargebacks or escrow service, which is another reduction in overhead.  From a business perspective, storing sensitive credit card information is a liability; one that has costs associated with securing.  See the big fuckups where companies like Target or Sony have to deal with the aftermath of leaking a bunch of credit card info - pr nightmare and expenses like offering identity theft protection.  Bitcoin isolates merchants from some of those responsibilities.
These differences are actually all great for the merchant - if anyone would have issues with some of these differences (like the lack of chargebacks/escrow) it would be the consumer.  Ironically in this case it is the consumer asking the merchant to accept a method of payment that is by all objective measures superior for the merchant.  The benefits for the consumer are not as obvious, but one avenue for that would be for merchants to return some of those savings to consumers by offering a small discount, much like how some brick and mortar stores offer a small discount for cash.  


If there's inadequate competition, sure.  At least for now, the two main bitcoin payment processors (bitpay and coinbase) seem to be competing rather than colluding.  Also, you say "people will pay it", but that's obviously not always the case as this thread itself demonstrates.  Winning merchants over in the current environment requires making the deal as enticing as possible, since people are generally skeptical of anything new, and lord knows bitcoin has its fair share of skeptics.  
If we start talking long term, then the whole "converting to USD" payment processing service is more of an intermediary until bitcoin becomes widespread and stable enough for businesses to realistically keep some or all of their bitcoin revenue as bitcoin rather than converting it all to USD.  I'd expect pure bitcoin payment processing to be a very competitive market since there's very little overhead - no traditional bank relationships needed; everything can be done with a bit of software.  There could probably even be open source tools that address the payment processing needs of the vast majority of companies, since it's just a bit of code.  When barrier to entry is low, there's a good chance competition will be vigorous.

Absolutely, but now "black market BTC" wouldn't be fungible with the rest of BTC, and that's a serious problem.  Fungibility is important for money.

Not completely, but generally significantly lower, and especially so for larger amounts since the fee is flat.  You can move $100k for a few cents if you want.
But again, I don't think that's the "killer app" for bitcoin, it's just a nice feature :)  IMO the real merit in bitcoin is the limited supply enforced through a decentralized network.

What I don't understand is how people are seemingly convinced by that article that this is him.  The article is sketchy as hell; the only piece of substantial "evidence" is a context-less quote about how he used to be involved with "that", given by a guy with a long and known history of working on classified projects.  The only piece of evidence requires us to trust some journalist that not only is the quote correct, but that the implied context is correct as well.  I feel like anyone with a healthy sense of skepticism should have severe doubts about the veracity of the story.  The whole part of the article detailing the scene with the cops reads like fiction.
This guy has been hiding from this for 5 years now, and has some reporter come up to his door with no real evidence and he just goes ahead and admits it?  That makes no sense, especially since he's now continuing to deny it.  Nevermind the fact that anybody who goes back and reads Satoshi's posts about bitcoin will know how security and privacy conscious he was, yet he plasters his real name all over everything?  None of this makes any sense, shady journalism desperate for a story to launch the new print edition of their mag makes a lot more sense.

No need to apologize.  I'm just trying to understand if "it's funded by the government", and if it's funded by revenue generated from a law then I consider that portion to be "government funding" since its a direct result of legislation.  I don't see that it's important whether or not the funding passes through the government's accounting offices or not.  If congress passed a law tomorrow saying everyone must give saibog38 a Dollar, I'd consider my newfound lavish lifestyle to be "government funded" even if the money went directly from my fellow citizens to myself.


So it sounds like it does have an element of a "toll", it just seems so far reaching that pretty much everyone pays it so the line is a bit blurred.  A toll for breathing air, for example, would be effectively the same thing as a tax on it.
@_date: 2014-12-01 17:25:56
Then neither should giving someone a bitcoin be considered "bitcoinism" (I'm not actually arguing that, but it would seem you are).  They both have a present value that will fluctuate in the future. Bitcoin and silver are both actually down a similar amount from their all time highs, so they aren't even that different in volatility. 
I still don't see where the big difference is?  It sounds like you're just projecting your own preferences for one over the other. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 03:55:29
It's definitely possible.  You just need a wallet that supports scheduled recurring payments (I believe coinbase does this already) along with some sort of standardized protocol for configuring the recurring payment (this is only necessary to automate the configuration process).  I can't say when something like this will become common, but theoretically speaking it shouldn't be particularly difficult to do.  Like many things in bitcoin, it can be addressed with software.
The only real difference with bitcoin is that while the traditional subscription is basically a scheduled pull from the merchants side, a bitcoin subscription would be a scheduled push from the customer's side.

I thought the double-backups were a bit unintuitive (there was a partial backup when joining and then a "full" backup when everyone joined, no explanation what the differences were and I'd think you'd only want to present people with one).  Another usability concern - it seems you need the backup file to access the wallet if you clear cookies or use another computer?  Probably should clarify that as well if that's the case.  I could see a lot of people (particularly with the web interface) assuming they just need the wallet name and password.
Other than that, worked great!  Well done.

The only time I've ever had to do one is when my card info got stolen and mysterious charges start appearing from the other side of the country.

She said she herself wasn't convinced until she talked to him.  My assumption is that she misunderstood an awkward encounter with a socially reclusive and quirky engineer who had very little knowledge of what she was asking about with an encounter with a dodgy creator who inexplicably admitted to "it" (the actual quote doesn't reference bitcoin).  Even the original story says he "tacitly" admitted to it - i.e. didn't directly say it, but implied it.  That means we're relying on the journos interpretation of an interaction with a rather awkward and possibly confused old man.
I think she was so excited to think she had the guy that she just ran with it at that point.

We got kind of sidetracked with the definition of "tax", but in your original statement you said "it's not government funded" - that's the statement I was originally questioning.

The values are normalized against each other to give an equivalent starting point; the purpose is to show relative returns rather than the absolute price of a given unit.
Having said that, on second look it's actually the 10 year data that looks strange to me - 10 year treasuries have smaller yields than 30 year bonds so at first I thought that was why it was so low but it shouldn't be *that* low.  It might be showing the actual 10 year yield rather than total cumulative returns, which would make for a rather misleading chart.
It's hard to find the exact chart I want but [this one]( looks reasonable to me.  I know 30 year bonds vs gold should be pretty close in terms of total real returns since 1971 (closing of the gold window).  It's probably swung back in favor of 30 year bonds in the present since gold is down from its peak (the chart ends in 2011), but the basic point I'm trying to make is that they are comparable.  
I think it's instructive to look at the relative swings between the two as representative of shifts in global confidence in their functionality as a store of value - after Nixon closed the gold window the rest of the world wasn't exactly teeming with confidence in the Dollar and thus gold started soaring, but the strong dollar policy of the Volcker era fed (real yields on US debt peaked in the early 80's) brought confidence back to the Dollar.  Of course, there's been another reversal of that trend around the start of the new millennium (gold rising again), and it'll be interesting to see how things go from here.  This time around we've replaced "strong dollar policy" with zero interest rates and the fed buying US debt hand over fist, so something tells me it probably won't play out the same way.

Deflation due to productivity growth is healthy - that's the type of deflation you would expect (on average) in a growing economy with a limited money supply.  Deflation due to credit contraction, while important in getting an economy back to a healthy state, is generally a painful process to go through.  With our modern inflationary monetary system, the only time we ever start to flirt with deflation is when credit contraction gets pretty bad, i.e. we're in a recession.  This has led to a negative correlation between the two in most people's minds, but a deflationary monetary system would result in a completely different type of deflation.
Why there's deflation is what matters.

Since payments in the traditional banking system are generally reversible, the risk tends to lie with the person accepting the money.  Bitcoin is the opposite.  Since average people tend to only receive money from a few trusted sources (mainly their employer), they are largely hidden from the fraud risks of the traditional system, which are mainly dealt with by merchants.

You're correct that some people need to be educated about the actual risks of zero confirms. That will happen in time. It's good to be cautious with any new technology, and that's what people are doing.  As the risks become more well understood, people will adjust.  Every indication so far is that the risk with zero confirm transactions is in fact very low. 
Is it fair to say then that you're not arguing that the risk is actually high, but that people *think* it's high, and that's the problem?  If their perception is wrong, it can and will change over time.

Because they just 51% attacked the network.  That's what started this discussion, remember?  No one wants to use a network with a hostile mining force.  Not doing anything about it is precisely what would hurt the value of bitcoin.

And as far as fractional reserve goes, I have zero problems with it so long as:
1. It's not lied about (claiming to be full reserve when you're not is fraud)
2. It can't be bailed out by socializing risk.  The main problem with fractional reserve banking comes about when we try to insulate people who use those services from the risks.  The risks need to be assumed by either the depositors or the insurance underwriters.  Not the government.
Fractional reserve banking is essentially a form of investing, and can potentially offer greater rewards (interest on your savings) but must be accompanied with the proper risk otherwise it's a recipe for moral hazard.  The problem with our current implementation of fractional reserve banking is that it tries to separate the rewards from the risk.

That's not how volatility works... volatility goes both ways.  It could be worth more or less, and so far in bitcoin's history, "more" has been the more likely option.  Past results don't guarantee future returns obviously, but there's very little basis to say that it "is likely to be less than you paid for" unless you start picking and choosing arbitrary time frames as the basis for your assessment, which can of course result in any conclusion you'd like since bitcoin is volatile.

This isn't a simple discussion, and most people (on both sides) approach this argument by throwing out mere anecdotes that do nothing to address the full picture.  I might ramble a bit, but I'm planning on writing about this topic more formally at some point in the near future, so this is good practice for organizing my thoughts.  
The inflation/deflation argument is ultimately a story of interest rates.
First off, let me address this point from your OP.


Let me draw your attention to [real interest rates over the past half-century or so]( (adjusted for inflation, i.e. not nominal rates).  These are guaranteed interest rates, paid out by the currency issuer itself, thus the nominal risk for the "lender" is for all practical purposes zero, hence why US treasuries are considered the pre-eminent asset of safety of the world (at least according to some circles).  
You'll notice that these rates are generally positive, to the tune of a little over ~2% on average.  That's real interest, adjusted for inflation (nominal rates would be higher), so that's real value you can earn by taking basically zero risk.  What this means is that the rich can in fact simply put their money in a savings account and sit on it forever, and many of them do exactly that with at least a portion of their savings - US Treasury Bonds are the savings accounts of the rich, including the mega-rich like the oil sheiks or sovereign wealth funds.  You might contend that this isn't the same as sitting on your money, but that it's an investment, since you're loaning money to the US government.  I'll get to that later on, but for now let me just point out that you're loaning money to the *currency issuer* (why exactly do they need to borrow their own money?) at zero nominal risk to yourself.  Regardless of whether or not you consider that an investment, just think about that for a moment.
Changing gears now, let's take a look at bitcoin.  I want to distinguish between two phases of bitcoin valuation based on the assumption that bitcoin is a success - these aren't precise distinctions by any means, but they will help allow for a clearer discussion.  Phase 1 we'll call the adoption phase - this is where bitcoin would theoretically be hyper-deflationary due to the S-curve like growth of adoption.  Phase 2 we'll call the steady phase - this is the hypothetical world where bitcoin has become the pre-eminent money of the world in all its deflationary glory.
I want to focus on phase 2 here.  In this world with a limited BTC money supply, over the long term the unit of money (1 bitcoin) can be expected to be deflationary so long as the world economy grows - more goods and services being priced by the same number of units of money = lower prices, i.e. deflation.  How much deflation, on average, would you expect?  As a starting point, let's assume that the economy continues to grow at roughly the rate it has during recent history - I'll offer up both [global real GDP growth]( (find the GDP line) as well as [US real GDP growth]( since US Bond interest rates (chart included earlier) are related to both the US economy and the global economy due to the underlying tax base of the USG being the US economy, but the Dollar and US Treasuries being the world reserve currency.  Both charts show the last 40+ years of real GDP growth rates, which come out to about an average of 1.5-2% for the US economy and just under 3% for the global economy.
That means, in a hypothetical world with BTC as our deflationary money, you would expect somewhere around 1.5-3% deflation per year, which is essentially the equivalent of saying you could earn between 1.5-3% real interest rates by simply saving your BTC.  The obvious thing to notice here is that this number isn't really much different at all than what you can currently get by merely saving your Dollars via risk-free US Treasury Bonds (it'd be slightly higher if you're working with the global GDP number).  In terms of real interest rates and the ability to "get rich by merely saving", our current situation is not much different at all than the one presented by this hypothetical deflationary world.  Even if you assume the deflationary nature of this world will lead to slower growth (I contest this assumption, but I'll roll with it just to demonstrate a point), lower GDP growth just means the rate of deflation over the long term will be lower as well, which means lower real interest rates, which encourages more investing and less saving.  God forbid the economy actually shrink - in that case you would actually expect inflation.

That's possible if all you're using bitcoin for is as a payment network (and converting to Dollars or whatever on each end).  If it's actually being used as a currency however, it's going to be pretty hard to ignore the fact that your money is denominated in a different unit.

I mean, you're not wrong, but the reason they're doing that (changing behavior) in the first place is because the desired behavior would not be approved.  So yes, they get denied for changing their behavior after review, but that doesn't change the fact that the desired behavior is banned in the first place, which is what people are ultimately complaining about.  It's not like the app would have been approved if they had only submitted it in its intended form originally.

I'm reluctant to TL;DR since I can imagine all the obvious counterpoints that would be brought up, which is why the post I linked to is so long, since I have to cover all the background to address those points.  So with the understanding that I know there's obvious objections to be made (and that they're probably addressed in the longer version), I'd say the summary (it still won't be that short) is this:
A deflationary currency world and inflationary currency world actually work much more similarly than most people think.  Savers in both worlds can generally earn ~2-3% in risk free real interest rates, by either [purchasing US debt]( in our current inflationary world or hoarding BTC in the deflationary bitcoin world, with one key difference between the two scenarios - control over interest rates.  With an inflationary currency issued by a central bank, the central bank has a lot of influence over the interest rate - with a deflationary currency, you can still have a "central bank" but they operate under the same rules as other market participants (i.e. no way to print money), and that limits their control over interest rates.  It comes down to a classic "free markets vs central planning" debate.  For an example of an economist who I think understands the fundamental mechanics at play, but I disagree with over the general stance of free markets vs. central planning, see [this interview with Eric Posner published in the Goldman Sachs report about bitcoin (page 4)](  I'll highlight this passage (note that when he says money supply, it's basically interchangeable with interest rates, since that's the primary mechanism by which the central bank influences the money supply):


That last bolded section is where I take issue.  I completely agree that a central bank with control over the money supply has allowed us to navigate many of the smaller "business cycle" recessions that we often saw during the 1800's.  My problem though is that we've done so at the cost of inflating the [greatest credit bubble the world has ever seen]( and that 2008 was just the first rumble of this bubble threatening to pop.  My view is that what people like Eric Posner consider to be recessions successfully avoided, I view as market discipline being denied, with the most egregious example being the bailouts and QE following the problems that began in 2008.  Those business cycle recessions of yore were the market's way of putting the breaks to an overheating economy, but now that we have a central bank with great control over interest rates, that responsibility falls on them, and I think it's one that they're inherently reluctant to do.  Central banks are managed by people, and not "evil lizard-alien illuminati jew bankers" like some fed haters like to theorize but actually decent people (Yellen seems like a perfectly nice old lady!) who legitimately want to do what's best for the economy - but humans are only human and no one wants to be the debbie downer that gets blamed for slowing down the economy.  Paul Volcker was one of the few who did it out of immediate and obvious necessity during the late 70's/80's, and the public still hated him for it at the time.  I think we consider "centrally controlled interest rates" to be a success because we haven't yet faced the full consequences of the massive credit bubble we're currently inflating.  Time will tell.
So I failed miserably in terms of a brief TL;DR, but fuck it, it can't be helped.

Can you picture what their miners would still be useful for?  I can't imagine anyone would want to use a blockchain secured by known bad actors.

Not sure why you have to go there... I don't think it's a radical idea at all to say that putting a law in place to raise revenue for a specific cause is "state funded".  I'm not even implying it's a bad thing (you seem to be assuming this even though I've said nothing of the sort), just trying to clarify how things work.  I like NPR here in the US, and it's partially state funded.  I don't think that partial funding makes them a dirty commie organization.  And imo, it's basically the same thing as your organization.
So in my example where a law is passed where everyone has to give me a Dollar, you wouldn't say my lifestyle is state-funded, correct?  But if instead of paying me directly, they first paid the dollar to the state and then the state wrote me a check, it would now be state funded?  I can't help but think that's just an inconsequential  technicality, but to each his own I guess.
@_date: 2014-12-09 11:59:53
2.) Changing block times is actually a very trivial change in terms of code, but even 1 minute blocks aren't the same thing as "instant" so other solutions (something like trusted green addresses for instant payments) are probably preferable and can be built on top of bitcoin.  There will be some trade offs of course, but personally I don't think that's a big deal, as instant transactions are mainly a convenience issue.  And to pre-emptively counter all the people who say that block times don't matter - I agree that six 10 minute confirmations are about as secure as sixty 1 minute confirmations, but one 1 minute confirmation is much more secure than zero 10 minute confirmations - that first confirmation eliminates a lot of low cost double spending attacks, and getting it quickly does allow for a class of quick transactions that are decently secure for relatively small amounts.  But again, it's not instant (and there's variance so "1 minute" can end up being 3 or 4 on occasion), so I think we can come up with something better.
3.) and 4.) - seems a bit contradictory, since you say "no real anonymity" followed by "too anonymous".  If it's anonymous enough for criminals, it'd seem to be anonymous enough for most people, no?  I'm not sure where on the spectrum it actually is, but I know it can't be simultaneously on both ends.
5.) Again, that's a service you can always add on bitcoin, which will of course introduce middle men.  Bitcoin is not just a payment network however, it's also its own currency, so just because you need middle men to replicate some of the features of our current payment networks, I don't consider that a failure or a flaw of bitcoin.  Bitcoin is electronic cash, and cash has no consumer protection as well, but we don't consider that a failure of the Dollar since you can opt for those services if you want.  The same will be true of bitcoin.
7)  Fundamentally disagree that deflationary currencies are inherently problematic.  I've discussed this at length in the past, so rather than rehash that I'll just [link to it]( (warning: kinda long).

I understand what you're saying, but that's generally not how the term "risk" is used in financial markets.  That's because the business of calculating "odds" (or expected value) is subjective, thus using "risk" in the manner you suggest (a bad bet, in otherwords) means no one would agree on what's risky or not.  Volatility is measurable and high volatility means you need to account for the risk that poses to your portfolio, assuming you want to protect yourself from downside risks (you generally want to do that because the marginal utility of your millionth dollar is usually much lower than the marginal utility of your first dollar).

Nations don't hoard Dollar bills though, they hoard US debt (in addition to gold).  Gold and US debt have been pretty comparable in terms of real yield over the years (depending on what decades you focus on, one can far outperform the other, but overall it's been pretty back and forth).
You don't have a successful inflationary currency without backing it by deflationary debt.  That's why the whole idea that we have an "inflationary monetary system" only really captures half the story.  Our circulating currency is inflationary, but if you want to save it you purchase US debt with it in order to earn a yield.  And that's what anyone of any significant net worth does, and that's what "backs" the Dollar.
@_date: 2014-10-07 15:46:45
It's certainly possible, but using a "blockchain" (grouping transactions into blocks, hashing, referencing the previous hash, etc.) in that case is an unnecessary complication. The structure exists to facilitate decentralized proof of work validation. 
If you're doing things in house, you just use a standard ledger/database. 
There's another aspect of Bitcoin that generally gets considered to be synonymous with the blockchain, but it's not - cryptographically signed transactions. You can use them whether your ledger is a blockchain or a centralized database ledger. Pretty much all older concepts of e-cash use cryptographically signed transactions - the innovation with Bitcoin was using them in conjunction with the blockchain.
If centralized processors copy something from Bitcoin, it'd be the cryptographically signed transactions aspect of it, but that tech has been around for decades, and it's not what set Bitcoin apart from all the previous attempts.

The mining industry as a whole is the commons, and again, this is not at all relatable to a traditional "tragedy of the commons" scenario.  In the tragedy of the commons, it's *everyone* who ruins the commons, including all the smallest players.  In mining, it's only the player that assumes majority ownership of the commons that is capable of ruining it.  The only one capable of ruining also in the process becomes the one with the most to lose.  That's why it's not exactly comparable.

Monetary use and stability go hand in hand.  Gold was very stable when it was the primary global monetary asset, but its volatility has gone up as its monetary role has diminished relative to US debt.  Nothing changed about gold itself, just how it's used by society.
What you have is a bit of a chicken or the egg problem, in which case both the "it can't be money because it's not stable" and the "it will be stable once it's widely used as money" arguments are both insufficient arguments, and in truth it will depend on 2nd order factors that will push the entire feedback loop in one direction or the other, but those factors aren't so simple to analyze.

My view is that if they stop looking into it because they think it's wrong, it's only a matter of time before someone else does it who has no ethical issues with it, and I'm certain there's no shortage of people to potentially fill that role, including some government agencies if bitcoin becomes big enough for them to care about.
If we want to fight it, **we should be looking for technical solutions**, and we need to understand the problem better before we can adequately do that.  CoinValidation's efforts here will certainly help us understand the scope of the problem, which in turn can help us come up with actual solutions.  Screaming bloody murder is not imo a dependable or desirable solution to this problem.  All that would do if successful is create a false sense of security.
I look at it in much the same way as researchers who look for weaknesses in bitcoin and potential attack vectors.  They're only exposing problems that are already there, just unfound.  We should be trying to fix them as soon as possible, and finding and understanding them is the first step.

It does, but it also generally means faster and more efficient, both properties that are important for small and frequent transactions.  Decentralized trust is relatively expensive since it at minimum requires a lot of redundancy, and in the case of proof of work, a lot of computing power that's not actually being used to process transactions but rather compute arbitrarily difficult reverse hashes.  It's highly questionable whether or not it makes sense to pay for that extra cost of decentralization when you're talking about buying a coffee.  Trust is a serious issue when it comes to preserving the value of your retirement, but not so much when it comes to buying your lunch.
Blockchain technology is handy for avoiding financial censorship as well, so if you want to fund something like wikileaks or buy drugs on silkroad then that utility is valuable.  But for non-controversial payments like a coffee, there's actually quite a bit of merit to using a simple, quick, and efficient centralized solution, or a network of centralized payment services coordinating through an open protocol based on trusted actors.

Honsetly, the more Doge increases in value, the more the community is going to be overrun by greedy speculators.  I can guarantee that as well.  The dogecoin communities best hope to remaining a charitable and friendly community is for the value to not go up significantly, because that's the only way all the other crypto-speculators who are only interested in profit will stay away.  If it becomes highly profitable, then you're going to attract a lot of people looking for profit, that's just the way it is.

If I had to speculate, I could see a distant future where actual blockchain transactions aren't terribly "cheap" for everyday transactions, but there can be a network of payment processing nodes working around and above the blockchain that can handle most everyday transactions in a more efficient manner than the official blockchain.  Having money directly on the blockchain would be like your savings account, and you could move it in chunks to a checking account of sorts operated by the payment processing nodes a layer above the blockchain, and the characteristics of this layer could be such that things like decentralized trust and censorship resistance are less prioritized in favor of cheaper overhead for transactions.  This layer could have it's own protocol of course, but I think the structure will naturally gravitate towards more centralized players (rather than decentralization) due to the reduction in overhead costs the centralized structures could theoretically provide.
It does seem like decentralized autonomous corporations could perhaps have a part to play as an off-blockchain payment processor, but I'm entering hypothetical territory that I haven't really considered thoroughly enough to speak intelligently about.

My opinion is that one of the mainstream's (that includes media and big business) criticisms of bitcoin is that it's not a reliable store of value because it's not actually scarce.  Altcoins failing actually is evidence that it is in fact scarce.
A bunch of successful alts just lends credence to the idea that a cryptocurrency can not be meaningfully scarce.
You're misinterpreting what I mean by "imo".  I'm saying my opinion is that's how it's viewed by bitcoin's critics.  It's my opinion about their opinion, if that helps explain it.
If something like dogecoin becomes competitive with bitcoin, that just lends fuel to the argument that you can just copy bitcoin ad infinitum, and thus it is not scarce in any meaningful way.  I don't know about you, but that's a very common criticism I hear about bitcoin - that you can just copy it.

The radical views derive from another difference between bitcoin and government fiat - inflationary vs. deflationary money supply, and the nature of the power structure behind the money that allows for that difference.

A deflationary store of value fills the same function in the monetary system as sovereign bonds.  US debt and gold are direct competitors in that respect.  Sovereign bonds are what "back" inflationary fiat currencies by giving you a way to convert them into a store of value that, on average, pays positive real returns.  China certainly wouldn't be running a prolonged trade surplus and accumulating Dollars if all they got in return was a pile of inflating currency.
Real estate and stocks I agree with; those are separate.  But when considering the "best case scenario" value of bitcoin, you should include sovereign bonds (particularly those of the reserve currency issuer) as a potentially displaced market.  Deflationary stores of value and sovereign bonds both derive their real returns from the same basic mechanism - real growth in their overall economy.

Well of course not, that's an impossible standard.  Want to know what else isn't stable against Euros and Dollars *at the same time*?  Euros.  Or Dollars.  Or any currency on Earth, for that matter.  You can only at best be pegged to one or the other obviously.  But pegging is beside the point, what matters from a practical sense is relative stability, and bitcoin can achieve that.  It doesn't need to precisely follow either of them, just like the Dollar and Euro don't need to precisely follow each other to be considered stable.


So because the Dollar inflates at ~2% per year, it's not stable?  Because if 2% inflation can be considered stable, then so can 2% deflation.  The kind of stability that matters to business is primarily predictability, secondly steady trending (usually the former is much more achievable when the latter is true as well).  If you think stability is 0% inflation, then no modern day currency is stable.

The fundamental truth is that there is no perfect solution to this problem; tyranny of some form or another will be a potential problem in any system because if you leave power to the people, tyranny of the majority can happen, and if you take power out of the hands of the people via representatives or unelected officials, then regular old tyranny becomes a potential problem.  Writing constitutions and whatnot that engrain minority protections are really just an illusory solution - after all, the original writers could have been tyranical (recall that slaves were not considered people in the original constitution) and even if it's written with good intentions, enforcement ultimately falls on a government that either draws power from democratic majorities or through oppressive tyranny.
The only real way to treat the root cause of this issue is to teach people to respect minority rights.  That's obviously not easy, which is why we still struggle with this, and will continue to for who knows how long (forever seems like a realistic prediction).  However I don't consider this a particularly valid criticism of any specific political system in particular because it is essentially a universal problem (see: history).  We're looking for the least bad solution, in other words, in our quest for an unattainable perfection.  Pointing out a solution has flaws by itself doesn't mean much; what matters is how the flaws compare to our other options.

Most merchants (at least the bigger ones, like corporations!) convert immediately to USD.  Everyone here knows this and pretty much unanimously doesn't have a problem with it since they understand the reason why they do so perfectly well.  When they want merchants to accept BTC, that's generally all they're asking for.  We know accepting BTC and actually holding them as part of your cashflow are two entirely different things, and the latter will not be practical for at least a while, for a number of reasons.
And as far as the customer is concerned, they *are* paying you with BTC "directly", at least so far as in when you click "pay", you receive an address to send BTC to, send it, and you're done.  The conversion to Dollars is transparent  and makes no noticeable difference to the customer.

What ultimately matters is if it in practice is actually limited (kind of like how the blockchain doesn't purely solve the byzantine generals problem in theory, but it's in practice a solution that so far seems "good enough" to work), and that remains to be seen.  So far the network has held up and the agreed upon protocols are being properly upheld, but obviously things are still very early.  It's an on-going proof of concept, and so far so good.

For one, where gold jewelry is most popular (India and China), it's also viewed as a store of wealth, so those purposes overlap.  Also, the industrial uses of gold account for a tiny portion of the overall market.  Its primary utility is as a store of value.  Sure, there's a floor to that value due to other uses, but that floor is far lower than the current price, since a majority of the world's gold supply is being used in one manner or another as a store of value.  The fact that it could only drop to $100 or so (I'm not sure industrial uses would even support that price) isn't much more reassuring than the potential to drop to zero.  90% losses and 100% losses are both pretty disastrous, and the former is only slightly more reassuring than the latter.

If she can support it, I'd imagine she would have included that in the original article.
The only real piece of "proof" in the original article was the supposed admission by Satoshi himself.  Nevermind that the quote didn't actually reference bitcoin and it came from a guy with a long history of working on classified programs that he's no longer involved with and can not discuss.  
So there's two possibilities - either the creator of bitcoin, a security and crypto expert who's been successfully hiding from this for 5 years, randomly decides to admit it when a reporter comes knocking on the door (who he called the cops on, no less), then goes right back to denying it afterwards.
Or an opportunistic reporter took a quote out of context (he could have been talking about anything else in his classified work history) to try to solidify a shaky but sensationalistic story with which to launch the new print edition of their magazine.
If I had to bet, the choice is pretty easy.

If it is, it's a fatal flaw for all proof of work cryptos.  Merge mining only helps dogecoin so long as litecoin is still putting out significant rewards.
Either way, it's not really a pressing issue as I don't think the rewards would get low enough for this to be a big deal for at least a few decades.  I think networks are vastly oversecured at the moment; the biggest threat in the present is concentration of mining power, not the raw hashrate.  But it would have been interesting to see exactly how well security held up on the dogecoin network with very low rewards.  I personally think it would have been a bit more resilient than we might have expected.

The only reason to not have a limited money supply is if you want a central bank to have control over interest rates.  I think we live in an age where that's generally considered a good thing, but I also think that will change going forward.  I don't think we are currently in any sort of monetary enlightenment period as you seem to be implying; quite the opposite in fact.  If anything, history swings back and forth between hard money and easy money every few generations.  I think there's a natural tendency to blame whatever the current system is for any economic problems, and at that point the grass on the other side starts to look greener.  Rinse and repeat.

You can't write software to reliably predict the market.  That's ultimately the problem with monetary policy, whether it's decided by software or a committee of PhD's.  If you have a fixed/rigid overall money supply, you have to use reserves to conduct monetary policy, and if you get it wrong you can run out of reserves (this more or less happened with the death of the gold standard).  If you have an inflationary money supply controlled by the central bank, you can destroy the currency itself by loss of confidence if you get it wrong.  And eventually, you're going to get it wrong.  I believe we're in the process of that right now.

It's real return, i.e. adjusted for inflation.  Nominally it'd be a few percentage points higher.  


Sure, but that's not an argument *for* anything by itself, it's just an argument to look at things closer and see if the causes of the past trends will hold for the future - which is what I'm trying to do.  People get caught up over whether gold is a "productive asset" or not, but that seems to be based on the assumption that an asset needs to be directly "productive" in order to produce a real return.  It doesn't - a deflationary monetary store of value (which is how gold acts in our monetary system) can produce a consistent real return in the long run so long as the economy is growing.  This is the same situation as government debt, aka sovereign bonds.  They both derive their real returns from the same basic mechanism - economic growth.  The only difference is that government debt has a positive nominal return in an inflationary unit of account ($'s or other fiat), whereas gold has zero nominal returns in a deflationary unit of account (oz of gold).  In real terms however, they are quite similar, and real is what ultimately matters.
There's no reason to think that gold will stop producing a real return so long as: 1. it continues to be viewed as a deflationary store of value, and 2. the global economy continues to grow.  Most people don't argue against the second point, and if you do, then you have to admit we have bigger problems than gold.  You can argue against the first, but you're getting into speculation over future socio-economic and cultural phenomena - nothing is for certain there.  I will point out however that trying to argue that it won't be viewed as a deflationary store of value *because* it doesn't produce a real return is a circular argument in nature, and one that's at odds with prior reality.
All of this just highlights how important confidence is to any monetary system.  Bitcoin is in the stages right now of trying to build that confidence, and it won't happen overnight.  Gold has built that confidence over thousands of years, and it won't go away over night either.

It's not in the "design" of bitcoin moreso than it's the simple reality that the economic majority are what give value to the network, not the miners (they pitch in a tiny bit of it, but that's all).  Like I said, if miners don't want to cooperate with a change the rest of the network wants, the rest of the network can just fork to a chain that uses scrypt mining and let the scrypt miners take over.  Which network do you think is going to be more valuable?  The old SHA-256 network with a bunch of miners but no other economic activity since all the users, wallets, and exchanges left, or the new network with all of the old economic players, but scrypt miners instead of SHA-256?  Sure, the SHA-256 miners will always have power over the old fork, but if it has no economic value then who cares?
Obviously that's a last resort, but the economic majority is what *gives value* to bitcoin, thus they hold the nuclear option.  Wherever they go, the value goes, and value is what ultimately matters.

More important than the value of the dollar is the real return on US debt.  No one of significant worth hordes cash; they horde US treasuries and bonds.

Real returns on US debt are what ultimately "back" the Dollar, and that's where to watch for signs of health/sickness in the Dollar system.  If real rates remain competitive, then the Dollar can inflate steadily forever with no loss of confidence, as it has more or less done up til now.

At least from a scientific perspective, you would evaluate the confidence level of your prediction by analyzing potential sources and magnitudes of error in your model.  No matter what model you're using to predict market behavior or the outcome of a sports match, it would seem rather insane to claim that there are near zero sources of significant error in your model, given the complexities of each system.  
If you have no model and are just making predictions based on intuition, all we know is that some process in your brain is arriving at that prediction, but I personally feel that the odds that your brain process possesses all the necessary information and is simulating the complexity of a market process or sporting event with near 100% fidelity is infinitesimally small.

IMO that leaves out the most significant utility of bitcoin - the first asset in the history of civilization with a truly fixed supply that's not dependent on trust in a central authority to keep that promise.  That's half the equation (supply) for potentially being the best store of value we've ever had - the other half being demand, which is hard to predict since at root it is a social phenomenon.  But at least on the supply half, it's the first of its kind.  Of course we can now create bitcoin clones with the same properties, but the question there is whether or not they can overcome bitcoin's network effect advantage to generate their own demand.  Up till now, bitcoin has soaked up &gt;90% of the demand for this new type of asset.

The significance of the issue is directly related to how long pools are waiting between re-broadcasting jobs.  If it's a few seconds, it will only add a few seconds on average to confirmation times.  If it's a few minutes, then it will add a few minutes.  Judging from the relative infrequency of 0 transaction blocks, I'm assuming they don't wait that long to re-broadcast jobs, thus the effect should be proportionally small.
@_date: 2014-07-03 19:04:40
I agree that's the case in our current environment where all significant currencies are issued by a sovereign and have corresponding currency zones.  We haven't seen how an international decentralized currency would play into this dynamic however.  Particularly on the web, where localities are becoming increasingly technicalities.  It's not that bizarre to think international commerce would embrace an international currency, if there was such an option.  From that seed, it could spread beyond the web.
I mean, this is an unprecedented situation really, so we can't point to history and say "this is what happens".  The closest thing we've ever had is gold, but things have changed so much since those times and digital currency is so different from gold that it's hard to draw any analogies.

As I explained in my reply to someone else, that's true, but the main difference is that the change would have to be accepted by the economic majority of the network (including consumers, exchanges, merchants, miners, etc.) rather than dictated by a central authority.  Whether or not you consider that an important distinction is up to you; I personally do.  With central control comes the privilege of seigniorage, and historically speaking that's been a hard temptation to resist taking advantage of.

Bitcoin isn't just a payment option, it's a different form of currency/money entirely.  The payment system just comes included, although personally I think it's inherently inefficient (or at least that centralized solutions to payment processing would be more efficient and satisfactory for 95% of use cases) and standard payments in the future will be mostly replaced by 3rd party payment processor intermediaries (i.e. off blockchain transactions).  Decentralized trust is expensive, and the cost comes in the form of redundancy and hashing power.  I may differ from much of the btc community in saying I think the most significant aspect of BTC by far is the distributed agreement over a limited supply (no central power in control of supply), as opposed to the payment mechanism.  I think people who make a big deal out of free/cheap transactions aren't paying attention to how much our transaction processors (i.e. miners) are currently getting paid per transaction :)  Centralized solutions will always be cheaper in cases where trust isn't a big issue, like buying sheets from overstock.  The real value in bitcoin is decentralized trust over the supply - that's what makes it potentially revolutionary money.  The deflationary aspect of it is why people will choose to hold bitcoin, and once they hold it they will spend it simply because it's most convenient to spend it directly without converting it first.  This is where you may argue that people will never spend something that's deflationary, but they will unless the goal is to die as rich as possible without ever enjoying the fruits of your labor.  After all, the point in making money is so you can ultimately spend it, no?  I think that's the case at least for the majority of people.

I can't speak for the rest of the bitcoin community (and have no desire to, frankly, as groups tend to have more than one viewpoint), but my problem with the story from the start is that the only real evidence and lynchpin for the entire article was him "tacitly" (that's the word used in the article) admitting it, which means he didn't explicitly admit it, but the author was comfortable assuming it was implied.  And he's since contested her assumption, saying his statement was misunderstood.  That means the original article basically rests on the fact that his birthname is Satoshi Nakamoto and he's worked as a software engineer in the past.  That's pretty much it.  It's definitely not anywhere close to conclusive evidence that this guy is the real Satoshi, and if you're operating on circumstantial evidence, there's plenty of reasons to believe he's not the bitcoin Satoshi.

Mainly they would save on the ~1% fee charged by payment processors like Coinbase (after the first million, which is relevant for large retailers) and Bitpay.  1% is less than credit cards, but 0% is even less obviously.  I'm merely arguing for what would need to happen for it to make sense for businesses from a purely monetary perspective.  I don't expect businesses to act en masse on ideals.
If it was stable and some of their suppliers accepted it or employees wanted to be paid in it, it would make economic sense to hold some of their bitcoin payments as bitcoin.

I'll answer for Coinbase since I haven't used bitstamp:


Coinbase fees for purchases are $0.15 (ACH fee) + 1% of the order amount.


Depends on whether you're verified for instant purchases or not.  If you are, you can purchase up to $1000/wk instantly.  If not, it takes close to a week (the limits for these purchases are also a lot higher).


Nope, it's just a bitcoin wallet so you can only spend at places that accept BTC.
I think the benefits of brawker are the fact that you don't have to go through the whole account creation/verification process, so if you're willing to pay a higher fee then that could be attractive.  Also the discount for purchasing with BTC is certainly attractive as well.  The main problems are probably effectively dealing with fraud and what regulations they'll have to deal with.

I'm assuming you mean 100,000 BTC - very few people actually have that much BTC; I'd have to do some research to be sure but I'm pretty sure it'd be less than 5-10.  I don't know why any of them would want to dump that all at once on the market, there's very little rational reason to do so.  The big exchanges "have" a lot of BTC of course (customer deposits), but again, no reason why they would dump all that at once, not to mention that would obviously be illegal.


Volatility is inevitable for the foreseeable future imo, unless bitcoin settles into some weird quasi-adoption state for a long period of time, in which case it could possibly be relatively stable for a period.  If it continues to grow (as I expect it to), it will by necessity be volatile, and imo there's a whole lot more room to grow.

Erm... it wasn't meant to be a personal attack, I was assuming your response would be "yes I do have a conscience", and my point was that a lot of people do.
The bounty isn't just for the thief, I'm pretty sure it's offered to anyone who can help him track down/recover the coins.  Those people may have a conscience, like yourself, and would rather claim the legit bounty than try to keep all the coins for themselves.  That's the incentive.
I think the difference in our perspectives comes from the fact that you seem to interpret it as the bounty only being offered to the thief himself, who obviously lacks a strong conscience about these things.  I considered it to be offered to anyone who can help get the coins back, many of which may have a conscience.  Does that explain the misunderstanding?

Let me rephrase then - he was not aware of any real evidence.
Here's a question for you - you're willing to accept all these oddities, but the idea that the guy was misunderstanding and referring to his past classified work is just too unbelievable for you?  You realize the quotes are most likely paraphrased by the journo (unless you really think the cops said those things verbatim - that whole scene reads like a badly written work of fiction)?  If she has an audio-recording, that'd be great to hear.  My stance comes from weighing the likelyhood of both possibilities, and at least to me one sounds much more believable than the other.  I guess that's the same for you, just in the opposite direction.

I've never thought decentralization was optimal for small and quick payments.  I think it's great (and far more important) for your savings, and also occasionally for getting around financial censorship.  So for me, this is exactly in line with what I expect from bitcoin.
I'm fine trusting a third party to make my regular shopping more convenient.  My savings is another matter.
I've always disagreed with the idea that bitcoin's biggest attraction was "cheap payments".  IMO the main benefits of bitcoin are (eventually) inflation-proof savings that you can secure yourself if you'd like, along with censorship-proof payments (at the cost of some efficiency).  I don't think I need trustless or censorship-proof payments for my groceries.

Most exchanges (aside from in China) charge a fee for every trade you make, something like .5%.  This seems small, but if you make a bunch of trades back and forth that quickly adds up and saps your profit, so you have to be more selective with your trades and make them count.  With zero trading fees, you can trade willy nilly since you're not penalized at all for simply making a shit ton of trades.  Bots in particular can go nuts with this, and that leads to higher volume.

You have to be careful with the correlations here because most of the coins who suffer from 51% attacks are ones who are already failing due to lack of support and thus have very low hashrates.  An example where a thriving coin was brought down by a 51% attack would be instructive; I don't think Aurora qualifies.

Yes, I've worked in that industry (specifically as an engineer in a socal aerospace defense company) with a lot of people who I feel are pretty similar to the Satoshi Nakamoto of this article (I wasn't a software engineer myself but I had to work closely with many of them).  None of them in my wildest imagination could build bitcoin - these fields are a lot more broad and the people more specialized than you may think.  Sure, it gives him a better chance of being able to pull it off than some random guy off the street, but by no means do I think it makes him likely to be able to pull it off.  Far from it.
I've also read many of Satoshi's forum posts (in addition to the white paper obviously) and based on my experiences with a lot of non-perfect English speaking engineers, I'm pretty comfortable saying there's no way in hell they were written by the Satoshi Nakamoto we see here.  Even his own kid has serious doubts that writing could be his father's, and for good reason.

My point here is that since the subject is the bitcoin environment in China, I'm happy to get an account from a native Chinese person even if it comes at some sacrifice in English proficiency.  He's good enough that there's no confusion about what he's trying to say, and that's good enough for me.  
Would you rather the article not be written at all?  I wouldn't.  Having an editor revise it is an option but that's additional time and cost, and the only value added is superficial.  I think this format (Forbes contributors) is basically a glorified blog anyway; I'm guessing that level of editing isn't part of the budget.
Most writers' jobs go far beyond the simple act of writing.  It's about sharing knowledge (at least for non-fiction writers); writing is just the medium.  Having knowledge and information worth sharing is a big part of the job.  If you can get your point across accurately, then you've done the important part.  Proper grammar is just window dressing.
Now given all that, if a native English speaker writes for a living and has a blatantly weak command of the language, it would certainly strike me as odd and raise some questions as to competence, if only for the fact that it would seem a bit inexplicable.  But I see no reason to extend that standard to non-native speakers, since the reasons for their subpar command of the language are rather obvious and understandable.

This isn't nearly as realistic a strategy as you're making it sound.  Sure, the current miners can control consensus via SHA-256 hashing if they collude.  But the rest of the network gets to decide which hashing algorithm they accept as proof-of-work for the protocol they call "bitcoin".  And the rest of the network (merchants, spenders, savers, exchanges, services) is what gives the network the vast majority of its economic value and utility.  Proof-of-work algorithms are arbitrary and interchangeable; the rest of the network is not.  If miners abuse their power they could quickly find themselves mining an algorithm that's no longer being used for anything of value.  
"Bitcoin" supply will be limited so long as the economic majority (not the mining majority) wants to keep it that way.  Some might say that a fork to a different algorithm would "no longer be bitcoin", but I'd say that whatever keeps the economic activity (including a continuation of the ledger) and original promises of bitcoin is bitcoin, and will be known as bitcoin.  The specific proof-of-work algorithm is irrelevant.

In a deflationary bitcoin world, you'd earn a risk free real rate of return of ~ a couple percentage points (zero nominal) by simply holding onto your bitcoin.  If you want to earn a nominal rate of return (and thus an even higher real rate of return), you would put your money somewhere where it is loaned out, either in a fractional reserve account or a traditional investment.  
In this world, the difference between investing and saving would be clear.

The decentralized nature of bitcoin applies to more than just mining though.  Miners get to decide what goes in blocks, but the rest of the network gets to decide what algorithm gets to mine (and because of that, the rest of the network can effectively make any change they want).  Obviously changing the latter requires a hard fork, but personally I think the ability to hard fork is an important part of the decentralized nature of bitcoin.  In a hard fork scenario, value will follow wherever the majority of the network goes.  This process altogether is why I consider bitcoin to be decentralized.
A lot of people (both pro and con) seem to think the decentralized nature of bitcoin comes entirely from mining, but I think that's a misunderstanding of how the network as a whole works and which parts of it carry the value. 
The underlying value proposition of bitcoin is imo the fact that people are coming together to voluntarily use a distributed ledger as a monetary system.  I'm sure a lot of technological adjustments will be needed along the way to keep everything functioning as best we can, but it all starts with that fundamental agreement and the majority of the network's collective desire to keep that agreement.

As have I; I worked as an engineer in the socal aerospace defense industry alongside a bunch of people that remind me exactly of the Satoshi we see here.  Elderly software engineers of Asian descent, with quirky hobbies and reclusive behavior.  There's a ton of Dorians in the socal aerospace defense industry; he fits right in.  That experience is what's guiding me into thinking it's highly unlikely this is the actual Satoshi.  The circumstantial evidence to me seems a lot likelier that it's not him than it is.  
Just picking one factor in isolation - the writing alone was most definitely not written by Dorian - someone who speaks and writes like he does is simply not capable of writing as well as bitcoin's Satoshi did, at least not in my experience with a lot of engineers like Dorian.  And if you think it's an act, his own kid finds it unbelievable that the writing could be his dad's, so it must be an act he's been keeping up his whole life.  It could be a ghostwriter, but like I said, this is just one factor, and I don't feel like going through them all at the moment.

There are any number of options from switching to scrypt and letting those miners take over (assuming they've proven to be good stewards of litecoin et al) or picking a cpu friendly algorithm and letting the block rewards take care of the incentive to mine.  Everyone already has the equipment to mine a cpu-friendly algorithm.


We're talking about an actual 51% attack right?  Not just a pool flirting with 51%?  I'm one of those people who don't make an overly big deal out of a pool flirting with 51% (I think it's problematic but not an urgent situation), but if a legitimate and ongoing 51% attack is launched by an actor who actually owns the hashrate and can sustain it, I think the value of the compromised chain would tank and that's more than incentive enough.  It's also, like I said before, a very trivial switch as far as hard forks go, especially from an enduser perspective.  There will be pretty much zero noticeable difference for the vast majority of users - at most they have to update a wallet.  If you use a webwallet like Coinbase, you wouldn't have to do anything.  Any software updates would be as simple as changing the algorithm used to hash blocks.




The block rewards are sitting there, if no one wants to claim them I'll be happy to cpu mine them all, and I doubt I'm the only one.  So long as money is sitting out there to be claimed, people will compete for it.  There are few things I feel more comfortable betting on than that.  I think the better question is "who's going to attempt another 51% attack after that?"

Hasn't that problem mostly been fixed with modifications to the difficulty adjustment algorithms?  Bitcoin hasn't needed to make any changes there so it hasn't, but the altcoin market has proved it can be done (not that there was much reason to think it couldn't be done in the first place).  If anything this is another example of the adaptability of blockchain protocols.

Generally instantly... *once you have your money in the exchange*.  That's the step that generally takes time, and how long it takes varies based on the methods used for funding by the exchange, though generally the quicker options will also come with higher fees.  
Since Coinbase doesn't hold your fiat for you, you send them money for each individual purchase through ACH payments, which is why it takes a few days for the purchases to complete.  Their "instant purchase" feature is actually one of the few if not the only place where you can actually receive bitcoins before the other party has received your payment.

In pretty sure Sean's Outpost alone has received more Bitcoin donations than every dogecoin donation ever combined.
I like dogecoin, but some of the community thinks way too highly of themselves and too lowly of bitcoin.  Doge doesn't have a monopoly on crypto charity; they just publicize it a lot more. $5k in doge to an Indian Olympic team gets a front page post (or $100 worth of pizza even), while I've seen single donors give close to $10k in bitcoin to Sean's Outpost and it's just an up voted comment in a thread.

I actually thought that overall it was a pretty good report.  The guy (unlike most people) does understand that *all* money is a type of "bubble" (including fiat); my main disagreement with him is over which bubble is more likely to last.  He thinks that since government fiat currencies are generally used as units of accounts in the economies of the world, that prices are sticky and thus less likely to collapse to zero than the more free floating prices of far less sticky assets like gold and bitcoin.  Historically speaking, however, his point is rather absurd.  Sticky prices are not stuck prices, it's just some friction in the float.  The main factor in monetary collapse has always been confidence loss in the integrity of the currency due to debasement.  That's something gold (and bitcoin, though he doesn't seem to think so since "anything that's programmed can be reprogrammed", which while literally true, is not a good critique of bitcoin's monetary integrity) is immune from.  That's why the gold "bubble" has lasted 6000 years.  Ironically he seems to be somewhat aware of this as he thinks it may last another 6000, but what doesn't really make sense in his analysis is his rather blind faith in the integrity of fiat, even though he describes its weaknesses and failure modes (modes that have occurred over and over throughout history).  He kind of just handwaves that all away when it comes to conclusion time, along with a lot of fuzzy language ("Nobody understands the mysteries of the unit of account or numéraire") that more or less can be summarized as "I'm just giving government fiat the benefit of the doubt".  Strange.
Aside from some strange conclusions however, at least this guy has a decent understanding of the nature of monetary systems, which is more than can be said for most.

It's not at all that simple.  The transaction malleability issue itself cannot falsify transactions, but it can cause temporary confusion of a wallet service's accounting depending on how robust the architecture is vs. the confusion created by transaction malleability.  In the worst case, the confusion could make the service vulnerable to mistakenly issuing multiple payments or refunds, for example, but it depends entirely on the individual wallet/accounting implementations.

The thing you have to remember about growing communities is there's a constant influx of new blood, and that will change the community over time even if those who were there before don't change.
Same is happening with doge - it started as basically cryptocurrency satire, making fun of the "get rich quick" cryptocoin mindset.  Since then a bunch of the altcoin speculators have jumped on board because they see the community as giving the coin potential, and now it's "we need to make money so we can give more".  If it does go through more price rises, it'll be overrun by speculators looking to make a quick buck (it's already half way there).    
You can already see there's a bit of a clash in dogecoin between some of the original creators and those who have invested lately.

If they're only running a pool and don't actually own all the resources themselves, then why wouldn't the miners leave as soon as it's known their pool operator is trying to destroy their business?  If it's only a temporary 51% attack, then it's really not a big deal at all.  The scenario I'm talking about is only necessary if the majority of mining power *continues* to commit itself to a 51% attack.  If it's just a pool operator, then it will be a very short lived attack.  If it's someone who actually owns 51% of the hash power, then they stand to render that investment worthless through the attack.

Because the theory behind block rewards is that over the long term as new coin issuance approaches zero, the rewards will be made up almost entirely of transaction costs.
In bitcoin, monetary inflation and transaction costs are directly related because they are added together to form the block rewards that incentivize security.  Since bitcoin is advertized as "fixed supply", it's fair to wonder how it's going to function when monetary inflation approaches zero.  In that scenario, block rewards will be entirely paid for by transaction fees.  One way to look at that is to see how much the current "security" (hashrate) would cost to maintain entirely with transaction fees, which comes out to a very high number.  Is that a good way to look at it?  Not particularly, imo, but there is no exactly "proper" way to look at it; that is one option.  I take kind of the opposite approach and say that the network is probably greatly over-secured at the moment, and that's why I consider bitcoin an on-going proof of concept since just because it's working alright now, it doesn't at all mean it will work well with close to zero new issuance in block rewards.  It will slowly change to a very different dynamic, and we have yet to see what kind of transaction fees will really be necessary to provide enough security.
I do think it's misleading however to ignore the fact that monetary inflation and transaction fees both go into paying for the security of the network.  In that respect, it is distinct from other monetary systems, and "you don't conflate the two with those!" is a disingenuous argument.  Yes, transaction fees are low right now, but we don't know yet how sustainable that is since it's basically being subsidized by monetary inflation at the moment, which any fiat hater will tell you is something we all pay for (and they're right).

Personal liberty is usually a trade off to some degree with your right to create negative externalities.  We all ultimately share a world here; no one operates in a vacuum.

I'm not sure where vaccination falls on that line, but I'm personally not comfortable with forcing people to undergo medical procedures and get shots in order to contribute to my own safety through herd immunity.

Any number of technical problems, ranging from inadequate cryptographic security, scaling issues, or not enough resistance to attacks.  It's really hard (impossible, really) to predict how these things will work out technology and game-theory wise over the next few decades, since no one can predict the future of tech and the game theory of blockchain security is an entirely new subject to be studied.
It could also fail if I'm either completely wrong about economics, or if centralized power sources are able to prevent market solutions from gaining enough traction.  
One last failure mode for bitcoin specifically would be if another crypto came along that had significant enough advantages over it to overcome bitcoin's first mover advantage.

Anything decentralized can be centralized on a whim if the economic majority of participants cooperate with the centralization (in reality it's not a black or white thing and there's a whole spectrum of grey, but you get my point).  Same with bitcoin.  If there were some bug exploit that caused a hard fork in bitcoin and there was no proper fix immediately available, people may look to a trusted entity to provide a centralized checkpoint until the problem is resolved.  As the comment from Stellar said, most people would prefer temporary (hopefully) centralization rather than catastrophic failure, although obviously neither is the most preferred option by the majority of this community.
The silver lining here is that at least the economic majority will decide who that trusted entity is.  You'd have to release an updated bitcoin core with the checkpointing built in, but anyone can theoretically do that and it's up to the network participants which one they adopt.

If you think the current market is pricing in the possibility that satoshi dumps, then wouldn't you agree with (or 4, wtf alts) that satoshi burning his coins would likely have a positive affect on the BTC price, since it removes the possibility of a negative outcome?  I know you're quibbling over verbiage but it seems you're more on the same side of this argument than not.

"Developer boards" misses a fundamental aspect of the distribution of power in the bitcoin network: developers can release whatever software they want, it's still up to the nodes and miners to run it.  Bitcoin has always been based on consensus of this nature, this shouldn't really be news to anyone.  Bitcoin does not offer freedom from politics, what it does offer is a more distributed power structure compared to our current political organizations.  This discussion is taking place in the open and both sides are presenting their best arguments; that's a reflection of the distributed power structure.  If it was just up to a board somewhere, the discussion would probably happen behind closed doors.  Look at how our governments discuss updates to our international trade protocols (treaties) - in secrecy, with select access given to major business interests.

It's definitely the "best case scenario", but yes, I do think they can compete with "interest bearing securities like sovereign bonds", because like I said, they both theoretically derive their real returns from the same basic mechanism - real growth in their overall economy.  ~~[Gold has already outperformed US Treasuries over the last 60+ years]( but it has some costs not factored into that chart, mainly security, auditing, and transport (I highly doubt those make up the entire difference, however).~~  *edit* - on second glance the 10 year data on that chart is misleading, see [follow up comment below]( for a better representation, but the basic point is that US sovereign debt and gold have been comparable in yield since Nixon's closing of the gold window.
In theory, it shouldn't be particularly surprising.  The only way a sovereign can consistently pay out real returns on their debt is if their real revenue rises over time, and this can only happen either due to a growing underlying real economy (their tax base + any growth in bond demand) or a growing tax rate (the latter is clearly unsustainable over the long term).  For a deflationary store of value, the real returns are directly related to the real growth of the underlying economy which utilizes it as a store of value.  In this respect, deflationary stores of value and sovereign bonds are quite similar, and bitcoin is potentially superior to gold in this function since the supply will (eventually) be truly fixed, whereas gold mining continues steadily at ~1-1.5% of total supply per year.  That modest inflation rate of the gold supply is actually what gives US debt some room to compete with gold - it'd be much harder (probably impossible for a government, really) to compete with a deflationary store of value with 0% supply inflation (bitcoin gets pretty damn close to that in a couple more decades).  In that scenario, *all* of the returns due to real growth in the underlying economy go to the holders (savers) of the deflationary asset, whereas governments are generally in the business so they can skim a bit off the return.  If they have to give that up in order to compete, then there's no more point in trying.

The simple way to accomplish that would then be to not admit it to a journalist who shows up at your door.
The only way her story makes sense is if this guy, who has apparently been hiding from this for 5 years and has refuted her numerous attempts to contact him, decides to inexplicably admit it to her when she shows up knocking on the door (and it wasn't a "caught off guard thing", since he clearly had more than a few minutes to think about what to say while the cops showed up).  Then he goes right back to denying it.
That's basically the only scenario where her story makes any sense.  So ask yourself - what's the more likely explanation for the quote (referencing his involvement in "that"): a guy trying to hide his involvement with bitcoin (admitting it is surely an odd way to approach that), or a guy confused about the question and responding about his classified government work?
If he was the real Satoshi, it seems incredibly unlikely he would actually say anything that sounds remotely like an admission.  He would know exactly what she was asking, and denying it is trivial.  The only reason he would utter those words was if he didn't really know wtf she was talking about.

Not sure if you're serious, but no one is saying to use zero confirms for huge transactions (in the future, maybe, once things like transaction confidence are better tested and understood, but I wouldn't advise it for now).  100 coins would be ~$60k, i.e. a luxury car.  How much time do you spend at the dealership when purchasing a car?  Waiting for a few confirms isn't an issue there.
OP was talking about a *can of coke*.  I will gladly sell a can of coke with zero confirms.  I'd even be comfortable with transactions around $1k or so at zero confirms.  Go much above that, and I'd probably wait for a few confirms.  Do you follow?

That's why I specified *morally* comfortable.  If you think killing a cow is morally wrong, you shouldn't have someone do it for you instead.  If you're just squeamish with blood, then go ahead and outsource the duty, just don't outsource things you find morally questionable.  I don't exactly enjoy killing people either, but there are cases where I find it morally justifiable (mainly self defense), and in those cases I would also be morally comfortable with being the executioner.  It doesn't matter who does it, what matters is whether or not I think it's right or wrong.
Personally, I think that injecting someone with vaccines against their will is morally wrong, even if you think/know you'd be helping them.  It's just a question of how much you respect someone's right to self-determination, and when it's ok to physically override that.  For the latter, herd immunity isn't a good enough reason for me to forcibly inject someone against their will, but that's just me.  I wouldn't want anyone doing that task for me either.  I'd rather deal with these things with a degree of herd stratification and social tools along those lines to persuade people to comply rather than just forcing people to comply.  The latter imo should be reserved for the most critical of peace-keeping priorities, in other words I believe in avoiding the instigation or escalation of violence.
I recognize that the right to self determination necessarily means the right to make mistakes in the eyes of the majority, and I respect that even if there's some negative externalities - if you try to get rid of all negative externalities, you'll be left with one proper way to live, devised and approved by the majority.  It's all about balancing personal liberty vs negative externalities.

That's just not true.  So long as the government can legally punish you for doing certain things, they have influence over the market.  Not total control, obviously, but influence, and depending on the practicalities of enforceability, a potentially very strong influence.  
People respond to incentives, and people make up the market.  The government can affect incentive structures through legislation, and thus they can influence the market.  Saying either they have no influence or total control are both gross over-simplifications of the situation.

I mean, it's pretty obvious that the "blockstream" group generally leans against the block size increase proposals, but I think it's a bit unfair to assume it's only because it would de-emphasize some solutions they're working on.  I wouldn't be suprised at all if that played a part (particularly subconsciously), but I think most of these people have earned a bit more credit than to have their positions dismissed in this way.  
People tend to work on the things they believe have potential, obviously blockstream is big on sidechains and solutions of that nature to address scaling problems, so it's not surprising that people involved are looking in that direction.  I personally think the long run will certainly involve both approaches (scaling the core network itself as well as leveraging tiered scaling solutions a la sidechains).  
I think pointing out the organizational alignment is ok, but I'm not really comfortable assuming too much about motivation from that.  The main counterarguments (mainly that increasing node resources hampers decentralization, as well as the bit about forming a proper transaction fee market if that's how you believe it should work) are in isolation valid - more resources does make it more burdensome to run a node and proper scarcity would help form a real market, but the consequences and how to weight them against the benefits are what is at dispute, and this is a highly speculative trade off that no one *knows* the actual answer to, as this is an ongoing experiment.  Differing opinions are expected.

From my perspective, the problem here is the idea of limited liability provided by corporate shields.  I know the justification is given as "otherwise we wouldn't have big companies and benefit from efficiencies of scale" but I'm not at all convinced that the benefits from that outweigh the consequences of limited liability and/or the regulations that follow. 
To borrow some Marvel wisdom, "With great power comes great responsibility".  Our problems here start when we try to remove the "responsibility" part of that in the name of encouraging growth.  That encourages a very fundamental moral hazard and I think trying to make up for it with regulatory structures is just piling bad ideas on top of bad ideas.  Liability should always be traceable to actual people.  If you don't want the liability, don't take on power and responsibility.  The two imo should be inseparable.

If you truly feel that way, then it's probably not worth continuing this discussion since I think the legal system *is* a [protocol]( (namely "a system of rules that explain the correct conduct and procedures to be followed in formal situations") that a critical majority (not necessarily a simple majority) of people agree to accept, so no, I can not end the topic there.  If a critical majority of people opposed our current legal system, there could be a *violent* and potentially successful revolution (at least from a balance of power perspective rather than a general welfare perspective), and that understanding is critical to the rest of my point of view.
If you think my point of view is a result of a lack of education, then I have no recourse other than to assure you it's not.

Gold standard and gold money (as in actual coinage) aren't the same thing.  The gold standard was (at least in every relatively modern, large scale implementation I know of) a fractional reserve system of bank notes representing gold, and anytime you have a fractional reserve system without a lender of last resort (no one can conjure up more gold out of thin air), you have a system designed to fail due to an inherent instability (one bank run and it's over).  The US ended the international gold standard in 1971 not because "it was volatile", but because our [gold reserves were being steadily drained]( and we knew this wasn't a sustainable system.  That's the instability that was problematic with the gold standard, and it's separate from any volatility inherent in the commodity.
The only time "volatility" was a problem with actual gold money (as in gold coinage) was due to immense and historically quite rare supply shocks such as the discovery and theft of massive amounts of gold from the "new world".  That's one thing about commodity money that bitcoin attempts to solve - supply shocks.  The other half of the equation however is demand, and demand for bitcoin is and will remain volatile for the foreseeable future, but that doesn't mean it can't ever stabilize.  If demand ever stabilizes, so will the price, because supply is completely predictable.

I don't really disagree with any of that, I just draw the line at injecting people with things against their will; perception is people's reality and that must be a pretty horrible psychological experience for people to go through, no matter how wrong they are about the scientific reality.  My litmus test for whether society should do something is whether I would be morally comfortable being the one doing it, and I certainly wouldn't be comfortable forcibly injecting people and/or their children with vaccines.  Would you?  If you knew someone was refusing, would you feel morally in the right to physically restrain them and do it?  If you wouldn't, then don't task the government to do it either.  If you would be comfortable doing it, then maybe we're just very different people, as I find the idea rather morally repellant.
I'm all for allowing schools to ban unvaccinated children, that's what I mean by social stratification.  I'd rather compel anti-vaccers to vaccinate by making it difficult for them to integrate with the rest of vaccinated society otherwise.  I'm just trying to avoid the dystopian scenario where you actually have to forcibly inject someone with something, no matter how harmless.  I think the psychological damage that can result from such an episode (remember, these people actually believe their government is trying to inject them with something potentially harmful/poisonous, and even if they're wrong, that determines how they experience it) isn't necessarily less than the immunological consequences of forgoing some vaccination.

Um... who's talking about government agencies and legal restrictions?  I'm talking about a voluntary boycott - that's the topic being discussed here.  How does that relate at all to what you just said?  I think you're seriously confusing some issues here; no one is forcing anyone to do anything.  Boycotting is the opposite of force; it's voting with your wallet which is how it should be done imo.  Is it an effort to persuade?  Absolutely.  Not at all the same thing as force, however, no more than I'm "forcing" a business to do something by shopping at their competitor.
And again, I'm not at all saying this is something you have to do, if that's not clear.  I'm just explaining the reasoning for it.

The price isn't a problem for anyone to solve.  It's going to be volatile until demand for bitcoin stabilizes, which I don't expect to happen anytime soon.  In the meantime, the price is going to vary widely based on the sentiment of the market, so (for the millionth time) don't invest any money that you aren't comfortable exposing to that kind of volatility.  If you follow that simple advice, you don't have a "problem", and if you don't do that, the real problem is your financial management.  Always understand the risk profiles of what you're investing in, and manage your risk accordingly.  
Obviously anyone investing in bitcoin is probably a long term optimist, but if you think being down 70% after a year is outside the realm of possibilities, then you really don't understand what you're investing in, and there's the problem that needs to be solved.

I'm certainly not trying to prove anything, this is an entirely subjective value judgement.  


While I agree, I think that's a rather generous way of characterizing the payment for sponsorship of, along with a speaking arrangement at, a conference.  This arrangement resembles paid advertising imo much more than "free and open access to information", with the general idea behind a good conference being that you give publicity to interesting and relevant ideas to the topic of the conference.  But it's all paid for, make no mistake about that, and whether the event ends up a net "positive" or not depends on the good judgement of the organizers, imo.


I'm not worried about shady people trying to trick me.  I am concerned with not helping shady people trick others.  That's due to my own values, and I reserve the right to judge others in whatever way I see appropriate for not sharing those values.  Obviously I can't force them to share my values, but I can certainly control my association with others.  That's what a boycott is about - a voluntary and non-violent way of expressing disapproval of some entity's actions.  Whether or not an entity maintaining business associations with likely scammers is a problem for you is entirely up to you.


I don't disagree with that, but I don't consider that mutually exclusive with the thought that accepting conference sponsorship from at least what I consider to be a pretty obvious scam is a mistake as well.  If someone comes trying to sell me something that I think is obviously stolen, I personally would not buy it as doing so would be against my personal values and thus I would consider it a mistake.  This has the added benefit of contributing to lower demand for stolen goods, and lower demand = lower value and thus a lower incentive to steal (it may be an incremental effect, but incremental is not zero).  This all has nothing to do with any mistake the original owner may have made with getting it stolen.  The two mistakes are not mutually exclusive, and just because someone made a mistake earlier, I don't see how that justifies me making one now.

And "the community" involves the organizers of the conference as well.  Tacking on a Q&amp;A to a paid sponsorship/speaking arrangement is hardly what I'd call standing up against shit.
If you (or the organizers in this case) think self regulation is everyone *else's* responsibility (can't have pesky ethics interfering with the bottom line when you're trying to run a business!), then you don't understand self regulation and your reputation will rightfully suffer for it.  That's what's happening here.  If the organizers don't consider themselves part of the community responsible for standing up against this (and no, a friggin Q&amp;A does not count when you're still taking their money and advertising for them in your conference), then they'll be treated accordingly, and I think that's completely fair.

Will we still have a central bank with control over the money supply?
Because if you do, there's no need for a blockchain.  A centralized ledger would be more efficient, and there's no reason to be concerned about trust if you're already trusting a central bank with control over the money supply.  If you're doing that, might as well trust them to prevent double spends as well.
A crypto with a central bank (basically all this would be is the current monetary system with a cryptographically secured payment protocol overseen by a central bank) is a very different thing than bitcoin.  The technology to do the former has actually been around since the 80's/90's.

Plenty of alts have already addressed deficiencies with the original bitcoin difficulty adjustment algorithm, we just haven't bothered with bitcoin yet since it hasn't been necessary.  There's no rush to hard fork for low priority fixes, but if it becomes high priority then there's more motivation to fork.

Regulated fiat-crypto exchanges (i.e. "gateways") are not synonymous with being pro-classic or whatever just because Coinbase is.  Gemini is also a regulated gateway and the winklevii seem to favor core.  I don't know the official position of all regulated exchanges but I'm sure it's a mixed bag.  If anything, Coinbase's blocksize stance is probably motivated more by the wallet/payments aspects of their business than the exchange side.  Exchange deposits/withdrawls tend to be relatively high value transactions where a $.10 fee (pretty high by current standards) is negligible.  Higher fees would only really be significant friction for low value payments.
These gateways are very useful to a lot of people in facilitating their use of bitcoin.  Things would probably progress a lot slower without them, and best of all, you don't have to use them if you don't want to.  CEO's opinions on blocksize are an independent matter of whether or not these gateways are useful.

No one wants the conference to be cancelled.  What people want is for the organizers of the conference to stand up to scammy bullshit (i.e., don't take money from them in exchange for publicity via the conference).  Eric himself said "the community" should stand up against shit, and the community is reminding the organizers of the conference that if they want to be considered as "part of the community", then they have to do their part to stand up against shit.  That's how self-regulation works - it's everyone's responsibility, including organizers of a conference, and the way that responsibility is enforced is through community perception of your reputation.  Tacking on a Q&amp;A session to the end of a paid sponsorship/speaking arrangement hardly counts.

If you're only talking about the last year, then of course, it's been a yearlong bear trend.  But if you're using yearlong trends to make assumptions about the future, then you're making the exact same mistake people made in assuming 6000% growth would continue steadily after last year.

Ordering plans would be a contract service. If you don't pay someone for their service that you ordered, that's breach of contract. Bad example. A babysitter doesn't produce anything tangible but that doesn't mean you don't have to pay them for their work.  Same goes for pretty much any service job. 
The IP argument is different, it's about the information itself, not the service of hiring someone to create it.  In your architecture example, the thematic analogue would be whether or not you can "own" a specific floor plan.

How is voluntarily refusing to go to a conference "restricting access without permission"?  I honestly have no clue what you're talking about, imo it's the exact opposite.  It's a voluntary and peaceful protest, which is the epitome of *not* force.  It's just bizarre, so I apologize if I sound frustrated, but it's strange having you characterize my arguments as the exact opposite of what I feel I'm actually saying.  No one is forcing anyone to do anything, unless you consider me electing to go to Burger King as "forcing" Mcdonald's to go out of business or change their business practices.  Your voluntary business interactions are not forceful, that's my point, it's actually in integral part of market self regulation and the precise reason why I don't feel you *need* forceful central regulation for this kind of thing.  It's just truly strange to see you characterize voluntary boycotts as "forceful regulations".  It's hard to argue when I feel like the very definitions you're using are completely backwards.

Yeah, but no one was talking about "force" until you brought it up so I fail to see the relevance.  And I'll re-iterate that I think "access to information" is a pretty generous way to characterize a sponsorship.  You understand Garza is *paying* for this privilege, right?  Because he feels he gets something in return (it's probably for the air of legitimacy it gives to his scam).

Exchanges (at least ones with fiat) aren't pure Bitcoin/crypto currency products. They are gateways into that world, but that means they have one foot in the traditional financial system, and that has proven to make decentralization difficult.  Fiat transactions aren't very decentralization friendly. Imo this is a rather necessary intermediate step until the crypto-only economy reaches critical mass, which is still a very long ways off, but building good interfaces between the old and the new is how we'll get there. The more you can stay within a crypto economy, the less you will need fiat exchanges, but for now they are an invaluable stepping stone. This isn't a gap you want to try to cross in one leap.

The problem isn't "central planning" per se, it's centralizing systems to the point where they become "too big to fail".  Central planning is generally a very competitive way to operate a system (that's why companies have CEO's, sports teams have coaches and general managers, etc.), but anything can fail and maintaining robustness against failure means not putting all your eggs in one basket.  
Some systems with a strong network effect have a natural tendency to converge (and you want that to an extent since it comes with efficiency advantages), but you can still vary the degree to which control over the system is centralized or not.

When I suspect that the market in general is operating suboptimally, my first instinct is to look for the error in my own understanding. It would take a good deal of research and the development of a detailed and comprehensive business plan before I'd be willing to bet that I know better than the market, and even then you'll often find out from trying that you were wrong and that you had overlooked some detail.

Do you think organizers of the conference should have any standards in who they choose as sponsors/speakers other than "highest bidder"?  I believe people have the right to choose who they do business with, and part of that is I hold you responsible for who you choose to do business with (within reason, of course, as there are always certain levels of justifiable ignorance).  People are throwing a fit because most people think this is becoming one of the most obvious scams in crypto history (which is saying a lot) and yet organizers of a prominent bitcoin conference don't seem to feel they have any liability in engaging in a cooperative business relationship with it.  In reality they do (their reputation depends on it), and talks of a boycott are one of the consequences.

If that's the case, he should just say "I'm contractually obligated to allow him to speak at this point, sorry guys but there's not much I can do other than give you guys the ability to ask questions back to him, which I encourage you all to do".  If he legally can't back out (at least without significant litigation that he very well may lose), then I'm sure people would understand.  What I don't understand is why he wouldn't just say so.  This whole idea that it's a "good" thing to accept sponsorship money and advertise for a scam so long as you offer a Q&amp;A session at the end is what stinks to me.  That's not a virtue, it's an unfortunate contractual obligation, so call a spade a spade.  Trying to spin this as some sort of noble effort is where he loses me.

Of course, what I (and each and every one of us, including the organizers of BTC miami) get to do is choose who we do business with.  I wouldn't do business with Josh Garza; it sounds like you wouldn't either.  The organizers of BTC Miami, however, would.  Why the discrepancy?  That apparent difference in values makes me hesitant to do business with BTC miami as well, which would mean not supporting their conference.  So in other words, I do (up to a certain extent) get to decide what everyone else is responsible for in so far as I get to control my relationship with them, including whether or not I do business with them.  It doesn't extend beyond that, but it certainly does extend that far.  That's entirely under my control, and thus my responsibility.  


I highly doubt the attendees of the conference are his main target.  His target audience, at least imo, is naive internet denizens who are more likely to believe in the legitimacy of his operation due to its association with a very legitimate sounding bitcoin conference.  An air of legitimacy is invaluable to a scam, after all, and that's what I believe he is purchasing.  Of course, if the whole thing blows up publicly enough then it could end up hurting their operation regardless, but the fact is anyone willing to think critically about their operation should be pretty alarmed by the whole thing, so I doubt critical thinkers are their target audience.  They're going after the lowest common denominator, and simply being associated with a "major" conference helps him earn credibility with that faction imo.  It's one (small) step up from the target demographic of nigerian prince emails.  I just looked at the "hashtalk" website today and the first thread I saw was a 16 year old kid telling people to have faith in their investment.  That's probably more indicative of the target demographic than the attendees of a $300/head bitcoin conference, and being listed as a sponsor/speaker there probably helps convince that kid this is legit.

And people are asking the organizers of BTC miami to do just that.  Garza doesn't have a "right" to be a sponsor or speak there; that's entirely up to the organizers.  Refusing his business does not restrict his freedoms anymore than you refusing to do business with him does.  They're voluntarily providing him their services, which is publicity and advertising space at a prominent bitcoin conference.
Self regulation is everyone's responsibility (not everyone *else's*), and what keeps it that way is reputation.  You knowingly do business with scammers and you risk your own reputation; that's how it should be.  You don't get to skirt that responsibility just because you're organizing a large conference.  That actually makes the responsibility that much more crucial.

I also don't have a problem with the fact that my bitcoin holdings are worth considerably less than they were a year ago, so I don't see the need to resort to your kind of logic to justify it.  Bitcoin is volatile, that's fine.  That means the value of your holdings will go up and down; no need to try to hide the fact with borderline tautological logic.

Not living paycheck to paycheck has as much to do with your financial discipline as it does with your raw income.

Well considering the only reason this is an issue in the first place is apparently a bunch of miners decided to destroy their livelihood...
That's why I'm not worried about it in the first place.  Your argument is basically since one group decided to act suicidally, the others will as well.  My take on it is that I don't expect the first group to act suicidally, and if for some bizarre reason they do, I expect the second to be a little smarter. 


So tell me - do you actually think these cashed up bad actors somehow profit by forcing themselves to purchase a whole new set of equipment?  Because the missing piece of your theory here is how exactly those bad actors profited from the double spend.  Just because it's attempted, doesn't mean you actually get anything out of it.  An exchange would have to really be asleep at the wheel to let anyone trade and withdraw profitably from all of this.

He's not standing up to this bullshit.  Instead he's doing business with them.  Business is a voluntary cooperative act, and if you voluntarily cooperate with scammy entities you risk your own reputation.  That's how reputation based self regulation works.  It's not just due to losing business from customers due to poor reputation, but from losing business relationships as well since they don't want to work with you.  The community doesn't feel the organizers of btc miami are doing their fair part in self regulating our industry, and thus their own reputation is suffering for it.
Having freedom over who you do business with goes hand in hand with having responsibility for who you do business with.

A decentralized exchange has proven to be rather difficult to implement since a btc-fiat exchange has to interface with the fiat monetary system, which is rather incompatible with decentralized methods of transaction.  Wallet services are another matter, and you seem to be conflating exchange services with wallet services.  Coinbase offers both, so if you have a problem with their wallet services (note that they have fundamentally two options, their "standard" wallet that relinquishes control over private keys, and their multi-sig wallet that in simplistic terms is blockchain.info-ish in control structure), just recommend people don't use them as a wallet, but in terms of exchanges we don't really have decentralized options that are as effective as their centralized alternatives due to the existing restrictions in fiat transfers.

For average joe, it's not a huge difference or anything, but for large volume traders and institutional users it's a big upgrade.

Those benefits sound like they're derived from using cryptographic signatures to represent and transfer ownership.  While that's an important part of bitcoin, it's not a new idea and has been a part of e-cash proposals going back to the 80's.  Those systems however all relied on a trusted middle man to prevent double spending.  Bitcoin's primary innovation was precisely to eliminate the trusted middle man by using a PoW blockchain.
You say that:


The whole point of the blockchain structure in bitcoin was to provide that trustlessness.  It's still not clear to me why you'd want to use a blockchain if you have no desire to eliminate a trusted middle man, since that's its very purpose.

It's a hole in any argument about centralization vs scaling, whether the argument is that it will be ok or it won't.  It's just as hard to show that bitcoin will be decentralized enough as it will be to show that it won't; it's not an easily quantifiable quality.  We won't really find out if Bitcoin is "decentralized enough" until we fight serious censorship attempts from powerful global entities.

The problem is looking at it as a discrete event where all of a sudden bitcoin is hundreds of thousands of Dollars and everyone who is buying now still has all their btc and is looking to sell.  As someone who thinks those types of valuations are *possible* (I'm not saying likely, just theoretically possible if a lot of things go right for bitcoin), the path to get there would probably span decades, and along the way people will be buying/selling and expectations regarding what the "fair value" of bitcoin (or a "bit") is would gradually change as well.  You don't get to $500k without first going through $5k, $10k, $50k, etc., and all along that path you will have people "cashing out" and others buying in, just like up till now we've had early adopters cashing out at $5 and others buying in at $1000, and how now some people think $200 bitcoin is relatively cheap whereas a couple years ago everyone would have considered it incredibly high.  Expectations/perceptions change over time.
In other words, we didn't get to $200 bitcoin with every early adopter waiting til that valuation to sell, and the same will be true for any valuation in the future.  The whole idea of an "early adopter" is just a category we use to communicate ideas, in reality it's a continuous spectrum of people buying/selling all along the way; there is no magical boundary.

The question being discussed in your link is regarding offering monetary bounties for answered questions.  That has unique problems, like determining the quality of an answer.

That's a silly way to look at it, imo.  People respond to monetary incentives, that's a basic part of the market process.  There is certainly a price at which he would take the time to type out the answer.
Also, tipping on something like reddit wouldn't just be about comments, at least I didn't assume it would be.  You could also tip actual OC, and at that point it's not really any different than paying for all kinds of media content, and if you don't think that decreases quality in the general publishing industry, then I don't necessarily see why it would on reddit.  I think it's the same sort of mistake people make when thinking reddit would be better without a voting system.

Why do you think Garza is there in the first place?  Probably because he thinks it's beneficial to his scam.
I doubt the people actually there are his target audience; the real benefit is being able to associate his company and personal name with the event and the air of legitimacy that goes along with that.  That helps dupe the random naive internet denizens who are his actual target.
So is it better that btc miami has the cash than the scammer?  Well that depends, do you think the scammer gets more value out of it than the cash he paid?  Because clearly Garza thought so or he wouldn't be doing it.  Maybe now that this thing is more publicly blowing up in his face it won't turn out to be true, but my point is you have to consider what he's getting in return for the cash - in this case, publicity at a very "legitimate" sounding bitcoin conference, and I think we all understand that an air of legitimacy is an incredibly valuable asset for a scam - that's what BTC miami is voluntarily providing him in exchange for the cash.  If he's getting more value in return than what he paid, then no, it's not a good thing that BTC miami has the cash.

Yes, but they support states that don't require licensing along with those in which they have obtained the required licensing.  That's where California is in a bit of a gray area, it sounds like they don't explicitly require anything but are saying they might; they haven't decided.  It's hard to make a brief one-size-fits-all statement when states have different requirements.
I think this bit from the article explains it sufficiently:




I'd imagine they're keeping in touch with regulators to make sure they can comply if and when those regulations come about.  Those are probably their two most important states, after all.

Reddit's voting system reminds me more of a direct democracy than a free market.  
@_date: 2016-03-22 20:04:18


Voting was a key component of the success of sites like digg (and later reddit) in the first place.  Progress is a never ending road however, so as yesterday's solutions slowly transition to today's status quo, the flaws start to become more apparent and fixated upon.  It's important to evolve our solutions rather than falling into the trap of only seeing the problems and forgetting about the benefits, which is a recipe for regression.  Crowdsourced content and curation is a powerful tool that's not going away; the focus should be on addressing its current weaknesses (sybil-ish attacks being a pretty big one) rather than throwing out the baby with the bathwater.
I think that WoT vote weighting and maybe the paid upvotes/downvotes are potential evolutions of the voting model; reverting to pure moderator curation is a regression to old models that we would still be using if they were better than our present structures (and to be fair, there is still a place for moderator curated content - that's just the old media model, which continues online today in the form of news sites/blogs and their respective comment sections).
I'm personally interested in the WoT model, particularly in relation to a potential P2P forum app/protocol that routes and prioritizes information in accordance with a WoT.

I think the reality is that the economic majority is not nearly as anti-core (at least not yet) as the populist majority, which is why core still yields significant influence.  Their influence stems from the respect that the economic majority grants them, and you can't claim someone's respect, you have to be given it, and likewise it can be revoked at will.

I think it was already answered pretty clearly, but the answer is that people think it's indirectly related because the story is an example of currency debasement, something that bitcoin is designed to be robust against, at least beyond the agreed upon issuance schedule (for the economically illiterate, that doesn't mean bitcoin can't drop in value as it obviously can, but it does mean that when it does so, it's because of market supply and demand reasons, not because the issuer has started printing more bitcoins).
It's obviously an indirect relation and everyone can draw their own line whats "related enough" to warrant posting here.  If you don't think it is, just say so.  No need to play dumb as if you have no idea why someone posted it after they just explained why they did.

I would say that their arguments are fairly relevant to the use cases where bitcoin is used to facilitate payments from one local currency to another (i.e. remittances).  In that case, these frictions do build up in a reflection of underlying capital controls.  
Of course, most of us probably see fiat-to-fiat payment rails as at best a bootstrapping use case for bitcoin, with the end goal being a mainly (or completely) crpyto-currency using global economy, but it wouldn't be particularly surprising if an author at the federal reserve considered that fantastical and was looking at the more near-term applicable use cases (ones that a fair share of bitcoin companies themselves talk up) like offering payment rails with the end points being denominated and serviced in local currency.
Or maybe it's just pure ill-intent, who knows.  Probably a mix of both.  Reasoning in practice often ends up being an exercise in trying to best logically justify your assumptions and beliefs.  Not that it should be.

Way too general of a statement about capitalism.  Undercutting and being underhanded do not *necessarily* go together (though they can of course).  You can undercut by simply outperforming and being more efficient.  That's "good" capitalism.  You can undercut by doing shady shit as well, but that's where personal liability (rather than the liabilities of an impersonal "entity") would rebalance the cost/benefit analysis of doing so.  
Liability and profit aren't incompatible; they're essential push-pull forces that need to be appropriately balanced for a healthy and productive economy.  I think the idea of limited liability and *entities* being liable (rather than the actual individuals in control) throws that balance out of whack.

I can agree with that - if something is blocked and I'm not sure why, I'm curious to look into it.  As long as we agree that the validity of the blocked material needs to be determined on its own merits, not "just because it was censored, it's probably right".  I brought up the Garza example because I remember Erik speaking up against "censorship" in that case as well.

Does segwit not count as an effective increase?  Because in terms of throughput (which is why we care about the cap), it is a modest but real increase.  The immediate choices appear to be a hardfork to 2MB with bitcoin classic or an effective ~1.5-1.75x throughput increase through segwit.  My opinion is that either is fine and the differences in throughput are fairly minor.
The two "sides" have converged to a great degree (at least regarding the near term), this is mostly just a politically and emotionally charged debate at this point.

The problem is it's not as simple as "if a negative externality exists, ban the root behavior".  The value judgement of an externality is ultimately subjective; most behaviors are going to be a negative externality to someone, and if you went ahead banning all behaviors for that reason there would be no personal liberty left.  It's about balancing personal liberties against externalities.  This isn't a clear divide that can be objectively encapsulated by statements like "Yes, people should have freedoms, but only to the point when they start depriving others of their freedoms".  It's a massive gray area of subjective value judgements.  In extreme cases, it's obvious enough that most people agree - the right to fire your gun does not include the right to fire it at my head for no good reason.  But then there are less clear cases like free speech - in some societies hate speech is disallowed, in some cultures you can't draw pictures of prophets.  Speech has real externalities, it gives people ideas, it makes people uncomfortable, upset, hostile, it can incite violence, it can be abusive.  The reason we (or at least some of us) tolerate free speech is because of the recognition of that *balance* between personal liberties and negative externalities.

I'm not saying it's a perfect situation, what I am saying is that "being held at 1MB" is not even on my top 10 list of reasons why bitcoin might ultimately fail (mainly because it *will* be changed if and when it becomes an obvious problem - we aren't there yet, at least imo).  At worst I see it as a road bump that will be completely forgotten in the grand scheme of bitcoin, success or not.   
I know some people think core has somehow bypassed decentralized consensus mechanisms and enforced 1 MB against everyone's will, but I don't believe that's the case.  I think the economic majority isn't nearly as anti-core as the populist majority (and what determines consensus is ultimately the economic majority), and likewise is not as *urgently* pro-blocksize-increase (still pro general blocksize increase) as the populist majority.  In bitcoin what ultimately matters is the economic majority, not the populist majority (otherwise it would be a democracy), so you're seeing core maintain its position as a result of the economic majority's confidence in them.  If that ever changes and the economic majority truly believes a blocksize increase is necessary *now* and core isn't willing to provide it, then you'll probably see non-core-compatible consensus rules come about.  We aren't there yet, and that's a result of bitcoin's governance structure working properly imo.

Aside from hardforking the PoW, right?  Obviously that's a large disruption and far from ideal (as with any emergency hard fork), but I don't think it'd be hard to come to sufficient consensus to do that in the event of a 51% attack.  Who would be against it other than the current miners, who wouldn't have any particular influence over the resulting fork?
The network gets to decide what PoW it wants - the miners work for the network, not the other way around.  We'll probably stick with SHA256 as long as miners are behaving.  If not, the only thing stopping a change is the will to do it, which I would expect to be in abundance in the case of an actual hashpower attack on the network.
Those mining farms with all their capital investment can instantly be devalued into racks full of expensive paper weights if bitcoin changes its PoW (no other blockchain is going to bother using a PoW algorithm controlled by hostile miners either), so there's actually a lot of incentive for anyone controlling them to *not* attack the network, since they're the ones with the most to lose.
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:40:44
I don't even understand why this comes down to sides - which side am I on?  I think core's roadmap is conservative but not crazily so, and I also think the moderation regarding forks on is over the top.  Things don't have to be so tribal.  
@_date: 2016-01-21 22:50:09
Personally I think the option of exit (via a PoW hardfork of the type luke-jr proposed in the classic PR) is a critical part of bitcoin's governance structure.  There's a lot of talk about how to define "consensus" (which I think hasn't been given a good answer), well I would argue that consensus is defined by the majority's willingness to move on *without* the minority's participation.  Nothing more meritocratic than letting competitors compete.  Investors don't lose much - they have an equal share of either fork at the initial split.  If one eventually dominated due to network effect (which is what I would expect to occur) then you still have your BTC on that chain.  You only risk much if you try to bet on who the winner will be by selling coins from one chain for the other.  Again, another productive market process imo.
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:43:08
IMO the "gravity" of this debate has more to do with egos and people wanting to get their way than it does with the actual seriousness of the consequences.  There are a lot of bright minds in bitcoin, and with that comes some big egos which are bound to clash.  Bitcoin could be stuck for a few more years at 1MB and I don't think it'd be more than a minor inconvenience, it could also probably survive a jump to 4/8MB without becoming irreparably centralized.  The fear mongering from both sides is just rhetorical tactics to try to sway opinion their way.
I'm just glad that what matters in the end is the software that network participants choose to run.  It's not a perfect governing mechanism but it's better than any alternative I can think of.  Just because it doesn't give you the results you want when you want them, doesn't mean it's a failure.  The needs of a functioning consensus protocol mean that plenty of people will not get their way.

Adaptive parameters do open up some attack vectors for gaming, but given that we already have a prominent and functional adaptive parameter (difficulty), I don't think that's reason to exclude potential solutions as possibilities.


In addition, look at examples among altcoins with adaptive blocksizes.  In either case however, it's good to remember that it will be a pretty limited reproduction in terms of the incentives and activity involved with the live bitcoin network.

I agree that the relative magnitude of the affect the "satoshi dumping scenario" has on the price is most likely quite small.  Just making the point that the status of the coins right now is a question mark, and updating that status to a definitive "burned/lost" would shrink the potential supply of bitcoins as well as eliminate the risk of a massive dump of them at some point in the future, which in most analytical approaches would probably be a modest but most definitely positive bump to the EV of betting on bitcoin, which you would further expect to be quickly priced in as soon as the news is known by major market players.

@_date: 2016-03-10 17:54:19


I was trying to say originally that that's one of the fundamental issues.  I don't think you should be able to shield personal liability behind a corporation.  I understand it's been that way for a long time; I'm saying I believe that's a fundamental problem.  Power should be a double edged sword - potential for profit, but also potential for liability.  We go out of our way legally to limit the latter, which I believe to be a mistake.  It's basically another way of privatizing profits while socializing risk.


This "100%" business makes no sense.  What the heck is 100% liability?  What the heck is 100% profit?  Is a chessboard fundamentally incompatible with itself since it contains black and white tiles?  No, it needs both to be a proper chessboard.  A healthy economic incentive structure would be individuals balancing the desire for profit with the liability of acting badly.  I believe I should get all the profits from my actions as well as be completely liable for my actions.  What's incompatible about that?


Like I said earlier, the need to pierce the corporate veil only arises when you put up a corporate veil in the first place.  I'm saying that's compounding mistakes.  Remove the veil and you don't have to come up with special regulations (usually decided on by a regulatory agency captured by the industry it regulates) to pierce it.  I don't think there should be any impersonal "entities" before the law, just individuals.  Your actions should always be fully your own responsibility.

Maintaining that separation requires censorship resistance first and foremost, because if and when bitcoin truly threatens government's monetary authority, it's highly probable they'll do what they can to make it not so.

Take it for what it's worth, but I do use it pretty regularly and the only transaction I've had an issue with recentaly was due to a dust output which is totally unrelated to capacity.
I'm not saying this anecdote means everything will be fine, and surely further congestion would lead to higher fees and general backlog, but I do find it odd that you think everyone using the network is *already* having problems.  Perhaps myself and other bitcoiners I know have just been tremendously lucky.

Obviously not, other than to demonstrate that being the "victim of censorship" has nothing to do with whether or not you're a good or bad guy.  I have a lot of respect for both Gavin and Garzick, zero for Garza.

What really matters in security terms is how expensive it is to attack the network, which is a function of the value of the resources invested in mining, which is driven by the value of the rewards from mining.  In other words, the value of the token primarily drives the security of the network, not the other way around.  Wherever there are valuable tokens to be mined, miners will show up.  That's been plainly obvious if you've been paying attention to the relationships between mining hashrate and blockchain token values over the last several years.  To be absolutely clear - money spent on mining follows the value of the rewards, not the other way around.


I'd imagine they'd have a strong incentive to not end up like the previous miners.  I don't actually expect any of this to happen, since I think the current miners are for the most part smart enough to understand the power dynamics at play.  When push comes to shove, they will do what they think is most profitable, which is to fall in line with what they believe the economic majority of the bitcoin ecosystem wants.  They understand that it's the rest of the ecosystem that gives what they mine most of its value.

What exactly does it indicate about the merits of one side vs the other?  Could you clarify what you meant by that?  The only thing it could possibly indicate is the character of the moderator, who by the way does not speak for an entire "side".  I'm openly critical of moderation policy yet I don't understand why that should affect my opinion regarding blocksize; it's completely irrelevant to the technical arguments.  It only colors my feelings towards theymos' moderating ability.
I'm trying to seperate the discussions over blocksize and moderation policy, since I don't think it's intellectually justifiable to conflate the two.  Obviously it's human nature to form sides and conflate a bunch of  issues along party lines (which is why theymos is often hurting his own cause imo), but I don't think it's right or helpful.

No ones going to want to put money into a coin being mined by the same people/tech that just boned bitcoin.

The first time I read about it (some hackernews post in 2010ish) I followed a link to the whitepaper and read that (seemed pointless to try to speculate about it without actually understanding how it worked). At that time I was already convinced of the need/merits of a non-state controlled, fixed supply monetary system, and I was aware that the main obstacles in creating such a system were the central points of failure that were susceptible to government controls.  Reading the whitepaper, it was clear that this was quite a clever technical contraption written by a very competent and clear-thinking individual, and it hit many of the marks I thought were needed for a successful, independent monetary system.  I thought it remained to be seen if it really *did* work (the threat of a 50% attack mucking things up seemed much larger at the time with the modest hashrates, and I also suspected it would likely be declared illegal if it saw meaningful success which would challenge adoption rates), but the idea that it was some sort of scam didn't seem probable.  Scams aren't usually backed up by potentially revolutionary technical docs.
I remember telling my roommate at the time that this *could* work, and if it does it will (eventually) be worth over 7 figures per BTC (inflation adjusted).

Agreed that miner consensus is far from the only consensus that matters (it just happens to be the easiest to quantify, which is why I used it as an example).  
It's worth noting that the post here isn't demanding that a hard fork happens, it's asking if the signatories of the hong kong agreement intend to honor their agreement to code up a 2MB hard fork implementation and recommend it to core.  I think both sides understand this isn't a guarantee it's accepted, and I think it's perfectly fair to expect that agreement to be kept.
@_date: 2019-03-09 02:51:03
I'm not exactly a nano expert, but isn't it basically "global broadcast for all transactions" like pretty much everything else?  That means at scale you will need "meganodes" to keep up with transaction processing, which will inevitably lead to node centralization (the lack of incentives to run your own node compounds this problem).  
Whether you think that's an acceptable trade off or not is another question, but that's the fundamental difference between how lightning scales and how most cryptocurrencies scale.  Lightning moves away from the global broadcast architecture and reduces transaction processing to those nodes routing the payment, rather than requiring every node on the network to process every payment.  This allows the scaling burden on full nodes to be far more manageable than any global broadcast format, with the idea that this will help preserve node decentralization and maintain the "peer to peer"-ness of the actual network topology (a few meganodes serving millions of clients is a client/server network, not really peer-to-peer).

I'm inclined to agree; I can't see how this BIP makes any real difference in whether or not a business decides to participate in KYC/AML.  Those that are required to do so already do (unless they're willing to accept the risks in not doing so), and those that aren't required to do so aren't looking to scare off potential sales by requiring more information than is needed.  I don't think there's anyone out there saying "I would require KYC/AML info but I can't because coding a form is too hard".
The only thing this BIP really changes in that equation is whether or not there's a separate field/form you have to fill out for KYC/AML info or if you can more or less elect to auto-populate that information based on the BIP standards.  That being said, I'm not really interested in making KYC/AML processes more efficient, so I can relate to some of the opposition to the BIP, but not at all to the "this BIP is literally Hitler" over-reaction.  The devs were just trying to make things more efficient, for better or worse.  I would prefer a payment protocol that's scaled back to support only those things that are pretty universally useful to the average merchant (shipping addresses, refund addresses, etc.); not those with KYC/AML burdens (these are generally money transmitters anyway, not merchants).

The timeline for a hard fork being coded up by the signatories and presented to core is July *2016*.  That's the part he's asking about.
I'm fine with core's scaling plan; you can check my long post history here if you don't believe me.  I just also think it's perfectly fair to expect people to honor their word, and anyone who's willing to overlook basic expectations of good character in order to support their "side" is guilty of tribalism imo.  Don't be that guy.
@_date: 2016-06-27 18:38:27
Good thing they aren't, at least not in this post.
All he's asking is if the people who signed intend to follow through on their agreement to propose hardfork code by the agreed upon time frame.  Do you think he has no basis to expect you and others to keep their agreements?

You think the nodes of the exchanges, merchants, active users etc. don't have economic value?  I think it's pretty obvious they hold the vast majority of the economic value.  If you fork away from them you'll have no economic activity on your chain other than miners.  Deploying a bunch of nodes makes no difference here; they're just forwarding blocks that the other fork considers invalid and thus contributing basically nothing. 
Again, if the exchanges, users, merchants, etc. don't fork *with* the miners, then the miners have no one to sell to, trade with, or purchase from, and adding a bunch of nodes does nothing to change that.

Well, yeah.  If for some reason bitcoin wallet software and UI progress stops in its tracks then we'd be pretty screwed, but I don't see any reason why it would.  The market tends to select for superior quality offerings so I'm not at all worried about that happening.

It wasn't obvious from the title, but it's pretty clear from the actual article that he's specifically talking to those involved with core *that signed the agreement*, not core devs in general:


  And the agreement wasn't to merge and deploy a hard fork, but just to code one up for proposal.  This doesn't require anything from non-signing core members or any consensus from the ecosystem, thus democratic legitimacy or objections from those not involved are pretty irrelevant.
The agreement only specifies actions that are within the control of those signing; it's not asking non-signing parties (such as yourself) to do anything.

On a related note, the "article" Craig emailed to O'Hagan and others that claimed UK law enforcement may arrest Craig on anti-terror related charges was actually [a hoax site]( (see the editor's note as the fake article is long gone).  It seems O'Hagan still may not realize this as he mentions in his recent expose that Craig sent him that article but made no mention that it turned out to be fake.  According to O'Hagan's article, Craig (and Ramona) made a pretty big deal about this threat of arrest and used it to justify his reluctance to produce public proof.  It seems rather likely to me that he was the one who created the fake site in the first place to give himself a better excuse to resist providing public proof - an excuse other than him being simply unable to.
@_date: 2016-06-29 15:17:46


For one, no he doesn't, and two, BIP 75 (to my understanding, someone can correct me if I'm wrong) doesn't have any impact on the actual transaction that is broadcast to the network (it's just an information exchange completely outside of the bitcoin protocol), and filtering/blocking those transactions in the way you're describing isn't even possible.  He's using "boycott" in the traditional sense (people electing to not use it), not some sort of protocol level blacklisting/filtering of wallets.

I think revenue from natural resource rights is a fair source for funding a form of UBI, since *raw natural resources* are not created by the productive efforts of man.  You can look at it as a more formalized and modern version of "the right to live off the land"; recognizing that there's a certain amount of wealth nature provides all on its own and that "I claimed it first so I own rights forever" may not be the most reasonable or just way to allocate that wealth in perpetuity.
I'm definitely for 100% self ownership of your productive capacity (boo income tax), but no one made the raw earth and its natural resources so they don't fall under that category imo.  Our current systems of natural resource ownership are quickly trending towards a state where people will be born into a world that provides them absolutely *nothing* for free - no land to forage, no game to hunt, no spring from which to drink - effectively no right to "live off the land", meaning you have to serve those who came before you in order to have any hope to survive.  I don't find that very "libertarian".  I think everyone should have the right to "live off the land", and the most reasonable way to quantify and administrate that right in the modern world would be to share the revenue from natural resource rights, which imo should be auctioned off on a temporal basis (10 year rights, 100 year rights, etc.) with the revenue funding a form of UBI.

Just so everyone's clear, the agreement wasn't that "core will merge a hard fork", but that:


I don't really see any reason why that wouldn't be honored, other than the involved contributors changing their mind and no longer wanting to.  If that's the case, I think it's perfectly fair to expect them to acknowledge that's the case.  If they still intend to follow through, then great, they can say that too.  Nothing wrong with asking for clarification of their position, considering we're approaching the time frame for a hard fork proposal laid out in the agreement.

I agree that limiting resource jurisdiction to national borders would be a suboptimal format (not suggesting we do that either, if that wasn't clear).  I feel that way about most things relating to political borders.

@_date: 2016-06-27 17:20:58
As far as I'm concerned, this isn't about panicing over the limit, it's asking if those [who signed this agreement]( still intend to honor it.  I personally think people should honor their word and that it's perfectly fair to expect them to, and opinions on blocksize don't even enter into that consideration.  That's just basic character and integrity.
If they changed their mind, they should at least say so.  If they didn't and are working on following through, they can say so too.  That's all I see being brought up here.
@_date: 2016-06-29 20:12:47
The software should at least give you a fair estimate for the fee.  If it does that, the congestion would be dealt with by users *choosing* to not send a transaction because this or that transaction isn't worth the fee, rather than people wondering why their transaction isn't confirming.  I'm not saying the former user experience is perfect, but it certainly beats the latter.
This isn't at all to say that the block size limit shouldn't be raised, what I'm saying is that we should at least deal with the limit properly (and that's to have wallet software that properly suggests realistic fees to the user -  a way to RBF in the case that the estimate was off would be even better).  This "use some old hard-coded fee that will never confirm" method is the worst way to deal with it, and results in the worst possible user experience.  Wallets that still do that really need to be discarded (and they will).
We'll know the "fee market" has matured when the complaints are only about how expensive fees are rather than confusion over why things aren't confirming.

They need the rest of the ecosystem too.  If they "upgrade" without everyone else they end up mining nearly worthless coins that they can't sell or trade with anyone but themselves.
The bottom line is, no one group "decides" anything in bitcoin, the actual power is pretty well distributed between the various segments of the network (exchanges, miners, developers, users, merchants, etc.).

They aren't really contradictory unless you assume that pro-BU = anti-segwit, which some people involved with BU may be but Gavin appears to be referencing BU's approach to blocksize specifically, which isn't necessarily at odds with segwit.  
I feel like the only reason this may appear contradictory is that people are so baked into their team mentality (true of many on both sides obviously) that they force everything into an "us vs them" divide even when there's no technical reason for two concepts to be directly at odds.  Even this comment will probably be viewed as "adversarial" by some on both sides because I don't go out of my way to specify their team as good and the other as bad.

If that's your dream, I'm sorry but it was never going to be a reality (and never has been - an absence of political controversy does not imply the absence of politics, only the absence of controversy).  Money is a social construct; social constructs are inherently political.  Bitcoin does not circumvent this simple fact; how could it possibly accomplish that?  It's a system created, maintained, and operated by people.  If people are involved, there will be politics.
Not all political systems are created equal however.  The only question is whether the "governance" of bitcoin (I'd describe it as something like an agoristic meritocracy) can support a better monetary system than our current monetary paradigm (a hodgepodge of technocracy/aristocracy/representative democracy, all administered with a healthy dose of coercion).  Personally, I think it can, and if it does I consider that a resounding success.
With bitcoin, you have the option to simply ignore the politics if you'd like - no one here can force you to do anything.  You can write whatever code you'd like, run whatever client you'd like, and bitcoin "governance" can't force you to do otherwise.  Of course, that means you can't force anyone else to do as you'd like either, as those are two sides of the same coin.  That's about as "apolitical" as it can possibly get - the individual is free from political coercion, but politics will still play a role in the fate of the overall system.

If you're talking about any and all possible adaptive block size proposals, then that seems like an absurdly reductionist and dogmatic viewpoint.
If you have problems with specific proposals I could understand, but saying the game is impossible to be arranged productively does not follow.  Difficulty is already an adaptive parameter in bitcoin that appears to be sufficiently game-resistant, not to mention the basic mechanism of nakamoto consensus relies on the game theory being productive.  If you have such a negative outlook on the potential of productive mechanism design then you should be avoiding bitcoin already, as it heavily relies on it in its current form.

Depends on how you're measuring "bigger".  The downside to "big" batteries was primarily physically - both volume and weight.  By that metric, I don't believe they've gotten "bigger" (correct me if I'm wrong, by that's my relatively strong anecdotal observation).  
Efficiency improvements in battery technology have however increased their capacity in terms of mAh, normalized to volume/weight metrics.  Is that more analogous to an increased blocksize, or a more efficient use of blocksize?  There's valid arguments to be made *both ways*, which I emphasize to those on either side of this argument.  Don't filter valid arguments based on whether or not it fits your preferred narrative; recognize them all if you truly value advancing your understanding of this world over protecting your ego.

I mean, without segwit2x it was looking like we were going to have a pretty chaotic UASF.  Now that they backed off the 2x, it turns out all the agreement accomplished was activating segwit smoothly (precisely what the crowd was skeptical about in the original agreement).
If you were to devise a conspiratorial long con to get Jihan on board with segwit, it would look like this lol.  I'm not saying that's what it was (I'm quite certain it wasn't), but I'm just saying, it worked out alright, didn't it?  Even if this whole B2X stuff was a bit messy, I doubt UASF would have been any smoother, and that's where we were heading without segwit2x.

Do you think the only way to successfully speculate is to be lucky?  I speculated on bitcoin based on my understanding of the tech and monetary theory/history.  I did it because, by my estimation, it was an extremely favorable bet.  Luckily, I wasn't deterred by the fact that the trader on the other end of my buy was possibly better informed and/or funded or whatever.
I mean, you're probably in the same boat, aren't you?  I think I've seen your username around for a while.  Maybe you differentiate between long term speculation (buy and hold) vs short term (trading)?  It's all speculation still.
Speculating on price can be extremely profitable (which is useful in my book), but it's obviously not an exact science.  Doesn't mean you can't potentially find an opportunity worth taking.

Gold supply also inflates at around 1.5% per year due to mining (and can vary based on mine yields and discoveries).  Bitcoin is higher for now, but the fact that it drops pretty quickly to zero is a big advantage.  The difference between 1.5% a year and 0% in terms of a store of value is huge.

Gemini or GDAX (the exchange run by Coinbase) should be fine for you


The Coinbase site fees are high, but the same account can be used at GDAX and fees on GDAX are competitive.  Make sure you know the very basics of an exchange interface before you go mucking around in GDAX or gemini.


Long term most will recommend a hardware wallet.  Make sure you understand the security profile if you go that route.  Trezor is popular, so is ledger nano.  


No one knows.  It could keep running up, it could crash at any moment (for what it's worth, I'm fairly bullish right now, but obviously you're going to find bullish people here).  The pure EV play (expected value) is to put it all in ASAP, but if you want some insurance against a potential crash at any moment then you might put some portion of it in and then gradually invest the rest over some given period.

@_date: 2017-11-05 23:27:27


While I'm inclined to think the same way, I do feel like the widespread "expectation" of a crash gets stronger after every bubble bitcoin goes through, and I wonder how that might affect the dynamics of the subsequent bubbles.  
Most of the "veterans" in the BTC market (which include most of the BTC whales) are fully expecting a major retrace at some point; at least that's the sense I get.  The major market makers (as well as smaller traders in aggregate) have a lot of influence in how all this plays out, and if they're highly concerned about a bubble popping and their trading reflects it, they could act like a dampening function on the rest of the market's exuberance and help smooth out the ups and downs of the bubble.  In an ideal world, that's actually their job.  
One might say, "does this look like damped exuberance to you??", and yeah, I get that, but if we do a [comparison to 2013]( then it's apparent that we haven't had as violent of a spike as we had back then.  The rise has been, believe it or not, comparatively mild this time around.  You could just call that a "more mature market", but a more mature market includes more mature market makers and traders, alongside simple measurables like higher volume.  
Not saying that's what's happening or anything, but it's interesting to consider all these feedback effects of market psychology.  While I'm still in the "major crash at any moment wouldn't surprise me" boat, I'm also thinking it's possible we might get away with no more than a 20% or so crash before leveling off for a while.  Which is still "big" of course, but small in bitcoin bubble terms.  We'll see.

I say it as a percentage because the relative growth rate is what matters.  Saying there's "~2,000 tons of new gold mined a year" is not very useful in this context unless the reader also knows the total supply, but I can save people some research and arithmetic by just saying the percentage.  The percentage is indeed what matters for the context that I'm talking about.  I also explicitly said the percentage will vary based on mine yields and discoveries so there was no implication that it would be some fixed portion of the total supply.

No better way to get data on all this stuff than real competition though, so I'm happy to see options.

A fork of the client, not the chain.  The point I'm making applies only to chain forks - the chain is the ledger.  Litecoin did not fork off the bitcoin blockchain.

Crossed out litecoin as it's not a fork of bitcoin (at least not the chain, which is what I'm talking about).  
Bitcoin gold - this just straight up has less interest and support than bitcoin cash, by every metric I can figure, so yeah I'd say bitcoin cash has the edge over it
Future bitcoin fork - Who knows, I'm not saying it will have an advantage over future bitcoin forks.
I'm just pointing out one advantage forking has over starting from scratch.  It makes it much easier imo to onboard the bitcoin community (since they essentially start out with a stake in it), which like it or not is still the biggest market in crypto.  It's far from an end all be all analysis obviously, as there are plenty of other factors as well.

The key in my statement was "that was anywhere near as close to first draft bitcoin as Nick's bitgold proposal".  I'm aware of most of those projects (certainly hashcash), and my evaluation was that bitgold was by far the closest direct precursor to bitcoin in actual architecture (I mean the actual specifics of how the pieces are put together).  It's clearly a lot closer to bitcoin than hashcash is, for example, and I have yet to see a proposal that fills the "gap" between bitcoin and what was around before it better than bitgold.  I'm guessing I'm probably not gonna find anything closer at this point unless there's some obscure paper out there no one's seen; I've spent a ton of time researching this topic already.  
That's my evaluation, at least.

There may be a general trend towards increasing stability as market cap grows, but we're still talking about an asset that's up like 1000% on the year; anytime you have a run up like that the potential for a "crash" correction is gonna be there (might not be quite 70% or whatever, but even a 30-40% crash can be a disaster if someone's over extended and the market doesn't recover quickly).  As always, hard to say when or where exactly it's coming though, and just because there will probably be a crash at some point, that doesn't necessarily mean the present price is a bad entry point.

It might not be Szabo, that much I agree with (I just think he's the most likely of the known candidates).  I have to push back a bit here though:


The idea of "decentralized e-cash" may have been "common" (dunno if that's really the right word for it but I know what you mean), but was there any proposal that was anywhere near as close to first draft bitcoin as Nick's bitgold proposal [here](  I've read about B-money and some of the other proposals that have been kicked around over the past, but bitgold clearly jumped out to me as a potential direct precursor to bitcoin.

Yeah, it doesn't make sense to me that you *wouldn't* be able to do a bcash style fork with monero (one that preserves holdings on both chains).  I don't know enough about monero to be 100% positive either so I was hoping someone could clarify haha.

I'm specifically curious why he thinks a minority fork of Monero wouldn't be an "air drop" situation like bcash.  I'm not a Monero expert or anything but as far as I know it should work the same way in that regard.

What they actually said is they'd go with the chain with more miner support.  They referred to this as "letting the market decide" but I can't say I agree with the methodology.  I thought we'd moved beyond this idea that miners are "representative" of the market in this sense.

I'm totally fine with core being the "conservative/secure" option (that's what I've been supporting all along, and it's what they're good at), but I'm not 100% sure that the market will ultimately prefer that balance and it only makes sense to invest accordingly.

First of all, the [thread you're quoting from]( *wasn't about blocksize*, so if the point you wanted to make was that we should increase the blocksize, you didn't do a very good job of arguing that because you made precisely zero mention of it.
So disregarding block size issues - what is your preference instead of a fee market?  Block size, even without a hard limit, will always be limited by some sort of practical consideration, and a market is how you efficiently allocate a scarce resource - in this case, space in a block.  I have no idea what system you think would work better than a fee market - trying to artificially fix prices too low is how you get shortages that you can't do anything about other than wait in line, which doesn't sound like a situation you'd consider satisfactory.  At least with a market, you have the option to pay more if your transaction is urgent.  If your complaint is that you can't get a transaction through fast enough, artificially forcing a lower transaction fee is going to make that problem worse.  So seriously, how do you propose to regulate fees that would actually address the problem?  If you think "just make the fees cheap, markets be damned" is a viable solution, then you'd probably make an excellent candidate for economic advisor to Venezuela.
And if you think I'm just a "troll" popping up with a recent narrative, [here's]( some of my [comments]( from over [a year ago](  Some excerpts:






Lighting network would be a rather ideal version of what I'm describing in that last excerpt, since it would remain relatively decentralized and trustless - assuming it can live up to its promise of course, which remains to be seen.
I could find plenty more comments from earlier than that if reddit would actually let me search my own friggin comments (reddit pls).  I've had more or less this general view of bitcoin pretty much since I first learned how it works many years ago, not because that's what I want it to be, but because as best I could tell, that's what it simply is.

Anyone promoting it as a maximizing strategy is an idiot, agreed.  But whenever I see someone recommending it, it's usually for the right reason - reduce risk due to timing and take the whole "timing" element out of the discussion.  I rarely see anyone arguing it's the best EV strat.
A lot of people find risk reduction pretty valuable in itself, even if it comes at a slight hit to EV, so personally I think it's a good recommendation for the average joe.

You're not strictly using bitcoin if you're trying to pay them with fiat.  It's no different than any other fiat purchase (worse actually, since it's a fiat MSB); you're just getting bitcoin in return instead of some good or service.

Do you think the fact that Satoshi had email correspondences with Finney, Wei Dai, and Adam Back was Finney pro-actively trying to deflect suspicion towards Szabo?  Because Szabo's omission from that group is really curious considering "bitgold" was imo clearly the closest contemporary to bitcoin - I'm almost certain that whoever made bitcoin was at least reading Szabo's blogs on bitgold.  If it was Finney, I don't know why he wouldn't contact Szabo about it (pseudonymously as Satoshi ofc), other than as a long term plan to deflect suspicion towards Szabo, which doesn't really seem like something Finney would do.
If Finney was directly involved, I think it's more likely he was working with Szabo and Szabo was "Satoshi".  Personally I don't think Finney was directly involved.  That's just the impression I got after reading [this article]( a while back.

I think it's only fair to point out that this proposal also is what got segwit deployed with minimal disruption (a UASF would have certainly been pretty disruptive even if it was ultimately successful).  A lot of people on the "big block" side were suspicious that it would just be used to get segwit activated, then the 2x part of it would be backed out of.  That ended up being the case, intentional or not.
Without segwit2x, we probably would have had a disruptive event with UASF, so you have to take that into account when evaluating its net effect on the ecosystem.  I'm personally happy it was abandoned but I'm also happy that it enabled smooth activation of segwit.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:13:44

@_date: 2017-11-09 02:01:10
I'm confused what that has to do with my point, which was this:


Do you disagree or something?  I thought it was just a simple fact.  There were two parts to segwit2x - segwit activation then 2x, and only the first part actually happened.  That's just reality, isn't it?  I'm not saying that was the intention (I'm quite sure it wasn't), if that's what you're thinking.
Basically I'm just reminding everyone that the counterfactual to segwit~~2x~~ was looking like UASF.  Either way it was probably going to be messy, wasn't it?  I feel like this was probably the smoothest *realistic* outcome actually.  I don't see how a UASF would have been any smoother than a cancelled 2x.
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:39:28
Incentives are ultimately what matter, which is why imo you should be concerned when there are potential misalignments of incentives that could lead to a tragedy of the commons dynamic.  
If I'm a small miner/pool (say less than 1% of the network), it might be that I would make more money by accepting transactions strictly based on fees (rather than first seen) since the affects of my actions on network confidence would be pretty small, and me alone implementing it wouldn't make double-spends that much more practical than they already are, since I rarely find a block.  Of course, once one little guy is doing it (and profiting from it), then the others slightly bigger might do it as well to compete, and then you quickly end up in a situation where either everyone is doing it or the rules have to be re-worked to disincentivize that behavior.
Ideally you would have short term, individual incentives aligned with long term collective incentives.  The current first seen policy presents some misalignments on that front.  Whether or not it ultimately becomes a significant problem will depend on the subtleties of the situation, and ones that imo are difficult to impossible to model and predict with any confidence.  If you want to play it safe, focusing on aligning incentives is the way to go.
Your argument that miners are incentivized to protect the health and the value of the network is a good one in regards to things like a 51% attack, since the attacker(s) in that case also represent a majority stakeholder in a big part of the network infrastructure, and their actions would have significant consequences to the network.  It's a significantly weaker argument when the "offending" miner can be arbitrarily small, as in the case of RBF.  Then they can profit with minimal harm to the overall network due to their small presence, but then that behavior will start flowing uphill in order for others to remain competitive, and in the end everyone loses - i.e., tragedy of the commons.

Ha, yeah I actually caught that when I was listening also, thought it was rather amusing.  It's an easy enough verbal slip up though so I didn't want to read much into it, but yeah, certainly raised an eyebrow haha.
And just to be clear, I totally agree we don't have any direct evidence that it's Szabo.  There's always a chance it could be someone no one is talking about (if it is, however, I'd be really surprised if he/she/they were not directly influenced by bitgold).  I just think out of the *candidates we know of*, I'd have to put my money on Szabo, but I'm definitely not ruling out other "unknown" candidates.

At least it got segwit activated without any chain splits (aside from Bcash I guess, but it still kept most of the community on the same chain).  Without segwit2x, we would have probably had a UASF which would have been a big disruption in itself.

That's irrelevant to the argument being made (the fact that you're concerned with who's making the argument is rather telling of your approach to this).  If he wanted to talk about increasing block size, he should have mentioned it, for starters.  OP was arguing *against the dynamics of a fee market*.  That should be obvious if you read the arguments being made rather than letting who's making them influence which "side" you take.  


We just established that a well-functioning fee market is valuable regardless of the block size.  Particularly against a DDoS attack that isn't a result of "natural" transaction volume.  OP is arguing against fee markets, period.  See his [other comments]( in this thread theorizing how to determine fees based on "what's reasonable" rather than simply using a market.
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:39:19
Basically, and my understanding is that F2Pool already supports this.  The only obstacle I suppose it getting your new transaction propagated to them if most of the nodes don't yet support FSSRBF.  Maybe they could just open up a direct channel people could use to transmit updated tx's to them.
This would be a rather short lived business idea, since sooner or later all wallets should support responsive fees and FSSRBF is pretty uncontroversial and should see wider acceptance.  These "stress tests" show the need for these features and should accelerate their development/incorporation.

That proposal is exactly the type to which my critique applies to.  It only makes sense if you neglect the role the monetary store of value plays in determining "risk free" real interest rates, and the importance that rate plays in facilitating the efficient allocation of resources across time.
Between price stability and market determination of interest rates, you can only pick one.  It's basically a question of whether or not you think it makes sense to subject money itself to what is essentially price controls empowered by manipulation of the market's ability to determine real interest rates, i.e. the time value of money.  I think it's a bad idea for the same reason price controls in general are a bad idea.
And incidentally, any money supply that is not explicitly fixed interferes with the market's ability to signal real interest rates as well.  IMO, bitcoin's monetary policy is already designed to asymptotically approach an ideal state.  I think "price stability" of the base monetary unit is a misguided goal that doesn't actually optimize resource allocation across the time domain due to the manipulation of the time value of money required to make price stability happen.

I believe holders give it most of its value.  I think this is basically true of all currencies (including the Dollar) but the modern monetary system can be confusing because the real money is sovereign debt, not the currency.  The US Dollar is strong because US debt is considered a strong store of value, and Dollars are the most liquidly convertible currency for US debt (there's also the bit about possibly getting bombed if you don't sell oil for Dollars, but both of these things can be true to various extents).  When foreign CBs or other large entities hold "Dollars" in reserve, that's referring to interest paying US debt (notes, treasuries, bonds), not inflationary cash.  Without the "store of value" aspect of US debt "backing" it, the Dollar would not have it's dominant role.

That's why I'm agreeing they're all just different words for holding an asset; the main differentiator for why people might choose one word over another is the risk/volatility of the position.  "Speculative" usually applies to high risk/high volatility positions, "saving" usually refers to low risk/low volatility.  
But yes, you're right, it's all just holding an asset so at the end of the day, call it whatcha wanna call it.  I don't personally think it's important what term people want to use.

In the not-so-distant future I assume ordinary users would be using wallets that both estimate necessary fees (as a function of desired confirmation time) and have the ability to replace with a higher fee if your transaction is stuck.  So it will still be a question of how much they're willing to pay to get a transaction through; it won't be a case where you'd be strictly locked out.  The more responsive the market becomes to fees, the more expensive an effective "DDoS" attack would become.  It's relatively "cheap" now because most wallets aren't responsive at all and things like FSSRBF aren't that common.

If you're not opposed to a functioning fee market, then you'd probably find little to agree with the OP if you read the thread he's quoting from - no one was talking about block size, it was about the consequences of a transaction DDoS attack and how a well functioning fee market could help mitigate the effectiveness of such an attack. 
And I agree, we already have a fee market (albeit a very clunky one due to a lack of effective tools), and expecting it to work any other way is just ignorance. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:18:50

The thread he's quoting from has nothing to do with block size, it's about fee markets, and I have no idea why anyone would oppose fee markets regardless of what the block size is. I'm not even opposed to increasing the block size and I'm quoted as an "example" simply because I explained how fee markets would work. I doubt I'm the only "troll" being quoted that is ok with increasing block size (personally I'd prefer a bit more conservative increase schedule than what Gavin proposed), since that has little to do with whether or not you think a fee market is a good idea. 
Do you have a better solution than a fee market?  I sure hope it's not price fixing, because I hope the problems with that would be obvious enough that I don't need to explain them.

@_date: 2015-07-07 16:35:39
You should really separate the topic of block size increases from fee markets.
There's no good argument against fee markets regardless of how you feel about block size.  Price fixing transaction fees lower than what demand dictates is not a workable solution.
If you want to talk about increasing block size, just do that.  Trying to spin fee markets as a bad thing is a sign that you haven't really thought things through very well.  No matter the block size limit (or no limit at all), there will be practical limitations on block size, and there's no reason to not use a market to try to best allocate space in a block.  Using a market to price find is literally one of the most basic concepts of economics, and the more tools we give users to adequately respond to market conditions (the market is already there - miners select for high fee/kb), the better.

The best that can be done is to remind people (including, as you said, the core devs and other smart folks at times) that ad hominem and personality attacks don't contribute anything to their argument, and if anything detract from it in the eyes of those attempting to form an objective and informed opinion.

No reason not to have both. Estimated fees should be fine most of the time, but estimates are just estimates. If a bunch of high fee transactions get sent right after yours you could get delayed, or your urgency could change (sent with low fee/urgency, then you realize for whatever reason that you do need it confirmed ASAP). 
They're both important tools in a user-friendly fee market.

What are you expecting?  Bitcoin has tons of improvements that need to be made throughout the ecosystem.  If you're bullish on bitcoin, I sure hope it's because you're expecting those improvements to be made.  If we froze the ecosystem in the state it is in now, it's a guaranteed failure.  We need to continuously work towards that "perfect world", not deride it as an unacceptable solution since it's not here now.  
IMO, one of the fundamental advantages of bitcoin is the open source culture of permissionless inovation, applied to a financial protocol.  Open source projects are the best realizations of a true meritocracy - may the best solution win.

Well generally speaking, I definitely agree that you shouldn't invest in what you don't understand, and bitcoin is hard to understand for a lot of people.  Most people legitimately *can't* tell the difference between bitcoin and a million other scam investments being pushed right now (they lack the time and/or ability to fully research and understand the situation), so it's perfectly reasonable for them to stay away.  It'll cost them money in the long run, sure, but that's just the way it needs to be.  People throwing money at things they don't understand is *not* a good thing for the economy in general.

I'm just saying the hard part of that is the fiat interface.  Most alts don't even have to deal with that since they exchange for bitcoin, not fiat, but that's only a viable model so long as bitcoin is the main fiat on-ramp.  Once you have to start directly exchanging an alt for fiat then you'll run into much of the same problems that bitcoin-fiat exchanging faces, since the only anonymous fiat transaction is cash, in person.

How do you propose we accomplish this without basically having the system we have now where a central authority can influence the velocity of money by tweaking interest rates on the monetary store of value (in the current system, sovereign debt)?  Because this current system is far from ideal as its success basically relies on a committee of people knowing "better" than the market, which is a rather dubious bet, particularly over the long term.
In order to gain price stability in this manner, you lose proper transmission of the time value of money (real interest rates), leading to the potential exacerbation of long term boom-bust cycles.  The time value of money is probably *the most* important price in the economy.  Subject it to price controls at your own peril.

I can't speak for others, but as someone who's been arguing for years that decentralized solutions are not inherently "cheap", I noted at least part of that exception [here](


You can certainly add the potential to break monopolistic anti-competitive strongholds to that list, although that doesn't really change the fact that a centralized solution that's not just a rent-seeking monopolistic apparatus would have potential overhead advantages compared to a decentralized alternative, regulatory interactions aside.
The thing about the "regulation-circumventing" argument is it relies on bitcoin maintaining "adequate" decentralization, which is a very tricky thing to define, and since "maintaining adequate decentralization" is the main crux of the argument for being conservative with block size increases, it's not clear which position in that debate the "cheap transactions resulting from regulatory resistance" point would support.  The main question is what, if any, impact block size increases would have on increased centralization and the ability for regulatory frameworks to exude pressure on bitcoin protocol activity.  That's a very difficult question to answer, and I don't propose to know the answer to that, and I'm highly skeptical of anyone who thinks the answer is obvious, whether they're pro or con block size increases.
And just to be clear, I'm for a block size increase of some sort, but would prefer something a bit more conservative than Gavin's doubling every two years until 8GB proposal.  My main concern however is honest arguments, since that's the process by which I try to come to my own conclusions.
*edit* - I want to add that another way to keep transaction costs lower in practice is essentially what we have now - block rewards subsidized by monetary inflation rather than only transaction costs.  Suggesting this would certainly cause an epic shitstorm, but I personally wouldn't necessarily be opposed to (hypothetically speaking in a future where it appears like it might be beneficial) freezing the inflation rate at some very small value before it reaches zero - I don't know the right number, but something like .1% or less just off the top of my head, with the idea being that both savers and spenders should share the cost of maintaining the network - savers through some very modest monetary inflation rate, and spenders through transaction fees.  Since they both derive utility from the network functioning, it seems reasonable to share the costs.  Not much point in discussing this now though, it'd be a decision to start considering a few decades from now, since if everything appears to be working fine and transaction fees appear more than sustainable for incentivizing network security (hashrate) at that point, there's no reason to make a change.

I'm not sure how delayed confirmations would impact zero confirmation transactions in any way.  They by definition do not rely on confirmations, which is what a DDoS of this manner would potentially delay.  Feasibility and security of 0-confirm is its own topic unrelated to this one.
And quit being such a drama queen.  If you seriously thought bitcoin would face no obstacles or challenges as it tries to scale and withstand various threats/attacks, then yeah, you signed up for the wrong thing.  Good thing no one is making you stick around.
@_date: 2015-07-08 03:07:44
Are you suggesting "too high" of a fee would be the fault of a fee market?  Because trying to set the price below what the market would set it at basically means you have guaranteed delays - ones that you can't get around by paying a higher fee.  It's the same concept as how artificially low price controls leads to queues/rationing.
If a fee market results in fees that you consider "too high", the only viable solution would be to increase capacity.  Getting rid of the fee market solves nothing, unless you think unavoidable delays is an acceptable compromise to lower fees.
Price finding is a very straightforward theoretical concept - it's just the organic result of matching up supply with demand.  If you don't like the resulting price, you need to alter the underlying supply/demand dynamic, not just try to fix the price.  
If you're worried that a fee market would result in unacceptably high fees, stick to arguing for an increased block size.  Arguing against the merits of a fee market is an unproductive approach.

Bitcoin cash's biggest strength compared to alts is that it forked off of bitcoin.  
One of the things that made investing in bitcoin attractive for me was the idea that any technical change could be made via a fork, by anyone, and you'd automatically have a stake in the resulting chain. What I was buying into was a monetary ledger, not the exact technical specs of the network, and that ledger is what will fundamentally persist through whatever protocol updates and/or forks happen along the way.  Forks preserve that ledger, altcoins start from scratch.  Anyone that had a stake on the bitcoin ledger has incentives to prefer the "altcoin" that branched off of the bitcoin ledger, since it preserved their stake.  And bitcoin holders are the largest community in crypto, obv.

Is "a high end home internet connection" the right standard?  Just because some people can still run a node, does that mean it won't contribute to further decline in the number of nodes?  Is that an acceptable part of maintaining an adequately decentralized bitcoin network?  Analyzing one small part of it doesn't say much about the overall topic.  You could repeat the same analysis with the assumption that "adequate decentralization means being able to run a node on my potato with satellite internet" and come to a conclusion that only 500kb blocks are acceptable.  It wouldn't be particularly informative, since the real issue is baked into the assumption.
My feeling is that Gavin's plan would probably be fine, but I'm under no impression that that comes from a place of technical certainty.  This is very much an ongoing experiment still, and we're learning as we go.

It wouldn't be miners giving up power, it would just be users exercising theirs.  
The power dynamic between miners and the network is widely misunderstood.  The network hires the miners by offering incentives (block rewards) in exchange for a service (building PoW blocks according to the rules of the network).  The miners are not "in charge" any more than the security guard is in charge of the bank.  
The misunderstanding is fueled by the fact that previous soft forks have *given* miners the power over activation, but a UASF simply takes that power back.

Socials skills are largely irrelevant to that task, other than political ramifications, and I consider it a success if political influences are minimized as much as possible.

Again, too reductionist for me to find useful.  There is politics in bitcoin, always has been and always will be.  It's fundamentally a social system, created and operated by humans.  When people are in control, whether it's a few people in a board room or millions of people around the world forming a decentralized network, there will *always* be politics.  It's fundamental to the manner in which humans self organize.
Not all political systems are created equal, however.  The main difference between bitcoin and fiat monetary systems lies in their locations along the spectrum of centralization/decentralization of control.  There's politics all along that spectrum, but of different flavors.
And speaking of compromise, it's worth noting that for some notable core contributors, segwit itself is a compromise.  Some think the effective block size should be smaller, not larger, but they're willing to compromise because some degree of compromise is necessary if you want to work *with* others on a cooperative project.  That doesn't mean you agree to all compromises obviously, it just means you have to evaluate them on a case by case basis and that thinking of the concept of compromise as either a blanket good or bad is not a useful way to look at things.  It's a tool that is used situationally.

I don't see how you can avoid this problem with any fiat-crypto interface.  The primary way alts get around this issue is by trading for bitcoin instead of fiat.

It's money (has both the properties of a store of value and a medium of exchange).  Gold used to be money, but in our modern monetary systems we separate the store of value function (mostly sovereign debt, but also includes a wide variety of assets to varying degrees) and the medium of exchange function (currency).  There isn't a very good analogue for "money" in the modern financial system, which is why I think people tend to get confused.  They think bitcoin has to be either a medium of exchange or a store of value, but it's intended function is money and money needs both properties to thrive.
These aren't binary either/or categories by the way, it's more a spectrum.  So saying it "is" or "isn't" these things is going to be of limited utility.  
And yes, everything here is still highly speculative.  No one knows for sure what the bitcoin network is going to look like in 10 years.

There's nothing in greg's post to convince me that politics in Bitcoin doesn't exist (quite the opposite really), the idea that it's even possible to divorce human systems from politics is incoherent to me.

The opinion of the economic majority can be influenced by politics as well, not just the democratic majority. It's still opinions we're talking about, and opinions are subject to persuasion.  I call that process politics regardless of whether your end goal is to convince a democratic majority or an economic majority. 
I definitely think the politics of bitcoin (and the economic majority) is more resistant to the cheap and hollow rhetorical tactics we often see shamelessly evoked in our national/local democracies, but I see that as an improvement in the quality of the politics, not the elimination of it.

The only time the speed of the difficulty adjustment has been a potential issue at all was during the first big BCH pump back in Nov 17, when BCH temporarily spiked to as high as .5 BCH/BTC (very temporarily, but still).  That's because hash wasn't turned off, but redirected towards another SHA256 chain.  In that sort of situation, hashrate can potentially fluctuate quite rapidly, but even that wasn't a "death spiral" situation, just a temporary inconvenience.
Fluctuations in hashrate due to miners shutting off are far more gradual and have historically been *well* within the bounds of the difficulty adjustment parameters, so that's not really something that concerns me.
I've seen my fair share of "hashrate death spiral" arguments made over the past couple years; for the most part I don't think they were very well formulated and definitely exaggerated.  Yes, it'd be a problem if most of the hash disappears overnight, but the scenarios where that could potentially happen are very limited, and mostly revolve around minority fork cases.

There was no big fundamental event driving that crash other than the parabolic rally preceding it, though it was triggered by Mt.

Just to point out, interest levels for locking up bitcoin should be substantially lower than any levels we're used to talking about for fiat.  There's a big difference between an inflationary and deflationary unit of account in that respect.  People are already holding bitcoin with 0% nominal return; earning *any* interest on top of that would be gravy (I can't say exactly how small, but I'd expect it to be small).  Whereas no one holds inflationary cash long term since at the very least you can earn a few % nominally with some "risk-free" sovereign bonds, so any alternative has to at least do better than that (loaning money to the guy who can print money is considered a pretty safe bet, at least in nominal terms).
There's a massive capital pool of holders out there for bitcoin, not so for cash.  I suspect a very modest nominal ROI (&lt;.1%? will ultimately depend a lot on how secure participation can be made) will be enough to pull a sufficient amount of that capital into lightning channels to provide liquidity, but we'll see.
@_date: 2018-03-14 07:39:20
Point is there's already plenty of people happy to hold Bitcoin in cold/deep storage with zero nominal return, so there's definitely an ample potential liquidity source there. The only factor is what return is required to offset the security risks of storing in a channel rather than cold storage. I'd expect to see that decrease as security solutions mature.

Personally I think that's a bigger advantage than a disadvantage relative to gold, since the digital nature is what allows transacting globally quickly and cheaply (how cheap depends on congestion lately, but this is an evolving system and I'm sure we'll get there).  With gold I have to ship a hunk of something or use a custodial solution (transferring certificates of ownership).  I can grant this is subjective, but to me the digital asset is preferable for its native transferability (not to mention effortless divisibility).
Also the thing about money is its monetary properties become stronger as more people use it as money.  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy in some ways, so a degree of speculation is unavoidable when talking about monetary potential.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:52:41
Gold is better at being jewelry, conducting electricity, etc.  But for monetary properties, bitcoin is better *unless* you think money needs non-monetary utility as a basis for valuation.  I don't, and considering most people are happy using fiat, they shouldn't object either (the "full faith and credit of the government" means jack shit in practice; ask a venezuelan).
Gold's main monetary advantage over bitcoin is, as others have said, simply tradition and the trust that goes along with that.

Those metrics are just highly correlated to price.  That doesn't make them leading indicators.  
Check out [google analytics from back in 2013]( the last time we really had this kind of volatility.

IMO, it's pretty simple, a PoW change is a last resort measure that you only use if the majority of the hashrate is actually "attacking" the network (via DoS attack or re-org attacks or malicious acts of that nature).  If a post-split hashrate ratio is tiny then that could be another reason (you don't want attacks to be trivial), but if the ratio is relatively balanced then attacks are still "expensive".
A PoW change is smart to have ready to use if necessary, but I would agree it's not something to be used preventatively, you use it as a response to an actual attack (and miners simply leaving to mine another chain is obviously not an attack, but using their hashrate to disrupt other chains would be).

It becomes a bigger problem than it needs to be when people unnecessarily empower them.  Like Coinbase is doing here.  That's why I think we need to move away from this model of asking miners to speak for the market; it disproportionately and unnecessarily empowers them.  A simple change in thinking is all that's needed for that to stop.  
Miners don't have the power to dictate which coin is called what.  Coinbase is giving them that power in this case, under the justification that they're letting the "market" decide, but that seems bogus when market price is the obvious indicator of market support.  Instead they choose a metric at the mercy of agreements between a few people.  Seems a bit disingenuous to say this is "letting the market decide".

I think you're severely underestimating work ethic.  Luck and social connections def play a part, but these guys also tend to be obsessively hard workers with extreme focus on their job.
Also being a successful CEO is a lot about operational/business sense, not necessarily abstract vision of the broad tech future.  Having a good vision is certainly important in guiding a company long term, but if your main skill is being a "visionary" then there's a good chance that doesn't make for a great CEO (some exceptions of course).
If you're looking for the established "tech visionaries", that'd mostly be the well-respected VCs imo.  Their job is really to be visionary about a broad tech future, and they've (generally speaking) been pretty heavily into bitcoin/crypto for a while.
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:45:38
It's odd that the reasoning used is "letting the market decide" but they're not going to use market price as the main indicator (this is the market's primary signal).  Instead they're going to use miner votes essentially, which is a small subset of the industry/market and susceptible to cartelization.
- if you guys want to "let the market decide" (which I agree is the right move on your part), I'd argue that price is a much better and broader indicator of market support than hashrate.  Thoughts?  I know that "market cap" is mentioned as a possible consideration in the blog post, but why isn't it the primary one?  What better indication of "market support" is there than the price?  Certainly miner support is less representative of the overall market, not more.
Letting miners speak for "the market" is a practice we should be moving away from, not towards imo.  It's a poor model, and one that's causing a lot of unnecessary friction.  Miners are the security guards at the bank, they're hired to do a job (hashing blocks according to the rules of the network), nothing more, nothing less.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:42:37


Not saying it's perfect, but price is a vastly superior measure of "market support" than what a few miners think.  
Knowing how specialized and consolidated mining has become, it's honestly indefensible at this point to keep trotting out this notion that miners are representative of the market.  We need to kill that notion once and for all; it's obviously not true.  Miners are specialized labor hired by the network to perform a specific service, nothing more, nothing less.  The situation with mining becomes a lot less problematic when we start acknowledging their role properly.  
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:20:11


Price is the real leading indicator.  Hashrate follows price; an exception being when someone is willingly mining at a relative loss, which usually isn't a situation that lasts for too long since no one likes leaving free money on the table.  


The concern is the fact that accumulated difficulty is not at all the best indicator of market support, yet that's the metric the blog post clearly states will be used.  It's a poor choice to use as a proxy for market support, and I definitely wouldn't describe it as a leading indicator for the market; if anything it's an indicator for a select few special interests (that's the unfortunate reality of mining these days, as we're all aware, but we make it far worse than it needs to by unnecessarily delegating power their way).
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:21:34


I assumed it was because lower transaction fees are better for business?  Even if you're passing on the fees to users, that's still less overall friction if fees are lower.

It's hard to get a good read on what Satoshi's real "vision" was since I definitely don't get the sense that he was an open book. I think it's fair to say that he wasn't really looking to draw attention to himself (from the pseudonym to his reaction to the wiki leaks drama - "don't bring it on" - I don't take that to mean he doesn't support wiki leaks, but rather that he didn't want to publicize that position).  The environment at the time was one of alternative currency creators going to jail, after all.  I don't think it's much of a stretch to say that he had a tendency to lean towards moderate appearances, but what's far less clear is if that's because that's how he actually felt or that's the image he wanted to project.  He was pretty much the opposite of DPR in that sense.
What's clear is that the choices he made for the protocol have pretty clear political implications (the fixed supply in particular is a direct condemnation of modern monetary policy which goes hand in hand with our institutions of central banking).  He doesn't talk much at all about the political context of those choices, but the potential explanations are that they were either made out of fairly severe ignorance of the prevalent macroeconomic positions, or he knew the implications and just didn't want to openly discuss or emphasize them.  The latter imo is pretty consistent with his overall approach and behavior, which I think leaves the "starting vision" of bitcoin with a healthy amount of uncertainty.

Negative EV bet in this context just means that your probability of winning multiplied by the payout for winning is less than the amount of money you payed in with.  


The only way it would make the rich richer is if the rich were the only ones who could make a positive EV bet.  Generally the way these things work (or should work) is that everyone gets the same negative EV bet, but their amount of buy-in can vary, which affects their odds of winning but *not* the EV of the bet since the more you buy in with, the smaller the payout becomes proportionally to your buy in.  If the house takes zero cut, then this could be a neutral EV bet.  Unless something really fucky is going on, there shouldn't be any way to make a positive EV bet.


Again, "virtually guaranteed to win" is as uninformative a statement as when you said the little guy had zero chance to win.  Having a 99% chance to win $1001 is a bad bet if you had to pay $1000 to make that bet  (.99 * 1001 = ~991, in other words you have to pay $1000 to get back $991 on average).  What determines a good bet or not is your expected value, not just your odds of winning.  That's just one factor in your expected value.
Simple question for you - do you think it's a good idea to buy a shit ton of lottery tickets and expect to make money that way?  If not... why not?  This is the same principle.

He certainly is, but I still think you rather overstated your point with your parachute analogy.  It'd be like if he acknowledged the parachute was there for safety, but when asked why a parachute rather than, say, a giant pillow, and he answered "tradition" when the real answer is that the parachute is the most practical and effective safety apparatus.  I think that's a rather important distinction.  One makes him sound like a complete idiot, the other is more understandable bias and careful phrasing from a man in his position.

Wouldn't that just leave Monero restricted to black market activity?  If they're going to crack down on bitcoin users mixing through Monero, I'm assuming the same restrictions would apply to anyone using Monero period (including businesses/exchanges), and just because the blockchain is private doesn't mean the government can't identify users in other old fashioned ways (at least if you're trying to interact with the "legal" regulated economy).

What I'm trying to tell you is that the lottery was probably fine.  Just because someone has a high chance of winning, doesn't mean they're making money.  A lot of people don't seem to understand the difference between odds of winning and expected value, but the latter is what determines whether you win or lose in the long run, not the former.  This misunderstanding is why the martingale betting strategy is a thing, and it's a misunderstanding that does a great job of separating people from their money.  Assuming your lottery ticks the most basic fundamentals of fairness (that is, that everyone has the same EV), then those big players making big bets were actually losing more money (in an absolute sense) than average, not winning more.  That can be true even if they won most of the time - that's the distinction between probability of winning and expected value.
**Again, simple question for you** - why don't rich people just buy up all the actual lottery tickets and keep getting richer that way?  If they buy an obscene amount, they can almost guarantee they'll win.  All this back and forth has just been to try to explain why that's not a winning strategy.  As far as I know, there is no legal limit to how many lottery tickets you can buy, so why don't they do this?

I could see that potentially being useful if and only if the addresses you're sending to are otherwise empty.  Does that sound right?  Otherwise this is just a costly and convoluted way to basically make a list.  
If the address already has a balance, you can watch it just the same for any combinations with other inputs without sending BTC to it first.  That's just normal blockchain forensics.  Incrementing the balance by a small amount doesn't change the situation in any way unless the balance was zero.

It would cut into some of their payment processing functions, but that's far from the only reason banks exist.  I also don't think it will entirely replace payment processing middle men, but rather will work to lower barriers to entry in the field and serve as a baseline alternative to keep unreasonable regulations and monopolistic business practices in check.
Compare that to modern central banking, which quite clearly has zero role in a bitcoin monetary system.
Any summary of bitcoin that doesn't include a mention of its finite supply and strict ownership properties is a very poor summary of bitcoin's overall utility.  Yes, that includes the opening sentence of the white paper abstract when taken in isolation.
IMO, a bank has two options - they can either go the way of Kodak and stubbornly refuse to recognize a fundamental innovation in their industry, or they can try to become the future Nikon/Canon and adapt around the innovation and maintain their prominence in the aspects of their industry that carry over.  My point is that there are several aspects of the industry that can carry over - the primary one that will not is central banking (that's the film in this analogy).  Payment processing will certainly become more competitive, but I doubt it will go away entirely.
The fact that you can "be your own bank" with bitcoin certainly highlights some of its fundamentally important qualities, but that's not at all the same thing as saying everyone will *want* to be their own bank.  The fact that they *can* is significant enough in itself.

The expected value for the little guy doesn't change.  The bigger the pot, the smaller his chances, but the larger the potential payoff.  That's how all lotteries work.  Nothing stops someone from buying a million lottery tickets other than good financial sense, and that sense is directly concerned with expected value.  As long as expected value is fair for all, I don't see the problem.  Saying the little guy has "zero" chance is an abuse of approximations.
In your original comment, you said the "smart players with a lot of coin" kept making big bets.  Were these negative EV bets?  If so, why on earth are they smart?  Gambling against house odds with the expectation of profit is not what I would call smart.  They just have a poor understanding of statistics - the same sort of idiocy you find in people who think the martingale betting strategy is a good idea in practice.

There's a huge distinction between the two - running a darknet market is in itself a crime and an immense legal risk; the longer you stay at it, the more opportunity you have to get caught.  Running with the money doesn't make you any more of a criminal at that point (at least in the eyes of the law).
Localbitcoins might skirt some legal gray area here and there, but it's entirely legitimate in comparison to running a darknet market, so there's far less downside to keeping the business going and collecting your fees over time.  Alternatively, if you take the money and run, you're now a criminal and have to spend the rest of your life hiding from that fact, not to mention the risk that you get caught and end up behind bars.
The propositions are in fact very different.

There's going to be a real niche for alternative blockchains with certain application-specific technical properties until sidechains (or something similar) become a reality, if they do at all.  
For now, don't look at those alternative blockchains as money, look at them as distributed services that you pay to use (alt-chain developers aren't doing themselves any favors here by naming everything ___coin, but that's a separate issue).  I don't see how that can't coexist with bitcoin, unless of course sidechains come about and are a clearly superior alternative.
I'm as big of a "there can only be one" currency network effect believer as anyone else, I just don't think all blockchains have to be monetary in nature (doesn't mean they can't have value as long as they provide value).  Bitcoin is the money chain, but until we come up with a way to integrate sidechains with varying technical properties, there will probably be a valid niche for certain service-oriented blockchains that will have a modest amount of monetary value due to the services they provide.  Blockchains are basically just a form of a distributed database, and  accounting for a monetary system (aka a ledger) is one use of a database, but far from the only one.  Other uses may be better served by blockchains with different technical properties, and recognition of that fact is why some smart bitcoin people are working on sidechains in the first place.
If they become a reality, I'm sure developers of things like Alexandria will be happy to take advantage, but in the meantime they're working with the tools available to them, and that's a good thing imo.

Apparently gyft recently switched from accepting 0 confirms to requiring 1 confirmation.  I don't know what qualifies as "significant" but it's at least an indication that the problem is perhaps not negligible, at least for certain merchants.  The fact that bitpay isn't willing to guarantee 0 confirm transactions is an indication as well.
Having said that, I feel like bitpay could just scatter a few nodes all over the world and use them to check for any double spend attempts; they should know within seconds whether a transaction is trying to be double spent (a concerted attempt to double spend by a major mining pool would still be problematic, but it should safely rule out any rogue attempts at double spending).

There's an extremely strong incentive for hashrate to follow price (direct profit motive).  The only incentive for price to follow hashrate is for potential security implications.  
Normally, you can basically model the situation as hashrate chasing price.  That's what's happening 99% of the time.

I know "bitcoin vs banks" is practically a meme at this point, but if you don't distinguish between central banking and banks, then I don't think you actually understand the significance of bitcoin.
Note that there is a degree of overlap between central banks and private banks due to primary dealer relationships and other tie-ins with central banking, but the key point here is that no such privilege exists in the bitcoin ecosystem.  Very fundamental changes to the protocol (mainly those concerning bitcoin issuance and ownership) would have to be made to make an equivalent relationship possible.  Private banking existed before central banking, and it's not going to go away with bitcoin.
"Banks" were never the competitors of bitcoin, central banking is.  This distinction often gets lost since the major banks of today have a rather incestual relationship with central banking, but unless some very fundamental changes are made to the protocol, that relationship will not carry over no matter how much these big banks invest in the bitcoin ecosystem.
If you ever see them proposing changes to the fundamental issuance/ownership protocols of bitcoin, that's where the line should be drawn.

You can't "shut it down", but you can make life miserable for those who get caught using it.  Management of violence is still the underlying foundation of any attempts at a civilized protocol.  Bitcoin is an attempt at that protocol, but old-fashioned government still monopolizes violence, at least today, and that's because most people recognize and accept that power structure.  It will take serious shifts in public opinion to start to change that.
If public opinion sways heavily enough towards bitcoin, then it becomes difficult to persecute users without facing the backlash over public perceptions of authoritarianism, but if it's just a small minority then few will give a shit.  It doesn't matter how right you are or how perfect math is, if 100 people think you're doing something bad and are willing to fight you over it, you will probably lose.  There's no shortage of examples in history of good ideas that were before their time, and were squashed merely by the failure of society in general to recognize them.

I didn't mean everyone literally ran their own printing press, I meant the primary benefit of the printing press (cheaply mass-replicating information) was so universally useful that pretty much everyone benefited from it (either as producer or consumer of information), regardless of if they had any interest in censorship resistance.  It's not like people were looking at it and asking, "why would I even use this thing??", and that the key usage that spurred its adoption was to avoid censorship (that's what I think of as a "killer app").  The benefits were quickly obvious to everyone, and anything relating to censorship resistance was pretty obviously secondary to the primary benefit of just being able to efficiently copy information (seriously, copying by hand is insanely inefficient in comparison, and information is valuable to everyone).
You don't have to look for a killer app to explain the success of the printing press, unless the "killer app" is the obvious use of just producing copies of information quickly and cheaply, but usually the term is reserved for a catalytic use case that isn't completely obvious from the start.

Holding the debt of the currency issuer in an inflationary monetary system is the functional equivalent of hoarding cash in a deflationary monetary system.
Currency issuers don't need to borrow (they issue the currency after all), but they do need to give people (major global net-producers in particular) a way to save their "cash" in order to give their inflationary currency stability and value. 
Saving and spending are the two pillars of any monetary system.  Inflationary monetary systems only work because the currency issuers (at least the ones with currencies worth a damn) allow savers to save with modestly positive real rates (on average) by issuing sovereign debt.

Bitcoin-as-currency has ramifications on both government funding and monetary policy, both very politically sensitive topics.  A lot of people just don't want to deal with the backlash of commenting on such things unless absolutely necessary (or unless they're openly involved in politics already).

Most gold changes hands very infrequently. It has very low velocity as a monetary asset, since physically moving gold around is a pain in the ass.  It has a quite high transaction "cost" due to the practical realities of a physical bearer instrument. 
It may have "no limit" but it's not a cheap transaction network from a real costs point of view.  That's why gold used in trade usually ends up at a central clearing house where some account ledgers are edited rather than actual gold transferred.

While related, I would say "censorship resistance" was pretty clearly secondary to the fact that it was a bajillion times faster than making copies by hand.  I don't know if that counts as an "app" but I think it's safe to say that was the primary utility (one that those trying to avoid censorship could take advantage of as well, of course). Everyone benefitted from the printing press, regardless of if they needed censorship resistance.  The cost of replicating information in large volumes was drastically lower.

It very well may, but my point is that the war is not making the whales any richer.  I just want to agree on that point at least, I'm happy to concede that it may not be the ideal replacement for for *other* reasons.  As long as one of those reasons is not that it will be abused by the rich to get richer.  It might be used by the rich to give them a high probability of winning... but they won't actually be making any money in the long run.  That's the distinction I'm focused on.  It's not smart money, it's dumb money, or at best neutral money if there's no house cut.  But regardless, it's fair to all involved, rich or poor.

IMO, we just need to accept that we're talking about a complex trade-off that isn't subjectable to some simple and objective analysis we can all agree on.  That means that we're all just working with opinions based off gut-feeling here.  I think that's the main theme of these debates - we're drawing a line based on a gut instinct.

And my point is that it's mathematically provable that those big players were losing money on average.  Again, this can be true *despite* the fact that they won *almost* all the time.  This is exactly why I threw out that example of paying $1000 for a 99% chance to win $1001.  That's a losing bet despite the fact that you have a 99% chance to win, and you can tweak the numbers to fit your example, but from the description you provided, it should still be a negative EV bet, meaning over the long run they will lose money.  
I'll ask again - why don't rich people buy up all of the actual lottery tickets and get richer that way?  The more they buy, the better their odds of winning.

One thing I'd note is:


Up until 1970, we were on some form of a gold standard.  In the last 40 years, I feel our currency has been pretty terribly managed, and I think what's going on currently with the Fed and QE1/QE2 (soon to be QE3/4/5) is straight up robbery that's not labeled as such since it's being performed by the regulative authority.  Take what the fed is doing with the dollar, change the currency to bitcoins, replace the fed with some unnamed hacker, and what would you call it?  Yes, it's being done in the name of stabilizing an economy... how absolutely convenient.

Wait... THAT doesn't make you laugh??  And here I was thinking you were some kind of realist.
The reality is - we're damned if we do, damned if we don't, and the reason is simple - people generally suck.  No solution is going to overcome that basic fact, the reality is we have to somehow evolve PAST sucking (and yes, I do believe in evolution of human behavior - although I think it's fundamentally rooted in an advancement in the general state of consciousness, the idea of self, the realization of the illusion of the ego - yup, I'm a "kook").  What I like about the bitcoin market is it doesn't give us an illusion of security (which is exactly what, long term, a central authority is) - it airs the dirty laundry out for everyone to see.  I think we all learn faster when the problems are made obvious, rather than sweeping them behind some "central authority" so we can all mindlessly go about our lives and pretend like everything is hunky-dory.  Hopefully the bitcoin market will draw attention to the fundamental problems that plague it and will result in some ingenious solutions - time will tell.

The principles of bitcoin are an amalgam of meritocracy, technocracy, and plutocracy.  There's definitely no democracy, which is what reddit's voting system is modeled after (although abuse by alt accounts makes it fall a bit short of that).  Your influence over bitcoin comes from your actions which are empowered by your knowledge, skills, wealth, and influence over others, whereas in a democracy everyone (at least in theory) gets equal influence regardless of anything else.
Downvote this if you want, but there is definitely no aspect of democracy in bitcoin, otherwise there would be some sort of 1 person = 1 vote voting system which is plainly absent from bitcoin.  The fact that is gaining popularity in response to people's dissatisfaction with is keeping with the principles of bitcoin, imo.

The answer is that it's a great way to lose money.  I guarantee you that if a rich person could place an instant order online for as many lottery tickets as they want, they still wouldn't, and if they did they wouldn't stay rich for very long.
I've explained why multiple times already, so at this point if you don't agree I give up.


Because your answer (that it would be impractical to buy a lot of lottery tickets) demonstrates that you still aren't getting what expected value is, and without that none of this discussion has any hope of making any sense.
I'm honestly not trying to attack you, I'm just trying to get this concept of expected value understood, otherwise this discussion is pointless.  Understanding expected value is a basic requirement in analyzing probabilistic systems.

Everyone sees the value of having a few bits on the device.  The debate is over whether including a mining chip is the best way to make that happen.

For non-enthusiasts, the majority of bitcoin users probably use it for darknetmarket purchases, or speculative trading if you want to include that as well.  A mainstream article is probably going to be written from a mainstream audience's perspective, so I don't see a big problem with how the article framed the discussion.

He doesn't need to move coins; signing a message *and releasing it for public verification* is an equivalent level of proof of key ownership.
He's the one who decided moving coins was the way to go, and now conveniently we get a story about how "the trust" might be interfering with that, with no reasonable reason provided for why he doesn't just sign a message instead, which is particularly suspicious since he already claims to have done so in private.  Is there some reason he can only sign messages in private that isn't "I need the controlled environment to manipulate the verification"?

Do you have a reasonable explanation as to why, if he does indeed have a likely "Satoshi" key, he didn't use it to present proof publicly?  Yes, there would still be some doubters (and rightfully so), but that would have made a huge difference in the legitimacy of his claim.  It's the difference between him being taken seriously in the court of public opinion as a potential "Satoshi" and him being viewed almost unanimously as a hoaxer.  
Sure, staging the key signing for Gavin isn't totally trivial, but Craig does appear to have a "security researcher" background (there's a lot of bullshit in his resume but that part seems to be the most legitimate) so the kind of trickery required to pull this off would be potentially within his skillset.  
Gavin used a computer provided by Craig's assistant ("factory sealed" doesn't mean shit), an internet connection that could have been compromised, didn't verify the integrity of the software used, and wasn't allowed to keep the signature for independent verification.  Manipulating a verification under those conditions isn't necessarily child's play but it's also well within the realm of possibility.  From Gavin's comments on the matter, it sounded like he went into that session already pretty convinced Craig was Satoshi, which is why he may have been too willing to overlook the various vulnerabilities of his "proof" session.

All I can say is I have close to zero confidence that altruism is a scalable source of network resources, so relying on that might as well be throwing in the towel.

There's a simple argument for why bitcoin can help reduce wealth inequality, and that's that the current system is a political one that can be leveraged to the advantage of those close to the money creation process (I'm mainly talking about the primary dealers of the fed here).  Circumventing concentrations of power that can be used to accumulate wealth is one way to reduce wealth inequality, and imo bitcoin does that.  For example, I know the bailouts were sold as "good for America", but I'm going to go out on a limb here and say they were disproportionately better for the wealthy than the poor (the banks got the bailout rather than the underwater homeowners, for example).  Trends in income inequality since 2008 would provide some support for that viewpoint.
Money and power tend to follow each other.  If you concentrate power in the hands of a few, don't be surprised if money disproportionately follows those few as well.  Bitcoin's potential for reducing wealth inequality is basically "addition by subtraction", by eliminating the insider's club that is the central banking system and its advantaged participants.

There's the "normal" vault which is just coinbase cold storage with some additional security measures (delays and notifications on withdrawals, ability to set up multiple email addy approval).  No key control but it makes it harder for a hacked/phished account to lead to lost coins.
The multi-sig vault is proper 2 of 3 multisig where you have sole possession of 1 key, shared possession of an encrypted key (you don't give them the encryption password so theoretically only you can actually unlock this key), and the 3rd key is kept by Coinbase.  Coinbase only has access to 1 key so they can't access your funds, and if Coinbase disappears overnight, you've got the two keys (because you backed them up of course) necessary to unlock your funds.  The vulnerability there is similar to blockchain.info - compromised servers could theoretically feed you malicious scripts to run which would expose your btc if you try to access it.

To be clear, the public proof of a signed message is the one that would actually be, for all practical purposes, irrefutable (in terms of proof of key ownership).  A private demonstration of the sorts described by Gavin is not "irrefutable", but it was enough to convince him "beyond a reasonable doubt".  Gavin's words:


Gavin knows what "irrefutable" evidence of key ownership is, and he wants it as well, as described here:


Gavin knows he wasn't presented irrefutable evidence; he does think he was presented fairly difficult to fake evidence that combined with his other subjective judgements convinced him "beyond a reasonable doubt" that Craig was Satoshi.  Nothing irrefutable about that though, and Gavin's comments show that he understands that.

Gavin specifically said that it was possible he was "bamboozled".  He mentioned hacked hotel wi-fi as a potential attack vector, but there are others as well, assuming his description of the private "proof" session is accurate.  A publicly published proof eliminates all of these attack vectors, and would truly be irrefutable in terms of proof of key ownership.


**Publicly** signing the message would be irrefutable (I made that specification in my previous comment, which you left out when paraphrasing me).  That way, anyone can verify the message under conditions completely independent of Craig Wright's influence; that's where the irrefutability comes from.  A private session under controlled circumstances is not irrefutable; there are a litany of potential attack vectors under those circumstances.

No point in even asking them about specific highly speculative investments; that's not their area of expertise.

I wouldn't give her a hard time though; she sees someone investing a majority of their net wealth in a very volatile and speculative asset, she wouldn't be doing her job if she wasn't expressing some concern imo.

Then the reality is that if and when quantum computing becomes a reality, there will be a massive gold rush for people to steal those unsecured coins instead.  Is that honestly better?  Anyone who wants to secure their coins will need to ensure they're secured by a quantum safe signature, that's true regardless of any proposal being discussed here.
I can see arguing for the quantum theft gold rush due to certain moral objections to the alternative, but I'm skeptical that's actually the best outcome.  That would likely mean whatever entity (or entities) has first access to a legitimate quantum computer gets to steal millions of bitcoins, probably a government intelligence agency or some big corp.
It'd be great if the original owners could just keep control of the coins, but under the scenario being considered that's not really an option unless they themselves move them to safe addresses, so you have to consider what you think the lesser evil would be.

Like pb1x said, there's significant doubts whether that was actually Satoshi speaking up about Dorian (the account appeared to be compromised later, and may have been at the time of that post), and second, these situations are different - Dorian didn't invite the claim, Leah thrust it upon him.  In that situation, there was an innocent victim - Dorian.  Maybe Satoshi felt inclined to try to help him (again, we don't know if the message was legit, just speculating here).
In the case of Craig, there is no innocent victim; Craig brought this on himself by claiming to be Satoshi.  If Satoshi originally spoke up in the Dorian case to help clear his name, then there's no reason to speak up this time around.

I'm a bit conflicted about the benefits of people altruistically hosting nodes as I'm worried it's not scalable and in the meantime could mask whatever incentive structure issues there might be in the bitcoin network, problems that would benefit from being properly recognized and dealt with sooner rather than later.
I do realize that there are benefits to hosting your own node (mainly for security/privacy reasons) - if those aren't enough to maintain a healthy network, then we really need to figure out how to incentivise it properly rather than hope people do it altruistically, because the latter imo is a temporary solution that won't scale at all past the "early adopter" phase.

The real global reserves are yield-bearing US treasury notes and bonds.  This is generally still referred to as "Dollars" since it's US debt but yield-bearing sovereign debt isn't the same thing as cash.  Inflationary cash is a bad reserve for obvious reasons.
What ultimately matters for reserve asset status is the quality and safety of yield.  The medium of exchange is really a separate issue which mainly revolves around whatever is most convenient (usually in consideration of the local laws).
I agree that perception matters for a store of value - the more people (and the capital they control) who see it as one, the more likely it is to be one.  I disagree that serving as a medium of exchange plays an important part in that role - no one pays for things with US treasuries, they first convert to cash (the current medium of exchange, but not the reserve asset).
There's also the role of the unit of account but I don't really want to get into that right now.

*Being digital* makes this concept very easy.  Like I said, adding a tracing layer and requiring businesses to use it is technically rather trivial and has no significant equipment overhead like a cash sorting machine.  Hell, it could just be another BIP on the protocol - "legal payment protocol required by X&amp;X government".
If you want to rely on the "too much of a hassle to do otherwise" defense for fungibility, then going digital is in itself a bad idea.  Again, this is fundamentally a *political problem*.

What makes it trivially easy is that the participants are voluntarily identifying themselves unless they'd rather risk whatever legal ramifications would come of operating illegally.  The risk/reward for the scenario depends both on how easy it'd be to get away with it and what the penalties are if you're caught.  Just because the currency is untraceable, doesn't mean you can't get caught (see: cash).
There's no technology that can prevent me from voluntarily identifying myself, and harsh legal consequences are in reality a pretty effective motivator.  These are problems that have to be dealt with politically.

Can't agree with your logic behind one large transaction being more effective spam than many small transactions.  Why is, for example, a 100 KB transaction with a 250 sat/byte fee rate more effective than 100 1 KB transactions with a 250 sat/byte fee rate?
In the simplest terms, they both take up 100 KB of space, will outcompete transactions paying less than 250 sat/byte (and not outcompete those paying more), and they cost the same amount in fees.  It shouldn't really make a difference in any significant way.

I'm repeating myself, but Gavin himself admitted that the circumstances under which he verified the signature were not irrefutable - that's implied by admitting it was possible he was bamboozled, even though he thought it was unlikely.  My emphasis on "public" is because that removes the possibility of a compromised environment, and truly makes the proof irrefutable as far as proving key validity is concerned.  The private demonstration described by Gavin is not irrefutable proof of key ownership; Gavin mentioned one potential attack vector and there are others.  
Maybe this is just me, but imo "irrefutable" evidence is not that which you admit was possible to be forged.  The definition of the word is that it's *impossible* to deny or disprove.  Conditions such as "unlikely" may play a part in determining reasonable doubt (which is the extent of what Gavin claimed), but not irrefutability.

If they want to do that, they could just make any untraceable currency illegal. Same thing.

You wouldn't trace every transaction on the underlying protocol, that wouldn't be possible.  What you would do is require the top level protocol to be used for legal commerce, and the ID would be in that protocol, not the underlying one.  If you're caught not using it, you get in legal trouble like you would now for not reporting cash dealing in your taxes, for example.  Accomplishing the above is technically trivial.  You aren't breaking any encryption or anything, people are voluntarily identifying their transactions by using the top level protocol, and they have to do so if they want to stay within the law.  That's how it would work.

Can you guys try to chill on the narrative control?  I get moderating out personal attacks, outright lies, clearly off-topic stuff, etc, but when you start trying to micromanage the narrative through vague and highly subjective rule enforcement is when I think the moderation becomes ultimately counterproductive.  
Most people don't understand all the fine technical details of bitcoin protocol development and they never will, but the average bitcoiner does have a strong aversion to these sorts of tactics (moderation or "censorship") being used to try to influence their opinion.  I think the narrative-control moderation policies end up preaching to the choir and turning off everyone else, which is highly unhelpful in the long run.

Agree, and they've acknowledged as much in their public statements.  They've also made it clear they don't plan to support ETC at the moment outside of the one time withdrawal for pre-fork GDAX ether holders, and they've also made it clear to not send ETC to them since they won't account for it.  
If ETC replay attacks are still happening with Coinbase withdrawals, the most likely explanation imo is that they're still receiving some unintentional ETC replay deposits and simply making no effort to prevent those being withdrawn (rather sloppy imo, but consistent with their publicly stated position and not a solvency threat unless you think they have an obligation to protect and honor ETC "deposits" after the fork).  If they're leaking the ETC accounted for their pre-fork GDAX ether holders then that's a bigger problem, but without further evidence indicating that specifically then I'd assume it's the former issue.

Are you using the ETHC chain participation as a way to measure opposition to the hard fork?  You can be against the fork but not so much so that you're willing to fork away from the majority.  For example guys like Fred and Anthony Di Iorio, not to mention a fair number of other prominent members of the ethereum community that still stuck around.
On another note, how do you think it would go if the ethereum community wanted a fork but the foundation was against it?  I'm not saying that's the same as the current bitcoin situation (I think the foundation probably has even more influence over its respective ecosystem than Core), I'm just saying the challenges bitcoin faces with forking will be much the same ones ethereum faces when it has to deal with a fork *that's sufficiently contentious*, and that's not a matter of if but when (that goes for all blockchain consensus protocols that survive long enough to face these problems).

I don't see why it has to be any different with non-voting nano nodes?  In bitcoin, non-mining nodes accept the chain with the most PoW as the consensus order of transactions, but all other rules must be followed otherwise it will be rejected as invalid.  Likewise, in nano a non-voting node will accept the results of voting for determining the consensus order of transactions, but they can also reject any state that violates the network rules.  Why would they delegate full verification when it's completely unnecessary to do so and defeats the purpose of running a full node in the first place?  It doesn't make any engineering sense to do that.


No arguments there.  I just don't see that as significantly different than one party controlling 25% of hashrate (not that I think anyone does).  We still seem to disagree over whether the voting process impacts more of the consensus protocol than just transaction ordering (it would be quite bizarre and unnecessary if it does).

The same thing a non-mining node in bitcoin can do if miners produce an invalid block - reject it.
"Voting" in proof of stake/delegation consensus protocols is just a replacement for the mining function (transaction ordering), no more and no less.  It doesn't need to control all aspects of network consensus, just as mining doesn't in bitcoin.  The rest of the network dynamics and power structures aren't necessarily affected.

It doesn't really matter if they like it or not. Mining is driven by a profitability equilibrium based on difficulty and the value of block rewards.

Just because Vitalik or someone else codes up a hard fork, it doesn't mean a hard fork happens.  You have to convince the ecosystem (miners, exchanges, users) to run it.  Maybe he could do that, maybe he couldn't, but just because the ecosystem potentially supports this hard fork doesn't mean they'll support a different one.  All hard forks are case by case; it's like that with all blockchains including bitcoin.
I'm not saying precedents have *zero* influence; they probably have some non-zero psychological affect on the participants in the ecosystem, but the extreme of "if one hard fork proposal goes through then so will all others" is obviously absurd.

Because I don't think that's correct.
Voting fulfills the same role in nano consensus as mining does in bitcoin consensus - order transactions and resolve double spends.  All other rules are enforced by all nodes; both in bitcoin and nano.  It makes perfect engineering sense that that's how it would work; I'm not sure why you think otherwise.  There's no reason to have full nodes that don't verify anything (we wouldn't even call such a thing a "full node" in the first place).

It would reject a consensus change, yes (and the result would be fork).  A block rewind/re-org it would accept, yes, just as a non-mining node wouldn't reject a block re-org if it had greater proof of work.


It will get "removed", aka there will be a fork if you have incompatible consensus rules being enforced by various nodes.  Again, the same thing happens in bitcoin.


Again, and I think this is the fundamental source of our disagreement - the voting function only pertains to transaction ordering, not *all* consensus rules.  This is the same dynamic as in bitcoin, where non-mining nodes delegate the transaction ordering aspect of consensus to the mining process but enforce all other rules themselves.  You're just substituting one process (mining) for another (voting) that fulfills the same function, nothing else needs to necessarily change.

I think there's a good and moral argument for funding a UBI through natural resource revenues.  I firmly believe that "the value I produce should be mine and mine alone", so I agree that none of the wealth I produce should be redistributed against my will.  However I also believe that no person produced the natural resources we find here in our world; all we can do is add value to them.  The added value should be our own, but the value of the raw natural resources belongs to no one imo, at which point the reasonable thing to do is to share it ([Georgism]( is one example of this sort of idea).  
The problem is the "first to claim ownership" model which we've used to deal with natural resource ownership is so engrained in our economy and values, yet I consider it fundamentally flawed and immoral.  A better model imo would be some sort of auctioning of natural resource *rights* for given time periods, with the revenue going to fund a UBI (basically just split it with everyone).  No one created the raw natural resources of the world, so it doesn't make sense to me that the first person to claim them possesses the rights to them forever (or any derivative of such a structure). 
In spirit, it's kind of like saying every human has the right to "live off the land" (partake in their fair share of natural resource usage).  You shouldn't have to purchase that right from those that were here before you.  A UBI funded by natural resource revenue would be a modern interpretation of that idea.
How to administrate such a system is where it gets tricky, but that's where the decentralized systems we're just starting to properly explore may be interesting.  I think it's potentially doable with the non-coercive tools of reputation and economic incentives.

If the only way to deal with vote brigading was to ban certain topics of discussion that are pretty relevant to bitcoin (at least imo, I didn't support XT/classic/whatever but I did want to keep up to date with any developments just because I like to stay informed) then that's unfortunate.  I thought sorting by controversial was a better way to deal with it than banning topics entirely.  I don't really care about upvotes/downvotes but I understand that some people do.
If it wasn't clear, I was agreeing that moderation can be helpful, but I was also clarifying where I personally thought it went too far and became unhelpful.  Just my opinion.
I've never called it "censorship" for what it's worth.  Just varying degrees of good/bad moderation.

And I personally think it's possible... and that's it.  I have no reason to be convinced either way of its truth or falsehood.  I could pick one based on instincts, but it seems painfully obvious to me that there is not sufficient proof to believe either one or the other to be objectively true.
What bothers me about conspiracy theories is that everyone is cock-sure of themselves - whether they think it's true or false.  What happened to having a nuanced opinion that stays open to all possibilities?  To me, the primary folly when it comes to conspiracy theories is not which conclusion you choose but the confidence with which people reach a conclusion.  The truth, imo, is that we can't know, we can only speculate.  That's kind of the point of conspiracies, after all.

That's the equivalent situation as miners deciding on competing valid blocks via hashing, where the losing block gets orphaned.  It's not a question of enforcing network rules, just transaction ordering, and thus non-mining nodes don't "vote" in this case (since both blocks are valid according to consensus rules), they just follow the longer chain.
It's a pretty simple analogy imo:
voting nodes : NANO :: mining nodes : bitcoin
likewise, 
non-voting nodes : NANO :: non-mining nodes : bitcoin

AFAIK NANO full nodes (voting or not) validate transactions according to the network rules just the same as a bitcoin full node (isn't that the main reason to operate a full node for either network?).  
The voting function is analogous to the mining function in bitcoin in that it decides transaction ordering and resolves double spends, and I'm pretty sure you can't just vote in anything you want as "valid", it has to follow the rules enforced by all nodes.  For example, I don't think a nano voting node can just generate new coins for itself and it'll be accepted by non-voting nodes as "valid", if that's what you're saying.
Again, the analogy between the relationships between the different types of nodes is pretty straight forward.  Why do you think it's substantially different?  Just replace "mining" with "voting"; they fulfill analogous functions for network consensus (transaction ordering, i.e. resolving double spends).

I thought I covered this clearly actually!  Let's assume this productive enterprise will generate growth in excess of what the economy is already generating - in a 2% growth economy, let's say we think it can generate 4%.  To be clear so we don't trip up over numbers here, in this case a 1% nominal interest rate loan needs to produce real value equal to 3% in order to be manageable in bitcoins, due to the 2% appreciation inherent in bitcoins.  What's stopping a 1% nominal loan from being offered in this case?  Nothing!  That loan will be made, and it will be profitable for both parties.  The only loans that will truly suffer are those that do not outperform the background growth rate of the economy, and my whole point is thats a *good* thing, because offering those loans would in fact slow the economy down since you're diverting funds from their role in the rest of the economy (which, again, is apparently producing a better return than the value this loan would create).  I think we can all agree that there's no point in offering loans that slow down the economy!


I personally think being able to easily save in an appreciating asset would ultimately help the middle class.  Your money itself is now an appreciating asset!  And personally, taking on a huge loan to "own" property (that I'll be paying off for a long time) doesn't exactly sound like the dream to me.  If housing prices go the wrong way you're screwed - potentially even underwater.  That's risk I could do without.  I mean, think about it - you may have to save for a long while to buy a house (savings that will be appreciating all the while, I'll add), but presently even if you "buy" a house you're still going to have to be paying for it for a long while and won't own it debt free until you're done paying it off anyway.

That's rather naive.  Any "consensus" is going to be a political compromise of some sort since naturally people will have different opinions over what's the "ideal" implementation of bitcoin.

Sure, gold has way more history.  That's obvious.  Bitcoin has only been around ~4 years, it needs time to build trust.  The fact that it's new however is not an argument that it will never gain that trust.  Based on its properties, it has the potential to build that trust, and to serve that role even better than gold.  Obviously it's not there yet, but we're trying to project the future here, right?  If we just accept that things will stay the way they are now forever then this discussion is pointless.
And regarding industrial uses, sure gold is useful in electronics, but in tiny quantities.  It's mostly used as plating, and one of gold's characteristics is that it can be plated ridiculously thin.  ~7% of the yearly mining supply goes towards electronics.  90% goes towards bars/bullion/jewelry.  That makes it pretty clear that its value is derived almost entirely from non-industrial uses.

Did you read the O'Hagan article?  The full version appears to be behind a paywall now, but it was up in full when it was first published.  He "came out" because doing so was a requirement of his deal to sell "Satoshi's IP" (to the tune of ~$25 million, if I remember correctly).  The deal was contingent on him "proving to the world" that he was Satoshi - the implication being that the real value of what he was trying to sell was not the IP itself, but the potential name attached to it.  He needed that money to save himself and his company from bankruptcy.
Perhaps he appeared "under tremendous pressure and very reluctant to reveal himself" because he was being forced to perpetrate his fraud in a far more public way than he was comfortable with (or confident in being able to pull off) in order to secure his financial bailout?  If he could have just gotten his money without the whole "public Satoshi reveal" aspect he would have been more than happy to, I assume.  It's much easier to fool a few individuals than to stand up to the scrutiny of full public review.
He had backed himself into a corner where he had little choice but to try to prove to the world he was Satoshi.  What we saw was likely his best attempt at doing so.  Hence all the hooplah and theatrics while avoiding the simple concrete proof that would have been trivial for the real Satoshi to provide.  He put off providing the real proof for as long as he could, and when he was unable to plausibly delay any further, he bailed.
I could never understand how someone could look at these facts of the story and think, "yeah, he's probably Satoshi."  The story makes little sense if he is, and a lot of sense if he isn't.
*edit* - Just to add one more aspect of the story that reeks of bullshit (there are plenty more, but I've already put more time into this than I care to) - the real Satoshi is presumably sitting on a fortune in bitcoins and would have no reason to be legitimately concerned with bankruptcy, particularly if he's willing to reveal himself.  Craig Wright's explanation was that the bitcoins were "locked in a trust".  How convenient for his story, but if that alone doesn't trigger your BS detector then it's probably broken.

The purchasing power of bitcoins is going up, regardless of whether you convert it back to dollars or not.  That's something people tend to get excited about, since they're effectively becoming wealthier in terms of their purchasing power.
Price volatility is not a great thing, however a currency with a market cap of ~1 billion dollars (which is where it's hovering right now) is very small and can only represent a small market.  If bitcoins are poised for the bigtime, then that *has* to go up, and substantially.  It's not something to complain about, and you hope it eventually stabilizes at a much higher level.  If you want bitcoin to succeed as a currency, then you want it going up, at least for now.

Like I said, I disagree that the argument re: block 1 makes sense.  The argument rests on the long delay (5 days) between the genesis block and block 1, but block 1 was mined the same day Satoshi actually released the software.  The genesis block wasn't mined in the normal sense; it's hard coded in the software as an initialization block.  It's something Satoshi would have created while finalizing the software for release.  IMO the perfectly reasonable explanation is Satoshi started mining when he released the software.
In other words, I don't see a convincing reason to treat block 1 any differently than 2-12.  I can't rule out that someone else mined it of course; I'm just saying the five day delay between 0 and 1 is not a reason to think so.

I'm just saying that type of behavior sends the price higher.  Everyone's trying to buy bitcoins to get out and no ones looking to sell.  That's not what's happening at Gox right now.  When bitfloor died, for example, the price started shooting up before trading was halted.


This imo is definitely a possibility.  I do think though that they could sell coins with a bit more subtlety.

This crash seems to be clearly a result of very restrictive regulatory actions by China.  The timing of the sell-offs corresponds directly to bad news out of China.  If that's the case, this sell off is caused by a real change in fundamentals - the regulatory environment in China.  That doesn't really have anything to do with bubbles or fools rushing in.  Crashes due to those reasons usually happen with little to no change in fundamentals.  For example, tulips.  Or did the tulip bubble crash because a major player in the market significantly restricted their use?

ACH transfers can be disputed for up to 60 days after they happen.  I don't think the main problem is regular people trying to rip off coinbase with their own accounts, but probably scammers with stolen account info looking to use bitcoin to steal money anonymously.  Even if you have someone's bank info, you need a way to steal the money without getting caught.  Bitcoin can be rather useful for those purposes, which is probably why coinbase needs to be pretty diligent in weeding out scammers.  Otherwise they make a sale, scammer runs off with the bitcoin, then a day or more (up to two months) later they get a fraud dispute for the charge and the transfer gets reversed.  Even better for the scammer, they can make their own legit account on coinbase and sell the stolen bitcoin there with no worries about it being traced back to stolen funds.  Now the scammer has a nicely streamlined process for converting stolen bank info into laundered cash in their own account.

Only one thing is needed to discourage speculators - price stability.  Price stability is different from supply stability, since supply is only half of the supply and demand equation.  Introducing a new currency means you need to succesfully go from zero demand to a lot of demand.  In order to do that while maintaining price stability, you need to actively manage supply - no fixed rate or anything like that is going to result in price stability.  You need the equivalent of the bitcoin federal reserve if you want to actively maintain price stability.

That's the part I don't necessarily agree with.  You're making that conclusion after bitcoin has been around for only 4 years?  These things take time.  The fact is bitcoin does actually have many advantages over gold - for one, its rate of monetary inflation will actually go to zero, whereas gold will continue to be mined for the indefinite future.  That means bitcoin is more reliably scarce than gold (# of arbitrary units has nothing to do with this, the rate of % supply expansion is all that matters).  It's also far cheaper to transfer, divide, and verify.  Gold fell into its cultural role because it had certain properties, not the other way around.  Bitcoin has a lot of good properties.  Whether it builds a monetary role around those properties is what remains to be seen, but it's off to a hell of a start.
Also, my quick google search (wiki article) says 50% jewelry and 40% investment products (bars and bullion), but how much of that jewelry do you think is Indian people who view gold jewelry as a store of wealth?  Those categories overlap in many cultures.

Since you were comparing to NANO, isn't a non-mining node in bitcoin comparable to a non-voting node in NANO?  I'm not a NANO expert by any means but I'm assuming the voting function applies to the ordering of transactions (similar to mining) but each node, voting or not, enforces its own network consensus rules (a la bitcoin's non-mining nodes).
In other words, while I agree that non-mining nodes have "power" within the bitcoin network (mainly in terms of the economic weight behind any given set of consensus rules, as seen via proposals like the segwit UASF), functionally they do seem analogous to what you described as non-voting nodes in NANO.

People theorize everything.  I don't see the logic in that particular theory.  If they wanted to be able to see the movement of all money, they could just slowly restrict the practicality of cash until all banking was done online.  Then they'd be able to see it all without dealing with the psuedonymous, decentralized, and deflationary nature of bitcoin.
I don't see how bitcoin can be construed to be advantageous at all to our current power structures.  The only way it could possibly be so is if they somehow implemented a backdoor or something hidden in plain sight in the code, but I don't think that's realistic at all.  Hiding something like that is orders of magnitude harder (from a cleverness standpoint) than finding it.  The government/banking system may have great resources at their disposal, but I don't think they have a huge advantage by any means in terms of intelligence, especially considering all the bright minds who have looked at the source code.

I put in an order at 200 and received it at a few days later when the price was 280 or so.  I don't think they're actively trying to scam people; they're probably just very conservative in terms of setting guidelines for what qualifies as "high risk" and it's hard to blame them because so many bitcoin exchanges in the US have had their bank accounts shut down due to "suspicion of illegal behavior" (at least that's the reason given).  I used to use bitfloor and they seemed to be complying with anti-money laundering laws but still one day poof, shut down.
Selling bitcoins in the US is in itself a high risk activity.  Just be patient and work with support (whenever they might get around to you; I heard they're trying to hire to keep up with brisk business) and they should honor your price eventually.  I think.

One of the benefits to changing would be to use currency units that are relatively intuitive to people in terms of magnitude.  A lot of people have the gut reaction that $200 for a bitcoin is really expensive, but if you tell them it's 500,000 satoshis to the dollar they'd have the opposite gut reaction that satoshis are worthless Zimbabwe money.  Using satoshis would also mean when writing out prices for relatively ordinary things (say in the 1-1000 dollar price range), you'd have to add a bunch of zeros on the end and makes it harder to read and intuit quickly.  It's inefficient to have people counting zeros all the time.  


It would be serviceable until the price goes up by another factor of 1000 or so.  That seems like a reasonable increment by which to update commonly used units.  It's not like this insane growth rate is going to last forever.  Plus, even with the same unit, the exchange rate is always changing so there's a certain amount you have to stay up to date on anyway even if you don't change the unit.

My concern is that regulators will be involved and businesses will *have* to use an address whitelist.
Any business that accepts anonymous cash purchases (which is the vast majority of all brick and mortar retailers) obviously doesn't care who you are or where your money came from, which is why I think the only way this idea is practical is if regulators force it on businesses.  I think these guys are smart enough to know that, thus that's probably their plan.
If there's no regulation involved, then I'd agree with you and think nothing of it because the idea would be dead in the water.  The fact that it's not dead in the water and being actively pursued means these guys are either idiots or they're planning to rely on regulation.  I personally think the latter is more likely.

If you want to help bitcoin, then please stop talking like that. It scares away semi-intelligent people (the truly intelligent won't give a crap what you say).

I honestly don't think it's going to be priced at its "true spending value" for a long time.  There's too much upside for people to not speculate.  If people think it might grow, then the expectation of future growth will inevitably factor into the price.  I also don't think its valued simply for its "spending value" either; there's a store of wealth component that doesn't depend on currency use, much like gold.  There's more to monetary functions than just a medium of exchange.

If you saved those 1913 dollars in your basement vault, they were never replaced 20:1 with 2013 dollars - you have the same amount of dollars as you did then, only they buy 1/20th as much as they did originally.  In your NewDollars analogy, it's like if the government made you trade in your 1 Dollar for 1 NewDollar.
What the "95%" claim doesn't get in to is that our system isn't designed around saving cash under a mattress; most people at the very least will put their money in a savings account and thus accrue interest.  If you did that, you will not lose anywhere near 95% value.  The system is basically designed to more or less force you into investing, since that's essentially what a savings account is - investment socialized to a certain degree.  This has its advantages and its disadvantages - it can help encourage growth but at the cost of increasing systemic risk.  We try to hide the risk through things like FDIC, but really that's just socialized risk.

I understand what you're saying, and if it was up to me then "inflation" would by default refer to monetary inflation, but the mainstream usage of the word these days refers to price inflation.  You can stubbornly refuse to recognize that fact but it's just going to cause problems with communication.  If your goal is to communicate ideas effectively rather than getting in arguments over semantics, then you go with the mainstream usage.  A compromise is to specifically use the terms monetary inflation and price inflation so there's no doubt which you're talking about and you make it clear they are different but related concepts.

I don't think tragedy of the commons applies here because as I said, it's in *the miners* best interest not to get too big, since doing so would threaten the viability of their own service.  If they want to maximize their profit, there will be a sweet spot between "big" and "too big".  It's in their rational self interest to not go beyond that, and we've already seen examples of this in action.

If they didn't suspend trading, the price would have just kept running up since there'd be a lot more people looking to trade dollars for bitcoins (since they're easier to withdraw) than there would be those trading bitcoins for dollars.

I'm just gonna copy/paste my response from a different thread:


There's already no shortage of people who acquired thousands of coins in the early days and regret selling at $2 or $20 or even $200. If it keeps going up, there's going to be more "early adopters" selling at $500, $1000, $5000, whatever. In other words, there's going to be a lot more "early adopters" than you think and the vast majority of them will not be realizing the full gains of the currency's appreciation - they will realize at least a portion of their gains along the way. They will still be "winners", but the gains won't be nearly as concentrated as you might think they would be.
Except for Satoshi. Two decades from now we may be living in the Kingdom of Satoshi, but I think he'd be a benevolent ruler ;)
Also want to add one more thing:


First of all, I *do* think sound money contributes towards more meritable income distribution than the inflationary/debt based system we have now, and second of all, beyond being sound, I don't think it's the job of money to distribute itself properly.  That's society's job.

It doesn't really have anything to do with the exchanges themselves but rather the nature of the banking system in the US along with regulations towards money transmitting.

For those who sincerely have no interest in profiting by holding bitcoins - mark down the purchasing power of your bitcoins at the time you bought them, then whenever they appreciate substantially in value you can donate all the gains you make.  That way you support the bitcoin ecosystem even more by spreading your "wealth" and you can legitimately say you are not interested in making a profit by holding bitcoins.  Put your BTC where your mouth is, in other words.
I personally find nothing wrong with profiting, thus I will not be doing the above (I'll probably do a bit of it actually, but I won't donate *all* my gains in purchasing power).

I totally agree that it incentivizes savings (or hoarding depending on your perspective), but if deflation slows down to a couple percent a year or so you're still going to buy stuff because time is an opportunity cost in itself.  I'll pay a small premium to buy something in a brick and mortar store if it saves me waiting 2 weeks for shipping from an online retailer - expedited shipping exists for the same reason.  Are you just going to put off buying a house forever because you'll be able to buy a nicer house on the day you die?  1% deflation and 100% deflation are completely different animals (same for inflation).  A small amount of deflation does not preclude something from functioning in any way as a currency - these things are not black and white like that.  It's always going to be part investment/part currency and the balance will depend significantly on the rate of deflation.  Saying it has to be one of the other is drawing an unnecessary line - commodities with good monetary qualities (easily transferable, divisible, and storable) have always been a mix of both.
There's already a very real example that we're all intimately familiar with of people buying in the face of severe deflation - *the computer industry*.  You always hear people mulling over whether or not they should wait since the gear gets so much better every year, and it's true that it does, yet they still buy, because otherwise you'll be waiting forever.  If you go by moore's law, the computer industry suffers from the equivalent of roughly 50% annual deflation!  Yet I'm surrounded by computer gear.

IMO that is a critical flaw.  That "guard" against it only works so long as their is confidence in the USD fund.  That confidence will be eaten right through if the market puts significant downward pressure on the price of mastercoin, then you have a bankruptcy/collapse.

Obviously this is all a matter of opinion, and I agree with your assessment in terms of going long, but I think trying to time short term highs and lows is a much bigger crapshoot.  It comes down to whether you think you have an information/analysis advantage versus the market.  In going long, the kind of analysis you're doing is things like betting on general trends and adoption of technology, and you can have an advantage in doing so if you think you are better informed about the things you are investing in and see potential there that has yet to be understood by the larger market.  If you want to try to time the ups and downs of the market, the informational advantage you'd need is of a completely different variety - things like advanced access to news and speed of trading (that's why all those wall street firms pay millions of dollars for the shortest run of cable to exchanges) or the rather voodoo science of trying to predict the tides of human psychology, and you're competing against other bitcoin traders trying to do the same thing.  It comes down to whether or not you think you have an advantage in that game.  I don't think I have an advantage vs other bitcoin traders, but when I see how retarded the greater population is about bitcoin, I definitely think I have an advantage in going long, and that's why I do.
Day trading really is a very different game than going long.

My point is that if the North enslaved the South, they would be doing nothing worse than what the South was already doing.  They would then be equally tyrannical.
If you don't respect liberty, you don't deserve it.  That's the whole point.  I don't give a shit if it's because your tradition doesn't respect liberty - that doesn't make it any more justifiable.  "It's ok if we enslave people because we've always been doing it."  Great argument.  If you're willing to fight for your right to enslave an entire race of people, then I'll hold you responsible for any bloodshed that results from it.  You make it sound like if I kidnap people and chain them in my basement, it's somehow the cops fault if someone gets hurt in the process of freeing those people.  It's not, it's my fault.
It's bizarre to me when supposed libertarians seem to think the right to enslave people carries more weight than the right to not be enslaved.  Talk about cognitive dissonance.  I've said it many times, but you have to respect others liberty if you want yours respected.  That's one of the fundamental concepts of libertarianism, and the reason why it's not a strictly pacifist ideology.

@_date: 2013-04-06 21:25:40
I just want to respond to the proposition that all bitcoins could possibly be lost.  I understand how that seems possible in theory, but a closer examination of how that would actually come about shows that it is improbable to the point of being impossible (or more accurately, any realistic scenario resulting in zero bitcoins would require that bitcoins enter a scenario in which they are already more or less useless, i.e. all being held in one wallet).
First of all, the 8 decimal place limit can, as you mentioned, be updated via a protocol change to allow for as much divisibility as is deemed practical, so for the sake of this argument lets treat bitcoins as being infinitely divisible.
The fact that lost bitcoins can never be recovered means that the supply will ultimately be deflationary, however that does not mean that the supply will ever realistically reach zero.  So long as bitcoins are being what bitcoins are supposed to be, they will be distributed widely across millions or billions of wallets and users around the globe.  Even if, after so many years, all but one bitcoin has been lost, *that* bitcoin will be worth tremendous amounts of money and will be divided across the globe in ever decreasing denominations.  So long as bitcoins are being distributed and transacted widely, there is no realistic scenario where the *last* bitcoin (or whatever small quantity is left at whatever time) will be lost, and really the net quantity of bitcoins is irrelevant (aside from deflationary implications) since it is infinitely divisible.  
Does that make sense?  The only consequence of "lost bitcoins are gone forever" is that the supply is ultimately deflationary.  It does not mean it will ever go to zero, for in order for that to realistically happen, bitcoins would have to first stop being used productively as a currency. In order for the supply to actually go to zero, all active bitcoins in the world would have to more or less be lost simultaneously (highly improbable) or gathered in one place and lost from there, but if all bitcoins are ever gathered in one place then they have long since stopped serving their purpose.  A slow bleed will only result in deflation, and so long as the remaining supply is constantly redistributing (which should happen with a healthy currency), then the risk of it going to zero is practically nil.
TL/DR: bitcoins may asymptotically approach zero, but they will not reach it under any realistic scenario.

I'll take that as a yes.  It's basically analogous to how bitcoin retailers still set their prices in dollars even if they accept bitcoins.  Ideally one day bitcoin stabilizes to the point where that's no longer necessary.

Generally speaking, people will more readily trust someone that is identifiable and thus has a certain reputation at stake as opposed to someone who is anonymous and thus has no reputation to risk.  This isn't an either/or thing; you can build up a reputation with an identity separate from your primary one, for example, but the point is reputation is an enabler for trust, which is the whole point behind seller ratings and whatnot on marketplaces like ebay or silkroad.

By "full retard" I'm simply referring to a market's ability to go from complete exuberance to massive panic in an instant.  I'm glad it corrected a bit when it did and calmed things down a little.  The longer the exuberance went on, the bigger the correction probably would have been (more profit taking).  I'll take relatively stable gains over boom/bust gains any day.

Making it go up is simple - you buy in.
The only way to make it go down is to sell... which you can only do if you buy in.
It's easy to add value to bitcoin, but you can't take away any more than you put in.  You'd have to somehow convince everyone else (including all of us) to sell too.
In short:  raising the price is as easy as buying in with big money.  Dropping to zero is not nearly as simple - you have to resort to manipulative tactics to shake confidence and even that is by no means certain.  The two are not at all equal.

A better way to estimate this (imo) is to simply substitute 21 million bitcoins for various percentages of the world's currency supply.  There's about 20-30 trillion US Dollars worth of physical cash out there currenty; 70-80 trillion if you include electronic deposits and the like.  For a "low" estimate (this is still a very optimistic scenario but we're talking about the low end of "max"), let's take 10% of the physical cash and say that market has now been filled by bitcoin.  That works out to a market cap of ~2.5 trillion dollars for bitcoin, which gives us a price of over $100,000 current US dollars per bitcoin (using the max supply of 21 million bitcoins - the current supply of 11 million would be roughly double that).  For a higher end of the "to the MOON and beyond" scenario, let's take 50% of all currency including electronic deposits (The max is theoretically 100%, but 50% is crazy enough).  That's a market cap of 40 trillion, working out to a price of ~2 million current US dollars per bitcoin.

So if someone leaves their phone behind in a public area, and I pick it up and call the owner offering to return it and he says "whatever, keep it", according to you it sounds like you think I have stolen the phone.  I completely disagree.  Once they showed that private key QR code on public television, that's exactly like leaving your phone behind in a public area.  Anyone who sees it can take it, so if you want the person to not lose it, the best thing you can do is take it yourself and return it.  If they don't even want it back, then you didn't steal it.  That's a pretty bizarre application of morality if you really believe that.
Similarly, if you pick up a lost dog and call the owner to return it, you didn't kidnap the dog.  And please, pick up the dog.  Don't let it just wander the streets out of a misguided sense of morality.

This is an infrastructure problem, not a bitcoin protocol problem.  People who project bitcoin's success do so with the assumption that the infrastructure (and the protocol to a lesser extent) will continue to be developed in practical ways.
Also, transferring bitcoins digitally is stupidly easy.  Transferring NZD digitally, not so much.  That requires using a 3rd party intermediary and they may not approve of how and where you are sending your money, in which case you're shit out of luck.  The ultimate goal of bitcoin is to function in its own closed loop economy, where transferring in and out of other currencies becomes less and less of a necessity.  That would eliminate middle-man obstacles to payment entirely.

Deflation due to productivity growth is not a bad thing.

Gold gets most of its value from being hoarded.  Where can you buy goods with gold?  Practically no where - you just sell it for currency.
And please don't tell me that gold derives its value from its industrial utility.  Its primary utility in the present day world is its monetary store of value function.  People treat it (consciously or not) as a decentralized credit ledger with indisputable proof of ownership - a function that bitcoin could potentially be even better at.  Gold was $2xx an ounce a little over a decade ago - since then it has not become any more useful industrially.  It has only become more useful as a monetary store of wealth.  That's one of bitcoin's functions as well, and it's one that has nothing to do with whether or not it's actually used as a means of exchange.  The fact that it's a good transaction tool is only half of the significance of the protocol - the other half is that it provides indisputable proof of ownership of a scarce commodity.  The former is useful as a means of exchange, but the latter is useful as a store of value.

I agree that it's not some irrefutable proof that a deflationary currency can work, but it does refute imo the argument that a deflationary currency won't work because people won't spend it.

It's a bit complicated, but the general idea is that if you receive bitcoins at an address and then want to send some of those coins somewhere else, the way the transaction is done is that *all* the coins at that address are moved; the amount you wish to send is sent to the desired address, then the wallet software you're using will send the remainder as "change" to yourself at a different address (software wallets are generally a collection of many different addresses and their corresponding private keys).  So say you generate a paper wallet and send 5 BTC to it.  You later decide you'd like to spend 2 BTC from there.  You load up the private key into some wallet software and make your payment of 2 BTC.  The thing to note here is that your paper wallet is now empty - the remaining balance was sent to another address being book kept by the software wallet.  You could then send the remaining balance back to the original paper wallet, but this is generally discouraged because once you send a payment from an address, the address is not quite as secure as one that has never sent a payment before.  That's the reason why the wallet software sends change to a new address as well (also I think to help promote psuedonymity).  
Generally, the way I'd recommend using paper wallets is to generate a good number of them and then deposit into the first.  Then when you want to withdraw some coin from there, you load up the first private key into a software wallet, then send whatever remaining balance you want to keep in cold storage to your 2nd paper wallet, cross out the first, and so on and so forth.  You can modify that appropriately if you'd like to split up your storage among multiple paper wallets, but the general idea stays the same.

I completely agree that holding money that was previously stolen is not a crime.  I also think you should be allowed to "plead the 5th" regarding questions about where it came from, if you so choose.  I'd also be happy to answer the question (unless I had some overriding privacy concern) if I thought it might help.  I'm ok with helping to fight theft, fraud, and extortion.  I don't include those things in personal liberty, and think society is better off with less of them.  That said, your cooperation must be voluntary.  I am firm on that.
It's also worth noting that this generally wouldn't come up for transactions involving "victimless crimes" like drugs or prostitution or tax evasion.  Those transactions are mutually beneficial and neither party wants to draw attention to them.  This would only come up when one party felt legitimately robbed.

Let's go hypothetical then - the year is 2140, bitcoin has taken over the world as its sole currency, and the final satoshi has just been mined - no more bitcoins will ever be brought into existence.  Is bitcoin still deflationary in this scenario?  Well, it depends.  Is the economy growing?  If so, yes, it will be deflationary roughly proportionally to growth (over the long term at least).  Is the economy stagnant?  If so, bitcoin will be roughly stable in value.  Is the economy shrinking?  If so, bitcoins will be depreciating in value (price inflation).  
What does this all mean for the loan and credit industry?  In all of these scenarios, loans will only be profitable if the expected value created by the loan *exceeds* the background rate of growth (or contraction) of the economy.  I think the shrinking and stagnant economy examples are pretty self-explanatory, as that would result in either a stable or inflationary currency (pretty similar to what we have now) and there's plenty of incentive to loan in that environment, so let's focus on the growth (deflationary) scenario - that's the doozy, after all.
Let's say the background growth rate is 2% per year, so bitcoins are increasing in purchasing power by 2% yearly as well.  The worry now is that there's no incentive to give out a loan that would have an expected value creation equivalent to, say, 1% growth (there's still an incentive for loans expected to create greater than 2% growth, as those could still pay a positive nominal interest rate).  And that's true, there wouldn't be an incentive to give out a 1% real growth (resulting in a -1% nominal rate) loan, because in nominal terms, that'd pay back less btc's then you loaned out, so of course it's wiser to simply hold on to the btc rather than loan it out.  But I'd ask - why should there be an incentive to do that??  The background growth rate is 2% per year!  That 2% doesn't just come from nowhere, it's the result of an economy built upon all the uses (saving, spending, and profitable loaning) of all the currency in the world - the currency is an essential part of the economy obviously, and that economy is apparently creating 2% growth per year.  Why would you want to re-direct any portion of the currency towards a use that's only expected to grow value by 1%?  That's suboptimal for the economy as a whole - it actually *slows down* the rate of growth.  The trick here - *and this is the crux of the argument, the part that I'm arguing most people miss* - is that you have to understand that even if the money is just sitting there not being spent, *saving* is an integral part of the function of any economy.  All the actions of money, whether it's being spent, loaned, or sitting in savings, play their part in creating the economy as it is.  How does saving affect the economy?  For one, it passively increases the purchasing power for the rest of the money in circulation - you know, the economic activity that's generating 2% growth.  If you loan it out, it's now competing for goods and services and has a small but real inflationary effect.  It also affects the mind of the saver - their behavior most certainly depends on the amount of savings they have.  Again, if background growth is 2%, then a loan that results in 1% real growth is a (relatively) destructive use of the currency that will ultimately slow the economy down (again relative to 2%), because you're taking that money away from it's role in a 2% growth economy (a role which includes affecting the mentality and decisions of savers while passively increasing the purchasing power of circulating money) in order to create 1% growth.  That is a relative loss.
This is a well balanced, self-corrective system that only incentivizes loans if they're expected to generate more value than the currency would if otherwise left serving its role in the greater economy.  Whether that role is to be spent, loaned at a profitable rate, or saved, *all* those uses contribute to where the background growth rate of the economy comes from.  We seem to have a knee jerk reaction to this of, "but, what about THE LOANS??", but I'd counter that this is exactly as the system should be, and it's how you'd want to incentivize everything to maximize healthy, sustainable growth!  The key is to realize that savings *are* an active contributor to an economy, even if the money is just sitting there "doing nothing".  It's not actually doing nothing, it's passively contributing to the purchasing power of "productive" currency, and also giving security and potentiality to the saver.  This is the critical thing that modern economics overlooks, and why we're taught that fixed currency supplies and their deflationary consequences won't work.  Idle savings are looked at as a waste that do not contribute to an economy.  That's false, although I can certainly understand why it's easy to think it's true - the effect manifests itself in both human psychology and passive effects on purchasing power of circulating money, which are subtle but most definitely real forces in the economy.

If all the powers that be wanted to drive bitcoin to zero, they could very well come up with some nefarious tactics to do so.  The comment I was replying to was one that implied that if someone (Max Keiser and his funds) can drive the price up, then it's just as trivial to drive the price down.  That's what I was disputing - down to zero is not trivial, up is.  They aren't equal in that respect.  That's the premise I was responding to.  Max Keiser doesn't need to do anything other than buy in to make the price go up - that's stupid easy to do if you have the money; no manipulative tactics needed.

It's not that it's 100% fake money or some retarded extreme like that, it's just money that has a higher risk premium than cash at other exchanges due to the liquidity challenges.

Also, just because mtgox hits some number, it's not a guarantee that the other exchanges will - if we hit a mini peak and a correction, the peak at mtgox will be about 5-10% higher than most other exchanges if current relationships hold.

Then everyone on this sub goes nuts buying cheap bitcoins and drives the price back up.  The government loses a bunch of money.  We profit, and the price does not end up at zero.
The point still stands that driving the price up is trivial (you buy) while driving it down is not - you have to rely on short term price shocks to ultimately shake confidence and other gimmicky tactics to try to turn *everyone* off from bitcoin.  That is a very different ballgame than simply buying in and raising prices.

Bitcoin is a relatively technically complicated and abstract concept, and I'd venture that the majority of people who have heard about it don't properly understand it.  Hell, most of the people reporting on it, and thus doing the job of informing the masses, don't properly understand it.  If you don't really understand it, it can sound awfully ponzi/scammy, and if some "experts" on tv re-iterate those beliefs then thats what most people are going to go with.  And even if you do understand it, central to the idea is the abstractness of what "money" really is, and that's a concept most people have never really thought about and find the true answer very unintuitive.  
Bitcoin is a pretty new and revolutionary concept, it's going to take a while for the masses to learn what it actually is.  Not everyone cares enough or has the technical ability to learn about it themselves.  When they see these reports about crazy returns and they don't really understand why those returns are happening, they're going to assume it's a scam or bubble or whatever you want to call it.  It's just going to take time, nothing wrong with that.  Bitcoin needs time to mature anyway.

I dunno, I consider myself as big a bitcoin bull as any, but I think our current monetary system is ready to implode at any moment and I'm not sure bitcoin will be mature enough to take the reigns.  There are still very real scaling issues that need to be addressed with bitcoin, and there's no guarantee they can be addressed as soon as a year or two out (although I am quite confident that addressing them *is* ultimately only a matter of time, and will eventually be done).  I think it'll likely take a decade or so for the bitcoin ecosystem to be mature enough to reach the kind of potential I imagine for it.  If our current monetary system fails before then, the world could turn to gold to provide the secure monetary anchor the world economy would demand, and that would be the type of event that would probably be quite a windfall for physical gold holders.  I would still think a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin would do quite well during such an event as well, and would ultimately be the future, but I guess all I'm saying is I can still see fairly plausible scenarios that could be very rewarding for gold - at least in the near term of a decade or so.  Perception and confidence play a huge part in the evaluation of money, particularly among those with a lot to lose - i.e. the richest of the rich, and bitcoin still has a long ways to go in that respect.  Gold has the history of all modern civilization behind it, and it's going to take bitcoin a bit of time to build the kind of confidence required to challenge it.  The question is whether our current monetary system will grant it that time, or whether a global solution will be demanded before it's quite ready - in which case I think gold could very well play an important role.

Your expected value using Martingale is still negative no matter how little you play.  You have a high probability of winning a tiny amount of money and a low probability of losing a shit ton.  If you multiply the probability of those outcomes by their associated gains/losses (this is how you calculate expected value) it always comes out negative since the odds are fundamentally against you.  The probability that you lose multiplied by the amount you would lose will be bigger than the probability you win multiplied by the amount you would win.

There was a point where OKCoin (Chinese exchange) had 36% higher BTC prices than btc-e.  Both exchanges also trade litecoin.  Guess what the LTC price difference was?
36%.  
Any arbitrage capability of litecoin gets completely overwhelmed by BTC due to the fact that it takes ~30-40 LTC to arb one BTC (even after the current price surge of LTC).  At that point, they both suffer from the same liquidity issues that cause the arb opportunity in the first place - fiat liquidity.

When purchasing a computer, you face the question - do I want to buy a computer today, or wait until some time in the future when I'll be able to buy a better computer (i.e. "more computer") with the same amount of money.
Are you ok with this as well?

Of course they can do what they want, but if they think they can stop the pricefinding of BTC then that's obviously false.

So you're saying it *won't* go transdimensional?  HOW DO YOU KNOW??
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:16:13
I was curious a few days ago so I crunched some numbers.  Assuming, say, a population of 90 billion people with 1 million addresses each, for a total of 90 quadrillion addresses, the odds of there being *any* overlap amongst those addresses is 1.2e-31.  That's a ridiculously strong zero with plenty of room for growth.  The key of course is a good source of randomness, but that goes for no matter how large your key space is.
The [birthday paradox]( never really becomes a factor because you never advance beyond the first infinitesimally small increment on that curve.  For example, the first point on the chart represents 2 people out of 365, or a fraction of 2/365.  The fraction of 9e16 bitcoin addresses (90 quadrillion) to the total keyspace (2^160) is 6e-32.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:32:15
Because before the $260 bubble popped, the $33 bubble did.  You have a short memory!
But really, none of these reasons.  It depends on if you think bitcoin is viable as a combination money/store of value/payment network.  If you think it is, the upside is still ridiculous - we seriously haven't even scratched the surface yet.  The downside if it fails is possible loss of principle.  Estimate the odds and outcomes, use that to estimate an expected return, and if it's positive then pick an amount to invest according to your risk tolerance.  It's simple really.

IMO the great thing about bitcoin is that you can be your own bank *if you want to*.  Options.  Banks are mainly problematic because we more or less have to use them, so there's no market accountability of the system as a whole.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:12:45
Like I said, I don't think bitcoin is destroyable.  The most they could do is force it into a niche.  If it does become obsolete, it won't be because it was "destroyed" by the powers that be but rather because it was replaced by some other decentralized blockchain based crypto.  Anything issued or controlled by a central bank does not qualify for that imo.  No doubt a centralized solution could be pushed out and used for a long time, but I think the decentralized solution will eventually win, it's just a matter of how long "eventually" takes.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:18:55
Why can't bitcoin start out as primarily an investment vehicle (thus getting people to "adopt" it so to speak) then transition to being primarily a currency once the value starts to stabalize?
It doesn't have to be entirely one or the other, and its primary purpose can change over time.

They are not identical, we established that.  I don't think it's supposed to be a direct reference, but it definitely looks inspired by it to me.  I find this bizarre that you think these are clearly independent, especially considering the timing, but oh well.  There's an infinite number of ways that they could have chosen to draw that up - if it was truly independent it probably would have looked completely different.
Basically, there are enough similarities that it seems more likely to me that the explanation is inspiration rather than mere coincidence.

Yes.  The current protocol allows for decimation up to 8 decimal places, and .00000001 BTC is generally referred to as a "Satoshi".  That can be updated via a future protocol update, but the need for that is still a long ways away :)
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:58:04
Did anyone ever doubt that governments would try whatever they can to regulate bitcoin?  No.  Is it surprising that businesses who want to remain on the legal up and up are looking into ways they can co-operate with that desire?  No.  Not everyone wants to be a sacrificial martyr to the state - some just want to make a living.  I don't see how the way things are unfolding would be viewed as unexpected or surprising in any way.  It strikes me as rather predictable.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:34:04
If there was a real need for it (i.e. 1 satoshi is worth 5 current US dollars or something) then there'd be plenty of motivation for everyone to do it.
@_date: 2013-10-25 06:37:20
It's not at all like bitcoin though as it's US Dollar based.  I'm honestly not surprised (why would anyone be really?) that they don't want to draw the ire of the anti-bitcoin world (mainly the banking industry and US government).  What they're doing is only a payment system, not a currency itself or a store of value.  Won't make too many enemies.
But I guess since they aren't joining our hype train we need to get angry at them.  rawr.
Just to be clear, I don't think it's going to be particularly successful, I'm just not surprised at all that they don't want to piss off their overlords.  It's easy to play armchair CEO when you don't have anything to lose.
@_date: 2013-12-26 10:51:06
A block includes the hash of the previous block, so if he "didn't know about the first block" and found a valid hash at almost the exact same time, then his block would actually be a competing block.  In that case, miners would work on whichever block they received first, and you'd have two blockchains temporarily competing, but as long as there's a clear winner between the two for the next block then the chain will re-sync and the losing block will be orphaned and thus invalid.
@_date: 2013-10-25 20:24:23
I see. 
Well that definitely sounds doable, but that means it's not going to be able to get bigger than bitcoin without running into the same fiat-exchange issues.
Anyways, thanks for the answer.
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:51:40
But if you believe bitcoins are overall a good proposition (which I do; I think it's high risk but even higher potential reward), then why would your advice ever change from simply "sure, buy what you're willing to lose"?  Obviously I don't think asking random strangers for advice is the wisest thing to do, but that's my honest advice - it's what I do myself.  I can't time the market, I don't know when we're about to have a correction or a further rally, so why would I try to make any distinction over whether now is the right time or later is?  Saying "it's at a high so now's not the right time" is just as much based on the flawed assumption that you can time the market as any other timing based recommendation.  
The bottom line is, do I think bitcoins are a good buy?  Yes I do, so long as you manage your risk appropriately.  Timing is irrelevant because *I can't time the market*.  People seem to throw that basic logic out the window when the market is at a high - then it's somehow obvious that it's a bad time.  That's not how it works.  The whole "buy high, sell low" advise rests on the fundamental assumption that you're dealing with a market that oscillates around a relatively fixed range.  That's not bitcoin (or most markets, really, which is why it's not very useful advice in practice).

It'll be interesting to see though how the bubbles evolve with every iteration.  The First Great Bitcoin Bubble of 2011^^TM saw a massive sell off after it popped, pretty much completely wiping out the recent gains as everyone probably thought "oh, I guess this is the end, better get out while I can!"  Of course, history has shown that it wasn't in fact the end, and bitcoin came back even stronger!  Then when The Second Great Bitcoin Bubble of 2013^^TM came around, you saw the same ferocious panic selling directly after the peak as everyone thought, "HERE WE GO AGAIN", but this time around we also saw the price recover a bit and stabalize at around ~30% of the peak - which is still a massive pop, but the sell off didn't last nearly as long and the price didn't fall nearly as far as it did the first time around.  I think it's pretty clear people had gained confidence from the fact that bitcoin survived the First Great Bubble and came back even stronger, thus many were probably eagerly waiting to "buy the dip" the second time around.  
I suspect that with every iteration of the bubble, there will be more people willing to sell a bit if the price is rising too rapidly (in anticipation of the upcoming pop), more people hesitant to buy in too eagerly if the price has already run up significantly (again in anticipation of the upcoming pop), and more people eagerly waiting to buy the dip if it *does* pop - all those factors put together would work to stabilize the price a bit and mitigate the size of the bubbles.  That progression is already visible from the first bubble to the second - if you look at a [log chart]( the amplitude of the second bubble is less than the first (and a log chart is the proper way to look at this).  I like to think of it as the market learning :)  We've been living with government managed fiat for so long that we've become slightly retarded when it comes to dealing with an unregulated currency, but bitcoin's giving everyone a crash course.  Experience is a very effective teacher.

Yes.  Precisely that.  You only move on to a new currency if there are significant advantages warranting the transition - otherwise it's more convenient and efficient for us to all share a common currency.  Bitcoin has advantages over our current currencies.  A bitcoin clone would not have any advantages over bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-11-01 19:50:33

The fact that the founder is anonymous is considered dirt in itself by some people.
If the revelation that bitcoin was created by a mathematical genius is indeed true then I'd consider that a positive for bitcoin.  Better than the suspicion that it's a hacker trying to rip people off or a CIA blackops thing or whatever the hell some people theorize.

I'll take that as a no.
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:03:37
Of course not.  Now find a way for people to not be influenced by power and you might be able to fix it.  Unfortunately laws generally do a poor job of actually making that happen.  Corruption is an insidious problem for that reason.  Legislation will find a way to be bought regardless of what the law says.
The only realistic "solution" imo (and it's not a utopia by any means, but the best I think we can do) is people insisting on decentralized power, but of course that takes human initiative which you can't just conjure out of thin air either.

What's your point?  Are you implying that selling/brewing beer is immoral because it has some harmful effects?  Because I'm pretty sure that's *not* what DPR was saying there (hence the "PROUD" bit), but rather it's the user's responsibility to use responsibly, and that selling something with "harmful effects" is in no way immoral (unless you're lying or deceiving people about the effects, in which case I would classify that as immoral, but deception/fraud is a different issue entirely).
If you'd answer the beer question I'd have a better idea where you stand.  Your point is one that cannot be applied consistently otherwise society would be a genuine nightmare where producing much of anything would be considered immoral.  Videogames?  Can be addicting and ruin your life, immoral.  A bike?  You could hurt yourself, immoral.  Cars?  How many people die every year due to those things? IMMORAL.  Alcohol... oh man.

You're *really* making that argument?  In Either you're new here or this is satire...
How much is a satoshi worth these days?  And more importantly, why do we care about arbitrary units??  The only meaningful number for a crypto is its market cap - everything else is completely arbitrary.
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:09:14
I actually brought that up as a hypothetical when it happened.  I don't think it's a good idea simply because it might give the government the incentive to wage a full on regulatory war, which would probably be a losing proposition for everyone.
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:04:39
I haven't looked into it at all, but a simple question would be "where do the returns come from"?  If it comes from other people buying in (or misleadingly payed out to you from your own initial principal) then that's a ponzi scheme.  There's no way to "double" your money (or increase it by any % really) without successfully investing it in a productive enterprise and that's never risk free.
*edit* - so I just looked into it and it's basically putting your money into a managed investment fund (like a mutual fund) except you get fixed bond-style payouts rather than returns that fluctuate with the fund's performance (at least that's how it's described).  This may seem "less risky" but ultimately you're depending on the issuer to make you whole if the investments end up going south, and if the investments are wildly profitable you won't see any of the additional returns beyond your fixed rate.  This is by no means risk free in design, which is rather obvious considering there's no such thing as risk free returns unless you count nominal returns from a currency issuer (like US bonds).  But nominal ain't real (and as we've witnessed recently, even currency issuers can flirt with defaulting on debt denominated in their own printable currency).
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:06:17
Dig around in the settings/options, you can set the transfer fee yourself.  The default is dated, thus the surprisingly high amount.  The higher your transfer fee, the higher priority your transaction will be for confirmation, so if you pay zero transaction fees it might take a long time to confirm or even never.
Try .0002 BTC (~5 cents).  You can probably get away with less if you really care.
@_date: 2013-10-15 06:00:47
Sort of, but there is a counterbalancing force in that it's in the miners' best interest to not make that vulnerability a reality, since raising those sorts of doubts could negatively impact the value of bitcoin and push people towards other cryptos.  If people start thinking mining is getting too concentrated, it'll be in the best interest of the miners themselves to decentralize a bit.  We've already seen some of that self-limitation with btc guild.  There's no point in growing bigger and bigger if doing so basically ruins your product in the process. 
Satoshi is a clever motherfucker.

It's just an exchange rate.  There's no such thing as "too expensive".  If you have 5 dollars and BTC is trading at $1000, then you buy .005 BTC.  If BTC is trading at $1, then you buy 5 BTC.  In both cases, you have roughly enough BTC to buy a Big Mac.  Who cares where the decimal place is?  It's a Big Mac regardless of what the exchange rate is.
Once you hold BTC however, it does make a difference to you whether the supply inflates or not, since that directly affects the preservation of your purchasing power.
@_date: 2013-10-26 16:01:22
I'm pretty sure Satoshi chose the "mining" analogy for a reason. Bitcoins are similar to gold in that there's no central authority that can monopolize seignorage and "manage" the supply.  They are both distinctly Austrian currencies in their deflationary and decentralized nature, and they invite many of  the same criticisms from much of the modern monetary crowd. 
Of course, they're very different as well, but in that one key area of economic theory (probably the most controversial aspect of bitcoin) they are aligned.

That's... that's not the same thing *at all*.  If I hold one bitcoin and the supply gets inflated by "printing" more bitcoins (theoretically speaking of course as that's not how bitcoins actually work), my fraction of the total pie is now smaller.  If I hold one bitcoin and the units of subdivision get smaller, I still have the same fraction of the total pie, and my one bitcoin relative to those smaller subdivisions is now larger.

If the transaction was initiated, then yeah, it should show up as pending in the blockchain info for your address.  The problem with gox though is (I think, I don't deal with them) that transactions themselves are being delayed on their end.  As far as them telling you, you could ask, but I'd think they aren't supposed to divulge that info to people other than the account holder.
Since he's not responding though, I'd probably go ahead and move forward assuming it's a scam.

A wholesale exodus of people buying coins would drive the price up, not down.
There's a giant sell wall at 267 on gox for some reason.  I have no idea why someone would do that, but that's why the price is stuck there.  Bitcoinity isn't showing many trades going through either so who knows what's going on really.

The good news for bitcoin is you guys are now showing up when the price dips into the *90's* :)  Just a couple years ago the doomers were piping up about dips into the [single digits](  The fact that they're now harping on prices in the 90's is pretty hilarious.  Whatever helps you rationalize things I guess :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 12:28:27
Yeah, but given the volatility of bitcoin, it seems silly to judge your decision *18 days later*.  The people who bought in at the peak of the last bubble (~260) have still more than doubled their money in just 8 months.  Did they make a bad decision?  Only if you think it's realistic to be able to time short term highs and lows, which I personally don't think any average investor should expect to be able to do.  I don't think I've ever made an investment intending to hold for less than a year, much less 18 days.

My thoughts:  This is what bitcoin does.  2 steps forward, 1 step back.  10 steps forward, 6 steps back.  Considering it was ~$150 a month ago, I'd say it's been a pretty amazing month.  If this is the "crash", then so far it's a lot tamer than the one back in April!

I'm guess I'm not totally clear on what "right" and "wrong" mean to you... are you saying that sometimes the wrong thing (murder) is the right choice to make?

The very fact that such a large arbitrage opportunity exists proves that it's very difficult to actually receive the USD price at mtgox or the Chinese exchanges.  If it was possible to actually receive USD reliably in those amounts then the arb opportunity would close up in a flash.  So while you're right that the higher value is representative of the value of BTC *in China*, if you just convert the Yuan value to Dollars then you're quoting a price that most people in Dollar economies can't actually receive.  What good is a price if you can't take advantage of it?
I'd still rather quote prices that people can realistically expect to get.  If you want to trade your BTC for Dollars, then that price is the one on exchanges like bitstamp/coinbase.

Fellow lazy guy here.  Heard about bitcoins pretty early; thought the concept was brilliant and eventually tried to buy 500 bitcoins or so when they were 2 bucks each... got about half way through the process then got fed up with whatever hoops I had to jump through to get the money transferred (forgot what exactly those hoops were but they were enough to deter my lazy ass).

Volatility will either feed more or less people depending on its direction, and for the most part the direction so far has been overwhelmingly positive.  Without the significant boost to purchasing power he's received so far by using bitcoins, substantially less people would have been fed.

Banks can certainly serve a role even with bitcoin, although I'd like it if they made it clear that fractional reserve banking is investing, not saving.  The lack of FDIC should make that more transparent.  You could also have "vault" type banks that simply store your bitcoins for you with 100% reserves and regular audits.  That's basically like a safety deposit box - you pay them to hold something securely for you.  You don't have to use them obviously, but some people may want to.
Central banking, however, is what bitcoin truly threatens.  Are you sure *you* understand the true nature of bitcoin?

I personally think Bernanke is just an academic doing his best to keep the economy from collapsing.  I also think his experience has finally brought him around to the conclusion that the dollar is fucked, but obviously he can't just come out and say that. 
He was given an impossible job - prevent the inevitable collapse of a massive credit bubble.  If he didn't do anything to stop it, he would have been blamed.  He kicked the can for as long as he possibly can, and now he's getting the fuck out of dodge before it crumbles.  I honestly don't think he particularly cares much about bitcoin and its threat to banking.  He's at heart an academic more than a banker.  I'd remind people that his career prior to the federal reserve was as a professor at Princeton.

IMO, this is what I expected it to be from the moment I learned about it.  Revolutionary technologies don't just quietly sit in the corner growing slowly and steadily.  If bitcoin replaces 10% of the world's *physical* currency (nevermind electronic deposits and whatnot), you're looking at a price per bitcoin of well over 100,000 current US Dollars.  If you believe in the technology, then that isn't a crazy scenario at all, and there's substantial potential even further above and beyond that.

Predicting short term rises and drops is, imo, a fools game (all the more power to those who can make it work though).  My longterm outlook is that bitcoin's potential valuation will steady in the 10k - 1 million current US dollar range, so I obviously think it's still severely undervalued.  The biggest risk imo is governments attempting to squash it due to the existential threat it poses to central banking (you don't just pull that kind of valuation out of thin air, and in this case central banking will pay the price for bitcoins rise).  Whether or not attempts to squash it would ultimately be succesful is hard to say, but it would certainly put some brakes on the whole experiment.

I'm familiar with the game, and I'm not at all trying to say that they put Cartman in a wizard costume because of the bitcoin ad.  If someone suggested that, I'd think they're an idiot.  I'm not suggesting it.  I'm talking about overall similarities in the flyer/ad, from the layout to the phrase parsing to the artistic style.
I feel like you're underestimating how unlikely it is that all those similarities exist without one being either consciously or subconsciously inspired by the other.  You could look all over the internet and you won't find another picture that looks nearly as alike (as a whole, including style and location of text) to those two as they do to each other.  Taking that into consideration, it seems like a more plausible explanation that the south park artist saw the ad and it either consciously or subconsciously influenced his drawing of the flyer.  That to me seems orders of magnitude more likely than it being a pure coincidence, especially when you account for the fact that it was drawn right around the time the ad was most visible and popular.  It'd be as simple as the artist seeing it, saying, "hey, I like that, I should draw this Cartman wizard flyer in a similar manner".  That's all.

The hell?  Am I not understanding it correctly or does that not make any sense?
There has to be an interface somewhere where *actual dollars* are exchanged for mastercoins - that's the point of an exchange.  The problem is the traditional banking system's control and restrictions over where and how you can send dollars, outside of cash of course.  So the question is, where and how do I send dollars to be exchanged for mastercoins?
What am I missing here?  Of course, you sound skeptical yourself so you don't need to answer this.

You could try blockchain as well.  They only store encrypted files on their servers and all decryption/encryption is done client side in your browser so they never have the ability to see your private keys.  That way even if they get hacked, the information to decrypt the files isn't there.  The only vulnerability would be if someone replaced the javascript that loads from the site with some malicious code, but you can pretty much eliminate that risk by using the chrome/firefox extensions that save all the client side code locally.  They'll also send you encrypted backups of your wallet so you could just straight upload those to dropbox.  It's a pretty good combination of web convenience and security.  You're still vulnerable to stuff like keylogger attacks but that goes for everything but well executed cold storage.  You're at least protected from companies running off with your money or getting their servers hacked.

That feature is designed precisely to allow secure 3rd party private key generation.

Yuan-Dollar is an illiquid trade.  That's why converting the Chinese yuan price to Dollars is a bit misleading.  Goxbux-Dollar illiquidity is the reason why the mtgox price is misleading, and yuan-Dollar illiquidity is why the Yuan price converted to dollars is misleading.  If you actually want to get dollars for your bitcoins, then places like bitstamp are still where you go, which is why I consider their price more reflective of reality.

I agree with the torture bit being wrong, but I honestly don't think the murder part is wrong.  If you threaten to ruin thousands of lives in order to extract a ransom, you're taking on the risk of retaliation fair and square.  That falls under an ethical use of self defense in my book, because unfortunately the business they're dealing with does not allow them to go to the police or use the court system (which is another problem with prohibition, but I digress).  If you'd like to retain your right to not be murdered, then simply don't extort people for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

How many people are using it today, and even among those people how many actually have any substantial wealth in bitcoin rather that just some speculative gambling money?
If bitcoin actually succeeds in being what it's trying to be (a deflationary store of wealth and currency similar to gold, minus gold standard shenanigans) then valuations of a million dollars per bitcoin are *expected*.  That's the market cap required to serve that function.  I realize that sounds crazy, but at the same time it's a simple calculation.  I don't reject things just because they "sound" unreasonable, but I will approach them with caution since they obviously would require some dynamic change to become a reality, but that in itself is not a reason to reject it as a possibility.
There are two ways to value bitcoin - one is, "This is what it is now, and it can go higher but not that much higher".  IMO, that is a valuation based on pure ignorance with the excuse of "being reasonable".
The other way is to project what type of role bitcoin could potentially fill in the economy then calculate values based on that.  That's where valuations over 100k become very easy to see.  I'm not saying it's going to happen, because I can't say for sure that bitcoin will succeed.  There are numerous scaling issues, regulatory challenges, and public perception obstacles that need to be overcome.  But if it does, it'd be hard to see a scenario where you don't approach and exceed 100k.  If it becomes wildly successful and becomes the de facto standard for global wealth allocation, then it's well over a million.  And I do think that's a possibility, since I think the demand/need for such a thing is actually there, we've just never had anything to fill that role as well as bitcoin potentially could - the closest thing we've ever had is gold, and currently the best thing we have is the US bond market (a situation that is most probably *not* going to last forever, and we might even see a major shift in this area in the near future - what comes next?).  Never in the history of the world have we had anything with the properties of bitcoin - a highly liquid global credit ledger that is *not* dependent on trust in a central authority.  That's huge!  It combines the convenience and liquidity of digital fiat with the "no central authority/reliable scarcity" aspect of gold.  That's an unprecedented development in monetary history.
That's why so many people refer to bitcoin as a "binary investment".  It's either going to the moon or crashing to a low (but probably not zero imo) value.  And the moon isn't 10k, it's much higher than that.  
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:39:58
Knowledge and hard work are both valuable tools in navigating this world.    In times of rapid change like we live in now, however, you're right that knowledge probably has a distinct edge.

Is "pricing in" really the right term here?  For example, if I thought 1 bitcoin would be worth 10k in 10 years, is 1k a fair price for it currently?  Wouldn't you be willing to pay more?  A 10x return over 10 years is absurdly high, and if that was the expectation the price would in fact be higher (much closer to 10k already) with a much more modest return.  I don't think "risk" is a valid explanation either because risk should factor into the expected value.
It looks to me like the chart is saying that the 1000 estimate (1% in 10 years) would be pricing in 1/10th of 1% of those asset classes.
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:22:41
The problem with our current system is we've mixed secure storage of your money (vaulting services) with investment (modern day banking).
You talk about a "contractual guarantee of security for bitcoins", but if you're talking about the same bank loaning out bitcoins (is that what you meant?) presumably with your money, that guarantee is only as good as the bank's solvency.
Storage is in itself a service; you should expect to pay a small fee for the bank to securely store your money and *not* lend it out.  Also known as vaulting.  Investment (having your savings loaned out) is another animal and should be treated separately.  In that case, it's more reflective of reality to look at it as if you're buying a bank bond.  You put your money at risk in order to generate a return.  No risk, no return.

That's most definitely *not* my desire.  What I'm talking about would be either a version of the bitcoin client or an add-on to wallet software that people can choose to run that would implement some sort of feature similar to putting up a serial number for stolen goods and asking people to send me info if they come across them, in the hopes that it will help me prosecute theft.


I have no response to this because it's a completely gross exaggeration of what I was suggesting.  I'm 100% for voluntary cooperation.  If you don't want to participate, that's fine.  And if a government institution or something like that tries to institute this, I'll definitely boycott it because I don't like the structure.  All I'm saying is I don't think the concept of using serial numbers to help fight theft is in itself bad, and it could be used to help minimize the profitability of things like cryptolocker.  I'm happy to voluntarily contribute to limiting the profitability of ventures like that, since they are destructive to the productivity of society.
It must still be a decentralized, user controlled system.  But such a thing is possible, and I think potentially helpful.

All your dollars can be converted to BTC if you want.  If you think it's worth spending Dollars on something, then that's not really any different than thinking it's worth spending BTC on it, since you could spend your Dollars on BTC as well.
Basically your options with *all* of your money, whether it's BTC or Dollars are:
1. Save some (or all) as BTC
2. Save some (or all) as Dollars
3. Spend it in either.
If you're gonna spend, then spending in BTC is nice because it supports the development of the BTC economy, which collectively boosts the value of BTC in return.  And like mentioned, if you want to maintain a certain portion of your savings in BTC, then just convert some Dollars to replenish it.  Doing it this way slowly shifts value from the Dollar economy to the BTC economy.

I don't necessarily disagree (I firmly believe slavery would have died off on its own eventually), but the part that confuses me is the fact that those fighting to protect their right to deny liberty to others are somehow considered the ones less responsible for the whole mess.  It's like you don't view them as the aggressors because they were aggressing on their own people, who of course were not viewed as people.  I disagree with the assessment - they were people, and they were being denied their liberty in the most cruel way.  Defending slavery imo is a blatant act of immoral aggression. 
Slave owners were not just "minding their own business" - they were actively enslaving people.  That, imo, is the initiation of aggression, and one that warrants an aggressive response.

In fact, I was talking it up long before I ever actually bought any because I thought it was a pretty genius application of various technologies with a very real potential to disrupt the state of our current monetary order.  You have the cause and effect backwards.

The connection is actually pretty simple - in general, increasing the money supply (monetary inflation) leads to rising prices of goods (price inflation).  Now there are a lot of other factors that can affect price inflation as well, so the connection is by no means perfect, but there's definitely a strong conceptual link there.

I think there's a strong libertarian argument for a form of UBI funded by natural resource revenue.  I strongly believe everyone should own 100% of the value they produce (i.e. no wealth redistribution), but no one produces natural resources.  The most they can do is add value to them.  The added value should be theirs, but it doesn't make any sense that the rights to the raw natural resources can be "owned" by people in perpetuity.  A better system to manage resource rights would be to auction off rights to natural resources for given periods of time, and split that revenue equally among everyone as a form of "UBI" (since, again, none of us can take credit for the creation of natural resources, therefore the most reasonable thing to do is share it equally).  
It's basically the modern version of the right to "live off the land".  I don't think it's moral to have people born into a world where they have to purchase the right from those who were there first to simply live off of what nature provides on its own.  There was that "you didn't build that" meme started by Obama back when, and I get the opposition to that idea when talking about businesses and whatnot, but when talking about natural resources, I think we can all agree that *we didn't build that*.  No one did.  When it comes to those resources, I think an equal split of the value is a much more valid and morally defensible system than "first to claim it owns rights forever", which is essentially what our current system derived from.

Bitcoin is not going to reach its full potential overnight.  It's going to take many years, maybe even decades.  Along the way, there will be "early adopters" that cash out and others that buy in.  Very few people are going to be holding all the coins they mined back in 2009 all the way through a rally that could last on and off for decades.
There's already no shortage of people who acquired thousands of coins in the early days and regret selling at $2 or $20 or even $200.  If it keeps going up, there's going to be more "early adopters" selling at $500, $1000, $5000, whatever.  In other words, there's going to be a lot more "early adopters" than you think and the vast majority of them will not be realizing the full gains of the currency's appreciation - they will realize at least a portion of their gains along the way.  They will still be "winners", but the gains won't be nearly as concentrated as you might think they would be.
Except for Satoshi.  Two decades from now we may be living in the Kingdom of Satoshi, but I think he'd be a benevolent ruler ;)

What's the point in saving and never spending?  Just pass it on to your children?  And they'll never spend it and pass it on to their children?

I think his point is that we have the liberty to ask people to voluntarily help track down a thief, and they have the liberty to do so if they wish.  This wouldn't affect things like the drug trade where it's a mutually beneficial transaction.  It would only come up if one party felt they were robbed.  It's like publicly broadcasting the serial number of some stolen property and asking people to notify you if they come across it so you can hopefully track down the thief.
As long as it's a voluntary service that people can choose to run or not then I consider that well within our liberty.  It's also important to make it perfectly clear that simply holding money that was previously flagged for something is not a crime.
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:23:28
Sure, and that's a completely different animal compared to raising the price by simply buying in.  Doing that is trivial if you have the money, which is why I objected to the original statement that implied that dropping to zero was just as easy as raising the price.
My original reply should be taken in context with the post I was replying to.  I don't mean to say it's *impossible* to drive it to zero, but rather it is not equivalently trivial as it is to raise the price.

The price per bitcoin is completely an arbitrary result of where Satoshi decided to place a decimal point.  It could be $8 million per bitcoin or 8 cents per bitcoin right now depending on where he decided to place that decimal point.  If you want to compare bitcoins vs gold, then compare the sum value of all bitcoins in the world vs the sum value of all gold in the world.

Take a look back at bitcoin during 2011.  While I'm quite optimistic that the long term trend (over the next few years) is very positive, I'm also quite sure there will be dips and rallies along the way.  If you're buying in for the short term, it's very much a gamble.

Well, I think the main factor fueling the flames of these asset bubbles is easy credit creation enabled by fractional reserve banking and loose central bank monetary policy.  That's what allows the bubbles to grow so big, and thus fall so far when they pop.  Not that a certain amount of bubble behavior wouldn't happen without those contributing factors, but I think the overly easy access to credit certainly amplifies the size of it all.  In the type of deflationary system I was just describing, there would be natural inhibitors on loans and credit as the economy started to speed up (I realize the fed is supposed to more or less perform this role, but I think the autonomous version would be a bit more reliable) - the faster the economy grows, the more restrictive the loan environment becomes.  Prevention would be the theme here rather than fixing it all after it blew up.  We have a tendency to blame credit crunches for our woes, but when you look at charts like [this]( it seems fair to wonder whether the real problem was the growth phase that preceded it.
There's more I'd like to add about changes to fractional reserve banking once you have an appreciating medium to save in, and also about mass psychology and societal learning, but at the moment my brain is a bit fried and I need to unwind with something mindless lol.  On the latter subject, let's just say that if bitcoin does ever get so big as for any of this discussion to be relevant, then on the way there society is going to get an awfully comprehensive crash course on the nature of bubble behavior :)  I think those of us involved early are already deep into bubble psychology 101.

How is that a safe assumption?  Sure, some people use them destructively, but others do not.  People can destroy their lives with any number of substances or activities - think of how many people "destroyed their lives" with a World of Warcraft addiction!  Your argument could be stretched to all of these things by claiming they destroy (some) lives and thus distributing them is immoral.  Is that your intended argument?  Do you really think opening up a brewery is immoral because some alcoholics ruin their lives with the substance?
If a substance or activity is being used/undertaken out of a person's own volition, then any negative consequences are ultimately that person's responsibility.

You're not wrong, but you're talking about an incremental difference - a few percentage points per year.  That might cut off a few purchases you might have otherwise made, but basically what's going on in this scenario is that our personal incentive structure is being swung back a bit towards savings over consumption; at least relative to where it is now.  That does pose the question though - what is the right balance of those incentives?  Right now we have an inflation target - is that number the right target for balancing consumption with saving?  These are a lot more subtle considerations than simply saying "deflationary currencies don't work because people won't buy things".  There's a debate to be had here, and my personal opinion is that we currently over-incentivize consumption in general, but I'm fine with differing opinions on that matter.  I'm not fine with the idea that a currency that deflates due to a growing economy "won't work" because of an over-simplified argument about people not buying anything.  I think that's an argument that completely overlooks the actual subtleties of the situation.

Lawsuits are means to confiscate other's money/possessions ultimately backed up by the state's legal monopoly over force. Some choose to refer to that force as violence.  I prefer force, but this is ultimately semantics, so whatever. 
I'm not saying all law suits are wrong obviously, as they certainly have a place (fraud and the like), I'm just explaining what they are.  If you resort to a lawsuit, you're enlisting the force of the state's legal authority. 
Also, rights are not some universal thing - they are constantly evolving and being debated, at least legally speaking.  There is a debate over what rights you should have to your intellectual property; simply saying "you have them whether you like it or not" doesn't really add to the discussion.  The discussion is over what the laws should be, not what they are now.

So was the previous rise from $15-$60 in a couple months a "bubble"?  Many people thought that at the time, but it never dropped below ~$60 again.  
Bitcoin is going to grow rapidly; it's hard to know which periods of growth will be retracted in a correction and which ones won't.  Saying "it's growing rapidly so this must be a bubble" isn't particularly convincing logic.  This could be March, not April :)  We'll only really know in retrospect, but in the meantime you can speculate either way.

Not just as willing, but only marginally less willing.  Basically, it's not as simple as saying, "deflationary currencies won't work because people won't spend".  It will tweak incentives towards saving over spending relative to an inflationary system, but "tweak" is the key word here; it's not like people will just stop spending entirely.  There will be some purchases at the margin that will get cut off.  I personally think we would benefit from a bit stronger incentive to save - we've been steadily saving less and less and growing more and more in debt as a society (at least in America).  I certainly don't think it's crazy to suggest that we might be better off reversing that trend a bit.  Whether you agree or not, it seems like a reasonable debate to have.

It fundamentally comes down to how much value you think there is in the "service" provided by bitcoin.  It's different than the current status quo currencies, that's for sure.  If you think it's an improvement, then the upside potential is huge.  If you think it's not, then it's a bubble.

I still think your best bet for orders of that size in the US is coinbase, despite some of the problems people have been having with them canceling "high risk" orders lately.  Even with their level 1 verification, you could buy that amount in 3 days (10BTC per day limit) with current prices.  Set it up now and put in a small order so you get established in their system; might help avoid getting flagged as high risk later.  And even if you do, it seems like if you're patient and stick with their support then they'll eventually make it right.  I think they're just understaffed for the recent surge; not anything malicious.

I'm sure some people will look at me like a looney for suggesting this, but add the "risk free bond market" (basically bonds issued in the currency of the issuer - nominally risk free, but not risk free in real rates) to the list of markets bitcoin could intrude on in terms of a store of wealth.  The US bond market alone accounts for about 35 trillion (edit - I derped and should clarify that "only" ~14 trillion of that would be US gov bonds, however the global total for risk free govt bonds still adds up to around 40 trillion).
The risk-free bond market is largely a necessity because we have inflationary currencies.  If you want to try to maintain value in the nominally "safest" way in such a system, you purchase government bonds of the currency issuer.  With a deflationary currency, that's not necessary.  You just save the currency itself.  Gold used to fill that role until a concerted effort by the central banks of the world (lead by the US) to demonetize it and diminish its role in the financial system (that's not conspiracy theory, you can read about the efforts from first hand sources at the time [here]( and [here](  
In short, there are three markets that bitcoin can potentially siphon value from - currency, gold, and risk free bonds.  Such an asset is not unprecedented; not too long ago that was essentially gold's role in the financial system.  Those three markets combined are currently worth over 100 trillion.
Bitcoin is potentially so disruptive because it's a deflationary currency, and if it becomes prominent then that aspect of it basically flips the entire financial world on its head.  Obviously I can't say whether or not it's going to get there, but that's the potential where it can really go "to the moon", and I *can* say that the properties of bitcoin represent an unprecedented development in monetary history, so really we just have to wait and see how it goes.  We've genuinely never had an asset at our disposal like bitcoin.  It combines the ease of use, convenience, and efficiency of modern digital fiat with the lack of a central authority and reliable scarcity aspects of gold - in fact, it's not a stretch to say that it actually improves upon the strengths of both of them.

People have been calling "obvious bubble" since the 60-70 dollar range.  People call "bubble" pretty much anytime a volatile asset does well.  The truth is, while calling "bubble" is easy, specifying the magnitude of the key bubble points (where it'll top off, where it'll settle at) is what's actually difficult and where everyone is probably completely full of shit if they claim they "knew".

Well bitcoins (and cryptocurrencies in general) are new, gold isn't.  If you believe that bitcoins are gold 2.0, then the only fundamental you need for it to go up in value is public perception as a store of value - the main fundamental behind gold.  
That said, I do think there will be plenty of boom-busts in bitcoin's future, but I also the think the overwhelming trend will be as it has been - up.  And it won't be based on the kind of fundamentals you're looking for.

The point is that if you have a build up of pure speculators with very weak hands, *that's* going to result in huge volatility down the road.  I'll take more frequent minor corrections than one infrequent but giant one.  See: 2011.  That was far more volatile than anything we're seeing right now.

@_date: 2013-04-12 16:56:14
Bitcoin's current problems have nothing to do with its rate of monetary inflation (its current yearly supply expansion is ~15%).  It's volatile because there's a ton of speculation surrounding it because it's still new and has a incredibly wide range of potential - people are still trying to figure out where to value it, and when that value starts to creep up you can easily trigger a speculative bubble.  You could replace it right now with a crypto currency that was designed to stabalize at 1-4% inflation and it would have the exact same problems and volatility we're seeing now.
If you want to work on eliminating speculative bubbles, answer this question - how do you start and spread a new cryptocurrency while managing *price inflation* to be either small or zero?  That's how you would avoid the speculative mania - by managing and stabalizing the price by manipulating the supply (that's why the federal reserve manipulates the money supply in an attempt to keep inflation within a certain range).

Bitcoin isn't really useful as a unit of account yet because of its volatility.  Businesses that accept bitcoins will just set prices in Dollars and convert to bitcoins at the point of sale.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:25:00
*edit* - since people are downvoting, here's [proof]( that the the LTC spreads already are matching the BTC spreads between China and the rest of the world.  OKCoin is a chinese exchange that accepts LTC.  The spread in BTC between OKCoin and BTC-e is 35%.  The spread in LTC between the same two exchanges is 37%.  People are already arbing with LTC as much as they can.  It is saturated.  Downvote if you want, but... it's still true.  *end edit*
Think this through.  The reason why this spread isn't being arbitraged efficiently is because of Dollar-Yuan illiquidity.  While China is talking about opening up, they still have a iron wall of capital controls in place.
Let's say BTC China accepts LTC.  People buy BTC in the West, send them to China.  There, they sell them for LTC, move the LTC back to the west, and buy BTC again.  Move the BTC to China, sell for LTC, repeat.
In the west, everyone is buying BTC and selling LTC.  In the East, everyone is selling BTC and buying LTC.  There will be a massive flow of LTC westwards, and the price of LTC in the west will crash and its price in China will skyrocket.  This spread will shut down the arbitrage opportunity once the LTC spread rises to match the BTC spread.  This will happen quickly since the BTC market is many times larger than the LTC market.
It'd help a little bit, but only a little.  That spread is not going away until a medium *bigger* than BTC allows for the free flow of value to balance out the markets desire to send bitcoins to China.  That medium generally needs to be Dollar/Yuan convertibility.  LTC, being a much smaller market than bitcoin, would be rapidly overwhelmed.

It does if you measure positive/negative relative to expectations.  Considering everyone had rather "negative" expectations as to the government's treatment of bitcoin, that's a rather reasonable way to do it.  I think it's viewed as a "positive" by some people because many people were worried that the government would outright shit on bitcoin by declaring it an illegal competing currency.  We'd all love it if the government ignored it entirely forever, but no one actually expects that - thus the regulations that did come were actually *better* than many people expected, thus considering it a positive.  It's not intuitive to characterize something as a negative if it is in fact better than expected.

So the gold market is 1.8 trillion, and about half of that is investment bars and bullion.  Of that half, another ~1/3 is central banks.  Of the remaining investors, how many are tech savvy?  Not just "I can use a computer and tweet" tech savvy, but well versed enough to actually understand what bitcoin is and why it works?  I think 10% is a very generous number there.  And of those people, what percentage of their wealth are they going to put into bitcoin compared to gold?  Bitcoin is *much* higher risk and higher reward, thus you wouldn't make an equal investment - you would put in maybe 10% of what you had in gold, especially if you're looking at your gold investment as a safe haven/store of wealth role.  If you're trying to just make a ton of money, maybe you put in more, but most already wealthy people who own gold do so to mainly an a form of insurance to maintain their wealth.  Us shrimps with piddly net worths are probably the ones putting the biggest positions (percentage wise) of our wealth in something as risky as bitcoin (with some exceptions, of course).  Whales only need to take a relatively small bite... for now at least.
So .5 x .66 x .1 x .1 x 1.8 trillion = 4 billion.  Based off those admittedly rough numbers, that's the amount of wealth you'd expect to be put in bitcoin if sufficiently tech savvy gold investors decided they wanted some exposure to bitcoin.  We're certainly in that ballpark.  I think that 1.8 trillion number is actually too low, btw, but I think the numbers would still be within an order of magnitude of where we are now.

The thing is, if the scenario you're predicting does play out then you *will* make a tremendous profit (in terms of purchasing power) from them.  Those expectations kinda go hand in hand.  Doesn't make sense to expect one without the other.
*edit* - If you disagree, I'd love to hear a scenario of how bitcoin changes the world without skyrocketing in value.

To claim otherwise kinda reeks of phony virtue...
I personally buy bitcoins because I love the concept.  That means I want them to succeed, and in the process I do expect my bitcoins to be worth a lot more.  That's just the way it works, isn't it?

That doesn't make any sense.  If no one was selling or spending, the price would just go up, at least in the short term.

Bitcoin's primary advantage over any other cryptocurrency at this point would be its [network effect](  The more people that use a currency, the more useful it is.  The only way another crypto could be expected to compete with Bitcoin is if it has a fundamental advantage in its design that would allow it to overcome Bitcoin's network effect advantage.
For an example of how network effect works in other markets, see something like ebay - in order to build a competing website to ebay, you'd have to build it with some sort of fundamental and significant advantage over ebay otherwise there's no reason for anyone to use your site.  Ebay already has a large market, and that network is essential in making Ebay an effective service - a marketplace with no buyers/sellers is about as worthless as a social network with no socialites.  Similarly, the value of a currency is directly tied to the size of the market that uses it.
Services that benefit from network effect naturally tend towards monopoly since the bigger they are the more useful they are. 
TL/DR: see Wingsuit's comment.
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:34:29
The better way to look at it is, "Can bitcoin become a prominent form of money?"  Varying degrees of answering "yes" correspond to those price ranges.  The value of bitcoin is directly tied to how widely adopted and used it is - it can't succeed without its value going up substantially because those two results are essentially intertwined.  And likewise, if it fails to gain and maintain traction due to any number of reasons, it's value will drop significantly.
What percentage of the people and businesses you know actually use bitcoin?  That's the growth potential, and growth directly correlates to higher prices.

How exactly is this chart demonstrating net present value?  The calculations look extremely simple - 1% of the total potential market share of bitcoin (assuming 2014 supply) comes out to 10.4k per coin, using the numbers given at the bottom of their chart.  So if it meets that potential next year, its "fair value" would be $10.4k.  The 20 year number is simply 10.4k divided by 20... that to me implies they're just saying that if it gets to 1% via a linear progression over 20 years, its fair value next year would be $520, which corresponds to 1/20th of 1%.  This is just a very simple calculation of the potential "fair value" of bitcoin for next year, reached by assuming peak penetration percentages and linear growth rates to those peaks.  You don't have to involve NPV at all to calculate these numbers.

Monopolies are terrible for the customer, but they're generally quite profitable for the monopolizer.  Is that the case with mining though?  What do you think would happen to the value of bitcoin if a mining company monopolized the mining market?  I know I'd be diversifying (if not fully converting) to other alt-currencies, which as we all know already exist.  You wouldn't do the same?  It seems perfectly logical to me that a lot of people would do the same, and a plummeting currency value would be disastrous for the profitability of a monopolizing miner.  They're paid in their own currency, after all.


Converting to an alt-currency is *exactly* what they'd do.  Your conclusion that "they'll begrudgingly go along with the mining monopoly" does not logically follow - they'll sell!  There's a tremendous monetary incentive to be an early adopter of a successful alt currency - any peril in bitcoin would be just the catalyst needed to send people fleeing to another en masse.  If you're concerned about your self interest, you don't hold onto a critically flawed currency, you jump ship to the rising one ASAP.  If there's a lot of infrastructure around bitcoin that makes it convenient to use, then I'd leave the equivalent of my checking account in bitcoin, but you bet I'd be moving my savings to whatever medium I thought would give me the best long term return, and I'm certain I wouldn't be the only one.  Wouldn't you?

Oh.  Yeah that's fine imo.  My point is the later the correction came, the bigger the drop would be.  If it's big now, imagine if the price kept running up another few hundred bucks. I was scared of China pumping us all the way up to like 600-700 or more way too quickly.

So again, hypothetically speaking, you would be an obedient citizen of Nazi Germany even though you were aware what was going on?  Again, is there ever a line that gets crossed?  You say "reform the government" as if that's a trivial thing to do.  If you're in the minority, it's very difficult to reform a democratic government.
And just to be clear, I might be an obedient citizen as well simply out of a desire for self preservation, but it certainly wouldn't be because I thought "it was the right thing to do".  Sometimes your society is exporting disaster onto others, and it's the people obediently giving the government power that ultimately allow that to happen.

Their proposal sucks, I get that.  I'm talking about a middle ground where users could tag transactions as theft and request info if anyone has any that could help.  When receiving some coins, you could be notified if they were tagged as such, and judge whether you think you have information that would help, and if so you could choose to offer it.  I'm not suggesting any restrictions on actually receiving/spending those coins.

That's the opposite of money printing; it's money destruction.  It is similar in that it's fundamentally an abuse of power for personal gain, but it's basically the opposite in terms of the actual mechanism.

My point is those $10 could have been worth $16 if you bought BTC instead of a domain name.  Whether or not you use Dollars or bitcoins, you're still eating that opportunity cost, because those Dollars could always buy bitcoins instead.  Dollars and bitcoins are pretty much interchangeable, particularly if you have an exchange account setup.
I personally think it's pretty simple - decide how much you want to save in BTC based on your risk tolerance.  If you want to make a purchase and you can do it in BTC, try to do so - it helps the BTC economy as a whole, which is a long term investment in the value of your own BTC.  Use Dollars to replenish the BTC you spent to maintain your desired savings.  You don't have to do that 1:1 with every transaction, just manage it periodically.  If you use something like Gyft for giftcards, you save 3% using BTC so that should cover any fees involved in converting Dollars to bitcoins as well.  They have Amazon giftcards, so right away you can use it for all your Amazon purchases, which at least for me is quite a significant chunk of my shopping.

Ponzi scheme may be a bit harsh since you aren't selling this as an "investment", but the transactions being valid has nothing to do with it.  Ponzi schemes make money too for all but those left holding the empty bag at the end, just like your bitcoin sword.  The mechanism at work here is basically the same thing as a ponzi scheme - those earlier in the chain profit at the expense of the big loser at the end.  The only difference here is you've made it clear that's how it works, so yeah, not fraudulent.

I have a question about how 796 operates, maybe you can help clear it up.  It seems you deposit btc and then they offer leveraged trading, 2x in the long direction and 4x for shorts.  If everyone bets long and the price goes up, do they just eat the losses themselves?  Are they actually backing those bets in the background by buying double the btc for longs (or whatever ratio is appropriate to balance longs with shorts)?  If they aren't, I fear for their solvency in any big price run-up... there's no guarantee there will be enough shorts to offset the longs (it seems they'd need about a 2:1 ratio of longs to shorts to eliminate risk for themselves).  Or is there some way of guaranteeing this risk neutrality that I'm missing?    Normal exchanges don't have this problem obviously since the buyers and sellers directly offset each other (and by consequence, move the price), but 796 just uses the mtgox price from what I can tell.  Are they just hoping for a roughly 2:1 ratio of longs to shorts and are willing to take the risk that comes with any deviation from that ratio?

It's open source software, meaning the code is publicly available for all to see.  It doesn't rule the possibility out entirely, but as it would have to be "hidden" in plain sight, it makes it highly unlikely. Plenty of smart people have poured over that code and studied it closely.

I like Nassim, but I don't agree with the point he made here at all.  I think BTC would explode like wildfire if no government fought it.  Why the hell would it just fade away if there was no resistance?  Perhaps he means that if bitcoin is truly disruptive, it will be fought, and that I agree with, but I think it's worded poorly in that case.  We know what bitcoin is already, and I don't really need government reactions to prove it to me.

I agree with that much.  I just sometimes feel like there's people who think that taking away someone's right to enslave people is somehow a greater offense than enslaving people.  If you think you have the right to take away someone else's liberty, then you forfeit the right to your own.  As someone who values liberty, that's how my rulebook works.

The goxbux-dollar trade is also very illiquid, hence the discrepancy.
You don't get these kinds of spreads without some sort of illiquidity that makes arbitrage difficult.
But yes, I agree that bitcoin itself (and cryptos in general) are very liquid by nature, and if all inputs/outputs in an exchange were as liquid then we wouldn't see these massive spreads.  I see that was your point all along, I think I misinterpreted :)

Because, aside from the whole currency thing, a lot of people are making a lot of money simply by holding bitcoin.  People tend to get excited when they make money so easily - why on earth would that be a surprise to you?  Sure volatility is not ideal but if bitcoins do see widespread use one day they're going to be worth a lot more than they are now, and you have to get there somehow.

That's how I understood you actually.  My point is still that I don't think bitcoin is a good idea because I bought some, I bought some because I think it's a good idea.  I wouldn't invest in anything that I didn't actually believe in.  It's not like my efforts are going to make or break bitcoin anyway.

The disincentive to further growth (and incentive to decentralize) would  be a falling price of bitcoins as people begin to get concerned and start hedging with alt currencies.  Miners are paid in bitcoins - they are very price sensitive.  When they see people voicing discontent and starting to move money to other currencies, I think it'd be perfectly rational for them to take steps to decentralize and restore confidence - after all, the miner with the most to lose would be the one that's ultimately causing the problem (the one with the biggest market share).  And that's for the ones stupid enough to let it get to that point - I think most will likely be more like BTC guild and be well aware of the problem in advance and thus take preventative measures before it gets to that point.

Why would the answer to those two questions be any different based on what that "something" is?  You'd be faced with a similar trade off no matter what object you're talking about.  
And no, the argument that "but computers are depreciating assets" does not work any longer, because under the scenario proposed (deflationary currency) pretty much *everything* is a depreciating asset, only to varying degrees.  Why would you buy a depreciating computer but not a depreciating something else?

It went from under a dollar to 33 dollars in two months.
It went from 15 dollars to 260 dollars in two months.

It's pretty simple really.  I think the architecture of bitcoin (decentralized crypto-currency with pre-determined and transparent supply expansion, tailing off to zero) is superior to our current central bank issued currencies.  If that's true, then bitcoin is poised to take the lead in a roughly 30-80 trillion dollar market.  The value of bitcoins in such a case would be well over $100,000+ (over a million is still a realistic scenario).  Thus I don't think a price runup to 235 dollars is anything to blink at.  Is it speculation?  Sure.  But what matters is whether that speculation turns out to be right or not.

My point is still to quote prices people can actually get.  The mtgox/chinese exchange "USD" price isn't actually a USD price as the former won't give you your dollars readily and the latter won't give you dollars at all, and good luck converting Yuan to Dollars on your own.  It's not about a US thing, it's a Dollar thing.  It's simply not possible for most people to convert bitcoins to Dollars at that price, at which point I consider that price misleading.  I don't consider it misleading in Yuan because there are numerous exchanges paying that amount in Yuan right now.  But they don't pay in USD, and while there is a USD/Yuan exchange rate, it's a very illiquid one, which makes it of limited use.
Again, the very fact that the sizable arb opportunity exists *proves* that you can't actually get Dollars in those amounts, otherwise someone would be doing it and getting rich, and in the process the arb would disappear.  The bottom line is that there is no significant amount of trade going on *anywhere in the world* where BTC is actually being exchanged for that many Dollars.  Like I said, it's not an American problem, it's a Dollar problem.

First of all, you need to buy/sell on an exchange for the price to be visible, and second of all, there is no exchange (to my knowledge) that allows you to arbitrarily buy at some high price above the market.  You can either place a market order (which buys/sells at the best market price) or a limit order (which, using buying as an example, is an order to buy at *or below* the specified price).  If you put in a limit order for $2000 when the market price is $800 it'll just fill it at $800.  It assumes there's no legitimate reason for over-spending.

Pretty unlikely.  They don't torture high profile white people scheduled to stand trial, the potential PR issues are totally not worth it.  At most they'd just fuck with him psychologically with solitary confinement and the like.  I know you could call that torture, but I'm assuming you meant more overt shit like waterboarding or whatever.
