How is this different? You trust a "black box" assuming that it is not compromised.

That's exactly what happened in 2017. And it will happen again soon if fees stay that high.

This. And people need to learn to look into the future instead assuming adoption will stagnate.

So is the paper wallet generator.

No ruler, but strong control of public opinion. One of the biggest governmental psyops so far.

History being rewritten much?

The source is also visible on the website version. When was the last time you reviewed the source code of your Trezor?

I agree. Unfortunately this also contributes to a very bad user experience when small utxos get lost because of values lower than fees.

The point you are missing is that we won't onboard any new users with these fees. Even just for opening and closing lightning channels this is too high. This is stagnation for bitcoin at best and worst case people will turn away.

In bitcoin it doesn't matter who you are and how much you transfer.
Fact is that the fees are to high to warrant any transfer below a few hundred USD.

Just seeing the lightnings is fine for me.

The article is one year old. I doubt that this is the current state.

If you want to remove outliers you can take the median, which is still over 2 USD.
And this at a time without any significant media attention.
@_date: 2019-05-29 09:51:31
@_date: 2019-05-29 22:23:29


Well, we are currently at 5 USD average fees.
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:15:44
The current bull run is probably institutional investors.
Compared to 2017 more people might already know about bitcoin and search more specifically (eg for exchanges).
@_date: 2019-05-29 09:48:15
Time teavellers, bitcoin developed by aliens, whats next?
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:29:41
We should reduce the blocksize to 640 kB.

Being an older version is not necessarily a disadvantage in this case. The longer it has been field tested the better you know that the seed generation process works properly.

1) Install tails on a usb stick.
2) Run tails on offline computer and start electrum (included in tails) with usb random number generator
3) Connect printer and print qr codes (make sure to destroy the printer after using in case it has an internal memory)

I am also drunk and I fully agree with every single word.

Please just ignore this scammer. Not worth posting about him.

Amazing how a progressive community can still host this blatant racism.
@_date: 2019-05-29 09:49:30
Great explanation. Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2019-05-29 09:45:16
Thanks, very good explanation.
