I’ll chip in to buy you a ticket on the next plane to Venezuela so you can experience the socialist paradise you dream of.

I use Exodus wallet which allows you to exchange between certain cryptos easily using shapeshift. It's good for exchanging bitcoin to others like dash, etherium, and litecoin, but exchanging it from altcoins back to bitcoin involves paying higher fees.

Its already back to 10600. The bitcoin train is leaving the atmosphere. Buckle up bitches.

Yeah 4% gdp growth, a 70% drop in illegal border crossings, and defeating ISIS in his first year is destroying America. Get a grip and stop watching CNN.

I feel in some ways our generation was ripped off and betrayed by the bankers and our government. I graduated college in 08 right as the recession started. It really fucked my whole life up. No jobs, student loan debt, and depression. Bitcoin going to the moon feels like payback for the theft of our future by the elite.

Yep new world order. Everyone will eventually be forced to take the chip. The antichrist will rule the Earth. Watch black mirror. Thats whats coming for us. Are you ready? Im trying to use bitcoin to free myself from this techno dystopia while I still can.

They are both different and solve different problems. Why not have both?
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:02:49
Or you could 3D print a replica t rex skull and save money to buy more bitcoin with.

While you were out playing paddycake with Pedro, I was making $200 bucks on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:02:23
Im so terribly bad at buying the dips. Every time I buy its at an ATH. Oh well, still making awesome money.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:24:27
Yeah 4% gdp growth, a 70% drop in illegal border crossings, and defeating ISIS in his first year is destroying America. Results are much more important than your feelings.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:37:18
Would it be possible to 3D print a whole t-rex skeleton on the cheap? If I had a big enough living room...

I live in China. Localbitcoins works here. Using Alipay to buy is really convenient.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:18:53
Yeah, its almost like we have someone competent in the white house for the first time in a long time. Lowest jobless rate in 16 years, 4% gdp growth, illegal immigration dropping, less regulation on small business, lower tax rates, ISIS defeated. All in his first year. The media and leftists can cry all they want, but results speak louder than their REEEEEs.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:48:07
H M M M M I guess its pretty clear
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:12:30
Thats a lot of dollaridoos.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:37:13
Im impatient so I always end up buying at the ATH every damn time. Still made +25% this week.
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:38:06
I picked a good week to buy my first 0.1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:10:05
I got into bitcoin a week ago. I had just bought some bitcoin and put them into my EXODUS wallet when BOOM! My computer went crazy and the my computer locked up. The screen was a million colors and it made this terrible noise I had never heard before. I was terrified thinking I had been hacked or lost those bitcoin somehow. After several tries, my computer finally started back up. I load up Exodus and I get an “Wallet load error” and have no access to my wallet. Did a restore with my 12 word key, reset my passphrase, and to my relief, my wallet loaded up, but it said $0.00. OMG my heart is about to give out for the third time in 10 minutes. Suddenly, I hear a glorious sound of coins pouring into my wallet. Everything was back as it should be.
Now, don’t you feel better? I went through that ordeal and if something similar happens, just remember me and dont panic. Everything will be ok.

im in China right now. Awake and watching my money skyrocket. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:23:30
Dash is doing really well.

I live in China and half the people here are already paying with their phones using wechat or alipay. Its simply amazinf how fast this technology is going mainstream.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:22:29
I guess Im a hodler. I dont even know how to sell.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:57:17
I dont even know how to sell.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:07:04
I literally just bought at 11200 and then it plummets to 10500 ten minutes later. FML
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:36:49
Asia in general is adopting digital currency and digital payments way faster than the west. I live in China and they have pretty much switched from cash to wechat/alipay for everything. About half the people here use their phone to pay for everything and barely ever use cash. Its crazy how fast this is happening. Thats why bitcoin and digital currency is unstoppable.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:07:43
Same here. :’(
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:52:58
Me too bro. It sucks but dont let it get you down.

Me too. :’(

When the shit hits the fan, it always hapens locally. As long as electricity, the internet, and computers survive in a single developed country, bitcoin will survive and it will prbably fare better than most fiat currency. If a worldwide apocalypse occurs (which is extremely unlikely) it wont matter anyway because we’ll all be fucked.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:30:30
Yep, about 10 minutes after I bought. Feelsbadman
