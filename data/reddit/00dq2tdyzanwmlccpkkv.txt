And every two weeks, the difficulty advances to the average of the prior two weeks. Progress is nullified.
When the second great halving comes in 2016, we'll see the hashrate drop as it did before.

Snowden showed that the USB bus has been compromised, and this wouldn't stop an attacker from accessing keys / approving transactions over the bus.

I want to work on a $10 hardware keyring for the masses, which can handle any method of public-key crypto. Its method of communication with a phone is simple and spoof-proof. I'm a computer engineer with $50k/yr in expenditures (fiancee is in graduate school) so I can't leave my current job as a data scientist &amp; embedded engineer. 
Please message me for more details and evidence, as a benefactor for my engineering could help billions of people exit and increase the value of Bitcoin.

What's BitCoin?

You can have others hold Bitcoin instead of Fiat. $10k is a good argument for a currency.

If the human can't approve every message on the USB bus, then anyone could request signatures from the hardware wallet.

You're getting a great value for your money. Eventually the people pushing down the markets will want to make money too, and you'll ride with them.
The losers of the first adopters sold at $5. Don't be them.

This is exactly what we need!!!
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:33:47
I'm working on it.
@_date: 2014-09-07 13:20:03
Working on it. Spoof-proof communication.
