Sorry for asking the hard question but:
You don't acknowledge legal liability for the people who had their segregated HD wallet drained? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:15:44
What's there to socialize when almost all bitcoins are gone? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:18:03
Keep the downvotes coming idiots and finex shills. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:27:59
Because he couldn't. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:39:59
It means directly this.
All exchanges - when customers get hacked deny the liability. 
Segregated wallets legally mean the following: Bitfinex controls the coins, you own them. 
The proof of burden on liability is on you in this case if they don't acknowledge, which they aren't. 
Hiding behind segregated wallets and their TOS only works as long as there is no court involved. 
If you have a lot of BTC on Bitfinex high 6 to 7 figures. You have to get a big law firm like DLA Piper on the case and force Bitfinex into bankruptcy to save at least 20-30% of your money. 
Otherwise they reopen and everyone withdraws their money and you get a worthless judgement 2 years later. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:29:58
Also you clearly don't know the legal difference between control and ownership. 
Segregated wallet = Bitfinex controls the coins, you own them.
Non-segregated wallet = Bitfinex controls and owns the coins - they owe you the value of the coins.
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:58:02
Why would Bitfinex be liable for theft of your segregated BTC? They would not be liable in this case with how they describe their system. 
The proof of burden is on you in this case. And the fact is the funds weren't actually segregated. 
Whatever is missing from your account is your tough luck. That's the strategy they are trying to use to keep their company solvent. 
Is it so hard to understand? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:39:33
Then why are they trying to blame the losses on to the customer?
"Yes... of course. All of users' bitcoin is held in individual accounts."
"Guess where those deposits/withdrawals come from/go to... individual accounts' wallets."
They are trying to deflect the liability. You are responsible for whatever happend to your "segregated" amount of btc. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:08:51
The whole point of segregating the BTC is to protect user funds from bankruptcy of the exchange.
Now we turn the problem around and the loss of the user funds in segregate wallets protects the exchange from bankruptcy by shifting liability to the users. 
ALL EXCHANGES HAVE HAD CUSTOMERS WHO WERE HACKED AND THEY DENIED LIABILITY FOR IT.
Bitfinex is doing the same, just on a bigger basis. They deny the legal liability for those coins and the proof of burden is on you.
In 2 or 3 years from now when courts decide something you can plaster your whole wall with their judgement, because until then all the money that could be distributed pro rata is gone.
The only chance to stop this is to get a quick cease and desist order, forcing them into bankruptcy. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:44:50
I will thank you forever 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:27:54
What creditors?
"Individuals owned the bitcoin in the wallets... it would be ridiculous to think that an exchange owns anybody who deposits' funds."
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:59:46
"Individuals owned the bitcoin in the wallets... it would be ridiculous to think that an exchange owns anybody who deposits' funds."
So who will take the losses? Bitfinex or the customer? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:21:54
Legally they really can't do anything besides either file for bankruptcy or deny liability for the theft.
In cases where the users are at fault password phishing, etc. all exchanges blame the user and dont pay anything. 
I don't think that view hold up in court but it would take years as the proof of burden is on the user. 
If they don't file for bankruptcy while being insolvent, there are criminal penalties and also the possibility of personal liability arises (piercing the corporate veil). 
Usually they have around 2 weeks to file for bankruptcy. 
Also haircuts, without a court order are 100% illegal, they are theft. 
File for bankruptcy and users can accept the haircut, work out a deal and become shareholder etc. is the only real legal solution that can happen. 
(You can find these legal concepts anywhere without knowing the details of every jurisdiction, whether it's Asia,  US or Europe). 
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:50:42
Don't let them get away with it 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:11:12
I know that they are company in Hong Kong that's why I recommended a big international law company that ranks very high in Hong Kong. 
There are maybe 2-3 ways I can think of to force them into bankruptcy if they don't do it themselves.
One of the easiest way would be to file bankruptcy for them. Assets &lt; liabilities, every court will agree. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:47:07
You can force them into bankruptcy, if you act quickly.  Bitfinex will get liquidated - all people with eth, usd and ltc lose money.
So it only makes sense if you have a lot of stolen BTC on Bitfinex. You will get 10-30% back instead of nothing. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:42:10
Bitfinex won't be bankrupt if they can shift the liability of the losses to the customer. 
Just like any other exchange where hackers steal money from dumb users. The problem in this case is just that all the users are out of luck. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:31:08
Where have they declared legal liability for the losses?
They will hide behind the pseudo-segregated wallets and keep their site running, without the customers who had BTC on it. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:45:08
If your property gets stolen, you have to proof the liability of the person in control of it.

Hello Dean,
this is my friend Stephen. He lost his kidneys due to a rare e.coli infection and now suffers immensly physically but also financially. He has been part of this community for years and it would mean a lot.

Full quote: "Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all had this in common: that the step was first, the road new, the vision unborrowed, and the response they received--hatred. The great creators--the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors--stood alone against the men of their time. Every great new thought was opposed. Every great new invention was denounced. The first motor was considered foolish. The first airplane was considered impossible. The power loom was considered vicious. Anesthesia was considered sinful. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. They fought, they suffered and they paid. But they won."
I started talking about Bitcoin when we were below 100m market cap. You can imagine how it went. It's a ponzi scheme, it's a joke. They had no clue about bitcoin but that didn't stop them from having an opinion. Now at 8 or 10bn market cap they're still trying to deny bitcoins sucess but you feel their anger inside them. They were wrong and can't admit it.

This is a joke. Nice scam.

92 million dollar / 434 million dollar = 21.1% 
Bit lower due to yen going down... 
@_date: 2016-02-17 01:48:30
It's all calculated in yen value.

Not true. Actually the biggest expense right now is deloitte - the accounting company supposed to recover more money for creditors. They did cost like 2.4 million dollar.

@_date: 2016-02-15 18:44:36
There are still 202k bitcoins left to distribute... 
I think the current pro rata quota is close to 20% of your claim value.

If I remember correctly the stocks will go down if the BTC price goes up. Asciminer may be one exception. 
@_date: 2013-09-12 14:18:28
If bitcoin becomes successful on a global level what would the market cap be? 50 or 100bn. x100 that's still a black swan ;)

How about a fair share regulation requiring everyone to declare how much bitcoin they have and then distribute them equally to the people? 
It's fair simple and absolute moral.

The problem is the production of child pornography. You can trade child pornography with cash, bitcoin or with rocks. Nothing legitimates the government to play big brother just to prevent trading child pornography. 
So you're telling me international banks don't care about AML? If it doesn't work with banks then we certainly don't need it for bitcoin. It becomes something the government uses randomly. The owner of Liberty Reserve is in jail for harming nobody. Maybe some customers traded child porn with LR but the government acts like a despot for putting that guy in jail and not the child porn freaks.
