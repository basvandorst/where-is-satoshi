You can use deposit based verification, where they make a deposit and you just verify the amounts. But that's pretty slow, took me a weekish for that to happen. 
If you want to do the instant verification (give them your login/pass for your bank site), just change your password on your bank account first to a temp password, give coinbase the temp login info for verification, then change your password again afterwards. 
You are giving them the 1 minute window they need to verify, then taking their access away immediately. 
I understand feeling uncomfortable about giving up this info, but coinbase is very open about their operation which made me more comfortable. Unlike a lot of other sites I've seen, they have their about page ( shows a level of openness and transparency that made me comfortable with the 1 minute access I gave them.

I can't stress enough how important this is. 
Make a paper wallet, put a few transactions into it for a total of like 5 usd, then redeem the wallet somewhere. 
The first time i tried to "swipe" my wallet, I was really confused about how the whole thing worked and thought I'd lost a sizable chunk of BTC. 
Paper wallets are great, but make *SURE* you understand how everything about them works first.

I check up with Coindesk.com daily. 
The site is created by one of the owners of spotify, I realize that's not a "reputable news source" by any means, but it's not some jackass in his basement. (not that there's anything wrong with that... I lived in a basement for 10 years, no joke.)

I think you'd have more luck doing a tournament thing. I'm pretty sure TotalBiscuit just did a starcraft2 tournament where the winners got BTC.

Or on a corner? I'm not sure what's easiest for your setup. And honestly, if the code works, then it's kind of a "whatever" situation. :P

Sarcasm aside, he's right. We should.

I find him entertaining... in sort of a... "Entertain me, fool!" way. 
it reminds me of the gif of the monkey sniffing his finger after scratching his ass. You can't help but laugh.

oh god, it's the grim!!! wait... no...

You should consider selling these. I have a feeling YOUR wallet might get a bit heavier if you were to sell these. 
I'd buy one. (for a reasonable price, of course) 
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:55:18
I can definitely see that. As someone who knows *zero* about how these are made, I guess I kind of thought it was "scan an image, tell the machine to go, then sand and paint."

You crazy! 
Gyft is the best thing ever. 
I know that I spend, roughly, 100 bucks a week on food for my wife and I. This allows me to put 400 bucks into my btc wallet when I get paid, and cash out a $100 gyft card each week to go shopping with. 
But since I put the money into BTC first, it grows as it sits there waiting to be converted to gyft cards. 
Gyft has allowed me to make money (or at least save a lot) in groceries.

I'll bite. I pledge that if the price of a ModelS is 1BTC or less, I will buy one.

I really like this. One of the reasons I initially started with BTC was for online poker, but I feel most of them are incredibly shady. 
I really appreciate you doing this. Makes me feel a bit more confident in the legitimacy of your site.

To be fair... *everyone* who deals in digital goods should accept bitcions. 
With services like bitpay where they don't even have to deal in BTC at all (they just get the cash like a normal sale) there's really zero reason NOT to accept BTC. Other than fear of the unknown.

So... what did you do to become high risk? Did you try and do a whole bunch of transactions in a short amount of time? 
I've used coinbase for 10+ transactions and never had an issue. Honestly, I was amazed when I bought at 550 and they jumped to 800 and coinbase didn't cancel on me. 
I'm really curious about what defines a "high risk" situation to them. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:33:53
Honestly, I'm not crazy about the hole in the square. If that were changed, I'd gladly pay 10~20 USD for one.  
(No idea what material and labor costs are for something like that, I'm just basing that off of the idea of having a badass bitcion keychain. :P)

I really want Matt to address the merchant aspect. I feel like this is something that media doesn't understand. 
I know he briefly touched it in a previous video, but most media I see has this fear that merchants are getting screwed by taking bitcions. They are assuming that bitcoins are going to a merchant who is just holding them and risking devaluation. 
What they don't understand, is that merchants aren't getting BTC at all, sites like bitpay get the BTC and merchants get their USD. To the merchant it's just another way to get USD into their account. (often with far less fees than credit/debit)

100?! Wow. If people would pay that, then go with that for sure!! If you're selling a product, you should get as much as people are willing pay. 
Sadly, I think that would put one of these out of my grasp. &gt;&lt;  (at least for now)

Props to Matt. 
His 12 days of bitcion has earned a lot of journalistic respect from me. I feel like a lot of the media around bitcion has been financial professions who simply refuse to entertain that something different could have merits. 
Meanwhile Matt is actually involving himself with bitcion. He's not just looking at it and comparing it against his experience then disregarding it. He's actually going through the motions to try and genuinely understand it. 
Even in the interview, I get the feeling the interviewer was pretty mocking and disregarding towards bitcion because it's different.

That's awesome. It makes me so happy to see people getting on board with BTC.
