Just applied through your website for our dog rescue based in Southern California. We focus on rescuing dogs with special needs that are often found at high-kill shelters and about to face euthanasia.
We're 100% volunteer based and put all our resources in to rehabilitation for the animals, and finding them their permanent homes.
Thanks for being a super human, this is truly an incredible thing you are doing.

Oh wow, super fascinating. Although the technical stuff is over my head, the concept there seems pretty strong and well beyond what I was meaning with just a simple thumbs up.
Was this received well when first published? Am I seeing correctly that it's still active and being worked on?

I thought that next time round was supposed to be today...?

Exactly the kind of answer I'm curious about. So much angst in your words!

Totally understand the goings on, but more how it correlates to each subreddit. Are you saying more miners live on one sub / users on the other?

Except go on there right now and you'll immediately find someone saying the exact same thing about SegWit / LN supporters over here. Still lost haha.

r/BTC seems to be on permanent attack mode compared to here. I'm more of a "hey, we're on the same team" person so maybe here is where I'll chill. Thank you for the inward looking moment u/zetsyuk

Thanks for the resources, Earth.

You go on Coinbase or equivalent to buy some currency. What actually happens behind the scenes when you turn fiat currency in to crypto?

Yeah I was wondering about this. Everyone always mentions Gemini on the 'Coinbase Fail' threads as being far more reliable, but I wonder if that's also just because it's dealing with a lot less traffic.
