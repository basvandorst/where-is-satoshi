**I am being censored with false downvotes. Please read the evidence provided.**
*edit: considering is now banned, I think it is obvious I was not lying.*
14 upvotes at 65% before even being approved.
Isn't that odd?

Edit: As I already told you, you do not understand how Reddit works. Reddit is not that easy to game and has systems in place to counter fake upvotes. You clearly tripped it.
Learn how Reddit works?
Read the rules? 


You literally admitted to breaking the rules.
Please check the thread everyone. You seriously think moderators are paid off?
Trying to take advantage of reddit for traffic is not cool, and is everything wrong with our community right now.
Also your story does not follow still. Your Twitter has ~7k followers. You're telling me you got 20 upvotes from them, but the tweet itself got 1 engagement? That's clearly not true.

**How about you stop censoring me with fake downvotes?** Ease up.

Against? It's obvious the manipulation is for.

More brash accusations. Nobody is brigading you. simply doesn't take kindly to this crap.
is Paxful.
The only thing [he's submitted is a video]( about EasyBitz.com, which after a little bit of research, is Paxful's former company name!
I'm calling you out too because you are AGGRESSIVELY manipulating the community.
Not to mention you are also banned for likely participating in the fake upvotes.

I've seen enough companies try to garner users here by schilling with fake upvotes. 
I don't care for Paxful, but I do care for breaking reddit. I've never even used Paxful, but noticed oddities in their previous posts.

It's extremely deceitful of you to continue vote manipulating comments, and make yourself out to be the victim here.
try not to be persuaded here, this is very slick and quite disgusting what Paxful is doing here. I urge you to objectively look into the evidence outlined.
You broke the rules, and I hope Reddit Administrators look into this.
**I am not a moderator, and this is not how you should react to being caught manipulating posts.**
