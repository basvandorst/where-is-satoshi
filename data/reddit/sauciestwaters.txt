Capital gains as an asset (short term less than a year/long term over a year) and % of profits paid depends on income bracket

Sometimes there is a major reason...
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:20:53
Volatility comes with any emerging/young market. It's easier to move smaller market cap and of course it's more of the wildwest in terms of manipulation. Even in the days of early internet stocks, there was massive volatility just not as much as crypto

Go from coin base to gdax for free transaction!
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:23:51

Brian Kelly has knowledge. Hes just wrong like all the time lol

Well most have less than a percent and you feel nothing, maybe calmess and relief from anxiety and others even around a 1% and I can def feel that. Cbd is actually synergistic with thc so its more effective for them to be together even in small amounts 
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:37:42
I would mine different coins 
@_date: 2018-08-04 03:00:16
Quit talking in definitives

Those two arent the CBOE..
@_date: 2018-05-02 05:59:08
I know haha
@_date: 2018-08-23 02:53:16
Yale study recently said everyone should have 6% of portfolio allocated to bitcoin 4% if naysayer, and 1% if you think it has no chance just for diversification purposes. They say since crypto is a non correlated asset it actually reduces your overall volatility
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:46:55
Its like a 200k minimum so retail investors arent part of it lol
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:44:41
Your crystal ball is broken bud. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 21:45:53
If you ever do this something like bitcoin.tax is incredibly useful to aggregate your trades from a ton of exchanges
@_date: 2018-08-24 21:48:42
For now... they are trying to make it so anything under (around $600) is not a taxable event. Which will in effect, make people want to use it more. Who would want to record endless coffee/food transactions or w.e as taxable events!

Write it off as a gift simple. If someone laters sells an appreciated asset then taxes must be paid on it

@_date: 2017-11-04 16:16:15
You gonna pay taxes m8?
@_date: 2019-10-05 18:13:16
Not true, it usually rises and recovers losses but doesn't actually pass the old all time high until after the halvening
 
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:27:00
Not as safe as a ledger (cold storage)
@_date: 2019-02-12 02:57:33
Like this doesnt happen in traditional markets.....
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:42:02
Dont buy right before the fork by plan lol only if it seems like a good place to get in. Ony reason to buy at an intentional ATH before the fork would be to get a stake in both chains

@_date: 2019-01-09 18:24:13
Well bitcoin.tax already has tons more exchanges..
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:07:52
Do any of you have bitcoincash? 
@_date: 2018-07-21 05:25:30
Around mid august unless delayed
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:58:13
Since many will be transferring their coins/fiat into bitcoin to get control of both coins 
@_date: 2018-07-21 05:38:17
Coinbase is great for beginners 
@_date: 2018-07-29 15:36:50

Do not send back. Common scam, also move lol!
@_date: 2018-07-21 05:37:31
Bitcoin just dropped over 70 percent from its high. From a year ago its technically high, but right now its been kind of a blood bath. Aka a fantastic time to get in, even if it drops more in the next few months, just wait :) 
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:55:58
If you look at the charts for btc, from every last peak/high, the next peak is on average 500% higher and from the lows over 10x higher. In the past you could have bought at every peak and still have done extremely well. I believe the same will be so soon 
@_date: 2018-07-19 23:35:08
@_date: 2019-05-05 00:33:30
What? There is a coinbase app lol.
@_date: 2019-05-20 06:33:56
Robinhood isnt actually free due to the spread lol
@_date: 2019-05-20 06:35:58
.15% very reasonable. I pay about 2 bucks for 1k purchase
@_date: 2019-05-20 06:34:47
Send your money prior only use coinbase pro.  .15% aint bad! On 1000 dollars I pay a couple bucks
@_date: 2018-12-31 04:44:46
You go down harder but bounce back way more.. soo
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:34:45
Use coinbase pro. Its barely anything compared
