What are the chances that scammers are just robin hoods?  They come from a poor country and hacking exchanges allows them steal from the rich and give to the poor?  Sure there's no guarantee this is the case, but the probability is not zero. And sure, not everyone who has money on the exchange is rich.  Rich is relative.  Would you say most people who invest in bitcoin are living more comfortable lifestyles than those dying and can't escape a corrupt nation?

$2960 for which is 7.5 % below  last year's $3200 (hoping for a 2014 to 2015 kind of movement).  (I'd like to stock up some more at a low price before it goes to the moon)
