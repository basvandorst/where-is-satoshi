Can Lightning Network really save Bitcoin when the technology also works on other Blockchains where opening/closing payment channels will actually be affordable?

@_date: 2017-12-18 22:55:11
I'm not an expert on this and zwei_und_zwei is probably right. 
I heard that the transaction can be resubmitted to mempool anytime. So you should make a transaction that renders the unconfirmed one invalid or eventually it might be confirmed someday although you don't want that anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:09:33
How about we stop blaming them for Bitcoin being barely useable? How about we stop pretending there wouldn't still be a big scaling issue even if they implemented SegWit?

@_date: 2017-08-15 18:15:55
Does it though? Every other Crypto being very similar to Bitcoin is close enough.
Imagine another Crypto taking the dominance some time in the future or even value spreading more equally amongst all the currencys. I think that would cause a huge blow to Cryptocurrencys as a whole.
If i had to fear that a cryptocurrency could lose in the competition and lose marketshare that would make them MUCH less convenient in use. The risk of storing value in crypto would be too big for my taste.

I agree for most people it's not user friendly enough rn.

The green (or red) marker to the right shows if it's an incoming or outgoing transaction. If you take the TransactionId and search it on [Blockchain.info]( you can see for yourself if it is confirmed yet or still pending. Bread shouldn't take long to sync once it was included in a block.

Idk if its cool with the TOS but you don't need to show an ID to use Poloniex for just that.

It wouldn't help really. Either way he loses most of the dust due to fees during the first on-chain transaction. Whether that txs opens a channel or goes to his other wallet directly, doesn't matter.
Also with the LN approach to end up with the coin in his new Airbitz wallet it would require a second on-chain transaction eventually. correct me if i'm wrong there, not an expert myself.
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:47:13
They seem to ignore this request everytime i send feedback.  I think they are pretty proud already that there are two fee options to choose from in the new beta version.

There was that thing about a YouTuber that was defamed by just picking certain comments out of context to craft some tabloid shit. He used politically incorrect language or something. That didn't look like a great piece of work from the outside.

@_date: 2017-10-31 23:20:44
The Breadwallet is generally good. I'm very satisfied with the App and the stance of the dev team.
What step are you stuck on? Is the Wallet syncronizing or is the state of the transaction "in progress" altough it is already confirmed on the blockchain?
I do not own a Hardware wallet but i'm sure you do not need Breadwallet or any other wallet to use it.
edit: In the settings you can manually trigger the wallet to syncronize. Also make sure to use automatic mode to connect to a node or choose a different node.

How is this managed upon closing a channel since we cannot settle half a satoshi on chain? Will the channel stay open and leave some dust on each end?
edit: should have checked your links beforehand. So it's rounding down huh thats spicy.. and i still wonder where does the rest go then?

Not exactly what you want probably but i use [Bitcoinwisdom]( to check price.
If you just zoom out as far as necessary the ATH should be marked and visible. Choose whatever exchange you like, i usually observe Bitstamp.
edit: i know you specificly didn't ask for a graph but it has an arrow with a number pointing to the High :P

Well Sido ended up making music for the mainstream at least.

Bitcoin is on TV and in the paper. Shows like Sillicon Valley and Big Bang Theory shot an episode featuring Bitcoin. Songs are written about it.. and you are still not satisfied? :)

I did this recently because Breadwallet didn't fit my needs. [Here is how i got my keys.](
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:29:28
Yes, i recently used it to switch from Breadwallet to Electrum because BW wouldn't let me set a custom fee. In fact now i can manage my coins on both wallets, what ever i feel like.
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:40:39
Do you really think so? I think BitPay pay USD to steam, so steam doesn't have to take a risk by accepting BTC.

Peter Todd look a bit like a Hobbit on this photo.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:38:15
If it's no problem for you that the transaction takes up to a day to confirm you can choose to lower the fee quite a bit i think. 
For example 10sat/B probably works and is enough to use the transaction accelerator just in case.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:20:13
First of all what do you mean by "withdraw from electrum"? Is electrum not your private wallet.. where do you want to withdraw to?
The fee that you pay is 100% a miner fee. Electrum doesn't charge you anything.
You can enable custom fees in Electrum, so you can set whatever fee you like. Check the settings it's somewhere.

You just need to write down the recovery phrase and keep it somewhere safe. The recovery phrase enables you to open a wallet that controls your addresses with a lot of different wallet clients. In case someday Electrum might be not available you just pick another one and recover your wallet there.
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:18:37
Really!? Well that would be great! I don't see whats so problematic about adding advanced settings or smth but it seemed they want Breadwallet to stay as simple as it can be.

Inches? uhu and about how many feet was the last crash??
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:40:45
Which website is it? What do they offer?
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:52:05
Ya i feel you. I recently learned from a friend that the fees on coinbase are quite hefty. I had no idea.
I have no experience with any exchange yet so unfortunetly i can't recommand anything else.
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:11:38






That goes for bip148 too... the hypocrisy on here. Hurr Durr boycott that and that and that too...
@_date: 2017-06-24 08:12:14
No way of putting your money into bitpay? 
Usually you choose bitpay as payment method, then bitpay tells you how much bitcoin that purchase will cost and gives you an address to send the bitcoin to.
Bitpay is just an intermediary you don't need an account or anything afaik. Just a bitcoin wallet to send the coin to the address you are given. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:13:34
Breadwallet does not allow custom fees, you have no control over fee when sending a transaction whatsoever. I wanted to send a big transaction and did it for 1/10 of the fee Breadwallet suggested using Electrum.
Now whenever i want to sign a message or send a tx i use Electrum. Breadwallet i use only for monitoring now.
Edit: One thing to keep in mind is that my Electrum wallet can't control any address i start to use later on. I opened my Electrum wallet only with the private keys of addresses i already used.

I didn't have the balls to sell, maybe i was a bit too lazy as well.. who knows how much further it might go up right?  
I really should've sold lul. Another big reason i just keep hodling is that i don't wanna fuck with exchanges because reddit makes me paranoid.
@_date: 2017-06-24 08:27:26
If Steam doesn't show Bitcoin as a payment option in the client at all then i'm afraid i can't help sorry.
