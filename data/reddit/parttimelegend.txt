The following is one man's opinion on bigger blocks.
We need bigger blocks but we need cheaper storage. I run everything from solid state drives. This means that the block size increase will consume my small storage medium almost instantly.
Now if we go with blockchain.info to hold the chain then we are looking at a single node telling us what's in a block.
I assume minds greater than mine are coming up with solutions to storage and transactional volume. However until the two can marry I see no hope for running full nodes.
@_date: 2015-12-16 22:39:11
One of the biggest issues we have is the increase in block chain size with the proposal to have larger blocks.
Considering that most people use cloud storage for things and 256 gb SSD is pretty standard. We don't have the space as a community. This leads to centralised nodes.

If you're looking to hold a large amount for a long period of time I would recommend a physical wallet.
Paper encased in UV glass filled with neon will easily last. 
Now Bitcoin is an experiment. Who knows if it will be around in 20 years?
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:39:23
If I'm making a transaction then I expect to pay fees.
The problem is that coinbase used to absorb this in their processing fees for purchases.
Now that blocks are pretty full, miners are controlling the fees. You set a low fee and it just isn't going to get mined.
It is absolutely clear to everyone that bitcoin is having scaling issues related to block size.
I'm a long ago miner. It is not feasible to be a miner now. I'm a user, who is bound by the limitations.

If I'm honest, I'm not even sure. I don't store in a single address, wallet. I have been using paper wallets for a long time.
@_date: 2012-12-31 11:20:20
The main reasoning behind using a  separate wallet in store is to avoid unnecessary fees. Whilst the fee for bit pay is low, it soon adds up and eats into profit.
Also it avoids the all eggs in one basket scenario.

I've been interested in Bitcoin for quite a while now and when hired to create the new online store for a friend's shop I couldn't resist the urge to set up Bitcoin as a payment option.
I'm using Bit Pay to process the payments as I can then convert to physical cash as required.
I seek a little advice. I'm looking to offer payments in store too. My current plan is to have block chain handle the wallet with the mix of android and iOS devices set to allow the control of currency. How many confirms do you think are suitable as I don't want to waste people's time.

I actually went and read that article after you mentioned it.
So let's swim is a dark net market retailer. Instead of using a tumbling service, they are essentially faking one by moving the coins around a lot, sprinkling in some innocent bystanders addresses to create plausible deniability about the origin or ownership of the coins.
Assuming at the end the coins end up on an exchange, are not all coins tainted to the exchange and therefore the person behind the account? I understand that Bitcoin has taken off massively in the last two years, but I don't think you can buy neckties in Colombia with it just yet.
Let's say I have 1 Satoshi in my few hundred coins. Can I trace that specific 1 Satoshi back to its origin? I know I can see the incoming transaction of say 5BTC. But I want to trace that 1 part. I can't see a way to navigate the block chain to that level.

Tattoos are made by implanting ink under the dermis layer off the skin. In the west this is primarily done with the use of a tattoo machine, this is an electronic device that drives the needle up and down at speed depending on the artist's settings.
If this person used a liner for the entire tattoo it just leads to my labeling of them as a scratcher.
Regarding the text, I know artists personally who can and have done more intricate pieces.
Then we look at cost. I mean 1.84 is still less than $100. Did we fail to remember the old adage, you get what you pay for?

I require everyone over at to lend me their palms to sooth my face.
Looking at this piece makes me wonder where it was done. Not to get one of my own, but to make sure I never step foot in their studio.
The lines look like they were drawn by a 2 year old with Parkinson's and too much sugar in them whilst riding in a barrel rolling over rough terain.
The letters are not evenly spaced or sized. The whole tattoo is disproportional.
The B is an abomination to this art. It doesn't line up with the text, the lines again! Oh God the lines!
Now the key! How can someone with a tattoo machine and presumably a licence can make this mess? Could they not draw a marker line to keep it level? I know they are trying to represent the upper and lower case elements at different levels, but I just want to vomit.
If you can name and shame the "artist" I will make it my goal to arrange for them to meet some real artists and get correct training. Though to be fair, this scratcher did such a bad job I don't think the work can be salvaged. Too large for a cover-up, I'm thinking we start a fund to donate to this man's laser date.

Can you provide the transaction id?
Did you pay a fee?
Does it have multiple inputs making it a large size transaction?
A month is a long time for a transaction to not confirm. This implies there is a deeper issue. A common issue is where one of the inputs is a double spend against you. This means the transaction contains coin you don't actually have. The blockchain can get a bit confused when this happens.
If it's a case of a valid transaction someone can likely manually mine it for you if you ask nicely.
@_date: 2013-03-27 03:05:39
You should go with bitpay. I've used them setting up local merchants in my city.
You can do it on his phone so long as he has a data connection. They are fast and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.
As it's a large transaction I would look to wait for a few confirmations on the transaction. Six is deemed irreversible however I would be more inclined to say two would be fine. That's approximately 20 minutes.

Welcome to the revolution.
Bitcoin is as complex as you allow it to be. In an explain like I'm x way it works like this.
You have an address that starts with a 1. That's like your email address. If I know it, I can send you bitcoin.
You have something that looks like your address that starts with a 5. That's your password. Don't tell anyone it, not even your mother. If you lose your password, you lose your address and anything in it.
Now wallets are a misnomer. Think of it as a list of passwords. Those are the ones that start with a 5. Each is the password for a new address that starts with a 1.
You want to keep these passwords safe. So it's recommended to keep them backed up.
A few good things to know if you want to use bitcoin without much effort there is a fantastic site at blockchain.info. You can register here and they will hold your wallet for you. You don't have to remember anything but your password for the site. They even backup your wallet for you to email, dropbox, etc.
I actually printed my wallet to paper that's sealed in an airtight opaque container that is locked inside a safe that I can't access myself. This prevents anyone demanding I hand it over even under threat.
There is a lot more to bitcoin. Just learn the basics and you'll do fine.

Here the homeless can get a job selling magazines.
They must buy the magazine at £1 and sell at £2.
I wouldn't read it so I'll give a friendly one the money, but leave the magazine. The money is inconsequential to me.
Say you have 100 magazines. You sell all at face value and then you have £200. That's a pay of £100 a day.
Now factor in say 5% don't want the magazine. This means that 5 sales are 200% profit as you can sell the magazine twice. That's an additional £20.
Your earnings are now £120 a day. Now let's see, tax? No. National insurance? No. That's £220 in your pocket with a float of £100 reserved for tomorrow.
Let's now consider that some people coming out of stores have some small change on them, no use to them so they do the charitable thing and give it to the homeless as they need it more.
Let's call this 50p on average and 10 people do this. That's an extra £5.
Most areas have soup kitchens / Catholic missions to help feed and cloth the homeless. Say you get a blanket and some food for free each night. You still need to eat during the day. A lot of small coffee stalls donate coffee and old food to the friendly homeless. So no cost there.
Now we have to look at accommodation. Homeless doesn't always mean sleeping on the streets. The YMCA here charges £8 a night for homeless residents. Take that from your £125 and you're left with £118 a day profit.
Wonder why the homeless turn to drugs and alcohol? Same reason rock stars and rich kids do. They need to do something with all the money.

Syncing and reindexing seem scary words. I truly believe bitcoin needs a friendlier language use for a lot of things.
Syncing is when you're downloading the blockchain. This is the big book of addresses and money. It's updated constantly, so you are always syncing. Just the blocks you haven't got, which are like pages in the book. Obviously you need the whole book so far to begin with.
Now the reindexing is because your machine crashed. Still thinking of the book, imagine you printed the book out and dropped it! Oh no, your pages are everywhere. You need to collect the pages you have and put them in order. It might take a little while, but fortunately for you your machine will do this for you.
Just wait it out. If you know your address you can look it up on blockchain.info to make sure you have the coins.

Silk Road is one of the biggest benefits/issues for bitcoin adoption.
You see the thing with bitcoin is it's meant to be a currency. It's like digital cash.
You can spend cash in most places. You can spend bitcoin in very few. So if you're new to the concept the first thing you will find is people talking about a marketplace. It's not money till it has a marketplace. So we must accept silk road as a marketplace.
So it leads to the discussion that goes like this "bitcoin is an amazing digital currency. It's completely decentralised so there is no authority. If anything you are the authority for your coins. It's the future." "I looked into it, but I don't want to buy drugs so it's no use to me."
I've never purchased anything from silk road. This isn't because I disagree with it, it's that I have no interest. I believe that your body is your own and that no nation state should restrict what you can do.
The publicity of silk road tarnished the reputation of bitcoin. It also led to an increase in adoption. After the Gawker article price went up.

Confirmations are pretty simple if you understand blocks.
A transaction is confirmed when a miner solves a block containing the transaction.
The first confirmation is the block that contains the transaction. The second and the nth are subsequent blocks solved after the block the transaction was in. They have no control over the transaction, they sit atop of the old block.
Each new block solidifies the existing block. If a block is found by others to be invalid it can be orphaned. This means it's not included in the blockchain. You can't go back and orphan the genesis block, you can only go back so far. The idea that six confirmations is a solid base.
A block is designed to solve every ten minutes.
I'm seeing a lot of large value with small size transactions taking over an hour to confirm.

Giving me a bitcoin card issued by your company that I load my coins to and spend in stores that have your hardware is centralisation.
Bitcoin is freedom from central governing. It is digital, people need to stop trying to make it physical.

Looking at your service you raise a few flags to me.
Your home page says that you never share data with anyone. Obviously you do to place the order, else where would it go? Just makes me wonder what else you overlook.
You delete data after order upon request. If not requested, how do you store data and for what purpose and time?

There was a block mined solo in 18 seconds. It contained no transactions at all apart from the block reward.

My hot wallet is blockchain.info paired to my phone.
I have bitcoin qt on my development machine for testing things.
I have about 50 paper wallets. Most are empty and are for emergency dumps of currency or tipping someone.
If I met you in person to buy coins. I would pull out a paper wallet and then have you send to that.
If you meet me to buy coins I will load a paper wallet at the time of travel and allow them to scan the public key to see it is loaded. Take the cash and ensure they have swept the balance.
This way my hot wallet is not publicly revealed. If an attacker tried to steal my phone it would be at least 30 minutes before I could kill it.
I have a paper wallet on my wall at home for savings. The private key in a safe.
I will try to use the tumbling service of blockchain.info on occasion to obfuscate the coins taint. So that they are not easily tracked and people can't work out where they came from or went.
@_date: 2013-01-25 22:54:06
You mention nothing that would make me want to invest. You have a bunch of qualifications, suspiciously large at such a young age.
If you run this large advertising network of yours with this modest revenue. Then surely you have a team of developers working with you.
The 4m turnover. How much was profit? You mention a partner in the thread. You are offering a 50/50 split with the developer, does your partner hold share equity? Is it even a registered company?
You make no mention of your name, advertising company's name or anything to backup your claims. You are asking someone to commit time and money to this venture with nothing of value to offer to them.
My advice is to go away, create a business plan and a traceable funding source. Then advertise the position and hold in person interviews. You can hire a developer this way, but be prepared to offer cash rewards. We all need to eat and a company with no new ideas and no cash isn't going to buy me food.
For these reasons I'm sorry, but I'm out.

What do you want at the end?
By this I mean Canadian dollars, fish or bitcoin.
If you want bitcoin then you can easily create a system for managing this. If you look at the RPC specification for bitcoind you can create payment addresses for each account and have them paid to.
If what you want is cold hard cash backed by Canada's finest. Then you will want to deal with a payment processor for the easiest option. You can use coinbase or bitpay. They both have an API and documentation to work with.
You are asking what you should use for the website. Are you looking for a way to integrate or a complete web solution?

Depends what you buy. Also worth is subjective.
Can I use a desktop whilst sat in the airport? On a train? Taking a dump? Sat in a coffee shop?
So 30 BTC is about £1,500. My last laptop was £1,280 so the price range isn't to far off.
As I develop software I need a machine capable of the job. So high clock speed and. A minimum of 8 gb of ram.
I know that you will never get the desktop equivalent power in a laptop. The additional cost for me is worth it for the convenience.

Before closing the scam you take a few extra marks
@_date: 2013-02-21 23:06:35
Say you earn $30k a year. That's 10k BTC at current rate.
If you agree to have 30k as salary with it paid as 10k you are alright. If you agree to be salaried at 10k BTC it's a tough gamble. If bitcoin takes off massively in value like many here hope/believe then you could potentially increase your earnings drastically.
A safer and wiser move would be to accept a 30k USD salary with a percentage paid in bitcoin.
I can't pay my mortgage in bitcoin, I don't think my bank have any real interest in this being an option.

@_date: 2013-03-02 03:02:23
Let me check, one second. Okay, I've checked. This isn't 1993 and the internet has evolved. With it user acceptance has changed.
Bitcoin is an internet commodity. At the present moment you will struggle to find many places to send it in the real world.
This means people expect a certain artistic flair to internet systems.
I'm a developer and the number one thing that causes user acceptance testing issues for me is when they start on about different shades of a colour or making some text bigger. You can't show people bad design now and expect them to buy in to it.

After recently forking the code by mdszy and learning to play around with Ruby a little, a language I had been wanting to learn for a while. I decided that I would deploy my own faucet.
It's non-profit, in as much as it has ads and receives donations that go into the pool to be paid out. I do not take any cut at all of the pot, it all goes to users.
The ads all payout automatically into the faucet so it *should* be self funding.
If you are richer than I and wish to donate, you can send tips to 1GNCie7qmDKvPHhHmVmqpYHkY689Xx3wkU.
Obviously the faucet doesn't pay till it has funds. So I've arranged for some to be sent to it.

What I was trying to say is that I expect the price to crash. Then the waiting buy orders to push it back up again.
I don't expect bitcoin to replace fiat. It can't. It's not scaleable enough. The block sizes are too small and the hard limit too low to replace real world money. I would like to see some high street retailers taking bitcoin, as it would increase interest.

I still don't think wallet is the right term for bitcoin really.
In software terms a wallet is a collection of private keys generated and stored with a connection to the network.
A paper wallet is the idea of a non electronic storage. You can't hack a piece of paper. You can hack a computer/printer/website though.
I used wget -m 100  and then removed my network card. I then did a sweep of my home for electronics transmitting signal (camera, microphone, bugs, etc).
Now I booted a Linux distro from dvd (worm media) and I ran the copy of the site.
I created a chunk of 99 paper wallets with 3 per page with the logos. This output was then saved to an Sd card plugged into printer that was not on the network and printed.
Once printed the sd card was destroyed to prevent forensics.
The printer costing enough to keep was reset a number of times with a firmware flash in addition. It was powered off and left as such for a week.
The computer was then shutdown, network card and hard drive reinstated and booted back to Windows. A full scan of the system was then performed to check the integrity of all files.
The only place these public and private keys exist are on the sheets of folded paper in my pocket, safe, other locations. I regularly save a wallet with value in a bundle of empty ones. This just limits the view of anyone finding a bundle finding one with value.
I'm not saying you need to be this paranoid. I'm just saying that they are after someone and it could just as well be you.
@_date: 2013-03-02 01:14:44
Well you need to consider the risk vs reward.
Is someone going to try and compromise your machine for a few satoshis? Probably not.
Is someone going to write a Trojan that tries to import your unencrypted wallet and spend all the funds to their address. Of course they are. It's not even that hard to do, considering the documentation and source is already available from the bitcoin git. You just need to implement it and you're away.
There is also the argument that all wallets are vulnerable. Be them brain, paper or other.
I built my paper wallets from bitaddresd.org copied to my machine. Hard drive and network card removed, booted to a live OS from DVD and generated and printed.
I have the public key on my wall at home. If I get a large chunk of coins I just scan and send. It's my savings fund. I've got no plans to withdraw it, until I need it.
@_date: 2013-02-18 22:28:00
The price will crash in the next month I would say. As there are so many people set to buy it will force the price back up.
The best thing to crash the price is to shake confidence. If a large scam/hack occurs it will shake confidence and panic selling will occur.
At the moment bitcoin still has little intrinsic value. My bills are paid in fiat and my food is bought with it.
I cannot buy these things today with bitcoin without an intermediary. This devalues a currency by acceptance.
I would expect a crash to $18 before April. I'm always willing to be proved wrong though.
@_date: 2013-03-21 12:31:03
Unfortunately this company receive so much bad press on here that I cannot understand why they continue to operate.
I understand that they are the payment processor for Reddit gold so they have a vested interest in this community.
Now I have dealt with financial risk management systems before. The details I would be checking would be buying patterns, ip changes, geo location and time of day as a first step. If you live in a country where it's 4am and you're logged in from Nigeria I would flag as suspicious.
This high risk stuff seems more like high risk of them losing profit. If the price jumps dramatically, then the risk is to them.
For everyone who posts publicly there must be others who just accept their fate.

That's not a very large budget. To create a large scale project you need a large budget. You can eat though that in a single day of an advertising campaign.
What I want and I would pay for is so simple.
I have shares in various companies in various markets globally. I have bitcoin, USD, GBP, EUR and some other currencies. I have several bank accounts and savings bonds and investments.
I pay a lot of people in different ways.
I can currently manage everything online through a separate website for each.
What I want is a service that will combine the whole lot.
At the push of a button I want to see how much I have everywhere. I want to push another to send money anywhere. Convert one currency to another. Invest in a market, sell shares.
When I buy something, prompt me to submit a receipt for record.

From a technical perspective it sounds like you are in over your head.
You talk about using existing hardware. I can't see my bank issued PDQ being happy with this idea, they say what cards they accept not me. It's not my property, so I can't just hack it. It doesn't support this cryptographic key system you were discussing. I'm English so mine doesn't even use magnetic stripe.

I would love to see more ways to spend bitcoin in my area. I have been working with a few small retailers to help them accept bitcoin as a payment option.
The problems are:
Unconfirmed transactions.
Try keeping a passenger while you wait for 6 confirmations.
Exchange rates.
What a bitcoin was worth this morning is not what it's worth now.
You are in a car with a stranger. You produce a valuable electronic and present it to them. I'd hate to see this go bad.
Possible solutions I have found.
Unconfirmed transactions.
Double spending is hard to achieve. I wouldn't worry.
Exchange rates.
Use bitpay or similar.
Paper wallet. Sign up at blockchain.info and add your address as a watch only. Then have the private key safe and the public on show in the cab. This then means you get confirmations however the coins are secure.

In the settings you can turn off fees. Just be aware that your transaction without appropriate mining fee can take some time to complete.
Alternatively blockchain.info let's you create an account and import your wallet.dat file during signup. 
You can then use send and custom.
I wouldn't go down the route of using your online wallet private key translated to paper. This means the key has been seen online and should your machine be compromised so is the key.
I have my main paper wallet on my wall in my lounge. Well the public key and I deposit to it regularly.

Whenever I visit blockchain.info and look at the transactions flying by I'm always annoyed by the volume of sd transactions diluting what I'm reading.
Unfortunately bitcoin is an open platform. We cannot ban an account from operating.
We also have to remember the role they have written e the foundation.
Now if we as the users took affirmative action to stop relaying their transactions it would be amazing to see. A collective movement to change the way the network moves.
It amuses me that we submit pulls to the qt client and wait for its release. We have the power to implement our own builds, why don't we? If the pull is rejected, build it yourself!

I couldn't care less about return on investment. As it stands, I have never traded a single coin for fiat nor have I bought any with fiat.
I don't see bitcoin as a way to increase my gold reserve or my local currency. I see it as investment in the future of a dream.
90% are in cold storage. I watch the wallet addresses for safety, I'd rather know. I have no more than 20 bitcoin per wallet. I don't know if I'm a millionaire or a poverty stricken beggar. I'll redeem coin when I need to. For now they are just scraps of paper that may change my life one day.

It is entirely possible.
Many will argue that it would take billions of years. This is ultimately not true.
They bass this argument on probability. A 1 in x chance is still a chance. If you generate 1 new address, there is a chance no matter how minute that it has been used before.
Fortunately the probability is so low that many see it as a negligible risk.

"Le bitcoin" ~ Ron Paul
@_date: 2013-02-28 00:38:20
Do you mean consolidate balances?
You don't really have to. This is where the magic happens.
If you consider internet banking. You want to pay me x. You have y in account z and a in account b. You need to move y from z to b or a to z from b. Now you can send x to me.
With bitcoin so long as all your accounts/addresses are in one wallet you can send x to be and it will automatically take y from z and a from b. This means you have two inputs to the transaction.
You can of course consolidate your balances to one address. Just be aware that doing so will increase transaction fees.

The issue I see for you are two:
Payment: whilst I have coins, my parent's, many friends don't. I tell them to get some cheese from a site, they expect card details to be taken. Oh that Bitcoin thing they were on about? Looks complicated. I'll give it a go. So I download software that takes hours to be ready to use, then I register on another site and then I pay them. Now I have coins I can send to myself! I wait for confirmed transactions? An hour! I now have coins to spend. What was that site again? Oh. I'm going the shop.
Vanity/Ego: If you make a product that people want you want to tell people about it. How else would they know? Hey Joe you should tell people to buy my cheese, but don't tell them it's from me. Hey x Joe told me about your cheese. I checked out the site and I couldn't figure out how to pay. Can I give you cash? Soon everyone knows about it.

The bitcoin protocol allows for a maximum of 21,000,000 coins to be generated.
Now assume that a chunk are lost forever from early adopters trying the system out and abandoning it as the coins had no value. Lost private keys from drive failures and the like. Coins sent to invalid addresses. Miners not claiming the reward in part or in full. It's impossible to know how much is lost forever, so I'll estimate 10%.
Now we have 18,900,000 coins available. Now they all all be mined by 2140. At which point current estimates on world population is 7,200,000,000.
Split evenly is 0.002625 BTC per person.
Now we look at the rich poor divide. If 5% hold 50% of the wealth. We are looking at orders of magnitude smaller for the average person to hold. Then we look at the poverty line and see people lower. We currently divide to the 8th decimal place. This is not feasible should bitcoin become the global currency.
Can you imagine doing a shop on 0.00000000000000000000000001 BTC?

I know it's off topic, I'm just curious.
Can you see outbound connections trying to retrieve the blockchain?
@_date: 2013-02-24 23:42:46
The blockchain shows all transactions that occur. To keep from holding a user's money and risk a security breach the funds are not kept for any longer than they must be.
In addition to this, by making all transactions public there is no accusation of fraud.
The delay in downloading the blockchain on a new install is unfortunately one of the biggest issues faced when trying to get new people into the eco system.
Unless SD decides to allow registrations, account deposits and withdrawals then they will continue to use the public ledger as a means to record transactions.
I've bet on SD twice I think. I won tiny amounts, and never felt the need to repeat. I was more curious to see how it worked.

The issue is that as the value of bitcoin grows so does the fee value, not in amount but in perceived value against the gold standard.
Say I am new and I get maybe 0.01 from some nice person. I want to send that 0.01 elsewhere and I'm asked to pay a 0.005 fee. That's half my fortune!
The fee may be small in comparison to other electronic transaction processors. I expect to see more and more people trying to get away with larger sized transactions in an attempt to bypass this fee or at least reduce it.
As I type this I have 7 unconfirmed transactions. The oldest of this is 6 days and is 11kb. The largest is from today and is 17kb. If the network requires fees, they should be mandatory, giving a person the option to include a fee will promote most people to withhold to save money.

Blockchain have a feature that allows for anonymous payments. This works via the generation of a new address that they control.

If eBay decided to ban the use of bitcoin, they could do so and are well within their rights. Just like you can smoke in your house, but not in mine. That's my house; my rules.
The argument can be made that if eBay forbid bitcoin they are being anticompetitive. They can simply say the lack of buyer protection offered by an irreversible pseudo anonymous payment method has been shown to lead to a large amount of online payment fraud. In this case they would be correct.
If you want to accept bitcoin do so. Just be prepared for the email saying not to do it anymore.

I actually created a basic faucet recently. I've not deployed it as it's my first foray into a new language and need to build some good unit tests as the base I forked was not built on test driven development.
The site runs two lots of ads. Those by anonymous ads and c coin url. These two ad accounts feed directly into the pool. They are the only source of funding and my estimates are on low value returns. I don't want to make a penny of this, all advertising revenue automatically pays to the faucet to pay to users.
That said the payouts I'll be offering are in the region of 0.00000050 per visitor. This is so low that it's considered dust.
You can't do anything with this amount.
The only way to make this faucet worth while to use would be to offer at least 0.01. Though as there are no advertisers offering anywhere near this level of payout and I don't want to pay in anything myself as there is absolutely 0 return for myself. I'll probably toss in a few tough, as I'm nice.
Free sites are never going to give you anything of real value. In fact most are a waste of time.
I did research them, in fact I wrote an application (no I won't publish it) that parsed the sites for their payout times and values and submitted each one. I did not do this through a proxy and I did not attempt to override any security (except captcha as they are annoying). I ran this for a month to the day, hour, minute and second. The returns were so low that their fiat equivalent was less than a dollar.
I donated the result to the foundation as I felt I had not earned it. It was more as a research project.

As the time between blocks is designed to be 10 minutes and difficulty is increased/decreased to try and force this. Mining is in fact complete luck of the draw.
If you only hashed in the last few seconds, it would be no more likely to solve than an hour before.
If a block is solved by a miner whilst you are still working on it. Then you solve it, your block is rejected and orphaned.
As most miners operate in pools that are share based rather than trying to solo mine. A miner would want to continually hash to generate shares.
The only delays would be those caused by the get work requests. Also if too much is passed to the miner to work on, that they are lagging behind. Also if block solve time is too fast then you can get more stale shares like you do with lite coin as the blocks are designed to be 2.5 minutes apart.

I have to send you 125% of the average bid to win. Say the average is 1BTC I send 1.25 BTC. You take your 0.005 cut meaning I will see a return of 1.245 should I lose and a 2.245 if I win.
Now say the average is 10 BTC and I send 12.5. After your deduction of 0.005% I stand to lose out as the amount increases.
Also as you are a single person with no real backing the issue of trust comes in to play.
The reward is too low to combat the risk.

It is not possible to guarantee that all nodes will be updated. However if the majority are and the chain forks only those who chose not to update will lose out. 
From a user perspective this shouldn't be that much of an issue as your broadcast to the network is received by a miner and included in a block.
The people who stand to lose out are the miners. If you are writing your blocks to the wrong chain and continue to do so, you will receive block rewards and fees that you cannot spend on the main chain.
Progress cannot always be backwards compatible.
If you are mining today it is a commercial venture and not a hobby. If you are mining against a daemon that you have had 2 months of warning needs to be upgraded then you deserve to loose out. This is bleeding edge technology, if you can't keep up then don't try.

You send emails? Bitcoin is email money. Not paper money with pictures of dead people on, it's electronic money just like email is electronic mail hence the name. It's not controlled by the banks, so you don't have to go to a machine to get money you can do it from your phone.
Bitcoin is made by a process called mining. It's where people like you and me have computers setup to validate transactions and make sure it's all secure. They are like the mint of bitcoin.
Now the big question. What can you do with it? Can I spend it in x shop on the high street?

While bitcoin is easily sent it's not so easily spent. This is the downside. 
I don't know why you sent your friend money. I'll use help with rent as an example.
Your friend needs money, you say you'll lend it. Now you wrote a cheque, mailed it and they got it and took it to the bank. It cleared and they could pay their creditors.
Turn around: ~5 days.
Now with bitcoin.
You have the coins at this point so no process for you to get them.
You send to them, 10 minutes later has then. Assuming we wait for 6 confirmations then we have an hour.
Now their creditor won't take bitcoin so we need to convert back to fiat.
Join mtgox and verify your details. With delays this takes about a week.
Now do a transfer which they claim is 3 days.
Total time: ~10 days.
Bitcoin is a currency in itself. Just like sterling and dollars. 
The secret to success is to transfer money effectively and within the same currency. They need dollars, send dollars.
Also could you not use bank transfer? I'm English and we have a faster payment system which means I can send money that is normally instant and at the most 15 minutes.
Bitcoin is not the replacement for fiat. It is an alternative for micro payments.

Every address has a key. So if you have multiple addresses. You have multiple keys.
I probably have 20 addresses for different things. So I need to keep them all securely backed up.
Imagine 2 people want to buy something for 2 bitcoin a piece. The first pays and the second doesn't. How do you know who paid? If they have separate addresses to send to, then you can see which was paid.
If you visit bitaddress.org you can see addresses being generated. The site gives you the public and private key, you can create as many as you wish.
The site is designed for creating paper wallets just like you saw someone tip with. However for learning purposes it will show you the relationship between the public and private keys.
You can have as many addresses as you can be bothered to create. The mathematics behind the addresses deals with orders of magnitude larger than the universe will ever have to deal with.
There is no record of addresses until they are paid any coins. So it's a string till you give it value.

The issue of expense with flattr is that you pay x a month. Now if you see an article you like then you flattr it. At the end of the month your subscription fee is divided by those you flattr.
Now say I pay $100 a month as I live for quality content. I'm happily going along clicking away and also publishing content of my own. End of the month I spent $100 and I earned say $20. That's a net loss of $80. That's $1k a year.
With a bitcoin implementation I see it like this.
1. Register account.
2. If publisher then add code to site else nothing.
3. You have been given an address to fund your account. If you want to tip people you need to fund your account.
4. Now you visit a site like what you see and you click to tip.
5. Tip is sent to publisher account.
6. Publisher wants payment they go to account and withdraw.
You could have instant payments, but this could potentially cause a lot of extra transactions in the blockchain.

Database is MySQL. What's the server side code in? What is the server running? A dbconnect class is so easy to do. I'd write you one for free.

What is the solution architecture? N-tier or a mash up?
Assuming you are on a lamp stack. Then the base work is easily done.
If you're on a wamp stack it's even easier. You could have the server code in a multitude of languages.

The Satoshi dice scam is such a simple one. I must admit I generated a dice vanity address once to see how it worked and it took seconds.

The best method for this would be local bitcoins. Arrange to meet people in public locations with no names.
Create a paper wallet, add the public key as a watched key on block chain to get notification.
Have a new paper wallet for each of the people you meet and leave them at home. Just take the public key.
Whilst this is a lengthy process as you have to meet a few people. The anonymity of various wallets and varying amounts and senders will help tumble the coins.
Make sure you leave the paper wallet at home or somewhere secure. Whilst people are generally good. I could imagine a sheet of paper with 2k would test anyone's moral standards. If you hold no coins, they can't be stolen.
