For France, your bank needs to declare to Tracfin suspicious activities. Two things :
- It's not illegal to send money abroad. Even 10k. But expect the fiscal authorities to keep an eye on you when money comes back.
- Your bank doesn't have to declare it if they think it is legit. If you have 500k on your saving account and wire 10k after calling your banker it's not the same as having 15k and moving 10k on a shadowy exchange at the other end of the world without notice. Since the bank is held accountable if you're caught laundering money, they tend to see suspicious transfers quite easily... :)

If you're more into readingn you can find the content of the OP's playlist in the following PDF. That's the paper based version of the lectures.

Wondering if they do it also in France. France doesn't allow chargebacks, so I guess it should still be free...

And if there isn't, there 100% will be.

Well this is how I've ended up with folders like "D:\Backup\BACKUP\toSort\Backups\My Documents\Save\misc" on my computer...
Still, according to my hard drive box I've owned more than 30 of them, and I know I've lost files over the years. So I won't call this guy shit... :)

No, you should be better than that.
We're all grown-ups, leveling down the debat just because it's fun is not what will make the crypto-community (if such thing exists) progress. :)

I give you a few years to use it then.

I did the same during summer 2016. Well amost, it was $30.
Now it's worth $400 and I regret not putting $5000 cash.   XD

It doesn't become a mandatory feature until all the nodes decide that it is. :)

Thanks for the tips guys. I'm gonna read all this.
Thing is, I don't live in France anymore + I have to factor in half a year of salary + rupture conventionnelle + trading. All this from Laos. Can't wait to be a non-resident in France. (When I see the taxes system in Laos, I will regret saying this...)

French here.
That's nice, but I still don't know precisely how I'm going to calculate what I need to declare... I mean when do we get an official note explaining how to do it? When will it come into effect? How do we declare for 2017?
Well, I have one month to find out... -__-
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:25:42
Too complicated given my situation and too expensive. :)

Tu crois qu'ils ont un whatsapp ? XD
Cela dit je dis des conneries, mais le Service Public à un super numéro avec des mecs hyper compétents derrière qui peuvent répondre à peu près à tout gratos (hors coût de l'appel). A défaut d'avoir le centre des impôts je peux tenter avec eux... :)

Je pense que j'ai vais au moins un A/R en 2017 avec une plus-value de plus de 5k (en FIFO). J'ai pas encore calculé ma plus-value sur 2017 (je suis une feignasse).
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:24:47
Great, thanks ! :)
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:25:24
Meh, it's going to be a pain sending this... But yeah I guess I'm gonna have to see which scenario is the best. Thanks for the tip.

Yes, but free water trickling down the wall for all the ACs above you.
