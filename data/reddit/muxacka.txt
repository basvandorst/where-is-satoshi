Ordered 2 device in Jan and till now nothing, it looks like a scam brewing with some pictures from time to time to reassure buyers and generate more scam as time passes by ...

Shift devices are not expanding neither on the coins supported nor on the resellers, it seems they are short on resources.
Halong mining with their new boost soft will disrupt the mining ecosystem 
Thanks for Icywallet :)

Frankly speaking Digital coins are "stored" on their respective blockchains, holding the PKs is simply like carrying your safe keys or bank account passwords.. legally speaking you are NOT crossing the border with any coins as again it is impossible.. it is a misconception from correlating in our minds a hardware or digital wallet to a regular fiat wallet that holds the Fiat bills..

Ok guys, most of you miss one important thing, the coins are not in the hardware wallet, the wallet has only the Private Keys. Legally speaking even if you are caught, they have no right to take anything as you did not pass the border with any coins.
The Bitcoins are on the Blockchain ledgers, the aggregation (sum) of all transactions of al addresses your seed generates constitute  your bitcoins balance.
And even if anyone tells you this is a bitcoin wallet, you can show that those are online, as you cannot see the balance without connecting to the ledger.. 
It is like carrying with you the keys to your safe.
The misunderstanding here is that we associate wallet to be the valuables holder..
So propagate this truth and destroy the Myth I see everywhere guys!..

Correct, however regardless, the hardware and software wallets need to be named anything but wallets as this drives ppl to think that the coins are stored there. Similarly these are not securities as you can access your coins from a backup.
