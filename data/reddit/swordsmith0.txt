Yeah. I don’t feel that its a good idea to encourage people to invest in things they don’t understand or know anything about. Educate them and them let them make their own decisions!

This yes 1000x. It might take a year, but this market of constant gains all the time *can not last*. Mainstream hype is driving the price, but the vast majority of these people do not understand what they are buying even on a basic functional level. A get rich quick scheme is not what should be associated with crypto.

Lighting creates chains between all users that opt for lightning transactions. Having one channel open with anyone will connect you to everyone else as long as people are using the network.

I don’t know about that. 90% of people I talk to about crypto have:
A: Bought a fair amount
B: Don’t have any idea how it works
C: Have no idea what it is or is for
When prices tank, my friends like this sell IMMEDIATELY. I assume this isn’t just people I know.

I bought in at ATH around 1k. Still hardly sold any. I believe in the tech long term and thats what I’m around for :)

I imagine its a combination of people selling their alts for btc before the split, as well as the increase in price causing more mainstream investors to jump on board. Just my thoughts :)

Nah I don’t advise that at all. Just speculating on why the price is increasing. I have no raw facts lol

I agree. BTC feels like a huge speculation, but other crypto feels like straight gambling lol
