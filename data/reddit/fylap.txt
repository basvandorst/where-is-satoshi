Do you have a lot of cats?

I think you misinterpreted my shitpost. I'm buying this dip, I'm looking forward to it :)

How do they work? Do I need to have my ledger with me or anything?

That Alfa Romeo price is in a bubble.

True story, Bitcoin used to be called "Yugoslav Dinar"

This made me lol while putting my kid to sleep and she woke up

Has anything been traced from those wallets related to today's price drop?
@_date: 2019-03-31 10:28:09
I've heard prophecies about people like you!
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:23:01
Yea, I've been thinking about that. I'm guessing the next dip will be a big one.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:18:49
I hope that how I feel in a few years time knowing that I got it at $4000 and $5000

Yea, I got into crypto this summer. All I knew was Bitcoin , then started reading more and found the likes of IOTA, VTC, XRP, etc. When I saw "Bitcoin cash" my first instinct was: "what a crap attempt at imitating / knocking off Bitcoin". Of course I read more about it, but definitely Bitcoin is the gateway drug for crypto.

I'm also hoping everyone who convinced their family during Thanksgiving to buy, that they should also just hodl and expect dips

Every time there's a new way of doing things old people cry foul and call for "going back to the way we've always done things"
I hope I never say those words when I'm old.

Is it a good strategy to take half of BTC and swap to BCH temporarily ... Idea being to increase my BTC position after selling on a BCH peak
I know people keep saying don't try to time the market but with this BCH growth I want to get in on it even though it may be temporary
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:04:14
Had I only known! :)
Likely to get pumped much further though?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:49:25
What's going on is this is a wild ride and I love it!!! God damn Bitcoin/crypto I love you.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:50:03
I'm guessing the mainstream is buying to get in on the profits. Not to buy their shoes with, so it shouldn't be too big an issue yet, no?
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:59:18
I am guilty of this too. I usually post this kind of crap to get a second opinion and to usually detach myself from the emotional side of trading

The FOMO is real!

What do Reddit Gold and Reddit Silver mean exactly anyway?

Man I love all these memes

Maybe she's not confused. Maybe she's rediculing you like every good wife should ;)
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:40:17
Wow that's a pretty big turn of events. 
I hope everyone's issues with this get settled quickly. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:30:42
I'm always surprised when I see BCh is still holding in There. It is the very definition of a scam

None of this information says it's undervalued. The information you've given is that people valued it way more and now it's returning to its true value... Aka, right side of graph.
@_date: 2018-12-25 12:43:26
Don't worry everyone, price fell because I bought yesterday
@_date: 2018-12-29 20:06:15
I agree with this sentiment... And don't get me wrong because I'm a long term HODLer 
But what data do you have to support that we're not in the latter half of this graph?
