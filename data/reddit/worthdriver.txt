Seriously? I'm surprised to see so much attention for a phishing email. I receive at least 2-3 of those from App Store and PayPal and never even had the thought of clicking on anything.

Sounds great

Well, I tried it, but don’t know whether to recommend it or not. I’d had some bugs on my mobile as well, but they disappeared after all

there is no doubt that BTC will keep on holding a leading position, especially taking into consideration these figures, but currently, I can't be sure in the further increase(
@_date: 2019-01-08 23:11:23
hah, I believe it should hide somewhere, in that bushes in this case

In fact, the list looks very impressively. This year was really eventful, I wish I would have been back in last winter. But it's really awesome, thank you

Hah, this is the best way to illustrate the situation on the market, especially taking into consideration the fact that this fence is very easy to get around) I hope that it’s not just for the time being 
@_date: 2018-12-24 21:43:53

@_date: 2018-12-19 02:34:07
It looks impressive, however it would be nice to see other pictures
