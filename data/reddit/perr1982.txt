They’ll back the banks, not bitcoin.

Lisk maakt het programmeren van blockchains heel eenvoudig omdat het voor javascript wordt gemaakt: de meest gebruikte en makkelijkste programmeertaal. In de loop van 2018 komt het product uit en vanaf februari komt de ‘rebrand’. Men verwacht daarvan hetzelfde effect als dat bij de NEO had. Die steeg van 5 naar 50 dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:12:06
Of beter nog: LISK. Gegarandeerd fors rendement in januari en februari!
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:17:35
4946,23 - but I might be wrong.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:25:13
Only a part of the people who got in too high hold - classic state of denial -, the other part is selling and is an important reason of the crash. People who got in at 1-2K are selling to take profit aswell. So it’s a garanteed downfall.
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:37:32
I’ve seen the level of discussion on this reddit go higher and higher...
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:26:28
What's with the dead cat? Look at the btc chart on July 17th. Same quick rise. This is bitcoin, not JP Morgan shares!
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:34:35
And so it did. And it failed the test...
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:15:13
I’ll get downvoted etc, but: yes I’m affraid it will drop a lot more.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:42:54
It ain’t dead, but it’s certainly very ill.
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:48:17
General direction is still down, I’m affraid. Should hit about 11K to reverse.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:48:52
Look at volume. Good indication for price development in the future. Btc volume is droping by the day.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:10:53
Nobody on wall street is going to put money in a coin which chart looks like a classic bubble bursting, trust me. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:33:22
Slow money will not invest in something that looks in everything like a bubble bursting. I’ve been in crypto since 2011 and I’ve sold most at 15K (still a bit too late). I’m seriously considering selling the last bits also.
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:22:44
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:25:08
Yes, but we can try to make a prediction what the rules will look like based on what we know. And I would say that a logical rule would not ban mining and permit OTC-transactions at the same time (although Chinese are not logical, but still :))
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:56:18
You should put the results in a chart. Might come in handy to predict the future price.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:47:44
Whole chart has a classic bursting bubble pattern; btc has been going down since 22 december. Wouldn’t invest until it hits 5K.
@_date: 2017-09-17 06:49:59
And a constant choir of Redditors singing 'Hodl' in the background.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:40:42
Where have you gained so much knowledge after five days in crypto?
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:21:24
No, but it has lately. Hence the question.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:42:58
This is what a deflating bubble looks like. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:53:03
It's Dimons daughter getting some more.
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:33:05
It was just a joke people. Still, I like the proposal.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:39:21
I fully agree. In addition: the propect of futures pushed the price up because it promised btc being accepted in the main stream financial world. But in fact futures often push the price down in the stock and commodity market. And as it turned out, the same happened in cryptoland but, as is typical for crypto, with huge force.
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:29:39
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:42:21
The state of denial...
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:30:06
It’s going to retest 6K first
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:02:24
Sold at 15K, thank god. This is going down fast.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:56:10
And who has a 25K credit limit??
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:42:48
Mr positive. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:10:47
It’s the price where mining is no longer profitable. That is a genuine fear I think, because the whole system could collapse if too many miners quit.
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:52:48
They keep coming up with Dimon as a cause for the correction, which is total bs. Cause was simply the Chinese uncertainty - stop giving the guy attention for things he hasn't caused. Nobody in crypto gives s. for his opinion.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:00:29
I don’t see any reason for more growth in the coming months. Clearly a bubble created by largely small investors. Sure btc and it’s tech have future, but since late december there has been only negative attention. Clearly not an atmosphere to attract more investors. I expect a very large dip towards 4000 or so.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:17:16
IMO this is different. The rise from 4 to 19 K has been caused by small investors seeking quick gains. Those people are always the first to flee the market. So I wouldn’t be suprised if btc fell back to 4 or 5 K in the coming month(s). 
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:20:13
Nope; get yourself a monthly subscription for 99 cents. It's worth knowing Chinese news fast.
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:41:38
Yeah that’s something I see happening too, but I’m waiting for a serious uptrend, before getting in again. A general uptrend might generate positive media attention - which would be nice for a change - and will start attracting new and old investors. That could give a new spike. Getting in now is a complete gamble IMHO.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:31:52
Yup, same here. My crypto-you-will-never-have-to-work-again-adventure started out with a huge loss.
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:49:38
Yeah, happened to me a couple of times. Also with sell orders.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:12:19
It sure is.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:42:11
It ain’t dead, but it certainly ill.
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:54:42
I don’t really see why it is a good thing that ‘short money’ is leaving. To get the value back up, money should pour in. Where do you expect that to come from?
Edit: pour
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:19:47
Could be, but the uncertainty is there to stay.
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:51:37
The English version of Caixin is pretty clear it does not affect bitcoin:
“It means platforms facilitating trading between virtual currencies and legal tenders will not be allowed in China,” the source said. But the source added that the crackdown targets unauthorized trading at virtual currency exchanges, rather than Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:38:19
I know; quit my job and now bitcoin is letting me down...
@_date: 2017-09-17 07:37:32
I only place selling orders at 40000 in case you accidently add a zero too many.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:35:05
The guy just gives proper advice and all he gets is filth... I’m disappointed that this reddit has come this far. (Although a couple of hunderd is of course unrealistically low).
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:54:06
It’s a serious timebomb under Bitcoin IMHO. Nobody knows if and when these coins will hit the market. It’s like an unknown state having a huge stash of gold that could hit the market any time. Gold would seriously devalue.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:16:26
Aaaaaaannnnnnnnnddddddd we’re up again!
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:57:02
Costly test...
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:32:16
So what would be happening if the gif is up side down?
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:59:13
Not in The Netherlands.
8K holidays are, however ;).
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:35:31
Great you think the opposite. I wish you all the best.
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:50:34
A basic rule of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:26:48
I can just aswell come up with 5 reasons to be bearish.
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:13:03
Not saying I’m leaving crypto forever, but if you’ve been in crypto long enough you know that this crash is quite different. Large surge to 20K is most probably caused by the larger public getting in (I’ve spoken to hair dressers getting in). That money is leaving now and must be replaced by other money to give btc a large boost. I don’t see that money flowing in in the next couple of months. So I’m out for the time being.
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:36:38
There aren’t any and dutch law would require registration.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:32:42
I see a green dildo coming out of this bottom
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:45:01
This is what a deflating bubble feels like. I’ve felt it twice before. Get out!
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:42:39
I’m not talking numbers dude, but I haven’t been in an office since 2013.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:24:27
Because the market isn’t rallying. Volume goes lower and lower.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:19:18
Same here; I invested in the dotcom bubble, invested in housing and invested in btc. I’ve seen my bubbles and have learned when to get out.
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:13:15
General direction is still downwards, volatility too high. Don’t expect the market to recover in the coming months.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:48:53
Dude, would you also take out a loan to buy 25K in lotery tickets? If not, sell everything, repay your debts and invest what you can afford to lose. If that turns out to be nothing, crypto is not for you.
