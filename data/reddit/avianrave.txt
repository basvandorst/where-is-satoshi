Except not everyone can become a (profitable) miner nowadays, unless you have cheap electricity and the correct equipment. 
As for running a node, sure it's more expensive, but nothing is stopping anyone from setting up a node except buying the needed equipment. 
Wouldn't a state have an easier time to control 2nd layer centralized solutions (such as coinbase) rather then gamble on moving and **keeping** the population onto a centralized coin.

They would just need to keep it going long enough. 
As for an attack on  BCash, wouldn't the attack be 32x as expensive (assuming 32mb block limit) to keep the network at the same tx fee as Bitcoin? It isn't immune to the same attack, but it would be much more expensive to pull off the same effect.

Looks like it is getting worse.

This 100%
All bitcoin has going for it is the network effect.

Your arrogance just earned you even more downvotes.

It does if you act the same way IRL.
You say you are interested in adult replies, but your attitude reeks of a teenager who thinks their opinion matters.

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Bitcoin was never meant to be a currency, its a store of value!!!

If LN works properly, then BCash could just tack it on their project. 
We need a bandaid for today's problem.

can they track the movement of coins from the SR wallet to his?

Print out a paper wallet with $50 or so (make a copy for yourself in case they don't use it in a month), and hand it to them with a guide on how make a wallet and accept payments.

Why would the old bitcoinss have to be sent to a more secure wallet if they haven't been moved? Rest of the post makes sense.

For me it's the lack of things that I can buy with bitcoin that wouldn't be easier to just buy with cash. There is more of a hassle when I would have to convert my existing money to bitcoins to use them, when I could just buy those same services with cash. It just adds another step to the process.
I do see very big potentials with it though. I would have loved to have known about bitcoin when doing my gradschool overseas. It would have saved me some money on wire transfers from my US bank to my UK bank (as well as being instantaneous). In addition, it seems like London is adopting the bitcoin quite well compared to the suburb I'm currently living in. But because I am not travelling internationally in the near future, I don't have much of an incentive to buy bitcoins because it just adds another step in the process of paying someone.

When can we expect medical schools to provide an education at a regulated cost?
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:17:14
Look up how much debt medical students can expect to have out of school.
