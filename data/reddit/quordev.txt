It's a funny but important distinction for economists.

Maybe it's just the holiday talking, but this sub is incredible.

Looking forward, I'm really excited for OpenBazaar to take off. I've been looking forward to it for most of the year!

He wasn't charged with that.

Presumption of innocence, breh.

Definitely! Also for fans of beat poets/writers. I recommend the Burning Chrome short story as an introduction, then Neuromancer.

I don't know about that, I thought about just *leaving* while waiting for the person in front of me to figure out their chip-card yesterday.

Your insurance company might be interested in some of your purchases.

It would be interesting to see a gov't agency try to prove ownership of funds.

Bitcoin might get the Trump effect - the media just can't stop talking about it.

Can a Mycelium seed phrase be used with Electrum? Or do I have to actually send the coins?
@_date: 2017-01-03 20:40:18
What was the upfront cost? Are you profiting?

Trying to BTFD - CoinBase is drooling on the floor.

You're thinking of the people in bitcoinmarkets asking, "how much could I make with .08 bitcoin and 100x leverage?"
@_date: 2017-01-03 20:47:53
Are you referring to waiting for confirmations?

He's reformulating OPs question as an answer

So is GameKyuubi still hodling?
@_date: 2017-01-03 20:30:49
This is correct. The utility of the blockchain is that it is distributed among all devices running bitcoin software - to alter it would require altering the ledger on a majority of all bitcoin nodes in the world simultaneously.
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:59:03
They need to stop rolling out projects with primary features missing. This got my attention forever ago, and it still doesn't have the part that I'm interested in.

If theoretically the Chinese government "banned" bitcoin transactions, what would that look like? I think bitcoin is technically banned in Ecuador but of course enforcement is impossible.
Ultimately the CCP are trying to curb capital outflows while making their citizenry look like an attractive cheap labor force. Too much pressure might make them look desperate and increase flight. If they keep devaluating the Yuan, money is going to leave the country, and I'm betting it's more cash and (fake) gold bars than anything else.
@_date: 2017-01-13 19:00:57
Yes, but are you prepared to *die* for your county?
@_date: 2017-01-03 20:37:42
Someone posted here maybe 8 months ago with details on a large scale bitcoin solar mining project they were starting in the desert with leftover power/infrastructure for their off-grid grow operation. I'll try to find it when I get home.

I'm not sure Mycelium prompted me for a password. I have a PIN though. If I write down the seed phrase and format my device, am I okay? Would any of that information exist in backups?
@_date: 2017-01-13 19:07:55
It would be a buying opportunity because very little would change. They don't have the resources to enforce drug laws in their country, much less go after illicit currency dealers.

BitPay's terms of use prohibits "items that are considered obscene" and "certain sexually oriented materials or services".
Are they just being theatrically cautious? I can put those things on my credit card.

This should be completely covered as a parody.
Are y'all familiar with "Dumb Starbucks"?

Apple is able to push settings on people - some people like that. There's also a false dichotomy here: I have Cyanogen installed on a Samsung device, Google's got nothing to do with it.
Baseband software is another story...

That was also my experience in Denver. I've said it before, but bitcoin has no marketing team. Even if we all feel overzealous at times, there are still plenty of people who have never heard of it.
@_date: 2016-02-17 16:30:21
I don't think "wireless transfer" pushes bitcoin into criminal territory automatically.
@_date: 2016-02-11 05:06:07
Even still, have you seen *Dumb Starbucks*?

I think we should be more than a little suspicious about the involvement of western intelligence in fomenting war. Hell, we've caught the CIA red handed more than once. 
They're sucking on purpose because we give them more power when they fail.

At this point, no well-informed person should believe these activities are "inadvertent".

Great timing. This was front page news in my city:

See spot run. Run spot run.

I thought it was a William Gibson reference.

I second this; seeing the font would help.

So he's a whale. Wouldn't he damage his own holdings if he tried to liquidate any of that?

Start with Gibson's short story "Burning Chrome" for some well-aged, distilled cyberpunk

Hah, I didn't click the link, but that was honestly my first thought.

Granted, did you see Amazon last year?
@_date: 2015-11-20 16:36:04
Similar deal though, now instead of J. Edgar Hoover calling up his media contacts to spin a story, they have Intel officers with persona management software and a fuck-ton of social media accounts.
@_date: 2015-03-17 01:21:26
Hah, they sound a little desperate.
