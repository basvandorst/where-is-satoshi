Please tell me more about this. I find it interesting.
For example, how can we actually know that the natural state of economies are of a capitalistic nature? I mean to me it seems reasonably sane to define economies as "human economies", and in that case we can only really study ourselves. For contrast I could say that the battery in my phone is an economy. So clearly a definition not including humans isn't going to tell us very much.
Now we obviously haven't seen what happens at infinity. And since the economy right now, to be honest, isn't very capitalistic in the strict sense, something is going on here.
My natural science intuition tells me that the world economy not being capitalistic in general means something has disturbed it, *excited* the world economy if you will. If so, what would that be? How do you approach such general and theoretic economics as "the natural state of an economy"?
I'm curious. ^ ^

I might be missing something but defining "capitalistic" as "*the economic state of affairs which occurs when people are allowed to pursue their own interests and incentives, without submitting to any arbitrary, de jure, outside forces.*" (or similarly) seems like a circular definition. Specifically "*when people are allowed to pursue their own interests and incentives*" means that **any** behavior would by the definition of capitalistic, be capitalistic.
Which of course makes the economy capitalistic, but the notion of capitalism rather useless.
But as I said, I might be missing something.
I for one would like to hear about your hypotheses.

That was an awesome video. Thanks for sharing! It really makes you appreciate how awesome humanity actually is.
So this actually proves me wrong in saying that the world economy isn't very capitalistic in the strict sense. It definitely is.
However I'm still not buying that it is *the* natural state of economies. I'm not even sure it's *a* natural state. But that might not be what you were trying to answer, even if you quoted me on that question.
