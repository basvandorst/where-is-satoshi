At this time I'm fully confident being part of this. They are diversifying with bitcoin ATMs and merchant bitcoin adoption however, which would mean that their wealth will be contingent on those expansion things working out - unless they never mix investment pools, and let's face it that just never happens. I would have preferred if they stuck to what works :). Still, I'm intrigued.

Thanks. Check this out:  I think that this gives me at least some perspective on their activity and size, but maybe I'm foolish. You can also see how their mining power is increasing. The sites look ghetto IMO however, and I wouldn't have invested if I couldn't spare the BTC. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:12:33
Thank you kind sir!
@_date: 2014-12-19 00:00:34
Hey thanks, I will pay it forward :)

You are right. I do not have many Mexican contacts in the US that are sending money home frequently, but I will spread the word in my girlfriend's family. Meanwhile I hope that my pictures serve that same purpose. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:45:34
Yeah, both MXN peso and USD use the dollar sign. Hence the confusion.
@_date: 2014-04-26 17:42:59
Why do you feel Mexico will become a big player in bitcoin per se? I am a business owner in both Mexico and Romania, so I'd be interested in hearing solid reasoning.

I've had a good amount of success investing in mining at bit club network (landing page  It's a mining rig on 100% renewable energy, but since my mining contract hasn't ended yet (1000 day hold and I'm continuously reinvesting rather than cashing out) I can't really vouch for it. These are my earnings on a $3500 'founder' package after 55 days:  Or those would the earnings be if I didn't reinvest all to compound. It comes down to around 5% per month thus far.

Yep Dutchie living in Mexico. I'm trying this out first thing tomorrow, I AM RICH BITCHESSSSS!!!

I was really excited about the trezor, until I bought one from buytrezor.com and it has taken almost a month to receive now.
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:31:13
I doubt it, I think this wasn't built for bitcoin at all and sendbitcoin.mx is making great use of an existing FIAT feature this way. I believe this is currently mostly used for internal transferring to bank accounts within the same bank but I'm not sure.

It's odd that you'd use the 'videoscribe' software to promote your business instead of getting an actual animator. Budget issues? I'm all for more payment processors, but I think it's very odd that you'd use a $50-100 solution to make one of the first promotions for your brand.

WU must charge something like 5% or more + exchange fees in case there are any which is obv terrible. I can't begin to compare that one. Transferring I'm really not sure, but I'll do 1% any day.

 started offering 35% revenue share for the first few months for all affiliates. This is by far the fastest growing casino by the way. The live dealers are sexxxxxy. I am helping them expand their reach so if you need free reviews or content let me know!
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:22:34
 dealers are super hot

Most of these were submitted to our platform by redditors (they receive a royalty payment when sold), and can be paid in bitcoin:

Great advice. What do you use to facilitate cold storage? There's probably a great guide on it that I missed somewhere. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 23:59:33
Not sure how? It doesn't let me edit...
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:48:10
Great, enjoy your tee! It should be shipped out early next week. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 17:42:06
ha..ha..ha. As a euro living in Mexico for 5 years now, I see the media is still doing a great job on the ignorant.
@_date: 2014-12-19 03:59:00
Indeed. Corrected, thanks.
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:29:48
It cost me less than a dollar to pick up $78 (1000 pesos), so yes. $5000 (or $375 or something in dollars), would have cost me $50 pesos, which is $3.75 or something. It's awesome!
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:42:19
Isn't this an obvious chargeback? I wouldn't want to risk it in any way and somehow exceed the chargeback period.

A week ago I lost my password to blockchain. Turns out that as opposed to some of the other exchanges, there is no way to recover from that one and I hadn't read the fine print. Adrenaline started shooting up since I have all my coins there. I was trying random passwords for about 30 minutes and then found the right one. I was already in acceptance mode. Could have been a tremendously expensive learning curve, but in the end bitcoin does make up for it in everything else.

ELI5 what is a multisig? Omg I'm so lazy I don't deserve a response. I have a trezor but no idea how this multisig jibberjabber works. Technology is winning my mind.

Thank you 5 bits @_date: 2015-01-02 04:03:03
RemindMe! 2 months

Nice! Hoe film je dit? Op een green screen of zoiets? Ben benieuwd naar de setup, lijkt me leuk om zelf ook te doen.
@_date: 2015-01-07 02:14:26
Great piece coins2014, but you'd start doubting if this site can even be put to rest anymore. It's already enjoying 2m visitors a month or so. It's kind of like the huffington post of bitcoin, they can talk infinite smack and still thrive.
@_date: 2015-04-22 02:39:12
So I am non technical and I don't understand how I can run the program. I do like spending bits of coin, so how do I get a screen in front of me to browse a market place? Thanks :)
@_date: 2016-10-02 13:31:14
No monthlies with wirex and xapo afaik, just 2-3% on every transaction.
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:13:35
They cancel the bonus upon request and roll back to pre-bonus status. I cleared mine in about 2 days on slots and it was a 100 mBTC deposit.
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:22:27
It's like everybody knows and I'm the slow kid in school, but; On average in December 2013, how fast can it put out one bitcoin? ie, how long will it take before it earns itself back?
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:48:27
I'd certainly be interested in that snack_man. I'm swamped right now but could you get in touch with me through laurence or skype 'lawrns'? That way I can coordinate the designs properly. Nice prints!
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:51:47
I guess more people live in the ocean than I could have ever imagined 
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:16:07
Awesome print! If you want I can add it to our bitcoin t-shirt collection here  and pay you $2 in bitcoin on every sale made. I've done this with 2 redditors so far. We accept bitcoin as a payment method as well.
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:06:08
Well, regardless of the mysterious sea people this tool is incredibly well made. Nice job!
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:04:10
Hi there, we'd be happy to feature it on our fyves facebook (brand:  and  and pay you a royalty on the items sold. Send me a PM with the design and I'll get it on there!
Our fan base is not particularly big yet so I can't guarantee sizable sales, but we can try to market it on facebook to bitcoin users!
