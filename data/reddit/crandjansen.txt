Lots of FUD here.  Just discussing the pure merits of the payment process, (and not a *very scary* portrayal of how someone who is really irresponsible with credit messes things up), the credit card process is ridiculously more advantageous for me.
I pay off my cards every month, so APR, missed payments, and heaps of debt aren't part of the equation.  I put mostly everything I purchase on a card that gets me air miles, and pay the balance monthly.  We get two flights a year from that.
There are two stores in my city that accept bitcoin, and one BTC ATM.  I put some money into my Coinbase wallet to buy coffee from one of the places for a few months.  Lost 30% of that money due to currency fluctuations.  I talked to the store owner about bitcoin and they said they get their money out of it the second they receive it, otherwise it's too risky.  They also pay a transaction fee to do that, as I did to get my fiat into Coinbase in the first place.  All told, it cost me ~35% *more* to buy coffee with bitcoin than it did to tap my credit card on the little sensor.
Don't get me wrong, I'm perpetually interested in crypto (otherwise I wouldn't be subscribed here), and waiting for the "killer app," but right now, for me, it's a value-loss situation.

I'm totally in the minority on credit card usage. But until Bitcoin offers up a no-brainer alternative that's more attractive than a fraud-protected credit card with air miles (and rental car insurance, and purchase protection, etc...), then I'm sorted when it comes to payment processes.
My experience with bitcoin as a consumer currency has been that's it's too volatile to keep on hand for more than a day, too inconvenient to buy more than once a week, and with a 1% fee in each direction it's more expensive than cash.
