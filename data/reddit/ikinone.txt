Actually, you did. Read up

And a million other people who weren't so lucky.

And in 5 years when it is $1m, how do you know you should sell it then?
Or in 5 years what do you do when the whole system fucks up somehow?

No one knows that. No one on this planet. No one can predict the future. There are way too many variables at work here. If it gets rejected or embraced in China it would have a huge impact on the value. Same in any other economically powerful country. If something happens regarding the computerised side of it it could destroy the value completely. Nothing we can foresee happening. It looks bomb proof, but we cannot be absolutely sure.
There will be smart people gambling either way on this. It is unprecedented.

I think a lot of people are actually not. And many who are 'addicted' would probably be absolutely fine without them when there are other priorities, like shelter and food.

Why liquor and cigs?

How are you defining 'a lot' here? I think 'a lot' of people are addicted. Do I think enough are addicted to prioritize hoarding those in case of an emergency? No.

There are way too many variables to take into account. This is new territory. 
You can gamble on the success of it, but it is still gambling.

Ohh, big boy investment banker. Being bothered by peasants asking questions?

No one knows. Really, no one knows. You throw money at this and you  could end up surfing the wave of the new elite class, or your money could disappear.
Like people say, invest what you can afford to lose.
Personally I would far more fear issues on the software side of things than I would legislation. Bitcoin is hard to kill with legislation.

My point is - how do you know it's a good time to cash out? Or in your case, to start spending

But you don't know they will reach that level. No one knows
