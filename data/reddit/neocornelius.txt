Exactly!  Rather than being the monopoly on information transportation, the postal system is now one piece of a complex and competitive puzzle.
20 years ago people were talking about a “paperless society” and thought we wouldn’t need the postal system any more because letters and documents would go away.  While email transmits exponentially more information today, there is still a desire for physical mail too.  That’s not even mentioning the rise of Amazon and other Internet retailers that nobody foresaw.

So I’m also in the situation where I don’t know the tech details of LN... and don’t know enough for this answer to make any sense.
I understand wallets.  I understand keys.  I understand that if my wallet crashes I can recover my bitcoins with my keys.  But how does LN fit in?
Are these coins now completely lost because he essentially has no keys?  Or can they be restored - but now all the coins from the channel are commingled so we don’t know how much should go to each person who had a stake?

Fair enough...

Correction:  The price bubbles in Bitcoin [as well as real estate as well as any other good] are “speculative mass delusions” as you might say.  It doesn’t change the nature (or potential) of value for the underlying asset.

A while back, someone on this sub (I think) posted a fantastic website for the complete archives of all of Satoshi Nakamoto’s listserv emails and forum posts.
Does anyone know what I am talking about?  Can you share the link again?  Are there any other good resources detailing the motivations and philosophy of Satoshi, Finney, and the other Bitcoin founders?

OMG, Bitcoin has dropped another 90% in value.  This is quite a big bear...

I have not lost anything since I’ve never sold.  Plus I have gained an incredible amount of knowledge by pursuing this interest.
It also helps that I haven’t put in more money than I’m afraid to lose, and I didn’t put very much money into the market Dec-Jan a year ago ��

That’s it.  Thanks!

Better yet, let’s do Nuclear energy.  It’s the best proven technology with zero emissions and it has consistent output regardless of weather.

One of my favorite quotes from Milton Friedman is, “I do not believe that the solution to our problem is simply to elect the right people. The important thing is to establish a political climate of opinion which will make it politically profitable for the wrong people to do the right thing.”
The same thing applies here for businesses.

I would take the idea that they are “supportive of Bitcoin” with a grain of salt.  Yes, they have both paid lip service to the technology and accepted campaign contributions in Bitcoin in the past.  But politicians are very good at supporting abstract ideas when they can benefit directly.
The real test will be if they implement policies that deregulate the monetary system so that Bitcoin will thrive.  I will wait and see if that happens.

Perhaps the State was repaid.  But the taxpayer lost money by the value of the currency being degraded through inflation.
