Yes they're legit. I've been using them since Dec 2017. They have the best and easiest to use mobile app in my experience.  I use another exchange called quidriga to cash out though since I live in Canada.

Bitcoin Maximalist have turned me off Bitcoin completely.

I don't think it's a recovery yet. 
Just a dead cat bounce .

There's a civil war going on in BCH community , i wouldn't touch it personally .

Nah way before.  I bought in at 13 cents after the wraith launch. My idea was to sell BTC and ETH at ATH and invest into a corrected market . Doesn't matter though because I refuse to sell it even if it goes to zero.

I'm expecting a nice increase followed by a final downturn which will push 3k-2k. If you believe in the Elliot wave theory we would be around the 3rd wave now.

I basically just want to see one country make it legal tender, I think that will be a huge game changer . I just paid capital gains on Bitcoin trades and purchases and it was a nightmare.

I'm not sure where your from but buying physical stuff with BTC in Canada is considered a bartered trade and you must pay capital gains on each purchase when used as "money". That's my whole argument that it should be legal tender and not subject to such nonsense .

Same 7k in xvg and it's now worth 500$ lol

The market dropped in January 2018 until  spring 2018 and then recovered. I guess if you bought the dip then maybe you maybe some nice gains . For everyone else it probably stayed the same. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:34:08
It's below 3.8k right now

Skipping on this dip, but that doesn't mean I haven't been buying on my way down this rabbit hole.

The point is , bitcoin and other cryptos are a tax  nightmare that is slowing down adoption and makes it a little less appealing. I literally had to create a .CSV file and calculate all my buys and sells to report my capital gains for 800 trades. I would not of had to do this if I had bought and spent USD with my CAD dollars.

I'm center left and hold Bitcoin so this isn't true for me at least haha.
