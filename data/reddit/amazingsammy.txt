Only trust software from trusted names or open source projects. Download.com has been distributing viruses and malware ridden applications since they started.

It's funny because bitcoin is a p2p network, not a corporation. It has no leaders, directors, or anything like that. And that's what makes Bitcoin interesting. Cnn is a dinosaur media outlet. They don't understand Bitcoin or decentralized organizations. So, at the same time it demonstrates both how silly it is to call someone the Executive Director of Bitcoin, and how out of touch CNN is for letting that one slide bye.

What's interesting about the newsweek story is that they're making a really big deal about the fact that he's a libertarian and a programmer, but most programmers are libertarians. 
Even if they don't realize it. 
You have the younger, softer libertarians who consider themselves centrist Democrats. Of course, there is no such thing as a centrist Democrat these days, but don't tell them that. And then you have the older programmers, who have a much harder stance on the general subject of freedom and transparency. 
But it's everywhere. Show me a programmer who is happy with the system as it stands today, and I'll show you someone is probably isn't very good at what they do.
So three facts: 
1. His name, a coincidence, but probably not. I imagine it's probably a pretty common name in Japan.
2. The fact that he writes code.
3. He's a libertarian.
You can write off all of those to fairly good odds.
People who don't write code shouldn't be writing articles about coders.
That's the bottom line.

Amsterdam is a city where a lot of things, including Bitcoin processing are permissibly legal. The connections are world class. Gigabit lines for everybody! There are already exchanges and miners in their data centers, and the government is not interfering the way the American governments are. And, the colocation prices there are within $10 a month of the wholesale rates in Kansas City or Austin for much slower service. There are a couple of other places I've looked at that fit the bill on what I need, but Holland fits every requirement, plus it has all the amenities.
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:23:01
It's also a huge blow to the government's ability to fund police forces by stealing  money from criminals. If you force Bitcoin underground by way of an outright ban, you create a superclass of unstoppable criminal. It happens quickly, too. Just look at Russia. They were at least smart enough to back out of that quagmire, before it got too serious.
With an outright ban, you also drive a lot of perfectly reasonable R&amp;D into the gray market, and away from paying their taxes, which would also be bad for the government. You might succeed in slowing the advance of Bitcoin down by about ten years in the States, but you can't hold back the tide forever.
I'm encouraged by some of the recent things we've begun to hear from the Fed and from at least a couple of half literate members of congress. I don't think a ban is coming, but I stand to benefit either way. So it's all good.

As a rule, I don't deal with any company or organization that involves itself in international boycotts or divestment movements. If they're paying attention to politics, they're generally not paying attention to delivering their products. I don't want to know what opinion a company has unless they make it a priority to tell me. Then, I'm not buying the product for the product anymore, I'm buying it based on their political opinion. And, as a consumer, that just makes me feel used. Can I have this bag of cheetos if I don't agree with your opinion about darfur? If I buy that bag of cheetos anyway, am I agreeing with you? See the problem? I don't really make it a priority, but if I find out about it, that company generally doesn't get my business. It's a strategy that's proving itself to be a good one.

Totally. I was talking mainly about the investor class. Institutional investors that don't really care about the things we care about. Things like financial freedom, transparency, honest money, or free markets. To their minds, misguided as they may be, they see regulation as synonymous with security and stability. It's been my experience that when governments talk about "improving" something, they're not usually talking about making it better.

Not to knitpick, but in legal terms, there's no such thing as a private company. You have private clubs, that do business by invitation only, and companies that do business with the public. Otherwise, I don't disagree. Didn't say it was my opinion. I said, there's a view in the market that regulation would help, regardless of merit. Personally, I think governments are obsolete.

@_date: 2014-01-31 07:35:42
Do you have any idea what kind of damage banning or attempting to shut down bitcoin would cause? Assume for a minute they attempt to do this. What happens? Well, considering that bitcoin is a protocol, and you can't shut down protocols, the only logical course of action is that Bitcoin would become the defacto currency for the black market, worldwide. 
If you were upset that the Silk Road had 0.05% of the global drug and naughty things trade, imagine what would happen if there were 10,000,000 such marketplaces, that made the Silk Road look like amateurs in their garages with 100% of the global drug and naughty things trade. Sounds funny until you consider that the feds have some recourse now, when people get caught dealing drugs. In a world where Bitcoin is illegal, there would be none at all. The best they could do is just sit, and watch the money go bye. 
The conclusion is ultimately the same though. The black market inevitably expands, eventually accounting for large amounts of legal commerce as well. Ultimately ending the power of the state to do, well, just about anything. In this scenario, it just takes about a decade longer to pull off. Maybe that's all they need.
If your goal as a regulator is to drive crime down, and punish the guilty, then driving Bitcoin underground is the worst possible idea you could possibly have. I hope they're smarter than that. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 05:59:46
What if the bitcoins belonged to an offshore LLC in a country like Cyprus, that only taxes operational earnings? If the company is not operating, then there's nothing to worry about. Actually putting a company in Cyprus might make you nervous, but there are dozens of other countries that have the same policy. That way, you yourself are covered. If you're working with nominee share holders, you have an even greater level of secrecy. 
Or, I suppose, you could set up an LLC in a non reporting state like New Mexico, and essentially do the same thing.

Right, but John Q. Bitcoin can't easily be abused by the state without cause. At present, anyone's life can be shut off without due process by any bureaucrat with access to the right button. Bitcoin and the cryptos offer a layer of protection, sometimes, from this kind of over-reach. I think regulators need to see that for what it is, and realize that they've been abusing their power for years. How is anyone supposed to defend himself in a legal system that takes the money he would use for defense?

I disagree on the viability of a sandwich based currency. As such, I will create a competing currency based on bacon cheese burgers. 
There are several reasons for this. 
1. They go better with french fries, which can also be traded.
2. They contain mustard and/or mayo.
3. Very few things are better than bacon.
4. Bacon Cheesburgers process transactions faster, because they generally have more weight when thrown through the air.

It should be legal tender, because otherwise, you can force crypto vendors to accept dollars, when they don't want to.

In this line of reasoning, it would help Bitcoin consumers, even if it would add significant friction to transactions.

MySQL is great if you have the wherewithal to understand the limitations and scalability of your setup. It's gotten better over the years, but it's still the bottleneck in a lot of these types of projects.
More often than not, when people complain about how retardedly slow PHP is, they're unwittingly really complaining about how slow MySQL can be if you're not a SQL expert. My pet peeve with MySQL is actually the same pet peeve I have with PHP. It'll accept damned near anything you throw at it. 
You could make the argument that this is actually what accounts for its wide usability. It's easy. It takes five seconds to install, and get running, and any idiot with a keyboard can build something functional in it in a few hours. And that's fine. But as someone doing business on a platform, you have NO IDEA what you're getting. 
As far as the free conventional databases go, Postgres is actually a better database. It has great fundamentals. It's always been at least a couple of years ahead of MySQL. It's easier to scale, and it makes more sense if you're doing things that require low latency like trading.

In order to achieve any kind of hash power mining with pi's, you're going to need a shit-ton of them (to use a technical term).

@_date: 2018-11-24 09:08:22
I don't think we can call every overvalued asset a bubble, or every correction a bust. People in this thread are using some disturbingly broad terms. Markets are dynamic. We usually reserve terminology like that for things that bust big. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:14:27
Yeah, that's reasonable. At the very least, it's people with wallets, ready to accept btc, which is huge.
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:20:53


I would go further than implying it. Would argue that there was no bubble to begin with, and that asset accumulation and wealth generated by the internet since the 90's has been absolutely unprecedented in human history. What we call the dotcom bust was little more than the market shaking out the hucksters and speculators. That's what healthy markets do. The boom... never ended.

Sure. But Netflix earning 2500% over five years, Tesla at 1500% since this market started (despite never turning a profit), Priceline at over 5000% in a decade. Maybe I'm pulling at straws, but that seems like infinity to me.
@_date: 2018-11-24 09:05:43
Absolutely. I don't think crypto exists as a totally separate economy. It's organic. Inline with other markets. Many of the same investors.
@_date: 2018-11-24 11:58:58
I didn't think I was unclear on that, but okay. It's late. I could have been.
Amazon is huge, has assets. Still historically overpriced. Tesla's a great example. They do have hard product, but they're losing 20k on every car they sell, with no plan to change this. Maybe they'll make it out on scale? Maybe not. It's speculative. Netflix has growth, which is really all anyone cares about, but their content and operating costs far exceed anything they're bringing in. Stock price on all of these are unsustainable. You can't maintain 30x-50x earnings in any market forever. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 11:50:33
Yeah, I'm not clear on that either.
@_date: 2018-11-24 00:04:23
Well, if that's the definition you're using, we've got problems a lot bigger than bitcoin. Wallstreet stocks, in particular are at earnings to valuation ratios nobody's ever seen before. Much higher than the dotcom era. Especially around the FANG stocks that are driving the category. We've got a perfect storm of crisis around price discovery in nearly all asset classes, driven by artificially low interest rates and bank capitalization levels in the West. Meanwhile, you've got real estate prices much higher than they should be, given wages at the lower end and demand. We might have more than one bust on our hands when things inevitably come back for correction.

Yeah, but aren't we also factoring in the darknet? I would be curious about how much of it is trading, and how much of it is pretty little bags of coke.
Even so, though, it's still an impressive amount of volume.

Well, the business of astronomy certainly couldn't be done easily without them.

I don't know about that. The killer app for blockchains isn't efficiency. It's redundancy. Having all data everywhere, always. That's what makes blockchains interesting. They're good for things like transactions and rule enforcement. Currency isn't the only app that benefits from something like that. Though, I do think blockchain deployment has gone nuts over the last few years, and it is being deployed in ways that don't always make sense.

Sure. You could do it with text files if you wanted to.

It makes sense. Freeing up the supply for people who are interested in buying big. I've seen more elaborate campaigns for less.

Fair. But if anyone in human history were ever to eat his own dick, it would be John Mcafee.

Yeah, but this isn't Amazon. Bitcoin's already survived major corrections. In terms of percentage points, this isn't even the biggest btc correction on record.  Actually, one of the smaller ones we've seen. I'm not worried about Bitcoin right now at all. And if this washes out a few of the speculators or day traders, all the better.

Well, honestly, it's all the free pizza and beer. (I'm easy)

Still a little time there. I wouldn't doubt that he's still right on that. If you had told people after gox that bitcoin would be at even $3,000 in 2018, going into 2019, you would have gotten laughed at.

The following are bad ideas, in my opinion, ymmv.
* A centralized authority with the ability to audit and shut down accounts. That's the biggest thing I dislike about it.
* Complete lack of anonymity. They call it anonymous, but when you dig into their sales pitch, it's not. Not at all. The claim of anonymity is intentionally misleading.
* Direct interaction and interference from governments, on the basis that they happen to be governments. There is no built in protection against trade sanctions or oppressive regimes at all. Quite the contrary.
* In technical terms, the protocol is something completely new. Judging by the documentation on it, it's considerably more complex than Bitcoin protocol. This is not necessarily a deal breaker. A lot of payment systems are. But when you mix the complexity of the new protocol, with the value proposition... adopting it doesn't make sense. At least to me. If I'm going to be forced into a system of friction, and have to use a system that's more complex than bitcoin protocol... I might as well just implement authorize.net, or paypal.

I had this thought a couple years ago. What if I used the Darknet to sell toasters to drug dealers online? Or boxes of poptarts? Or mundane things like laptops and hair dryers? Still think it would be fun. Go to one of those drug marketplaces, pick up an ounce of weed, get some poptarts, and a bean bag chair. Maybe some pogs, or whatever.

Tried that too. Loved the idea of OpenBazaar, but nobody ever really used it seriously.
