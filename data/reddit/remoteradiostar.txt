Someone just sent from an exchange, nothing huge really.

Most cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin have created their own version of Electrum anyway.

Why not just post the software? Stop trying to trick other people into sending you their attempts just because you can't get anywhere.

Try Dash, then use privatesend then convert back to BTC. Certain exchanges seem to trust Dash a little more than XMR, you can get 2 BTC with Binance without KYC and push the rest through either localbitcoins or flyp.me
But you need to have the core wallet on your PC to use privatesend since not many exchanges use it... 
If you use both Dash and XMR you can easily get 20 BTC through in an hour.
Avoid shapeshift.

The Eton Building definitely exists, I've been in it before now on other business. Are you sure there aren't any people there?
Edit: oh shit, I just found [these guys]( at that address, they're a forwarder. Legal but sketchy as hell

It won't be anonymous... it'll have a camera on it for sure, and if someone wanted to trace you from there it would be quite easy.

What ‘massive problems’ might those be?

There are several guys in HK who do good deals between BTC and fiat. I’m not sure why everyone is celebrating these leaching companies who put 10% on the price and only let you buy and not sell.

True anonymity doesn’t really have that much of a premium if you know where to look.
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:49:24
If that is truly the case the exchange needs shutting down and whoever designed that needs to be fired and never be hired anywhere near computers or security again.

My point is you are *creating* wallets, not restoring them... I can put 12 words right here right now, as long as they are valid BIP39 words and match the checksum it will create a wallet for you with zero balance.
@_date: 2018-06-17 17:18:39
Yeah you could say that, it looks at the Blockchain for the transaction history for the private key and shows you the transactions. If you import a private key into Bitcoin Core it will not show all your transactions until it’s caught up with the blockchain.
A web wallet like blockchain.info essentially holds your private key for you and handles all this on their servers, so you don’t really see what’s happening in the background.
@_date: 2018-06-16 07:41:51
You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how BIP39 works, it creates deterministic wallets... the seed words create a private key. You can go [here]( and just click 'generate' and it will generate you random, correct seed words that you can then import into whatever you want (blockchain.info, your own wallet, whatever) and it will show you *zero balance* because no-one has generated your seedwords before.
A wallet is never 'opened' or 'closed' it literally just gives you a private key. Any BIP39 words can generate you a private key as long as the checksum is correct (which is why it will tell you some are wrong)
Any Bitcoin wallet has *no idea* if the wallet has been used before, just generated or whatever. All the words give you is *a private key*
OP has not created 60+ wallets, you aren't restoring OP's wallets, you're just getting private keys that may or may not have been used/generated before.
@_date: 2018-06-17 02:19:43
Blockchain.info generates the private key from the seed words you put in, then gives you access to the wallet. Blockchain.info has no idea if it’s new or old, just does what you tell it to do.
But why was it transferred to another person?? That shouldn’t happen...
@_date: 2018-06-10 06:53:49
The reason for fixed denominations is so that you cannot figure out who sent what in and got what back. Otherwise how do you avoid identifying the guy who sent and got back 0.98352 BTC? It’s obvious who it is

Why is BCD a HODL?

Pretty much any guy on localbitcoins who deals in cash and has high rankings, I’m not going to recommend a specific one as I don’t want my Reddit account tied to my trading. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:18:35
The last word is a checksum, seriously look up BIP39 because it’s all in there. Some won’t work, some will, but these wallets haven’t been ‘opened’ it’s just because the checksum is correct....
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:43:09
They’re deterministic, there is no system. Any wallets that have the correct checksum to create a private key will create one

You cannot withdraw from most of them, only deposit and with huge fees.
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:19:23
Yeah the possibility is there but it would probably take until the heat death of the universe if you wanted to brute force Bitcoin keys...
And yeah you’ve got it now, all you’re being given is your private key. The seeds are just an easier representation of the key for humans.

For people like me who live in China they definitely can trace your every damn move down to your door if you so much as look at one of these machines the wrong way.
I’d rather trust my encrypted VPN and computer than showing up in person to one of these things.
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:43:51
No you didn’t recover 40, you made 40...the wallets you’re seeing with 0 are brand new, no-one has touched or generated them before.
You can make a new wallet with literally any 12/16/24 words as long as the checksum is right.
@_date: 2018-06-17 06:42:24
Yep, it has no idea, all it does is generate you a new key. There are so many keys though that it’s statistically very very unlikely for you to ever generate a private key that someone else is already using. No-one has ever generated a key that someone else already has. I think the actual number is more stars than are in the whole universe.
