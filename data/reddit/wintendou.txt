Gold is not copper, they are entirely different things by name and substance.
You are making horrible examples because you don't have a case.  For starters, naming things regulated differently than generic terms with respect to trademarks is silly.
Believe it or not, but branding is a trademark issue and bitcoin was never trademarked.  It has become a generic term like "dollar".  Anyone can take the term bitcoin and add a modifier to create a trademark, but no one could get away with trademarking the generic term now that so many people are using it as a generic term.
Again, bitcoin core fucked up by not creating a foundation that could hold the trademark and defend it. Now its generic and anyone can use it.  Core is now the only bitcoin without any unique branding, which will hurt it going forward.  They really need to uniquely brand it to avoid confusion with other bitcoin brands.
I don't get where you think you will find grounds for a lawsuit, this is pretty standard stuff.
Someone else said people transferred core bitcoin to a cash wallet and lost it.  Well that has nothing to do with bitcoin cash.  They didn't create the wallet or tell people to transfer money to it.  If it was an exchange wallet, the exchange fucked up instructions or the user didn't read them.  The same thing has been happening to ERC20 tokens and no one is filing lawsuits.  Its user error.
@_date: 2018-05-03 00:26:12
 I expect there to be more in the future, but only coin that offers the same privacy cash transactions have will have any value.  If bitcoin is traceable the same as credit cards and bank tranfers, it has no point.
The common person doesn't care about decentralization.  You need a compelling feature.
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:22:35
Cute, but using your debit card doesn't expose your bank account balance to merchants or anyone else you send money to.  Nor is all your activity public to anyone who wants it.

@_date: 2018-05-14 00:13:59
And pay 30% fees. You joking?  Plus the second you use the wallet to buy anyting shipped to your address, anonymity is lost.  And that doesn't solve the problem of exposing how much money you have in a wallet each time you do any transactions.
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:24:56
Binance requires the use of their coin and their discount goes away over time.


Digital coins are like credit purchases but with less privacy, not money orders.   Digital coins have fees to use them that can be higher than normal credit fees.  Digital coin fees don't give you any of the benefits credit fees give you.
Digital coin needs real features for consumers to adopt it and anonymity would be the best feature that could be offered.
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:02:54
All your ways to spend bitcoin anonymously require jumping through hoops and paying more money.  You are daft.
The system should be anonymous up front without any nonsense.
@_date: 2018-05-17 02:51:05
You seem confused.  If digital coins do not mimic cash online, then they have no purpose to normal users.  Normal users do not care about decentrilzation and you must offer a real feature to get anyone to accept the volitility risks.
@_date: 2018-05-16 18:59:50
Because it's not anonymous and can be datamined.

Considering how volitile coin is, how would any of these coins not be subject to inflation or deflation?  I don't think any other currency has seen swings similar to digital coins.
@_date: 2018-05-17 05:27:17
Except is traceable, unlike cash.  So you might as well use a credit card which has more privacy.
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:12:21


No it is not.  Inflation literally means the decrease of the buying power of money.  People who keep trying to claim it means something else are being very stupid.
Why would inflation only represent one source of inflation and not all sources of inflation?  The buying power of the currency includes all sources.


We are talking about money, not stocks.  The higher any settle point is, the riskier the money is to hold.
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:15:57
Cute, but bitcoin will never be adopted if it costs more than regular money and offers no actual benefit.  Normal people don't care about decentrilization.  The lack of anonymity in my opinion negates decentrilization, it will be easily regulated centrally because of it.
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:16:21
Cool, that helps bitcoin be anonymous!
@_date: 2018-05-15 03:39:00
The average person will never use bitcoin because traditional banking solutions are better.  Bitcoin's decentralization means nothing to normal people.  Having a public wallet anyone can view a balance of is not good.

Your original point is stupid because you clearly lack knowledge to make any.
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:28:34
Again, no.  They report nothing unless it reaches a threshold.  
But with bitcoin, everything will be openly monitored by the government.
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:19:49


Except the lack of anonymity makes it of high interest of governments who want to tax and charge people with crimes.  That is a fundamental law that isn't being addressed.
I don't think any coin can truly be better than money, when money can be used anonymously, but bitcoin cannot.
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:11:08
7% is still stupid.  Fees have to be almost nothing.  Plus this doesn't help you gain anonymity.  As soon as you make one purchase with the wallet that requires shipping info, your wallet is  now linked to you and all your transfers can be monitored.
@_date: 2018-05-14 05:24:38
No, you don't.  Decentralization means absolutely nothing if every government monitors every transaction and knows more about bitcoin transactions than fiat cash based ones.
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:29:41

@_date: 2018-05-03 17:15:52


That is not what the term inflation means without any modifiers.
You are talking about monetary inflation.  Inflation by itself always refers to the buying power of money decreasing.  This is because it includes every cause of inflation, not just increasing the money supply.


That is not going to change.  Plus if coin settles at a high price, it will be risky to use and hold since anything that causes a dip in demand would cause massive inflation.
@_date: 2018-05-01 03:23:22
Nope.  If someone says bitcoin they could mean one of the many bitcoin variants.  You can be pig headed all you want, this is just a fact.
Bitcoin let the term become generic and now anyone can use it.  Almost everyone outside of direct buyers refers to all digital coin as bitcoin, they don't understand anything about the market, but they know bitcoin is that online money stuff.
@_date: 2018-05-25 10:26:59

No, cash isn't traceable.  I can buy stuff on craigslist all day and the government won't know.  If I pay in bitcoin, anyone can track my purchases.
There is no valid reason why a digital coin shouldn't have anonymity built in.  I don't get why anyone opposes this.  It cannot replace cash if its less private than normal bank or credit transactions.
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:41:40
Glad you could admit you lack knowledge to have a valid opinion.
@_date: 2018-05-07 07:28:08
That isn't true.  Everything is a threat to bitcoin after fees hurt bitcoin so much.  The crash of the overall crypto market has helped bitcoin greatly by making fees way more reasonable.  They need to fix the fee situation or bitcoin could get left behind as the market rises again.
Technically the rise of bch is purely because of btc's high fees forcing people to look at alternatives.
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:26:09
Shut up.  You cannot easily protect yourself.  The fact that you need to actively spend extra money and time just to try to hide your transactions is a joke.
Why can't you just admit bitcoin is not anonymous and thus isn't viable as a digital form of cash?  They need to adapt bitcoin, lighting is a step, but that isn't a guarantee, it just increases the odds of privacy.
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:15:51
You are being extremely stupid if you think everyone is going to use a po box to try to make bitcoin anonymous.  Hell, po boxes aren't even confidential, the government knows who you are.
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:12:51
It does not apply to cash.  Nothing links cash to you.  Cash + shipping is still a single transaction, hell so is credit or bank transfer.
If you do anything with us dollars via cash or credit, your one purchase doesn't expose your account balance and merchants cannot monitor your wallet to see all the transactions you make.
Bitcoin allows for anyone to view balances and see all the transactions  you make.  Is quite ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-05-16 17:11:35
Lightning does add an avenue for anonymity, but lighting is not required and its not perfect. It requires volume to hide transactions.  Plus the government could just spin up nodes to get extra data.  Another flaw. You need a system that doesn't allow nodes to identify wallets.
Lightning also doesn't change the fact that all wallets are visible.
@_date: 2018-05-15 03:40:38
Jesus christ you are daft.  First, banks must report to the IRS.  The IRS doesn't have open access.  That is why structuring to get around the 10k reporting requirement is a crime.
You are so sad.  Bitcoin will be much less private than any bank if it doesn't implement anonymity.
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:07:24
Cool, you can live in digital equivalent of a cabin in the woods.  But most people will want to spend their money.  Spending money anywhere that needs shipping info exposes your identity.  Same with accepting money from a service that needed any personal details to sign up.
Plus in the end, do you really want a system where any time you transfer money, other people get to see the size of your bank account?
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:13:19

@_date: 2018-05-03 21:38:04

@_date: 2018-05-15 04:22:35


False.  Almost no one uses bitcoing at all.  Like less than .0001% of the population.  Divid  that by a trillion if you want to know how many people actually used bitcoin as cash and not an investment.
@_date: 2018-05-15 00:51:56
Or, adapt coins to be anonymous by default instead of create barriers that involve expert knowledge.
If you want the average person to use your coin, you cannot take away their privacy unless they are experts with extra cash to spend to gain it back.
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:04:18
Its all true.  


You learn it over time.  Just like people did with investigations such as the mtgox one.  Unless someone fills a wallet and never touches it, evidence is created and eventually you can dox the owner.  But that is just an outsider.  Have a store that someone buys stuff from?  You can build a list of names/addresses and wallet owners.  This info will be sold off.  It will be no different than current facebook info or adnetwork data collection.
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:39:46
Dear god, you are slow.  Look at all the high profile wallets linked to real people just by looking at the blockchain.  You are being goofy.
The government will be indexing the whole thing and know all transactions and balances of every wallet.
@_date: 2018-05-13 20:40:11
Sadly, bitcoin doesn't help anonymity.  Any viable coin needs to be anonymous.
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:48:19
LOL, you are sjw incel.  That is pretty funny.
@_date: 2018-05-16 00:46:23


Again, you keep citing all these hoops people have to manually jump through and pay fees for in order to try to get anonymity.  Of course, since transactions are all public, this won't work in any way.  They watch as you split the money.
You would have to perfectly mimic real natural purchasing behavior to not be found out and you need other people to use those anonymity wallets, which means giving a 3rd party control of your coin.
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:05:54
The end game for a company is bankruptcy with the company being worth nothing, thus the stock would be worth nothing.
You could try to say there is a floor because stock can only drop so low before a company gets acquired, but there are no guarantees anyone wants to buy up a company.  The ownership from stock therefore doesn't create a reliable floor price for the stock.
In the end, a stock will eventually collapse to zero, the question is how long will that take?  10 years, 100 years, 1000 years?  Someone is going to eat the loss when the company fails.
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:59:06
Its a zero sum game.
Say he bought it for 500 and sells for 1000.  The new person bought for 1000.  If it drops to 500, and he sells its a 500 dollar loss. He funded the profits of the last owner.
If it goes up from 1000 to 2000 and he sells, he makes 1000, and the new owner has it for 2000.  If it drops to 500, the new owner loses the 1500, he pays for it.
Eventually bitcoin will fail and drop back to zero, the person holding the bag loses all the money.
The only way someone doesn't eat the losses if it always goes up forever. That just isn't going to happen.  It will fall back to zero eventually.  Bitcoin has no underlying value to create a floor price.  Something better will eventually displace it.
Stocks technically have a floor price, they can only get so cheap before someone wants to buy up stock to buy the company.  Because stocks are tied to ownership.  Bitcoin doesn't have that. Also stocks can still become worth nothing in a bankruptcy where a company closes up, so ownership isn't a guarantee of a floor.
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:30:27
Come back when its working.  If its better, people will use it.

@_date: 2018-03-15 20:34:49

There will be no loyalty.

He is talking about stocks or coin.  All transactions based on these things require a loser for every winner.  Now the loser could be distributed so many people lose a little, but its still a zero sum game.
If someone makes 100 bucks, someone else is losing 100 bucks.
Now, the losses can be delayed if you run like a pyramid scheme and the price keeps going up.  New investors keep funding those that cash out, so the price doesn't drop.  Eventually new investors dry up and the price will fall.
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:21:02
Except it was.  People moved off of bitcoin due to the fees and eth saw a boost.
@_date: 2018-03-17 17:51:33

@_date: 2018-03-13 14:58:44
Sure, if it goes on forever.  One downside to having no ties to a government is that its easily replaced if someone makes a better coin.
So there will be a day when bitcoin dries up and someone is going to eat the losses.
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:09:51
There is nothing you can really do.  Merchants look at the fees and that is all they care about.  Bitcoin is at a disadvantage as long as there are coins with cheaper fees.
Hell, if it wasn't for fees, bitcoin would be 40k by now.  But fees prevented btc to be used for actual purchases.
@_date: 2018-03-16 22:03:57

By being rich and having his own plane/helicopter, he could reach a ton of hospitals fast enough to be eligible to be on way more donor lists.
This allowed him to get on lists in lower population areas in the middle of country with shorter waiting lists and even jump over people who might have had a 3 hours drive, because he only had a 2(?) hour plane ride.
Basically he used money to make himself a "better" candidate by being more available than other patients.  This enables a hospital who wants his money to legally justify calling him over other patients.
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:01:03
Again, they purposely take the money and demand proof to get it back to steal it.  There is nothing that says they cannot demand the proof before taking your money.  So just stop with your nonsense.  The law not mandating something does't make it legal.

Toys R Us isn't going under due to sales.  They would be fine on their own.
Toys R Us went under because a shitty capital firm bought them and mortgaged every asset they could to get an instant return on investment.  This is that vulture capitalist stuff Romney does.  Buy a healthy company with no debt, and extract as much money as possible by loading it up with debt.
Toys R Us has failed because it cannot make the debt payment for debt the company didn't even create.  Why will no one buy it in bankruptcy?  Because online sales with home delivery is taking over, so no one wants to get started in b&amp;m at this time.  Toys R Us was never able to invest in online sales because of the debt they have had to pay.

The problem is merchants and consumers don't care about the network.  They care about low fees and fast transactions.
If you want the best network to win, you need to make sure that network has the lowest fees and fastest transactions.
Someone posted a screen that shows bitcoin with a 1.3% network fee and bcash with a 0%.  As a consumer, if I am paying the fee, I am using the coin that is cheaper to use.  The average consumer doesn't care about details.

@_date: 2018-03-17 21:04:06

No one is reading any of that drivel.  You need to learn how to make concise points.  I never asked you for a term paper on false information.  Again, they shouldn't be taking your money if they are going to require that you prove who you are to get it back.  They purposely take it and then demand proof as a way to steal your money.  There is probably a percentage of accounts that are abandoned and that is why they do this.

The west already has safe banking options, the people without it will adopt the best coin and that will spread to the west.

Sue them in US court if they have any US assets and seize those.  Otherwise you have zero recourse.  You cannot win in a chinese court as a foreigner.

Cute, but bitcoin was ruined by the fees.  No one could use it as a currency anymore.  Everyone was dumping bitcoin for eth because eth was more affordable for moving money between exchanges and making day trades.

Nope, it happened.   You would know if you were there.

You keep telling yourself that.  Crypto has no value.  Right now its dependent completely on demand by people paying fiat for it.  That is how it is priced.  If fiat is worth nothing, demand drops and crypto is worth nothing.
There isn't a single crypto close to being completely independent of fiat purchaser demand.
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:09:13
Just stop.  


No one is talking about "monetary inflation".  We are talking about inflation and deflation which always refers to the price of goods.  Why would you ever default to that?  If you want to talk about supply inflation or deflation, you must use the word "supply".
Inflation includes any reason for prices to go up.  Supply inflation(printing money) would just be one factor that could have an effect on inflation.  The price of bitcoin is not based on total bitcoin in existence increasing or decreasing.  Its based more on demand for bitcoin which causes wild swings in inflation and deflation(buying power).
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:59:58
I used credit karma.  Very easy to do.  The hard part is organizing your trade gains and losses.  The damn thing wants you to list every trade.  I grouped them into individual days to at least make it more reasonable.  Also used one of those free sites which worked since my trade count was low enough, since I only got in on dec 19th.
Of course I lost like 2gs so I had a reason to want to file the loss.  I made it up this year, but unless gdax sends that info the IRS, I'll probably leave it off and roll those dice.

I would consider anonymity to be a requirement of any online cash.  Its not cash if its traceable.  Might as well just use credit cards and bank transfers.
The more coin is used, the more of an incentive the US government has to create tools to bust anonymity so they can tax you and gather evidence for prosecutions.

This is sad.  Stop claiming when talking about bitcoin words have different meanings, that is not true.
Monetary inflation is part of what goes into inflation.  Inflation is everything combined that lowers the buying power of a currency.

You are quite stupid.  Gold is an element and regulated.  Bitcoin is a commercial product and unregulated.  Plus core and cash have the same lineage, they have equal rights to the term "bitcoin".
Core fucked up by not having additional branding, now cash can use the generic "bitcoin" and core has no way to tell the difference.
Unless core has a trademark or copyright, they have no control over "bitcoin" and the fork has equal rights to it.
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:02:25
LOL.  You keep talking about the total amount of bitcoin which has nothing to do with inflation.  Inflation is the increase in prices of goods.  Money has less buying power.
You keep taking the generic inflation term which has a specific universal meeting and keep using it to refer to total amount of bitcoin(a lesser used term for this would be monetary inflation, the term you cited but didn't understand).


False, they could upgrade the main branch and not fork a competitor branch.
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:59:32
I don't think consumers care about decentralized currency.   You have to offer some immediate benefit to get people to use it.  I would also argue the currency needs better stabilization.  People cannot risk losing large amounts of value by holding the coin.  The benefit of crazy gains isn't sustainable, any reversal and we see a nose dive and people dumping.  Sadly, decentralized I think prevents any kind of stabilization beyond freemarket demand.  That would be a great thing to solve for a coin.
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:02:07


100% false.  That is monetary inflation which has nothing to do with what people are referencing when they say "inflation" in general.  Inflation is a when the buying power of the dollar decreases which is based on anything that can reduce the buying power, not just printing money.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:45:32
A fork means both lines have the common lineage.  If neither side has exclusive rights to the term bitcoin and no one has any trademarks, then the term is free to be used by either side.
Thus this lawsuit most likely won't even get into a court because they won't be able to show ownership of the term "bitcoin".  Which could easily be the point of the person raising the money.   Have his suit tossed and keep the donations.
I would want to see proof of a copyright or trademark before acting like this lawsuit has any merit.

Bitcoin has way more inflation and deflation than fiat, so how is that a good argument?  No one has created a way to stabilize coin.  You would need a gold standard or something to peg it to and then release a finite amount all at once.
@_date: 2018-04-30 21:00:39
I get this weird statement.  But where is bitcoin cash sold as bitcoin core?  You cannot just say this is happening without providing the place its going on.  What exchange?
The pricing difference alone makes this an impossible mistake.
But again, both coins have the right to be called bitcoin. Core fucked up by never creating a distinctive brand.  Now people are calling it core just to differentiate in conversations.  That is a mess bitcoin core created.  They should have gotten a trademark.  They knew forks were possible and could have nabbed a trademark before the cash fork happened.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:43:12
That is most likely a scam. They don't even try to explain what they mean by fraud or why they think this lawsuit is even valid on that website.  Not a single detail at all.

@_date: 2018-04-30 17:35:20
How could they claim a loss? Both coins have basically raised and lowered together.  The fees have been cheaper for bcash too.
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:32:28


No, I do.  You don't.  If you say inflation by itself, its the price of goods(ie buying power of money).  
This is universally true.  Just because you were wrong, doesn't mean you can change how normal people use the term.
When they say there is 3% of inflation, they are not saying the money supply went up 3%, they are saying the average cost of goods went up 3%, thus the dollar is worth 3% less.
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:44:24


There cannot be fraud if bitcoin was not trademarked by anyone.  Trademark is how you protect against brand confusion.  There is absolutely no case without a trademark.
Apple was a terrible example since the beatles owned that first and apple has ended up in court multiple times over the apple trademark.  They ending up settling each time by paying the beatles a crap ton of money.  Apple had to basically buy apple rights from the true owner.
But these cases only exist because trademarks were filed and defended.  That is a key for a trademark.  It must be filed and you must actively defend it.
This lawsuit has no case because no trademark has been filed and the person bringing the suit doesn't hold the trademark.  You cannot sue on behalf of someone else's trademark, you have to hold the trademark yourself to sue over it.
What exchanges name the coin means nothing.  That is not a trademark.  Hell, cash has gone by both bcc and bch postfork and btc prefork.  There is no consistency at all.
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:56:14
No, it relates to the cost of goods. If the price of goods goes up, its inflation.  If the price of goods goes down, its deflation.
It has nothing to do with the supply of money.
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:36:10
You have mental problems.  A court doesn't care about buisinesses sharing trademarks if no one had a right to it before it was shared.
Bitcoin cannot claim ownership of "bitcoin" if the creator made it freeware.
Core fucked up by not inventing branding after the fork which created two branches with equal rights to "bitcoin".
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:14:45
What will current bitcoin accomplish?  Its not anonymous.  Its has fees higher than other services that swap US dollars within the US.
Bitcoin can't even work for remittances if the poorer market cannot handle the withdrawals into local currency.
My bet would be on any coin that offers anonymity as that is something people will pay transaction fees for.

If the US dollar is worthless, bitcoin is worthless.  Its valued in USD.  If bitcoin magically didn't drop, the sheer fact that anyone with USD cannot afford it would tank demand and topple bitcoin's value.  Just like we have seen with a loss of demand after december.  Its no coincidence its getting a boost now that people got tax returns.  There is new money coming in again.

Selling actual apples and oranges is regulated by food regulation.  That doesn't exist for digital coins.
If you are going to keep claiming there is some regulation that makes it illegal for bitcoin cash to use the term bitcoin,  you need to post the law.  Because I guarantee you there is no such law.  Coin isn't regulated like food and from what I can tell, bitcoin was never trademarked so there is no owernship of the term by core.  At this point "bitcoin" has become a generic term.  Common people call all digital currency bitcoin.  bitcoin is used in the names of multiple coins.
Like it or not if core wanted to own the term bitcoin, they needed to protect it and they failed to do so.  Now anyone can use it.  It will eventually be a problem for bcash too as they cannot stop anyone else from using it.  The term bitcoin is a terrible term to use for branding because you cannot control it.

lolwut?  Deflation is when the value of it goes up.  I can buy a lambo with less bitcoin because the value went up.  Inflation is when the value goes down and it costs me more to buy that lambo.

You are being absurd.  The crash of the largest currency invested would absolutely tank demand and kill it.  But even if one other large currency involved crashed, it would tank demand and kill it.

It is, there is no case.  The lawsuit page lists no information about what they are even suing over.  Bitcoin is a generic term no one owns the rights too, and bcash has the same bitcoin history since it forked. 
No one associated with core trademarked or secured any rights around bitcoin.  That was a mistake if they now want exclusive usage, as its really too late to claw it back.
Look at the fork for the CI tool hudson.  Java held rights to the name, so when the community was tired of oracle's bullshit, they forked the code and renamed their fork jenkins.  If java never owned the rights to the name, they would not have had to rename it.

It is the buying power.  You are not being rational if you think the US price swings of coin do not affect buying power.

You need to look it up.  There is no fraud here no matter what you say.
Core and cash have equal rights to the term bitcoin.  They have the same bitcoin lineage.  On top of that, any startup can use the term if no one holds a trademark(legal ownership) of the term bitcoin.
Show me who owns the trademark.  There is no misrepresentation to call a digital coin bitcoin because that is what many people call all digital coins.
@_date: 2018-04-28 04:50:20


They have equal lineage on bitcoin, so you are being retarded.  Unless core has a copyright or trademark exclusive to them, the have no exclusive rights to the term "bitcoin".
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:21:02
List the trademark for bitcoin, if its not trademarked, then bcash has every right to use bitcoin.  It has become a generic term like candian dollar and US dollar.
Waiting until a fork happened and a competing bitcoin appeared to start demanding sole ownership of "bitcoin" was a huge mistake.  You cannot claw that back.  Especially if the guy you don't want using the term bitcoin has the money to defend his usage in court.
For this lawsuit to work, whoever is managing rights for core needs to register bitcoin as a trademark and send the owner of bitcoin.com a cease and desist, then go to court.

Please explain where its fraud for bitcoin cash to use the term bitcoin?  Its in its name.  No one else owns any exclusive rights to the term bitcoin.  Cash and core share the same historical lineage.
If you have no answer, then you are admitting you are wrong.
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:16:53
I just explained why you were dead wrong.  Bitcoin's total supply has nothing to do with the inflation or deflation.  If that is what mattered, then the price of bitcoin would only inflate based on the new coins generated by miners and it wouldn't deflate unless people destroyed bitcoins by throwing away wallets with coin in it.
Consumer demand greatly overshadows any change in total supply to the point that mined coin and burned coin really have no effect on the buying power.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:37:07


The issue is that it really isn't.  They are free to call bcash just bitcoin if they want.  Bitcoin didn't trademark the term, so they have zero control.
A fork means both sides come from the bitcoin line and both sides have equal rights to the name bitcoin.
Like it or not, the coin that will be called bitcoin by consumers is the one that lasts the longest by gains the most consumers.
Bitcoin "core" basically has a branding problem if they have no way to differentiate from forks that have equal rights to the term "bitcoin".  bcash is taking advantage of it.

Since no one believes that, no one is going to buy coin for that reason.  So its meaningless.
Plus when coin relies on demand, what happens if US dollars are worthless?  There is no demand, the coin would crash.  A collapse of the US dollar will not make coin worth anything.
Coin only becomes worth something if people keep wealth in it and use it as a currency.  That will never happen as long as it is volatile and costs more to use than electronic us dollar transfers.
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:04:40


Bitcoin is a generic term like dollar.  Its like US dollars vs canadian dollars.  Whoever "owns" bitcoin failed to trademark and own rights to bitcoin.  This is why we have the free software foundation for linux, a central body that can manage IP rights and make sure being open source doesn't mean rights aren't secured.
They should have created a bitcoin foundation to hold a trademark and defend it.  They didn't.  Now its a generic term no one owns.  Anyone can make a version of bitcoin and use bitcoin in the name.
@_date: 2018-04-26 01:24:32
Its sad how delusional people are.  If demand for coin falls, which happens if the dollar loses a ton of value, the price of coin must fall.
Thus the price of coin will always tank with USD  as long as USD is a huge market for coin.
