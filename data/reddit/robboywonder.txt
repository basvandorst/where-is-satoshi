whaaaaaat? first of all. what?
second, there probably isn't enough data to support that claim. bitcoin has been around for what, 6 years? And in that time it's gone from pennies to hundreds of dollars - thousands of percent? My house went up by maybe 10-30% in that time.

IMO gyft doesn't really count as using bitcoin. you may as well sell your coins at an exchange and get cash. there's essentially no difference as they use the visa/mastercard system which is based in dollars. I have a hard time believing you or anyone spends a significant amount of money on podcasts.
i don't know. i feel like the statement ...


....is not true at all. A tiny and inconsequential fraction of your needs - which are really just luxuries (podcasts, video games) - are paid for with bitcoin.
the vast majority of your needs (housing, food) are paid directly with dollars - or whatever you use in your country.

aren't you forgetting the opportunity cost of buying this miner? you could buy $300 worth of bitcoin today and if/when it reachers $20,491/BTC your BTC holdings would be worth $10,784. I assume you calculated it would only mine 0.0146 BTC ( = $300 / $20491/BTC).
I don't think this will ever be profitable compared to just buying bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-08-03 06:44:06
at the end of the day, you're talking semantics. i don't know what pseudo hidden means. the point is that the blockchain functions without regard to people or names.
the gates in and out of the bitcoin "world" are what tie your name to wallets.
for example, if i buy bitcoin on coinbase, they will have my name next to a wallet and yes, you could connect the dots back to me.
but say i had mined the coins myself, there would be no way to link me to those coins.

....but i doubt that will be the case. if you set up a system where there is a financial reward for exposing secrets you'll get a lot of false positives.
....you'll get people stealing information that should be legitimately secret - and profiting from theft (a crime in and of itself).
....you'll get people stealing more and more - which is obviously a bad situation.
And correct me if I'm wrong, but this isn't just for government secrets - this is for private information too, right? You think we should set up a system where people can sell proprietary secrets on some anonymous black market?
That's really fucked up. Ok, sure. It will happen any way. The internet makes this sort of think really easy....

holy shit, dude.
ok look. an american illegally crossing into mexico is nothing like a mexican sneaking in to the U.S. Because of the different economic situations in each country, the usual reasons for sneaking into both are drastically different. An American doesn't need to sneak into Mexico, as they have a  reasonably open policy. They can probably just go. However, an American with drug charges or other reasons for wanting to avoid  authorities is likely to try to sneak into Mexico. That's why it's such an offense there.
A Mexican sneaking into the U.S. isn't likely coming here for nefarious reasons. They're likely just coming across to do manual labor and send money back home. That's the reason we treat them differently. Because we know they're not coming here for trouble but out of desperation.
Have a little context.

@_date: 2014-07-10 20:31:22
Yeah. And I never claimed otherwise. Because Bitcoin is a brand new technology, old definitions are a little irrelevant. We have to start thinking of words/definitions in their purest form. This conversation is a perfect example. Before you'd ask " what is hyperinflation?" and someone would answer "when a gov't prints a lot of money and it devalues the currency"
but now, we have to think about what hyperinflation fundamentally is: it's simply a devaluation of currency.
@_date: 2014-11-21 17:18:31
key word: **if**
my point is that, sure, bitcoin has advantages. 
but they won't be felt until everyone adopts it. and if there is no incentive to adopt immediately -if people are depending on everyone else doing it, it probably won't happen.
it's like global warming and pollution. no one person has any reason to stop polluting because the next guy over will continue to pollute at an advantage. but we ALL as a society would be better if we stopped (probably).

look. you're taking an extreme position on an issue that has essentially been settled and is about as constant as gravity. i don't really feel the need to counter your - and i don't mean this as an ad hominem - naive and childish opinions.
we don't have it down perfectly yet. but the past 1000ish years of global political philosophy have pretty much nailed down that society, laws and governments are a pretty good thing, regardless of the specifics of each.
not all governments are good. governments ruled by men are generally terrible. governments ruled by law and the equal and blind application of those laws are generally pretty good.
from a pragmatic point of view: if you want to go off into the woods and not be part of society, go for it. if you want to be around other people and not be put in a cage, you should probably obey the law.

No. Not at all. That's extremely short sighted.

if you're talking about adoption stable = stagnant. That's just word play. And i would argue that at the scales we're talking about (less than 0.01% adoption) stagnant is a much more appropriate word to use.

@_date: 2014-07-10 22:28:13
my point is that for me - and for your average person - there have been no changes in the last 8 months in terms of useability. 8 months ago I didn't know any store in my city (Austin, TX) I could spend bitcoin. I still don't. Yes, I could google it, but that's not the point. IMO I shouldn't need to seek out places to spend bitcoin. Is that asking too much? I don't think so. I would expect the "fastest pace sector" in the last 20 years would be faster than going from nothing to nothing in 8 months.
ok there is a lot of "behind the scenes"  "big money" coming into bitcoin but...so what? it's so irrelevant to normal people unless bitcoin is something you follow and read about.  it reminds me a lot of google glass. people who are into it are fucking pumped...but nobody really uses it or understands why you would want to use it.

i seriously doubt that is true. illicit alcohol was easy to come by and people had to go to shady bars and speakeasies (run by gangsters) to drink. I seriously doubt there were fewer violent alcohol induced crimes when it was illegal. alcohol drinking went underground and thus into shady underbellies of culture. think about it: when you go out to bars now, there are police preventing fights (actively and passively) everywhere - at least where I am from.
but that's completely irrelevant....
1) nobody gives a shit about violence caused directly by drugs. nobody is talking about that. nobody is talking about how people on drugs commit violent acts. whether that is true or not, it is not part of this discussion
2) i do think this post is hyperbolic. i doubt silk road is even 0.01% of drug traffic in the united states.
3) If the state has in it's power to continue to perpetuate a violent drug war that harms people by the millions  versus legalizing the activity, regulating it, taxing the exchanges etc, it is most definitely responsible for that. I understand that individuals are responsible for individual crimes, but the state is responsible for perpetuating the system that these crimes take place in. The drug dealers and cartels will never stop. The more the state cracks down, the more profitable it is for them. The state can only surrender. And it might as well profit from it.

banks can insure themselves and regain their funds in the event of theft (and i suppose individuals can too, but it's probably not worth it)
banks get robbed of funds all the time. why don't we hear about it? because they're insured and they get that money back.
nothing will ever be 100% secure - to fill that gap banks insure themselves.
i understand how bitcoin works. that's precisely why i know that users looking after their funds themselves is a horrendously bad idea.
Let's flip your argument around and put the burden on you for  a second. Why WOULDN'T a user want  to use a bank, if they had no intent to do anything illegal, or send money overseas or had no problem currently using banks...you know, like most people today.
Don't jump down my throat about "that's not all bitcoin is for". that's not my point. my point is that people are perfectly comfortable letting banks look after their money right now. everyone does it. so why not add that layer of security (in the form of insured banks)?

yes, science and tech do work like that. is a photon a particle or a wave? that's about as scientific as you can get. the answer is it's both and neither. it depends on circumstance and your way of thinking about it.
  
it's kind of like a dollar bill. you could tell whether or not i might have touched a dollar bill because my finger prints would be on it (traceable) but i could easily own a dollar without having touched it and you could never know unless i told you  (anonymous).
i've answered your question as best as it can be described. if you don't like the answer, I'm sorry. You're not going to get another one. "pseudoanonymous" means that it isn't 100% truly anonymous and it isn't truly 100% traceable. it's both. end of story.

It's really easy to say all that now but at the time it was pretty gimmick-y. No one else had email. there was no one to email! Also, very few people had computers. Even less had internet connections. It was also difficult to set up email and because no one else had email really there wasn't much incentive to start using it. Remember this was 20 years ago. The internet of today would be unrecognizable to someone in 1994. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 16:42:01
Yeah. Honestly, remittances make a lot of sense. But there is nothing on the other end.
Say I want to send money back to my family in Mexico. There are no businesses in Mexico (not a lot, at least) that accept bitcoin so I have to exchange it to pesos. There are no good exchanges that change btc for pesos.
....so what's the point? Why, if remittances are such a good idea, hasn't someone monetized this yet? It would be so easy. 
Just go down to Mexico, set up a stall, and sell pesos for bitcoin. Even at 2% you're killing Western Union.

@_date: 2014-04-08 00:27:28
Right, but inflation happens. Thus any money you have saved is decreasing in value. Just because you're earning more this year, that doesn't change the value of what you have previously earned. Say I saved $100 dollars this year and inflation is 4%. That means next year my $100 will be worth 96 of today's dollars.
Investing your money is a completely different and separate issue. You're earning money from those investments. If your investments earn you 3% per year and inflation is 4% per year - you're losing wealth.
@_date: 2014-08-05 16:01:59
It's not stealing company time. My argument is that practically you should be paid for time during which you can't do personal things. If I'm stuck at work, even on break, I should be paid for it.

@_date: 2014-04-11 14:41:10
I don't know if that's true. Those markets are pretty hard for any one entity to manipulate - they have so much momentum and moving parts. You need industry wide manipulation for it to be worthwhile. Not saying that doesn't happen (LIBOR scandal, for example), I just don't know if Bitcoin is less manipulated as a few key players and shift everything.

why didn't you invest in oil in 1908?

GHash.IO doesn't mine. They are a pool. My understanding is that miners do the work, GHash.IO pools the rewards, takes 2% and distributes the coins evenly amongst the miners.
$/btc and difficulty don't matter because they will always make 2%. As long as that 2% can pay for their server and overhead costs it will be profitable.

edit: More on the topic: Just think how many menial jobs there are out there that could be eliminated by people doing it themselves - and getting financially rewarded for doing so. Think how much of the cost of everything round you is because of laziness. 
Now, i understand that sometimes it's more efficient for 1 specialized person to do something but I can think of a few instances where it would be better if we all just took the 2 seconds out of our day to do it. Hell it might even be more efficient, who knows.

the "creation" of bitcoin has nothing to do with inflation/deflation.
if something used to cost 1 btc and now it costs 5btc, that's inflation.
if something used to cost 5 btc and now it costs 1 btc, that's deflation.

They're a player in a big game, not the rule makers.

Thanks, I have. And philosophically I don't see why you can't call miners middlemen or that there are no third parties. Bitcoin by definition has 3rd parties -there's you, the person you're giving money to and the people who verify transactions.
I realize they're not in possesion of your funds at any time, but they do decide what goes into the blockchain so in a sense they are the arbiters of the network.

No. Hyperinflation is just the devaluing of a currency i.e. a loaf of bread than used to cost $2 now costs $100 because nobody wants to be holding dollars.
If there was some huge hole in the Bitcoin protocol that rendered it insecure, you can bet your ass the value of bitcoin would drop to near zero.
@_date: 2014-08-03 08:08:07
then in the context of bitcoin here is the answer.
bitcoin is anonymous if you create a wallet on your computer. no one could know that you own that wallet. 
bitcoin is not anonymous when you have an account at coinbase, or when your employer sends the coins to your address. coinbase and your employer know you own that address, or at least you claim to own it (btw you could prove it) in that instance the wallet address is tied to your name.
like a dollar bill, you can know some owners of the dollar, if you have a record of finger prints. but if you don't know someone's fingerprints, you can't know if they touched the dollar - only if every time you touched the dollar you got new fingerprints
tl/dr: it depends.

bitcoin has very easy applications for sending and receiving payment. we don't need a hotmail. we have very many, very easy to use software at this point, IMO.
the problem is bringing people into the ecosystem. and that problem is a fundamental problem to currency. it's not even a technological hurdle, really.

well pretty much everyone I've talked to on the subject - which i just did at my office - everyone who was in university at the time it was getting big - the 90s - agrees that email was pretty useless until they got to work in the late 90's. Professors didn't really know how to use it, and nobody wanted to communicate via email when they could just call. Pretty much my experience too, despite not being in college at the time.
I'm not really sure what your point is. Do you not think this Bitcoin giveaway is analogous to universities giving email addresses out? I think there are a ton of parallels.

i assume you're trying to compare bitcoin to dollars and how the supply of dollars increases and so the value of the dollar declines over a year.

man, being called dense by some 14 year old (or adult with the mental faculties of one) on the internet hurts so much.
1) i never said bitcoin is bad for anonymous transactions.(please point me to where i said anything resembling that comment) it's exceedingly good at anonymous transactions. There are ways to acquire bitcoin and remain 100% anonymous.
2) what other method do I suggest? I don't have a suggestion. 
But you know what? That's not really my problem. I'm not the one needing, asking or looking for an alternative. Because you *can* conduct anonymous transactions very easily if you just try.

You said it yourself. You're making works about Bitcoin The Ideology. You're making it about a lifestyle, a community and a way of life. Rather than what it is: a financial tool.

Honestly, i've had this same inane discussion with so many people on reddit before I'm just gunna stop here. It's always the same lines.


That talking point is so worn out and it shouldn't take but a moment to see how shitty that analogy is.
The problem most of the people with your opinion have is that they don't separate taxes and spending they just view them as two sides of the same coin. which they are. but just because one is performed poorly it doesn't discount the necessity of the other.
just because we spend our tax revenue on awful things like wars, it doesn't mean taxes are bad. it just means what we're spending them on is terrible. 
a government of the people, i believe, has every right to demand money to build public works and perform public services. But the people have the right to say what that money is spent on.

Then why don't they just institute a $50 maximum purchase. I can think of dozens of ways to make this easier and perfectly legal.
My point is - this is in no way easier than using a computer to buy coins of, say, Coinbase. So why use it at all? It seems like much more hassle.
Why not make it super simple to use, but you can only buy a small amount. Then you have a competitive edge over Coinbase.

To claim that you shouldn't have to pay for them, while you sit there and take advantage of them...now THAT is theft.
edit: I'm sick of this bullshit hyper-libertarian ethos in the Bitcoin community. I'm all for global currency and the tearing down of borders. I think governments, particularly the US federal gov't, do overstep their boundaries sometimes. I think we pay for things we shouldn't. But do I think we should get rid of taxes etc? No. Taxes, particularly progressive taxes, are the best way to combat centralization of power and wealth. We don't need to be fighting taxation. We need to be fighting bullshit government spending.

have you ever operated a credit card machine? well it doesn't matter, because you've probably purchased something with a card and seen this happen.
basically you scan the number, the machine contacts the CC company, and the card company says "ok, yes, thats a legit card, and we'll promise to credit you the money"
you can walk out of the store and the store knows you're good for the money. it doesn't matter if they don't actually have that money in the bank instantly, they know they'll get it eventually. these transactions are super fast - 10-15 seconds. sometimes less if it's something like mcdonalds where they just assume cards are always good. because it costs them more in time than weeding out fraudulent cards.

@_date: 2014-11-21 20:27:56
ah. you've touched on a great point, and i talked about it in another comment.
the problem with bitcoin is that it's binary. by using bitcoin you are necessarily not using dollars. of course you can own both, but it's zero sum. if you have $100 and you want $50 of bitcoin, you lose $50 of dollars.
but with email, you can continue receiving and using email AND use physical mail. it's not like you lose the ability to use physical mail as soon as you sign up with an email provider. 
as soon as i trade in my dollars for bitcoin, i lose the ability to use them as dollars,and that is a huge hurdle. what's more, i have to PAY to get over that hurdle....so what's the incentive?

I don't think you understand mining pools if you're worried about that happening.
Before the government comes along and pressures ghash.io to allow a double spend to do....something really bad! whatever that is...
.....GHash.IO needs to acquire 51% of the network. There are likely internal mechanisms at GHash.IO in place to prevent this from happening. For example, they may monitor the network and actively prevent themselves from having 51% or anything close to it.
More easily - many many many people monitor the Bitcoin network, both manually and automatically and switch to other mining pools so that 51% attacks can't happen.
Yes, there is a possibility that it could happen, but it's so low as to not really be an issue.

.....nah that would never work, right? I mean, we don't have roads now, right? No government built the roads that we don't use every day, so we don't really know if it could work....
@_date: 2014-05-14 15:01:02
I see what you're saying now. Yes they definitely make less money than they did before. But their costs are not related to mining hardware/electricity costs. Their costs are pretty much the same regardless of hashrate or price. Their profits change, yes. But their costs are probably pretty low compared to the money they take in. Although I know nothing about that sort of thing.

Can I ask how old you are? Because I don't think you understand how the internet was in its early days.  I remember getting my first email address in 1998....1998, not 1978... and it was pretty much a gimmick to me. I signed on maybe once a week, because I didn't have a computer at home. And we paid by the minute. And you would probably see or call anyone you'd want to email before they checked their email.

Guys. Calm the fuck down. Ghash.IO makes a shit ton from mining. Why would they want to steal currency from a system whereby that theft/manipulation would completely devalue the thing that they're stealing. Furthermore, why would they want to destabilize the very system they already profit from?

*eyeroll* i don't think telling someone to google the topic is elitism. We live in a day and age where pretty much all information is accessible at all times anywhere in the world. Just look to the right side of this screen. There is a list of FAQ and getting started links. Directing someone there is hardly an elitist thing - it's a time/effort saving thing. Also, much of that information is vetted and agreed upon by the community. It's probably a more reliable source than some random commentor on a forum.

thanks for the high school economics lesson. i understand supply and demand.....
my point is that inflation doesn't have to do with money creation or supply at all.
for instance, oil might be in short supply, trucks have to spend more to get products to market, prices go up. that's inflation. it had nothing to do with money supply or demand.
@_date: 2014-08-03 08:36:38
it's anonymous when you need it to be. it's not when you don't.
they use pseudoanonymous because it would be disingenuous to say it was completely anonymous all the time. i don't understand why you dislike that word so much. it's a perfect descriptor.
They don't push two conflicting ideas. Forgive the appropriateness of the analogy, but they're pushing a coin that has two faces. Therein, in my opinion, is the benefit. The synergy between being anonymous and traceable is the beauty of it.
@_date: 2014-06-03 17:58:13
Yeah, but IMO that's not really another currency. It's just calling dollars something else; iCash. The value of iCash will probably never fluctuate. It will be tied to the dollar. Its basically making sending small amounts of money around easier. I doubt you'll be able to send thousands of dollars or anything like that. I doubt Apple wants to be involved in laundering debacles. In some countries you can already do what you're describing using conventional banks.

even if bitcoin does indeed get as easy as dollars - or even if it gets easier - there is still fundamental barrier to using it. that is, you have to fork over money + some exchange charge just to acquire bitcoin in order to spend it.
this was not the case with email. ok yes, using email in the 1970's and 80's was a pain in the ass, but as soon as good applications for it came online there was zero cost (except for a computer + internet connection) to using email. there was zero risk. if you signed up for email and got 1 email per month...who cares? it was still free. AND you could continue to get physical mail. you didn't have to choose email or physical mail - you could use both.
with bitcoin, you can't have bitcoin AND dollars. you have to make the choice. that's why the email analogy isn't accurate.

1) Fuck you. You don't know anything about my education. But judging from what I know about mine, it's likely better than yours.
2) Many questions in life are not binary. You should learn to embrace that fact. You're essentially asking "This word "grey". Does it mean black or white? which is it?"
Answer: "It is both and it is neither"
The point is - and this is why they chose the prefix "pseudo" - bitcoin shares many qualities of anonymous systems and many qualities of completely traceable systems. There are instances of completely anonymous wallets whose owners we could never know. Satoshi Nakamoto's wallet, for example.
But then, many of my wallets are completely traceable.

@_date: 2014-03-24 18:31:07
Yeah. Precisely. I already have an account at a bank. Why does this machine need my palm print? I should just be able to insert my credit/debit card and buy BTC.

Yeah. This is something i had to overcome in the early days. I saw it as a get rich quick scheme. I had the realization that I will only make money if more people buy in...
.....then I realized it's more than a speculative investment. It's a pretty big deal if it succeeds. To date I have lost a decent chunk of change, so I'm not saying this as if i've made a fortune and am trying to say how wonderful bitcoin is...

yes, you being a complete anti-government loon reflects more poorly on the bitcoin community than......the government....? as i said, apples and oranges.
my point is: hyper libertarian nutjobs are really, really toxic. and no one in the mainstream wants anything to do with them - for good reason. and thus no one wants to climb into bed with them financially. just like no one wants to be associated with hardcore totalitarians. extreme views on anything tend to be the loudest and wrongest.

@_date: 2014-08-04 22:07:27
i would think so. i don't see this as a hardware problem. the hard part is syncing up your tab system with the bitcoin system. would you have a new address for every transaction? one address per server? one address per day? per restaurant?

@_date: 2014-05-14 14:44:49
But there is always the almighty dollar. People can just say "oh...well...fuck bitcoin, I'm moving back to the dollar" if the system starts looking sketchy.
@_date: 2015-05-10 19:15:09
that's a fine analogy. 
but in this instance you're taking the hard stance that relationships/marriage is bad and no one should be in one because there is risk of being in an abusive one.
which is obviously a dumb thing to think. there are very many good reasons to be married/in a monogamous relationship
i can think that nepotism and greed and corruption are bad while simultaneously thinking government is an inherently good idea that we should strive to make better. it's not one or the other. just because bad things can happen in a system doesn't make that system bad.
you're viewpoint/ideology is way too black and white, which should be a huge red flag. the way you talk and the things you say are far more extreme and irrational than mine.
@_date: 2014-06-04 19:57:45

@_date: 2015-05-10 22:27:17
...really....not getting it huh?
$1200 maybe be a good buy one day and a bad buy another. 
would you have invested in the NYSE in 2000? Would you invest in it in 2008? 2010? Right now? See my point? Sometimes it's a good buy, and sometimes it's not. 
Regardless of final outcome, if you could get the same amount of coins for less money in the future, it is a bad buy.
@_date: 2014-04-30 18:38:45
I dunno, man. I'm with you to some degree. I am surprised Bitcoin adoption is going so slow, especially with how easy it is now, relatively, to get coins
I hate to bring it up, but mass adoption of the internet needed a little prodding like this too. I bet a lot of people first had email addresses at college. It might have been their first interaction with email and the internet. They were just given it, rather than having to seek it out themselves - which is a huuuge hurdle. But once they had it they saw the benefits and it spread to other people. Even facebook started this way - colleges first.
@_date: 2015-05-10 20:04:39
this is a tactic i see a lot with anarcho-libertarians. you ask them a direct question and they just dodge it and present you with some state-sponsored atrocity.
they never actually have any real answers, only criticisms of the status quo. which is usually fine, unless you have no reasonable alternative.
@_date: 2015-05-10 21:45:06
......exactly. november 2013 was a bad buy. end of story. it's not like we need to see what the future holds to know that's true. 
If you think otherwise I have 13 bitcoins to sell you for $1200.
@_date: 2015-05-10 21:20:11
No. You're missing the point. It's about opportunity costs. The fact that bitcoin decreased in value means it was a bad buy, regardless of the eventual price. You could have kept your money and bought right now.
If you bought 1 bitcoin for $1200, you would right now have $240 worth of bitcoin and if it's ever $10,000 you'd have $10,000 worth of bitcoin.
If you had NOT bought then and bought now, you'd have $1200 worth of bitcoin and if it goes to $10,000 you'd have $50,000.
**tl/dr: Not buying bitcoin in November 2013 was a better financial decision than buying, regardless of future price.**
@_date: 2014-07-10 19:34:33
I agree. I'm sick of it too. I hate the oppression complex surrounding bitcoin. The "revolution is coming" mentality is very scary. No one wants to be a part of anarcho-capitalist-libertarian bullshit except anarcho-capitalist libertarians.

@_date: 2015-05-10 21:13:34
Laws and law enforcement certainly prevents me from stealing. I steal music online because I know the likelihood of getting caught is next to nil. I don't steal at the grocery store because I could get caught and thrown in jail. I speed all the time, but not by more than 10mph because of the associated elevation in risk of getting caught. 
I don't murder people for moral reasons but that can't be said of everyone. I have a lot to lose by murdering someone, but that can't be said of everyone.
There are plenty of people who don't sin for religious reasons. Personally I don't think Jesus exists so he has no power over me. But I know they government exists and even if I didn't it would still exist regardless of whether or not I believed in it. 
You don't seem to care about government but I doubt you're typing this shit from jail. So you do respect our laws even if you talk a big tough guy anarchist game.

Guns are really cool if you're a historian, or a mechanical engineer, or *someone who sells guns*. But to your average person they are terrifying.
In the same vein, computer scientists, mathematicians, *people who have a vested interest in bitcoin adoption* are going to like Bitcoin a lot more than your average person. And in the end, they are right. It is internet money.

You sound like a fucking jackass when you claim all that obey rules and vote and actually enjoy living under a functional state are somehow deluded.

I'm giving you the opportunity to make choices in hindsight. I'm offering you $1200/bitcoin.
The fact that you wouldn't take that price *today* means it was a bad/not best (or whatever semantic games you want to play) buy in November 2013. **END OF STORY**

@_date: 2015-01-22 20:22:25
as someone who works in product design (i work with 3d printers and plastic injection molding machines every day) - if you're printing products to sell, you're doing it wrong.
Unless you're making prototype parts or 100% unique parts every time or your volume is so small (less than 100 parts) - 3D printing makes no sense.
A good 3d printer is what...$10,000? (maybe $100,000 for high end machines, those shitty $2000 home printers are worthless for high volume, high quality parts). You could tool a simple plastic injection tool for $5000. And you could make 10,000 parts for pennies per part.
Also, as soon as you add electronics, or multiple materials or really anything beside ABS plastic, you can't use a printer and will have to use conventional manufacturing.
Oh also, all your parts have to be like 12 x 12 x 12 inches. Nothing big, yet.
I don't really see why cutting out a manufacturer is cutting out a middleman. Your manufacturing is a critical component in your product's lifecycle.
How is the person you bought your 3d printer from - or the person you buy the plastic printing material from - not a middleman in the sense that a manufacturer is?
@_date: 2014-05-10 18:10:51

@_date: 2015-01-13 16:07:51
no....you didn't FTFM.
Money supply is the total amount of monetary assets available at a specific time. The amount of bitcoin available right now is increasing.
Monetary base has to do with the amount of money central banks have and isn't an applicable term in bitcoin.
I suggest you actually look up terms before you pretend to teach them to people.

No. That's precisely what I mean by not having the same opportunity. They led completely isolated lives and thus were at a disadvantage simply by being born who they were. What are you, 14? How could you possibly think everyone has the same opportunity in life as everyone else? Did a kid in South Sudan have every opportunity to mine some bitcoin in 2010? Jesus Christ.


No no no no. There wasn't a 1-2 year period where the vast majority of dollars were created and distributed to a minisucle fraction of the population. And then in the following 2 years the value of dollars skyrocketted. Please. What's more: because dollars continue to lose value the people who had them years ago have less wealth and so people in following generations aren't fighting against people who are hoarding the original set.


That's why people hate the bitcoin community. People who say shit like that.

You're just a fucking hypocrite. You talk a big game on the internet but if or when it comes down to it you're just like anyone else. If your house was broken into you wouldn't just roll over and say "well i didn't protect my property" you'd call the police. if you were being assaulted, you'd call 911. you pay your taxes. you obey laws because you don't want to go to jail. 
you're just an internet tough guy libertarian whose ideology is so bankrupt you can't even present any mechanisms to implement it. You just point the finger at faults of the status quo using tropes you've read in internet bubbles of idiocy, like r/bitcoin. 
is our current system perfect? no. do we have work to do? yes.
is the concept of a society based on the rule of law and elected government illegitimate? No. The very principle of the rule of law is that it's above men. It is blind, impartial, and passionless. What you're talking about - men must fend for themselves, lest they be killed, is pure barbarism. Idiotic, stone-age barbarism.

@_date: 2015-01-12 00:09:25
Honestly. It's probably best that we don't get to decide directly where our tax money goes. Because it would just go back in to the pockets of those people who paid the tax - more so than it already does. Poor areas would get poorer and rich areas would get richer. Nothing would get fully funded and there would be huge planning issues because financing projects would be unpredictable. 
This is one of those ideas on r/bitcoin could possibly think is a good idea. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:06:54
A few points:
* You can maintain control of your BTC at all times.
* You can spend BTC in any country in the world.
* You don't need to give out personal information (like a credit card number) when making a purchase.
* In the long run, your dollar today will definitely be worth less tomorrow.
* You can store/acces your funds from your phone.
* You can send money to your friends - for movie tickets, food, drinks, debts - instantly, and pretty much free of charge. Sure you could do this with cash but, personally, I never carry cash.

i really don't mean to be condescending but you don't know what you're talking about. You seem to have no concept of the scales that manufacturing operates at.
small business manufacturing plants - whatever that is - will never use 3d printers. They are far too slow. Time is money. 
[Take this simple lego brick]( That would take about 15 minutes to print on a fast, one piece, crappy $2000 home printer. That's about 4 parts per hour.


You would need 1,300,000 3D printers to keep up with that volume. You see what I mean? We're talking 6 orders of magnitude, here.
And you're assuming that 3D printing will come down in price - guess what, so does conventional manufacturing....

Yeah, $32 is a good buy *now* and it was a good buy in March 2013, but it was a bad buy in August 2012.

@_date: 2015-01-24 21:22:20
@_date: 2014-07-10 20:16:44


No. It's not.


The definition says nothing about the cause (e.g. the government printing money) of the inflation.
There are many examples of governments collapsing and their economies undergoing hyperinflation. It had nothing to do with printing or creation of money. It has to do with the loss of value and trust in the in question currency.
Hell, gold could even undergo hyperinflation if it was discovered to be radioactive and give you cancer.
@_date: 2016-01-12 19:53:35
no. low oil prices are just a result of people going nuts and speculating on oil. companies got greedy and drilled too many wells. production has already slowed but you have to remember oil has a lot of momentum behind it. you can't just shut these wells off when the price isn't ideal. they kinda have to just drill the oil, take a hit and take whatever price they can get. supply will slow and the price will rise. happens all the time for all sorts of commodities. the sky isn't falling all the time r/bitcoin.

The trouble is, dollars/euros/renminbi work equally well, if not better than bitcoin in many ways.
Email's only disadvantage was that other people weren't using it. It was a superior technology to physical mail in every way. There is/was virtually no downside to using it. There was also no risk.
The is no risk or cost in signing up for an email address. With bitcoin, you literally have to pay for it to start using it.
That's a huuuuge hurdle these days where everything online is free.
edit: ok yeah, you have to buy a computer, and in those days they were expensive/hard to use. i get it. i mean, my grandpa still refuses to use email. but still, email is a bad example. 
"internet shopping" i think is a better analogy. at first it was risky. and maybe more expensive. and the selection sucked. giving your credit card details to someone on the internet?!?! but the international part was awesome. i grew up in england and i could buy stuff FROM AMERICA?! NO WAY!!
@_date: 2016-01-12 19:55:09

@_date: 2016-01-12 19:49:31
i don't think we're in either situation right now. demand is certainly not decreasing, maybe slowing. but there is an ever increasing amount of people who need oil for various things. so that rules out  Europe might have its problems but the U.S., China and Latin America are still producing shit tons of stuff and their economies are still growing - not necessarily as fast as they used to or would like.
And we certainly aren't in We have not only an surplus of oil *above* ground but we also have more wells drilling more oil than we need - which is what is driving prices down. 
So no, I don't think those are the only two possibilities. In fact, I'm pretty sure neither of those options are true right now. Oil is just experiencing part of it's boom and bust cycle, like literally every commodity ever does. Production will slow. Oil companies will take a hit (remember oil companies are some of the richest companies in the world. The sky isn't falling if they don't make record profits) and the consumer will get cheap gas and plastic for a few years.
@_date: 2016-06-18 12:44:56
That might have been a good response. Maybe Molyneux could learn a thing or two from you.
That said, I think it still focuses on the consumer/business relationship and not the issue at hand. 
If bitcoin blows up to some silly value there is the possibility that someone became history-making wealthy by theft. As the question poser muses: the world's first trillionaire could be a common criminal. What does that say about bitcoin? What kind of economy can really exist around bitcoin when possibly the wealthiest bitcoin holders have them illegally? 
@_date: 2016-06-12 07:26:21


UHHHHHHH yes. that! commerce stopping. we're talking about the fucking zombie apocalypse here. EVERYTHING stops. no running water. no farming. no electricity. no fucking computers running nodes all around the world. roaming gangs of bikers and the undead biting and shooting eachother. no rule of law.
I think you need to reconsider how complicated infrastructure is. And how many people it takes to run it. And how difficult it would be to get anything working when people are barely able to feed themselves. do you honestly think anyone will put priority into something as, frankly, 100% useless as digital currency when they have no food or water? People barely know about or care about bitcoin right now. Do you honestly think it would survive a catastrophic event like the end of civilization? 
"Oh just use solar!" 
Ok? Do you know how to run a solar power plant? Do you know anyone that does? What percentage of people do you think can run a solar power plant? maybe like....0.00001%? And they probably only know how to run one particular aspect of it.
get real, man. between the uselessness of bitcoin in that situation and the difficulty it takes to get it up and running there is 0% chance bitcoin would be used in a zombie apocalypse. ZERO.

We're talking about the people who stole the money from Mt Gox, or any hypothetical situation in which bitcoin are taken illegally. Not a contract where you got hosed.
Is it a good system to say "shit happens, better have better security next time - you deserve to fail because criminals were smarter than you!!"
No. That's stupid. We shouldn't live in a society where criminality cannot be punished.
@_date: 2016-06-18 05:10:03
I don't know enough about the DAO to comment.
Honestly, nor do I know enough about Mt Gox. But the question linked to in the video was simply not answered by Molyneux. Instead he went on a tangential rant about whether or not companies should be allowed to fail because of incompetence - but that wasn't the hypothetical situation posed to him.
For the sake of argument, let's agree that Mt Gox was hacked and someone stole their coins.
Is that their fault? Possibly. Possibly incompetent security. But possibly not. 
Imagine a much smaller scale mom-and-pop store who is the victim of some crime that puts them out of business. Despite all their preparation - insurance, locks on doors etc - the crime still puts them out of business. Now imagine the criminal or criminals are now extremely wealthy because of their crime.
Does that seem just? Does that seem like the free market working well? No. Of course not. The free market doesn't work if crime goes unpunished. It certainly doesn't work if it pays to be a criminal. 
That's the heart of this question: **what kind of economy will bitcoin support if the wealthiest bitcoin owners are thieves?**
@_date: 2016-06-18 10:57:06
Right..... but neither I nor Stefan Molyneux were talking about the DAO.
@_date: 2016-06-17 15:29:47
The question isn't about whether stupidity should be punished.
The question was "should criminality be rewarded?"
He conveniently dodged that question to suck the free market's dick and get some whoops and hollers from Alex Jones listeners.

@_date: 2016-06-18 05:25:38
hmmm not really. This is what happened:

@_date: 2016-06-11 15:47:07
(i'll assume you're serious for the purpose of discussion)
let's not pretend bitcoin is something it's not.
Bitcoin is a technological advancement, for sure, but it relies on the entire infrastructure humanity has built before it. It is, in reality, extremely fragile. Yes, the network is robust but if something catastrophic happened (like electricity disappearing) bitcoin disappears with it. Hell, even a dead cell phone battery or poor cell signal renders bitcoin temporarily useless to you even without a zombie apocalypse.
Things without intrinsic value (i.e. money) are basically worthless in times of crises. Remember that scene in 28 Days Later where he's walking around London picking up handfuls of £50 notes? Imagine that, but something even less tangible than paper money.
@_date: 2016-06-18 05:17:25
Everyone wanting to suck Molyneux's dick because of this rant needs to step back and consider the question posed to him and how he answered it. It boils down to this:

@_date: 2016-06-11 23:23:49


Yes. I think, in this zombie scenario, it's assumed electricity would be gone. I think we're talking about a 90-99% loss of human life and a total breakdown of social order. 
Power plants and electricity generation is not an easy thing to do. You need man power, technical knowledge and most importantly, a constant stream of fuel and water. Who is going to be mining and transporting all the coal and natural gas or uranium needed in these power plants?
You can't just say "oh well we only need a little electricity, we don't need to use that much coal/gas" because they don't work that way. They're rated for tens of thousands of homes worth of power. They don't just "run a little"
I suggest you watch the film Threads. It's a terrifying vision of post nuclear war Britain in the 80's. Shit gets medieval.
@_date: 2016-06-18 03:48:06

so.... everything you just described is problems with the *American* judicial system. Not everyone lives in the United States. If you actually bother to leave the country - or read about any other country - you might realize the problem isn't government. The problem is YOUR government.
Seriously. All those things are problems with the government of the United States. They're all totally changeable if we had the political will. But instead we waste time making up ludicrous libertarian systems of government where there are no rules and everything magically just works with no explanation....instead of fixing the actual problems we actually have.
I have never once said our government is perfect. Or good. Or competent. I have only made arguments for Government (big G). I hate basically everything our government has done on foreign soil for 60 years. I find the government run by a bunch of racists, bigots or financial criminals.... 
....But I still believe in government and the right of people to govern themselves. That's not brainwashing. That's a conclusion I've come to by living under several forms of government and actually thinking about these issues. I've seen the horrendous affects of stateless societies and it is fucking terrible. Want to go live in a libertarian wonderland? Go to China. Seriously. Go to China and see how fucking shitty it is living there. I go there several times a year and it is just a dump. You know why? Because everything is for sale, there are no regulations, and the police and judicial system are castrated by corruption and underfunding.

please. people didn't move to the United States because it was a shining beacon of freedom and republicanism. How many Africans did you see moving here in 1840?
People moved to the United States because it 1) had food 2) didn't oppress it's own people (except black people, native americans, the chinese, catholics,  and jews) 3) had free (stolen) land. literally free. you just had to go there.

[ok]( 
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:02:40


yes. precisely. who makes these rules? There isn't some inherent rule book inside everyone. Even if there was, not everyone has the same rule book. And the next question would be who has the authority to use violence to enforce anything?
let's just admit "ostracism" is not a viable solution, so lets just drop it. How do you enforce any form of rules or laws without violence? The next obvious question is who has the authority to use violence if no one can use violence?
@_date: 2015-07-14 01:19:57
so what would you call it when someone is beating the shit out of someone else and a police officer arrests him? is that assault?
yes? or are you going to qualify it with some dumb fucking name like "justifiable assault"
if not, you're saying arrest is ok in some instances. 
Then, at that point, arrest is not assault and we're just arguing over what is reasonable grounds for denying someone their freedom.
Get off your high horse and think about what you're actually saying.

I use cops because the original comment called arrest assault. try reading the thread.
It would be great if you guys would go to other countries and see that police aren't militant assholes everywhere. Some nations have decided their police should be accountable, friendly and helpful. We have the power to do it too. We just lack the balls to actually hold anyone accountable.

How do you figure that? I get that you don't need credit to use bitcoin, but you don't need a credit card to use electronic banking. You just need a debit/pre-paid card.


So how does this help? I mean, eBay and Amazon are very lucrative businesses. Why hasn't something filled the void to provide the same service in Chile? And why would OpenBazaar fill that void over an existing/successful business model?

You just don't value a government that doesn't adhere to it's own limitations (why would it?) You still believe in what the constitution stands for: free speech, privacy, free association, limited government, etc.
I have a feeling you'd feel different about representative democracy if you lived in a country without it.
like I said in another comment. Everything you're describing can be found in China. Go to China. It is a hellish vision of everything you think you want.
I spend a lot of time there and it's just awful. I wasn't a patriot growing up. I'm a dual citizen of two countries and never felt reverence to either country or government.
After going to China I appreciate what we have. It's not perfect, I know. But it's way better than whatever the fuck you propose (which is nothing....) and it's way better than China.

honest question because i've never heard that objection: how is military spending incompatible with libertarianism? 
aside from the spending achieved by taxation - is there really anything wrong with maintaining a military? If every country on earth was like North Korea or Nazi Germany and the U.S. was a libertarian stronghold, why would it be wrong to maintain an army (volunteer) to defend the principles of libertarianism?

So then there is at least one instance where compulsory taxes are not immoral. 
Doesn't it stand to reason that there might be more? And that taxes aren't inherently immoral. Yes, ideally they're used as little as possible, but that doesn't make them bad. 
Doesn't it just boil down to what we as a society think the role of government should be? It's not a matter of whether government is necessary - which it clearly is vis-a-vis foreign aggressors - it's just a mater of the role of government and where we choose to draw the line as a society?

sorry, those two movies are completely different - apples and oranges. One is portrayed as a non-fictional representation of actual events. The other is a highly fictional cautionary tale. I don't see how that comparison is relevant to the issue at hand:
"is it ethical to be misleading or lie to combat other lies?"
and the answer to that is obviously "no".
there's nothing wrong with having an opinion and weaving an exaggerated story to represent a fictional future - but if you're lying, being deceiving or intentionally leaving out key details in order to shape someone's perception of something... that's so obviously wrong I don't see how this is still being discussed.

No. I don't believe politicians. I believe in the Rule of Law. Law based on the application of reason. What you're spouting here is not reason. It's dogma and high school economics.
The reason we always ask for some alternatives is because there is a noticeable dearth of them.
Let's just start with a pretty important one: **How would you settle disputes without some level of violence?** Why is state violence any worse than privatized violence? Why is a monopoly of violence (derived from a democratic process) bad? I'd rather choose my mafia, wouldn't you?
@_date: 2015-07-13 23:51:44


OOH OOH. I have an idea:
What if we all sat down and wrote up a list of things we all agreed we shouldn't do to each other (anything not on that list is ok). Of course, we would have to be able to change those rules because of technology, personal opinions, etc. There are some things that are like...really important. We shouldn't be able to change those rules because they're basically essential to human beings.
It's going to be hard for everyone to agree to every single rule because everybody is different and everyone has different motivations and desires so we'll have to compromise - you know, cooperating.
Ok - we should probably have some way to make sure nobody is breaking the rules or else 1)whats the point of having them 2)people who break the rules will have an unfair advantage. So rule enforcement seems necessary. We'll also need a way to sort out whether or not someone is indeed breaking the rules. Maybe some sort of committee or group of people will be able to sort through the evidence and decide if someone is breaking the rules.
We'll need some way to punish those who try to game the system. If gaming the system is risk free, why would anyone not attempt to game it? We'll need some way to set someone back - like a game of shoots and ladders. This will probably have to be mandatory. No one is going to voluntarily give up their freedom - which at the end of the day is all you have. 
I have a few more ideas but I think that's a pretty good start.

what if some of us want to live in those societies? That makes the people, like you, who use the services - directly and indirectly - and refuse to pay for them the thieves*.
You see? Maybe some of us aren't completely delusional and see those things as inherently good. Maybe money is wasted and things aren't as efficient as we'd like it - but the principle that there is an authority figure available to settle disputes and level the playing field - an elected authority - is a very fucking good idea. 
And anyway, you people who come up with this crazy bullshit never have any solutions either. Please explain in detail how the world will move from how it is now to your crazy fantasy?

I agree that's a tough one - because personally I have objections to our wars of late. BUT - if anything, that's a failure of our laws and tax code, not of failure of *Law*. For example, we have laws that exempt people from military service for ethical reasons.

the amount of silly strawmen examples r/bitcoin comes up with daily is just maddening. how many times have you ever not been allowed to send funds to someone? please. name one time where you weren't allowed to make a transaction. when is that ever an issue?

now, are you probably going to double check you're sending it to the right address? probably. not always. you're probably going check the shit out of it for a $50,000,000 transaction... 
....but then there's of course the chance - the slim chance - of something malicious happening...

Just because something has gone up in price doesn't mean 1) it can't go back down 2) that it's a good store of value

...in that time even if it drops 0.001% you've just lost $500.

....yeah, that cleared everything up.
let's just recap (let's also assume the pizza delivery person is the owner of the pizza and not a guy being paid to do a job)
the buyer offered $6 of cash or X amount of bitcoin. That means $6 was more valuable to the pizza guy that X amount of bitcoin. Or put another way, the buyer needed to offer much more bitcoin for the pizza delivery guy to pick the BTC.
Think of this situation like another currency. Even if someone offered me 4 extra dollars worth of Euros I would decline...because I have no use for $4 worth of euros. Nowhere in the US accepts euros and exchanging that amount of money isn't worth my time.
Once we get into the hundreds or thousands of dollars it makes sense. But that's so little money nobody gives a shit.

then ask yourself what they plan on doing with $50,000,000 in bitcoin?
then ask yourself what's going to happen when they try to spend all that money/exchange it for cash - if they're not supposed to have it.....
now ask yourself, why we have a system where moving large amounts of money is scrutinized?

you're completely ignoring what i'm asking about. well. not really.... you admit the very point i'm trying to make you pay attention to.


Exactly. It doesn't do shit. It's only as legally binding as people think it is, without courts.
I don't care about how they raise money (p.s. you think kickstarting secret ideas is a good idea? i have my doubts you're a design engineer.)
I don't care about trademarks.
I'm talking about protection. Patents protect ideas and help ensure the money you put into an idea will be protected after the product is made - whether it's raised form VC, kickstarter, crowdfund, your grandma, whatever. 
I don't see how cryptography will help that in any way. At the end of the day it's just some code on a computer. Which doesn't mean shit when there are billions of dollars on the line

No. Not really. I don't know what material you're reading to give you these ideas but technology is moving faster than it ever has been.

i love how the term SJW is basically only used by the people who *aren't* SJWs.
It's right up there with "hipster" and "libtards"
No one labels themselves as SJWs. people just throw the term around when they want to disagree with an opinion that they can't actually combat.
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:18:28
That's all well and good.
But that's not what I'm asking. How will cryptography prevent me from manufacturing something or something similar to that which Apple has the patent to? It will still have to go to court. Patents aren't just a piece of paper that guarantees only you can manufacture something. A patent is just a ticket to court. You still have to fight your case in court. 
My point is: Maybe this will streamline the patent creation and patent filing process, but it won't make patents or patent legal battles obsolete.

i'm not sure. i definitely understand it. it's easy to look at the world and think it's stacked against you. 
it *is* stacked against most people. 
r/bitcoin has the right idea. The financial industry *is* rotten. I, personally, don't see how bitcoin can will fix it - especially given how bitcoin is arguably more corrupt than the industry r/bitcoin wants to take down.
Regardless, the general idea is good. However, like any movement (be it Tea partiers, OWS) the loudest voices are the dumbest ones.
There is also a certain amount of confirmation bias. People look at the over the last few years and see it as vindication that bitcoin is becoming mainstream, when in reality just more people exactly like themselves have discovered bitcoin.
I run a business centered around bitcoin. I have information about my customers and I can tell you this: They're all white or asian men between 18-30. All of them.
I don't know what that means, but I think it means something.

government overreach is one thing...but to say money laundering laws are a bad idea is fucking nonsense.

so you're saying i should be able to take money from the commission of a crime and give it to you to hide, knowing it's ill gotten gains.... and you shouldn't be punished....?
you're saying someone who pushes money through a fake business in order to either evade taxes or conceal profits from some illegal activity......that shouldn't be a crime.....? 
.....what planet are you people living on?
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:32:44
ok. then don't say "money laundering is not in itself a crime"
it most definitely is. No one, including the government, is saying money laundering isn't or shouldn't be a crime (except MortuusBestia and people on this thread)

This is like saying "Hey I just drove the car to the bank. They stole the money. Driving isn't illegal!"
Yeah, no shit. Driving isn't illegal, but you're party to a crime.
Just like if you're moving money around for drug dealers or terrorists. You're party to crimes. Just because moving money is legal doesn't mean you can do it to/from wherever you want without penalty.

@_date: 2015-02-02 16:07:23
.......ok? isn't that how every crime is prosecuted? if they suspect you of a crime they charge you with it? 
i think you have a warped sense of the legal system (probably spend way too much time on r/bitcoin) if you think people are just thrown in jail without due process.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:46:15
That all may or may not be true. I don't care.
My main point and what this WHOLE THREAD started with is some dumb ass said


Which is, by really any point of view, completely wrong. It's like saying 


fuck, yes it is. Killing someone may not be a crime. But murdering someone definitely is.
@_date: 2015-02-27 14:06:46
Yeah anyone who says insider trading doesn't work or is not profitable has no idea what they're talking about. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:26:14
the point is that there is an incentive to admit to guilt rather than protest your innocence - that's very fucked up.
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:51:27
Right. This whole thing is a semantic issue. 
But if you look down the thread you'll see absolute lunatics who don't think it should be illegal, in any form, to move money around. 
But then asked if it should be illegal to hide money from a burglary they magically remain silent. Or come back with - and this is a quote - "it shouldn't be illegal to hide anything you own"
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:30:18


If someone was murdered with a gun and you knowingly hid that gun so the authorities couldn't find it....should that be legal?
@_date: 2015-02-02 20:10:35
YES. it should exist as a crime! the aiding of someone by concealing their illegal financial transactions is mostly definitely something that should be illegal. why shouldn't that be a crime? why is that so hard for you to understand?
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:13:06
Dude. You have no idea what you're talking about and are saying some things that are flat out wrong.


Yes. Yes it is. Anyone who knowingly hinders a criminal investigation is criminally liable.


No you don't. It is a crime to lie to the police. It is called obstruction of justice.


And this is the problem. You're projecting how you think the world works. But you don't seem to know how the world works. At all.

............committing a crime...like......building homemade explosives?
Would you mind if your neighbor had 12 tanks of sarin gas in his basement? 
Come on, man! He's not going to commit any crimes with it. He just wants to keep it there. For his freedom. He keeps it right next to his homemade explosives. It's fine. He doesn't intend to harm anyone. It's his right to be able to do that. No man-made laws should stop anyone from owning 12 tanks of sarin gas and building homemade bombs in his basement.

I'm getting sick of people thinking bitcoin will solve every problem in the world. 
Right now bitcoin barely solves any problems.
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:01:51
You and MortuusBestia are missing the point.
Moving money around is legal. Moving money around for the sake of concealing illicit activity is illegal - and it has a name: money laundering.
Money laundering is, by definition, the illegal concealing of financial transactions.
Your shoe analogy is fucking terrible. A better one would be: driving on roads is legal but you have to follow the rules: stay in your lane, don't speed etc etc. It *is* for our collective safety. 
If you think otherwise, go ask HSBC and all the other banks moving money around for the cartels.
@_date: 2015-03-03 04:28:47
I think that may have been true 5, 10 years ago. But I can't imagine someone being impressed with sending money to someone with their phone anymore. With apps like venmo and basically all banks having phone payment options, what's the wow factor? In some countries you've been able to send money for free to anyone for years. 
My point is, I don't think first hand use is all that dazzling. There are much better user experiences out there with respect to sending money electronically. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:50:28

@_date: 2015-02-02 18:02:16
while that's probably true, it doesn't seem relevant to the topic at hand.
that is: people don't seem to think that hiding illegal activity shouldn't be illegal.
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:24:44
i guess if you're going to lose a bunch of money, it's more fun to give it away instead of just watching the charts.
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:14:31
direct question: do you know what money laundering is? Because you keep saying things that have nothing to do with money laundering.
People don't launder money through banks. There isn't some form you fill out "are you laundering this money?"
People launder money through fake entities, phony businesses, real estate, cooked books etc.
Nobody launders money at their local Wells Fargo. Money laundering is a criminal activity whereby the illegally obtained money - or legitimately obtained money which you're hiding for tax purposes - is hidden and obscured. Money launderers are basically partners in crime. 


See what I mean? That's not at all how money laundering works.


WHAT?! what the fuck. so I could just send $100,000 to ISIS, right? You think that should be legal?
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:39:00

ok dude. i give up. i've had this same stupid conversation with dumb assholes over and over again and it basically always ends with some inane sophomoric thing like what you just said.
it's basically impossible to have a conversation about laws and regulations with someone who rejects them while obeying and benefitting from them.
It's like trying to tell someone how and why buoyancy is a good thing while they're on a boat. But they hate boats and think everyone would be better off if we were all just swimming.
At some point you just have to walk away.
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:53:38
Ok. How about this:
You are given money stolen in a burglary. You're asked to hide it.
Is that legal?
@_date: 2015-02-16 01:28:51
First of all, the illegality of marijuana is a law surrounding a controlled substance, not a regulation as it pertains to what we're actually talking about. i don't know what that has to do with financial regulations.
The law was written with the *intent* to protect people/public when they thought it did harm. Key word: intent. Ok, it was/is a really bad call in my opinion (others disagree, btw)
But that's 1 law 
There are plenty of really good laws and regulations that make a lot of sense.
Are you going to throw them all out because of one bad one? Does that really make sense to you? Do you not wish to live in a nation of laws?
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:57:25
ok. you've strayed into the r/bitcoin lala land; where laws aren't real and they're just there to keep the sheeple in place.

@_date: 2015-02-03 01:05:04
oooook. i wasn't asking you to explain why drug dealers should/shouldn't be punished. i'm not asking about why taxes shouldn't be a thing.
i'm asking, in very plain english:


please just answer that question.
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:00:11
right, but doesn't that create an incentive for innocent people, if there is enough evidence, to plead guilty to avoid harsher sentences?
doesn't that make our justice/penal system kinda....not fair?
Is that really justice if you're gaming the system? Justice shouldn't be about financial cost.
I'm pretty sure they don't have plea bargaining in other legal systems for that exact reason. Seems very very fucked up.
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:31:27
god. it's a fucking joke dude. 
as is everything you think. you're a joke. you're whole ideology is a joke. it's truly laughable. 
serious question: how old are you? 
if you were 14 I could understand it. I had some really dumb ideas about the world when i was 14. I was told I would grow out of them and i didn't believe it. I thought i'd stay true to my delusions. But then i was exposed to the real world and grew the fuck up.
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:47:26
Again, not the banks fault.....they're just doing what 1) they as a business have chosen to do 2) you have agreed to. 
If it is indeed a disputed charge that you didn't authorize then it won't be an overdraft   
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:03:09
....other side? that's just parroting the same dumb shit logic i've been hearing all day. that somehow it should be legal to move money around for the purposes of concealing illicit activity.
i'm all for legally moving money around without the government knowing. 
but that's not what we're talking about, is it? as the author says 


which is and should undeniably be illegal. seriously. can someone please give me a good reason why it should be legal to move money in order to evade tax obligations (without going into that r/bitcoin bullshit about taxes being robbery) or other legal penalties 
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:54:30
Cashing? Yeah i could probably do that. I'd probably need to tell them in advance so they had the bills ready. And probably need to sign a bunch of things so the bank isn't liable for theft - but I could probably do it. Again, my GF took out $10,000 to pay for a motorcycle once. No problems there. I think you have a warped sense of.....the world? to be honest. I think you think it's a very different place.


Yeah and that's fucking insanity. You think drug dealers, cartels, tax evaders, illegal casinos.... anyone wishing to hide the source of their money should be able to just give it to someone to launder and that should be perfectly legal...... No one should go to jail (or fined or whatever) for that? And if so, why should that be legal to do?
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:17:41

.....my girlfriend deposits a check for $30,000 every year from her grandparents. They never bat an eye.


ok dude. you're not even talking about money laundering. which is what this thread is about. you're just talking about banking and there are all sorts of regulations for all sorts of reasons that are perfectly reasonable. If you think they're too invasive, don't use them.
But don't try to argue that banks are too invasive, therefore money laundering should be legal.

@_date: 2015-02-02 17:29:18
right....thats a problem for sure.
....but that doesn't mean money laundering shouldn't be illegal. which was the very first thing I said.

@_date: 2015-02-05 01:48:17
i've always thought that's kinda fucked up - that just because you protested your guilt you're punished more. Isn't that like....your right?

oh my fucking god. you're pathetic.
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:46:03
If you knowingly hid the gun used in a murder - would that be legal?
If you knowingly hid the money stolen in a burglary - would that be illegal?
Why? It's just moving money, man. That in itself isn't a crime!!
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:45:26
i guess that definition is more appropriate, you're right.
it is the concealing of illegal activity - which makes it illegal. like hiding the gun used in a crime. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:11:33

 so laws enacted to protect the public from, say, lunatics (like yourself) with homemade weapons do actually matter to you and you admit that they're probably a good idea.

@_date: 2015-02-02 18:25:16
so....therefore money laundering should be legal? because it's easier to pretend to be ignorant something shouldn't be illegal?
*It's easier to launder money therefore it should be legal** 
Please explain why it should be legal to conceal illegal flows of money.
That's really all i want to hear.
@_date: 2015-02-15 23:26:35
please tell the assholes over at this.
people are freaking out over this. i say "who gives a shit?"
i've never heard of any of these exchanges - why would your average person care?
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:53:16
....at this stage, yes.
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:29:32
because 95% over 100 years is negligible - even desirable, by some. 100 years isn't a person's financial lifetime. Annually, it's a very small amount  - which is usually offset by investing. I don't really care about 3% inflation when my money, in the form of investments, is making me 8% per year. And guess what, neither does anyone else. A small amount of inflation is good. Call me a shill or whatever, but you need it to spur investment.
losing or even gaining that much or more in such a short period of time like a month or year (like bitcoin has) is a really bad thing for a currency/financial tool. It makes it basically un-useable. That's why companies cash out to dollars. They can't afford to hold bitcoin.
how can companies plan for the future when their potential revenue streams may collapse? how or why would anyone plan to save money knowing that their savings could be wiped out by some early adopter cashing out?
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:51:14
it's called shorting.
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:19:11
no, dude. I just live in the fucking real world. I'm not a statist, whatever the fuck that means.
something that fucking wingnut anarcho-libertarian assholes don't seem to understand: 
**privacy and freedom have to exist with the rule of law.** they cannot exist separately. one hand washes the other.
 
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:35:01
dude. you're comparing shoes and cutlery to thousands or millions of dollars. do you not see how ridiculous that is? at some point the analogy doesn't work. there is a reason we can about the flow of large amounts of money - because it buys other things...drugs, guns, bribes etc.
also, what are you talking about? At large scales the flow of items like petroleum and cars are very much regulated and scrutinized. 1 gallon of gas? Who cares? A tanker full of petroleum - mountains of legal procedures....
i don't really see how money laundering laws have anything to do with wikileaks. i think you need to go research what money laundering actually is, how it works, and why people do it.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:20:43
It's not. That's why banks don't ask me where my paycheck comes from every month. They don't ask me where my $50 check from my grandparents come from.
But they're not *laundering my money*. This thread is about laundering money. 
We're talking about concealing the source of illegally obtained money. Which, if you're doing so knowingly, is illegal. And generally, people who are laundering money are fully aware that they're doing so - because they're likely making a profit.
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:28:24
................yeah. that's why I'm completely destitute and I only have 5% of my wealth from my salary.
you people need to learn some context.
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:16:59
please explain to me why we shouldn't have a law that says something like 




please explain to me why those shouldn't exist (without retreating to the r/bitcoin trope that "taxes are robbery, man")
@_date: 2015-02-15 23:16:39
jeez. i don't know where to begin....
so i wont. it will be a waste of both our time. 
but i recommend you ask yourself why we have regulations surrounding pharmaceuticals in the first place. it will clear up a lot of misunderstandings you clearly have about regulations, what they are for, who they protect etc...
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:52:40
No. No I'm not.
I'm simply  saying that money laundering should be illegal.
You, and everyone else, seem to think money laundering is simply moving money around. 
It's not. Money laundering is a very specific case of moving money around. That is, in order to conceal illicit activity.
Setting up a fake business to conceal legitimate transactions, while really weird and may have weird tax problems, isn't money laundering.
@_date: 2015-02-27 12:58:25
Yes. And the creepiness is only magnified here 
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:48:09


...............what? money laundering - hiding the trail of illicitly attained funds is most definitely a crime - and it should be.
If you're claiming that "money laundering" is now defined as moving money around to mask legitimate financial maneuvers for the sake of privacy - well, then you're simply changing the definition of money laundering to something that is already legal.
Money laundering, as most people know it, is a legitimately illegal act.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:30:08
..........*faggot*? seriously?
well that explains a lot. if you're so fucking stupid as to use homophobic slurs in 2015 i shouldn't expect too much from you.
nothing says my argument is stronger than calling someone a faggot. good job.
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:46:05
eh. i'm not going to bother. no matter what i say you won't listen or change your mind. i've had this conversation a few dozen times this year and it's always the same (hence "you people")
i spelled out pretty clearly the difference between 95% in 100 years (~3% annually) and -80% annually.
Honestly, if you can't see for yourself why those are different or why one might be a larger problem than the other, i don't think you'll understand (or want to understand) what I have to say.
so good luck giving away $75, sounds like a great idea.
@_date: 2015-02-01 21:35:59
right back atcha.
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:22:21
sounds like the typical, reasonable reaction from an r/bitcoin-er
@_date: 2015-02-01 21:06:08
ok. well if we're going to 5 year time frame then use a 5 year time frame. the dollar has not lost 95% in 5 years, and compared to other currencies it is up.
which is what my original comment "you people need to learn some context" meant.
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:13:43
ok? i don't get your point. 
corruption can happen in established and regulated markets. ok? 
this just in: water wet, sky blue.
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:25:26
....thanks for explaining plea bargaining. i was totally unaware how it worked.
my point is that it's sometimes better for you to take a lesser punishment and admit guilt rather than attempt to prove your innocence - which is totally fucked up.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:05:12


For the last fucking time. Yes. Money laundering *is* a crime because you're aiding in the commission of a crime. You're knowingly helping someone commit a crime. That is and should be illegal.
If I give you money I stole and you decide to hide it for me. That's a crime. You're aiding in the commission of a crime. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 01:51:26


First of all, that's not true. My bank doesn't give a fuck who is depositing money into my account. They just need verification from the other bank that those funds are in there.
What's more, there are escrow services for this very purpose.
anyway, let's say that is true. how are your rights violated by the government in that instance? 
the banks are private institutions..... what's more, they already know (probably better than you) your financial information...how has your privacy been affected?
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:35:26
[let me do it for you.](
oh, look. none...yet.
it will probably stay that way. you know why? publications print things people want to read. they write things that will drive traffic. 
nobody cares about bitcoin - much less some garage exchange losing peanuts worth of money.
let me know when you find a major outlet talking about this event.
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:41:50
.......it...kinda did already. at least the most recent bubble.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:17:32


.........because it's a crime! I can't say why something is a crime more than saying it is a crime. It's fact. Go look it up.
It is illegal to use, transmit, store or hold money obtained from a crime. What more do you want?
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:34:56
You're being really inconsistent.




............so which is it? Is it legal to send money to anyone, anywhere....or should I be prosecuted for aiding terrorists?
And if I'm being arrested for sending money to them, shouldn't I be prosecuted if I received money from them, say, to launder it?
Seems your beef is with privacy, not legality. You can have both, you know. I don't think you people realize that you can have laws and privacy.....
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:26:00
...that's why you don't store your bitcoins on coinbase.

i'm very dubious of that claim. source?
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:28:07
This. I bought some, then talked my girlfriend wanted to buy some so she set up an account. I wanted to buy more that same day but couldn't so i just got her to buy some for me.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:30:20
1 central bank creates dollars. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:14:34
so played out.
we done with this yet, guys?
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:04:13
this is still a thing that is funny?
