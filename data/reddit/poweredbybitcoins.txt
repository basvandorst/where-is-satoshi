It's nice to see BTC as a payment option but other than the ability to pay with BTC and a competitive commission structure, this is basically just another stock photo agency. I'm hoping for something in the photo arena that actually takes advantage of the blockchain. What I want....an app or widget that integrates with something like Joystream.co and allows the first 5 ( or more or less ) purchasers of my image to become partners, each earning a royalty interest (1%, 5%, 10%???) in future stock sales of that image. That would be disruptive, essentially eliminating the need for middlemen stock photo agencies. Also encourages initial sales of the image. Payments run off the blockchain - then it automatically gets redistributed to royalty holders BTC addresses. The download from the distributed database via Joystream.co (or whoever) is immediate for the purchaser. Just a thought.

It's temporary, just like all the other times. But if you're not selling does it really matter? Just another opportunity to sell the wife, kids and dog and load up on more : )

Well I bought last recently at $288. If I was interested in selling I would be making money. So clearly, not the only people making money are shorting Bitcoin. And as a matter of fact, most of the shorts in the last 24 hours will be covering before Monday, making now a good time to buy - before they cover.

So what happened to the comp bonus? This really doesn't bode well for a new service.

If I had 20,000 Bitcoin to sell, which I was actually interested in selling, would I put up a wall like this to sell them? No, I would not.
There is a very good possibility this seller is also a buyer on the other side. Picking up whatever they can below $300.

Bitcoin trading is not resuming as it never stopped - not even for one day. The largest and original Bitcoin exchange, Bahtcoin, never missed a beat and continues to this day. I know - I've used them numerous times BEFORE and AFTER this so called ban. Glad to see a new exchange though, competition is always good.
@_date: 2014-01-16 12:27:17
The banks have no more influence over Bitcoin than the recording industry does over torrents. And that's by design.
They will make an effort to regulate and control it, attempting to make Bitcoin fit into their legacy system.
The survivors in the banking industry will be those early movers who try and fit into the Bitcoin paradigm, not the other way around.
In 1-3 years we'll see who needs who more.
@_date: 2014-10-26 03:20:58
Banks open Monday, people get paid before the week is out. We'll see how brave the shorts are in the face of that. And yes, in the big picture, things are moving along nicely.

Difficult to say. But I wouldn't want to be shorting right now. It can go up a lot quicker than it goes down.

It's coming, be patient.

Effective lobbying by the horse racing industry many years ago. Personally, I don't understand why it isn't all legal by default. With things like betting on dogfights made illegal with very stiff penalties. Victimless gaming? None of the governments business. Take your taxes and keep your nose out of it.

Well I read your "The Truth". There is nothing in there leading me to believe Roger lied about anything. So your claim of him being a known liar seems to be a .....lie. Nice try though.
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:50:25
Agreed. But with the launch of numerous Sidechains, some possibly extremely practical to large segments of the population, you'll see massive new numbers compared to 2014.

@_date: 2014-10-25 16:00:11
With such confidence I'm rather surprised you haven't acted on your prediction by shorting. Sounds like a sure thing to me.
@_date: 2014-12-21 16:18:57
As Bitcoin keeps being defined by authorities to reflect their interests, I think it's important we just keep pushing ahead and create our own narrative - and define it our way. My contribution is   Still just beginning but have plans for better stuff as time permits.
@_date: 2014-12-11 04:54:32
Probably the simplest way to get $5 in Bitcoin (since you didn't stipu
late buy) is to post something for sale. Either offer a product or service people may want.
@_date: 2014-10-06 03:18:56
IMO what's being done is a classic junior market sweep. And now that we have the Siblerts, Drapers and Winklvii involved, you have the investment community involved to some degree. This is how it's done. Paralyze the fence sitters from buying, scare the timid into selling, tighten that float.
@_date: 2014-11-30 13:07:58
Well done! If just a few more people did this mainstream media would jump all over it and essentially give $millions of dollars in free publicity to WU......and Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:53:09
I think we'll see something in the coming year. In EPISODE 99 LTB, Adam Hill states " So we’ll be releasing software very quickly that is necessary software for bootstrapping this type of ecosystem. There’s a couple different parts of the existing blockchain and Bitcoin ecosystem that have huge gaping problems that we can deliver immediate value without needing to wait the 12, 18, or 24 months that it might take to get some of these changes adopted in Bitcoin core. Some people are aware of these problems, but we feel that we can deliver immediate value based off that. "
So maybe we won't see any full blown Sidechains in the next 12 months - but it sounds like we'll at least see some major contributions to the eco system. And I wouldn't personally bet against NOT seeing any Sidechains implemented in 2015.
@_date: 2014-12-16 08:06:35
Yup, an even better bargain. Sweet.

Naturally, if a person received Bitcoin all year and hung on to it, paper losses would be painful. I'm guessing most people receiving Bitcoin for services rendered are not your average Joe and are probably in it for the long haul. I could be wrong.

You say the only way to make money is by shorting. Then in the next breathe you say you'll be buying at a lower price. So is it shorting or buying? Please advise us.
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:20:42
If you're getting paid in Bitcoin, other than what you hold in long term savings, you would be converting reasonably quick to pay your bills in fiat. Your long term holdings wouldn't be sold now so it wouldn't make much difference what the price does over the course of a year. On the other hand, when we're back in a long term upward trend, it would be painful getting paid in fiat and waiting for a pullback before you buy. We know how that works out when Bitcoin is rising.

And another quote by her which seems currently appropriate.
" We are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion: the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases, while the citizens may act only by permission; which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history, the stage of rule by brute force. "

I don't believe this is about China limiting access to Bitcoin, that's old news which was largely already factored into the market.
The news yesterday was simply a convenient tool to help trigger and mask a concerted effort to take Bitcoin down to a more agreeable price for a new round of buyers - buyers who generally don't pay retail : )
Just my 2 cents.

If it had simply been called Internet Money, we would be much further along in adoption - IMO. Internet Money wouldn't have needed any explanation, the name says it all.
Yes, I understand that doesn't explain the payment system, contracts etc...nor does the name Bitcoin.

If that were true, China would be leading the sell off - but that's not been the case.
I view this more like a small cap stock play - when a sell off is this well orchestrated across multiple exchanges, it's not by chance, it's by design.
If over the next 1-2 weeks we see a significant price hike you'll be looking back knowing who was doing all the buying when retail was selling.
@_date: 2014-11-21 04:10:15
What will be of significantly more interest long term is who's buying up everything hitting the market now.

If you take out the the beginning of your headline and simply put " Does opening a bitcoin casino help bitcoin? ", the answer is obviously yes. Any exposure and activities help move things forward.
Why it would make a difference to you if it is Roger or somebody else opening a casino isn't really relevant.
Having said that, kudos to Roger for stepping up and pushing the ball forward...once again.

I predict you will see many more VC firms investing in Bitcoin startups in the coming year. Not unlike the hotel industry, where if one hotel invests in implementing wifi, all other local properties will do the same. VC firms can't afford to tell their investors the other guys hit a 100 X homerun but we missed the game. With more investment coming into Bitcoin startups, it also increases the likelihood of broader adoption as more apps hit the market from the start ups. 2014 will be a great year for Bitcoin, don't let the current noise fool you.
