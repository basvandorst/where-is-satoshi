Wish I saw this a few weeks ago... and again a couple days ago :( 1 BTC to 0.6 BTC in a handful of dumb decisions. I just want to get back to 1 but I keep dropping further.

I think he means the past volume at Mt.Gox was so high it is still outranks many of the newer players in total volume, even though it is no longer operational.

Just throw a 1 in front of that.

I've been dabbling in that as well, but just don't know which alts have enough potential without also being already hyped/pumped.

From what I can gather, yes.

I appreciate the sentiment and everything but... You're doing exactly the number one thing you shouldn't be doing in investing. Acting on emotion rather than logic.

A lot of young folks are making a lot of money because they're young enough to absorb the risks that comes with the territory. For someone like you much closer to retirement I can't think of a worse investment than bitcoins. The risks far outweigh the gains. Yes you can make it big. But what happens if it all goes downhill and you panic sell, or can't wait it out until the next wave? How will you take care of your wife then? Please carefully take the time to consider the risks at stake.

It's not risk inherent to bitcoin. You could do the same with any other commodity by hoarding it. I'm just saying that it's probably more easily executed on bitcoins than with something like gold since the total value of the market is so much lower as well as more actively traded.  
But then again, I just took a look at the number of bitcoins out there. It'd cost $1 billion to obtain half of them at the average price of $200 each. So I guess the chances of someone trying to pull it off is unlikely.
Ninja edit: Nothing special about 51%. I was just reusing the percentage the OP used.
Real edit: Ohhh I think there was some confusion. When I say "he" in my original post, I meant my parent poster. I know what your talking about with the 51% computing power. It was in the original paper. My bad.

He wasn't talking about 51% of the mining power (which I agree would be very difficult if not impossible). He's talking about owning 51% of the available bitcoins, essential gaining a monopoly in setting its value. While not likely, someone wealthy enough could attempt at doing this. Although not without driving up the price simultaneously.

Dude, I'm fairly new to this whole concept as well but look where you're posting before you make a decision. Are you so easily convinced because a dozen redditors in a *bitcoin* subreddit implied that it'll provide returns?  
If I were to ask you right now (without you having to re-read or look anything up) why you'd invest in bitcoins, could you give me an answer? If not then all you're doing is basing your actions on the enthusiasm of others. And if the past has taught us anything, people can be very wrong (see the .com bubble).  
Do your own research like I intend to. Find out if you believe in the philosophy and if you believe in the probability of its success. Don't just follow the advice of some strangers on the internet (except for me).  
Maybe give this a read:

Can somebody please explain something for me? Why are there poster with $10 million or so in bit coins not cashing out? Are they gambling on the hopes of bitcoins appreciating in even more value in the coming years? If they truly believe that bitcoins will increase so much, wouldn't that then leave all non/late-adopters in the dust?  
Are bitcoin adopters foreseeing a future that bitcoins displace the current monetary system?
Don't get me wrong, I've very jealous and bitter that I didn't invest in bitcoins when I happened to come across them years ago... but surely this can't be anything but a bubble? Based on the 11 million bitcoins in circulation today appraised at $140 a piece, that makes $1.5 billion that emerged from essentially nothing. Then again I suppose $1.5 billion is hardly a dent in the net capital of an entire country but still, it just seems crazy to me.  
Could some early adopter and true believer please educate me on what the end goal is?
