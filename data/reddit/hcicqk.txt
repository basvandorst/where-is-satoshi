Hi Andreas
First of all, great talk on Joe Rogan. You can really articulate on your subjects.
Since I know you are open to critics, allow me to point a few things on your argument confrontation:
Sometimes (I don't know if there's a name or a kind of logical fallacy) you didn't respond to Joe's question, instead, pointed other bigger problems. Now, let me say, you're not wrong in pointing that, but ALSO you would want to respond the question directly, for example:
- When Joe asked about bitinstant arrest, shady business etc., you pointed to big banksters crooks;
- Other question was about speculation and pump and dumps on the bitcoin, and you pointed out other huge markets that are rigged (and talked that at least the currency is not manipulated, great point). Nothing wrong with pointing other problems, but you got to answer the question as well. In this case, in my opinion, speculation helps liquidity, it allows people that can buy or sell bitcoins at the market price. It helps hedging, a basic feature of mature markets, that allow people who don't want to be exposed to the volatility, by using those same hedge tools, by finding always some people betting on the bitcoin price. A bet is a gentleman's agreement (non-violent), in my view.
This happened three times, *(out of 2h30m, that's good enough!!) that I can remember. Now mind you, you are great talker, and I know you want to perfect your skills. And I even think you just didn't remembered some arguments.
I give this talk a 9.8/10. :-)
