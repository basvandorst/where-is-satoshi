I just think of all my USD in BTC instead.

You vote republican, don't you?
See what I just did there?

You're an idiot. Coinbase is awesome. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 05:10:16
I also find your style very interesting. seems like a fucking idiot. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:50:11
I do. Its really quite profitable.

Well I'm not a Libertarian at all and it is still plainly obvious to me why I would want the option of having a financial system that they cannot regulate. 
In America our national government has proven to be quite inept at regulating just about every financial system they touch, which has created a large wealth inequality and isolated the middle class. I don't think believing that Bitcoin could remedy this is inherently libertarian in nature, but instead the common reaction to any idea that promotes decentralization and less regulation is labeling it as a libertarian idea.

Take a look at 42 coin and 365 coin. 
Theoretically any coin can be split into infinitely small parts, however as a marketing strategy that would be a bad decision, since generally people don't want to own small fractions of coins.
If $20 is equal to 0.000000003 in ____coin, while $20 is also equal to 45,000 DOGE, which coin would you rather use?

When the value of Bitcoin drops, that means it is time to buy.
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:50:26
Yes you should, just start slow and get a feel for the market. When I started buying Bitcoin I just bought in small $8.00-ish increments every few days until I had a better understanding of how it works. 
Someone who bought or mined 50 Bitcoins back in Feburary of 2013 would have made around $21,000 in profits at today's prices, or approximately $60,000 at its peak back in December. A 50 Bitcoin purchase in February of 2013 was only about $1,500.
Bitcoin can be used to make a quick buck or two, but its real value is its presence as a potential alternative to the current financial system which is dominated by governments and giant corporate banking groups. 
The price of the coin is going to likely continue being volatile for a while, so it is never wise to invest more money than you're willing to lose. If you live in the US I recommend setting up an account with Coinbase to purchase some Bitcoin. You can really only lose as much as you put in, so just keep track of the fiat you spend and don't sell when the price suddenly falls a little and you will be fine!

Am. It's not easy

These are not your typical students, these students are going to be some of our top future innovators in a few years. Just introducing the entire school to Bitcoin could have some amazing effects a few years down the road.

You're pretty.
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:47:00
You would be right, if this hadn't ever happened before and "real" money was actually being lost. 
Times like these are opportunities. Buy buy buy!

Your reasoning makes me peg you as a intelligent individual whose opinion I would value. \sarcasm
You're oversimplifying very complex situations using a few tidbits of information that you know in hindsight. To claim that the dotcom bubble caused the devalue of the USD *and* inflation shows how little you understand the entire situation. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:13:08
Double digits would be pretty unlikely in my opinion, however if it does happen I will be buying the entire way down.
Hell I will probably buy on the way back up too...
@_date: 2014-05-01 06:50:45
I'm skeptical.

The best thing the bitcoin community could do in such a situation is to ignore what naysayers say and continue promoting Bitcoin for what it actually is: a new financial system. 
As long as people continue using Bitcoin for legitimate purposes the government will not succeed. In fact, of the two things being discussed in this speculation, I would say trust in the government is much more socially unacceptable than Bitcoin is, and I think any attempts at reversing that would cause a massive amount of people call bullshit on the US government.
