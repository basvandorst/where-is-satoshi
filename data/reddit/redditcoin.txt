2 years ago I was a victim of MtGox and went through a similar experience - lost hundreds of BTC, and had to sell my home, and was in a dark place. I'm now mod of and have moved on with my life, helping other victims attempt to recover what little possible from the bankruptcy. 
Before doing anything rash, wait. Put things in perspective - you still are the father of 4 kids who need you. Also, you don't know the future and what you might get back through legal proceedings/ bankruptcy. Plus, life goes on, and there are other ways to make back the losses - I know I have already.

The fact that they are being moved and divided up makes it less and less a positive sign that gox has found their coins, and increases the likelihood of nefarious reasons for the movement (whether it's insider theft or external hackers).

A bitcoin exchange is really a license to print money (bitcoins) so it's possible.
@_date: 2014-03-21 07:41:11
Hi Andy
I agree with you and see it as a matter of perspective. When gox crashed I wrote off all my holdings on it. So from that point of view I saw that as bad news. The fact that they found 200k btc from a "lost" wallet is better than finding nothing but overall I agree the news is still bad. I still expect zero back fr gox but if I get anything I will see it as an unexpected bonus. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:46:38
The price is likely to drop further I think. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 07:10:23

Thanks for the feedback. It means a lot to me as I'm keen to contribute to the Bitcoin community. I have only recently acquired the domain name and implemented this idea on it to fill a need of my own that I identified. The idea is to demystify bitcoin addresses so that people like my mum can use them, and easily allow sharing on social media like Facebook for the non-technical masses. 
In relation to your questions: Anonymous users won't be able to update their addresses. However, registered users will be able to do so however at any time. 
I'm open to suggestions as to how to improve the idea and minimize risks. I'm thinking of adding an email notification to registered accounts everything a change occurs for example.

Accompanying FAQ:
Interesting one:
Q. What will be happen to the business of the bitcoin exchange operated by the Company?
A. It has not been decided yet, but after the bankruptcy proceedings commence, it will be unlikely
that the Company can restart the exchange. The treatment of the exchange business is expected to
be decided taking into consideration the various matters including whether there is any proper buyer
candidate who can assume the business and how to transfer the business to such buyer.

Note that a lot of people split up their bitcoin balances between multiple wallets in cold storage (e.g. 10 wallets with 10 btc instead if 1 wallet with 100 btc) to spread the risk so I suspect there are a lot more people in the higher value range than known.

I blame the courts. Re creditor input they can easily set up a secure online voting website to seek the views of the creditors. That's the only way to cover so many people. A creditors meeting in person is just not practical. And at the moment decisions are just being made for us without our real input or views.

I think the term "goxcoin" has too much history and negative connotations to it as it's an existing term used by bitcoinbuilder already. 
Why not call these "gox shares" instead or leave the name gox behind and call them "community exchange shares" or "cxs" - as that's their intent - shares in a new community exchange that can themselves be traded like any other shares.

Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has received a subpoena from federal prosecutors in New York, according to a person familiar with the matter, dealing another blow to the embattled marketplace for buyers and sellers of the virtual currency.
Mt. Gox, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges, shut down on Tuesday, underscoring the risks of bitcoin, the virtual currency that has seen a meteoric rise in the past year. The subpoena was sent this month and asked Mt. Gox to preserve certain documents among other things, the person said.

G'day mate! Aussie here too. Quite a few prominent bitcoiners from down under although it is still niche here. Localbitcoins is a good place to trade as mentioned. The Australian Tax Office is considering a ruling on bitcoin so the outcome of that will be interesting. There is also an Australian sub at but it's not very active. There are a few bitcoin "exchanges" but they are really just online wallets where you can buy btc such as coinjar and others. There is talk of an ATM from the winkle twins I think as well in Melbourne but that remains to be seen. Hope this helps. :)

If it takes a year to be paid back from Gox, that is still better than zero - I think most Gox users will be happy to assume that they have stored their btc in cold storage for a year, and the value would probably have gone up. Fiat holders in Gox may be in a worse off position however.

Hi all
I'm a relatively newcomer to the Bitcoin community. I've always felt that one of the shortfalls of using Bitcoin is the difficulty in remembering and communicating the long bitcoin wallet addresses. I thought that there should be a way of shortening the wallet addresses somehow into an easy to remember format, which can easily be shared with people. 
I am aware of a couple of address shorteners around, but felt that there is still a need for something a bit more functional. I decided to create a site for myself to use, and to share it with other bitcoin users as well -  - essentially a place where I can put all my multiple bitcoin addresses into the one place, and have each of them associated with a unique easy to remember customised URL, that I can share with others. 
I made it so that the service works even if you don't register as an anonymous user, but it also allows you to register an account so you can actually modify the address pages you create, create bundles of addresses for different purposes and keep track of private addresses and statistics.
I've worked on the site a bit over the past few days as I'm on leave from work, and decided to make it public after a few days of testing. It seems to work fine for me, and suits my needs - let me know if you think it works for you as well. I'm open to suggestions. :)

I recall that only fiat holders were counted as creditors in the initial bankruptcy application - this makes me worried that liquidation is only to pay fiat holders and btc holders get nothing.

For me, as an Australian, MtGox was the only major exchange denominated in AUD. Plus it was meant to be the oldest and most established. Plus it was a Bitcoin Foundation gold member. Plus it's CEO was on the Bitcoin Foundation Board. Plus it had good volume of trading (I have verified accounts in most other exchanges but liked the gox interface). As a relative newbie I wasn't aware of the history. So I got goxxed badly. There you have it. I invested in a high risk currency and got burned. I take full responsibility. I know better than to do it again that's for sure.

UPDATE REGARDING TRANSACTION HISTORY:
I called the number again (about an hour later) - again, absolutely no waiting - I called again to ask about my transaction history. The same man answered, with the American accent (although sounded Japanese), who spoke impeccable English. He said that the transaction history is still unavailable because the courts still have to "polish" it (whatever that means). I said I needed it for taxation purposes. He replied by saying he will "check on this, and post an update on the website soon".
There you go.

Hang in there - you're not alone - I had 702 btc in gox too, not as savings but for trading - although it sounds like in the end you might have ended up with a bit more. Make sure you have good real life supports around you as you work through this difficult period. I have accepted my bitcoins as gone - part of the risks of investing in a high risk speculative currency - and will move on. All of us have different ways of coping and take different timelines to get there - just remember that life is more than just money - life is about experiences, relationships and love. Don't forget your priorities and remember that all this is only a means to an end, not the end, and only speed bumps in the journey of life and not life itself. Hang in there.

You will now get email notification which will include the IP address of the user each time you do the following:
1. Log in
2. Change account email
3. Change a bitcoin address
4. Change a bitcoin address description
As for the second suggestion about sending messages to address alias owners - that's not hard to do through a simple contact form on the page, but I worry that alias owners might get spammed. I need to think more about how to make it work better.

As someone who has lost a substantial amount of bitcoins in gox, anything that may help recover some of it would receive my support - however, I'm also a realist, and I think this idea, although possibly workable a week ago, may be one step too late, now that the authorities have stepped in and bankruptcy may have been declared. Having said all this, sign me up if this gets off the ground. What have I got to lose after all? :)

Bankruptcy Judge Rejects Complaints Over Potential Mt. Gox Deal
CoinLab Sued Bitcoin Exchange After Their Licensing Agreement Fell Apart
By KATY STECH
A bitcoin business that planned to use the blueprints for the once-successful Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox couldn't convince a bankruptcy judge on Tuesday that an early sale proposal to salvage the frozen exchange is being unfairly executed.
At a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, Judge Stacey Jernigan rejected complaints raised by CoinLab Inc., which has sued Mt. Gox for $75 million after their licensing agreement fell apart and recently complained that a purchase offer from investor group Sunlot Holdings could be forced upon Mt. Gox customers "without any real scrutiny."
At Tuesday's hearing, Mt. Gox's lawyers told Judge Jernigan that a team of financial professionals in charge of the exchange, led by Nobuaki Kobayashi, hasn't committed to the Sunlot deal and is still open to other proposals—statements that seemed to diffuse CoinLab's allegations.
Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in February and suspended trading after announcing that it lost about 850,000 bitcoins, or roughly 7% of the world's bitcoins with a value of $473 million. Mr. Kobayashi may look for buyers for Mt. Gox's technology to raise money for its debts.
In court papers, lawyers for CoinLab, a Seattle business that is trying to make digital currencies like bitcoin more popular, said that it can offer a "more competitive bid" than Sunlot. CoinLab officials said that they might be able to find Mt. Gox's missing bitcoins more cheaply than Sunlot, which is proposing to take a cut of any bitcoins that are recovered.
"If anyone can find the hidden bitcoins, it's us," said CoinLab lawyer Larry Engel at a recent court hearing.
Earlier this year, the Sunlot investor group reached a deal with some creditors that had sued Mt. Gox after the announcement of the missing bitcoins. Under the deal, creditors that include some Mt. Gox customers would get a 16.5% ownership stake in Mt. Gox, split a portion of 200,000 bitcoins that were located in the search and share other bitcoins that may still turn up in the investigation.
The Sunlot group is led by child actor-turned-entrepreneur Brock Pierce and venture capital investors William Quigley and Matthew Roszak.
Buyers and sellers of bitcoin, a virtual currency created in 2009 that some merchants have begun to accept as payment, have used Mt. Gox since 2011. In all, Mt. Gox has about 120,000 customers, including at least 30,701 customers in the U.S., Mr. Kobayashi said in recent court papers.

Interesting bits from Q&amp;A:

**Q2-4 If I disagree with the accepted or rejected amount, what should I do?**
























**Q2-5 My claims were accepted. Do I need to follow any procedures?**






**Q4-1 When will the distribution be made?**














@_date: 2016-02-27 21:40:36
It means your claim is undecided.
From the email:
"On the other hand, if you cannot find your results of approval or disapproval even if you click the icon that states “Confirm the Results of Approval or Disapproval of the Claims”, I reserve my right to approve or disapprove the claims that you filed.  I will conduct further investigations in the future in respect of the Bankruptcy Claims Related to Exchange for which I reserved my right to approve or disapprove this time, by the date of the next investigation of claims that is scheduled for May 25, 2016.  The reason for the reservation of my right to approve or disapprove the claims that you filed may be due to the possibility that the filed amount is greater than the amount of the deposit balance that we are aware of, and in such case, I may request you to change it by decreasing the filed amount.  If I make such a request, I will approve the filed amount after decreasing it as of the date of the next investigation of claims that is scheduled for May 25, 2016, if you change the filed amount by decreasing it in accordance with such request."
