Neucoin claims they solve "nothing at stake" issue, but Neucoin's existence just perfectly explains what is real "nothing at stake".
To be valuable, a product must be useful and scarce simultaneously, for instance, gold is valuable because of usefulness and scarce, the fresh air, however, is very useful(without it we all die) but not scarce, therefore  the fresh air has no price except in base on Mars or air pollution anywhere which means fresh air is scarce.
What Neucoin has achieved is solving "nothing at stake " WITHIN a certain PoS coin, however, Sunny King (author of PPC)could not stop you rebuild a brand new similar PoS system: Neucoin. This is the problem.
Assume PPC(a good PoS coin) capitalization is one billion USD with thousands internet complete nodes, now Neucoin team(this kind of teams are never scarce too :)) say let's build up a new PoS coins and thousands PPC nodes also like Neucoin and run Neucoin application at same time with PPC software. Because PoS consumes little CPU  computing/power, theoretically, PoS fans can run a lot of similar PoS network at the same time. This time, they are on multi blockchains of different coins, not within one certain PoS. However,  the scarcity cannot stand since a PoS system can be easily duplicated. The result is that PoS coins capitalization is always low, the target---rebuild gold standard on internet---fails.
Satoshi also could not stop bitcoin being copied hundreds times, how many PoW coins now? One thousand? But his BTC succefully maintains scarcity---the quality/security--the 300P hash rate----Is there any PoW alt coin has such high hash rate? NO! 
I like PoS/PoW hybrid system which can utilize both mechanism's merit.

I wish you get a better distribution than PPC within six months.
