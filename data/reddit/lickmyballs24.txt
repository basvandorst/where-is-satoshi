This is great and perfect for people who buy, store, and spend on Coinbase. If I were to send some coins in I purchased elsewhere (MtGox, lol), I wouldn't be able to designate the price I paid. Still very useful, thank you!!

If I bought at $5 and I'm using it at $500, I'm getting a 99% discount. I don't mind paying a legally required portion of that in taxes.
If you bought at $300 and are using at $301, the IRS isn't gonna kick your door down for pennies in unclaimed capital gains.
I don't want to call you a troll, but I also don't see anyone screaming Bitcoin isn't ready for the masses. Have a nice day!

This is free? This is fucking great. Thanks!

It's also illegal to intentionally avoid automatic reporting so um... ignore both of our comments and cash out whatever you need?

I have $870M in Bank. They do not keep that liquid, because that's not how banks work. That money is now fractionally reserve loaned out and otherwise invested. If I say I want $870M in cash tomorrow, or wired to another bank, it will be a very lengthy, complicated process to figure out what assets are attached where through what legacy systems. This requires lawyers and accountants and whole branches of divisions, just so I can fill my Scrooge McDuck swimming pool.
If I have $870M worth of Bitcoin, the blockchain already traces my ownership of these assets back to the block each bitcoin was originally mined. The network verifies those assets are tied to my private key signature, and then sends my money wherever I want for practically pennies.
Granted, it'd still be hard to get a swimming pool of cash, and I'm oversimplifying both of my examples, but you're underestimating what a paradigm shift Bitcoin is as a store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange.

So to get the joke I would have had to assume:
* You didn't open the link
* The NY Times Crossword counts as the main stream media
* The entire mainstream media still thinks Bitcoin is simply "Digital currency used by evil doers," despite Newsweek and the NY Times itself often publishing quite the opposite.
Learn to tell a joke you idiot.

I am not a lawyer or tax professional, but I would like to report all gains as required by my understanding of the law. :-)

To be clear, YouTube made a ton of its original ad revenue in a very similar way. Eventually they had to crack down hard and basically build Content ID to get the courts off their back. Now they're more known for YouTubers.
I don't know what the YouTuber equivalent of a Redditor is, but it'd be amazing if you could incentivize people like or @_date: 2015-11-03 07:50:46
Raising the market cap allowing institutional investors, fiduciary exchanges, and 401ks access to Bitcoin would be a nice benefit to the technology.
We think Bitcoin is cool, and want it to succeed. Part of that is growing, which is reflected in an uptick in price.
Why are you here?

Hi there! Just took a quick glance at your post history;
How often would you say people come into specifically to shit on fountainpens? That seems like it would be counter-productive and a waste of everyone's time, right?

Rampant speculation below:
The Winkevii like Bitcoin, buy a bunch, and then want to resell them to institutions/the general public. An easy way is an ETF. They apply for an ETF, thinking they have enough. Someone asks the question "but where will you get more? You need a fiduciary exchange." Winklevii say "fuck it" and open a fiduciary exchange.
...to the moon?

Just a friendly reminder that we're humans with interests. No need to shit on other people's interests or call people stalkers.
Hope you're having a great day!

Hi Charley,
Do you/Coinbase then track my tax liability? If I purchase bitcoin at $300 and buy a $10 coffee at $600, aren't I liable for $5 in capital gains?
@_date: 2015-11-04 06:16:01


Fine, but the cost still exists, right? The bank isn't a charity. What is the actual cost to the banks to move that much money through their legacy systems securely? More to the point, how much money is the bank making off of holding your money that they're willing to waive those fees?

I really like this idea, but aren't you essentially incentivizing reposters? Which is in turn incentivizing copyright theft? Which in turn brings up some DMCA safe harbor legality questions?

Assuming that I'm holding BTC and it converts to USD at time of purchase
1. What exchange rate is used? Coinbase sell?
1. Who tracks my tax liability? If I bought at $300 usd/btc, and I buy a $5 coffee at $600 usd/btc, do I owe capital gains on $2.50?
1. Returns/exchanges are handled in USD per their [FAQ]( If I buy $1000 of stuff with Bitcoin when the exchange is $1000 usd/btc, if the exchange rate crashes to $100 usd/btc, I could return my item and rebuy 10x my original BTC, correct?
So assuming the exchange rate is fair, and someone is tracking tax liability, this seems like a great way to hedge bets when bitcoin price is high (e.g. early adopter whales can start spending). If the price crashes, return your items and rebuy!

Again, not a lawyer or tax professional. 
My layman understanding is that yes, you could count bitcoin capital losses on a sale. Just beware of wash rules if you plan on re-buying!
@_date: 2015-11-20 18:54:59
i'm not a laywer or tax professional. good luck!

Right. Capital gains doesn't apply if you buy Euros on a trip to Europe and they happen to increase in value. As I've said other places, I'm not a lawyer or tax professional. I feel that my situation (hodling and using Bitcoin at a higher exchange value) may qualify as a capital gain.
The IRS probably isn't going to come after me, but I don't mind paying my fair share on gains. :-)

To reiterate what other people are saying, this sounds shady for a bunch of reasons. Why do you even want cash? Hypothetically, my plan would be to deposit directly into an investment account. I know DriveWealth accepts bitcoin deposits, then I would likely purchase a Vanguard fund and do a transfer in kind to Vanguard. The real estate is also an option.
Bitcoin IS digital cash. Use it to buy the thing you want, not analog cash.
Also pay your taxes and hope you're not on some blacklist of coins. However if you are, attempting to avoid it (and posting on a public forum) won't help you out. It's the difference between unintentionally buying a stolen bicycle and asking Reddit how to shave the serial number off a bicycle.
Hope this helps!
Ninja edit: Also, I'm obviously not a lawyer, CPA, or otherwise financial professional. Do your own due diligence, especially if this is a significant amount of money.
