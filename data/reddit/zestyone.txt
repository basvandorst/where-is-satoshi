I program side projects!
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:47:06
My favorite project is  -- resources for developers that don't suck. Designed and programmed by moi only.
I also just launched  a few days ago which is already getting massive attention. Also programmed and designed by moi. 
Quite proud of both of those.
