Imagine if you hadn't sold at 4k

And they probably did it for $50 and a free t-shirt

And after 10 days of it aggressively going up.  He 'waited' too long for proof.  But I doubt he ever had any

Gemini Active trader.  Go to your profile, follow instructions.  Stupid you have to request it, but it goes back to their old fee system.  Instead of $2.99 or some garbage.

Yea, but he didn't.  He probably never had any to begin with.

I understand this sentiment some....but when it kept dipping and crashing and was hovering around $3400-$3500 for so long.....how much further did you think it was going to go?  If you aren't DCA'ing, maybe just use a quarter or half of what you're planning and buy that?
Of course now I'm saying I wish I bought more.  But I was actually able to grab a fairly good amount (for me, small timer) below $4000.  I was buying a little at a time after it dropped below $5500 (what I originally got in at last year).

I don't understand these comments?  It's still up 48% in a month.  Because it had 2 bad hours? (That is is already recovering from)

It's climbing back now already.  Like a lot of people are saying its reminiscent of 2017.  Bonkers right now.  Trying to play the market is almost certainly going to end up badly for you.  Either sell at a profit and be okay with it taking off, or hodl.

See OP and original post, lol

First post and you're asking for a cool $500k.

DCA is honestly the best way to go, especially if you don't want to obsess over violent price swings like this.
I've bought about what I'm going to for the most part until my work situation clears up more (I may be changing careers soon).  But on a day like this I buy a little and just keep stocking away.
DCA for long enough and you'll hit the highs and lows and just keep building your amount up, fewer worries!
