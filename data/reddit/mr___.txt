In 2014, uploading a RAR is a pretty odd way to share your open-source project.  Even using a RAR reeks of the pirate/warez scene.

Complied exe and source code not viewable.  Sketchy.  Maybe put the source on github or bitbucket?

Reads like an ad

ICQ???? Any other method? How about a PM?

Serifs on the top and bottom strokes of the B, as most renditions of the symbol include

Pretty sure theres a magic byte and some base58 encoding too

Look at the 2nd level orderbook (depth chart) at bitcoinity.org
The depth at any price is how much you’d have to buy/sell to move the market to that price

Cheers! It taught me a lot about markets

Nothing is "taken out" to generate any block reward. Block rewards are in fact 100% "newly minted" and are the sole fount of new BTC.
They are completely separate from transaction fees , which are offered by the sender as an incentive for handling the transaction.

I just sat at cafe table and sent the transaction from my phone when the other guy handed me the cash. No paper wallet needed.

Realize that some quadrillion hash operations are required to solve a block due to the current difficulty, but the nonce only has 32 bits.  You basically have to be trying all kinds of combinations of transactions, because you have to cover a very larger space of hash inputs, and a modern hash rig will exhaust the nonce in seconds.

Crypto smart cards generally allow the private key to be unretrievable. The crypto engine on the card is the only thing that has access.  No employee would be able to copy such a key.

It's a depth chart, with a rotated standard price chart overlayed so they share the price axis. "Now" is the bottom, as though the current market price as a result of the orders on the book is being plotted as the price chart moves "up". 
Not sure what the left side bars represent

Hey I bought holographic stickers and poly envelopes from that guy... I even have the sticker he sent me pasted to the rear window of my car.
And if it wasn't priced in BTC I might have thought it was expensive!

Please carry tall sizes! If you advertised it (maybe on you'd have an under-served group beating a path to your door.
p.s.... I don't mean 2X, 3X etc. (They just get wider)

I fixed that depth chart with a userscript:

This is how the experienced traders on  do it quite often, assuming the parties have good reputation in the web of trust system.

double vertical bars from top/bottom  look way better.  lets just get that well known one in Unicode rather than fragmenting the effort, please

I can't believe this stunt netted him $25k, but then again if I was holding 1000+ btc, the increase from the extra publicity is probably worth it, and I might send 5 btc in thanks
