I agree with using satoshis as its the most sensible unit and using whole numbers is easy. The name "satoshis" being four-syllables isn't perfect but its better for general understanding and adoption of the currency than extremely complicated, confusing fractional units.
@_date: 2014-09-20 20:26:32
mostly the fact that most places are using whole bitcoins, some are using milibits, and only a few are using bits. Its confusing.
@_date: 2014-09-20 20:53:42
they might think it has inflation at first that is true, but it would not be hard to educate them on this matter, and infact that education could have real value in distinguishing bitcoin from existing fiat.

seems like SMS proxies are really critical to reach these parts of the worlds, and to allow bitcoin to be useful in them.
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:33:25
general bitcoin using population, seem to be some services including bits, but more still use the extremely confusing milibitscoins 
@_date: 2014-09-22 16:51:19
Be dead dumb simple
- this doesn't work well with how bitcoin is denominated. How much is 0.0358 btc again?
-no ugly, raw bitcoin addresses ;  ABSO - fucking - lutely this

this could not be more clear/obvious, but people, even tech savvy open minded people like bitcoin users, are very resistant to change.

site has a red WOT warning, proceed with caution!

what is Circle?
@_date: 2014-08-20 19:08:07
tell that to the thousands of professional poker players who had to move outside of the country to support themselves
@_date: 2014-09-12 18:47:01
hopefully this pans out. Right now for me to buy bitcoins I have to pay about 10% vig (immediately/few hours to receive), or shop around for a lower (3-5%) vig deal on localbitcoins. Its like this in most places I imagine
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:31:45
its confusing, and hard to keep track of them. SOrry. Milibiticoins. Its either 1/100th or 1/1000th of a bitcoin but I am not sure.
@_date: 2014-08-20 02:12:38
@_date: 2014-09-12 18:49:04
very poor logic here, I have a reason to think bitcoins are worth something: I can sell them for dollars instantly. I can buy gold with them, I can pay my utility bills with them and top up my phone.
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:22:41
these are great but they are intimidating to a newbie, I am sure. I didn't even want to read through all of it right away as a seasoned user.
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:10:43
also, when it becomes cheap to buy. I would have to pay serious fees to purchase bitcoins
@_date: 2014-09-25 23:30:37
we need to move away from .1 BTC, no one likes fractions. Congratulations on owning some bits! :)
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:57:17
35% of US consumers "likely" to buy bitcoin
@_date: 2014-08-21 19:00:53
seen it twice so far
@_date: 2014-08-29 23:04:54
how would they be able to access those?
@_date: 2014-08-31 02:19:01
something like this is pretty clever, and desperately needed, with the decimal point marking whole bitcoins, with various markers representing other denominations
@_date: 2014-10-01 02:35:00
nobody understands fractions intuitively, which is why we need to move away from 0.0003845 btc as std denomination
@_date: 2014-09-04 13:31:38
localbitcoins or bahtcoin.com for easiest transactions, theres also  for a reputable exchange
@_date: 2014-09-20 20:01:56
we are stuck in a rut because of illogical use of full-unit bitcoins. We need to be using the atomic unit (smallest possible units and whole numbers)
@_date: 2014-08-23 00:12:44
insurance/consumer protection for other bitcoin purchases
@_date: 2014-09-12 16:58:35
the low friction aspect of bitcoin only applies if you already have them , theres a huge amount of friction in acquiring them to begin with
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:34:01
typo. It is the smallest unit currently, and it gives WHOLE numbers, which is the important part. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 04:41:28
localbitcoins.com look for cash, easy. Alternatively, Wstern union transfer (but you need ID, if you don't have your wallet you might need to do just cash)
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:38:39
just bought $100 worth of BTC with thai bank, $105.3 withdrawn, not bad! Took only a few minutes. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 21:39:59
selling insurance is profitable for a reason
@_date: 2014-08-27 21:52:54
I agree to some extent, but this depends on the target audience also. I was talking to a large group of people who are smart, educated, have a lot of problems with the current banking system, and fail to see any use/value in bitcoin. For these people some graphic showing how bitcoins can bypass the restrictive needs of banks to send money would have been a huge selling point. A picture could say a thousand words
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:32:49
yes we definitely need unification, its confusing otherwise. Bits make more sense than milibitcoins or micro, I am not even sure what those are exactly.
@_date: 2014-09-28 19:51:18

I am curious to see what happens if most of the miners decide to do whatever it takes to NOT sell their mined coins at a large loss. I would imagine this would raise the price, as there would be less coins for sale and it would not effect the buying pressure. Seems like bitcoins are basically inelastic in terms of the price people will pay, but they are sold off by miners at whatever price they can get. Is that accurate? IF so, the implications of miners cooperating could be very interesting.
@_date: 2014-08-28 01:19:32
you can back up electrum private keys as well so if the phrase is forgotten they can still  be accessible?
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:35:29
people dont understand they don't need to buy a whole bitcoin, and so they don't.
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:36:50
the majority of people in the world are idiots. Why is excluding them beneficial to us? Its also making our own lives harder having to understand the value of 0.03495 BTC compared to 349k satoshi or whatever.
@_date: 2014-09-27 04:17:07
electrum is a great balance of ease and security. Memorize a string of words and your good to go.

bitcoin is a godsend for poker players. Most of my professional poker player colleagues have had to expat outside of the USA to run from ridiculous banking laws to continue to support ourselves/families (my good friend had to send money back home to a wife and family while staying abroad). Even abroad, its very hard to open accounts and deposit/withdrawl funds on poker sites with banks, because we are from America. Not totally related, but I hope one day bitcoins will help live poker players with this same issue! 
@_date: 2014-09-06 19:09:23
fewer people still understand how the internet works, yet here we are!

no its not legal, even playing poker is a felony in some states
@_date: 2014-09-23 22:53:45
didnt this happen last week?
@_date: 2014-09-21 21:41:11
start by teaching people to recognize the value of fractions like 0.00034234 btc's worth.  fractions are hard, and people need practice to use them efficiently.
@_date: 2014-09-26 22:25:07
Thai banks and bitcoin have an interesting history 
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:24:26
thanks this is a good start, its good basic information. It's not quite a "selling" leaflet though as much as it is a basic informative piece, but its still quite good.
@_date: 2014-09-16 16:01:18
also, I can buy gold at market rate but would have to pay vig to acquire bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-09-15 12:25:51
i hope steam doesn't accept bitcoins. It would be way too easy to buy more games I will never play

gayer to jerk off to people jerking off than to jerk off in celebration with eachother

do you expect people to adopt t hings they don't understand? 
@_date: 2014-09-12 18:47:42
why we need to use bits and not bitcoins
@_date: 2014-09-03 03:47:26
but.. when you decrypt the BIP38 wallets.. that will also be one of the longest 30 seconds of your life.
@_date: 2014-08-30 12:59:30
they don't have an address memorized that I can send to, but if they were able to generate one that would help..
@_date: 2014-09-30 03:17:06
5% fee for $100 worth of bitcoins instantly from a Thai bank, not bad.
@_date: 2014-09-12 16:59:26
