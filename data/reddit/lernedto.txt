The home page and my account are both working fine for me.

Absolutely, just Google bitcoin's use in Venezuela to see for yourself.  But if you sent your friend a bitcoin now, after three confirmations he could push some buttons on his phone, either in [Mycelium]( or else [Caracas's major p2p]( market and today somebody would show up at the location of his choosing with a literal *bag* full of bolívares.  Granted, Venezuelans prefer bank transfers because that much cash in Venezuela is as dangerous as it sounds, but it goes to show that Venezuelans understand bitcoin and because of that it fetches a pretty penny in that country.

I would sell your bitcoins for above market rate then and use the cash to buy whatever you want.

Yeah, and all of the local offer people would be happy to meet up with you at a local café.  They don't care if you have four legs and bark, as long as you show up on time and pay the previously agreed-upon amount then they'll sell you BTC.

Yeah, it's surprising that for such a corrupt government people still rely heavily on the banks.  But I guess if they weren't using bank transfers they'd have no option but to use wheelbarrows since the grocery stores still aren't accepting bitcoin or anything.

I couldn't tell you, but I know [Spendabit]( is widely-used, though it's more of a search engine than a all-in-one platform since I don't think they handle any BTC.

Circle excels at over-promising and under-performing.  You're on the right page complaining in a public forum, though, since they're much more likely to get back to you that way than through a private support message.

The [Mycelium app on Android]( is pretty good for finding people close by, otherwise it looks like a lot of people in [Rome]( could hook you up, if not in person then through a bank deposit while your bitcoin are held in escrow for you.  It really just depends on your preference.

Yeah [Circle]( [Coinbase]( and [Uphold]( seem to be the most popular.

Yes, and as I understand it the receiver doesn't even need to know what bitcoin is or how to use it.  I think a mobile phone and/or ID are needed.

What country do you want the cash deposited to?
