Roger is a thief and a conman and we all need to petition the state to have this person arrested and imprisoned. He is a danger to the echosystem and has stolen the bitcoin name!

Yes we should.

Bitcoin legacy should be protected by the state, as it had 1st mover advantage.... and its name should be protected. 
Bitcoin Cash has stolen the bitcoin name. Roger Ver should be in prison.

We should petition our representatives to stop this fraudster. Co-Opting the bitcoin name is a nefarious act meant to subvert the true bitcoin. The government needs to stop this person and they need to stop him NOW.

hear hear! Look to our moral leaders and future software for comfort. This is what bitcoin is all about.

Why would you want to endanger the ecosystem with a 2mb fork when an 8mb+ version currently exists? We can all sit back and watch bcash burn with no scaling solution.

Criminals! The government needs to do its duty and stop this fraudulent coin. Its a complete fucking scam. Roger must be stopped.

How bitcoin was originally designed, the network was to be heavily utilized, by billions of people as scaling took place **on chain**. Core/Blockstream/Segwit have redesigned the fundamentals of bitcoin, and have no answer to this question, as they want the majority of transactions to take place **off chain** only utilizing on chain transactions for settlement transactions. This is **not** how bitcoin was designed to grow.
Bitcoin cash, if utilized by billions of people, the miners will make their living off transaction fees being pumped into the network by the billions of users, as all transactions take place **on chain**.
Hope this helps.

We should all petition our representatives to put a stop to this blatantly obvious attack right NOW!
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:16:17
This must end. The state must step in.

Coinbase processed a stop/sell I placed Saturday night that got 'stuck' the entire weekend. They processed the stop/sell this morning, at the price it was entered at on Saturday night... essentially stealing over $500 from me in btc.

It is a trap. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:17:28
Because [these]( companies would attach their names to Peercoin?

In the 90's 'intranet' was all the rage. In the end 99% of those intranets attached themselves to the public internet.
