To answer everyone's questions:
1) yes, this was a verified account
2) no, i never have used silkroad, or their addresses, or even used TOR to access BitStamp
3) I have not (knowingly) violated any of their terms. 
4) it is not a scam. They have already closed my account, and responded with a generic email saying pretty much the same things as before.

I never did anything to warrant them shutting the account. No use of TOR, no illegal use of bitcoins. I've been a verified customer for 8 months. Bitstamp users beware. 
Here is my letter to them:
Dear Mr. Grčar,
         I fully understand the orders and I have already fully complied by withdrawing all of the bitcoins in my account. However, I am still perplexed as to the impetus behind these actions. Bitstamp has yet to inform me how I have violated the terms of use. After carefully reading the terms posted on Bitstamp's website, I have come to the conclusion that I have in no way shape or form violated any of the terms of use. Over the last eight months, I have properly attained a "verified" account, I have made several wires into and out of my Bitstamp account, and I have done a decent amount of buying and selling back and forth. In addition, I have recently started working to integrate Bitstamp's API into trading software that I am working on (I am a software engineer). Now that MtGox is no longer considered a viable exchange for trading bitcoins against the US dollar, Bitstamp is the defacto central exchange for bitcoins. I am shocked that Bitstamp would treat a longtime customer this way without any due process or reasons given. If Bitstamp wishes to remain silent as to the reasons behind their actions, they can rest assure that I will not.
       Kindest regards,

I will say this, at least they let withdraw my bitcoins first, which have already been successfully transferred.
