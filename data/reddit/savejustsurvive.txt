Are you a member of codecourse by any chance? That store looks familiar :)

Setup 2fa with a decent password and you'll be fine. :)

You're probably right, that transaction was made 9 years ago. And it's in Russian ����

Send the item signed and tracked and you'll get the money 1 day after it's been signed for. That happens if you sell high risk items with low feedback.

Looks like my gut was right. ����

Your funds are insured on their website, doesn't really matter if they were to get hacked.

Two factor authentication, you have the google authentication app on your phone and you pair it to their website. 
Then when you login with your username &amp; password, you'll be prompted to enter the secret code that will be generated on your mobile phone.

Cashed out at 8595.23. Lets see if that was a good decision....

Yeah, i'll try buy back in again after this madness has stopped :)

Go for it, I put $650 in 3 days ago and now i'm 9-10% up.

Don't use text message 2fa, it's not safe.
Download the google authenticator app from the play store.

I have a gut feeling it'll go back down again like it did the other week, that's why I sold
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:16:49
How's that profit looking now? ����

Stripe is 100x better than paypal. Just a shame ebay doesn't accept it

Not for small amounts no, if you were to store thousands of dollars and wanted peace of mind then sure, buy a Ledger.
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:24:32
I'll give it 24 hours
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:16:41
I doubt the amount I sold impacted the price one bit ha, if I can re buy in tomorrow at a profit it's a win win in my eyes.
