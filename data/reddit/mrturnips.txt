I may be wrong, but I think you mean the wallet company BlockChain.

The whole point of Reddit is to allow for discussion and to let the best stuff float to the top.
The r/bitcoin mods have devestated this community IMHO. It had deteriorated dramatically every since the BTC XT stuff started and Theymos was trying to control the conversation..
I really fucking hate the power trip these mods are on. Theymos inherited all these important channels for discussion and he has been fucking it up the last 6 months.

Congrats Xapo!
The most well funded Bitcoin company has copied Coinbase and Circle - with almost no fanfare or attention. Another flop for Xapo.

Xapo sucks. So much money and no imagination.

Looks like a "hardware issue"

You may be sick of it, but it is a serious problem. I have been a "bitcoiner" for 3+ yrs, and I think that the current state of this subreddit and the fact that the community is ripping itself apart is terrifying. It is like a slow-moving train wreck that none of the leaders seem capable of stopping.
I personally think it's crazy that core has refused to compromise on the 2 MB thing - it would be so cathartic for the whole project. Is it really such a big deal?
If we don't come to some understanding - I fear that we will see more of the same. Alternative subreddits to avoid censorship, division between community leaders and the rise of alternative protocols (like the one that cannot be named - how stupid is that). Blockchain technology is here to stay, and I think Bitcoin has profound implications for maintaining freedom and accessibility. But if this trend continues, the overall bitcoin project will fail to make a real dent in the history of money and humanity.

It is hard to keep up with everything ever since this subreddit went to shit. The level of censorship makes it so that I don't really trust the information here - I feel like the mods took sides a while back and there are lots of sock puppets mixed with screaming zealots.
My understanding comes from having a conversation with someone who attended the roundtable and the various blogposts that have been written about it - I was not there in person. 
To me it seems like a group within Core has dug in and refuses to consider a near-term 2MB bump that would satisfy a lot of people within the community. I tend to favor a near term bump - it seems within Satoshi's intentions, would bring peace to the community and would help with the full blocks. As a user of Bitcoin, I have had a few transactions that took 12+ hrs to complete last week. This is a major problem and, if it persists, it will limit the viability of the project.

how do you know it is maintenance?
@_date: 2016-03-08 20:52:46
I may be wrong. It was my understanding is that the last conference ended without much consensus and that the Core side wants to wait (perhaps a year) before increasing the block size to 2MB.
