I think the answer is for Argentinians to start selling goods and services for Bitcoin, and have relatives that usually send money from abroad start sending bitcoins into Argentina.

he can both hodl and spend, he can hodl to his coin and buy some new coins for whenever he wants to spend them right away, so he does not run much risk of being exposed to the volatility.

How about A google bitcoin Wallet that allows you to send bitcoins from your Gmail or google+ account to your contacts.   2FA would have to be a requirement offcourse

No one is being forced to use the machine, if you think the fees are to high, then don't use it. But for this douche to just come and do this, it is not alright, this people invested money in the machine, pay rent on their local etc, and they are providing a service, what this douche is doing is the equivalent of grabbing a cooler and go sit outside a bar and start selling cheap beer.

Look at the news, they have to start every news video by explaining what the hell is a bitcoin, and usually they do not even know what the hell it is, you think you missed the boat, well most people have not even heard that there is a boat, go get $10 and buy some bitcoin and let it sit there and see what happens, worst case is that you loose $10 not the end of the world i would guess.

There will be a point if we ever get there, when you can walk into any shop and buy anything for bitcoin, people wont ask the questions anymore, they will just know that you can buy anything with it. Nobody questions that people will sell you whatever for a bunch of paper, they just know that they can turn around and get stuff with that same piece of paper.

Here is a comment I made just the other day 
@_date: 2013-09-05 00:09:12
If Bitcoin ever becomes a success,  and you have bitcoins, then you made some money. where if you buy mining equipment even if Bitcoin is a success, you might still come out loosing. they are both gambles if BTC fails, you will loose with both. But at least with one of them you will win for sure if BTC succeeds. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:18:22
if mining is what verifies the transactions, what happens when mining becomes unprofitable or all 21 million coins are mined? who is going to keep verifying the transactions?  I am not questioning the system, just asking what happens then because I am sure there must be an answer to this or no one would have this bitcoin fever.

When you do a transaction you start getting confirmations pretty quickly, if you get 2 or 3 confirmations and the transaction seems to be ok, it would be very very unlikely the transaction will get rejected, the thing that takes more time is that Bitcoin does not stop at 2 or 3 confirmations, it does 10 (i think) and after 10 confirmations if everything looks good, then the transaction gets written down in the blockchanin and propagated to everyone in the network, and that is what takes a bit of time.  you cant spend it at first because it has to propagate trough the network. but again like some folks said, if I was doing a big sell I would wait for confirmation, but for a restaurant, it would be like taking every dollar you get and taking it to 10 different banks and have them check the dollars to see that they are not fake before you accept the payment.

I think Leo has a good Idea of what bitcoin is, but the idea of an interview is to show and explain to the regular folk what you are talking about, so you have to ask a lot of questions that you already know the answer to. for people like the ones here in this bitcoin forum this is a much better interview than most reporters from somewhere like CNN or even BBC would do. I wish Steve Gibson (he does a security podcast with Leo Laporte) had been there for this interview.

Bitcoin is a perfect currency for traveling, given you are able to find places to spend them. You do not have to exchange currency at the borders and pay fees for that, if you are smart about it and keep your bitcoins safe and well backed up, you minimize the risk of getting robed (thieves love tourist because they are people that are a bit out of their element) there are no extra high transaction fees for using your credit or debit card out of the country. So maybe these hotel will now get new costumers that will be specially looking for places to spend bitcoins while traveling. those people might check a site like this one to look for places to go while traveling

do purchase all you can with bitcoin, and buy the bitcoins immediately after you spend them so you are not exposed to the volatility, but at the same time, you keep those bitcoins flowing in the economy.

You do not have to buy a whole bitcoin, you do not have to buy a whole bitctoin, repeat after me, I DO NOT HAVE TO BUY A WHOLE BITCOIN. you say you have no money to gamble? look in the couch on your livingroom, maybe there is some spare change there, look in your wallet there might be a buck or 2 and use that to buy some bitcoin, I do not know why people seem to think that they have to invest thousands and thousands of dollars to get in.
@_date: 2013-04-27 11:55:22
and Amazon probably very politely asked a guy to shut down his website, where he was trading Amazon gift cards for bitcoin. So this wont fly.

Localbitcoin can be very secure if you follow some rules like, don't meet in a dark alley, and don't come with a suitcase of cash. the bitcoins are quite safe if you ask me, it's just the money currency that is a problem as it is in any transaction when you have hundreds of dollars on you, I hope in the future we can have all the money in a secure virtual wallet that can't be lifted from you 
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:03:50
Maybe they can have this conversation again when the price hits $1000, maybe he will listen then 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:34:02
Good thinking, I would just change one thing, lets say your BTC is worth $1000 and you where going to buy a $1000 laptop, buy a new bitcoin with the $1000 you where going to use for the laptop, then buy  the laptop with the new bitcoin you got, by doing this, you are circulating the bitcoins into the economy which in turn gives them more value, and you did not pay $1000 for a bitcoin, you paid that for the laptop and that is what you where going to pay anyways, you still hold your original coins at whatever price you bought them.
