with crypto the word "secure" is synonymous with a third party, which is why I am concerned. the spread between exchanges is something I find alarming but security is so important there's no way around it. could crypto just be growing another shadow banking group and we're just starting an exchange war?

i have no plans to buy bcash but have entertained the idea. either way, watching bitcoin has made my life more exciting these past few weeks and I am ready for more

coinbase made a very ballsy move today. a lesson in power. move your money out now.

is it faster moving it to gdax?
looking into cold storage myself

is there a reason I shouldn't buy bcash at this time to hedge my bets? this is all so exciting but the potential to miss the boat on something is so large I am concerned that bcash could come from behind long term due to its practicality

but what are the odd that the public are smart enough to see that difference once the mass adoption comes through?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:49:07
because there wouldn't be a split in the crypto community for no reason.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:52:23
bcash wouldn't exists unless there was some form of argument in it's favor. i don't think it's just  ripoff I think it's like  2.0 build maybe

I am on board as well with the sentiment. this is the nature of a decentralized currency as it stands. exchanges have a chokehold and massive power vaccuum forming that they can fill.

they did clear that's the issue

this will rattle some cages for sure. i see a rough 2 weeks for btc.

verification limbo REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

I am praying. bitcoin is something different for me....it is a revolution of a new tech-priest caste that can circumvent the current power structures for good.

Just moved to Gemini. Put 100 into a wallet and waited for it to clear from my bank account. Bought ether and can’t transfer it because it tells me it needs more time to clear the transaction from my bank. Would have been nice to know before I bought. I was planning in trading it for XVR

feeling bad for anyone who lost on this. hope you  guys aren't too discouraged I think we can describe this as growing pains that will clearly continue for a while
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:26:29
can anyone provide a bcash devil's argument? there more I think about it the more I understand it's advantage.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:38:51
they announced it, and then it immediately became available and bots ate it up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:33:46
can anyone tell me what limitations there are for non-verified accounts on gemini? my bank account is there but I am afraid to try anything. I'd like to hop back in but do I need to wait until I get verified? there is zero info on this on their site. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:50:50
I agree just wish I new that. This first transaction was a bit of a trial for me on Gemini anyway 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:45:44
governments across the globe would be smart to invest at this point. i am sure they are

Commenting for later thanks OP
